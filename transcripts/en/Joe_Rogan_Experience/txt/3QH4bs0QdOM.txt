Speaker 1:          00:00:03       We're sneaking this in on people. They didn't even know. I just tweeted it just now. Yeah, we're sneaking it in. Duncan trussell best way to do it. He thinks so that way for for people that didn't expect it and then just like going through their little computer in the twitter comes up like, oh my God, I could watch a podcast with Duncan trussell now that's too sweet right there, and he's got a solo hunter shirt on. By the way, don't get. Duncan has gone. Gangster poser, poser hunter. I'm wearing a hat and a hunting shirt and I had you been hunting? I've been hunting more than. Well, I've been running a few times and I. This is a controversial statement. I think fishing is a form of haunting so that it is now it's hunting for aliens. They don't even breathe our air. I know they're weird.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       They breathe air or the water. Yeah, and you. You know you got it. We just went fishing and we had those popping corks where you got to make the sign of a fish eating so that it's truly trying to communicate with an alien because they hear that, oh, like a lure popper, sal pop. It sounds like when their grip grabbing bugs out this surface, see you're communicating to them, you're making their noises and then renting them out of their dementia and holding them and taking a picture with him because the ones we got were too small and throwing them back in. Yeah. I was with Ari and we, uh, went on the salmon run. We caught some salmon in Alaska and it was one of the most bizarre experiences ever because you know that these animals, they're going to die essentially. They're swimming there so they can fuck and then die and you're, you know, you're taking part of it and they're all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       They were giant, like we caught some like 30 pound, 40 pound salmon, which is so fun. I Love Sam and Matt. That's the, those are the, that's the worst marathon of all time. Which is you, you fuck. At the beginning of it, right? That's what it is. You're fucking at the beginning and then you're just running. Don't fuck. They never fuck. They just come on eggs, so you're just. You're going upstream to jerk off, jerking off all the way up while being ripped out of your universe by bears and humans in birds. Raptors are coming down. Snap you out of the water.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       Fucked up. Can you imagine the last thing you hear is like the whoosh of air and slobbering sound of a bear eating. Just hearing your body crunched. That's it. And you flip it up. This river trying to go up this little embankment, just trying to get up to sort of waterfall, just doing your best flopping around and you get caught in midair by a monster wild dog that weighs 2000 pounds. I bet there's salmon. I bet there's like inspirational salmon speakers who was everyone's running. They're like, wait, can do it. You can do it. Just believe in yourself and we'll get to the top of the stream where there is heaven. No, it's a mad genetic dash. That's all it is. Just a mad dash of genes trying to get through this weird pipeline where these giant bears live to the biggest bears in the world. By the way, the biggest barriers in the world in as far as like brown bears, it's between Kodiak bears and polar bears. Polar bears eat seals and shit, but the brown bears the biggest brown bears in the world. They didn't live on near the salmon rivers because they just fatten up. Oh yeah. That's. I love watching the bears. That seems like a great incarnation. The incarnation is to get a bear is one of the good ones, especially one of those bad ass salmon bears. They just lay around. They fight each other. They're always dirty and covered in flies, but they don't care. I would say yes, except they're almost 100 percent cannibals.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       I mean, who are we to judge? Have you? Maybe they. It's delicious to eat another bear ceos. By the way, I know you probably saw this, but it does need to be mentioned that just hit the Internet. You've seen the seals raping the penguins, right? I heard about it. I didn't watch it. To watch it, man, I can't watch it online because it'll fucking get us pulled from youtube. That's like a statement. Now get us pulled from youtube so you can play it up there and it's not online. We're going to try the new thing. What if it's on Youtube? We're going to try the new thing. This is so nice, man. Yeah. We have some new setup that we just started looking at. Sam kinison louder than hell. What to watch. You could watch on youtube now. That's incredible. My greatest hits. Yeah, so what's going on is that seals are sexually harassing and raping penguins.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       This is what it says. Now. This is not. This is not harassing. This is rape. I didn't see any pinching. Their assets are like, hey sweetie. No, they're. They're raping them. Listen, like if, if you're saying sexually harassing isn't interest attempted rape, it's just they weren't successful because it's not like they're communicating. So how else can be the. That could be sexually harassing. Harassing is like. I think that's putting way too much intelligence on these seals. Well, once, once someone's trying to rape you, that's assault sexual assault at the very least. So even if you don't fuck you that sexual assault, these aren't. These seals aren't eating on the penguins man. They're not like texting them to march there. They're climbing on top. And what? You got to see this man, look at that. Oh this, this is crazy. This fucking poor penguin just listening to this. This poor penguin just sits in the seal and starts trying to fuck it. It's awful. It's awful. It's no, there's no scale. Rather sits in the penguin. All the other penguins are kind of watching and is embarrassed, sad way because they could be next. They can't do anything about it in this seal. Just holding this penguin down. Look at it, trying to peck at them. And is Paul Simon playing

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       to this? This is so fucked up, man. This is so fucked up. And this is like the, you know, this is like when monkeys figured out how to use tools. There's no going back man. Once they've been living with these penguins for so long, horny not knowing what to do and that seal is the equivalent of Tesla seals because he figured out that you can fuck the pink ones ever. No.

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       Here's the big question. When it comes to animals, we, we're, we're attaching our idea of what it would be like to be fucked by that seal, this humiliation, the, you know, the social ostracism, the word ostracization, the horror that the trauma of all that, but do they register those things the way we interpret them, like we're interpreting them and then sort of a social contract construct. Right. We're interpreting if that was us, that was me and I was on the beach and there was a grizzly on top of me raping me, which is essentially the physical equivalent. Right. Your friends kind of marching by would be super upset. Your friends just standing there watching you get fucked by this grizzly bear. I would be really upset. Hang in there joe. But I mean, once they, once this, what's the seal that's a penguin dot. He's probably like the penguins just psyched to be up. Like I don't, I, he probably just happy lived, you know, I bet they don't really feel embarrassed. I bet they're just like, they don't want to get fucked, but they deal with it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       We don't know, man. It's one of the great mysteries of the universe.

Speaker 3:          00:07:37       What do you think? I mean, it probably doesn't even care if it's a male or a female. Penguin is like, fuck you, you're all girls. To me, goddamn giant seal, warm and oily. That's all it needs. We attach all these ideas to animals. We love to do that. And one of the big ones that we attached to animals, it's like our own interpretations of what something means. Our own versions of it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       Well, yeah, and it all goes back to the idea that the big question is, is our, our brains the things producing our sense of awareness and self or is there some other disembodied awareness that sort of goes through organic matter when it has the right kind of nervous system and creates the sense of self. But if you believe in the mechanical idea, uh, the materialist view that it's just a bio computer, uh, then the penguins experience is probably just a very, something is hot and warm, pushing it down. It wants to get away. And when it gets away, it's not like waking up at night screaming or avoid seals that are, it's like the most kinky penguin of all time. Maybe

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       he's just playing hard to get, oh look, there's something wrong with flipper. Get a fuck me again. You asshole. He gets really

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       into it. He just like, starts leaving himself by the shore, falls

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       sleep by the shore, hoping the CEO finds him. He falls in love with the seal. It turns out that that's what he wanted all the long. You know, he always thought he was a top, but what he was just a really good,

Speaker 2:          00:09:13       strong bottom. You just needed to seal to show him the way. It's like that terrible intent. That website stopped prison rape.org.

Speaker 4:          00:09:22       We talked about that. Fun Terrible website man. But that's the one where it's got that poem, the Ninth One, ninth one who raped me. You know, how much of that is trolling, you know, you know what I'm saying? Who is performed at the battle of the roast battle? I have a CD in my car, the singer, uh, find out who it is. Find out who is the guy who played that song, that awesome song at the roast battle. Yeah. Find out who that is. He was fucking hilarious. Anyway, his song that he played at the roast battle, which was unbelievably funny, was based on a guy falling in love with anyone. I shouldn't probably tell the premise. I probably, she probably stopped right there. It's just really funny. And, but it's obviously fiction. Total fiction, right. Whereas we, we're reading the prison rape thing. We're assuming these are actual stories. It could very well be somebody that's funny.

Speaker 2:          00:10:24       It's like that South Park. I don't know, I think it just came out the one with the south park kids try to get their parents to stop watching what they call murder porn, which is like forensic files and stuff. You know, like you lay in bed. No one is watching forensic files because they're like, I really want to gather more information about this case to see if I can solve it. People aren't watching Nancy grace because they're like, I'm going to help find this missing child. People are watching these shows because they're getting off and a deep visceral way at other people's suffering and that website stinks that it's that kind of like

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       there's one arm. That's one option. The other option is feeding paranoid, right? Like if you go over grandma's house and she's constantly, as you know, those wanted, chose on and when the guy's face come, hold on, hold on. She shushes everybody trying to get a look at the screen, trying to memorize the student's face. You know, if I ever see him, boy, I'm going to call that guy. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       Wanted. He's wanted. Yeah. I don't know man. I think whenever I watch forensic files, it's just, there's this kind of like a terrible pleasure that comes from realizing that this world is like that and I'm safe in this nice hotel. You Watch it and you get this kind of like, wow, that's fucking crazy. It's like that. It's like that showed, what do you call it, showed in Freud or whatever. It's like that for whatever reason, human beings and the deepest part of themselves, if you're really honest with yourself, when you watch some awful thing on the news, it's not like your heart explodes initially with all this sweet compassion. You're like, what the fuck? Wow. Look at that explosion. That's intense, but it's not like you're weeping. It's not like tears are falling out of your eyes. You're just sort of in awe and then weirdly excited way about shit blowing up.

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       Carlin's got a great joke about it, but it's. This is like a bell curve, a show. There's a bell curve created where when something close to you is suffering, like if you're in a. If you see an animal that's sick or if you're something awful happened around you, you would be like, fuck, that's awful, and try to help. You wouldn't be like, this is weird and kind of cool, but somehow this bell curve happens. Where if that very same thing is happening outside of a certain proximity to where you're at outside your neighborhood. Usually in another country it goes from being this kind of morning hard, a weird kind of creepy enjoyment and that's what the news is making money on because if people watch the news and felt terrible when they watched disaster, nobody would watch the news would make any money. People like to sit and stare into the apocalypse because it's entertaining to entertain apocalypse.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       There's definitely something to that for sure. There's definitely some draw a part of it where we get this weird charge about watching inevitable destruction. Yeah, just not ours. Yeah, just not ours don't want that, but when you see it, whenever it's somebody else, you kind of feel like you dodged a bullet. I mean it's like it's. It's, it's a terrible thing, but it is true. People don't want to watch stuff that makes him sad. Like the humane society commercial, you know the thing that pops on when the eyes of the angel in the arms, the angel song, you can barely watch that because it's so terribly sad. People don't want that, but somehow the anesthetized war reporting the anesthetized or the sort of like foamed down aerial shots of a fucking drone strike with that kind of weird flash of smoke. You see the shapes.

Speaker 2:          00:13:51       Oh those are, those are trucks with people and um, but you don't see that like smoldering twitching human corpse or the guy limping away with his femur jutting out as he's like, one of his eyeballs is out and he's thinking about his wife and he's wondering if he's ever going to see her again. You don't see that. You just see this like gone. And Zoe that you see in the shade, that's nothing like a shade that you would ever seen. Real love. You seen that weird gray greenish, like, you know what I mean? When you, the, the representatives, they'll heat signatures. So all the people were just as sort of white and then they're like, it's the weirdest, most abstract thing. If you think about like how advanced our ability to film things is in 2014. Why is all the footage in this like weird black and white? You know, radar, dish looking fucking footage, like you don't really see video of those exact same things and hd, I don't know if it's because you can't get it

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       or because they're doing it at night. I mean I don't. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:14:55       Well, I think probably they don't want people to be like, Hey, this is just terrible. That stopped that. Like when they show that drone strikes, imagine if they did start playing Sarah Mclaughlin or something. They don't do that. The military doesn't put that kind of music. Did their drone strikes? I feel when you, when you smash a bug, like if you smash a bug in your house, if I smash a bug in my house, I feel there's more of a sadness. When I'm like, God, I'm sorry, but you're a roach. I got to take you out, my friend. Do you have to go into the next incarnation now? And I kill it. Sometimes I take them outside. I feel more intense about that. Then when they show humans being exploded because they do it in such a quick packaged sweet way that we're all numbed out to it. We're all numbed out to the fact that those fucking explosions that are evaporating people or a hundred percent being funded by the money that is siphoned off of is every time we buy lattes or whenever we sell our life energy to other people that is being converted by some invisible power into human evaporating devices. We know that that doesn't occur to us at all. It's just like, yeah, well it's more I guess. Oh

Speaker 4:          00:16:08       look, they fight for freedom so that we can have freedom over here. It's true. It's true, but the problem is some of them do, man. Some of them do. And, and, and, and the real heroes, they go over there with real good intentions and there's also, it's not as simple as black and white because there's a real issue with all sorts of spots in the world with this human conflict. It's not like if we weren't involved in Afghanistan, all the shit that's going on in Africa wouldn't be going on right now. What? It's not like any of the conflicts that exists all over the world. The conflict between North Korea and South Korea, like all these, there's everywhere you look, the Russians were invading Ukraine. There's everywhere you look. People are fucking with people everywhere you look. It's been going like that since the beginning of time. So this idea that like if we weren't involved it wouldn't exist.

Speaker 4:          00:16:57       I don't know. I don't know about that, you know? I mean it would be nice if everybody was Canada. That's what it had been. If everybody was Canada, we wouldn't have to worry about shit. Everybody would just chill the fuck out. Canadians aren't pussies, but they're nice. They're nice and I think in smart they're smart as shit. I think one of the problems, one of the, one of the things that's going on with Canada is a candidate doesn't have his history of trying to conquer the world with all this history of like being involved. Like if you get involved in a conflict then you're involved in reverberations of the conflict, the rebound from the conflict, the post conflict, rehabilitation of the area. You're involved in a bunch of shit back and forth, back and forth. It takes a long time to not get to not be financially and socially and culturally entwined in that contract. That's crazy. People never think about that. Once you get in twined in any sort of conflict, you set a whole process in motion.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       That's not. Yeah, not just in war. In life in general. Whenever you get in a conflict with somebody these terrible. It's like. It's like when you're fucking ear buds get tangled.

Speaker 4:          00:18:04       Gotcha. Why resolving conflict feel so good. He realized just we both just got untangled from some stupidity that didn't have to be there in the first place, but when your whole fucking nation has been doing that for 200 years, man, it's, it's hard, you know, and noble wars, you know, like getting involved in world war two and try and stop the Nazi Empire, which was legitimately in like an evil empire run by a madman. I mean, if you really want to think about how crazy war was in the 19 forties, you have to take into consideration that this was for everyone knew that they were working towards some ultimate weapon. Okay. Everyone knew this. Everyone knew this was one of the first wars ever that was fought with airplanes, but world war one, world war two, they figured out they could fly over to places and start bombing them.

Speaker 4:          00:18:56       So people in other continents. We're at war with people. I mean there was some high scale shit really for the first time in human history because before that it's like everybody had to come over on a boat. It took fucking forever to get here. When they got here, they got scurvy fucking pick them off at the beach. It's like no big deal. Oh, we brought our canon, so good luck getting to the shore, which is just fucking sink you before even get close to us. We had canons over here too. Stupid. Right? And you gotta take your boat and go far where the canons can't shoot you. I mean it was a really short place, a short distance warfare. Then all of a sudden it becomes the 19 hundreds and people can fly fucking planes and they're just flying in and dropping bombs. Not just dropping bombs but dropping a fucking nuclear bomb on two cities. So they're just saying, fuck military, fuck military know we're at war, war, war, war means it's not like we shoot your plans and you shoot our planes. No, we're just gonna drop an annihilator. Have a bomb, a bomb that doesn't give a fuck who it hits. We're not thinking about collateral damage. We know we're going to kill 100,000 women and children at least. And we're, we're, we're willing to do that. We're willing to go thank press that button to stop this bullshit. Woo.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Yeah. That was a big leap in the direction of the apocalypse. They're fair. That's a timer. You know, man, I was just talking to Matt stags not two hours ago because I was trying to get him to explain the. What the fuck is that called the Fermi paradox. You know the idea that if. So there's two, there's the drake equation, the Fermi paradox. The drake equation is the equation that a bunch people at said he came up with, which is like, these are the components we would need for there to be extraterrestrial life and the universe. Let's gather all this shit up and we can get an idea of some random number of where this could be. It's kind of a shitty equation or because there's, it's based on one sample which is us, but still it's an idea of like how many civilizations are there out there and I can't remember which guy it was.

Speaker 2:          00:21:12       One of these guys said he, I think drake said he, and this is before kepler discovered all these other planets in the goldilocks zone. This is before that. He said 10,000 civilizations equivalent to ours. And then that gave birth to the Fermi paradox, which is, wait, if there's 10,000 civilizations just in our, uh, I think in the Milky Way, then that must mean in an infinite universe there's that, you know, exponentially more. Why haven't we seen them yet? And so there's all these reasons of why maybe civilizations don't make it into a turning into Canada, which would be a class two association. Uh, and that is because like, I'm sure we've all talked about this before we blow it, we blow our fucking ass is up. And that was when, that's when the clock started ticking right there when humans started dropping nuclear bombs on other people.

Speaker 2:          00:22:06       That's the beginning of that ticking clock that sets this terrible truth in motion, which is that here we have invented these devices, have absolute destruction and we're believing that our civilization, our society is going to last long enough to keep these things in our hands and not in other people's hands. And so in Pakistan, India, North Korea, Russia, all these tumultuous areas have these devices that evaporate human beings in mass. And clearly, if you look at the world right now, you could see with these masked fundamentalist psychopaths, but heading people, uh, and the, you know, what just happened in fucking Jerusalem, uh, with that hatchet looney coming in and just hacking up people while they're praying. And then that'll be followed by an insane attack on them. You see, we are existing in such a tumultuous civilization that there is a very high probability that nukes are going to get out into the world and that it could shut the civilization down.

Speaker 2:          00:23:14       The implication being this happens in all developing civilizations, moving from type one or class one to two, which is what we're doing right now, and that's why we should be putting a fuck load more energy into exploring just how important are all these various cultures everyone's adhering to that's making them feel like it's okay to evaporate other people. How important is a culture that says it's okay to to kill these people because they're of a different religion or they live another country or wherever. Like this is a mental disease man. We are already candidate where Canada filled with a bunch of different colored people who have a mental contaminants in their brain that makes them believe in various version of as if an invisible Megla maniacal doom god, you know, and so that's creating all this problem. That's the big frustration, man. Here's devil's advocate though. Of course. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:24:08       Devil's advocate is just because we are involved in all these conflicts all throughout the world and just because United States is definitely done some shit that most people would agree would be horrific. Yes. Most people, most reasonable people. Sure. If there was no military, if we had no involvement whatsoever, we could just pull out in a race all of our contacts with anyone all over the world. Would we really trust that some new crazy fuck wouldn't rise to some extreme Kim Jong Il type of power?

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       Yeah. Right. Like if we're like suddenly like, okay, no more military, everybody go home melting this, we're going to turn all of the guns and all the military bases and a utopian civilization or human beings can have access to infinite marijuana and float tanks. Like what you offer me when I moved in with you that time. Let's imagine that that happened. Right? Right. And that happens just in the United States. Meanwhile, I mean all these people, man, that too, they're a little butt hurt to put it lightly. So they're going to be like, oh great. So now you guys have your super telescopes in your Utopian civilizations and your beautiful palatial gardens that used to be military structures, but you remember the time you accidentally killed my entire family and everyone I know because you dropped the bomb in the wrong place because I do. I just can't seem to forget it guys.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       I can't seem to forget it and there's a lot of people that feel like that and so now we've created this terrible, terrible pendulum, a chain reaction. This bouncing back and forth of war. There's the essence of the problem. Israel in Palestine. How the fuck you just hacked up my grandfather, mother fucker. He was praying and you fuck two of you psychotic fundamentalists motherfuckers game and hacked up my grandfather and my grandmother while they were praying right after my wedding. You just did that to the rest of my life. I'm not going to forget about that motherfucker. And over there they're like, oh, oh, that makes you sad. How about you? The time you guys devastated my entire city. I just this. I sell fruit. That's my job. I sell fruit. You guys turn my fucking family and a hamburger meat. So I'm not forgetting it either.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       Back and forth, back and forth. Infinite war, infinite wars. So the. The question is how do we fix that question? Well, yeah, but I agree. It seems like the only way. Well, it seems that. Here's the scary problem, man. This is scary shit that makes a lot of peoples that will make a lot of like can, would make if you're a conspiracy theorist for some reason this scares people, but if you do look at that, obviously the Israel Palestine thing, I don't see how that's going to fix itself and if you read zealot by Reza Aslan, which you fucking show because you would love it. That fucking con, that place is just to that places like been having flare ups for thousands of years, just these terror that's the part of the human bio mass that has got some really, really sensitive hemorrhoids, man, and one slight little friction the wrong way and that shit flares up with war.

Speaker 2:          00:27:25       Oh, the time. Well, we've talked about this before. That's the cradle of civilization. Yeah. I think they're the townies of the world. Those are the people that never went. Civilization evolved in Mesopotamia, in the Sudan, Iraq and Sumir and all that. That whole area is like the oldest stuff that we know have really written language and mathematics and all that shit. They called Jerusalem. The Romans called Jerusalem a hole in the corner, that's what they called it because they just thought it was at, this isn't this great book and it's so good, but you know, yeah, that's what they thought of them too. And they invaded them and they thought it was like quaint what the, what was called the Jewish cult, which is that the Jews. So good man, that description of the temple, you know, the, where the Wailing Wall is now that got destroyed.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       It's so beautiful describing how that religion worked and the way he so good at articulating the, a strangeness of it, which is that you have this structure with all these levels that you are different people are allowed access into. So like you've got like this outer area which anyone can be at, and that's where everyone sells shit. That's where the money changers are. Because if you were going to a buy animal sacrifices in the temple, you can only do it with the, uh, Jewish money shekels. You couldn't do it with any other currency. So you had to change money there to buy whatever animal it was that you're going to sacrifice and you'd give that money to the priest who had purchased their position from the Romans, and so you would give that money to the priests and the priests, uh, you would be able to, if you were to be able to get into certain areas.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       But there was one area, the holiest of holies, where once a year a priest is allowed into this place with a rope tied around his body in case God strikes him down, they could pull his body out of the holiest of holies. And the idea was that the spirit of God on earth was just blasting out of there like some kind of nuclear reactor of spiritual energy. And so that place was constantly, constantly being invaded, constantly being overthrown, constantly probing problems, man, always having problems. And Jesus, this book, it's called Zealot and it's about the historic Jesus. He usually gets pretty boring to me, but this is real. Jesus was one of so many people back then who was saying it was the end of the world. And he wasn't saying it was the end of the world because he literally thought it was the end of the world. They just couldn't accept the fact that they worship the greatest God on earth and that the Romans had invaded. So therefore the answer was, it's must be the apocalypse. The world must be ending. So it's just this incredible place, man. It's fucking always in that state of target. It's out of balance. The places out of fucking balance, you know, it's always this. They're always getting invaded

Speaker 3:          00:30:24       there it seems like. I mean, if you think about countries that are far removed from war as like Norway, Iceland, Greenland, people live in Greenland, they should. It sounds like a beautiful place. Probably not really green. I think it's getting greener, which is global warming, California. That's going to be an amazing Hawaii in the future. I think it's called white land right now. Yeah. Well, you know, there was, they found a map of greenland from like the $1,500 or some shit where we didn't even know that greenland was a continent apparently until 18 hundreds, like the western Western civilization. But they found this crazy map unbelief. It was greenland, am I right? Or was it Antarctica? It was one of those, but they found this really ancient map that seems to suggest that there was some people from a long time ago that knew a lot more about making maps and about where continents were and then maybe the continents were different, you know, at once we know about like, you know, we know about the stone age for like 10,000 years ago where the, uh, the ice age or other were like 10,000 years ago in North America was like covered in ice.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       While they think that it's possible that some time before then people got good enough so they can make a map and then they sort of pass these maps down. There's the map. Is this cool? It's, it comes up when ai starts greenland, ancient map. No, it's fuck was just, it was like, it was just of the continent. And it was really unusual because the continent up until that point had been like covered in ice. Forget the story. God dammit. I hate when I have a half a fucking story in my head like that, but it's something along those lines, but point being when you, when you talk about Israel and Palestine and you talk about the Saudi Arabia and Iran, that those ideas to America and sometimes seems so abstract. It seems like that shit is just over there, but like if that was your neighbor, can you imagine if the dirt was closer and your neighbor was just fucking lighten your neighbor up with bombs? Yeah. People were flying in with flying jets. Yeah, man that don't even have people in them.

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       You know, this is the thing. I. When I worked at a summer camp, if a bunch of kids, by the way, every great story starts with when I worked at a summer camp, kids were getting these fucking fights, man. They're getting these ridiculous fights and they begin like they become like arch enemies. It's amazing how much venom can spring up between two to 12 year olds, but they will become arch enemies. And so one of the things that you would do after they'd gotten in a fight is he make them sit together on a bench for two hours. You just, there's a bench. You guys have to go sit on the bench together. Nobody's around them. And inevitably over that course of two hours, they usually will make up and they'll become best friends for the rest of the summer. They'll talk and like they whatever the fuck the thing was, it just naturally heals itself.

Speaker 2:          00:33:24       Right? So now God forgive me, I'm, I know that that is one of the most awful naive oversimplifications of a thing, but eventually the people who aren't blowing each other up on a daily basis who are sharing a planet with the people who are blowing each other up on a daily basis. And it's a planet where nuclear weapons exist and we're all so deeply connected and getting more and more connected every single fucking day. At what point does the planet say, guys, we got to put you on the fucking bench, man. We've got to stop this war. We just have to say, when, when does this civilization wake up and realize we are not Americans, Canadians. We're not a. we're not based on the landmass, Ron, we're earthlings, we're earthlings and we're all living together, sharing the same resources and somebody has got to recognize that we can give them longer that we play around with. We're all different and that's great. We're all different and we just are going to celebrate our own cultures. We're just gonna celebrate our own cultures into infinity and part of our cultures involves worshiping God damn warmongering death. God's that somehow make it seem okay for us to murder other people in the name of it. Eventually you got to be like, guys, sorry, we're not doing that game anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:34:46       Well, it drives me crazy when people start talking about religions is something to be respected, you know, respecting other people's religions. There's a lot of shit in religion that you can't respect if you're a rational person. There's a lot of shit like stoning for adultery. Yeah, I mean if you're really, if you're really advocating stone stoning people, hitting them with rocks until they die for having sex with someone, they want to have sex with your fucking crazy. Yeah. Do you ever seen those videos? I can't watch seeing the links. I'll never watched as a father and his daughter and it was so awful and he was treating his daughter, you know? I mean it was, it was sick. It was crazy. It was. He, he wouldn't talk to her. Wouldn't say that she was his daughter. He wouldn't look at her. He wouldn't, wouldn't touch her.

Speaker 4:          00:35:31       She wanted to hold her hand. He wouldn't hold his hand. She wouldn't touch him or he wouldn't touch her rather. I mean I'm getting flustered talking about it because it's hard to watch because you realize this is a father. He's going to kill his daughter with a rock because they both got trapped in some crazy ideology. This is his baby. This is his baby. He's going to kill his baby with a rock to show his love for an angry God that he's never lived. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. No, no. Yeah, no, but how? How do you enforce it and how do you do? You can't enforce anything with people. You've got to let people know what it really is. It's not the word of God. There is no word of God out there. What if there is a word of God? It doesn't belong to one fucking group.

Speaker 4:          00:36:15       That's for God damn sure. The idea that God came down and talked to one fucking group and his knowledge is the only true knowledge in this group only has anybody who tells you that is full of shit. Okay, so let's just start there. Let's start there. There's God's going to talk to everybody, going to talk to Chinese people who's going to talk to black people. Everybody's going to have a universal message and if it's not a universal message, everybody needs to sit the fuck down and talk this through because we might be getting some mixed signals here. We're not at war with each other. We're just humans. We're just a bunch of humans and this idea that you have to be at war because somebody wrote some shit down on animal skins or you have to be the chosen one, or you have to be the people that have the truth.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       You know? Why is the other religion saying this? It's simple because we are the truth. Everybody claps. I've seen that man. I've seen that in Islam videos. I've seen that in Christian videos. I've seen them say in Christian videos, these online things because who will the Lord? The Bible is the only true work of the Lord and everybody will go crazy on how do you know? How the fuck do you know? You don't know, and it doesn't mean there's no god. It doesn't mean there's no god. It means that you don't know. You're pretending, you know, because it makes you feel better and you're fucking with everybody else. When you do that.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       Most people I know who are the most radical atheists are, are, have been raised in those fundamentalists households and in that, I mean I consider that to be a form of child abuse, which is a. it's a psychic child abuse where you get, you get your will you get one plus one equals three for your entire life. Did I? I told you about the time where I was hanging out with Christian is right. Did I ever tell you about that? And one of the Hari Krishna says, when I was saying to the Hari Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita as it is, is the Bhagavad Gita with these reports by proper pot, the founder of the Hari Krishna's, and there were some things in their private pod said, I just didn't agree with. It didn't make sense to me. It didn't make sense. So I said to me, I don't agree with this here. And he goes, we don't say that we don't agree with proper pod. We say that we don't understand what prop pod means.

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       Just

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       stupid. It's not that easy. It's not that you have the ability to be logical enough to look at whatever the particular mythology that's getting diarrhea it all over your fucking brain and be like, no, this is wrong. It's that you're stupid or you're, you're possessed by Satan. Demons have taken hold of you. It's so when you're one of the most theoretically one of the most intelligent beings on earth, which human beings are and you're having this shit thrown at you. Then the fundamental one fundamental component of being human being, which is a part of you are like, nope, that's wrong. That gets subverted. That gets diverted. If that's not child abuse, I don't know what it is, which is why a lot of people are so a lot of many radical, radical, angry atheists. They should be angry, you know, and therefore that God that they are trumpeting, that doesn't exist. They should be trumpeting it. They should be doing tap dances on it's moldering grave and cheering and joy.

Speaker 3:          00:39:28       You know, another problem with religion is that it's very regressive in nature. Not that it's not progressive in some of its ideas because like a lot of Christianity, it sounds like really good advice. If you want to live a happy life, there's a lot of it, but the stuff that's regressive in its nature, it what it does is it basically goes against all of the known laws of culture and awareness that we have ever been subjected to, so our entire lives of reading books, our entire lives of interacting with people on the Internet, interacting with people in real life, experiencing films and experiencing art and experiencing all the different things that people have created and noticing that it's getting better and better and smarter and smarter all the time. That science is getting more and more aware, more and more capable technology. It's fucking exploding at this unbelievable increasing rates. Everything is newer, better, faster, smarter, more advanced, more intuitive, more interconnected except religion. Religions like hit the brakes. We're going to go back to the time or writing shit down on animal skins and they're like hanging onto this wild stream of information and digging their heels in the dirt and saying that women shouldn't be allowed to drive.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       Right? They're essentially what they're doing is keeping us stuck on this fucking planet and not flying into space. Interstellar ships, no, it's true. It's true because it's such a divisive thing and it's based on such idiocy. Most of it. It's been not idiocy. It's based on very colorful, beautiful symbols which represent arche typical aspects of the human experience and that you can use to like help yourself wake up, but the literal interpretation of the motherfucker that's keeping us stuck on the planet, and that's weird when you consider the idea that Graham Hancock talks about, which is the notion of the demiurge or the fact that indeed there is an interdimensional nemesis. That these people are worshiping the Jehovah God who appeared in the garden of Eden and said to Adam and eve, don't eat the fruit that makes you know the difference between good and evil.

Speaker 2:          00:41:31       Don't become human. That God, that Satan, that God was trying to keep a stupid and dumb. It's like a really advanced alien consciousness that's like, let's keep the monkeys is diamond divided as we possibly can because then we can extract that delicious fear for them that we like to eat. And so now if you look at Graham Hancock's version of it, it's kind of scary to think that the direct result of all these various world religions that have at their core, this mega maniacal doom God, they're, that they, they're the very things keeping us from being free from the gravity well that we're stuck in. So it is almost as though there were some kind of dark force. It's like keeping you trapped on this planet so we can keep eating them. It's our food source.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       I don't keep them trapped, trapped, live off fear. Yeah. They live on the air with a straw like a coconut. When you drill a hole in it, coconut, they just tap it in fear. Keep them scared. Oh, have you tried earth yet? It is so filled with fear.

Speaker 2:          00:42:39       Oh, you should go over to earth. It's good. They're terrified. Those monkeys are terrified. They don't realize how powerful they are. They never will. That Jehovah has done such a good job over there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:48       I have a less supernatural idea. My idea of why it's like this is that it's a communication issue and that the old communication, the old information is still getting fucking bounced around over in the spot where they figured out communication first and that here we are in 2014. The further we get away, the more you know, like look, the West Coast is the furthest spot from the east coast, which is where everybody landed and it's just pretty commonly known that the West Coast is more progressive people more relaxed. It's like the California lifestyle. People talk about it all the time. It's not just a matter of, oh, the beach is here. Everything's cool. It's no, it's everybody got as far away from the bullshit as possible. The bullshit was like my family were Italian and Italian and Irish immigrants and all those people that landed there, they all landed there within decades or generations was all these crazy immigrants that escaped Europe, which has even more fucked up and you know, you go further, further, further, you're going to get to Iraq, you're going to get to sue mayor.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       You're going to get to the fucking epic of Gilgamesh. I mean, that's what you're getting to. It's all mapped out for us. It's all real obvious where everything got pop and everything got started. The people that stayed were assholes that were assholes with ridiculous ideas and everybody tried to revise your ideas. The further we got away. It's like Noah's Ark is essentially the epic of Gilgamesh, right? And there's Hercules. You can compare Hercules with Jesus. I mean, there's a lot of these fucking stories that are super similar, right? There's a lot of them. When you compare the, the actual core origin of like the like what was what was actually said, what? What actually

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       are you saying happened? The virgin gave birth to a god like, okay. All right. Just want to be clear. How many of these are there? There's a lot of these are, and you think about people just sitting around campfires. If they fucking shot or Ram with some homemade catapult and they're eating this meat over the fire, telling stories for thousand years before anybody writes anything down, you're dealing with the echoes of savages. That's really what you're dealing with. Literally sitting in front of a fire eating meat that they cooked. They killed with some fucking flint knife. Their ideas still hot. Our modern minds. That is so cool. No crazy at goes of savages. I love it. Yeah. What it is, it's a ghost story. It's like everyone's brain is haunted by this ancient goes story. They still floating around in there. We believe it so much and we're so good

Speaker 2:          00:45:29       terrified of abandoning it. That even now some part of me is I talk about rising beyond religion. Some part of me that grew up mildly religious might still a little part of me is like, Ugh,

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       you're going to curse yourself. If you talk about Jehovah, be careful. It's still get to your man. It'll get to you because

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       for what? We're just getting our heads up out of the goddamn water of delusion here and, but you know, not all religions, it's important to note that not all religions have got their feet in the mud. Got To stick up for Buddhism. It does not have. It's not kicking digging its heels in and point. It mutates. It's not about believing in, not all of it's got so many different forms, but it's about believing in certain fundamental truths in the universe.

Speaker 4:          00:46:20       Not also doesn't seem very greedy. They're never asking you for money. You never see a Buddhist late night televangelists with fucking robes on or rolex telling people. Every time you write a check to me, Buddha, I become very happy, very happy. Come with they check. All of a sudden he's Italian, Father Guido Sarducci. Yeah, you're right. You know what I mean? I mean, they don't have a late night TV shows. They don't have slicked back hair and wives with plastic faces. They don't drive rolls royces. They're just, they're just trying to figure out life. They're just trying to get through guaranteed. There's still sect of Buddhism that have the same kind of built in guilt principles course, right? Whenever people getting control of anything.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       Yeah, yeah, but, but the, the, the, uh, Buddhism as an example of, of a religion that can radically transform your life, minus at God just by the, the focused processed or not processed, the focus, disciplined assimilation of certain basic principles through meditation. You'll start losing the conception or the idea of where you stop and the universe starts. That's what Buddhism does. It dissolves that membrane between what you think you are and what everything else is through these meditative practices and contemplations and you really can pop out of your little I and get into the big I through Buddhas are and that's pretty bad ass, but and I think other forms of Christianity that invite you to lose yourself and love or lose yourself and selflessness or the idea of just like going from a receiver to a transmitter permanently. That's pretty bad ass too and that can radically transform your life and that God that they're talking about the god of love.

Speaker 2:          00:48:08       He's a god that we're in right now, but both of those two things are various ways of losing your little I and merging into the big guy and those are two that's very beautiful and I don't know enough about Islam to understand all the varying types of it, but I guarantee there's some version of Islam based on the poetry of Rumi and the mistakes that also points to this same. A dissolution of the idea or the concept of the little eye and merging into the big eye and that that thing that shift in the human in human society. If that happened, that's how we could get off the planet, but it for that. Do we want to get off the planet?

Speaker 5:          00:48:50       God, look at the fucking universe. It's beautiful. Awesome. Yeah. I'm fucking missing this here and we're going to do it. We're going to go somewhere else and get hit by a meteor there. Weightlessness brother. We're just going to experience weightlessness. Think about that either. Listen, he's not like Manson. Listen brother. What are you listening? Man? Weightlessness. So you get to experience the.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       The you get to as you get to take. I know I sound out of my business is terrible for your body. You know, you get osteoporosis and shit. You know what else is terrible for your body? Weight, weight being stuck on a fucking planet. We can, but your body's designed for this. It's true, but a lot of people say that. The reason they say that the majority of our DNA or the information in there now I'm starting to lift from Timothy Leary, it's so bad ass, but that the DNA inside of us is not the information there hasn't even been like barely used yet because encoded within it is exactly the same step encoded within whatever makes a caterpillar turning into a butterfly. And that, uh, right now our brains are based on not being able to fly. Our brains are based on being able to walk North, south, east and west.

Speaker 2:          00:50:02       But most people, they don't. When they're giving directions, they don't talk about altitude, you know, that's not in, that's not built in the way that we move around. So the idea of how much more our brains would evolve if we removed the planet earth from the equation and now realize that we exist in an infinite space where there is one day where there is just one day happening right now. We think that there's this day that keeps happening over and again, just because the goddamn planet goes from a light side to a dark side over and over again. And it gives us incredible illusion. It kind of metronome of time that we think, oh yeah, there's days and because there's days, there's years and all these years fold together to create a lifetime when the truth of matter is, there is not a day. There were either not a bunch of different days there just one day or no day.

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       There's no time, there's no space, there's infinite beingness. That's what we're in right now. But because of our current situation on this fucking gravity, well, it's given the illusion of days and minutes and seconds and then want whole lives become a race to fill those days and minutes and seconds and, and be on places on time and get mad because people aren't there on time. And the whole fucking thing is just a wreck. It's just a wreck. So one reason that would be nice to fly with this gravity where? Well, aside from the fact that would be fun to float in space, there's. I mean, come on man, there's so many things that you could do. So like it's Disneyland, zero who'd be amazing. You could go, there's this ride, there's that Rod. Can you imagine what fucking UFC would look like in zero gravity? Everybody would turn to soup.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       What do you mean? Bones would break? Everybody's body would dissolve. You're assuming that they haven't clearly in this equation, this ridiculous fantasy I'm having of floating in space. Uh, they've developed ways to like early too generate gravity. Since I'm fantasizing here, I get to say they've developed what? Fuck it was true. Then do it like a double gravity that will you come back to Earth. You're strongest where you go. If you wanted him, shit. That would be like the new thing that UFC guys would get popped doing. Dude, he was hanging out in double gravity. Oh, that motherfucker. That bitch. Yeah. He's got double strong bones. It's fucking head. Got An inch wider Joe. We got to go into space because it's like, I think it's just built into human beings to want to migrate. It's we came, we virus flirt with. Yeah we are, but what?

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       But you know, they're finding out now that you can re code viruses to fight cancer. They're finding out now that viruses can actually be transformed into things that are good instead of things that are destructive and that is my hippie ideology in my naive belief that there is a way that human beings can be re coated through technology and psychedelics and through some uninvented thing that hasn't happened yet, that creates a kind of state of technologically enhanced empathy that allows us to transcend these invisible brain boundaries created by the echoes of the savages, as you said, and once that happens, one of the byproducts of that, and by the way, you don't have to leave the planet and whenever I start yapping about optimum, appreciate it. I'll be here. You want to go fishing, you don't have to leave the planet, but a lot of us would like to experience what that's like and that's one of the byproducts, but maybe another part of the byproduct of this kind of merging or fusion is give a fuck about going into the universe

Speaker 3:          00:53:28       because you realize you are the universe. Yeah. That's where I'm at, Bro. Cool. I think space travel is a. It sounds awesome. It sounds like a really fun thing and I bet perspective wise getting above the earth would be magnificent for you. It'd be probably be life changing because a lot of those guys like Edgar Mitchell, whilst astronauts, the Apollo guys, they talked about the experience being like transcendent. If there was something about being above the earth and I think if we could get everybody to just fucking fly above the earth to. That's what we really could shift a lot of consciousness. We get everybody to go into like near Earth orbit and just see like, look at this thing that we're on and look at all this silly bullshit we're involved in now. Look at all that because that doesn't have a roof that goes on forever, so we're down here tripping out about this guy believes in that book and that God leaves in this bucket.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       It looks so stupid. It's like you ever been in an argument with like a brother or sister and then your parents come over and we'll you're arguing about just instantly seems so fucking dumb will either. Like what are you finding about. She's used my pay approach. It's not European brush like, oh my God, we're fooled like I want to pretend to be like older now. Want to pretend to be more mature, but I'm still six. You know what I mean? When you look up and you're looking down at our conflicts, all of them, every single one of them and you compare it to infinity, it looks so fucking stupid that we're wasting our time worrying about getting rid of the word bossy. We're wasting our time with stupid shit. We just constantly distracted by stupid shit.

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       That's right. Yeah. That's it, man. That's it. That's the kind of epiphany that the planet needs in mass and then once that epiphany happens, who knows the end result, but is it in, you know, the skeptic and the cynic would be right up until not very long ago, it'd be like, well, that's never going to fucking happen.

Speaker 3:          00:55:30       See, I don't like those words. I don't like. That's never gonna happen. I like. That would be difficult, but amazing. If it can happen. That's what I guess what everything that we do today never happened before. So that whole it's never going to happen is horse shit. If you go back to 500 fucking years ago and you bring them into a podcast studio, take someone, throw them in a time machine, throw him here in 2014 sitting in that chair and explain to them what the fuck is going on right now. They wouldn't even be able to grab it. It would be nothing about what you were saying. Even if you could speak their language, even if you could explain to them conceptually what a computer is the. There was no fucking way they would ever be able to imagine that this is real. Do you could just download movies on Netflix and watch them, Pam flying through the air

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       on why fly? Like what the fuck are you saying? It's not even connected anything. You have a magic box in front of you that's watching people fuck on it. This isn't the most insane thing ever. No one ever saw this coming. Okay? So whenever it's like, Eh, it'll never happen. Anything can happen. Almost anything. Yeah. And eventually anything, almost anything. We're going to get some fucking molecular control over this universe on some really deep level. At one point, if, if technology keeps evolving, it's not going to be just that we can blow things up. We might be able to build things. We might be able to create fucking universes. We might literally have a universe button that someone advanced one day where we can walk by the Science Museum and create your own universe. Do you want to do that? Okay. Press that button. Boom. And we hear it. Some of them from throughout the fucking cosmos because a new universe bubble just got shoved into that fucking, you know, those, those basketballs when you like the buzzer goes off and you're at a carnival and you gotta throw basketballs and the basketball to just bounce it around that little pit of basketballs and your truck. And um, that's universes and every, every you press that button.

Speaker 4:          00:57:35       You just made a universe. Debbie, Debbie Landia, and we're just going to have fucking universe buttons all over the universe app on your phone. Fuck it. I feel it. Create a couple of universities today. People being competition to see who created more universes while they were at work.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       Yeah, man, that's beautiful. Yeah. That, that

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       this universe brought to you by Yahoo. Oh my God. How much better you can make your own fucking universe better songs. You listened to the five second

Speaker 2:          00:58:03       sponsor. Yeah. See, I love that semen. What you just said is so beautiful because even as ridiculous as it may sound, it's still acknowledges and accepts the principle of novelty and the idea that you don't know what's going to happen and that idea of not knowing what's gonna happen. That is this Buddhist teacher. I'm really into his teacher. This guy I, John Chai, was this like forest monk party. With that.

Speaker 4:          00:58:34       Imagine that I want to make a movie. I John Chow, the forest monk.

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       He's a. he's a, he's a, you know they're are these Buddhist forest monks. They live in the forest. They sit at the edge of open graves and watch bodies decompose. They can process and understand the fact that we are impermanent, which is something Jack Kornfield did, which is amazing, but yeah, they'd sit at the end. Just watch for days. You just sit and watch corpses rot so that you clearly digest the fact that you're going to die because you are made of the same matter. You're not going to make it out of this so that you understand your attachment to the body is an attachment to a thing that is completely impermanent and part of the process anyway. This one of the things he said is when you go into an experience, go it not knowing what's going to happen. Go into it, understanding that today you don't know what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       Tune into that frequency. Tune into that place of like you really don't know, Matt and all the ways that you think you know and all the experiences that you've had and everything that you've used to determine how things are going to be. It's gone devoured by the time it's not there anymore. There's just this one moment right now and you've been using their construct. How things tend to workout is a protective mechanism because you can't accept the fact that you are infinity experiencing itself as this impermanent moat of meat and so that moving into those places is so exhilarating. It's so exhilarating, and if we do that as a planet instead of thinking what everyone fucking thinks are, most people think which is war is inevitable, conflict is inevitable. It'll always be fighting. If you go into it with the idea of like maybe not just maybe not. Maybe we can really figure out a way to do the pull up, pull us out of the God damn primordial, gory muck of believing invisible symbols that make it okay to kill children. Maybe there's a way to pull that out and end up floating in space or laying in a fucking super utopia where you're psychically ta merged with the entire universe through technology. Why not? Well, I

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       think it could be both. I mean that that can happen, but along the way I think what has happened is this mad need for conquering that people seem to have, especially men. I mean, we go back in history and what do we know about history? History is essentially military history, military and technology history, and occasionally events. I mean, that's what history is. The printing press was invented. The bottom wasn't invented in the boat. Well, once the Japanese would not accept the use of guns, they quickly lost at warfare. I mean that the military history of our world is the real history. When we talk about, you know, not it is what we talk about the civil war in this country. We talk about when we fought the British, we will, we. There's all this. The real history of our world is a history of conflict that's fucking crazy in, in conflict.

Speaker 3:          01:01:35       This is what's fucked up. There's innovation to Adam. Bomb came about because we had a threat. If there was no threat, there would be no adam bomb. I mean it literally was invented because people were terrified of someone inventing it first so that. I'm not saying that it's good thing to have nuclear weapons, but what nuclear weapons represent is a human mind set forth with resources to pursue a goal and what is possible. What is possible is this intense ultimate nuclear destruction possibility and human beings created that because of conflict. Not saying that that's a good thing, but I'm saying that involved in this conflict and struggle that people have always had the desire to conquer and fucking

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       live in a big house with a fat Mercedes and be fucking consume and private chaired and I want an on an island and raw that feeds this machine that makes technology that feeds this machine that is ultimately advancing us past the barbaric state that feeds this interconnectedness that we all have now on the Internet, right to the all that is because people before us were struggling and figuring things out and trying to communicate. You got to send a teletype today, Da da Dee da. Dee had to send a message to my friend on the west coast. He couldn't be on trouble. People over there can't be trusted and all this shit was invented in order for people to continue pushing this goal of conquering new lands and new places, new ideas and new fucking markets and you know, and new natural resources that are being tapped into and it's all a part of this thing that it's advancing us ultimately.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       So at the same time, at the same time, we're all this crazy struggle and trauma and old bullshit's going on. Darpa technology is being used on the Internet, you know? I mean, didn't they? Didn't they kind of advent of the Internet? Darpa, who was the. Who was the inventor of the Internet. I always forget that tidbit. It's so sad. I should know that. Something bizarre. Like, okay, let's pull it up, but my point being they are making crazy robots. Superintelligent robots you run up to when you kick them and they balance themselves out and bounced back up. They're making these robot cheetah has that can run like 60 miles an hour. Have you seen those fucking things? Yes, I have exoskeletons. Yeah. That's some seriously high level shit and it's all being made from military money. All that shit's being made to make better weapons and ot mean it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:06       Isn't it military money essentially Darpa? Yeah. What does it stand for? Darpa is the Defense Department and the Department of Defense. I don't know what does stand for something. Yeah, but what it is is like when it, I mean, you know, obviously don't want defense, airborne reconnaissance projects office. You obviously don't want them using it on you, but it's pretty fucking awesome stuff. I mean they're making robots do that run. They're making these like horse things, the kickup and they fucking, they, they move like the balance themselves out about the new flying aircraft carrier. Everyone's talking about the carries drones on its back fuck floating drone that's fucking Goddamn starcraft shipment and if you think about it, that's the, that's like the peak of technology when it comes to robotics and function. As far as like, I didn't mean I don't know about robotics as far as like a assembly line stuff. I don't, I don't. I mean maybe that's like super complicated at this point, but robotics as far as like things that are on their own, they're just walking around or flying around like things that aren't attached to you and you either use remote control or they know what the fuck they're doing. Autonomous Defense

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       robots, those things try to go into war with that. That's the equivalent of the airplane. By the way, when you were talking about the invention of the airplane,

Speaker 3:          01:05:26       Darpa wants to build an avengers like flying aircraft carrier to make drones even more effective. Start becoming like big mobs of birds. Like you know when you see like birds fly around and they're all in unison. Like when those start being drones attacking, that's when to Dunkin happen, man. I mean that's going to be one of the big privacy issues in the next decade is going to be drones. People are just gonna be able to fly drones over your house, check up on you, like your girlfriend's going to be like sooth them. Motherfuckers up to him. Fucking send a drone is way to fly the drone over. So you do today Duncan. Oh, nothing. Just wash the car. And

Speaker 2:          01:06:04       did you notice a tiny mosquito sitting above your computer as you were jerking off to that? Does this casting because it's outside the window because everybody thinks it's a big thing. That's. It's not a big thing man. That the drones that everyone's like, you have the drones will be flying over. No, they're not going to be flying over. They're going to be these microscopic little orbs that sort of drift through like a mist gathering information, gathering, biometric data, looking at eye dilation, whatever they want your fucking pulse. They give like maybe measure your exhalations to see what kind of food you've been eating. Maybe they can even tell how much you've been drinking, but the idea that we're gonna have the luxury much longer of looking up and seeing those cute, quaint, little flying big John's. No Way, man. We're talking tiny little. They must already exist.

Speaker 2:          01:06:55       I mean it's the most obvious. They I know that the. If you go to like a in DC they have like the spy museum and they show, you know, a little bugs, bugs that. That's why I guess what, that's what I call them. Your House is bugged, you know, so yeah, that really is. I want to, I don't know, but it seems like a possibility. I'm going to say it's real for now. God Damn the Internet. Anyone can look at shit up in the old days. You'd just say what it was joe, with more advanced understanding of the CIA, but the um, the, you know, how are you gonna? How are you going to scan every ant in your house? How are you going to scan every moth? Reverie, nat drifting by houses are going to have to have force fields that shut those things down when they fly in or some kind of way to dismantle or detect drones.

Speaker 3:          01:07:42       Yeah, there, there was A. I'm trying to remember what the actual story was, but there was a technology they were working on that was essentially going to be like a grain of rice and it's going to have wifi in. It is going to have a camera. It's going to have a gps signal and it's going to be able to transmit video and it'd be the size of a grain of rice and you could like literally scatter them throughout a city and you would have an accurate view of the entire city all the time. Like they would force people to start using certain amount of grains of rice, like type things in all of their house. Like, well we have a 30 grain house, so hey, if anything the government wants to know. I mean there's 30 grains in my house, like one grain in your bathroom, one grain in your living room so they know where you are at all times and it's got a wide angle lens that's a little tiny mosquito one, but this one I'm talking about isn't even a bug. What I'm talking about is actually a grain of rice. I mean they're going to scatter them.

Speaker 2:          01:08:39       Yeah, like Paulin. It's like these, these Darpa flying and this is like Alex Jones worst nightmares that Darpa aircraft carrier flies over and doesn't release little mini drones. It just releases a dust of tiny, a surveillance technology. These weird pollinators that just sort of float on top of everything, transmit back whatever you want, we'll show you inside of houses, it'll show you what's inside of people because some people are going to inhale it and based on like maybe the thing communicates with their phones so it gets a gps, it gets their identity and now it's inside of the being and it can start saying what they're eating, what their health is like. You know, Google is already working on this like an ingestible cancer detecting surveillance technology. It's like people think this surveillance is going to stop. Stop with just the outside of us, but all these new like health measuring devices, the Fitbit, the Apple Watch that gauge biometric and know. Right. It's crazy how much of that stuff can you imagine like dropping that shit on an army and being able to get feedback. Not just aware of the army was, but what they've been eating, what their blood pressure is, what their adrenaline, adrenaline levels. They're like, you know, like you could get a full feedback of like, well this, these soldiers are mildly terrified right now. Let's see if we can up their adrenaline gland production using our nano bots that they inhaled while they were getting ready for the fight. So they all have heart attacks.

Speaker 3:          01:10:08       There was a story from a long time ago, I believe it was like the 19th, 19 seventies or eighties. I forget what it was, but they shouldn't even say what the what the year was because I don't remember. I don't even remember what city was, what they wanted to find out. What would happen if someone had released some sort of a biological agent on a city, like if there's some sort of a poison gas or something that got released on the city, like how would it disperse and how far would it go. So they, they literally blew some like material that they could measure on the city, like blew it on all these people made these fucking people breathe it in and sprayed it. I mean that's like one of the origins of the idea of chem trails is based on the reality that they have done goofy shit.

Speaker 2:          01:10:53       We tortured some folks torch it. Yeah man, they do it and of course it's like the ultimate or weapon would be a way to like get infinite data on the thing that you're fighting. I mean it's the primordial essence of war is knowing what your enemies doing. That's the most, one of the most important, if not the most important facet of war. So the idea that you can surveil them without them being aware at all. I mean that commander who uh, recently was like, you know, they noticed that the press is like gone from b now you should be scared of isis suit kind of. Now it's turned into like, looks like isis is backing down. But uh, this commander, uh, to make the announcement about the potential death of one of their leaders said, we hear you. We hear what you're saying, to kind of like, you know, imply that we're. So you're being surveilled that we hear everything you're doing and we know everywhere you're going. And I think that's probably true. And that's got to be a little bit on the terrifying side when you realize that you're being surveilled by a super power with technology that probably no one on the planet is aware that exists yet.

Speaker 4:          01:12:07       Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you think about what Darpa has shown us they can do, who knows what kind of agencies the government has been fucking cooking up these crazy with. Yeah, sure, absolutely. But isn't that ultimately gonna work against them as well? Because isn't all technology, especially technology that you know, is small, like not talking about things like nuclear weapons and things that are difficult to acquire, but all technology eventually becomes easier to acquire. It starts off being super difficult and then x amount of years later everybody's got it. So ultimately everyone's going to be able to spy on everybody at every point in time forever. Yeah, that's the problem. Is the problem or does that keep going in that same direction? And do we accept some sort of a biological symbiosis with technology that enhances it and makes it even better at one point in time? And then do we eventually figured out how to make artificial parts that work better than all the parts of our body? How many people are walking around out there with artificial hips? Graham Hancock has an artificial hip. They know it. Yeah. Uh, Joe Perry has an artificial knee. I mean we're, we're making robots. They have parts in bodies that are machine that someone invented and you're, you know, it's being powered still by your tissue and your blood. But essentially they've put better parts in than what you had in there.

Speaker 2:          01:13:27       Yeah, man. I mean it all comes down to at some point people have to wake up to the fact that they're not just an eye, but they're also a week. At some point you got to wake up to that fact that you're not just the one little ewe. You're directly connected to the entire universe in your tiny little pixel of awakenness in this universe. But you are the universe eventually that's got to happen. And privacy, fear and the terror of being observed or in surveilled is 100 percent based on the notion of the identity. And like one of the last great taboos is the acknowledgement or the realization that in fact you're not an identity, you're not a single high. You're a big guy, you're a big guy and part of this a merging technology and that's what this shit is doing, man. It's not just merging with us.

Speaker 2:          01:14:18       It's merging us with each other. Part of what that's doing is dissolving the boundary between you and me and everyone on the planet right now because this thing is getting transmitted at God knows how many people at this point I see the awards on your table. It's getting transmitted to a shit ton of people right now and that's a form of merging, auditory, merging and obviously the next step is going to be a emerging of consciousness through something that scans brain waves and induces similar emotional states and other people. That's going to happen, man, and that's another form of merging. And then the next step from that is recognizing or figuring out a way to feel what it's like to no longer have a body yet still have consciousness. And then that's another form of merging. That's what we really are, and somehow the thing you're hopeful appraisal of the situation and military technologies that somehow through this stuff it's going to usher us or push us over the boundary from being an idea to being a week.

Speaker 3:          01:15:16       Well, maybe that's what never gets taken to consideration where things like the drake equation that there is no space travel because nobody ever bothers. Once you get to a certain point in time, you go, oh, I get it. We can create our own reality. Like you can get to a point where virtual reality and regular reality, not, uh, not only the indistinguishable but they're interchangeable.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       Yeah. You can just experience everything at once.

Speaker 3:          01:15:39       Well, you can your regular life, like whatever you deem your regular life could still exist along with a complete virtual reality of your choosing and you could choose to go back and forth to both places. I mean the idea that you have one or the other, like, no, we could still keep fucking and going into virtual realities that are. You were, you were living in Avatar. You're flying around in a fucking dragon and it's just as real as this life just take. It's going to take some time.

Speaker 2:          01:16:06       It is this life. I mean, that's the thing. It is this life based on the notion of that we are one consciousness experiencing these. We always end up talking about this, but God dammit that is it. Like we're snorkeling right now. We're snorkeling through a technique. I think Terence Mckenna, I compare this to as technological reef or something. It's an incredible essay. I don't know where it came from, but it's like technology's extruding from time and space and we're beings that live. They are like fish swimming through this technological reef. Will you this

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       awesome idea of the attractor. Mckenna had this idea that we were being pulled toward some ultimate attractor, you know, and the strange attractor at the end of time. Yeah, and the our innovation and novelty and all these different historical events, everything was leading towards this attractor, which is such a bizarre way to look at things but so unique like you, you hear that and you go, Ooh, there's a thing that wants us to build it and it's pulling us through time, you know, but it could also just be we want to survive and to survive you compete. In order to compete, you have to innovate, you have to worry about your enemies. You have to keep going so you can get your common to more monkeys and make more monkeys that are like you not like them. Those Fox does Fox and then you just make it better jets and better missiles. It better this, better that, and then eventually you figure out, oh, I could just do this, man, there's no more war. Dead violence, sadness, just bliss. Just blessed man and computer maintenance.

Speaker 2:          01:17:38       Pray in my life that I never seriously say I've got to get my common tomorrow.

Speaker 6:          01:17:44       Geez,

Speaker 3:          01:17:48       do you have any more monkeys? Because that's how you accelerate the process. Because if we still lived in Eden and it was just, you know, our friends, there's like 20 of us. Would we ever even invent boats? Okay. If we lived in this perfect place and there was fruit everywhere, we have an infinite number of animals to choose to eat in the infinite number of fish. When we're going to win, there's only 20 of us. What are we going to invent? What are we going to do? We're not inventing shit, man. We're going to have a good time. We're going to sit by the campfire and laugh. We're going to smoke weed because no one's going to lock us up in jail for having a plant that makes you happy. We're going to. We're going to have no conflict, man. We're going to have zero.

Speaker 3:          01:18:25       It was just our friends and we all lived on this unbelievably cool place where there's food everywhere. What would we ever argue about? What would we ever invent? Nothing and nothing. We would get together if we had an infinite number of food. It was just us, just our friends. We had an infinite number of food and we're healthy and we're in a place together. We would just be laughing. That's what we'd do. We'd never get anything done. We wouldn't worry about Ari. Ari fucking acting kind of weird math. Did you take over the kingdom now? You'd be like, ah. Did you see Ra rape that penguin here, man, I'm starting to worry about Diaz. He might be forming a new political party. Well, you know, Diaz. Really good points. I think I'm going to join dss to merge with ts and just have one super party. Why fuck around and give them choices. Will be pulled. Both be co presidents. I've co headlined. I'll speak up

Speaker 6:          01:19:23       president. I love that. Well, I'm not

Speaker 3:          01:19:26       the vice president of the feature act just here two. I'm opening up for the president for the first two years of his presidency. I'm here to warm the crowd up,

Speaker 2:          01:19:34       man. That's cool. Well, yeah. I don't know, man. I, I do think that there's something to be said for, for turbulence being a kind of like the, you know, it's the, creates the friction that generates the heat necessary to fuel whatever this strange technological life form is that we're weaving out of nothingness. So in that way I think it's a great thing and I think that probably as long as you're on a gravity well and a planet which we all are, regardless of the resources around you, you're still going to get in fights. There's still going to be turbulence because there's too many of us. It's because we think that we our eyes instead of recognizing that we are one organism, that's

Speaker 3:          01:20:12       it isn't because Rdq seat and my fucking fruit. Okay? We as lazy dude. I went and picked the fruit. He's fucking eat it. I don't want us fish. He brings up this fish dude. He goes fishing gear, legs to go fishing. Nobody wants to fucking pick fruit. Fruit's more valuable because it wasn't made with fun. So make me fucking fucking people. Go fishing for fun, man. You can't say fishing and fruit picking is equal. Fuck you, man. You had a good time. You asshole. You brought back 10 fish. That must have been a thrill and a half. That's not the same. It's not the same. When you're out there chopping wood, you're going to give me a fish for all this wood that are chopped. Fuck you. You had a good time making that fish fishing is so god damn funny. Not that I don't know if you have to lead. It seems like the thing as Dan, but I would know it doesn't have to leave for awhile. Oh awesome. Oh, I thought I thought I thought. No, no. I'm doing Adam Carolla show today yet. I think it's like 4:30. It's alive. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Should be fun. Yeah, man.

Speaker 2:          01:21:13       Fishing is a fucking blast. I just went fishing out in the mobile bay. In Alabama. And what'd you guys fish for? We were fishing for trout I guess is what's out there right now. But you know the, we didn't catch anything man. And we are with this professional fishermen and my dad's friends with and he's like this time last year at this place was filled with boats. But because of the climate is different, the basic

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       obviously responding is that what's going on in the spring,

Speaker 2:          01:21:42       shrimp eggs end up on the marsh grass and get released and then the fish come out of the deeper ocean to eat the shrimp shrimp bags and then that's when you have the fishing booms. But it hasn't been happening and some people are a little. I mean he, you know, you want to, whenever you're fishing you want to come up with a reason for not catching a fish, you know. But some people are a little nervous because even though after that terrible bp oil spill, there was actually a boom of more fish because they stopped fishing and fish production went up or fish fish had a chance to fuck and mate without getting ripped out of the ocean by people eating them for a season or somethings there's more fish. Uh, but then now it's like, where, where are they there? There were just a shit ton of fish here at this exact same time last year. It tends to be like that. And so, you know, who knows, it's just a weather thing.

Speaker 3:          01:22:36       Sorry, could you think of any other animal that we would tolerate? Catching and killing the way we tolerate people catching and killing fish. Can you think of any other animal we would tolerate? Just got a bunch of machines like a bunch of trucks and we'll get to do is we're going to attach a net to it. We're just going to go run through the woods and this net is going to slice down trees at the bottom. Okay. And everything it captures in the net. We're just going to eat every. Now we kind of. Instead of dolphins getting caught, we've cut a couple joggers. Some fucking asshole got caught in my net geography. I'm here to catch elk. You stupid. Fuck. I wasn't looking for you. And you treat people that are so stupid. They get caught in the net the same way they treat dolphins. I mean by the time they get to and they hold, they're not dead. But you got trampled to death. Yeah. The poor bastard. He got caught up in the net right behind the lcoe kick. Kicking him in the head.

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Yeah. They'd have a name for the joggers. They calm like asphalt veal or something. Forest meet. Yeah, like yeah. What do they call it? Into the eating fruit bats and after they call it Bush meat. Oh, that's what they call it. Like anything call the monkeys. They call bushmeat. Bushmeat the least appealing name for anything. But yeah, that. Yeah, that's it is. There is a, a part of you when you're fishing that has to acknowledge the sadism that's happening there because you're using a device from the hellraiser movies to Laura thing in. It's ridiculous. But you know, and I know that ultimately we should have compassion for all beings in and wish them all a life free of violence.

Speaker 3:          01:24:17       But fish do eat other fish of course. Well that's my argument about bears. Whenever anybody was once say bears are cute and like, have you ever seen one in real life? A in the real world and be. Do you know they eat babies? Yeah. They eat their own babies. All of them. Yeah. They just eat, they eat each other. If one of them dies, they just started eating it. They don't wait awhile back. No. They start eating,

Speaker 2:          01:24:42       but don't they eat the babies because it's like there's not enough food for all the babies and it makes more sense to eat. You're young than to waste resources where everyone starves. I thought that's why they can't.

Speaker 3:          01:24:55       No. The males eat just because they like to eat babies and they like to stop the babies from breeding. Of course they don't know what they're not. They don't know what the real motivation is. There's a lot of guesses because they can't ask the bears obviously, but they are pretty pretty sure that there's a bunch of factors. One, sometimes the males will kill the bears. The cubs, because they're hungry sometimes the mail and they're easy to kill. They can just go and grab them and eat them, so they might do it because of that. They might do it sometimes because they want to bring the female back to estrus social one to fuck and Shawana have more babies so they can come because otherwise she's. She doesn't want to let the fucker. She got her babies around the darkest, darkest way. Dolphins do that. Dolphins do the same thing.

Speaker 3:          01:25:42       It's one of the reasons why female dolphins are so promiscuous. Apparently they studied dolphins. They found that that female dolphins will have sex with as many males as they can, so that way when they have babies, nobody knows whose babies who so they leave her alone, but if she has babies and their babies and you know that you never fucked her, they just killed the babies. God Damn Man. And that's dolphins. Sweetest things ever smiling, not always smiling when they're killing babies. Fucking, you know they, they did. It doesn't mean it doesn't happen every day. It doesn't happen all over the dolphin world, but it's been observed. Hey Roger, why are you smiling like that? It's not like bears though bears. It's 100 percent like the males come out. It's Steven Rinella was explained this to me and he knows a lot about bears and when I was in that bear hunting camp, they had seen a bear cub and then it was eating it and then the mother came back and finished the cup off and finish an eight. The rest of it, like it is such a fucking hard scrabble world that you cute. Can't even imagine the reality of being a bear. I got to on that note, I got to go take a leak.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       I know it is. It's fucked up. But being a fish fish don't even get the fuck fish have the same problems. Other Fish Itam, but they don't even get the fuck. In fact like there's certain fish where you buy lures that are the baby fish. There's like, like you could buy like baby, a little rapala. That's like a baby trout and fucking triathlete it cons.

Speaker 1:          01:27:16       Find out who that a musician was that you asked earlier. Was named Pat Reagan. Who is Patty Reagan on twitter? Yeah. That dude is fucking awesome. I don't want to say anymore. I don't want to give anybody a give the premise or give the uh, the hilarity of a song, but we were fucking clapping hard. That was so good. Yeah. It's really me and Tony had them on kill Tony. It's really interesting because a lot of musicians who are comics aren't really good musicians. They just know how to play a little bit of guitar and after to make it work, but he's actually a really good musician on top of it. Yeah, no doubt. Like he couldn't do like love songs and they'd be awesome. You know, when not to me, it'd be asked me you, you look a love song every now and then it's right

Speaker 3:          01:28:00       in the arms of the angels. That's

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       really rude that they do that. What we were talking about earlier on those fucking those humane society videos. That's. That fucks with your head man. Totally. By the way, the new grand theft auto came out and saw you tweeting about it. You fucking savage and there's pod and it now where if you take, if you take, if you take a god thing, you turn into a chicken but don't play it. Well, we could play it on this right here. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So you take it. You can play it like that. Yeah, you could do that. Oh, what I'm looking at that one. Same thing. Put it up that way. Let's take over that. Anyways. It will. You can white, but yeah, you just turned. He just a pod and he just turned into a chicken

Speaker 3:          01:28:48       on it. That the pod. Does it turn into a chicken though? Why don't they just call it something different? Oh Wow. This is bad ass.

Speaker 1:          01:28:56       Wait, this is a video game. We probably won't get pulled over a video game. You're not playing this are you? Don't play this now. This is a video game. Do

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       you want to get credit for it? I don't know that. Do you know that to Brian pulled that. I thought you weren't playing. I thought only we were watching it, but it's not full screen and it's just a video we're getting pulled so many times. If you like, somebody doesn't want you playing their video on a another video because then you won't go to see their video. That's the idea behind it that you're taking hits from them. So like pretty much anytime you play a youtube video or any sort of nature of video or any sort of video that anybody has a copyright on, you can get pulled. This is one. I don't know what fair use. Fair use is very fucking, you know, like when you talk about fair use, like you can play some things if you're doing commentary over them. That's fair use or I don't know. I don't understand it better to avoid it. Yeah, man. Anyway, whatever. That looks awesome. I don't have time for that shit though, Dude. I can't play grand theft auto. Oh God. Fucking dragon age inquisition last night. Dude. It feels like I'm on fire right now. Just knowing that.

Speaker 4:          01:30:06       It's so good. It's so cool. I was doing the UFC this weekend and they uh, had uh, the ad for some new video game. I think it's called far cry. Yeah. Far Christ far cry four or something like that. But they were playing like in game footage of it. Well, I'll be like, this is insane. This is insane. I can't believe this is real. It's amazing. The kids get anything done. It's a fucking amazing. Kids today get anything done because I had a hard time with quake one, you know, think about the graphics in quake one and think about what the fuck we're looking at today. He's this far cry game. And these UFC games, man, sometimes I watched the, like the preview. Why when they step forward to start to fight and for a full second, I don't realize it's a game. It's a game. You know what I mean? Like I see them moving. It takes, I have to recognize like, wow, this. They look too perfect. It's too. This is too uniform in color. There's some weird shit. Oh there's a video game. But it takes like a full second before I realized that I'm watching a Goddamn game. So this is it. Yeah. This is it. So we're watching it and they can't see it. Right, right. Okay. And what if people want to Google this? What is it? Uh, it's on [inaudible] dot com. And it's. So he turns into a chicken.

Speaker 7:          01:31:23       Oh yeah, you just ate some pod. How do kids get anything done? Tech pod. You can come a chicken

Speaker 4:          01:31:39       or you pay attention to some stupid boring ass fucking homework could you, will hopefully never use in your life. This is this, this is the real one that new for xbox one. And ps four came out last night at midnight and they added a bunch of cats, new drugs. You could also turn into birds and go fly around the city

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       and poupon people when you do drugs. But a lot of drug stuff and a cat stuff. That's pretty cool. That's pretty bad ass, you know? Uh. Did I show you the alien game I have on my dk two or the oculus rift? Alien. Scared. I didn't want to try it. Have you heard of that? I've heard it gives people fucking heart attacks the alien. Yeah, that's what I've heard. I've heard, I've heard people say literally, I've got to stop saying literally. I literally have to stop saying literally have to stop saying fucking don't say stop for whatever reason it gets close to heart attack level with some people. There's people that are doing it that are worrying like, well this might actually cause a heart attack. Yeah. Everybody used put it on my ass screen when the fucking thing gets yet. It's just the rudimentary technology.

Speaker 5:          01:32:46       If you could feel it, feel that tailed fucking piercing your neck or that. Or if you have some sort of suit, you're wearing some suit and it likes, puts pressure on you in the areas where the thing's supposed to bite you. Like when it comes out and grabs you like you feel hands on your shoulders, a cube. No. How would a freak out? That would be if it. When it gets you, it pops up and just grabs your shoulders and you're wearing this suit. This suit is like finger press buttons on the shoulders and it pushes down on you and you feel it as this thing is in front of you. It's fucking crazy. Tongue comes out right before it brains you. You feel the hands on your shoulders. I bet this suit comes with like a special place where you could hang your diaper inside.

Speaker 5:          01:33:30       Kids this naturally evacuate their vows. They probably warn you to give yourself an enema before you play with it. Yeah, you will shit yourself. You're going to shoot yourself percent chance. You'll shoot yourself just probably like a, like a thick wet suit, like an armor plated wetsuit and you zip it all the way up to the top and everything that happens. You in the game, you feel it in your body. Man. I'm looking forward to the new people have been speculating about having these vr goggles on airplanes so that when you put them on you can see the outside of the plane. Like it's the inside of the plane, you know? Yeah. And also they're talking about using a kind of projector technology and planes that projects the outside of the school. I've seen that. I saw the images of that. They don't have a working plane right now.

Speaker 5:          01:34:19       Right. It just makes sense. It's actually, I mean I'm going to say this is a stupid thing for me to say because like the most technologically advanced thing that I've done recently is figured out that I could put marijuana drops into my smoothies. I realized that like I am always like, you know, railing against people, but I'm not doing. I'm playing dragon age and like drinking marijuana smoothies. But that being said, it seems easy to project outside of a plane onto the inside of a plane based on what you could even buy it. Like Brookstone, they have those projectors heavy sell fun. Yeah, that's what it looks like. We're looking at a picture of it right now and

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       it's the inside of the plane, the roof and the two sides are all like a giant screen. And so it looks like totally seamless. Like you could see the sky and they have cameras apparently on the top of these things. That project everything that's actually out there. So if a plane was beside you, you would be able to see the plane in hd, you know, if you know, that would be the best way to fuck with people. You hijack that thing and you like if you got hackers onboard, they hacked that fucking thing. And they show Ufo is everywhere and everybody starts freaking out. Like, oh my God, there's 20 flights. Are you not seeing this is fucking playing now. Oh my God. You don't see him. And everybody's freaking out. Two hundred people are screaming. Land the plane at dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. Yeah, man, she wrecks or uh, you know, it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be the act, the, what you're flying through either.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       It could be like an ace space project space out there. You feel like you're flying through space and the plane, right? You could have like an Avatar plane. We're flying through like the Avatar dimension. You've seen the fucking dragons around you as you're flying. H Like James Cameron can have his own airlines and you can have the full avatar flight experience. You imagine how fucking cool that would be. So cool. It's like a ride all the way to like New York is five and a half hours of Avatar. Monsters flying around the plane. So bad ass. So bad. I looked down. You'd see the forest everywhere you looked down it's program. Do you see like those Navi running around, jumping, swinging from ropes and shit, shooting arrows at a game component? Man, you could treat. You could be shooting them with machine guns or lazy or you're in the world immersed in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:36:43       Everybody in every seat has their own avatar and they're flying through this sky and you just look up and you know where you are. It's just an infinite screen above you. Fuck a roof. Fuck a roof. Now the whole thing's a screen. Why do you only have screens here and here and a little bit here? No, the whole thing's a screen. Well, because you know that. And what do they call it? The people who make you put your phone, someone's gonna. Ruin it. Like guaranteed. Like one of the safety people be like, there's no way we're projecting shit on that thing. These are fart tubes that make people want to kill themselves. You know, it would happen. Someone would tap into it and we'd be five hours gay porn, five hours from La to New York. Like everywhere. Everybody looks like, Oh yes, sailor, don't, don't, don't bother. Just dicks and mouths and fucking hairy dudes covered in. Come and just dudes with those. Those ear holes, nose, ear holes. Guys get those big plugs in their ear, all stretched out, feet up in the air. Hairy legs getting buttfuck put another dude and that's all you see for five hours or even worse and calm and decks and calm or even worse. The Big Bang theory, they just show the Big Bang theory the whole time. Did you

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       see

Speaker 8:          01:37:56       he actually made a commercial where they, they pranked a bunch of people with this like realistic window in the background and then they had like, just like a meteor. Right? Coming from the.

Speaker 5:          01:38:06       Oh that's awesome. So can we play that? Yeah, it's. I mean it was a commercial. So fucking cool. Yeah, that's bad. That's wild. Wow. Oh my God. Whoa. And they had. Yeah, they had the lights turned off the lights and shit. My pants. So cool. When did that happen?

Speaker 8:          01:38:30       I think it was like a year and a half ago, but lg ended up pulling it because it got so much bad attention from it.

Speaker 5:          01:38:37       Well, didn't. He will have to sign releases, bitch. Look, it's an lg TV. Fuck you man. The lucky nobody hit anybody. I want one of those. Got Mad. He got mad for real. I bet he did. Yeah. Today they gave him a check. Yeah. And then you gotta sign a release, right? Yep. Wow. Ah, yeah. It's so cool, man. How that's what we're talking about. That's exactly what we're talking about. We're talking about how the universe, our subjective experience of the universe is about to shift so radically and so many different ways. Because if, what's that new google thing, they're being so secretive about the thing where you can see an elephant your hand. They're not talking about, you know, Google Hologram. Look it up. It's called. I keep forgetting it's called magic something or uh, but it's, it's basically like some, it's an augmented reality that creates a.

Speaker 5:          01:39:30       apparently they're being so secretive about it. People can only speculate based on the patents that they've taken out. And I think there's a few images that might been released, but uh, it's some form of augmented reality where, I don't know if it's coming off of your phone. I don't know if it's coming off of a projector. What it's coming. Yeah. Magic leap. Look at that raised half a bill that see the elephant your hand. Yeah. It's in the middle to see holograms, lifelike looking holograms in real time. Yes, and I've heard, I've heard, I know someone who supposedly saw it and they just said it was the most incredible thing they'd ever seen in their life and the people who've seen it are all like, no, you don't understand. Oh my God, this is a game changer. You're going to watch people fuck in your house.

Speaker 5:          01:40:13       That's what it's going to be on your, on your bed. You're going to be watching like a little mini people. Fuck like you're the king. You're like Gulliver's travels like landed on some beach and it's filled with hot people in the fucking, but they're only like three inches tall. Crazy. It's crazy. You're going to be able to jerk off and have your own head projected onto the top of your cock. So when you come you like vomit is the dream. Do you think they'll get it to a point where when you come on the characters, the characters who recommended you come down on them? Yes, I would. I'd progress. I programmed that into the game. Like how? Because you know the new game, if you play it, you don't play games too scared. There's

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       a game shadows of Mordor, which is this super fun game that has a thing called the nemesis system, which is that if a look at this, wow, oh my god, it leaves shadows. It's a little elephant. That law that flies around your hand. A million dollars just for that. What is this though that we're seeing? Is this a real demonstration of it or is this an artistic representation? It's the website. It's just a website, but that's what it does, but I think that that. Look, it's time to bring magic back into the world. God, technology can be awesome sometimes the best thing. Mind bogglingly, awesome. Sometimes the best thing in life come from the most unexpected places. Most of us know what a world with dragons and Unicorns and elves and fairies is just a better world. That is why we're summoning the antichrist to reign forever on this planning window.

Speaker 1:          01:41:43       Back up to what they actually said though what, but right before the most. Just go ahead. Most of us know that a world with dragons and Unicorns, elves and fairies. It's just a better world. That's so it's a crazy thing to say. This is why we are using black magic. Demons ended this dementia. What would happen if we use technology to bring magic back into the world, like they're showing a kid, have a couple of kids sitting around a table in class and it looks like the number of horses are flying around in space above them and they're not wearing glasses or anything. So this must be some kind of like. It's a projection technology some, but I mean where's it coming out of? This is what's weird mean. I want to know if these are real images we're seeing. They're fucking with us. This is just like, these are just photoshop match and dude, ballerinas dancing on a little girl's bed watching it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:32       Ballerinas go back up to that. Look at that. Yeah. That's cool. A little girl's face. Could you imagine watching a little tiny man dance with swords in front of you? Doing some crazy ancient Ali Baba? Oppression. Dance. So cool. He's like four inches tall. It would be cool if they could give them a touch of some kind at least like, like if it's in your hand, you could kind of feel it using maybe moisture or something. Haptic technology by using air blasts. You can simulate stuff, but yeah, that's. Yeah, but you have to have a fan to do that. I think it's going to get to a point where they can actually like put something in your mind that makes you respond to the program so you feel sensory input. That doesn't really exist. Yeah. That way you can know what it looks like to get attacked by wolves.

Speaker 1:          01:43:19       Wizards or hiring wizard. He put on this, you put on the suit and you. You have a virtual reality scenario where you were attacked by wolves and you can literally feel them tearing you apart when you take off the suit and you're fine. How about a feeling to take a nap inside of the Jina? What if you take a nap inside a vagina, but then she enjoys it and she clamps down. You can't breathe and you have no way of telling her that she's crushing you. Like she's really enjoying it, so she keegan's you and they're like, oh, she's. Are you sure that when you get in there you're not gonna. You're gonna. Be Safe. Oh baby. Your Vagina. So soft and amazing and welcoming. When I get in there, it's going to be like magic. I want to just. Okay. You'll let me know. Okay. Just put your legs in first. We don't have a problem. We have no problem. Trust me, I'm in. I'm in. I'm good. I'm going to go all the way in, so I love you honey. I'm gonna. Try to make you come under climate side of her pussy and it feels too good and she just.

Speaker 1:          01:44:20       The last thing you see is what appears to be a skeletal hand because she's done this many times before and it looks like a hippo, a hippo mouth closing down on you. That's what it's like. She slammed just a wall of the roof of her mouth, like a giant meat press coming down on your body that is fucked. The mouth of the vagina just closes down like choking on saline, on all the fluids in there. You're just sort of like in this mucusy, all those baby pushing muscles just smush your bones. You feel that the pressure of her Posey just ripping your shoulders off their sockets. Why does it have to kill you? Maybe at like sucks you through a tunnel and shoots you into a surprise party because I think women have been getting the short end of the stick for too long and it's about time to start killing us with their pussies.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       I'm just trying to look at it from their point of view. Black widow style, you know, it is weird. What you just described was birth and reverse. Yeah. Maybe you maybe maybe the stuff they say about how we all experience trauma from being squeezed out of a pussy when we're babies and don't have any muscles at all and can't do anything. It's still residual trauma inside of us. A lot of people say that's like one of the root problems are their roots of a lot of bad trips is that we still haven't gotten over that suffocating moment of falling out of a floating ball of water where we had all the food we wanted and then squeeze through a tunnel that was so strong. It matches our head out of shape that that's a trauma and it's still encoded inside of people. It's very possible you're a baby, but you don't.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       You don't have a language, but you're a human being. You don't have a big brain. You have a little tiny ass brain, but the brain is still taking in signals. You still know where your mom is. You still feel good and getting the nipple in your mouth like you're getting a little tiny baby. There's a lot of information that's going in and we just assume they forget all the fucked up shit like the being born into the world and the cold hands of a doctor as he picks you up and it's fucking going to light on his head and just this big giant like a green alien. He's wearing the oxygen mask. This is what the alien abductions are. Some people say, no, it wasn't a big fad. Rebirthing ceremonies or something like you would get if you would there or do something where you get to be born a, you'd get another chance to overcome the ptsd that comes from being squeezed out of a pussy into this dimension.

Speaker 1:          01:47:00       I don't know, man. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know if it gets stuck in your head, but I don't know either could, but it. It seems like a very likely scenario. I mean the. The brain's functional and it's the most traumatic experience ever and you don't have any context. Do you? Don't have any language. You don't have any knowledge of why you're there. No one's explained what's going to happen. All of a sudden you're born. That's got to be unbelievably traumatic. You've been hearing this on top of that. Add circumcision. How about the slice your fucking Dick with a razor? Welcome home. What? You cut his dick. Wyatt, welcome to Earth. We're just going to keep it clean. What about soap? I didn't really ever. Everybody we're talking about soap to cut his fucking kids. Screamings Dick's on fire. Screaming. Just came out of Postdoc Dixon actually.

Speaker 1:          01:48:00       How long do they wait for the circumcised? They probably don't do it right away, but they definitely stick you with needles right away. They vaccinate you like instantly got. We're worried about the GDS fucking shove needles right into that baby's body. Started pumping chemicals. Which you ever do a homebirth fuck no. What am I living in a cave? What am I on? A fucking farm somewhere. And uh, clinics would movie about the 18 hundreds. The Fuck Outta here. Fuck it sally. I don't think she's going to make it. Try your hardest to get a water. Bucket Rosary. Every Western birth movie. It's like they act. If you get the water bucket there in time to baby, he'll survive. Fixed me a bucket of water. Yeah. I kinda bought a bucket of water, some cloths and clean cloth and water. What is that? What is the bucket of water?

Speaker 1:          01:48:47       Digit like? A baby's turned around. I'm going to go in there and he goes in. And what is farmer hands and ruins your wife's pussy shoves his gigantic gorilla like farmer hands into that pussy and spins it around. He's the only guy knows how to do it because he's done it with calves. We got a breach cab. Alrighty. Rolls his sleeves up to his elbow. Just fucking lubes the whole thing. Just launches it in there and spins around your kid fingernails. Just think what was good fucking country. Just fucking go for shit. Monkey bullshit. White disaster. This fingernail probably better invent the toilet paper yet it just took a giant farmer Dr. Crap. And your in your. In your outhouse. And he's gonna reaching into your wife's. Got a half strangle. The macy aided mountaineering baby. And then he's going to smack it to make it cry. Yeah, I'm the poor thing. It's just like what happened? What happened?

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       Why did I do is like the ultimate argument one day for a new type of birth. What if they figure out what if they go, look, we've found something out about the human psyche and although we were all created a certain way and we can't avoid it, we founded, there's considerable trauma in a less likely chance of enlightenment when you come out through a pussy and that really the best way to do it is we we do it nice and slow and we're going to send you information to your baby in a form of like a Nano Bot that delivers video and it's going to get your baby used to how it's going to be born, and it's going to slowly be. There's gonna be an opening in the top of the roof and then some loving hands are going to come in. I'm going to take you to your mother who will then be stitched up until they figured out one day they're gonna.

Speaker 3:          01:50:36       Figure out how to dissolve skin and then reapply it, right? Yeah. Not going to be stitches. It's Kinda teleports out a beam of light. Beautiful music on a nice soft pillow, vanilla scented candles. How Nice. Like calming Indian music. No, no, no singing, fucking kids not ready for that kid. Just like the tire, something sweet, something like not aggressive at all, and then they cut off the tip of it's because they got a nice and calm dunking. You're never going to get it if you don't get it now, get it now. Get it. Now imagine if they did that though, if they brought the kid into the world and this like feeling of soothing enlightenment, which is a minor dose of Mbma, just the tiniest dose of mdms while in the womb so that as the kids being born, it has no inhibitions. Kids being mean, they have a little tiny bodies.

Speaker 3:          01:51:31       It could be like it's a fucking like a pin head of Indian men, but they find out that not only is Mtma when given to babies in the womb make for a better birth for everybody, but they all become super geniuses. All those babies become the kindness. Most likely have no emotional problems. They have zero issues. It's a jumpstart to enlightenment. Just give your baby a little extra seat. Just so love that shit probably already tripping now. Really? Yeah, I think you're, I think babies are probably tripping. What the tripping on though. They're definitely not tripping on MDI.

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       No form that this is study. They, they, uh, don't know. They're separate from their mother at first. They don't understand that there's a separation. They don't. The whole idea of separation is something that comes later down the line. The idea that this is me in that to you is something that comes later down the line and that, I mean, God, if you've ever taken a, a nice dose of Lsd, the moment that goes away, that separation goes away. If you've ever had that on a psychedelic, that's surprising moment where you're like, Holy Shit, I'm everything. You just merge pure. They caught expansiveness. The clear mind that is the most ultimate, that is as great as it can get. That's pure freedom.

Speaker 3:          01:52:44       It's a pretty intense, that's for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       And it's experience that probably 80 percent of the people never have, right? At least probably more. Probably more than 80. Yeah. That's one of the real problems with the world. One of the real problems of the world is even like super intelligent people. I read a lot of different people's stuff online, people that I don't agree with at all. Super left people, super right people. I read a lot of people's stuff and one of the things that I. I'm always shocked at how angry and Shitty a lot of really smart people can be about fairly controversial or debatable issues, but they can be really angry and shitty and insulting and I know they're smart so I'm reading this and I'm like, this just screams a lack of psychedelic perspective. They're like, not everybody has a psychedelic perspective. Twenty four slash seven, but usually even if you have like a moment when you were in your car, like we were joking about that the last time you were driving, the last time we were driving together, you were driving and you like this fucking asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:53:44       Get the fuck out of my way. And then you started laughing. You're like, listen to me man. I'm always talking about peace and enlightenment. Telling US old lane a buick to go fuck herself. But we were joking and laughing around while we were doing it, but it's still. Look, man, I mean that's just natural. I mean it still comes out. I was able to catch it with you and that's what mindfulness is the training so you can catch it. At least we're after it happens. You gotta go there. I it fucking pattern again, but I know what you. I know what you mean man. It's a. Some people haven't quite realized yet that they don't have to be like that and I know I've, I've seen these fucking twitter fights between people that are supposedly super intelligent and somehow they devolve into like 10th graders. Incredible. Right? It's incredibly embarrassing.

Speaker 3:          01:54:32       Well, it's a social retardation is what it is. It's part of it. And by social retardation, I mean the most advanced social interaction that I ever get out of my life is when I get high with my friends, whether I get high with them, whether it's mushrooms or. I mean there's regular, there's all sorts of wonderful deep interaction you could have sober or not sober, but when you trip with somebody, there's some intense bond of humanity that happens when you trip with them, but when it's over and you're laughing and it's like, oh boy, like the social bond that's constructed through those moments is pretty fucking remarkable man. And if you never experienced that, I kind of feel bad. I kind of feel bad because we all go through great moments in life. It's not like a defining thing where you have to have it or you won't be complete, but it is some next level shit. Yeah. It really truly is some next level shit. And it's some shit that a good 80 percent of the people are just not going to experience.

Speaker 2:          01:55:33       I like to think that a hundred percent that people experience it because I think it's what happens when you die. And I like to believe that that death experience is one of complete merging and uh, that like wow, the steve jobs. Like, wow, you know, who I'd love to get. Hi Richard Dawkins. That's everyone's dream, man.

Speaker 3:          01:55:55       That guy is so fucking smart, but so hostile with so little time left, he's pissed. He was always. He was getting mad at these women who were mad at the scientist for wearing the shirt with the sexy ladies on it and you know, he was like saying like, that's not real feminism. The real feminists aren't. Wouldn't be mad at some ridiculous shirt.

Speaker 2:          01:56:20       Isn't that funny though, Joe? That thing like here we have one of the great moments in human history and as part of a byproduct of landing a probe on a goddamn comment and already they're reporting that they found organic matter on this comment indicating that the entire universe is being pollinated by these drifting mountains that have within them precursors to life as part of a byproduct. One of the people who, one of the magicians as far as I'm concerned, that the magician engaged in a ritual, a sorcerer that someone is being out of dust, like made the metal and the put the wires and just the right way so that it could get perfect orbit around a comment going 400 miles an hour with harpoons. That didn't work. But it had fucking harpoons there could shoot into the thing. One of these sourcer is the robe he was wearing happen to have women on it and as a byproduct instead of feminists and people who aren't feminists and atheists and theists all being like, you sir are a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          01:57:30       Got a Po box because I want to send you some cigars or cakes or anything you want. You deserve to get showered with. All of those scientists should just be getting massages for weeks. They should be getting whatever they want. They should pop her Razzi should be following them out and snapping pictures of them for what they did. But no, we're still stuck in this stupid frequency where a lot of us were like, can you fucking believe you would wear that tastes lists shirt. Oh, you don't even understand. He could wear whatever he wants. He's a scientist, but fighting instead of everyone being like, we did it. We worked together. We got a thing to land on a comet. Let's see what else we can do.

Speaker 3:          01:58:10       No, it's my favorite part of it. Watching men criticize the shirt doing. It's so purely for female Brownie points doing it so clearly. I watched a twitter fight between a guy who claims calls himself a feminist and some woman and the woman who loves pinup girls and she loves a like a rockabilly type shit, which is the girl who, by the way the shirt was invented by a girl or created put together by a girl, but there's similar patterns at one that you sent me, the link which eventually to becoming sold out.

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       It's slightly different than his, but someone informed me that they make those shirts by hand, so what could be going on is like, it's a pattern that you can buy and then they put it together and they make the shirt and this girl who's his friend bought the pattern, bought the shirt, you know, bought the cloth that has the sexy ladies on it and made her friend shirt because he loves her or I assume he loves her. He wore her shirt on TV and he was all happy and celebrate. What a sweetheart man. Well this is how you know he's a sweetheart the guy. Instead of going, fuck you. It's my shirt. You guys are crazy. Like, Hey, is there some real shit to be worried about? Do you guys not pay attention to the fact that we landed a comment, a girl keeping this shirt?

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       All right. She's my friend. I did it for her. I would say it's the equivalent of like giving someone a shout out. Okay, relax. Women like these kinds of shirts too, but some people think that like you have to take the sex and fun and comedy out of science and that a guy can have a personality and be a fucking Weirdo with a bowling shirt on. It has all the sexy women on it. I don't know who that guy is. I think he's a hero and I think he's one of the coolest guys on earth today because not only did he take part in getting that fucking thing to land on a comet, but he had the balls on the day that that thing could not have maybe failed to wear that shirt. That's true. It could have fucking not worked and they look at that guy and there was that true though.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       Do we know that? What did he, did he wear it the day that the project? That was my understanding, and I'm. I don't want to know if it's different. I'm going to stick to my version of this guy, his hero scientists. I'm fairly certain that that was the celebratory day and he knew that there was a chance. That thing might not land and he's gonna be. He's gonna become the punching bag of everyone. He's like, scientists are wearing these fucking retarded shirts, man. How are you going to land at comment? How are you going to land a probe on a comment when you're wearing these weird shirts? You know that guy put it, really put himself out there. It's true. He's a bad ass. What's his name? That's a good question. We need to find that guys name. That guy should ask Matt something. He should have his own float in the macy's Day parade scientists. I'm just going to google scientists shirt and I bet you get it right. Yeah, sure. That's definitely tailor. Yeah. That's the first thing. Matt Taylor, Dr Matt Taylor Shirt made me cry too with rage at his abusers. Feminists freak out over the scientists girly shirt, comment scientists, Matt Taylor shirt scientist was awful feminists. Freak out over scientists group. This is fucking great.

Speaker 1:          02:01:17       He's a comet scientists. Well, here's the thing, man. Pulled up some photos of some guy shirts were like, guys have like they're wearing cowboy hats. They have no shirt on. They're like the same exact kind of images and you know the shirtless and if a woman wore that, would you do anything other than laugh? Would you be like, what is this crazy shirt you got? Who would be offended? Who would see

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       if a woman was on television and she had just landed a fucking comment, landed a robot on a comment and it took 12 years to get there and she's sitting there and she has a t shirt on and it has pictures of guys blowing each other on it.

Speaker 5:          02:01:54       Who would be like this bitch, this fucking bitch? She thinks she could do that and put that in my face. Now you would just be like, it's happening. The university's waking up. We're entering into a better period of human history. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:02:09       For you personally, could never be offended by that. You would only think it's funny. I would think it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen. Who. What person wouldn't think. It's funny. I get maybe if you were with your kids and the kids like, Daddy, why is that guy sucking on the guy's penis? I didn't want to have to explain this shit so early,

Speaker 5:          02:02:26       but it's a comment. Scientists, they were weird. Close

Speaker 3:          02:02:29       comad scientists love gay guys that's there just in the house.

Speaker 5:          02:02:33       You would just be like, I don't know. I don't know kid, but they just landed a probe on a giant floating mountain that has priori pre precursors to human life on it. How about that friend? I heard you say homo. That's what I heard. I didn't hear all that other stuff. You said Homo. Homo is derogatory. Who cares what happens up in space? If we can't have freedom down here, freedom to not be abused by assholes with derogatory language use can still say home. Oh, by the way, I don't. I've never been criticized for saying homo. No one's come after me for saying Homo homos themselves. Like Justin Martin. Dale gave me a home El. Oh, he did? Yes, he did. That's cool. I don't know if he did, but he would not come. I mean, I'm just saying it now because I know it's going to be tensions. The most important that the idea another in here. What's not here in the intention. No. Oh, you're doing that content.

Speaker 3:          02:03:29       No, it's not. What's important? What's important is gender equality overall. When that becomes 100 percent across the board, then we can worry about your intention. Right now it's about controlling language. Okay. Wow.

Speaker 5:          02:03:41       It's about you not being an asshole. God. It's like the voice of all the things. It's like if all the blogs on earth formed into some monster and attack the city, that's what it would talk like if all the blogs on earth got together and became an organism, like a life force. All the tumbler. If Tumbler was a living creature,

Speaker 3:          02:04:03       it would just. It would be covered in tattoos and it would have piercings all over his face and it would just be screaming into the abyss.

Speaker 5:          02:04:10       Hey Man, have you seen that blog about etsy advice? We talked about this on the air, that ad see boyfriends like it's a blog of like boyfriends having to wear their girlfriends at close. Have you seen that? What is etsy? Etsy is a. So etsy is a craft. It's like an amp. What would you call it? Craigslist. For people who sell crafts and stuff. Yeah, it's exactly. It's like I'm going to make a bunch of socks and sell them to you. It's like a garage sale. Please look it up, man. A garage. Can you pull it up? Brian? It's so funny, but it's like I'm confused. Just watched this blog will all come clear like it's like people make crafts, like I made gloves and I'm going to sell them online or I made my own boots. So there's a blog dedicated to boyfriends having to wear the sweaters that their girlfriends made and they all looked semi miserable because they're in the.

Speaker 5:          02:04:58       Did you find it? That's Etsy, but look up. Find the blog. Oh, so it's just guys were in their girlfriends creations. You got see it. It's pretty. Why do girls create like ridiculous things and they make them were like, what do they make? These guys were sad. Etsy, boyfriends dot tumbler dot. Yeah. Check it out. No, not all blogs. Okay, stop right there. That shirt looks like what I have on. Very similar. I'm wearing if a lure a tracksuit top, and it's wonderful. Now I understand why there's fat Italian guys that sit out in front of like social clubs where these things, they're so relaxing, they're comfortable. It's like your clothes are giving you a hug. It's like inside. It's all fuzzy and shit. It's great to comfortable as fuck. Softest thing I've ever worn. And these guys are wearing these sweaters because they're posing for the girl.

Speaker 5:          02:05:50       Um, God, what is this guy doing? He's being his girlfriend obviously made some kind of like knows warmer type thing and say he has no post. Sweet God damn a wine app to summon that banner neck warmer. Geez. Okay. Does that a hat that she made and she made a Jean Jacket? Well, it's fairly interesting. Okay. It's just a bunch of guys wearing shirts. You're right. It's fine. I'm a dick. I gotta stop doing now he's summing up darkness. You know, there's, there's a, there's a, it's called and there's a Buddhist author named Sharon Salzberg, and she coined the great phrase recreational bitterness, and it's, this isn't a recreational bitterness and how damaging and dangerous is her name. Again, Sharon Salzberg, Sharon Salzberg Speller, Z, b e R, G, b e R, g Salzburg, Sharon Salzberg, recreational bitterness. She tweeted about it. That's amazing. Recreational betterness. It's uh, uh, hers, it, Joan Halifax.

Speaker 5:          02:06:59       One of them said that, I can't remember which one. There's two. There's two different Buddhist teachers, Roshi, Joan, Halifax, or we'll figure it out. But anyway, recreational bitterness, how? It's like that thing where you get around a group of people and your primary topic of conversation is what's wrong in the world. Recreational betterness. I gotTa stop doing that, man. I'm so sick of doing even little ways. You know, where you just kind of accidentally go that, that fucking idiot. Just kinda even joking, isn't it? Yeah, it's dangerous. I think. Rebecca Solnit, Salzburg, solnit. Sharon Salzburg. I got

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       here. Rebecca solnit. Now look up. She got married. I don't need your name. Salzburg sell out. Um, the cultivation of recreational business. Speaking to her allies, Rebecca Solnit, or she might've been, she must've been quoting this person. I got into 2012. We looked it up, but she might've been quoting this other person. I'm saying, I mean I didn't read into it. Whatever, either whoever created it all praise be to you. May Live for children, be fat. And point is, it's a fucking awesome quote. Recreational bitterness is some real shit. I mean, go to any comedy club. Oh my God. Talk to the guys were like on the outskirts especially that are trying to get in.

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       It's the water, it's the water they swim in and it's so sad. But it's like when you realize how it's infected your own life in the small ways, like it's the smart. And this is why mindfulness is good because you just sort of watch yourself and then the next time you find yourself bringing out some old bones to chew on with your friends and you're just saying or, or what are you referring to yourself? Or like, what is this idiot want? God is say, you know, you look at the content of your language and it and it's like, you know, if you go into the idea that the universe conforms to the way you describe it, then that is a very dangerous modality. Get in to get into because maybe you're actually coloring the world with your, with your linguistic farts. The constant degradation of this universe that you're in as a kind of habitual fun

Speaker 3:          02:09:10       will you for sure taint taint, but you. You interact with everything. You come in contact with every person. You come in contact with, every situation you find yourself in, you're in control of what kind of energy comes out of you. In that scenario and just in doing that, you talk about the ripple effect of the savages that created humanity and how it's affecting us today. Also every like good thing you do or every good interaction that you have or every great experience that you have with other people, that spreads out in a good way and the more you do that, the more those people might likely learned from that experience that that's a good thing to do. And then do it in turn to other people, right? So one of the nicest fucking compliments anybody ever gives me when I go to comedy clubs or wherever is how generous the people that come to the shows are.

Speaker 3:          02:10:00       It's because we talk about it all the time. You to have talked about it many times, leaving nice tips for people, being friendly, people sincerely letting people know that you're happy with what they've done or who they are. Or when you do that and you show like friendship. And just a real genuine, unselfish gratitude when you do that or a generosity. When you do that, you'll, you can create a whole world where other people start doing that. The people around you start doing that too. Like maybe the waitress, she gave her a $50 tip for a fucking coffee and a donut and she's

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       gonna, you know, for whatever reason gives somebody else a tip or give somebody some advice that you want our help a friend or you feel inspired to be nice. And who knows, who knows, you know, you help a friend move and you do it all cool. And selflessly, and you take your time out of your day, that friend might be a fucking mover helper for life. That might be like, dude, Dunkin fucking got up at nine in the morning, met me at my house, helped me get the rental truck, never asked for any money, you know? And, and he helped me all day. He was dedicated to help me move my fucking shit out of my apartment. I'm going to do that for everybody now. And what a great feeling it is when you're doing that, man, it's so cool and you're so good to get here.

Speaker 5:          02:11:11       It's so nice when it's effortless. And then when you practice mindfulness in the midst of that, you get to watch the parts of yourself that do. Or is it because no matter how many, maybe you're a supremely awakened being, but there you're still going to have this kind of psychic indigestion. We're in the midst of helping or something. You might notice certain selfish thoughts start emerging about wanting to get something back from it. And you can't blame yourself. You were raised in a system of exchange. You know, if you give me this, I give you this, if you hurt me this way, I hurt you that way. So there a momentum in the direction of selfishness that comes from a lifetime of conditioning and that's why if you put yourself in a situation where you're giving to someone and add mindfulness to the equation, you'll start learning a lot about yourself and see your resistance to purely being in that a complete state of just letting it go, giving it away, believing that we exist in a universe of pure abundance where there is not a limited supply, but an infinite supply and the ghost story, the echo of the savages is one of its primary components.

Speaker 5:          02:12:15       Talks about a universe where everything is limited and can go away and therefore you must constantly be on the defense when maybe the new story is one where it's like, no, we live in an infinite universe of pure abundance. And the more you surrender to that, the more selfless you become and the more you embody that by giving me that to other people, the more you summoned into this dimension of brand new paradigm that has as its nucleus love or you get James Brown, James Brown, you don't get. If you have all those other things you don't get on that, you to have some suppression. You've got to have some fucking iron will that's been developed to fight against the oppressive white man. So you get on that stage and you just show one. Everybody how shiny your shoes on your fucking spinning and splits and you live in a marginalized civilization, a marginalized culture, and you're a bad motherfucker and you want the world to know it and you get out there with your cocktail slip back. Yeah man. Tape. Both are beautiful because one, you got the flower growing out of the sidewalk or out of the concrete where it should never be. And the other one, you've got a field of flowers that are just infinitely growing under the beautiful sun. Both are incredible. They're incredible. I love them. And I think that

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       as long as that light of humanity is shining on the potential to be a flower bursting out of a sidewalk or to be a community of flowers, that's what it's all about, man. There's no feeling like that. But this fucking culture of bitterness, it's turning your back on that notion. It's eliminating. I mean you might say James Brown was a completely bitter person, but when I see James Brown and saying, yeah, I know you're not, I know you're not. I'm saying what he's doing. Even if it might be a reactionary retaliation, when you see that guy come out, especially that amazing concert where the Mick Jagger said the worst mistake of his life was following James Brown. You ever heard about that story? When you see that fucking concert, that's. I think that's love. Exploding out of that guy love amplified through cocaine perhaps, but still love cocaine is love. Is that what you're saying? I think cocaine can amplify love though. I don't like this stuff makes me depressed, but I've heard that. I've not joking. That's not a sarcastic. I like almost every job, but I can't do cocaine. It just, I don't know what it is man, but I do it and it just gives me the blues. It's really weird.

Speaker 3:          02:14:40       Um, does, did I never heard James Brown did cocaine? Did he was James Brown and the drugs. I should know that.

Speaker 2:          02:14:46       I don't know. James Brown, just assuming. And that's not fair to say. You know, why

Speaker 3:          02:14:51       looked it up? Because I don't want to be racist. Well, I don't want to be racist looking up something. Yeah. But he did drugs for a black man.

Speaker 2:          02:14:59       Well, you know, anytime somebody does something great. Most people. Like what drugs were you on?

Speaker 3:          02:15:04       James was smoking a lot of pot, but I could smell something else in there. I confronted him about it. Brown had a previous objection to PCP or angel dust and had freebased cocaine, cocaine, crack cocaine. When you're playing Croquette, you have a little coke, but he shrugged it off. I think the second I was out of there, James was smoking pot laced with other stronger drugs. Wow. This is from Mick Jagger's. James Brown biopic.

Speaker 2:          02:15:32       Yeah. Make Jagger, goddamn drugs. Did He, I mean what? It's Mick Jagger doesn't make Jack.

Speaker 3:          02:15:41       This is a woman actually said this. This is A. I'm getting the quote. It's from that article.

Speaker 2:          02:15:46       That's so funny. Mick Jagger being like, I'm pretty sure I smell drugs and James Brown's marijuana.

Speaker 3:          02:15:52       This is the Tommy Ray. Tom. I too. Yeah, Tom. I are who was hired by Jagger to be a consultant for the new film is now working with the Rolling Stones Star and his team on a two hour documentary, which will set the story over the battle over James Brown's estate. Brown was raised in a brothel by his aunt after his mother abandoned him as an infant and his abusive father refused to care for him. Holy Shit. Your prior to it was this rejection that is believed to have led him to becoming a control freak. I'm a control freak and later life. Wow. That's man.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       He always insisted on being called Mr Brown. Even by me, she smiles. It was about respect. This man. This was a man who came from nothing who dragged himself up by his bootstraps. He had talent, but he was ahead of its time. God, that motherfucker was a bad mother fucker. What are you playing up here? Why are you showing us?

Speaker 8:          02:16:49       Uh, well, on wikipedia it was saying for the majority of his career, Brown carried around a strict drug and alcohol free policy with any member in his entourage, including band members, firing people who disobeyed orders. Uh, but said however, in the 19 eighties it was alleged legit. Brown himself was using drugs after meeting and lady later marrying Andrea Rodriguez.

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       Oh. So early in his career he was drug free and then later in his life he started fucking hit it hard. And that's what makes sense. It domestic violence started. Listen, if you really want to do PCP, that's the best way to do it. What are you gonna do like a pushy people snort PCP? I'm sure they do, man. That I went through a phase of watching PCP videos that people on PCP because it looks like they're possessed by demons. Have you ever seen it? Like the emergency room videos of people on PCP? It's as close as you get to demonic possession. Like they don't know who the fuck they are, they're saying weird shit. They have to strap them down with leather straps, but it's like the exorcist man that a person on a bay, those are the stories where you know the cops shoot them nine times and they don't drop a break.

Speaker 1:          02:17:58       The handcuffs shatter their risk trying to get them off when they say like ancient Sumeria and darkness was on the. And I always tell you about my old boxing coach. Now. My old boxing coach was on pcp and go, got his finger bitten off in a street fight. His finger on his right hand was gone. His index finger that got bid it off. So he had his big toe removed and his big toe attached to where his index finger was but permanently curved so that he could still throw right hooks. Wow. So when you shake his hand, he would shake his hand. You'd get that. You would get like a hand in one thing. It would be curved. So he had the doctor fix it and sew it together. Curved because it was one of two things. Either it would have to stay straight or would it have to be curved and he went with this so he could still throw right hooks.

Speaker 1:          02:18:46       I gotta tell you man, I almost want to get my finger a place of my toe. She has to tell that story because that's what your footwork footwork. You're missing your next big toe. Your big toes gone, your big toes there, but your next big toes gone and that was the one, you know, that long freaky one. He had a long freaking one has their shit removed and that was his index finger. So he had like a short index finger. His finger, his inexperience basically like a pinky. It was basically like really close to like a pinky. What kind of life are you living where whenever you look at your thought, your toe finger, you're like, yeah, that was when I was on pcp and that street fight. I got to go teach boxing now that's, that's. So that's. There's so many bad ass is out there. I didn't end up in this incarnation. I didn't become a bad ass, but that seems fun. You know, that seems like a really cool life.

Speaker 3:          02:19:36       Tell you about this guy.

Speaker 1:          02:19:38       No, Joe, you never. Somehow you completely missed telling me that you were trained in boxing

Speaker 3:          02:19:44       PCP user who had his finger off. He was a longshoreman who is crazy. I mean still is a great guy, but he was like one of the toughest guys I've ever met in my life. Like legit, bonafide, tough guy. His name's Joe Lake. He's still a friend of mine from Boston. He was, he was an animal. Dude. This is a funny story. I was supposed to work at a nick's comedy stop was supposed to do an open mic. They're not work, you know, stopped by for the open mic night. And uh, Joe Lake tells me, he goes, oh no guy, dominic who runs the fucking place. I'll come down and watch you. So he comes and he sits in the big fucking giant Irish guy. Just murderous puncher. Just knocked people. Did you know, just tough as shit. Right. And his friend Mike, who ran the comedy club, one of those bouncers didn't show up.

Speaker 3:          02:20:32       So he asked Joe Lake, he goes, will you help me out when you wash the crowd and make sure nobody fucking steal any money or something just to get to stand back there and watch the show and I'll pay you x amount of money. He goes, AH, fuck it. I'll come see the show. So he goes and sees the show where there's a guy works for the club that doesn't know that Joe is just doing a favor for Mike. Mike Betts, who runs the place. Alright. So he yells at Joe like, why don't you fucking kicking this handle, hit this heckler out you fucking idiot. He goes, that's your fucking job. You go kick that guy out in. Joe Picks him up and slams me against walls, literally lifts them in the air and is holding him up against the wall. He goes, I don't know who the fuck you think you are talking to.

Speaker 3:          02:21:09       You talk to me like that. And you go into the hospital and then he puts them down and he just puts a finger in front of his face and he goes, okay. And he walks away and the guy is just a guy who was 150 pounds at the most. Joe's a big guy. And uh, I show up at the open mic night and Joe shows up and this guy who works the club sees Joe and turns white like a sheet. And Joe walks over to him, puts his hand on his shoulders. He's towering over this guy, puts his hands on him and he says, this is my friend over here, Joe Rogan, who's an up and comer. Very funny kid. You know, you should give him some work. And the guy's like looking at me. I never worked at club ever

Speaker 1:          02:21:50       the rest of my days. It took forever to get into that club I did for years. I did all the other clubs. I couldn't do that club. They will fuck me. I couldn't do weekends. I'm so glad that story ends like that. It's so much cooler than getting mafia it into a comedy club. Well, I won't say the name of this club, but this club was famous for paying people in cocaine. This club was run by run by people of unscrupulous connections. Allegedly. I do not know whether or not any of it was true, but I had witnessed things that would lead me to believe that it probably was true. I think I know the club you're telling me. It's like fucking candy, man.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       The guys are ready. We're good guys. It was a terrible situation. If that hadn't happened, I probably would have got along with them. Fine. And I eventually did. They had to realize that I didn't have a grudge and I do. I wasn't, but he was embarrassed, you know, that this guy now was in the club again and he couldn't do anything about it and the whole thing was a mess, you know? It was a mess and that guy always had it out for me because

Speaker 5:          02:22:51       he just thought you had brought a thug to get your way on stage. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:22:55       I'm sure that's exactly what he thought. I was fucking terrified. But when you meet guys like that, like read you, you to go, oh, there's a guy like that out there. If you ever start thinking that you know, like, oh, I'm a fucking bad ass, all my mentality is different than you know, you need to be a guy who got his finger bitten off in a fight because he was

Speaker 5:          02:23:14       pc, had his toe sewed in place of that fucking finger. So in a way that. So we can punch in a way so that you could keep punching. Exactly. If I got an a PCP street fight, if it ever happened, like somehow I don't know, my fucking neighbors mad about the laundry room or something and we get in a PCP fueled street where my neighbor bites off my finger and I'm in the hospital and they're like, we can put your toe back on. I'm not going to be like, can you just make sure you put it on a way I can keep fucking fighting?

Speaker 3:          02:23:50       Well, he was a boxer and he was a boxing coach. I met him because I was working at this, this gym. I was teaching taekwondo at this nautilus plus place in revere and there was this gym that was attached to it, like a kickboxing gym. And I took over, I was teaching the Jehan Kim Taekwondo Institute's classes other than revere, and he was a boxer that would come by and use the weights and all that stuff and we just became friends. And so we exchanged techniques. He would teach me how to box. I was teaching them how to kick. That's cool. We became friends and I was like, Oh my God, this guy's fucking crazy. He's a

Speaker 5:          02:24:23       great guy. That's cool to be a martial artist. I don't have memories like that. You know what, one day they're gonna I don't have memories like that, but that would be. Those are cool memories. This, it'd be cool memories, man. I love that. I love to be like, be able to be like, yeah, you know that my star craft coach, you know, that's as close as I've gotten to that kind of any kind of competition that's as close as I got.

Speaker 3:          02:24:47       Well, for me, it was so long ago when I feel like I'm lying when I tell the stories, like I know they're all true and that I can verify them and I'll call my friends who were there, like my good friend Steve Graham, who I'm still friends with. Um, I'll, we'll talk about the old days all the time. But when I talk about it, it seems like a lie. Like it doesn't seem like it was really happening. Like as in

Speaker 5:          02:25:05       it doesn't seem like a lie to me. No, no. I mean to me, even though it was my life. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant you think. Oh No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying in my life when I tell the story, like I know I met, I saw him again a couple of years ago. He really does some permanently curve. He's a great guy. But I mean, when I tell that story, why did I make that? I'm like, no, I didn't make that up. I really know that guy. I

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       knew a dude who's arrested when I was living in Boston because someone had killed this guy and broken virtually every bone in his body and continually injected him with cocaine to wake him up when he would black out and they kept breaking his bones probably with like a hammer or something like that. I'd probably hitting him with a sledge hammer and just breaking his body and when he would pass out from the shock that injected with cocaine and they did that over and over and over again until they eventually killed them and then they chopped them up into little pieces and this guy and I've got arrested for that and I don't know if he did it and I don't know if he didn't do it, but I know who she was. She was a scary guy. He was a scary guy that went to jail for several years.

Speaker 5:          02:26:04       What did the guy do that they were doing? I have no idea, but it was a big story. It was a big story in the news and then when I got arrested for it I was like, oh, okay. Now I shouldn't say friend training, partner guy who showed up the same gym as me. I mean we'd never didn't have more morehouse reports to Joe. That's one of the floors, fucking things I ever heard. Every time you, you finally fall into the abyss. Finally you're like, it's over. It's over. I'm passing out. You get a cocaine rush.

Speaker 3:          02:26:33       Yeah, they, they killed that guy slow. I don't know what he did. I mean, he must've done something awful or something must've gone awful. Who fucking knows? But I knew a lot of people like that. That's the weird thing about like fight gyms as you come in contact with some really scary people. Sometimes you know, people who want to learn how to defend themselves. People want to learn how to kill people.

Speaker 5:          02:26:55       People who are a training, not out of some kind of recreation or the enjoyment of a sport, but actually your training because they have to daily get into fights and torture.

Speaker 3:          02:27:06       Well, there was a guy that used to come to our gym that legitimately was a Hitman, was legitimately hitman for the, the Irish mob in Boston and he would literally ask how, how would you kill somebody in this situation? What would you do? And he was a very nice guy, like he was very quiet and very now, but he was almost like a guy who knew some exciting shit was about to happen so he could stay really calm most of the time until the exciting shit happen. So like when you would train with this guy, like I helped this guy out a little bit, we did some drills with them and showed them some stuff and he was very calm, like he would never imagine this guy was a killer. He was very calm and very relaxed and I knew sort of who he was or what he was.

Speaker 3:          02:27:47       So it was really weird showing them all this stuff, you know, I was just trying to get them to respect me and I was just trying to teach them the best I could and just ignore all that bullshit. So I don't know what you do, I don't want to know what you do. I'm just going to show you this is the best way to do this shit. And I was teaching them and fucking wind up getting arrested. He's one of them getting arrested for murder. He's in jail for like, I don't know how many years. He was a part of that whole Whitey bulger thing and all that. Whitey bulger Shit went down.

Speaker 5:          02:28:15       There's a great. Have you seen that Brad Pitt movie where he plays a Hitman? You know the one I'm talking about? That's one. James Gandolfini

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       on his last movie. Yeah, that was a killing them softly. That's it. Pretty fucking good

Speaker 2:          02:28:27       movie man. Really good. But it's sort of like it was the elections. It was Bush versus what were the elections going on in the movie? It was like. It was like throughout the entire movie on Tvs. It's playing the elections because it's trying to make this amazing comparison between the new mob. The mob have evolved or changed into a kind of corporate structure to the United States. Having also shifted to this corporate structure where there's this kind of diffusion of responsibility and Brad Pitt is sort of the embodiment of that kind of like diffusion of responsibility because the point of pride was that the way he killed people was by surprise so that they didn't know that they were getting killed and that's a feel like that makes it any better, you know, that somehow like that's like a good quality to have. But God, it was a great movie man, but was also great because it wasn't just a hit man movie.

Speaker 4:          02:29:24       I love the Gandolfini character. Oh, he was so awesome. So out of control and it was just like you saw them just ramp up the out of control. He just got more and more crazy as the movie went on. I was like, oh. It was like one of his best roles. I thought, let's just, just because you really believed he was that guy. He looked like he was so fat. He was having a hard time breathing. You tell irritable. He would be like in real life when we would fucking scream and spit would be flying out of his mouth and holding onto a drink here.

Speaker 2:          02:29:52       Nailed it, man. I didn't even know he was in the fucking movie. That was just one of those movies where a friend said it's good and I was just like laying in bed watching Netflix. It's like, God damn, this is a good movie.

Speaker 4:          02:30:01       James Gandolfini was a bad motherfucker that Tony Soprano character was the greatest, in my opinion, the greatest individual character in any show ever. Yeah, I think you're right, man. I think he was, if not the greatest. I mean it's maybe there's an equal level that they all reach at some someplace, but that was like right up there. Yeah, he was a. He was a bad ass like Kim and Rhoda, like right there. And who? Rhoda? Mary Tyler Moore's friend.

Speaker 1:          02:30:34       Weird. I thought you were talking about. I Love Lucy grace under fire and Japanese Godzilla Monster. Sounds like your dad. No. Rodin Rodin. Yeah. I was just trying to think. It was silly character. Lou Grant, him and Lou Grant. No Man wrote her character. Always creeped me out. Ricky Schroder. No, no. So we're spoons. When know the guy that was like, he's fucking podcast, Bro. Be Nice. The guy that always wear denim jackets and he used to be like the the the maintenance guy for a. was it Mary Tyler Moore or.

Speaker 4:          02:31:16       Oh, I know you're talking about God dammit. Not Schroeder. What the fuck was his name? Schrodinger's cat. No, that was the. And Shirley. Yeah, there was the guy on the show where the girl got super addicted to drugs, right? No. One day at a time. One day at a time. One day at a time. What was the dude's name? From one day at a time. One day at a time. Isn't it weird that you can like almost any sitcom from back in the day? You can move it on up to the side. You can just sing the song. You know the song to a de Luxe apartment in the sky or what's his name? The guy ever find out his name.

Speaker 5:          02:31:59       That guy is creepy. Have you seen the too many cooks thing yet?

Speaker 4:          02:32:03       No. No. I keep hearing about it. I'm scared. I'm scared. Me Too. Awesome. Pretty awesome. Scared to be too awesome and take up all my time. What was his name? I'm still trying to find it. Freddie Mercury. There was always those guys. Were you a schneider? Schneider. That was his name. Arrington Junior. Schneider. Schneider. Wow. There was always those guys that were like the guys who worked in the building. Where you lived or Carmen Ragusa. Didn't he work? Do work at the plant with Laverne and Shirley.

Speaker 5:          02:32:39       Oh my God. I forgot about

Speaker 4:          02:32:41       squeaky dude. I met Epstein from welcome back Kotter once. Now. Shit. Yeah, Epstein from. Welcome back. Kotter was on news radio. He played my brother, him and Nick Depalo and Brian Cowen. We all played brothers and he was the regulator came in with a baseball bat and beat the shit out of all of this is back when you could do that shit on TV. Can you beat people up on TV anymore? Is it allowed?

Speaker 5:          02:33:02       Yeah. What do you mean for? Yeah, you can. I think you fuck. Yeah, look at the. I guess the walking dead doesn't count as a same. Does it not count as a kid? What the fuck man, this year is so horrifically violent. Exactly the way it's supposed to be. God, that's what the comics are like. That's what it was like. That's what it is. That's exactly why the comics are so bad ass because they're at this season is finally hitting the pitch that the comics hit, which is just extraordinary violence in insane. Hopelessness. Exactly what it would be. It's so bad ass. That's why the comics were good. Yeah, and that's the only way a show really works is it? God, it has to continually ramp it up and outdo itself. It's like religion. Religion say stayed and static. It can't change because of either does that or it falls off and jumps the shark. Yeah. Those are the two. Like it goes dexter or it goes walking dead. Yeah. Oh God. Dexter's shirts. Fuck. Jumped the shark. God started off so good. Oh, so sad. I just. I just started watching an episode of Dexter on a plane and I was so saddened by what. What happened. They gave up. They gave up and phoned it in something

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       happened or they ran out of juice or someone could be some political things. Some people got involved that shouldn't have gotten involved. Like some guy, like maybe he was a producer for coach. Remember that show the fucking Sitcom from this guy. He's. Yeah. He was underrated. Waves was not a bad show. Imitating Church was fucking hilarious. On wings. Yeah, that guy was great. That guy's a great actor, man. He's a creepy actor. Like he pulls off some shit. I interviewed him once for later on NBC, you know, one of those shows later. He's a fucking great guy. Like he was really cool, like we had like a total normal conversation. Like he was like a regular dude. It's always super nice when you meet another guy. I was on a Sitcom and it was a fucking regular guy. Chris Hardwick is really nice. Like I did Chris Hardwick's podcast last night.

Speaker 4:          02:35:02       Half fucking great conversation with them. Like the longest I've ever talked to them. I've only seen him like, hey, what's up man? How you doing? What's going on? And I've listened to his podcast, but the first like real conversation, I had to sit down with them. So fucking really nice guy. Like a really nice guy. Really Smart Guy. Good worker. Fuck yeah. Yeah. How many shows is he on? He has a million show. He's on more shows than anyone's ever been on. I bet. But my point being, he's a normal dude. Like you meet him. He's totally normal. You know what I mean? Like you'd meet them. There's no. There's no weirdness. Thank God man. That's always such a depressing mind. Fuck. When you run into somebody who's got success and they're assholes because it seems to disrupt the principles you've come to understand that allows success to grow into your life, which is being sweet and generally being a giver.

Speaker 4:          02:35:51       It's such a weird thing when you. When you and it's a rare creature. Well, some people are so fucking talented that it's almost like you'll let them get away with some crazy shit. Like I've never heard James Gandolfini was an asshole. I never heard her say anything other than Nice Guy, but he was obviously completely out of control. Who's obviously doing blow and he was drinking, he was, they found his body had blown his body. I mean, look, you don't get that big unless you're just fucking going off like a rocket, you know, he was wild. He was in a Buddhist who wasn't doing yoga while I was eating Kale. He was a wild motherfucker and the only way you get a wild motherfucker like that that you can enjoy and those crazy fucking movies in that role is if he's living like that, you know, and it manifests itself in this art is art becomes this wild explosive, spit sprang yo fuck a piece of shit and just sat and read this fucking no hair and, and that's that guy. You have to, you have to be that guy to do that. And it's like, it's beautiful. They're growing again. Gandel, delphine plant. You've got a wire with coke and fucking chicken wings.

Speaker 4:          02:36:59       Got The fucking place you got to give them. I was in a, a restaurant once in little Italy before he died and not short. Not long before he died either. When he came, he came walking in and I wished I was famous enough to go say hi, you know, I wish I was like, if I was Brad Pitt I would go over and say hi

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       to James again a feet, but I don't want to be annoying man. And he probably doesn't know who the fuck I am. You probably doesn't watch the UFC or fear factor, any of that stupid shit. So I didn't want to say hi, but like anybody that I would want to say hi to. He was like right up there and then after he died I was like, shit, Shit. I said, I could've just said hi. She said Hi. You have anyone know him though? You know, it just seemed like a douchebag move to gold or someone's table. I was like, maybe if I can catch them, like if I'm leaving and he's leaving synchronicity and he's right there. Yeah. What if for whatever reason you interrupt, they're really nice bite of whatever he's eating and you trigger the heart attack and everyone from now on talks about Joe Rogan killed James Gandolfini and everyone's like, what did he say to him?

Speaker 3:          02:37:55       What did he say? Do you know? That's why I didn't yell at Buddy Hackett to know that. No, but it was screaming at me and I never raised my voice. We were on last comic standing. This dude was. I was one of the judges. Buddy Hackett was a judge in monique was a judge, so it was really funny. I won't say his name, it's really funny, but he was stealing jokes. It's just like. And I said all nice things first. I said, you performance is awesome. You're like got really, really funny and a lot of energy, but I've heard those trucks before and one of them was actually from a movie, the movie boiler room. The joke was they should put people on an island. Someone says that to a gay guy who should put your people on an island. He goes, they did. It's called Manhattan.

Speaker 3:          02:38:34       It's pretty funny. It's a good line. This guy did that in this fucking thing on tv and you have to, you have to call that out. So I tried to do it in a nice way to say nice things first and then say, but I've seen those jokes before, like, don't do that man. And I have to say that I can't just let it pop. And then monique was saying Shit like, Oh, you made it yours. You made it yours. You know, that might've been something that you've made it. And then Buddy Hackett starts yelling at me, you'll fucking what the fuck? He's screaming at me because all those catskills guys, now God rest his soul. All it's catskills guys. A lot of them, they shared material so like they didn't think about joke writing. The way we think of as joke writing, it was like, you know, you had an act.

Speaker 3:          02:39:16       You went on the road, most likely those people are never going to see you again. You go from place to place to place and if you ever get famous and put that shit on tv, on the Ed Sullivan show, that's yours. You know, he did it on the Ed Sullivan show, what are you going to do? You know, when they all would like struggle for it didn't become the art form that it is now until like the Lenny Bruce had Richard Pryor error where it became this new thing. So it's almost like what he's talking about as far as comedy and when I'm talking about comedy, is there a totally different thing he's talking about being a band for Bar Mitzvahs and do it all with all due respect, showing up in these, you know, these halls where you're going to have a music band and a guy tells jokes and then Sinatra is gonna come out and play and he, you know, it's not a comedy club and the art form was not established way. It's established now. It's, it's a different experience for them. So I'm defining his experience in a way that challenges his entire career. He's like, fuck you kid. You know he's right. He's right. You know, in his world, in the world that he evolved in, in know that cat style comedy,

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       they all used each other shit. You know, they all did that. They all would come up with jokes. They were, remember those jokes, they would write a few things down or make a few observations, do a little crowd work, but they all like, there was a really common thing for like high level guys to have joke jokes. I've heard that. It's weird that he decided to go on last comic standing. Well, you know, he so loved guy, you know, he was. Everybody was praising them and you know, he's a legend comedy ledge, but ain't screaming at you. You fucking call you and I just go. I am not yelling. But Buddy Hackett, thank God he died. He died two weeks later, dude. Uh, the most. It was like a month or something like that. I mean, it was really recent to the point where I was like, yeah, you gotta.

Speaker 4:          02:40:57       Be careful man. I'm an idiot too.
