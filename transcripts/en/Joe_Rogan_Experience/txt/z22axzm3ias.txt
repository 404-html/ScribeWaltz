Speaker 1:          00:00:00       The joe rogan experience showing by day Joe Rogan podcast by nine.

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       Austin's one of them is a drug addled shit. All the other ones in Texas. We're here about 10 miles outside of Austin, Nevada. I'm with my good friend Dan Dodi. Hello. Hello. Say Hello. Hello. We just got back from uh, we allowed to say unsuccessful until it hits the air. Yeah, I think Sylvia and six belt successful in memories and fun. We had a wonderful time chasing unsuspecting undulates with sharp pointy sticks. It did not work out. That means we're bow hunting for deer. It did not work out. Dan Dodi is a, hey, you are a fucking renaissance man, my friend. You're a, an undercover hippie on a hunting show. You're a man of a great fast, wide range of experiences and um, Dan is a work for a mediator for 65 episodes. This is my 65th episode shooting the show at. Dan's been on the podcast before with Remy Warren back when he and remy were, I'm releasing that apex predators show, which is excellent show.

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       I guess they're not doing it anymore. Uh, if you hear noise cause we're driving, we're on the road right now and uh, we're, we're passing through some fucking strange shit. We're a about 150 miles or so outside arena, I think one 70 outside of Reno, Nevada. And um, we, we just saw so much strangeness today. This is lonely country, man, lonely country. I was a lot of, what do you call it? Desert, desert rats, desert rats, all these people there, no offense if you're one of them listening to this podcast right now, I'm sure you're wonderful people. Lots of four wheelers, lots of side by sides, lots of long, weird haircuts, weird haircuts. Like they just, it gets to a certain point all man ago. Go to cut the end. They just free. No is reno is fucking metropolis compared to this. And I've always thought of Reno's being that one of those weird places I really don't want to go to.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       But um, no offense, if you're from Reno and you're listening to this, if that is is, it's a bigger state than I thought and it's, it's as empty as anything. You know what the game means? What does gaming does that mean the, so yeah, it's like how much it's amplifying the sound that's coming. So if I crank it up way high, it's probably too hot. Yeah, it's making a red. It's like, bitch, what are you doing? There's a clipping going red, that means it's too much. Or I'll leave it right there so jamie can handle this and Jamie knows how to do it. This is a new thing. I think I picked up, it's called an apogee microphone cause some people were complaining about the sound quality of my ipod or iphone recorded podcasts and someone from my message board recommended this is pretty dope.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       I like how it hooks up. Just hooks it up right to the base of your iphones. And um, this might be the future. This is really your first time. Yeah. This is the first time Dan duty. You're, you're the one who's breaking into in sounds good. So, um, we are about, we're, we were about five miles, or excuse me, five hours outside of Reno in this incredibly beautiful, desolate landscape chasing these deer that have these ears that they're there. Fuck, there's biggest Kim Kardashians ass and they fucking here everything, these animals here, everything. And Dan and I, Dan was behind me with the camera and I was, uh, being a clumsy, sneaky fuck, trying to sneak up on these things and it just didn't work out. But God damn, it was fun trying to do, we got clothes, we got some good stuff. Yeah. I got so close that it could have happened once one time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       It legitimately could have happened the time we got kind of close a few times. But one time I got inside of 30 yards and as I was crawling towards them in the bushes, I made too much noise and they'd got up and bolted. But, um, there's two deer that were in, ah, this is too many, too many details and catch it on the show. It's called meet. Either it's on sportsman channel. It's an excellent show. But, uh, this, uh, this fucking trip has been really interesting. First of all, it's nice to be off the grid for seven days. I haven't done that in awhile. God Damn, that feels good.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       When was the last time you did that? Probably last time I hung with you guys. Probably Prince of Wales Moon with that was, that was not quite a year ago. Yeah, it was miserable. I was less or more miserable than, Oh, this is way more fun. Way Better Mrs just hot. But I don't mind he, he doesn't really bug me as long as we have water. We had plenty of water. I mean you just keep your skin covered. So, you know, burst into flames. Yeah, I have, uh, I've done a lot of these mediators, but I haven't been doing them lately. The last year, and this is the first time I've been off grid and I don't know, a good long time too. And it felt amazing. The first three days just felt like a vacation. Yeah. Well it made me realize like we're so addicted to taking in information, at least I am.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       I shouldn't say wheat. I'm so addicted to checking the news and finding out what's going on in the world and we just, it's, it's a lot of times, doesn't give you a chance to use your brain and think about what you actually feel about things. Like you don't get a chance. You're just so wrapped up in it. Paying attention to all the news and all the information and all the stuff that's being fed to you constantly through the media, through social media networks, you know, all the, just everything. It's just too much. I tried to keep my phone off for four hours at a time during the days, even if I'm working. That's nice. Just try to shut and put it on airplane mode, put it away, and just step away from it as much as I can. Well, my friend Ari got it right. I can't do what he did, but what he did was he switched to a flip phone.

Speaker 2:          00:06:18       A smart, yeah. Well, sue said, enough said enough. I can't do it. I need it. I like having the phone. First of all, if I had a flip phone, it wouldn't be recording a podcast right now cause I need a fucking iphone for that. Because the first thing you do in the morning, do you wake up, you check your phone. Sometimes it shouldn't, but sometimes I did. But it is for me using it, man, you can't help it. I try not to. What I've been trying to do lately, I checked my phone to make sure nothing important is going on like a, I'll look at my text messages, make sure that they're okay. Nothing's crazy. No one, no nine one one calls or something. And then uh, then I just try to start my day. But I used to, I used to do it. I used to hit it hard for like an hour check the news, check all the bullshit, check my twitter feed, check all the lakes people post me, check what I'm supposed to be doing, check this, check that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       I don't, I try to do that anymore. Yeah, I spent a fair amount of time off the grid and in this connected like that through the past 10 years. It's, it's a weird kind of addiction because it's a, I think that's what I felt so when we got out here, it had been a long time since I'd been offered, but we got out here and it was like, Holy Shit, this is great. It's good, it's quiet. I think we're doing something weird to ourselves by constantly being connected to everything and everyone and everyone's terrified to be disconnected, terrified to take a week off of just nothing coming in, but your own thoughts, the world, the actual world that you see in front of your face, which is not what we get a lot of times I haven't, I've been talking about that a lot is that there's a real problem with getting all the bummer news from 7 billion people all over the world because you get a distorted perception of what's going on in the world because you're, you're connected to everything that's happening all the time, 24 seven, anytime, anytime anything fucked up goes down.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       You hear about it instantly and it just gives you this, this feeling that the world has fallen apart. But meanwhile, most of the time nothing is happening where most people are. It's the pre, pre iphones or pre these kinds of phones. I, I really did disconnect from, from news. I wouldn't watch news. I didn't have a TV. I do. Nick didn't do all that, but I, there's no active claim that anymore and there's no way that, I don't know how it would extract myself from that stream of information now because it's just, it is everywhere. I mean you can't, you can't open one web browser or anything without seeing anything. So I, I dunno, I have a

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       hard time with it. I really do. I don't, I don't like to know. And now I actually, lately I feel responsible. Lately I feel more responsible that I do need to know. I don't know. I think it's about managing it, man. I think that's the big thing is managing it. Don't you know, you don't have to completely disconnect yourself from the world, but just connect sometimes and you know, and, and know when you're getting too much. Like I'll go down those, you ever go down one of those youtube rabbit holes? We watch one video on big foot. I see. No, it's four hours later. He was like, what the fuck just happened? Interviewed, you've watched several people get eaten by crocodiles. And I watched this thing, the top crocodile attacks of 2016. And I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I watching this?

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       There are good ones. Oh man, really good ones. It's awful. It's just awful to support assholes. So it's a noisy, it's noisy life. It's a busy life. And to me it's almost, it's the business that I can second more than anything else. It's a constant pushing it to everything that's going on to the, whether it's for a hunter, for whatever reason of getting disconnected. That is the part that I, um, I dunno it, that, that that's what light that lights me up and makes me happy just to, just to fucking settle down. Like don't have things to do always. And always be going somewhere, always doing something. And I try to live a pretty relaxed life anyway, but I mean it seems too busy. Well, you were taken into a whole nother level this weekend. You were talking about one day one and to go to the mountain by yourself for 40 days.

Speaker 3:          00:10:38       I would, I would love to do that. Yeah, that would, I'm sure I will do it. I do a lot of meditation and then in the lineage of meditation that I do, there's a lot of a solo practice are basically solo retreat where you go either in a cabin or out of the woods or whatever you or whatever you want to do and you just, you just, you're just there by yourself doing your thing. And I have not had a chance to do that recently. I also used to, when I used to be a wilderness guide and it would run programs for people, they would always do a solo at the end of their wilderness experience to sit down in the woods all alone by themselves, four days, six days, whatever it was. Yeah, man, it's, it's a weird thing. It's not something I think that most people are drawn to.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       I don't think it's a type of thing that, that um, you know, I think it is a weird thing for people in our culture, but I think there's something massively valuable to be gained by that just self now and self experience. Just this reflection. Oh yeah, yeah. Well reflection but then also exploration I think, you know, have your own thoughts. Yeah man. And like what's actually there? Like what's really inside you? What, what, what really, you know, disconnected from all the input of information and the need to go and do stuff and the need to say stuff but just like fucking be

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       there with what's going on with, yeah. Yeah. You know, I'm a big fan of a, the isolation tank and you and I have talked about that. But uh, one of the things that's weird is when I tell people about it, they, I've had many people says to me, Oh, I don't want to be alone with my thoughts. Like, oh no. Yeah, you don't want to be alone with your thoughts. You want to know how you really feel about things and explore whether or not you're right about things are wrong or whether or not you have a bias or whether or not you have some sort of preconceived notion. You know, one of the things that I've found that a lot of people do is they have an opinion on something and then when confronted with new evidence, they do their damnest to try to defend that original opinion. Dig again. Yeah. They could do it again and they fucked themselves. You gotta be able to be flexible with your, your ideas or not you.

Speaker 3:          00:12:46       Yeah, man. Totally. And so, yeah. So the idea of like going out to mountain and being there, to me it's about, I think there's a disconnect in our culture from the actual experience and however you want to say that. Your actual physical experience that you're having in the moment, the actual emotional experience or the even even mental experience. I think that there's so much controlling us, you know, we control ourselves or other things. All the other forces control us. But the actual sitting in what's actually happening is to me the most compelling, uh, part of being alive. And I think there's a lot of ways that people go about doing that. Uh, but it is challenging and it's not, it's not something that, yeah, you're right. People, it scares the shit out. You know? Why? Because it is scary. I think it's, it's, it's intense life. Some tense, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:13:40       so you actually have to confront what life is when, when nothing else, you know, when, when you're really just thinking alone by yourself, nothing else is occupying thoughts, not a television show, not an album. You're a law. And those things are great too, but to be alone with your thoughts.

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       Totally. And I actually, and I think it extends to, to being with other people too. Like if I think there is something to be practicing, being able to be present in the experience that's happening. Right. And I think that different spiritual traditions are searching for that thing, different, all kinds of different things that people do to try to feel better and do better at life. And, um, so yeah, the practice of doing it yourself I think is one thing. And then, um, I think an even more challenging thing is sort of that sort of, uh, rodness or, or, or simplicity or even connection with somebody else presidencies even fucking harder. So I actually think it opens up with a way of living life that is a, I dunno, fascinating and really exciting.

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       Yeah. And an important point about being alone too, because when you're around other people, other people influence your thoughts, they influence what you feel, the influenced the way you react to things and to be alone. And then on top of that to be alone in nature. That's what's, that's really interesting. That's really interesting to me because that was a tornado out there. Yeah. It's like a dusty twister dust bin over the call. Went to that cross. God Damn Tornado, I better run for the hills. I think that's what hit us like, you know, before we came into Austin and we've got swiped, but I think it was one of those, we got hit by this huge Austin, Nevada, by the way, not Austin, Texas. I thought you locked doors too. I do. I like Austin, Texas. I Hate Boston, Nevada. I'm just fucking around phones. Um, but the place where we are at, um, is particularly unusual kind of nature cause it's, it's desert, but it's uh, it's got these sage plants everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:15:46       We should really smell awesome when you step on them and break them. They have this cool, you know, say he just got a great smell to it. So you have this, the sage plants all over the place in these very small shrubs, occasional trees, not that many, but mostly like these like six foot high and most shrubs. And there was a few of those trees like those cedars and there's a, and these red Mahogany, so it's, it's high desert. So high elevation desert please. Big massive basins, flat basis with, uh, pretty, uh, sharp and tall mountains. Kind of, I mean, each of these basins in the valley and up to what, what was it, 12,500 or 13,000 feet? Yeah, just above where we were hunting. We were really high up there. We were above 9,000 feet and there's a rock slides everywhere where like the, the side of the mountains are eroding and we had to climb up that shit. It's all these like chunks of rock and especially problematic when you're trying to sneak up on these fucking awesome hearing mule deer. Cause everything's like clank client. It's like, like you're stepping on broken pottery everywhere. It's just weird. It almost looks like somebody made it, you know, when you see all the, it's like somebody decided to make like a giant runway filled with broken chips of rock.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Just really, really cool. But just like an alien landscape. I've never been to uh, the, the, the high country, the desert up there before. So for me it was a, it was a first and it was also, um, it's, it's beautiful, but it's, you don't want to live there, but it's, it's cool to visit. You know, it's like one of those things I don't want to, I'll dry it is, that's my only beef with it. I think it is beautiful, but it's, it just looks like it needs a bath. But it's interesting too because it's so perfect for these deer, the deer everywhere up there and they're fucking big and fat and healthy and all they're doing is eating these sage bushes and then taking naps and running from mountain lions and shit. Cause we found some big thick ropes of shit there were filled with hair that is either a giant fucking coyote or most likely a mountain lion or maybe bear.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       That one seemed way too big to be coyote's. That's a, that's a, that was a mount lunch, right? Probably. Yeah. Woke up one more. Buy a pack of coyotes around us. Yeah. How they were fucking scream and they sounded so awesome. There was screaming. It's interesting. We only saw a deer and uh, we saw a couple of coyotes or scanning the horizon. But the landscape for people is death. If you lived out there, you'd be fucked. First of all, you never catch one of these deer. If he had a rifle, you have a really good chance because for some reason they know your bow hunting so they stay and like one 61 70 yards and just fucking stare at you. But anything you get inside of that they're like, fuck this. I'll be dear. Did you, did we get within a hundred yards of like maybe two groups, two groups?

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       The first day we got inside of 30 and I could have had a shot if it wasn't for it. We only had a tag for a buck. I should probably explain what a tag is. We're hung on public land. Do you may not know this because uh, most people don't, and I didn't until I started hunting, but we, the people of the United States of America own massive chunks of land is your land is my land. It's like that song, this land is, you know that. But it really is that it's not just in theory, it's public land and it's rare because most countries don't have what we have. We have these giant chunks of forest that you can hunt in and you could fish in and you can hike in and you can camp in. You can do all these different things, but to hunting them. Um, one thing that people don't know, especially people that are like down on hunting, is it hunting is closely regulated by wildlife agencies.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       That's manned by biologists that are working on science and data for that particular area. So in the area where we were at, it's not that easy to get a tag. So Steve Rinella, how to use his points to get me in there as well. And what points are as you put in for a tag you have to put in every year and it takes like a few years. So if you can hunt in this place, you could probably only hunt here like every three years. But there's other places like the Nevada Strip, which is on the Utah, Nevada border. That is so awesome. There's some strip that's in Nevada, I'm sorry, Arizona Strip, which is on the border of Arizona and Utah, which is the most cherished place for mule deer. Where you can only hunt. They're like once in your life. Like literally it takes like 20 plus years to get a tag like area.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       I think it's a 13 v. Yeah. So it's supposed to be the shit. So these places, um, it's not, there's not a lot of people there. Like we were like, we saw a few people while we were there that were also hunting. Uh, shout out to James Kawasaki. It gave us some, uh, some great tips. We met a really cool dude from Hawaii, James Kawasaki. We found him a hunting up there and he gave us some good tips about where to go and study. Know he's such a fucking good dude. It's cool when you meet someone like that is doing the same thing that you're doing. And then he was leaving and we were comments, be able for generous. Yeah. It wasn't a guy who was like, I'm not going to give you information, which happens. Yes. Yeah. You get people that want to hoard, hoard their honey holes.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       But he gave us all this information so it still doesn't help. That's probably why he gave us the information. She's like, but shit, he ain't get county thing. So for us, trip Nevada folk have been incredibly generous. He was doing this and we're uh, we're right behind a truck pulling a trailer, but that belongs to remy Warren and his family. And they just hooked us up. The stuff in the trailer, two trucks, it was really incredibly generous. Maybe that's the thing about Nevada, maybe it's a big empty placement. Maybe everybody's really, I joke around about, you know, that place being a drug addled Shill, but I, I've met a lot of really nice people from Nevada. I mean it's, it has a bad reputation because vegas is linked to organized crime and gambling and all the other sorted shit that comes with that. People think of it as like, you know, it was horrible sin full place, but that's just a small area of Nevada.

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       Most of my friends that I know that live around Vegas that are involved in like the MMA business there, they're fucking the nicest people in the world. And they'll tell you like in Nevada is like what's outside of the Strip. It's a great town. Like Henderson Henderson's a great town. Yeah. It's really nice place to live. It's real safe. So there's a lot of good spots in Nevada. But uh, anyway, point being we're out here, um, in, uh, you know, it just a really fascinating, interesting landscape to spend seven days but bring a lot of fucking water, that's for sure. I'm impressed that you haven't been in a landscape like this before. To me, this is what the majority of the American West looks like. It's Brown. Yeah. Flat with know bumpy mountains, all of them. Well, um, the first place that we hunted in Montana was a little like this when we're, uh, in the Missouri breaks, which is a right on the banks of the Missouri River.

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       And that's, that's how I got hooked. It's Goddamn Steve Rinella. He was a little crack dealer with this hunting stuff. He gave me the first dose for free and then he got me. But it's the same sort of feeling in the Missouri breaks is that feeling of massiveness and also that you are completely insignificant. Invisible. Yeah. The universe or the world, the natural world around you. It really doesn't give a fuck. You could fall and smash your head open on a rock and those wheel dear will bounce on by you. Like nothing happened. You know, it's uh, it's just, it's, it's amazing. It's amazing like that. I think the place it's sunk that in the most was probably Prince of Wales, so uninviting Laska one of the harshest places I've been, I don't know. It's weird though because that, that one's like heaven. Hell. Like the sun comes out, it's, you don't want to be anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       But then most of the year when it is raining, because it does need most of the year, it's, it's just, it's fucking miserable. It rained every fucking day. We were there all day and Dan Dodi was warning us before we went, Damn. I was like, fuck that place. I don't want to go back to that place. And Steve and I was like, why you say that? I love that place, please. Awesome. So I swore twice in my life I would not go back and I broke that prompt us. But it is also just amazing. Just so as far as the, the, the animals both under the water and above the water. It's just a rich rich environment. Well then it's, it's also super unusual too. Like the way it looks. It's a rain forest. It is. Well it's close. I don't think it's quite maybe parts of the island art, I'd have to look that up, but he's like, he's a shit ton now.

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       Both what it, when it was really cool about it, there's a lake at the top that's so high up that beavers don't go there, so you can drink right out of the lake. So we would take our water bottles, we just dip it in the lake. It just drink right out of the way. So this place is almost the exact opposite of that. Whereas that place is all just rain and, and lush greenery and the occasional sunshine pops through and you're like, wow, look at this place. It's shines like a green emerald. Yeah, there you go. To, would you rather get dropped off making keep here and there have to make it there. There. You'd probably make it better. You wouldn't make it here naked. Your skin would peel off. You know, there you could, you would be cold as fuck until he figured out how to start a fire, how to kill something and where it's skin.

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       Yeah. You'd have to set it up to be a large thing, right? You have to kill a bunch of squirrels to sew them together, make a Dick Holster, because a lot of shit you can, but then again, if you just take it, that means you don't even have a gun or a bow and Arrow and that's not good. Then those things are good, but I think that Prince of Wales was like the most profound of all the that experience. Like I felt it. The Missouri breaks that, that feeling of like complete Ditto, not detachment, but like it doesn't give a fuck. Then the landscape does not give a fuck it. It's just completely oblivious to your presence and it has existed in this form for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. Did you get that feeling here too? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

Speaker 3:          00:27:03       I was curious because both of those aunts, both of Missouri breaks the Alaska one word. We're, we're a non motorized, you know, so like is there any breaks? We dropped the cars off and we voted and truly, you know you call that a true wilderness experience and same thing with Prince of Wales and we got dropped off by a plane, Andy, if we needed to get out there and in a pitch, you know, we get out of there and a picture it would have been. So I was wondering if that was a little bit of the of the feeling you got. But yeah, there's a little bit more of an ominous sitting set of situations.

Speaker 2:          00:27:34       Yeah. Here we had a truck that we would drive to the top of this hill and then for the top of the hill we walked and fuck did we walk Dan Dodi and I walked up hills at Dai thousand foot elevation, some steep fucking kills two hours and hours every day. Dude, I was hurting. But it was a great cardio though. Awesome workout. So you were telling me about these wilderness trips that you take people on,

Speaker 3:          00:28:04       you like wilderness therapy. So my, my first job out of college, um, I had been living in Panama with my ex girlfriend and we were moving to Utah and I just needed a job and I didn't know what I was going to do. And so I'm going to Craig's list and we looked at salt, the area around Salt Lake City and there was a job advertisement for a wilderness guide or wilderness instructor. They called it, I didn't know this shit existed at that point. So yeah, there's, there's a huge industry and most of it's in the western United States, but their therapeutic wilderness programs, which are tied to a bunch of therapeutic boarding schools. So in the most basic sense, there's kids from generally pretty wealthy families across the country that are having trouble. Their parents don't know what to do and they'll send them away, you know, as an intervention.

Speaker 3:          00:28:54       And usually the intention just to have these kids go to a boarding school where there's a therapeutic presence also. But in order to get into those schools, those schools require a wilderness stage. So, um, so I worked for a program and went out there and, and just kind of, it was, uh, it was, uh, uh, the type of program where everything was made by hands. He got out there, you will given a half of an elk hide, you were given a knife, and then you were taught some of the basic skills. So we had to make our own backpacks out of sticks and elk hide. We would sew our own moccasins, we would do all that kind of stuff. And then all the fire that we made, we had to make my hand, you know, with a boat drill too. Whoa. So, yeah, so it was, it was this amazing, it was really life changing for me because I you, I love the outdoors.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       I love the wilderness and all that kind of stuff. And then I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, but got out to this place where there's literally walked out into the, actually, it looks a lot like this where I work. So just these massive brown dry wilderness areas and got out there in these groups of kids. Um, some of these kids would stay in these programs for 90 to 120 days. And so literally, and here's the part that I still very much don't agree with and I don't like, is that these programs would literally kidnap you out of your bed. There's companies of yelling, but yeah, man. Yeah. So there's like, you can do that for a job. You can be kind of a heavier, a tough guy that literally goes for an intervention, flies to a family's whole, takes the kid out of their bed and flies them and drop them in the middle of the wilderness.

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       And it's, it's, as you can imagine, it's traumatic man. It's, it's not like you're, how old are these kids? Usually? 14 to 19 is low. 19. That's an adult. Yeah. Well that's where it gets sketchy as far. So that's sketchy. Maybe I should say 14 to 18 and the adult too. Yeah. So they have ways to sort of override the age system at, at times. Um, yeah. So these programs are meant to sort of give the kid a chance to look at their lives, how they've been behaving, and an opportunity to just kind of like we were talking about, but reflect and sort of explore and learn. And there's, there is actually, there's a lot of good, there's a lot of good that happened. It's like it really does help people. Um, and there, in my opinion, there's a lot of bad too. I don't think you can ever imagine that you could literally kidnapped the kid out of your house and not fuck up the trust you have with.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       Yeah. It's, it's messed up. Um, yeah, but that's, so I did that for, I started there and then I started working in a more state run sort of correctional programs. So for a long time, and I lead the trips in Minnesota that were, um, it was a 21 day sentence, but it was basically an alternative to a 60 day Juvi sentence. So basically you steal a car, you could either go, the judge can either send you to Juvie for 60 days or send them to me and then we'd go on a a bad ass, like, you know, 200 mile hiking trip or something. Definitely take that over at Juvi. Oh yeah. Well, but yet big for obvious reasons. But then the other reasons too is that, um, you know, these programs are generally run by really like grounded good people that treat people well, at least the ones I always worked for.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       I worked for programs with really like exemplary leadership and you know, I think what these kids could learn and those programs as opposed to go into Juvie, you know, being in the shit holes that doors are, it was a, it was a really bad, much better option, you know? Yeah. I would imagine that's a way, way better. But just to kidnapping part is crazy because the states, they've given up on discipline their kids so much that they just say, all right, I can't, I've, I fucked up raising this kid. It's time to just electro shock therapy. Jolt them with wilderness. Totally, totally. And it's a long, slow, uncomfortable shock, like 120 days in the desert like this and this. Oh my God. So when you get these kids, so like if they're kidnapped, how many days into this kidnapping do you meet them? Well, day one.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       I mean the data right away. Yeah. So a lot of programs have kind of like a, an inbetween camps. So you come in and maybe the first two weeks, like a halfway house. Yeah, yeah. Like a wilderness halfway house, like a base camp, you know, like where you learn how to do some of the skills and maybe you start. So the other thing is is there's relationships with and therapists have these programs and that's how it works, you know? So there's the people that work with the kids directly are like what I did, which as an instructor, so it usually there'd be two of us, two adults with a group of 10 kids and it was all an all boy usually segregated into, into male and female. So I pretty much just work with dudes for a long, long, long, long time. So it's the instructors with lead the days and you'd usually hike or float or whatever you do and you know most of the day and then you would run, you call them.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       Circles are like processing things where everybody would use will really, a lot of it was came down to learning how to communicate and communicating honestly and openly as really good. Actually I learned a lot by, by being there doing it. But then once a week or twice a week, a therapist would drop in somehow magically and have therapy sessions with everybody. Huh. So a therapist, they didn't even know, well they developed a relationship with them, you know, and they'd worked with him for, you know, three to four months that they were there. So they became a pretty fluffy, you know, usually they became pretty close with the therapist too. So did that, did it stick with many of these kids have so many questions, did it stick with them? Like wait, how many of them, like that experience actually changed their life so that, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       Good, good question. And I don't think anybody has the actual hard numbers on that. Maybe some people are looking to get that and they call that recidivism. Right? Like if he ended up back in the morning are um, I know for a fact that I stay in contact with a ton of the kids that I worked with just cause you know, we've got to know each other really well and respect each other and became friends. And I know I've seen the benefit almost across the board. Like, like good things learned, a lot of growing up happened, you know, it's kind of like a forced right rite of passage in a sense. You know, the idea that forced, right? Yeah, of course. Read of passage, which I don't agree with the forest a lot of, I know a bunch of those kids I could point to 12 right now that I know just kind of turned around and maybe went to college or didn't go to college but ended up having good relationships with their family, are feeling good about life. But then there's probably far, far, I know there's far more where that didn't necessarily happen. I don't necessarily think it was a bad deal for them to go through that experience. Um, but it's, it's not, it's not a cure all, but what it does, I think it's self selects for, for people who really do kind of want to figure shit out cause it gives you a break and time to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       But yeah, no, I wish I had, I wish I had more time.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       How much resistance did you experience? Like when these kids were getting kidnapped and all of a sudden they would come to you? Like how many of them were like, fuck this, get me home please? My mom. Many. I mean, yeah, I don't know. 30 40 50% of just like either shutting down completely and not compliant with anything. I'm more, you know, direct, direct sort of resistance or amy or things like that. Most of those come around. What's up? Did they come around? Oh, totally. Yeah. There's not, there's only a couple folks, a couple of dudes I ever knew that kept it up, you know, that kind of had the, had the stamina to keep that up at some point. It was, you know, it's just sort of like accepting the fact that you were there, you know, I mean cause fuck man, they get get literally dropped in the middle of a desert and you're told you're going to be there for three months or four months at some point.

Speaker 2:          00:37:12       You either have to accept it. Well not either. I think. I think you just do just kind of, you know face reality. Well for someone who's on a fucked up path, it really might be one of the only ways to correct it, to give yourself that chance. Like we were talking about being out there in the desert, the high country and you get kind of like a little bit of a reset. Like you get to relax and be alone with your thoughts and just experience a completely different set of, of the input of a set of data than you're used to. We're used to like certain kinds of data and the input. And for a lot of these kids they used to hanging around with fuck ups and being around their asshole friends and doing stupid shit together. And they get stuck in these patterns. These grooves get cut deep and the momentum of their life and their past is incredibly difficult to escape. So that's why I was really excited to hear about this when you were telling me about it. I was like, oh that, that might work like for some people. Right. Well, so, and then you asked, so how many does it work for? One of the tougher things is that even if it does work, so say you yanked out of your home and uh, like just said, so your, your

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       home and your friends and your community has so much to do with, with how you end up interacting in what you do. So even if you get sent away for four months or even years to these programs and then you may change, we pro club, not even me, you will change your a kickboard someone will change, but then no matter how much you change it, you go back to that situation that you came from the house, your family, just the culture that you're in. God, is it hard to, uh, to, to walk, to not slip back into old patterns, but then also even just to fit in that site. So that's, that's what I've been working with kids the Way Leon is that, you know, go away and have these big experiences that they, then they go home and mom and dad are still exactly how they were. And you know, as a try to be impartial. I don't think I'm good at being impartial, but I try looking in getting to know these kids and all the things that they went through. It's so fucking hard not to point. Every finger had the family and the pen.

Speaker 2:          00:39:38       And you know, what's hard is that the parents were raised by equally fucked up. So it's almost not even their fault. No. The, the line of blame, if you want to do that, can go back and really long. So the monkeys from the trees, if you believe in that. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:52       So that's the thing about a wilderness, like a long intervention like that at that, I think that's what I meant about self select because it's possible for somebody who really wants to change stuff, you know, to change, to change the momentum of your family, to change the momentum of your past. It takes a lot of energy to do it. It takes like a lot of dedication, a lot of letting go of a bunch of stuff. But it really is a pretty amazing thing to, to be a part of. And that kind of experience does facilitate that sort of thing if one

Speaker 2:          00:40:22       wants to. But then like I said, once you get home, it doesn't give you, it's not like it gets easier. But yeah, you certainly can grow a lot and you can change a lot. It's almost like we need that for parents too. Yeah, man. Yeah, totally. I agree. I mean, parenting is a very bizarre, it's sort of a, it's incredibly complicated, very difficult to do. And it's an unbelievably, she neutra responsibility to be in charge of the, the really the future of a life and all the people that life is going to touch. So if you're using your son is you want to grow up and all the things that you teach him and all the experiences that he has with you will reflect on how he interacts with other people. And that ripple effect carries on to thousands and millions of people potentially. It's, it's incredibly, it's so much responsibility and it's incredibly difficult to do correctly. And there's no fucking, there's no requirements. Anybody could do it. I mean, it's like one of the most important things in the world is to raise a person that's to affect other people in a positive way and

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       so fucking hard to do. So hard to do and yet so easy to be in that position. All you have to do is fuck it. Everybody fucks. No, I can't stop thinking about it. My, you know, my boy was born two months ago. My first kid and um, I feel all of a sudden saddled with this responsibility, not, it actually just go, it's going bond beyond him. I feel like. Yeah. I just think I feel so much less of a narcissist than I ever have that just that it's not about me and I need to clean my shit up. I need to, you know, get my act together. It should give him a as good as an example if I possibly can. You know, I think that, and I don't know, you know, I'm a very new dad. I don't know this, but I think one of the best things we could do as a people, as a culture is for, yeah, Pete, for parents who are put in that position with all that responsibility to somehow look at themselves real hard and take that time to, I don't know the best way to put it, but just improve themselves rather than trying to figure out how to parent a certain way or parent better.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       I really think the best thing we could do is just be better people, would be better humans ourselves.

Speaker 2:          00:42:56       That's a very good point. That's very quick point. Lead by example. You know, that was uh, when I used to teach taekwondo, one of the, um, the things that they would call you, the term that the Koreans uses sub ohm Nim and there was one who leads by example. That was the, the idea behind it behind being an instructor and to be a parent that leads by example. I mean, how, or sometimes some people learn a lot from parents being a fuck up. Totally. I know a lot of people's parents were fucking losers and they're just go get them totally. They just get shit done. And they, their hustle because their parents were drug addicts or alcoholics or jailbirds or whatever the fuck it was. And they just felt the pain of their family being awful. Totally. But that's not a good bet. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       I mean that's third from experience or learning by example too. You know, he can either accept in love with you what's your parents do or rejected or you know, something in the middle. I don't know. But so the eye, that's what I learned. So I worked with, with young guys between the ages of 14 and that toward the end of when I did that work, I would do more specialty work. So I do like one on ones to one time I did a 55 day wilderness trip with one kid, just him and I, that was tire thing. But what I low was that like 55 days was one kid. So he was amazing. So it was fucking fantastic. It was amazing. He loved to work out. So, um, he was, he was a good kid, man. He was like 19 or 20 and just not sure about college, not sure what to do.

Speaker 3:          00:44:38       Uh, did they kidnap him? He knew he was coming because he was an adult. He's legally an adult. Right. Um, and the first day he showed up and I remember he said, you know what, I'm going to pretend like I'm going to be here until I die. He had this really interesting perspective. He's like, I, he's like, I know this is going to be long. It's going to suck. So I'm just going to sort of, you know, just not count days. I'm not going to like count my time or whatever. But he was awesome. So he was really into lifting weights and stuff. And I was at the time and uh, so we would do pushups one day we did, I think we height like 14 miles in 1400 pushups or something like that. Like try to blow shoulders up. It was so fun. But when I was going to say is that what I learned from working with kids so much is that example thing is there's, there's nothing to compare to that as far as what people are, kids are good guys especially will respond to, is that example like you can, you can tell them, I mean, kids, they catch bullshit the fucking second it comes out of your mouth.

Speaker 3:          00:45:43       You know, if you're saying one thing, but you're not living in being honest. If you're not being real about yourself, it doesn't, it doesn't work. So, I mean, I think that that was a real, you know, and I did this for five or six years and I've spent probably six, 700 days out doing this. And I came back from the experience just seeing this, this huge gap in our culture about role models and mentors and just, just regular relationships that seem pretty natural and pretty normal. Um, that just like I would get into a group of these kids and you would just, um, there'd be something there. They would recognize something in me and I'd recognize something in them and it just a really cool thing to be a part of, you know. Um, what did you guys do for 55 days in the woods?

Speaker 3:          00:46:34       I leave that, so we would hike a lot most of the day, right? We would hike probably eight to 15 week camping, backpacking, backpack up on the shores of Lake Superior. So there's a, it's called the superior hiking trail. It's a 200 plus mile footpath that goes into the hills and mountains, like over lake superior. So yeah, man, we would hike. We'd swim in the lake. Um, at that point in time I had this idea that I was going to ask my girlfriend to marry her. So I was looking for, there's a, gets these little jewels, stones and all the rivers. So we'd spend a lot of time looking for stones and I don't know man, just hey, you know, you know, really and push ups and push ups, push ups. Wow. And so a lot of conversations about the future, about life, about yeah. How to change your path. Yeah. Yeah. Some of that. Um, and then a lot of times have a lot of silence, man. You know, we weren't going to talk what, 16 hours a day, it just be too much. But yeah, he ended up doing great man. I think, I think he's off kind of killing it in life right now.

Speaker 3:          00:47:43       But that's an extreme, you know, that's an extreme example. So now how is this organized? So it was, his parents were like, hey, fuck up time to put you in the woods. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. So they had heard about it and they, they just felt like that would be a chance for him to break his pattern. Sure, exactly. It's interesting, like there's, there was a generally, uh, like different categories of, of kids who would come to these places. So there you'd have your, um, drug abuser sorta out of control kid. You'd have your internet addicted, um, slightly softer guy, you know, that socially awkward. Sometimes we hit an emotional health outbreaks. Um, they kind of broke, you know, into categories tends, but, but honestly, but the thing is, is the cool thing about spending that much time with people is that, you know, like he doesn't take long to see through those behaviors to really seem like a good kid.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       And Pretty, I've worked with hundreds if not thousands of kids and maybe one, one, I can only think of one that I don't think was like somebody that went and we'd go have a beer with or hang out with today. You know, like the good kids, they're really good. They're great human beings. I just, um, either shitty circumstances are made a lot of bad decisions or just were confused or, I mean whatever, you know, I think I could have ended up there easy if I would've gotten busted in high school for budgets, you know, drinking and partying I, well, especially if you were born into the household that they were born into. And that's one of the big things obviously about life is that you can't pick your parents, you know, and you can't pick your neighborhood that you grew up in. You can't, you know, you don't have a say until you were an adult.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       Yeah. That's, we were talking about yesterday, the, so after I did the wilderness stuff, I went and, um, I became a high school teacher in the Bronx. I was part of the New York City teaching fellowship programs. So basically we give you a free master's if you teach for a couple of years in high need areas. So it was an English teacher and it's really cool to school in the southeast Bronx for a couple of years. And, um, you know, just that was the most challenging and probably rewarding thing that I've ever done and really, so a lot of the positions, so first I worked with mostly wealthy kids at some of these private pay wilderness programs event. I did a lot of stuff for correctional stuff. So that was rural poor, you know, that was a lot of um, you know, kids from reservations and just sort of, no offense but white trash type kids.

Speaker 3:          00:50:26       And then I moved to the inner city and worked there. And so I got a, I got a good spectrum on, on working with different kids. Really just ended up that I kind of liked them all. You know, there's fucking people, human beings while you were saying, yeah, you can't pick where your, where your front man and you can argue how big of a difference that makes giant. It's almost everything in terms of your future, you know, and so many people don't realize that as well. It's a lot of times the really fortunate ones don't realize it because they just think that everybody's got it like this or they just take that, well, my life's hard to, you know, my life was, uh, only challenging. And then we moved around a lot. Like my mom, my Stepdad were really nice. People got lucky, you know, they weren't fuck ups, they weren't assholes.

Speaker 3:          00:51:18       They didn't know. They didn't beat me and torture me is here. Such a horrible, horrible stories of what parents do to their children. And you know, you got to wonder what their parents did to them that started this whole path. It's almost like unstopped before some momentum, but some of the things you were telling me about the, the, the poor kids that you worked with, like yeah. And so one of the kids that just this amazing light field kid, um, you know, co comes, how did, I don't remember how it happened. I think, I think he came into school one morning and uh, you know, his dad had, had bashed his skull in with a, with a baseball bat. Just just, I think he got drunk and got angry. He just beat the fuck on, you know, I remember that morning feeling just so hopeless and just like, you know, nothing I could do to protect this kid.

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       Like I could be the best teacher, I can be the best role model and friend of this guy then than I ever could be. But every night he has to go back into this unimaginable, horrible place, you know? And it's insidious. There's a lot of weird ways it comes out to it and it's another student of mine of mine, a hug a girl. Her mom would basically tell her that she was always sick and there's a name for this. There's like a condition. I remember where a parent needs their kids to be around so much for their own wellbeing. Somehow they turned them into a hypochondriac. Yeah, it'd be heard of this. No. Yeah, there's a name for it.

Speaker 3:          00:52:58       I can't remember it right now, but weird shit man. Just, just weird stuff. And, you know, I think there's so many people that are working so hard to do good things for people in, in the harder circumstances. And, uh, it's, it's like an overwhelming force. It's so hard. And I, but here's the thing I've seen in like, uh, I seen a bunch of those kids that I taught and so I taught in a school, I was their only teachers. It's of like a kindergarten model for high school. Right. And all the learning was based on projects they did and they had internships. So they didn't go from math to English to science and all that. We just worked one on one and they tried, you know, kind of worked out everything at all times. And uh, so, you know, they were my students for two entire years. And, um, the amount of time we spent together was just really intense. And Man, we got very close. Um, I'm losing my train of thought. But yeah, so there's a lot of people trying to do good things, but it is that home life or that cultural pole trajectory. Um, I dunno. I Dunno what the, I don't know how to combat it.

Speaker 4:          00:54:11       Well, one of those, Pat, I'm one of those, um, programs like the one that you were involved in. It might be one of the only ways to do it. Yeah. Or a program like that. Something that's going to give them individualized attention and let them know, hey, there might be a light at the end of this tunnel and it might be a way out of this. There's nice people out there like Dan Dodi that are going to help you out. And he recognizes that there's people out there that need help,

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       but they're filled with that shoe. And everyday too, man, you know, they're told that by, by tea. And you know, it's, it is interesting because I'm this, I was born in North Dakota. I'm about as white as you could ever be. And My, my students who act, so I mean, just for facts. So like the school, um, I work at the bronx completely segregated and it was completely black and Latino, uh, with Mexican and Dominican and Puerto Rican and black and not a single white kid in the entire school. Like it's just not that way. And so there's immediately this odd dynamic for me to go and teach in a, in a location like that, that there is a racial dynamic present no matter, no matter what. Like my kids would tease me about how when I was on a time, you know, it was great. I mean we, we got past any racial barriers or at least most racial barriers, you know, we were able just to see each other as human beings and him worked together that way. But so there is a lot of, they get what you just said. They get a lot of people tell him that all the time, but there's a light at the end of the tunnel. There's, there's options, you know, you can, you can take ahold of his life, but just his words.

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       Two kids. Yeah, just lip service, you know, and they hear that before. Like you gotta get good grades or You got to go to college and get a good job to hear all these things,

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       things that don't seem to resonate. No, because it's disconnected from the experience of life. Right. So I can go in there and say that, and I went to college and I had a good safe childhood and then in a safe place and I can see that it doesn't fucking mean anything because they go home and it's not safe. It's just not. And I think that's what it comes down to more than anything. It's people are in a state of fight or flight constantly because it's, it's really, it's a safety thing. It's, yeah. Yeah. I mean it's like

Speaker 4:          00:56:21       everyone rinella was talking a those deer

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       today. He was like a, the deer, a Jack Rabbit runs in front of the deer and the deer leaps up. Like someone hit it with an electric shock. Yeah. Like they're constantly on there, constantly on guard. They, and that happens also with children and yeah. You know, I have talked to him this before. I had a feral cat and that fucking cat was wild to the day he died. I had him when he was a baby. I got the money. He's a kid and he was only a couple months old, but he was already, it was already too late. He was fucking wild. He was just in his mind, everything was out to get them. Yeah. I mean, I can't officially say this cause I haven't studied it officially, but I think that there are no versions, if you call it ps Pete, I'm sorry, ptsd or just stuck in the state of hypervigilance, whatever news.

Speaker 2:          00:57:15       It's just coming from a place that's not safe. A place that's fucked up and to be expected to, to be able to overcome that without any real time assistance and work. He's really unreasonable. I think it's just, it's, it's really not like, you can't just decide right to quick cause it's your body. It's semantic. You know? It's like, it's either you get to pay to you. I mean, maybe it's your mind. Maybe it's your mind. Maybe it's both, but it's, it's not like you can just say, okay, I'm gonna, I don't want to do this anymore. It's far more, it's far more complicated. Yeah. It's a, it's a battleship that's moving a hundred miles an hour and you're expected to turn on a dime. It's not going to, it's just a lot of weight momentum behind that passed. I was talking to Michael Irvin once, I was on a flight with them, just random and uh, it was all the way to Australia, so it's a long ass time.

Speaker 2:          00:58:10       And he and I were talking about a work that he's been doing with, uh, some young kids come from troubled houses and troubled backgrounds as well. And he was telling me that when a child is in the womb and the mother is experiencing intense stress from violence, from crime, bad neighborhoods that kind of shed a domestic abuse, that kind of thing, that the child grows up with more of a propensity for violence like that, that violence becomes like almost in their DNA as a response to any perceived threat, whether it's real or not. And that the, we have to understand that these children, like they're being wired for violence, they're wired to deal with bad neighborhoods, bad situations, crime, and it's, it's literally a part of their genetics. It's in them, it's their DNA almost. Or it is so this the republican white conservative idea that people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, which is like, you know the Cliche, right? They to get their shit together like God. Is it more complicated than that?

Speaker 3:          00:59:25       It is man. But so here's the, here's the interesting thing is I applied, do think that I actually agree with that in a different way. I think that you can never expect anybody else to do any of that. Like the way it is. You're born and raised in the way you are and then at some point you fully have to take responsibility for that. You know, no matter how shitty or great in your childhood was, no matter what you're dealing with, I think that that there is no one else that's going to do it for you. So you, I really do think that there's a, there is a piece of truth in what they're saying. I just don't think that um, that general mindset is nuanced or understanding enough of what people are working with that they're unrealistic about. Yeah. I, yeah, they might just be like, well,

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       what's conveniently aloof? You know, they're conveniently ignorant about the circumstances that are involved in creating a child that grows up and has been in juvenile detention since they were a little kid and has been in and out of all sorts of police custody and been in crime situations from the time they were young to say that you need to just straighten your act up. Like they don't have any examples and the examples that they see on tv might as well be them watching iron man. It's, you know, it just doesn't seem real. It's not real.

Speaker 3:          01:00:49       No. And that's, that's an issue I have with that whole debate or political discussion or however you want to put it. Is that it to be, it's only up there talking about a situation and never as the actual conversation being had a conversation between people who had actually affects is rarely brought out and it's just a bunch of people looking at things from the outside and commenting and talking about it and not actually digging into it. And it's just doesn't really, it doesn't serve anybody. I don't feel like it serves anyone.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       Yeah. And it's also like very dismissive. He was very dismissive of other people's misfortune and not really appreciating or understanding your fortune, you know, we're all born to come totally different circumstances for the most part. And most of us here in America, we were talking about this yesterday, that people that are in this country are so much more fortunate than someone who's born in some, you know, terrible third world situation. Like we were talking about Liberia. Yeah. The reality of Liberia, which is former, uh, prison or not prison, college slave colony with what they did was they took American slaves that were released and they shipped them back to Africa literally and created this horrible, horrible environment through, you know, a bunch of different factors, but several war being a big one of them. And vice has a really insightful and amazing piece on, uh, Liberia.

Speaker 2:          01:02:24       I think it's vice guide to travel. All my God, it's an awful, but you know, you can't say that, you know, being born to a blue collar, white family in Cleveland is anything remotely as bad as being a child born in Liberia or he can. So, and then looking at that person though, the, the child who's born in Cleveland, you know, there's, I'm sure there's a lot of kids that are born there that wish, fuck, you know, why couldn't I have been born in New York City? Or Fuck, why couldn't I have been, you know, it's, it's just, again, it comes back to what you were saying about being a dad and the responsibility of being a good person and being a better person is that making and developing human beings and creating a community together with each human beings is so incredibly difficult and were handed this responsibility with no instruction manual.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       No, that's the thing. No good leadership. No instructions. No, you're right man. Well

Speaker 2:          01:03:31       leadership guys like you or some other folks out there that are doing similar things that you can find, you know, but man, if you don't find them, fuck

Speaker 3:          01:03:40       yeah. One, one thing I think it's really important that you're kind of hitting not there or we're saying is there's like a big leap to go from the place of, of blaming others and just feeling like all my shitty, like look at my book, what I was eating and it was really shitty. It's a big leap to go beyond that and accept it. First of all, no matter what it is, what you got going on in your life and then even a bigger leap. I think to start taking responsibility for both yourself and other people. You know, I think, yeah, I think that's what is, not that it's missing because it's out there, but I just think it could be like we got time in our lives, you know, like we're doing okay in general in this country. I think we could take more time for each other in that way. Just across the board today, whether that's in our schools or whatever it is. I don't know. I don't have any answers.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       You have some answers. I think you've got some great ideas, but I think one of the things that we talked about yesterday was the amount of children that you had communicated with you had taught that found themselves in some horrific situations that you had to kind of experience with them. And I think that human beings today, at some point in time, we have to realize that we are some sort of a super organism. We are all connected. And if this kid who grows up in this horrible environment and is just a abused

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       and subject to all sorts of violence and that kids can go perpetuate more of the same, if no one steps in, if no one offers some solid example that you can do better, like some, some sort of just some pathway through the bullshit and bullshit is not strong enough worth.

Speaker 3:          01:05:39       Yeah, and for me like so I've spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about studying sort of both, both rites of passage at different parts of the world, but then also just this really simple concept of mentoring or mentorship or role models. And I think I got real lucky like I had an eye. Not only did I have a good family and good parents, like amazing parents. I had, I have this like string of role models that I had from little kids. So we've talked about this briefly before, but my first one was my taekwondo instructor at Russ kid best or Mike, you know, like he was just, I was super shy, super like very soft as a kid. And then this dude in a sports car drove into Drayton, North Dakota. And I started taking taekwondo with him and, and he was just this, you know, bad ass, brash, strong, confident guy.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       And then I looked up to him like I, I attribute a lot of my, um, the quality of the good qualities I value about myself, both to him and to taekwondo itself. Cause it, it teaches them how to get teachers great things to kids. And so he was a mentor. And then in high school I had this, this farmer and worked on a pig farms and he was John Weirs and we didn't talk about shit, we didn't lie, he didn't like fill me full of wisdom. What we did was just worked again the work side by side and we shoveled pink shit and dumped it on the field over and over and over. And I went to college, I had this great mentor who sort of, you know, nonchalantly took me under his wing and kind of on and on throw my life, man. And I, I dunno, I've, I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and I really, I just really wish that for, for people or want that for people, you know, cause cause you can't rely on your parents. You have everything you need in this life. It's just, it's too much pressure for,

Speaker 4:          01:07:25       well also I think, well as we were talking about earlier, their parents didn't know what the fuck they were doing and their parents pass didn't know what the fuck they're doing. And for a lot of us that's, you know, that's the reality that we find ourselves being born into. But I think with doing with some of the things that you've done and now also with the amount of data and information that's available today, I think we have a chance of affecting our society and our culture and the way we communicate with each other and just, just who we are as a, as a species. This, this crazy, weird super organism of human beings. We are, we're in a better position to change that. And then then ever before, like my grandparents came over from Italy and Ireland on a fucking boat. Nobody knew what the hell was going on.

Speaker 4:          01:08:17       Their parents didn't know shit and they brought him over here. They just heard there was a better chance. There's a, there was an opportunity, I mean they might've saw a photo of what New York looked like, you know, they might have and they took a chance and they came over here. That the difference between them and what the kind of experience and the kind of access to information that your children are going to have, where my children are going to have. It's fucking profound. You know? And I think we're at, we're a part of something that's really interesting right now and that the human race is becoming hyper aware of all the variables that are fucking it up. And one of the big ones of course, is the abuse and mishandling and miss raising of children.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       Yeah, man. So yeah, to that point, there's this been, this thing that I've been paying attention to that I think is happening. So as we have more information and it, as things happen faster, it has all of this compounds and things go faster, faster, faster. I think that the impact of slowing down becomes very, very valuable very, very quickly. So, you know, we're talking about all these wilderness experiences. I also bring up like meditation or any of these things. I think that as other things speed up, I think that those are these things like have the power to just smack you across your face and like change six fast. You know, I, and I don't know if this has just been our observation for 10 years or so, but I think that, uh, you know, 150 years ago or whatever in the western United States, if we had slow lives, I don't think we would've had a huge impact by going and camping for a week.

Speaker 3:          01:09:57       But today when you're pulled out of your crazy digital electronic life and you go back and we feel that human simplicity for a little bit of time, I think the combination of the two offers a really powerful place. Really crazy. Because if you can get that awareness and sort of that the impact of slowing down. Yeah. Compounded with all of the information and the power and everything that we have. I think it's, I think so. I think we're on the verge or a very ripe place. I think it's a, it's a time where, um, you know, people can, can really change themselves all a lot quicker or maybe even a lot more than they think is. That's another thing I would love for people just to think or believe that things could be different, that they could change. You know, because I, I mean, that's what I've been involved in for so long and it's just, it is possible.

Speaker 4:          01:10:48       Well, I think also any kind of a trip, whether it's a meditative trip or even just a camping trip or something where you have that opportunity to sort of reset and reassess, it gives you sovereignty, gives you personal sovereignty instead of just being just caught up in the momentum. A buddy of mine, my friend, Ari, should fear again, bringing them up again. It was with another buddy of mine, big Jay Oakerson and they were, uh, they were watching this couple make out through a window. They were doing the podcast and uh, they were on the roof and they were watching this couple through the window. It's a couple making out. And then in the middle of making out, they started checking their phones. This is, this is what's going on today. I was kind of sad. It's kind of sad, but maybe they'd go suck in bed for the better. But if, you know, it's, you got to not just have all this access to data but also have the ability to decide what you take in and what you don't take care. And I think that's, that's the, we're passing the wildlife viewing area cause I went to, well they think they're talking about the humans that live here

Speaker 3:          01:12:01       near in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. I think it's kind of super a super charged time for that man. And it's cool to see people like literally change your life. I, one other thing, I'm involved in his, I, I started a men's group in Bozeman where I live in Montana and I've been a part of men's groups for a while, a while, probably six or seven years. I think it's something that's really not understood or really not even knowing about, but really odd is it's a group of guys that get together to really practice being completely real and I'm really clear all the bullshit out of the way and it's been incredibly helpful for me, for me. Um, where was I going with that? Oh yeah. But just that I've been party are privy to so many people just sort of like just changing like, you know, being a lot more fucking happy and a lot more productive and I think it's easy to get stuck in thinking that things just are how they are and what sovereignty is huge. That's the biggest thing. Like owning what you feel, honoring what you want, owning who you are, all of that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:03       Well, it's also a lot of times people that get out of high school to going to college and get out of college and get a job and get a job and start the career they push forth and their career and before they know what they're fucking 40 years old and they can't stop the momentum of the life and then not enjoying it.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       No, they're desperate, dude. They're quiet. They're quietly desperate.

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       Yeah. It wasn't that Toro. Most men lead lives of quiet desperation. It's such a great fucking quote.

Speaker 3:          01:13:30       So why aren't we teaching every 17 year old kid who's coming out of high school like, Hey, that's, that's probably your future. You know, once you get on top of this.

Speaker 4:          01:13:40       No. How you teach people like this. Yeah. They listen to podcasts to hear people talk. They realize that their parents didn't have a fucking awesome information, you know, and look a lot of pants, they mean the right thing when they tell them get a good job. Don't take any chances. You know, y'all, you got a dream, Huh? Yeah, I will. Uh, dreams don't pay the bills. They don't, they're not doing that because they're assholes for the most part. They're doing that because that's been their experience, their life. And they don't want their kid to be a fucking idiot. And they don't, they don't understand. They don't. They don't know. But, so listen up fuckers, like, look around, look around, look around and notice how many adults either have shitty lives they don't like or are like going through massive amounts of self help or therapy or all these things at all ages.

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       And not, you know, too. What are you thinking antidepressants come from? Did that many people have broken brains or is there, I'm, I'm not denying that there's most certainly quite a few people that have natural chemical imbalances and pharmaceutical drugs can benefit them. That's, that's true. Absolutely. No doubt about it. But I know for a fact there's a lot of people who get medicated because they fucking hate their lives. Instead of picking a life that you enjoy or working towards developing your life. And it's something that you would enjoy, you know? And one of the, some of the most satisfying, uh, email and twitter, tweets, twitters, tweet messages, and facebook things that I've ever gotten is people that have listened to this podcast and said, you know what? I realized I am 36 and I, I've always wanted to do this and I'm going to quit my fucking job, but I'm gonna figure out how to do that.

Speaker 4:          01:15:25       I'm going to work towards that. I'm going to save up some money and I'm gonna fucking whatever it is I'm going to make pottery. I'm going to start fucking selling my paintings. So whatever the fuck it is, everybody's got a thing. And if you don't have a thing, find the fucking thing. But you can't think that that whole like work, get a good job, get your benefits and, and don't, don't do anything stupid because you don't want to get fired. That life is bullshit. That is bullshit life. Totally. If you got a good job that you enjoy, that's a great life and then your job doesn't feel like a job. I mean, even though it's, it can be challenging and difficult. If you could find something you actually enjoy doing, your life will be immeasurably better than if you're just grinding it out waiting for that five o'clock fucking Buzzer to come right away.

Speaker 4:          01:16:17       I like to talk about it though. I think he's a really important difference is to be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Because if you try to force yourself into, if you're trying to be Joe Rogan or if you're trying to be anybody else out there, you want that life like, like good luck with that in the long run. Like I feel like you have to sink into yourself and just actually fucking be who you are like that. It's hard to find though, right? It is hard to find who you are. It totally is. But that's the, I think that's your job until you're, until you are who you are and that's wrong the way, don't be embarrassed if you're pretending to be somebody else. Cause I think we all get that when you're trying to find yourself telling. Me and I most certainly have been massively influenced by a lot of people that I respected and, and, and listen to them or watch them or saw their work or whatever it is.

Speaker 4:          01:17:06       That's okay as long as you eventually figure out who you are and then it kind of happened to you before you even know it. Like when I was young man, I always, I never felt very secure and I always was like, God, I wish I could fucking be someone. Like all these people that I admire. Like I wish I could figure out how to be me instead of wishing I was all these other people. And somewhere along the line, it's just Kinda, if you pursue what you actually enjoy, it kind of happens totally. But it's not, it's not an easy process and it's a process of self reflection and you gotta be honest. And that's where these moments that you're talking about, like meditative moments or moments where you can go to the mountains and be by yourself. Those moments are huge because they give you this opportunity to maybe examine your ideas a little more closely instead of just constantly being, Eh, just inundated with other people's opinions about what you,

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       you should have your own experiences, man. You gotta just, you just got to live and you got to experiences. That's what I think you've got to experience as much as you can. Whether that's a trip around the world are traveling or to a different place or a hallucinogenic experience it done in a safe way or whatever it is. I just feel like you got to, yeah, to find yourself. You'd be, you gotta. You gotta test the waters. He got wires all over them. And if you're born in this fucking town that we're driving through, good luck handing out cash pay day loans. Man, I grew up in a place way smaller and tidier than this real review. Dan Dodi is, he made it through 600 people. 600 how many of them you fuck? We left. We left when I was in sixth grade. So unfortunately these are probably better off that way.

Speaker 2:          01:18:51       What's your fuck people they think getting the, Oh, I'm sorry. Jesus. Kate. Just leave me alone. Oh Shit. Out of here. I got super lucky man. So yeah, I grew up in a tiny little place. 10 miles from the Canadian border of North Dakota. Just like nothing going on. You know, maybe this place. Gasoline Alley. Speedway casino. There's a casino in there that's a casino and a 24 hour gas station. Fuck, you can hit it big. They're, yeah. Cash loans on car titles. That's the fucking title of the goddamned store. Cash loans on car titles. How many people give up their cars here for alone? Wow. Is this fallon? Um, it's not, it's not even say what it is. Okay. For bastards, wherever this is. Yeah. This was

Speaker 4:          01:19:43       Stockman's casino spin. And when Saturdays come play,

Speaker 2:          01:19:49       yeah. A lot of people you read smoking going on there. I bought a cigarette smoking. A lot of people here can describe with a gun tastes like in your mouth. It doesn't taste good, it doesn't taste good, but it seems like if you know that, that that's a possibility.

Speaker 4:          01:20:09       What a strange places. There's a lot of these places that we drove through. Like how about that one? Wild West town there was established in 1865, I don't remember the name of it, but they had the old buildings there that were there from 1865 that were in ruins and various state of disarray and decay surrounded by these, uh, more new modern ruins that people were living in. Well, yeah, the old ones. Yeah. Yeah, they did cause they, they got something. There's some class or some weird about like mobile homes and like really shitty aluminum siding and stuff. You know? No one's ever going to be pumped to find that someday. No. You mean like a hundred years from now or 3000 years from now if you find an old bar, like that old barn that we were passing and that little shack or whatever fucking was it cooled cabin of distressed wood.

Speaker 4:          01:21:07       You look at that and you go, wow, that's kind of bad ass. No one's going to like look at some shitty old aluminum sided fucked up house. What you're saying is quality spans time. That American flags a little too big for my liking. It's at half mast. Did somebody die while we were in the woods? Some shit. But when a flags at half mast, that's what it means. Right? We missed something. We probably don't know a lot of fucking things that went down for seven days. That's gotta be a good thing. We know that two Olympic swimmers got robbed at gunpoint in Brazil. Way to go. Do you feel better knowing that?

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       No, no, no, no. I feel like, ah, I feel better that I was in the woods and I wasn't in cabin Brazil with a gun pointed at my head. Poor bastards. But no,

Speaker 4:          01:21:58       there's a lot of, uh, we have to look, we should know that that's possible. That people can get robbed like a, when you hear about terrible things in the world, the good news or the good fact about that is now you know those things without having, it's not like you live your life in some sort of a Mormon missionary factory and then they send you out there to the awful parts of the world and all of a sudden, you know, you're in some third world country and you don't realize it's being run by a brutal dictator. And what's a dictator like, you know, North Korea. What is it like? It's good to know that North Korea is out there and there's some Kim Jong Un type dudes in the world.

Speaker 2:          01:22:40       Yes. When I was little when I was a kid, but not all the time and definitely not a gun point. I got in the wrong cap once and the border of Ecuador and Peru and got stuck up, they call it soft kidnapped, where uh, this other dude got the back of the text and they started driving out in the jungle.

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       Oh Shit. Asking me questions about politics and my family and all this stuff. Oh my God, I didn't really know. I was just, I was down there learning Spanish. I didn't know a global yet. And um, I basically said, listen guys a fucking got nothing. I have like 40 bucks. Right. So they drove me to an ATM and I'm like, I got, I got, I got like 80 bucks more out of them are out and they gave it to him and then ran like fucking just took off. Wow. That was pretty sketchy. That's the other thing that happened in Brazil recently presented Jujitsu student from Australia, I believe was out there. He got kidnapped by these cops. Cops took him to two ATM machines and made them withdraw money. Yeah. Yeah. Cops, cops. Fuck you want to trust them. But you know what man? It's like again, what the fuck happened to them and what happened?

Speaker 4:          01:23:51       What happened to these people that are robbing these people? Something bad. They, it's not necessarily 100% their fault that that's who they've become. I'm not taking away ownership of their own actions, but you got to think about the development of their ideas, how it happened. I had this friend of mine on the podcast recently and he was talking about, he grew up in a standards Byron bowers and he grew up in a really poor area of Georgia and a lot of crime where he was just a lot of like really fucked up family environments and he was saying that when we thought about like robin something like go into a store and stealing something, we didn't think it was a bad thing because that's how you get it. That's how you get things. You've got to go get it, you got to go steal and that it was just, that's what you grew up.

Speaker 4:          01:24:45       Now he's a successful comedian and he's doing well and it's like he can step back and have the hindsight vision of his current state and like realize like, oh, that was why I thought that way. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm sure these guys that robbed you, I mean they didn't have a fucking pretty upbringing. There was nothing, it's not like they went from a gated community to robin people in Peru. No, it's not like they are doing it because they were just morally poor people, you know? I mean I don't think so. They were. Maybe they were, but what made them that way? Think about your own little boy. He's two months old. I mean you get to shape what that boy becomes as he becomes a man and someone did that to the Guy who robbed you in Peru, you know? I mean that is, that's how it goes. I mean it really sort of highlights the bizarre nature of humans raising humans. We should really be raised by robots. We should, yeah, someone should come along and just make the perfect human razor. Now obviously not, you know, you're, I'm sure you're going to do a great job, but for people who, whose parents are going to do a shitty job, I wonder if they're going to come up with technology one day and I think they will, that will be able to install better memories and a better pattern of

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       behavior in a person's brain. Like almost like they're going to be able to defrag your hard drive. Sure. You mean just like with a click of a switch, but he's a little hook you up to him. Like say if somebody gave you a computer, right? But it has a virus on it. It's all fucked up. Every time you check your email and sends you dick pictures and it takes you to rush an escort sites like you mother fuckers, which you did in my phone. If the your your computer, your computer is fucked, right, dude. But if you bring it down to the computer store, the guy can go, oh, you got a virus. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna, we're gonna wipe your hard drive clean, reinstall your operating system, and then I'll back up your crucial files and add them later. Sure. That's, that's got to be the future of human beings.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       I think you're totally right. But I think that there's some things that are acting in that way already. There's participate in your child's life, even if it's uncomfortable suit, man, what the fuck? Massive. No, they're sharing the message. I know, but what is that? If it's uncomfortable, even if it's an that's a billboard here, the middle of nowhere participating in your child's life, even if it's uncomfortable. Who though? Fuck sees that billboard and goes, you know what? I'm going to stop ignoring my kids doing math. I'm going to participate even if it's uncomfortable because I need my math. Well, fuck man. If that sign makes it happen for one fucking kid. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I would, I was saying there's a lot of recent research and study that that has happened, specifically

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       ptsd and in, in that realm that shows how memories and our experiences when we're young and older, how they truly are stored in our body and that there are techniques available now that truly can unlock and free those. And it's, it's, it's not psychology in the sense of just talk therapy or just figuring things out or analyzing. I think it's, it's, it's much more a body body based. So the idea is that if there is an experience that happens, the natural human ranges too, if it's overwhelming, right? You fight, you run or flight or you freeze. And it's the freezing that these people will argue that things literally get like locked and etched into your bodies, either yourselves or your musculature. Well, I dunno what, wherever it is, but that through processes of awareness and relaxation and, and being able to go into that, you really can open and release a lot of that.

Speaker 3:          01:28:40       So it's not an automatic hit a button defrag the entire thing. But there are things that people do that, that truly work in that way and in that direction. And it's not mainstream at all. You know, I think it will be one day and actually really think it will be. Um, but I think that there's proof now that things are more malleable, our memories are more malleable, are sort of set patterns, although they're very firm can be shifted. And I think there's a lot of hope in that. I think it's really cool. I, I don't, I don't feel like that's an accepted viewpoint at this point.

Speaker 4:          01:29:16       Well, I think it's being more and more accepted. I think people are understanding now more and more that there's a method that the human mind has sort of undergone in order to take these memories in the first place. And if there's a way to reexamine those initial ideas and form new ideas based on better data and a better understanding of how your actual, your mind works. Very few people know how their mind works. They just know that I get mad when this happens. Sure. This pisses me off. And you know what, one thing that's uh, a beautiful idea that has been going around is look at something when it happens and decide how to make that a positive for you and decide how to give that thing meaning because nothing truly has any meaning other than the meaning that you give it. And the meaning that I might have to something might be very different than you would have for the exact same experience.

Speaker 4:          01:30:19       And we don't even know who's right or wrong until you look at like where that path takes you. And I might look at it, go, you know what 10 toady was right. I should just let that brush off my shoulders. Look, he did and now he's doing great. Me. I'm still carrying around that one fucked up experience. Yeah. I mean there's people that are still repeating arguments that they had in the ninth grade while they're in their car. They're sitting there going, this motherfucker thinks you can get away with that off to cause us. Oh, go fucking foreign number. I know for sure tomorrow, girl. Ooh, yeah, yeah. There's a lot of, a lot of stuff that we carry around in our brains and we don't know why it's even there. It's just bouncing around and he got to do a cleanup, uh, de Frag.

Speaker 3:          01:30:59       Yeah. Well I think one of the best tools to begin that entire process is simple mindfulness practices, which are, so what that means is that when something fucked up happens and you're going to immediately have that knee jerk reaction, all it is is that you, you have, you keep it a little fucking space and you let it be there and then you can decide to freak out or do whatever you want.

Speaker 4:          01:31:20       Give it a lot of space. Give it a lot of space and think about it. Don't, don't let the momentum of every event run your life because you'll just be bouncing from one catastrophe to the next and mindfulness is like a term that gets really bandied about a lot lately, but I think the way you're describing it as she is very important like under examine these things.

Speaker 3:          01:31:43       Yeah, it is. It is. It, well, it's an overused terminance and a misunderstood term, but I think in, it's a very simple, practical way. It's just being able to just being aware of what's happening, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:31:55       and being in the moment, being in the moment. Don't live in the past. Thinking about the argument that you got in the ninth grade. Don't think about your future. Only think about this moment right now because this is what you have. Look, you and I are in this car driving down this godforsaken shit hole highway. We could get hit in the head with a fucking media before this podcast even makes it to the Internet. We don't know. We're assuming right now as we speak in the dimension of this is going to get out, but it might not. It might not.

Speaker 3:          01:32:22       I like what you said about you know, taking things as learning opportunities, you know in general that that just anything in life that happens to you, whether it's good or bad is an opportunity you can capitalize them. Just cause you can learn from it. You know

Speaker 4:          01:32:36       you can, it's just, it's hard to break free of the parents and you used to have, that's where I really advocate self help books, you know? Even though like a lot of people think self help books are bullshit. You know why their bullshit because most people don't really listen. They don't really know. They don't do anything to try to change the pattern of behavior that they're stuck in. They just read the book and you go, oh well they don't do anything. You've got to do something about it. But being inspired, you know, even sometimes a fucking really good movie can change your life because it, it'll make a little incremental change in a certain direction. And then over time, that could be a gigantic factor in determining your happiness or your unhappiness depending on like how you choose to behave and think.

Speaker 3:          01:33:24       Yeah, I think there's a big stigma to against self help. And then I think for guys especially, but probably for everybody that we just got to get over that shit, you know, it's got gotta be okay and I don't know because all of that self help spiritual type stuff that's, you know, made fun of and made fun of for good reasons. But, but there's some, there's some things in there that, that aren't all that right.

Speaker 4:          01:33:56       There's been just incredibly health Yonis patellas calling us, don't get no fuck you hang up on him. How's it going to, I was going to talk to him and say something silly, but we're, when a podcast, Yani, I hope you understand 60 miles outside of Reno, wherever the fuck we are. We're headed to the metropolis of Reno, Nevada. Andrew dice clay was here the day before we left, but the show day we're leaving. Yeah, I was, uh, I was going to call them and say hi, stop on it. But we had to drive five hours to the middle of nowhere. Um, so let's wrap this thing up was bring it on back home. But I think your life experiences and what you're trying to do is very knowable dude. And I think what you're trying to do and what you have done is very exceptional. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this with you because this story is that you were telling me over this past weekend, the all the other times we've hung out together over the past few years since I met you in 2012.

Speaker 4:          01:35:04       Is that a copy hit the brakes with the cops, the fuzz baby instead of cop? Nope. Nope. It looks like, um, those stories are there. Powerful man. And I think, uh, it's, it's nice for people to know there's people like you out there. Thanks man. I appreciate that. So anything else you'd like to say to the world? Cause it's not, I used to say America than people in Europe got mad at me. I don't think so. No, that's it. And Dan dougherty has spoken. You fucks. So Dan is most likely going to start his own podcast someday. And I know people like, God damn it, Rogan, you're always trying to get people to start podcasts. It's not even my idea. You fucking assholes. It's dead until these idea. He wants to do a podcast. And I think if you did want it would be awesome. So hopefully, uh, you will do that and I'll have you on again when you're launching that and we'll let everybody know about that. Thanks man. Appreciate it. All right, my brother, thank you so much and thank you everybody for listening and, uh, that's it. We're done. See Ya. Bye. Bye. Wow.
