Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Boom, and we're live. There's a lot of rich people in the world, but it's not a lot of rich people live in like you. So first of all, before we even get started, I salute you sir, because if I was a 16 year old kid and I won the lottery, I'd be living exactly the way you live. Like if you asked a 16 year old kid, hey man, if you had 100 million bucks, what would you do? Oh Dude, I just have, I just have bitches around me all the time. I'd be jet skiing, I'd be driving around in Ferrari's and private jets. You live in like a, a life that doesn't even seem real. It's A. Does it seem real to you?

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       Um, now it seems normal. As crazy as that sounds. I've been doing it for awhile, but that's actually kind of exactly what I did. I was um, I think it started in maybe like 2000, 11, 12. So I had a girlfriend for about two or three years and she was pretty happy that she was a playmate. She had like 100,000 followers and she was going to move to La to become famous and this and that. And we ended up breaking up and I actually ended up getting a place in San Diego. Then I got a place in La and I started playing this real big poker and I mean I beat one guy for like $54 million and then I'd be another guy for like 10 and you know, so there's some pretty big Christ. Yeah, like, you know what I'm saying, it's just like there are some pretty big wins there.

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       And uh, and I was single and I was just like, you know what, fuck it. I'm just Kinda Kinda like do bucket list shit. Like whatever, like whatever I wanted to do when I was a kid, I'm just going to fucking deal, you know. And I just did and I posted about it and it was like, part of the posting was because I knew it'd be able to get me some pussy without like actually speaking to girls, which was good. And then there's like another piece of it where it was kind of like a fuck you to her, but it was never like really to become famous, you know what I mean? It was just kinda like just doing my thing and you know, we're getting pictures here and there. Uh, and then it kind of, I mean fuck it's, you know, I mean I sent you some of the stats. I mean I think like a week ago, like I fuck, I reach a $175 million people.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Just those insane you sent me, uh, some, some measurement of all the different people that are looking at your stuff. And I'll read it because it's insane. Analytics. Yeah. Like it doesn't even make sense. These, it's hundreds of millions of people here will see hidden hundred 61 million, 300, 4,000, 941 impressions this week. That's insane.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       Grant, you know, like facebook's a whole nother thing. And, and, and, and it's really underrepresented because first of all everybody else is buying all their followers and the likes and all their shifts. So there's this like really inflated and also I actually kind of like the opposite because I got a lot of people that are looking at my shit. They can't really be seen looking at my shit, you know what I mean? Like there was like some big producer, I won't say his name, but like every time I posted a girl, like they get hit up in the D and this is like a big, big, like, you know, like fucking, like $100, million

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       dollar movies and shit. And he's like, hits them all up, you know. So there's like a lie. It just stopped me out like this Marsianno this fucking guy is like every time I posted chick she's got a guest campaign now, you know. So it's like, it's kind of funny, you know, it's great for them to. Then what, what I'm saying is they're not actually like officially fall and click that button on my shit. They're stocking you. Target. Yeah. So they hit that search button and you're at the top of the list always because they're always searching you. That's funny. Seems like. So how long has this been going on? When did you start making all these crazy posts? And when did this gambling rampage start? Um, well, I mean I've been here

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       gamble for a long time, but um, I think kind of the craziness I would say started in 2012 probably. I just distinctly remember because I, I won like $11, million bucks in a night and my buddy who I just give them like $2,000 to made me a million off it because he got second in the world series of poker. So I had like a $12,000,000 a week. So I was like, fuck it, I'm going to take this dude down to Puerto Vallarta with a bunch of chicks and we're going to have fun, you know. And that was Kinda like, um, that was, that was one of the big. Actually not, I'm sorry, I take that back. I'd broken up with my girlfriend and it was a buddy of mine, nick cassavetes, who he's like know he's pretty big. Uh, he did like the notebook and blow and you know, like the director or whatever. And um, I played poker with him a lot and I just broke it up my girl and I was like, Hey, let's go down to Cabo, I'm going to bring some chicks. And it was supposed to be me, him and one other guy and the other guy ended up bailing but he had committed so he paid for his part of the trip. So it was me and nick and I think it was like, I want to say 17 chicks.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       I remember I had sex nine times in one day. I was like, so proud of myself, right. I think by the end I was like, it was like dust was coming out. It was like, it was funny because I didn't even want to have sex the night time, but it was just kinda like a, like a matter of principle. It's like have a billion a billionaires walking down the street and he sees $100 bill. He says, always going to pick it up. You know what I mean? That was me. I didn't get a lot of pussy when I was younger. So it was like, it was a hot chick, fuck. We like, I didn't care about wanting to beggars, just like obligation. So 17 girls. Yep. Now the pay these girls to come. Okay. So that's the big misconception on addressing that. On my app. I actually nap, I've got an APP coming out and I'm just going to basically, but you know what, I'll give it to you for free, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:05:24       So um, I'm not opposed to paying for sex, you know, like, I mean I have in the past like I've, you know, fuck thousands of girls. So it's like, you know, and I paid for maybe like 10 or 20, something like that. And it's not because I have any moral dilemma about it and it's not because I think it's wrong. Um, in fact, I think like sex for money is one of the most like pure interactions because the guy gets what he wants, the girl gets what she wants. There's no bullshit. I think like this whole like sugar daddy, sugar baby thing is the biggest fucked up part because then the guy's like pretending to like the girl pretending he's not

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       fucking other girls. The girls pretending to like him. It's just like all this like convoluted bullshit is prostitution at the end of the day, like it is paying for sex. Right. But they're not coming out and saying it. It's not like, hey, I want x and I'll give you why. It's like the guy from the clippers, donald sterling and that girl. Come on man, these are all, they all have like, you know, these five girlfriends there supporting them and then the girls have other boyfriends. They don't tell, you know, and it's this whole fucked up thing. But like I said, but for me, like I said, it's not a moral thing. It's not a. I mean for me it's not a monetary thing. Obviously I'd much prefer to just give a girl money fucker and be done. But for me, if the girl's not into me then I'm just like kind of not into the sex. So that's the hangup for me. But no, I, I, that's actually healthy. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       I mean it is. I mean make these big judgments there. They're going to make big judgments on you first of all because you're doing some stuff that's just like so far to the right end of the spectrum. It doesn't even make sense. Like how the fuck is he pulling all this off? It doesn't. It's like it seems unattainable, so they're gonna make well he's this guy is wrong and these gi would never do that. They're saying a bunch of crazy shit because the way you're living is just so bizarre. But at the end of the day, that's the thing, like people just can't wrap their hands around the fact that like, you know, they,

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       because so many guys are paying right now, like people are tricking off in record numbers because of instagram and all this stuff and the access that people have like

Speaker 4:          00:07:22       tricking off being, paying for, paying for sex in like record numbers. Like it's unbelief. First of all, it should be legal, just like getting a massage should be legal. No, nobody wants to rub your feet. Nobody wants to suck your Dick, but it should be able to pay both of them. It's the oldest profession like since the history of time. It is. It is. Well, not only that, they taught chimpanzees the value of currency that gave chimpanzees coins and they gave them coins and then every time the chimps had given the coins to back to the people that give them candy. You know the chimps did the first fucking thing they did. They gave the coins, the female chimps, and they fucked up surveys. That's the first thing they did, and the researchers like Jesus. That is number one. The first thing they did, that's what it added.

Speaker 4:          00:08:05       Another layer. I used to have a little bit about it. It's nothing. There's nothing wrong with it and like making pleasure. A crime is ridiculous. There's no victim, no one's getting her. Think of all the shitty jobs that you can get paid to do. You can get paid to clean toilets. You can get paid to fucking insulate addicts. There's a lot of terrible jobs that you can get paid to mop up the. Come on a fucking on the floors of these like, you know, jerk houses or the place or whatever, you know, it's, it's like, I don't know. I, like I said, I have no issues with it. I think it should be legal. Um, it's a victimless crime. Yeah. I just

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       like for, like I said, for me it's, it's the, it's the mental thing and I just like, I, I got, I couldn't fuck all the girls, you know, if I had five dicks. So it's like, what? And I'm not like bragging like

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       I used to, I'm just, you know, I'm just kicking you the real deal, you know? It's like I should.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       I said, there's no victims. I kissed. There is some, there's victims of some prostitution, right? There's a people that are abducted and there's certain people that are like sex traffic, like sex slaves. That's real, but we're not talking about it

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       that we're talking about. That's exactly what you said, that, that sex slavery, that's not really like a girl saying, hey, I want x for y. that's her saying, hey, you got to do this and you're getting your ass beat.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       There's a big way, bigger difference, a big difference between that and a lot of what you see in La as these girls, they want to wear the nice purses and have nice shoes and they don't really want a job and they want to live in a nice apartment but they don't want to work. How do I work this out?

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       And by the way, getting back to your last thing, if it was legal, there wouldn't be, you know, the pimp saying, hey, you're going to do this. You're gonna. Get your ass beat. It will all be regulated just like drug dealers and also then than the beginning, you know, tested and you know, they're just be like a whole regulated system.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       Exactly. I mean, as much as I hate pain pills and as much as I have lost friends to pain pills and oxides and all this different shit, there's no fucking wars being fought over it. There's not blood in the streets of war as Mexico over pain pills. You know, all that shit is over drugs that are illegal. As soon as those drugs become legal, I think probably less people would use them and you'd get tax dollars from them and the least there would be some sort of a solution in terms of treatment and responsibility and he'd be able to look at it a little bit differently.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       Yeah. I just think there's too much money and kickbacks for that to happen, but I, I totally agree. I mean, I think alcohol is far worse for you than many drugs and I mean, you know, I mean how many times have you seen people get into fights or shoot people or you know, wreck their cars because they're high on al or high on weed, you know, it never happens. Never happens on alcohol, you know, more people are dying from alcohol related deaths and there are firearms, but they want to ban the guns, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:10:51       Yeah. It's, there's, there's a lot of real problems with that for sure. And you know, there's also these companies like the company that makes a fentanyl fentanyl, it's super strong pain pill, a painkiller that's 10 times at least more powerful than a oxycontin's. I believe that's what the numbers, they're spending $500,000 just to keep marijuana illegal in Arizona because they're, you know, they've got it on the ballot to make it recreationally legal in the state of Arizona and so they're putting out all these ads and they have this whole campaign to try to sway people, but they're just doing it for business. It has nothing to do with public safety or health. You see a fucking thing about Hillary Clinton. One of the Wiki leaks things that Hillary Clinton, she. Wikileaks released some paper where she was in communication with bankers, one of the emails and she was saying that she was going to stop weed and that she was going to make sure that we're, uh, was not legal. Then she was gonna, do her best and stand her ground. And all this nonsense leak reveals Clinton promise bankers to stand against marijuana legalization. Like, what the fuck? Hillary. She's pretty brutal. Just what the fuck. I know you're bought and sold, but don't you have enough money, lady, how much money you need? Unless you're gambling with Dan Bilzerian,

Speaker 3:          00:12:05       where the fuck's all your money going? I read. It's kind of funny because what did they pay these presidents like 250 k a year,

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       $400,000 a year and they're all worth hundreds of millions of dollar or billionaires, you know, it's insane. Yeah. Well, not only that, like she was trying to say that once bill got out of the office, he was dead broke. Well, you're not dead broke now, so how the fuck did you guys make all that money that they're worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. It's all from speaking arrangements and pay to play and weird fucking shady deals they have with banks and they do these speeches that nobody wants to fucking here and they pay him a quarter million bucks an hour. So preposterous. Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       the more money you have and the more you kind of rub shoulders with these people, you kind of get a look behind the curtain and you see that, you know, it's just uh, it's, I mean politics. If you look up the definition of politics, I mean it's like bullshitting, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       Well that is being political is not being yourself, which is the opposite of what you're doing. I mean you're kind of like an anti politician it a lot of ways, but do you want to get at though is do you get hit up because you're, you're so wealthy. Do you get hit up by people that are in the political spectrum that want to use your influence and your. You have, how many followers do you have?

Speaker 3:          00:13:16       A 19 point something on instagram and it's 10 and a half million on facebook and twitter. Twitter, but I mean that's insane. The whole UFC. Yeah. The reach is tracking

Speaker 1:          00:13:29       point 2 million followers. That's crazy. And it's all just pictures of you grabbing titties. Like, look at this one right here. This is what? This one's hilarious. It's like someone told you that you shouldn't. You should post something a little more

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       team is like, you got to clean this up. You know, like, you know there's a new team. Fuck your team. Like there's all this money out there. You know, you know this, this, uh, this rocky got paid $70, million bucks to indoors for the, like you can make all this money.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       Yeah. Oh, what do you do with it? Just drive a truck. A big truck. It does afford a commercial $70 million. It's probably worth it though for them. The Rock has like $67 million or some insane shit, but he's a goddamn movie star. Do two takes pictures with.

Speaker 3:          00:14:11       That's a thing, you know, like I feel like I got to be maybe the most famous guy that never had like a TV show or like a real talent. One hundred percent. No one even close. That's kind of rare to be like number one and anything, you know. So that's kind of cool. You're the number one baller. Well I don't know about that from America. We're the number one power. I'm giving you the crown right now. Burger King, crown. I put it on your head. I can tell you some stories about some guys that know who you are when nobody knows who they are. Public ball for sure. I'm the only guy that's kind of putting it out there because, you know, most guys they got, they got a job, they get a wife, the family, you know, whatever. I just Kinda just said fuck all of it, you know, like they can accept

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       me or not and I, I'm just going to do it all. How old are you? Thirty five. Do you think that there's gonna come a day when this is going to be tired and if you, if it does come a day, do you think you're ever going to go the marriage route? Is that possible at this point? So look, you know, I'm a gambler. I don't want to bet half of my net worth. I'm a lucky girl forever,

Speaker 2:          00:15:10       but that's not to say that I wouldn't have a girlfriend or you know what I'm capable of being monogamous.

Speaker 4:          00:15:16       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:15:18       you know, it's just for me it's more about options really. Look at the end of the day, it comes down to most guys earn relationships I feel like because it's either, hey, I'm going to jerk off on Saturday night or I've got to put up with her shit. And I get laid, you know, and it's like in a lot of, it's out of laziness. A lot of it's not a lack of options, whatever the case may be, but it's not correct. Like for me, I think a correct relationship as a guy that could be fucking, you know, five or 10 girls and he chooses to hang out with this one girl because he likes her and he likes hanging out with her and she hangs out with him because she enjoys his company. And regardless of what the reason is, you know, because a lot of people are like, Oh, you know, that girl's a gold digger or they want to hate on them. Um, but you know, at the end of the day if a guy has made his money from successful business and, you know, being smart and, and he hasn't fucked it off like, you know, or he's a doctor, whatever. That to me is more of a part of who that guy is. Then a girl that's just born hot. So for a guy to like a girl just because she's hot, I feel like it's like the most superficial thing of all time.

Speaker 4:          00:16:20       Well, I mean chess would be nice to. She can't. I mean hopefully she does,

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       but I'm saying a lot of guys are with a girl just because she's hot and they don't really get as much shit as a girl that's with a guy because he's successful because he has money.

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       It's true. It is true. It is true. Like the guy who earned that money, it's his character and his willpower and his discipline that's allowed him, his smarts is allowed him to earn that money or he just got lucky as fuck. And there's definitely some lucky ones but

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       you know, you also have to hold onto it. I mean once you got money, I mean you got every asshole and their mother with their handout, you know, trying to scam you and it's easy to, you know, fuck it off or

Speaker 4:          00:16:54       you know, make bad investments or you know, whatever the case might be. Yeah, it is. That's, it is a funny little situation there, isn't it? Because like it's also the way women are allowed to dress even like a, like a respectable woman is allowed to have her tits pressed together and pushed up and she's allowed to have a skirt that's just like a little, a little light, vagina curtain, you know, and it's really all it is. Little panties underneath and smooth legs and high heels. I mean the whole thing is sex selling, lust. Let's talk about bathing suits and the fact that every bathing suit now, is it basically a thong and the fact that like a bathing suit shows more than like the most revealing underwear back in the day. Ever used to, but it's like completely socially acceptable. Then on Halloween they could wear even less than that. They paint. Okay. Yeah. It's like literally, but naked. When the fuck did paint become close, magically put on our deck and went

Speaker 5:          00:17:49       out. You'd get arrested, right? Well how come a girl can wear on tits became, were paying on your Dick? I want to know. I want to know. Oh, that's a double standard. It is a double standard. Nobody wants to see your Dick painted it up. That's why especially with like American flag or something. Yeah. I don't want to see a bunch of zebra. It is weird. There are weird double standards, but it's also people don't want to open their mouth because they don't want. First of all, they don't want anybody to think that they, you know, like why do women get do is not, oh, what are you complaining? Poor guy, you know, you don't want to hear that. But it's also when men complain about the double standard in like, like marriage, like what you said as far as it being a gamble. It's a terrible gamble for a wealthy man. It's terrible because it's, it's essentially a financial agreement. It's not a love agreement.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       Well No, you're asking the government permission to be with a girl and if you decide that you don't want to be with them, now you have to go ask the government and then you have to get lawyers involved. And it's this whole process that in my eyes it makes both parties field. Well, not both parties because usually, you know, it's kind of like a magnet, like one is pushing a little bit further than, than the other. And so there's one kind of like always chasing or whatever. So for me it just makes the party that's a little bit less invested, just feel trapped. And when you're in a relationship and you feel trapped, the first thing you want to do is run, right? So you've got this one person, you know, that inevitably ends up feeling trapped and the other person you know, kind of gets lazy or complacent.

Speaker 2:          00:19:16       And I feel like it just snowballs, you know, there's like a lot of momentum things, right? So if relationships just starts kind of going downhill and you're trapped in it because you're legally bound, I just feel like it's just gonna get worse and worse and the girl is going to stop giving them blowjobs and the guy's going to resent it and then maybe he cheats. You know what I mean? It's like this whole cycle that just wouldn't happen if you were hanging out because he wanted to hang out because let's face it, if you're, if you're hanging out with the chicken, you like her, she's cool and then she just decides to just completely let herself go and she turns into a fat ass and or she just like stopped wanting to have sex and you're just going to fuck other girls or you're just not going to hang out with it. Right. But if you're married to or you don't really have a choice. I mean now you're kind of like, you got to ask the government permission and you know, this and that.

Speaker 5:          00:19:56       Yeah. You got to get lawyers involved. You live in the same place. You gotta Oh, it takes forever. You have to agree on terms and you have to pay for her lawyer. Do you mean how brutal is that? Like you're like literally like trapped in the same house as the birth, you know, it's just like, it can get crazy, it can get crazy and I've seen it get crazy. I'm sure you have to. When people get divorced, I mean it is one of the most stressful things a person go through in their life and when you're working, you're working all day and if she's not working, that's when it's really crazy. I had a buddy who was going through a divorce, his wife never worked and he was working 10, 12 hours a day, just busting his ass constantly as his own business and she would be fucking off and doing whatever she wanted during the day. He had to pay for all that on top of paying for her lawyer and her lawyer was trying to fuck him and then he had to pay for his lawyer to paddle her and they all

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       just dragged the whole thing out. Took over a year and a half for him to get divorced. Suffix, a year and a half. This poor bastard just means free now, but God damn, but try to get them married now. He'll fucking shoot you in the face if you even bring up that word. It's like he went through it. I mean they have a term for it and gambling. It's a negative free role. It's where you can basically only lose, you have no upside. You know, like for instance, a negative free roll is like if I were to tell you, hey, um, you know, if you can go bench press 300 pounds, I'll give you $10,000. Well I just can't win anything, you know what I mean? Because if you can't do it then I don't get anything. So it's Kinda like in my eyes, I just feel like as a situation where you can just lose its kinda like my buddy he got into a relationship and he just dove in like super hardcore really fast and I just told them, I said look like I just feel like you don't have a lot of upside by doing that because you know, you can get hurt and if you just take it slow, like worst case scenario, you know, you just weren't quite as close for a month.

Speaker 4:          00:21:43       But I said, you know, if it doesn't work out then now you invested all this time and this effort and it's like. And I feel like because he went so hardcore for this girl, it Kinda like, you know, sometimes it makes them run away a little bit because they know people, you know, they just by nature want what, they can't have rights. If you just give it all to him immediately, then it's Kinda like, like look at this bitch. Yeah, exactly. The kind of like lose respect for you a little bit. It can happen or it can be perfect. You know, relationships just have to be organic. That's what it really has to be. And as soon as you involve legal contracts, it's not organic anymore. Exactly. Once it, once I feel like once it starts to be forced in anyway, you know, then well it's when there's no prenuptial to.

Speaker 4:          00:22:26       That's when things get really screwy. You know, when you find out how much people actually have to pay. Like I've talked about it on my podcast before, but I have another buddy who's paying his ex wife for the rest of her life. They were married for 12 years. He has to pay her forever. Forever. Yeah. She's got a new boyfriend. He's married, he's got kids now with another woman to the most brutal part. It's when they, when they get to the boyfriend and now you're like support and this dude to bang your wife. Not only that, the dude lives in his house and every time they send a lawyer over to check the date, the guy packs up his stuff. It's like a joke. He throws it in a u haul. He drives around the corner, waits for the inspector to leave, goes all the way around and brings the shit back.

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       It's fucking insanity because you know, he's got this baller house in the palisades is living with this girl and the only way she gets screwed up because if she marries this guy, but this guy doesn't have any money, so she's never going to marry this guy. I mean she would, she would have to bank on marrying this guy would be worth, I think my buddy pays or somewhere around a half million dollars a year forever. Forever for life. So they've been, were married for 12 years, had been divorced for 15. So He's been paying her longer than they were married. Just want to just fucking jump off a bridge, but that's, you know, like I said, negative fruit. I just, I don't see the upside. Right. What's so rare that it works out the other way. It's so rare that a woman has to pay a man and it's one of those things where

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       it's like men are being victimized left and right by this and when you talk to people about their. I was like, Oh, you will. You fucked up. Well, you shouldn't have done it. Well, you should've got a prenup. Well, okay. Maybe. Maybe you could say all those things. Yes, maybe it was a mistake, but it was obviously a mistake under the, the whole spell of love. And to have this be a financial entanglements that can trap you in this one I'm talking about. My friend doesn't even have any kids. He didn't have any kids with this lady, so it's, it's insanity. It's just, it's just a robbery. It's just a legalized robbery. And I was having this conversation with a buddy of mine who is married. He's like, wow, you know, I don't look at it that way. I go, look at it this way, the the business of divorce and it is a business.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Whenever there's money involved in something, there's a bunch of people that try to figure out how to extract that money of the lawyer. The only money is in taking the money from the rich guy. That's where the money comes from. That's the only way you get the money. You don't get the money. If the girl doesn't make much money and everybody wins. If the rich guy gets fucked. So if the. If the legal battle for the divorce last two years as opposed to two minutes, everybody gets paid. The both lawyers on both sides make a substantial amount of money. The woman gets a substantial amount of money. The guy gets fucking drain like a vampire and that's what happens predominantly. Yeah. Which is usually the outcome of a lot of times when a rich guy gets involved in anything is yeah, he gets drained and that's kind of goes back to my previous point of why I feel like women that are attracted to guys that are successful, you know, it makes sense because there's just so many people trying to take that motherfucker down, you know, like when you're at the top of the hill, like, you know, everybody wants to, you know, get out there and bringing it down while it's nature.

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       I mean it's just like a moose having a fucking giant set of antlers. All the other moods. Like, oh, look at those antlers. And I mean it's just, it is a thing that exists in all different species. I mean there's no, there's no denying that. When a guy pulls up in a Rolls Royce and he flies into his own private jet, he does a bunch of things that nobody else can do, that people just go, oh, and women automatically genetically get attracted to that guy for some strange reason. There is you, you are buddy bawling, bawling, out of control. How did you get all your money originally?

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       So that's another common misconception and I didn't really, I didn't really talk about it or, or saying anything about it just because it helped me out so much in poker. Um, but everybody just thought that I was, you know, rich trust fund, idiot. Um, and then my parents gave me all my money so that actually allowed me to get into a lot of these poker games. Um, because they thought you were a fish. Yeah, it's like a weird thing. Um, it's not just that, but in poker I've noticed that if a guy loses money to another guy and he knows that that money's going to, that other guy out or his quality of life is going to be improved by that money. It really fucking irritates them. Like going. Yeah. And I'm guilty of it too. If I lose $5,000,000 to a billionaire, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as if I lose maybe a couple hundred thousand to some guy that's like pretty broke.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       And now he goes out and buys a new fucking car with my money. And I'm just like this fucking guy, you know what I mean? Like, oh, that's weird. I don't know why and it, and it's, it's kind of counterintuitive, you know. But another thing about it is like if you lose money to a guy that has a bunch, like you always think that, you know, there's a chance you could win it back to. So there's that piece of it. Um, if you lose money to a guy that doesn't really have much and he goes out and spends it will like, you're never getting it back again. Um, yeah, that exists in pool. Like a lot of guys don't want to gamble with guys only have one barrel. Go play your game pool for 100 bucks, but he's only got 100 bucks, but they might have 10,000.

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       Exactly. So you look at your upside, it's like, okay, best case scenario, walk away from this with this guy's last hundred bucks, which to me, some guys get off on that. To me, I don't really ever want to break a guy. Right? But then you look at the d, The downswing of that is like, okay, I could spend 10,000 trying to chase my initial hundred bucks that I lost. So you have to take that. There's just a lot of things in gambling that you've taken to account, you know, with the, with the money management, psychological things. Yeah. So how did you make your money then playing poker? He made it all playing poker. Yeah. Wow. That is insane. So what did you do for a living before you played poker? I mean, I was in the military for four years. Um, and when I got out, got honorable discharge, I had, you know, uh, I was getting some disability money from the va just because I, you know, I got a lot of injuries when I was going through buds and, and just not even just injury, just all the medical checks they do, they just document all the things that are wrong with you so you get a percentage for all those things.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       Kind of Shit was wrong with you. Fuck, I mean, I first time I went in and I had a bilateral stress fractures so I was, you know, went into bugs, have broken legs and so I was eating a bunch of motor and it burned a hole in my stomach. I had acid reflux. They ended up getting so bad they were actually going to kick me out of the navy, gone through buds with broken legs first I went in. Yeah. And nobody knew that lecture sore. Well no I got medically dropped the first. So I mean it's kind of a long story, but I'll try and give you the cliff notes. Um, so I went to bootcamp and the furthest I'd ever ran was like two miles and it was straight out of high school because I got thrown in jail, um, my senior year of high school.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       So I didn't graduate and get your ged. Um, and kids you don't need a degree. Slim how to play poker. Well we'll get to that. So, um, end up joining the military, go go through bootcamp in a school. I was trying to ramp up. So I'm like, fuck, I'm going to seal training. I gotta I gotta start running. So I started running, I got an overuse injury, turned into stress fracture a. They basically put me on a medical hold and my detailer said, look, you can stay on this medical hold through, your legs are healed and then I'm going to send you to a ship for two years and then you can apply or else you can get cleared and go straight to seal training. So I was like, okay, got cleared. When seal training, they dropped me the first day I had to request to talk to the captain and finally the captain's like, okay, you know, I'll let you, I'll let you try it because I basically said, look, just give me a shot.

Speaker 3:          00:29:51       I'm already here. Like, let me just train. Um, what's the worst that can happen? I'm not going to die and you know, break the leg worse. So I said, if I make it through hell week, just give him medical role. He's like, yeah, sure kid, go ahead. So the guy let me train. Um, that was actually first bet I made my doctor who was like a Vietnam seal. He's like, he was so fucking pissed that the c CEO allowed me to train. And so he's like, I'll bet you a hundred bucks you don't make it through hell week is 100 bucks or 20 bucks, I forget which, but I bet the guy and I won the fucking money. Um, and three weeks after I was just, I mean I could barely walk, you know, so I ended up getting enrolled and they kicked me out.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       Um, and so I went to my ship and the ship was like, the captain of the ship wants to take me out to see even though it's supposed to be on crutches. So I was like, this motherfucker. So after, after going through like the hardest thing and then getting dropped, um, now I'm on a boat and I was supposed to be like healing up and this guy wants to take me out at sea. So go to Okinawa. And I requested to go in to see my wisdom teeth. And then when I was there I was like, hey, you know, check my legs and like, okay, we'll do a nuclear bone scan. So when I was supposed to go in from an they said, you know, come back in two hours. So I went for a two hour run and in just like my fucking, not even like my, uh, fatigues.

Speaker 3:          00:31:09       It was like a work uniform. It was like a button down shirt. I wear a two hour run, took a shower, came back and he looked at my legs and I'm like, your legs are fucking destroyed. Like I can't believe you can walk. I'm like, yeah, these motherfuckers, you know, and so they're gonna kick me out of the navy. So it just like that was thing I was going to get medically discharged from the navy and it took them so long that I actually requested to go back and I just, I'll never forget because I went in and talked to the CEO of my, it was like a limited duty security detail or whatever. And he goes, let me get this straight. He goes, you're about to be medically retired from the military. He goes for broken legs and you want me to request or approval requests for you to go to seal training.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       He goes, how fucking stupid are you? And I was just like, and I didn't really know what to say. I was or you know, this is just like, he's like, get the fuck out of my office. And I was like, thinking about it, I was like, well fuck, like I, you know, I'm like, he'll have been doing steroids. I feel great, but fucking working out like, well it's been like eight months, right? Like I feel like I could go do this again. So I ended up pulling some strings and uh, and basically I just had to get cleared and then I had to pray that I got sent to buds because if not it'll go to a ship. And then I had to. It was just like, it would be the biggest disaster of all time. So that was one of my biggest gambles was doing that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:30       I'd like a free ride for the rest of my life medically retired. Like, you know, I'm a disabled veteran, like, you know, all this great shit and I kinda like gave it up to go back. And um, uh, yeah, I went into his office and he goes, he goes, he goes, you might be the stupidest motherfucker I've ever seen. He goes, he goes, he goes, you just better hope that you don't end up back at this command. He could see goes, you're going to clean fucking toilets until you get discharged. And uh, yeah. So that was, how would they have discharge? How would they have paid you for life from broken links? I mean, Delta legs heal up and then you're okay. That's the thing is like, it just, it had been basically since it was documented because when I got out of um, bootcamp at a school, I had them and I had them all through buds.

Speaker 3:          00:33:18       Where is it broken? A bilateral tibial stress fracture. So my tip, um, and then that's the big one, right? The fibula is a smaller one. Those in the shins. I don't remember which, but I think it was the very one. Um, and then so all through bonds and then, you know, on the boat. So it was, it was basically like, you know, I had broken legs for like a year and a half or a year and seven months just insane. It was basically like, they're like, okay, well this guy's legs are just never going to fucking. He'll right. Like, that was kind of like the military, his take on it was like, okay, well he's been on limited duty like this and that, like his leg should have healed by now and they just aren't, so what are we going to do with them? So why wasn't it healing?

Speaker 3:          00:33:57       I'm still confused because I went through seal training that kind of fucked them up a little bit and then, you know, I was on the boat and I wasn't allowed to use crutches. And then I think obviously the final Straw was probably me fucking going on a two hour run on a purpose. Fuck yeah, I did it on purpose. Yeah. But what was the goal of fighting to get the fuck off the ship? I said, you know, this capital was such a dickhead. It's like Brah, I went through all this fucking pain, you know what I mean? Like I went through seal training, it's like letting my legs, you know, you fucking cock sucker. Like the guy like wanted me to like stand watches on the bus. It was like Kinda like, it's basically like a fuck you to him. So you crushed her own legs to get off the boat and then try to get into seal training.

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       Yeah, well it took them so long, you know, took them so long to process me out of the military that they had healed. And so I was like well fuck wow that's hilarious. So just from those broken links, you could have been set up where you've got a pension forever and not only that but like if you're a disabled veteran you get like a year eligible for a lot of shit, you know, if you're like medically retired, it's kind of like, you know, you went in the military, he tried to, you know, be in there forever and like you just got injured, you know what I mean? So they like make a lot of, you know, allowances for people like that. Like I think they give you like your first loan on your house for free. There's like a whole bunch of Shit, Huh? Yeah, I remember because I looked into it when I gave it all up.

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       So then what happens then? I'm so well then I went back into uh, into bugs or field training or whatever. Um, and I, uh, I made it two days before graduation and I got rolled all the way back the beginning and then I did the whole fucking thing again. And why did you get rolled all the way back to the beginning? So when I went through the second time I kind of had the attitude of just like, fuck, I've already done this shit and I just, you know, also, I don't know, I mean I was just in great shape and I just, I wasn't worried about anything. So my attitude was like, okay, well worst case scenario I'm just going to get beat and I don't really care. So I just would, I just figured if I passed everything and I performed well and I didn't quit, like they couldn't kick me out so I kinda didn't really like kiss ass or anything.

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       I was just like, whatever, like, you know, and if I fucked up it's like okay, I'll get beat. Like, you know, I was like pretty hard dude. I've been trained for two years, I'd already been through hell week and now I'm doing it without broken legs, you know, like going through with broken legs now I'm like, he'll, I'm like fuck, you know, like nothing could be bad now. So it's like worth the worst that can happen. I'm, we get hypothermia or I'm going to have to do some pushups, like whatever. And so I just didn't really have a good attitude. I wasn't too worried about um, like the other guys in the class because I figured, you know, would lose Mosa. I mean started off with 239 guys and we came through hell week with like 34. My first class we started with 119 and we came through [inaudible] 17.

Speaker 3:          00:36:55       So you're like, you're going to lose most of these guys. I don't really. I don't know. I, I mean, I wasn't much of a team player. I just want to graduate, you know, so. So, but how they kick you back then? Well started, I got one safety violation, um, uh, for the instructor gave the wrong order. We're on the range and we're facing down range and he gave an about face and drop. So half the class just did with words, you know, we did the about face, we drop and now we're like pointing down range, right? So half the class got a safety violation for that. And then the second one was we were doing I ads like these a live fire drills and half the classes behind the berm, the other half was doing it and then we switched and I was behind the berm and my, off my own berm was like a big mound of dirt.

Speaker 3:          00:37:42       And My, uh, the officer in charge of my class, he didn't really like me. So he had me on watch every single night and he put me on the Middle Watch. So out on the island, um, you get six hours of sleep Max if you fall asleep when you get off and then you wake up the second and you don't clean any of your gear, you get six hours. So he put me on us on a watch in the middle, so I got maybe like an hour in the beginning and then I just wake up for two hours for the watch and then maybe if I could go back to bed I'd get like an hour, maybe two hours asleep. So I was running on real low sleep and um, so I was behind the Berman. I just, you know, I fell asleep. It wasn't a big deal. Most guys did. But my crew leader didn't wake me up because he didn't like me.

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       So now I'm technically sleeping during a live fire drill because they did a class muster up fucking sleeping as the guns going off. And you're sleeping. Yeah, I mean the other guys did too. Yeah. I mean we're just like, we're sitting there because it, it, you know, it's like 40 minutes something. They're doing their shit and we're just laying there, we're not doing it. We're not supposed to be involved or you know, were just, they could only have half the class in the range. So half is just sitting there and then the other half is doing it and fuck man. Like, I mean, dude, during hell week I fell asleep standing up, you know. So it's like, yeah, you get tired enough, you fall asleep like no matter what. So. So you came out of that. So yes, I got rolled all the way back.

Speaker 3:          00:38:58       So, so basically they put me in front of the thing and, and uh, and they're like, well you got to safety violations, whatever. And I was just like, you know, I was like, well, I didn't really even explain. I didn't even really like at the time you're so brainwashed that these guys are like gods. You don't even really want to argue with them because they instructors. It's like you can't even like have a conversation with these guys because I've asked you a question. Like, your answers are like, who you are. Like you don't even say yes or no. It's just like a, you know, so you're so like conditioned to not argue that I didn't really like defend what happened, you know, because if I were to like walk in there and like defended like exactly like look, like half the class, you know, just given the explanation, but I didn't really want to like argue with these instructors because you're just so brainwashed.

Speaker 3:          00:39:38       Anyways. So I basically told him, I said, look, you know, I don't care. I'll go do the whole fucking thing again. And they're like, oh yeah. I was like, yeah. I was like, oh, I'll do the whole fucking course again. So they rolled me all the way back and did the whole fucking thing again. And uh, and this instructor that didn't like me, he just, he couldn't even find excuses. The third time he just, admin dropped me. I didn't even know that was a good thing. I didn't know you could get admin drop, but yeah, I just cut

Speaker 4:          00:40:03       it, made it all the way through. Any admin dropped. You haven't driven the stocks, your instagram page right now? I don't know, but I think he remembers. You have

Speaker 3:          00:40:11       probably, probably, yeah, I mean he's probably heard of me now. I mean the seal community is definitely love or hate with me, like you know, the guys that know me usually, you know, have good things to say and the guys that don't usually all talk shit but.

Speaker 4:          00:40:24       So you get out and then what happened?

Speaker 3:          00:40:28       So I get out. I'm a diva for years. Got Out and um, I uh, I went to college. When did you, and did four years there and uh,

Speaker 4:          00:40:38       my brother was like the military too. It did four years. Paid my dues. I prison. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       no it was, it was fun. I had a great time in college. My brother taught me how to play poker. I'm like the first year because I was getting all this money from the Va and the Gi bill and I got grants. I was eligible for everything. Right. So that's what you learn how to play poker. Yeah. My brother taught me and then I was planning college is playing, like some online stuff. I had a couple of fraternity brothers that were really into it and they taught me a little bit and there's some home games and yeah, that's, that's how I started. I went broke, um, my sophomore year, so I was just like, it was a, it was a wild ride. I just sell some guns that went and played on a gambling boat for like a week and turned like this. I sold three guns for 750 bucks, played on this gambling boat for a week, turned into 10,000, went to Vegas and then turn that into 187,000 at Bellagio after playing for three weeks straight.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Never forget it. Wow. So that was the launching point. One hundred and 87,000 at the Bellagio. Bellagio created Dan Bilzerian essentially. Yeah. Yeah. Well they started it. So there you go and you just become this crazy baller poker player character. Well, I mean it was a, it was a slow rise, you know, I mean, it wasn't. How long did it take? Oh, I mean, you know, that was, I was,

Speaker 3:          00:42:01       that was 2005. You know, and I actually, I mean I got really lucky I came into poker at a time when nobody really knew how to play this fucking guy, Chris moneymaker, um, you know, he turned $25 into like a two or $3,000,000 win and he wasn't even that great. So it was like the new gold rush, like everybody wanted to play poker rounders had just come out, you know, that's what it was fucking movie. I remember that. It was that, you know, celebrity started playing and it was just like, it was one of those things were and there wasn't really any like training tools like the game hadn't been solved. Like even the pros weren't that good back then. So really? Yeah, I mean there wasn't, it was just kinda like, I mean back in the day, like the old pros, the way they won, they just cheated, you know? Really. Yeah. I mean there was a cheat. Oh fuck. I mean there's more cards, there's cold backs, there's a million ways.

Speaker 5:          00:42:50       I've never played poker. I mean I might've played once in high school or something like that. I've never played my friend Ari, Ari Shaffir, he when he was struggling in Hollywood, when he, he's, he's a stand up comedian and when he wasn't, was just starting out, he would make his money playing poker, go to poker tournaments, and he made way more money playing poker than he ever did. Doing standup.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       Yeah. Actually, I mean I'll tell you the story of how I dropped out of college. Can I piss real quick? Good.

Speaker 5:          00:43:14       No worries man. One Sec. Go ahead. Right here. So I drank a bunch of water. I just want to point out Dan Bilzerian and I wear the same pants both wearing camo pants. I think he deserves it more than me though. He went to hell week. I've just hidden from animals three times, but my pants are a. they're fake. I mean I just bought them on Amazon. They're not like, they're not like real cammo either. It's something like, cool. You are first light or anything. What a fucking character though. Huh? That's crazy shit. Right? Like a lot of people hate on that dude ever. I've met him a couple of times and it's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this one. It seems like a super nice guy, but every time I've talked to people about them, there was a food third good food, good food. The course, of course. I mean, he's like all. I mean the fact he's not paying those girls that I find that suspicious. Do you find that suspicious? We don't. Not really. I mean, why are they there then? Because they can get. They don't have shit to do. Don't they have jobs? They're hot. Probably he loans the money.

Speaker 5:          00:44:19       Let's leave some cash around. Can Be. Doesn't sure. They're getting good gigs out of it. I'm sure they're getting good gigs out of it. I mean, look what the fuck's that guy's named Corey Feldman. He's Feldman's angels or whatever the fuck that is. Right? Hugh hefner had this. The halfs have like show for awhile. Well, the he had to pay. Those girls were talking about a haffner. They're all playing. Maybe that was, that was sad to me. That was more sad to me. Was that the Haffner thing? Like, uh, I could see chicks to bang you. Handsome guy, thick beard, built no military man, got a lot of guns. That makes sense. The after thing was always like, oh, those poor girls, I have daughters and I would, I would think about some poor girl and Hugh hefner and just going, oh

Speaker 2:          00:45:08       yeah, but it's not just him. It's Kinda like all these fashion guys. Fashion guys. Yeah. Like, I mean, you know, Paul Marsianno, he bangs every check this and gas, you know. Oh yeah, okay. Yeah. So I mean it's Kinda like they set it up, right? Like, I mean, my whole thing is kind of like life setup, right? So you set up your life to where you don't really have to work for what you want, right. So, um, you know, push for instance, like if you set it up correctly, like I mean if you buy a big brand or a modeling agency or whatever it is, and you're providing these girls with a career, like for instance, let's, let's use Hugh Hugh hefner. So if you become a playmate, you're guaranteed $25,000. Um, you now you're, I mean this is back in the day, right, there's like, you know, 10 years ago and playboy was hot or you know, 20, whatever, whatever, so now they're getting a thousand dollars for appearance before they were getting, you know, whatever, but now they won't, you know, you can't even show up for less than a grand through your guaranteed more money there.

Speaker 2:          00:46:07       Now you have a title, um, as far as modeling, like you're just going to book higher end jobs. There's, you know, there's the playboy events, so it's Kinda like, you know, it's like you fuck this guy, he'd be home playmate and now you like have a career.

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       Oh, I get it. It makes sense and I mean it makes sense, but the factor that's missing is the fact that you were talking about before, like you're not really into fucking girls that aren't into you, you know, that's completely out of the downside of the question. Yeah. When you're a skeleton,

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       you. Oh yeah, yeah. When you're a scale. Yeah. But I mean, when you're a skeleton, like what are you going to do

Speaker 5:          00:46:40       your ball and you just take molly and fucking throw down those Viagra is get the party started. Who gives a shit? Throw that money out. You can't spend it when you're dead.

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       Yeah. What up 70. I'm probably going to be less picky, you know, so. Oh yeah, for sure. But I mean, like I said, it's, it's you go for a hot 50 year old, but you know, who knows, some of those girls might be into it because he's, you know, he's iconic and you know, fuck a celebrity thing. Celebrity is another crazy thing. I mean I've, I've said it to my buddy, I'm like, money maybe brings five or 10 x girls, like if you use it and I'm going to talk about using it in the sense of just paying them saying like set up your life to where they're given a nice life and there's cool shit going on. Parties, whatever. And then the fame I think, I think it's like a hundred X. I think it's like a hundred times. Well you, it's very

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       interesting because you're a guy that's just come into this just a few years ago, four years ago, you know, so you were already a man in his thirties and all this happened and then boom, you become famous. So you've got a good perspective on it, you know, I think for people looking at it on the outside, like I don't think any of us could understand what it'd be like to be drake. You know, I've heard that drake has parties at his house. I know dude who lives near Drake and he complains about the fucking parties and the parties are so crazy that the neighbor complaints at drake bought his house drinks like, fuck it, I'll just buy your house, man. He has girls. They meet at one place, then they get in a bus and then the bus comes to drake's house. Now he's, he's got it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       Yeah. He's definitely has it on the level. Super Baldwin for Super Bowl and you, you know me, I'm fucking saddled down. I'm married. I've got kids. I've got daughters too. Dude. I see all this stuff I have to watch from afar and go, wow, look at this action with all this craziness happening, look at this. Wildlife just had a completely different kind of life. But to um, to be a guy like you, it's very interesting because not only are you're famous, you're famous in a, like a really confusing way. You're famous just for being a baller, like 100 percent. Like it's Kinda crazy. I didn't write a book. You're not in any movies, you don't sing any songs. You're not telling jokes. You just balling out of control your ball and so hard that you become famous. You way more famous than me. I mean, what did you say you have? How many instagram followers you got? What is it? Nineteen 18. I think the total is 31. One point five on instagram. I have a two one on twitter. I've been on TV for 20 fucking years. It's funny man. It's an interesting kind of fame. It's a very different kind of fame.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Yeah, I mean I just remember, I remember when it Kinda hit me because I was in

Speaker 6:          00:49:26       can and I

Speaker 2:          00:49:31       was over there and this, you know, this is, this is France and then they don't only speak English a lot of these places

Speaker 6:          00:49:36       and I mean

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       I think what was I fuck 16 girls and it's 12 days and I remember because I fucked a girl without talking to her and that was when I talked to her. Yeah, because she didn't speak English and they're. And I also like, I just kinda like wanted to like just see if I could do it, you know, I just like wanted to see if I could actually have sex with a girl without speaking to her at all. It was kind of awkward because like there's Times that I wanted to say something or like there was a question asked or whatever, like, you know, or it was like in the middle of sex, like norma, like I'll say you have to talk dirty or something. But like I made a point to be a fucking mute. Right. And I actually like pull it off and I was like, wow, like this shit is real, you know, and, and, and, and, and the time that I really saw it as a.

Speaker 2:          00:50:19       sorry, let me, it was, it was, I mean, I was in Canada. Is before the, the no talking thing. I was at some restaurant and raw Ron Perlman's manager came over to me and he's the actor. Yeah. Sons of anarchy. Yeah. Hellboy in hell, that's a real shit, you know, he's a real dude. So he come over and he's telling me about this new movie that he wants to do and there's like a, um, there's a dad and there's a son or grandfather's grandfather, son and dad and they're all, they're all in the military in different wars. And he was talking to me about maybe playing the son and, and we're having, you know, and I was interested in it because I'd done a little bit of acting up until then. And so it was like, you know, kind of, you know, trying to, you know, check it out.

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       And so I remember it was like every 30 seconds or minutes somebody would come up and ask you for a picture and after like the 20th person, somebody came up and was like, oh Ron, like, you know, I love a picture with you and I'll never forget it. I'll never forget for the rest of my life. He stood up and he goes, oh, you want a picture of me? Like, who the fuck am I? You sure you don't want a picture of this guy? And he was kidding. But I was just like, I was like, wow, like this is so fucking crazy. Now here's a guy that's like, you know, a super successful actor has been like, you know, big like tv series and like all these people are asking to take a picture with me. And I was just like, wow, like this is so fucked up. But it was real. I was just like, wow, this is like a real thing. This isn't just like numbers on the Internet. This is like I'm in a foreign country and I got all these fucking people coming up. I was, I was kinda like, I was dumbfounded. Have you ever

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       read that thoreau quote? Most men live lives of quiet desperation.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       Yeah, actually quoted that in one of my pictures. Oh, that's a great quote. The massive men or something along the lines of the mass of men lead lives of quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:52:06       Something along those lines. That quote, fucking died. Love that quote. That's got a lot of great ones. He's a brilliant, brilliant guy, but that quote is that one of the reasons why I think your instagram and everything is so popular is because there's a lot of people out there that are stuck in cubicles or they're stuck in jobs that they don't want to be there. They don't want to be doing what they're doing. They're looking at the resources. They're so small, they're tired all the time. They get done from work. They don't have any energy to do anything else. They're saddled down with some relationship is probably not optimal to getting yelled at the fucking. It's not going well. It's not going well. There's not a lot of joy. And then they go on your instagram and your fucking jet skiing and lake mead and so all the, you know, shooting guns and your underwear and it's like, it's. So it looks so fun, you know? And

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       yeah, I mean I try and be authentic, you know, another one of his quotes, you know, rather than love rather than fame rather than money Gimme truth. And I liked that to have all those though. Look, you got it all. You got to truth. You've got fame. We got drugs, heroin and la.

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       Well it is, it is rare because it's difficult to pull off because most people are not really comfortable with who they are. So instead of, you know, instead of fixing that, they just kinda pretend you know, and like, look, that's what politics is. That's what a business is. When you put that fucking stupid tie on and he got those slippery shoes with the tassels on them and pretending that you really talk like that. You know, when you're talking about dividends and making them know that we can make this work and let's touch base on Monday and way. Great to talk to you and like shut the fuck up

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       or correctness, the fucking pleasant trees that just the bullshit, you know, that's what I wanted to just kind of

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       get rid of. I had a conversation with someone about, you know, people that have a lot of money and ballers and someone goes, uh Oh, that seems like such an empty life. And I don't know if we were talking about you specifically, but you're like a perfect example of it. I'm like, but here's my point. I'm defending you. I'm like, what's empty about? It looks like he's having fun. Like, what's so great about showing up to an insurance company every day and putting in your work like, yeah, look, it's very admirable to provide for your family. It's very admirable to put in hard work when you don't want to and get it done. But there's nothing wrong with figuring out a way to not do that either. You know? Just because you got stuck in some sort of a weird situation where you have to fucking grind it out at some lumber yard every day.

Speaker 1:          00:54:29       Doesn't mean that a guy like you who's just got some crazy life that he's lived and where he figured out a way to make a bunch of money, gambling poker, playing card games like that's not, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Like I look at all your shit. I don't see any victims. I don't see anything wrong. I see you having a bunch of fun and I see a bunch of girls that are laughing. They seem to be having a bunch of fun. You're flying to Italy, you're doing all this crazy shit. I don't see anything wrong but yet people get mad and people hate. And when I have conversations with people and Mike, what is shallow about all these experiences? Like what is, what is so awful?

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       Yeah. I mean, and a lot of girls have really benefited, you know, build some careers. Like, you know, Lindsay polyps. When I started dating her, she had a 100,000 followers. She bumped up the one point $6 million and three weeks and now this chick's making poor $500,000 a year posting pictures on instagram and snapchat. I mean, just just think about that for a second, like she's making four times as much as a doctor or a lawyer when they get out of college and, and, and forget about all their debt that they have, you know, let's just say they come out of college with no debt. She's still making five times more money than them at four years younger.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       Well also the amount of fucking time they have to spend if you're a doctor or a lawyer, not just going through medical school, not just going through your residency but working, constantly working and she's got a post, a couple pictures. Sit on a couch, post a few pictures. She stuck her by t her ass up in the air. High heels. Ooh. It's beautiful world. The world of social media is a fascinating world man because like speaking for me personally as a, as a comedian before social media, I used to have to do so much work. I used to have to get up early in the morning and do radio shows before gigs. I used to have to do morning TV. You'd have to do interviews with, you know, I do an interview with some newspaper reporter if that guy did not want to fucking talk to me and give a shit about me and try to have fun with it and maybe he would try to have fun with it, but for the most part it was nonsense. You don't have to do any of that anymore. Social media,

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       it's just pure uh, access and it's, it's actually fucked it up honestly for a lot of these girls now because they don't want to go to the clubs. Like they don't need to go to parties and meet celebrities anymore. They could just dm him like, and then you have all these rich guys that are just having their, you know, their pussy coordinator, you know, message all these ordinator Oh, who has a court, was a pussy coordinator. Crazy Bro. You have no idea. Like now these girls are getting booked out there, getting paid $5,000, $10,000 to just go on a vacation. Some of them don't even have to sleep with any of the guys. I mean, it's just like,

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       that seems like you would never get anything done.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       Yeah, I mean, and, and, and from these girls' point of view, you can't really blame them and it's like, fuck, if I was one of these girls and I could travel the world on a private jet and do all this other crazy shit for free and it's just. I mean, I don't

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       blame them at all as long as long as nothing awful is happening. Yeah. I used to know this guy, we call him wild man. A buddy of mine used to work at a strip club. He was a DJ at a strip club and there was a guy there that apparently invented bell bottoms is a crazy story and he had lung cancer. He smoked cigarettes like packs and packs a day and no emphysema. And his doctor was telling him, listen man, you are going to fucking die if you don't stop smoking cigarettes. You're gonna fucking die. And he's like, I'm just addicted to smoking. It was like smoke joints. He's like, they're, they've shown in studies that smoking marijuana is not nearly as bad for you. And actually it might act as an expectorant it might help clean your lungs out even though it sounds contrary to, to logical thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:58:05       Just give it a try. So this guy starts smoking weed, like he would smoke cigarettes. You just roll in joint smoking. He would smoke like 15, 20 joints a day. And he would, when he pull up to the Strip club, he would give these guys like his roaches because there's roaches were like half done because he would smoke them, smoke cigarettes. The guy changes his entirely. He gets so high and he's so high all the time. He's like, I don't want to do any of these things that I'm doing anymore. He goes, this is one on one, do I want to play guitar? And I want a bank checks. And that's when he decides to do. He realizes he's like 60 years old and he's worth some shit, ton of money. And this was like right around when Viagra was invented. So this guy goes on a rampage and he's.

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       But he's mean, he's like really nasty. And he did what he would call mad dog in these chicks. So He'd bring them back to his house and he would say nasty shit to him and hit him and piss on him and all kinds of crazy shit. Apparently, I don't know the full details of it, but his house was for sale and he had this ball baller house in the Hollywood hills and for awhile I was thinking because I go to the comedy store all the time, I'm like, man, maybe I should buy this fucking house. It's like it's close to the comedy store, but I'm like, God, it's like this $5,000,000 house. It's right on the street. It's right there. Like you could use the sidewalk and then here's his door. Like you just touch his door and like someone's gonna fucking break into this guy's house.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       And so the realtor is like, no, listen, there's a state of the art security system in this place. It's got all these cameras. I go, yeah, you know what that camera's going to get. It's going to get a picture of a dude with a ski mask robbing your fucking house. Like, do you understand that? Like what is, what is a camera going to do? Like how's it going? Two weeks after I said that the dude got shot in the neck, in the fucking house he brought. He used to bring the hookers to his house. He used to bring them to his house and he brought one to his house and she brought her boyfriend and they shot him in the neck. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of setup, stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. But. So they see that's a bad guy. That was a guy doing bad shit. I don't see anything wrong with anything you're doing. I see. I see happiness. I look at your instagram. I see a bunch of people laughing. I liked the music you're playing. You're playing

Speaker 3:          01:00:08       songs that I would listen to. It looks like a fucking party. Nothing wrong here. People need to relax. Yeah, I mean I'm just know doing some wish. Fulfillment. Now, do you have like, do you have a like a plan, chart it out for this existence? Are you just winging it? Well, I got this APP coming out, um, where it's going to be kind of similar to like what World Star does, where you can, users can upload, you know, they're bad ass videos, right. So anything kind of like, you know, similar to the stuff that I post or you know, fights or whatever crazy cool videos that they want they can post on there and you know, I'll just share the best ones on my facebook or instagram or whatever. So they're, you know, if they post cool shit on there, they're guaranteed to get, you know, a view on a shine.

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Yeah. And that's why they post on Worldstar, you know, because they want people to see it. So I'm, I'm, you know, I'm going to do that. I got this, a fantasy betting app that I got a, it's a, you know, it's like similar to the draft kings of the fantasy sports stuff. Um, I know just, you know, I've been focusing more on doing some stuff like that. I've Kinda just done everything I wanted to do, you know, and you know, as far as like the partying and shit, you know, so. Well that's why I was asking him like, well how much more can you do, you know? Yeah. I mean I've checked most of the boxes man. So now I kinda just want to give people a platform to how much money have you made playing poker? I don't know. I mean if you had to guess in the neighborhood. I mean, I know, I mean I, you know, I just know the big figures, right?

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       You know, it'd be one guy for $54 million. I mean I won 10 and a half and another night I've been another guy for 10 and then you know, I don't know what the total is on the other cash games but you know, I dunno, I know made a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:02:07       But do you have enough stashed away?

Speaker 3:          01:02:09       That was, that was just an, you know, a six month or a year period.

Speaker 2:          01:02:12       So it's like a, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:02:14       Did you take a chunk and put it away and say, okay, this is my break glass in case of apocalypse fund.

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       Oh good. I've bought bathrooms goal then, you know, and I, and I own my stuff, my plan and my house and my car. Then I cash in the bank. I'm doing all.

Speaker 5:          01:02:33       Yeah, but I mean this, like this. First of all, that's crazy, right? It's crazy that you went from being a navy seal to being a college student who's learning to play cards, you know, preparing or trying to attempt to be a navy seal, going to college and learn how to play cards to a guy who's got his own fucking jet. Got It all from gambling. I mean, that's, that's, that's bizarre in and of itself. But do you ever think like there's a time where I'm not going to want to do this anymore?

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       Yeah, I mean, I'm, you know, I'm kind of at the point, like I said, where I've done most of the stuff that I wanted to do. Um, so now I'm just, I'm kind of winging it. I've been doing more active stuff. I've been doing, uh, like some wake surfing and we went out to Lake Powell and um, you know, winter's coming up and doing some snowboarding trips. Snowmobile and just more fun. Yeah, just haven't bombed but doing like more active stuff. Less party and mean self, the girls around. But um, yeah, I mean I got, I did a cartoon. It's a, I'm about to,

Speaker 5:          01:03:35       didn't you have two heart attacks and like one night or something. That's actually one of the cartoon episodes happen. How did you have to. Hard to get out the car theater. Do you have the cartoon? Watch it, throw the Cartena how do we, how do we get to it until Jamie gets A. Yeah, I'm sure you could drop a day, Jamie, or do you have it on your phone? Is that what it is? It's on my phone. Oh, can you, can you airdrop it to you? Jamie? Does that work? Uh, I can't airdrop it, but I can airplay it if you've got an apple TV. We have an apple tv but we can't play it online vs watching it in here. We can hear it or anything. I can't put it on that. You can, but I don't have that. That's not the system here.

Speaker 5:          01:04:13       It's not built into this display. Um, let me see. Can we fix that? Can we make that happen or is that we can in the future, but we need a different setup or something. I need some extra inputs. Yeah, we'll do it another time. I'm going to call my guy and see if I can get you a link you want to give me. Give me one second. Yeah, yeah. Good. Call Your Guy Dan Bilzerian, but we'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, he's gonna. Call his guy. Not to be confused with this pussy coordinator. He doesn't have one of those. Are you looking for pussy coordinator? I know some dudes look crazy. Life Bizarre, right? I just, you know, people, people will tell you that's going to get tired. We guess what? So it was being married to a lot of people, not to me. Jamie. So is working in a regular job that's got to be tired too.

Speaker 5:          01:05:09       I love the fact that this is a real thing that all of a sudden because of social media, some guy can gather up 50 million followers, be continent, I don't know how to word this right? But like, you know, people start calling the Michael Jordan. You'd be the Michael Jordan of this because you're the greatest of whatever he's starting to become. People are calling so and so the Dan Bilzerian of, of X. Oh yeah, well that becomes so intense that Italian guy, juvenile vaccine, the, Oh, that old guy is my age. Isn't that sad? God Damn, I'm old. Pro Sad. Every now and then I wake up and I got some new pain and uh, I just think it's this pain like forever is this going to heal here, this hip thing that's going on lately? And it's not bad. Like I did kickboxing today and no problem, no pain while I'm working out, but every now and then it irritates me and instead of it, like when I was young, if I had something that irritated me, I would say, Eh, some fucking nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       I'll get over that. But that's also why I developed a bunch of chronic injuries from Jujitsu because I would go and train even though it had something fucked up. It's also because Jujitsu is really fun, but I don't think like that anymore. Man. Now I think, is this like broken? Like is this, am I going to need a hip replacement? Like I know guys that are my age that if a fucking. I know guys younger than me that have had hip replacements. I started thinking like, is this shit broken forever? You got your guy. I talked to him. He's telling me I can't. I can't show it. You can't always tell who the fuck is that guy. So you've got a guide that tells you what to do. Saying, dude, I'm available. I worked for free. Pretty much fire them all. I have a team to. I don't listen to them either.

Speaker 5:          01:06:57       Nobody should listen to teams. I mean, I obviously don't know shit about poker. I don't know nothing about your business. I'm not a Gambler, but I can advise you. Fire the whole to fire everybody. Keep doing exactly what you're doing. Listen to me, dude. I'm telling them right. I have no experience in your business. I'm totally unqualified, but I will give you a, some sound advice. Yeah. Um, you know, that Italian guy that people keep comparing to you, the guy who dances around a lot. Oh, seeing them. Yeah. Some health issue. What's going on? Really? I thought so, but I don't know if that was the last I had heard. Oh, I didn't hear that. What's his name? Giovanni vaccine or something like that. Why I became aware of him because it was a hilarious video of him and his girlfriend dancing. Oh yeah. That's great.

Speaker 5:          01:07:41       Really good. Fucking great. But this thing, here's the thing man.

He at with levels yet $5 million. How many giant jump. He's done

Speaker 2:          01:08:43       twice as many posts as I've done in the last five years and he's done it and I think like six bucks.

Speaker 5:          01:08:49       Yeah, very quickly. Say he's posting a lot. Well not only that, his shit became a really popular like really recently, like I want to say when I became aware of them, we only have 2 million followers, but like if you look at his stuff though, it Kinda looks like, you know, like a lot of photo shoots. Right, exactly. How it looks like a lot of stage. Oh look, I found a goat. Yeah, look, it's me with the goat. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's got a lot of money. Look at that. Come on. So that doesn't just accidentally happened, right? Yeah. You don't just accidentally get photographed on a horse with no shirt on. White with prison tattoos. What's what? All the prison tattoos got like a bunch of writing on his chest. Was that all say? Do we notice tattoos? Say there must be like a website dedicated to his chest.

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       Tattoos. Look, he's there with pit bull. Look, there he is. Come on. He's so happy now. I mean it looks great. It looks like a cool cat. He does what? He's doing his beard though. That little thing that he puts at the bottom of his beard. He twists it up and puts like a little rubber band around it. Get the fuck Outta here. Fuck. That is. I will pull that thing off. I see you sir. I'm going to grab that thing. That's Goddamn handle. I don't understand that. Yeah, he's A. He's a fun cat though. His videos are really fun.

Speaker 2:          01:10:00       No, the fucking guy can dance.

Speaker 5:          01:10:03       Oh Man. Did she pulled it? See if you can find that one video of him with the girl. The first one they did on the boat that got them really famous. I want to say that was only four or five months ago and I've really

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       in the last like five months he's really like, he's gone hard like. But there's some stuff. I mean it's like he set up a dinner table. I saw a picture. He set up a dinner table underwater where he could like pretend like he was eating under water and then he did like a whole, like a whole skit where he was like, underwater doing all this. I'm like, fuck man, that must have taken you like fucking full day. Like he's wearing a suit.

Speaker 5:          01:10:42       Well, he's gone a different approach. Yeah. Instead of the baller approach, like shooting guns in his underwear, what he's doing is he's got like this one beautiful girlfriend. They just have a good time all over the world. It seems. I'm an, it's a, it's a different approach. But

Speaker 2:          01:10:56       here's the by like that. I did that.

Speaker 5:          01:10:58       Like this. That's it. No, that's awesome. I mean this mother fucker can dance. He can. He can fuck. And he looks like he's having a good time. Not One hundred percent

Speaker 2:          01:11:08       that, that, that, that, that. That's cool. To me. They're like the other stuff that's like, it seems like lot of effort put into

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       it is not, not quite, but that. That's dope. I mean chick seems cool, bumbling and dance. Looks like he's having fun. I mean like, listen, if you got that kind of money, why wouldn't you be dancing? She'd be dancing. Has Awesome. Should be partying. You're fucking. And he is just. I don't understand his tattoos. I'm confused about the ankle one. What's going on down there? Maybe it like his ex wife's name. Like fuck you. Bitch isn't good shape though. Yeah, he is. Fuck you. Yeah, he's in very good shape for 49 year old. That's my age. Goddammit. I'm fucking 49, man. It's just the end is near. Know you're in the right time timeframe. I'll tell you what it is. They got the stem cells. They got the hang of it all of, all the above. Oh yeah man. Stem cells fix my fucking shoulder.

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       Like people are tired of hearing about it. On this podcast, was that Regena kind or was that. I had regeneca and on my shoulder to help as much. I had some pretty significant tearing. I'm a slap tear. I had a tear of the, um, the labor room, a tear of the biceps tendon and a tear of the rotator cuff. I did the rotator cup. I basically, I couldn't even lift my arm like three inches. I did the REGENECA and then three weeks later I was boxing like, well Regina, Regina kind did wonders for my back. It just wasn't enough for my shoulder. Again. I'm an idiot. I don't give it enough time off. But uh, when I was, I, I mean I literally from like this, three weeks later I was boxing like, yeah, it is amazing. Aggressive, right? I mean, by all the doctors told me I needed surgery.

Speaker 1:          01:12:41       Same thing to me. Not that I've had that said to me twice. I need surgery on my neck and I've heard I need surgery on my shoulder. I avoided both of them and I do everything now, but one of the things about shoulder injuries that I've found from Steve Maxwell, he's a pretty famous, a strength and conditioning coach has been on this podcast a bunch of times, is a hanging hanging from Chin up bars. It's, it's so important to do. It's so good for your shoulders to straighten out your shoulders. You're going to say bad. I was like, fuck done. A lot of that, so it's really good for you. There's a whole video about it with his doctor who was a shoulder surgery doctor, stopped doing shoulder surgery on most of his patients and started them on this. This hanging therapy, because when you see most human human beings, essentially we're primates and most primates swing from trees.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       I mean that is what they do. They grab a hold of things and they swing and it stretches out your arm and you develop impingements from gravity from a lack of use or from too much use or overuse, and this guy has you hang from a chin up bar, just just holding on and hanging and it stretches out your shoulder and it alleviates pain in a giant percentage of people that have shoulder injuries and I urge anybody who's listening to this that has any sort of shoulder weirdness or some shit that fucks with them to just try this. I know it sounds crazy like how the fuck is hanging by your shoulders going to help you and this is one doctor that. This is not the doctor that invented the procedure, but he basically explains it really well. There's a bunch of them. What did you google so people can shoulder pain hanging from a bar and there's a lot of things that start popping up as there's a gang of it, but it's super effective.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       It's super effective for a lot of people. I mean if you have significant tearing where you're going to need surgery of a failure of your joint or something like that, you know, that's one thing. But for a lot of people this offers them a great deal of relief and it really helps me. I do it every day. It's one of the first things I do in the morning. I hang and then I do a scapular raises for archery. So I hang. I'll do like two minutes of hanging and then once I've done two minutes, then I just, I contract my scapula and I hold that in place for as long as I can. So it's like my hands are given out, my forms are given out and then I forced my scapula to carry all the weight. And you make it a daily routine. Just make it is what I do. I brush my teeth, I do that. I just have to do it. So I'm forcing myself. I have zero pain, zero pain in my shoulders. But the stem cells was a

Speaker 2:          01:15:08       factor. So now are you getting the infusion or are you getting the like how, how, how are you getting it? Like I said earlier? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       Um, well they, what they do is they take it from a woman, a young woman who's had a Sicilian section when they give birth through Assyrian section, they take the placenta and then they use that for stem cells and that apparently is the most powerful version of stem cell therapy. There's a bunch of different kinds of they use in this country that a lot of people, like a lot of people like it. When they take your fat out, they take your fat out and they convert that stem cells and I brought into that. But Daniel Cormier, they went into his hip. They got his marrow.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       Yeah. I got, I got a 19 year old bone marrow

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       from someone else. Okay. Daniel Cormier, they went into his own hip and pulled it out. But I've heard great results from a lot of different versions of stem cells. But I know for me personally, when they shot the stuff from placenta and in my shoulder, it was like within a couple of weeks it was better than it had been in a year. And then a few months after that I was like, no pain. It's amazing how quick it's healed. And also did a lot of shoulder exercises with rubber bands and stuff. A lot of different things that I concentrate on. I do all the time now to strengthen up the area and keep it tight. But you haven't done the, uh, the Ivs. So you did that? Huh? I've done that twice. Last route and did that. He told me that it was like he goes, it was like the power was coming out of my hands.

Speaker 2:          01:16:32       It's pretty crazy. I mean, I basically, it was weird though, the first time I did it, it seemed like I had a lot more profound effect on the second but the first time. So I went down to Mexico because you can't do it in the US. So I went down there and got like $90 million, uh, of the 19 year old bone marrow oxygen deprived or whatever, and they injected in you. Um, the next day I went to get some dental work done and they got a root canal or whatever it was, but they injected 25 vials of like lie to Canaan, Novacane and whatever it is. And they said that my body was just cycling through like instantaneously.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Right. So I had all this dental work done the next day I was completely healed from all the dental work, which is pretty crazy. Yeah. And they said they've never given anybody that much lighter cane ever. Um, even, you know, and, and, and they're like, you know, the guy asked me if I do coke and I'm like, no, like, I haven't done that since I was 25. He said, yeah, he's like, normally like nobody can, you know, needs this much unless they have some kind of a thing. And I'm like actually normally really drug sensitive. I also found that um, because I do a, uh, hrt and I found that when I did the shots like I, it was like a lot of people listening to hormone replacement therapy. Yeah. And um, and so basically I found that it just cycled all these drugs faster through my system so I'd get a stronger effect but then it be out.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       Um, and then I went to the gym. They said you're not supposed to work out for three days or whatever. I went to the gym, I think it was like four or five days later and I was like 20, I think 20 percent stronger and I mean I've been training for 20 something years of done everything. So to get like 20 percent strength in Greece is just fucking crazy. I'm going to Mexico. It was so part of Mexico. Where do you go? Exactly? I had an address Tijuana. He it so dangerous. It was like, it was like Mario had, I had like the armored cars. I like made them give me a machine gun. I was like, I had like a machine go, you want to your own machine going down there. She just, in case shit goes down. You don't want these guys to get shot that place like the wild west man, you know, at least I'm going out.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       I want to have a gun, you know, Tiwan, it seems to me like, yeah, it's the wild west, but they don't want to fuck it up because there's, the money's made all through tourism. Like if somebody gets gunned down or kidnap, nobody wants to go to Tijuana. So you rarely hear about anything going down in Tijuana except those drugs. Murders. Yeah. That was just the last ones with those beheadings which were, that was like a decade. Pretty gnarly shit. I, I mean, I, I just know that they didn't want me to fly my plane down there. I did anyways. But they're like, yeah, you should probably show and you know, there's probably drive you drive. Not that long. Uh, I don't know. Last time I went, I mean I hadn't been down there since the military, but she seemed like the border crossing going back just took forever.

Speaker 3:          01:19:18       It's a nightmare and now they want you to. I mean, I don't know, it just it back in the day it was easy. We used to walk across the license. Yeah, yeah. Driver. Yeah. That's. When did he make it a passport? Things Canada too, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well Canada has been like that, but Mexico I think you said not be like, or maybe Canada used to be licensed when I used to go to Montreal is to know you're right. You're right. You're right. Because I used to go fishing trips with. Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know how long ago it was, but they definitely uh, definitely changed a lot since you know, you don't want to get these injections, you just for no reason. I just want, I did it for no reason. Like, just like, fuck it, we only did it once and I did it twice. Twice. Yeah. But the second time I just felt like I just left. I actually went straight from burning man down there, um, and

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       uh, I only got 70 and I just, I dunno, I, I did a fast before, um, and I kinda like, I kinda got sick and then I took some antibiotics. They say you're not supposed to take antibiotics. I don't know, maybe I fucked it up. I'm not really sure, but I just remember the first time was a distinctly like super strong effect.

Speaker 4:          01:20:29       Yeah. Well I believe boss route and went to South America I think. Do you remember where he said he went? Jamie Peru. Did you say Peru?

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       Yeah, my buddy doesn't. Can Cue and I know they were doing it and determine a. yeah, I think just the door if I, you know, it's, it's all, it's just basically anywhere that is not the US I think.

Speaker 4:          01:20:45       Yeah. Well we got fucked during the Bush administration when they did these sweeping ban on stem cells because the religious right and they went back. They don't want you to play God and you know, it wasn't just that they were concerned. Stem cells were connected to fetal tissue and there was this whole idea that people are going to get abortions on purpose just to get the fetal tissue and cell this something. Yeah, and they probably would. I mean someone probably will. It probably wouldn't be a lot of people, but it'd be enough that it would be an issue with some folks, so because of that, all these European countries, especially Germany and got way ahead of the curve when it comes to stem cell research and applications in the medical industry and now what we're seeing now, you obviously know Regena. Keem was invented in Germany.

Speaker 4:          01:21:29       That's how I found out about it for a knee like fuck. I think it was 20 years ago or so. I'm crazy. I mean, do you know Mickey Rourke? I've met him twice. Tell him to settle down. Calm down, dude. It seemed like it seemed like a good guy. Just come down. He's a whatever you're doing. Don't do that anymore. Just just realize what a fucking actor though the wrath or was it like one of my favorite movies? Public Greenwich Village. Man. Let me go back to some old shit. Angel Heart. So bad motherfucker. I mean, it's good. I just, the rest of this seems so authentic. I Dunno. It's just uh, yeah, I just liked that movie. What was perfect for him at the time too, because he was an older guy and you know, and he was kind of fucked up. He let his own the part. He was perfect for it. Now, now he's a fucking amazing actor and people forget that because he's kind of a freak now. But if you go back to his earlier stuff and you see like how good he was in diner, you know what I mean? He's a fucking. He was amazing. He was amazing. But uh, yeah, whatever he's doing don't do that anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       But uh, I know Peyton manning went down there to Germany and um,

Speaker 2:          01:22:40       so now let me ask you, is that, is that stuff band in professional sports?

Speaker 4:          01:22:44       Red Regena keen? No, no, no, no, no, not the. Not the healing stuff. I'm talking about. Just like stem cell infusion. No, no, not yet. Oh Wow. But could be soon. You could

Speaker 2:          01:22:57       test for that. I mean, that's the thing, what I've been told is you cannot tell the difference between a regular, like a stem cell from you or a stem cell from me or whatever if been scrubbed and

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       your system. I mean, it's like they said to me as stem cells, the stem cells.

Speaker 1:          01:23:09       Well, um, I paid very close attention to the latest cutting edge research for doping [inaudible] the UFC. And because, uh, I'm friends with Jeff Novitsky who was the guy who busted Lance Armstrong, who's of course the guy who works for the UFC now and he and I talk all the time and it's really fucking interesting how these people who are trying to get ahead or like way they're way ahead of the people that are trying to detect it. So like now they're developing testosterone from animals, which is interesting because you're seeing people that are taking testosterone. It's exoticness testosterone, but it used to be that they were getting it from wild yams. So what they would do is they'd do carbon isotope tests and they would be able to detect that the testosterone inside of your body's not from a biological. It's not from an animal that testosterone is actually coming from a yam is a Mexican Wild Yam.

Speaker 1:          01:24:00       It's really interesting. Um, but now they're figuring out a way to extract it from animals at least theoretically. So Novitsky Levitsky says it like it hasn't been proven yet, but they're pretty sure. So what they're doing now is they're taking people's pis and blood and then they freeze it and they hold onto it for eight years. So the idea is that eight years from now they're going to find out like new detection methods and they're using those, the Olympics now, which is why two Russian Olympic gold medalist in wrestling got their metals taken away from 2008. Oh yeah. And they haven't even gone in 2012 yet. So there's 2000, 12, 2016. I mean there's, there's, these guys are going to get fucked over for sure. But you know, Russia has extensive state sponsored anti doping agency.

Speaker 5:          01:24:45       They also are pretty big advocates of. I mean they were the ones that started back to. Yeah, yeah. Well they started it. But also what's interesting is the scientists that were involved in the program, they all got whacked. They're killing these motherfuckers left and right. All the people that know when, when one guy blew the whistle, one of the Russian anti-doping guys blew the whistle and apparently they just started ice. And these motherfuckers see if you pull it up, Jamie, like how many Russian anti-doping scientists have been murdered? They don't fuck around over there and they don't fuck around. And like, and, and from what I've heard, like Putin is like really into sports too. So. Oh yeah, he's into fighting. Loves fader fade or million INCO. Yeah, whatever happened to that guy motherfucker time. Motherfucker. Time got him, you know. And Jesus got them, got super into Jesus. Oh really? Yeah. He uh, he changed, his body changed. Um, I dunno, it's indicative of his training methods. I've never really had much of a body on. It's always say Italy. It's so strange to be when you see guys like him or especially guys like country Nelson and this guy, like I just don't understand how you could train all the. It looked like, like it's like so crazy to me. Right? Like I know. Especially Roy, right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       Big country. Yeah. He wears it like a bag. A badge of courage too. I think Roy, if he just have really got super disciplined and lost a ton of way, he would be fighting at 185 pounds and you'd be knocking motherfuckers to. It'd be visible with that fucking chin. This guys, big crack. He's like, the big guys can't knock them out of the fucking little guys. Well unfortunately his chin started to fail him in recent years. A couple of in Mark Hunt knocked him out. It was just kinda like time. Right. But I'm just saying like, genetically the, I was blessed with the freakiest Chin of all time. Crazy. Right. So it's like. But I just, I never understood how you could train that much because, I mean obviously it's genetics, but I just remember, you know, when I was in the military like going through and I'll eat like pizza is audi butter.

Speaker 4:          01:26:49       I mean I was trying to like gain fat because it's so fucking cold in this water. I couldn't do it. Granted we were training more hours but like fuck, I don't know. I mean a lot of these, you know, UFC guys that I know, they train six hours a day and it was just like, I don't know what Roy eats, but it's not good. Whatever it is, it's most likely a lot of carbs, most likely he's just taken in a lot of sugar, a lot of carbs and his body doesn't know what to do with it and it just, he must just have a slow metabolism. Just, I don't know. I mean he certainly trains hard. He's got endurance. I mean, Roy doesn't gas out. I mean he gets tired like everybody else does, but it's not like a fatigue issue. She didn't know. What's crazy is.

Speaker 4:          01:27:26       I knew Roy way back in the day and Roy was known as being a really good grappler. He was a Brazilian Jujitsu competitor. I knew him before he ever did MMA and when he did mma, my thought was, oh, well, you're going to see some high level grappling from this guy. This guy's like a stud on the mat. Nope. Just started bombing on the ground. Yeah, hardly ever. Well, the one time we really see his Jujitsu was in the Andre Arlovski fight when he's fighting elite ECC, took our lawsky down. Hadn't been signed control, but elite not elite. ECC was. They were really corrupt and they had this weird thing where if you on the ground from whether 15 seconds it standing up, so he's on the ground inside control with a double double wrist lock going for memorial on Orlowski and they stand them up. Anyone up getting stopped by Orlowski.

Speaker 4:          01:28:11       But that was. But that was that. They were making Kimbo slice their, their poster boy, and it was like Gary Shaw was promoting and he was a boxing guy and he had his own idea about how to promote it and if they weren't mma friendly it was just, they wanted excitement. They didn't really want to promote like in a pure sense of the sport, you know, so it was a, the whole thing was kind of fucked. But I remember I saw Kimbo was down in Miami and I saw one of his fights or whatever and they had like some alternate gallic coming off the couch and this guidance document. Wait, seth petrus, len seconds. So that was a bad fight. They should have never taken that fight. Seth Petrocelli's very good. And when I saw that I had known that Kim Boses a tough guy. He was a really good guy to unfortunately he passed away recently. Just kind of fucked up because he had a bad heart and he was scheduled for another fight. They ever figured out what it was. It was just had heart disease, congenital heart defect,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       you know? I mean, I don't know if it was genetic, I don't know if it's something that happened along the way, I don't know, but he was a really good guy, like pretty much universally loved. Really good guy. His story is so crazy. I heard the guy that basically almost like walked onto the football team. Yeah. Yes. Living on the streets, like, yeah, I mean just a tough, tough guy knew how to punch and um, you know what, when I found out about him, I found out about them like everybody else did these youtube videos. Did you ever see when he fought Sean Gannon, Gannon was a cop. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah. The White Guy, right? Yeah. It's all big white guy. See if you find that in Sean Gannon versus Kimbo slice. They had a Dojo war and he was a cop in Massachusetts and uh, he got in trouble for beaten up Kimbo and like he got suspended I think from the police force.

Speaker 1:          01:29:56       Yeah, there he is right there. This is a crazy fight, man. They just had this one, this brawl in the middle of this Dojo. I think Kenny Florian was there and people were posted. This was a mixed martial arts.com, which is the greatest martial arts website on the Internet. Uh, back in the day. We all watch this shit live. I don't remember if we had to pay for it. It was streaming on some website or something like that as a of data, like an aeronautical number. This I definitely remember being like, fuck, this guy could fucking hodges oh yeah. Well we got tested, right? Yeah. This is what John Gannon is a tough motherfucker. I mean tough as hell. Long time cop real martial artists had a bunch of pro fights and uh, there was like all these discrepancies about the rules because he's got them in a standing guillotine and they're, they're trying to break it up and there's all, you got to let go and all this different shit.

Speaker 1:          01:30:47       So He lets go and then it winds up going to the ground like there was, it was all stacked against Gannon. Yeah. Because you know, they didn't want to get submitted and nobody wants to die. Right? Yeah. And you know, again has got ahold of this good team, he doesn't want to let it go and then Kimbo winds up getting them down on the ground. So then kimball's ground and pounded them see like this, this is supposed to be illegal to, you're not supposed to be able to do this. But gannon had a fucking head, like a fire hydrant and it just super game and great endurance. And so kimball is used to taking these guys out and he couldn't take in and out again and eventually beat him down and they had some crazy nonsense, like a 30 count. Like when he goes down, you count the 30 before you get back up, I'm not kidding. And he beat it once he beat it once. And then Gannon got him, knocked him down again. But like you could see Kimbo starting to get tired and that was the big thing. But. So he goes from this and then starts fighting in elite ECC and has some great fights. Man. Some really good fights that James Thompson. It was kind of controversial as well. But I knew him as like a pretty tough. I mean really tough, but as far as like professional skillset, you know, he wasn't like the elite level

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       and so when he fought Petros Lee, I was like, oh my God, he's going to get fucked up. Like this is a terrible fight for him. Petrocelli's like it's a world class fighter that happened real quick now. I remember I was. Yeah, it was like front row. So tell me about your heart attacks if you can't show me the video. Yeah. So basically, yeah, I, uh, I was, I think it was 25. I was on a ski trip. My fraternity brothers were in Park City, Utah Park City and we've just been partying. I, I, uh, I met this chick and the lyft line ended up getting her number and it went to the bar and I got like everybody shit faced. It was like 300 bucks, right? Cut the whole bar drunk. We're, you know, we're having fun. We go back to her house or banging until like seven in the morning or six in the morning and then I get a call, like I just showered.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       I was like, just started sleeping on my buddy's like, hey, it's the last fucking day. Like we're going like, let's ride. And I was just like, ah, fuck it. Alright, sure. So I took a shot and drink, have copied, got my shit on, went out. We shot of booze. Yeah. Shot of Tequila. Jesus Christ. Fuck. I mean, you know what I mean if you don't, if you keep drinking you don't get hung over. Right. So I was just like fuck it. So when wrote all day and then that night, I don't know, I don't know if it was like a stomach flu or what, but I was just like puke in and I just felt like shit and I just couldn't keep anything down. I remember I paid like the hotel guy like 100 bucks or getting a bunch of gatorades that couldn't even like leave my room.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       So next day go to the airport. When I knew that if I got nivea I'd feel better because I've like had some, you know, you know when you get dehydrated that's usually like the root of most of your problems. So I just like ended up buying an ivy from this medic because the guy's like, well if I hook this up to you, you know, like you're not gonna be able to fly. And I was like, dude, like, you know, I gave him a bunch of bullshit. I was gone, you know, fucking medic from the military and you know, this and that and I'm, you know, qualified to do that. Anyway, this guy ended up fucking salary. The bag basically just gave it to me. I hooked it up myself, like on the plane. And you haven't done this before? Yeah, we did it a couple times when we're in buds, like if we went out drinking or whatever and uh, and we had to train the next day or this is a commercial flight or a private flight?

Speaker 3:          01:34:10       Commercial. Yeah. So a pro commercial flight. You Hook up an IV bag? Yeah. Well in the bathroom, like, yeah, before I got on there. Right. So I go in the bathroom, like hooked this thing up, you know? Yeah. You ain't got to wait like an hour. Right. So I'm like, what else we're gonna do is I fucking hook this thing up. Start feeling better. Go to Vegas. How long did you let it drip in there? For? Probably 20 minutes. I was like, he just locked the bezirk in the bathroom and just. Yeah, just hooked it up and fucking bang on the door. Hey Dude, I'm going to take a shit. Nah, no. It was like, no, I'm pretty sure it was in the airport. I mean it's just been like fucking 11 slash 12 years. But yeah, it was, I think it was a, it wasn't uh, wasn't on the plane. It was like in the sort of thing and so, you know, I just, you know, and so I sorta sketchy started. Yeah, super sketchy. I don't even know if I use alcohol

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       and such a scumbag. So I uh, yeah. So I get to Vegas, I'm like feeling a little bit better. I'm just like, I'm such a sick. I'll want to go gamble. Right. Like I should've gone and checked into. Oh yeah, I did check into my room. I should've gone to sleep. No, I like go gamble, play poker all fucking night. I'm like gambling, you know, poker, stressful and this and that. My buddy comes to me, he's like, Hey, like, you know, we've got these strippers, like let's go to the Strip club or got ecstasy and all this drugs. And I was like, fuck, all right, fine. You know, I was like, winning the poker look fine. Sure. So we start getting fucked up, go to the Strip club and um, and I asked the, you know, and I asked the first check that like came over, like, oh, like you want them lap dances?

Speaker 6:          01:35:36       I'm like, no, like I haven't slept in like two days. Like I just want to get a dick sucked, give you $500 bucks, right. Segmenting. And she's like, no, like, you know, like I'll fuck you. And I was like, no, like, you know, I was like, I, you know, I don't really want to fuck you. I just want to get the blow job. And she slaps me like, because bc she's like offering to fuck me for free. And I said No. So she's like, oh, says you slapped me in the face, right? I go and I was like, Damn. And I was like, and then this and the next check comes up and I like offered to the same thing. I was like, hey look, I'll give you 500 bucks or something ridiculous. Like I don't really want any lap dances. She's like, well, you know, I'm down to hang out, you know, and uh, and, you know, I can get off.

Speaker 6:          01:36:17       And I'm like, fuck. I'm just like, wow, this sounds like she's going to want me to bang her. I'm like, I don't want to get slapped again. I was just so like, okay, like, you know, get your shit load. We go, let's get out of here, let's go out to party. So I talked to my buddy, I'm like, Hey, like I need it, I need a bag or some kind of Dick pill or something, you know, and I'd never taken Viagara. So I didn't really know the dosing or whatever. So he gives me the 100 milligram one, which is for fucking, if you don't know anything about Viagra for like geriatrics, right business thing. I take the whole thing. I don't know, like a minute goes by and I'm like, the fucking thing isn't working, you know, coked up. I think it seems like it's been at our right guys.

Speaker 6:          01:36:53       Like it hasn't been good enough to give me the fucking again another pill. And uh, so no. So he said, he's like, no, you can like give me the fucking thing. So it gives me another user only take half. He's like don't, you know, don't take this. And so anyways, so I'd take another half, wait like five minutes, do some more blow. And I'm like, oh my Dick's not hard. Like the girls aren't even around like I have no, like sexual esteem is no even reason for my Dick. The yard. Right. But it's like in my mind I'm like overthinking it, which makes it worse, right? So I'm like fuck it. So I take the other half. So now I'm like 200 milligrams into this fucking bag or which is like, you know, double the absolute Max from what, uh, you know, some guys have to get their Dick drained, right? Yeah, yeah. Well we'll get to that. So go back to my hotel and I'm like, fucking banging the shit out of this girl. Like, you know, I mean I got like veins coming out of my head. I'm sweating profusely and I'm like doing blue. I'd fucked her for like maybe like 45, 50 minutes. Like it wasn't not pleasurable at all if this was like work, right? I'm just like. And after like, fuck man, I think it was like 50 minutes. I just like, I just quit. Like I was just like, I just,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       you know, I just knew there was zero chance of me coming and I was like, punished this chick enough and I'm just like. And I like didn't like I was tired. I went in the bathroom, took a cold shower, my dick like wouldn't go down like I and I ordered some room service, end of like tucking it up into my waist. And um, because it's like there's just no going down for this bucket thing, right? It's ether room service I think. Oh yeah. Then I actually ended up taking a volume, went to sleep banger again, woke up, went and ate some Mexican food. I was like, betting on the sports game and I started getting like this pain in my shoulder and I didn't really like know what it was like. It kind of just felt like a, like an ache. So started doing pushups that didn't really make it feel any better.

Speaker 3:          01:38:41       And I was like stretching my arm and I was like trying to sleep, but I couldn't even lay on that side. I'm just like, what the fuck? Like heart attack never even entered into the realm of possibility of shit that could be wrong. Me, right. Like fucking 25, like I said, like shoulder pain, like wow, you know, I had no idea without having to do a hard time. So call my mom tardy at the family doctor on the phone. She calls this dude up and I'm like getting like kind of shorter breaths. So I'm like fuck. So I just hang up the phone and I find out the hospitals like 10 minutes away. So I'm like, fuck it. I'll just get a cap, be faster. I should've gotten an ambulance but I got a cab, you know, note to self, always get an ambulance if you've got any shit because I got the cab, I was in the waiting room for like 50 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:39:23       I pulled out like 10 grand out of my pocket. I told the Lady, I was like, I'll give you 10 grand. Let me talk to the fucking doctor. Like something's wrong here. I don't know what's wrong, but I know something's wrong. Anyway, she take the 10 grand, fuck no. Made me sit in the fucking waiting room and like 30, 40 minutes go by. Finally get seen by doctors like Holy Shit, like you're having a full blown heart attack. All that stuff and giving the Nitroglycerin and I call him my dad and my mom was like, you know, telling my mom like I'm thinking I'm fucking done. Right. And because this has been going on for awhile and I'm like having a hard time breathing. I'm like in pain and so they gave me the nitroglycerin right, and I, I start feeling better. They do an angiogram or whatever where they check out the heart that said there was no damage.

Speaker 3:          01:40:06       Parents come out the next day I have another one and I'm like, and I tell the doctor I'm going to say, and then my doctor was Conrad Murray too, by the way, which is Michael Jackson. Dr. Got it. Smoked him and the craziest. How's you're talking to. And the spookiest thing about the whole deal was my grandfather had the same doctor in the same motherfucking hospital exactly one year prior and died. So I'm just like, you know, this is not looking good for the home team. This was before it killed. Michael Jackson's asked to write sound like, you know, fuck, I'm just in the hospital. So I call my dad. I'm like, I'm having another heart attack. I tell the nurse and they're like, no, like your thing looks fine. I call my dad. I'm like, there's something wrong. My Dad like comes down to the hospital and sure enough like I'm having a second, like minor heart attack.

Speaker 3:          01:40:47       I'm like, what the fuck? So they do a bunch of tests to say my heart's fine and they asked you for like the list. So I got to like give him the list. And my ex girlfriends there, my mom's there, my dad's there and I'm just like, started off with like, oh well, you know, the smoking some pot. And he's like, well, you know, like, you better tell us like what you've been doing. It's important. We need to figure out what's going on with you. And I say ah, and you know, did you know I did some ecstasy cocaine and like, my dad like looks over at me like, what the fuck, you know, my dad is like Super Square and um, anyway, so then I was like, yeah. And I think it took some Viagra. My girlfriend's like fucking writing now and he's like, how much?

Speaker 3:          01:41:27       I'm like 200 milligrams. And he's like, why? I'm like, I don't fucking know. It was good seeing, you know, seem like this was tasing. That's like an insane amount, like anyway. So I, uh, I ended up staying in the hospital for like four days. I actually fucked my girlfriend in the hospital with all these cords and crazy. She'll, Jeez. Yeah. I smoked a joint in the hospital thing. I fucked her, like I had a buddy of my bringing like wine coolers and Chinese food, I think the worst patient of all time. Right. And somehow like, you know, so give me all these fucking pills. I got to take their telling me like I got to take these pills for the rest of my life for the rest of your life. So they said, and I was just like, after like three days, like they fucked my girlfriend eight, the Chinese food.

Speaker 3:          01:42:09       I was like, okay. I'm like back to being invincible again through all the shit. He's a heart attack. Exactly. I've heard that phrase, but what is the exact medical thing that's going on? You know, for guidance had to. I should know. I don't know. I think it's just like basically when your heart's not getting enough oxygen or something or um, I dunno. It's just not functioning properly. Yeah. Usually there's like a. yeah, there's like a blocked artery. There's like something and, and I think like coke is a, is a vasoconstrictor whatever, so maybe like constricted my veins. So there wasn't like an that isn't the way I grew up. Visal dilator. She shouldn't have balance it out I think, but I don't know, you know what I mean? I don't know. I don't really know the science behind it, but I know that like coke and wag or I don't think you're supposed to make some.

Speaker 3:          01:42:54       I Dunno. Wow. I mean, I know I did a lot of both. Should've canceled it out, but I guess it didn't. I guess my body was like so confused as going so directions. It's like fuck you to shut down. I don't know. Wow. But yeah. Wow. That's fucking terrifying. Twenty five years old and have a heart attack. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. Right. But your heart, your heart obviously works great now. I mean, you just, you did that vegas run crazy bike the book, which was a fucking hilarious cause you and I were talking about it and then Lance Armstrong gets hold of me. He says, hey man, I don't want to help them. I remember I got the text view and you're like, would you want lance to coach? I was like, Oh fuck yeah. So what did he do? Shit in the woods. So I mean he, it was funny because he came out and I was expecting, I was like, okay, like you know, what kind of drugs do I need to do? I'm like ready to get all doped up and he didn't really want to talk about it in the drug shit, which was kind of disappointing. He didn't want to talk about the drug shit. No, no.

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       I was like, I thought this guy would have like some like miracle formula. Right? I was like ready to get all hooked up, but I actually had like a super high humor credit count and he, he was actually the one that told me, he's like, I think sleep apnea makes it so that you have that you can have a really high red blood cell count. So I actually have like the equivalent of like the guys that are doing the EPO and doping, I guess

Speaker 4:          01:44:13       that helps in some sort of a way. Well, because you're, you're, you're basically at night you're gasping for air, gasping for air, and you're lacking oxygen. So it's Kinda like goes back to the whole like sleeping in an oxygen tent, right? So the reason you do that, it's because you don't have enough oxygen because you don't your body stimulate your red blood cell count and because red blood cells are what transports the oxygen. So the less auction you have, the more your body produces that. Well if it gets to a certain point, then your blood kind of turns into fucking syrup. Right? So this is amazing. Look at that. A surprising link between sleep apnea and red blood cell count according to Sleep Review magazine, elevated red blood cell count or a high hematic rate is an indicator of a lack of oxygen in the person's body. That's amazing. So sleep apnea can actually give you more endurance, sort of,

Speaker 6:          01:44:55       you know that the attire, the. Yeah, the problem is you don't really recover. So I actually got. I actually because of him actually ended up getting a mouth garbage I think helped.

Speaker 4:          01:45:03       Uh, I have a really good one and I know, I know a really good doctor. I don't know if yours is the same as what we'll talk about that letting the mom was like 50 bucks online. So it's probably not a guide. It's close to here. It's, it actually pushes down on your tongue because the issue is well with a lot of guys,

Speaker 6:          01:45:18       mine was they put my jaw, like it kind of moved my back jaw forward a little bit, Kinda like gives me an underbite. So I suppose

Speaker 4:          01:45:24       airway, but I don't know, that's not the best one. Yeah, there's a better one than that. For me it's, it's a life changer. It changed my fucking life. You know, guys will work out a lot in particular. You developed big neck muscles and that can constrict the air hole and your tongue can fall back on that. Especially if you lie on your back. Like if I align my back, dude, I, I sound, it sounds hard, but it sounds like choking and it's just terrific. Yeah, I'm in the same boat. Yeah. Um, so, so what did he have you do?

Speaker 6:          01:45:55       Lance or lance? Oh, so I mean I, I did it, you know, I did a good ride with him. We did like some vehicle drafting, which was actually surprisingly really fucking hard because you have to stay close enough to the vehicle to where you're like in that draft. But then if you get caught by a crosswind and plus if you're, if you're drafting a vehicle you can't see like what's in the road and if you hit any shit in the road, there's a, you know, because on my race I blew out a front tire doing like 30 something downhill and almost crashed. And I was like on the highway doing this too, so I like, you know, they have those things that wake you up when you're sleeping, you know, there's debate to try hitting that on a bicycle with little skinny tires you in like 30 miles an hour. Like that shit that gnarly. So it like sent me into the fucking highway and I'm getting passed. But like tractor trailers that like 70, 80, 90 miles an hour, which if you think about it, if you're in a car and it lays waste 5,000 pounds and it can pull a. imagine

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       what it does. Do a guy on a bike that weighs 200 pounds plus fucking 10 bikes. We didn't explain the bet what was the best. Oh, so it actually originally were in a poker game. And uh, Scott, Bill Perkins, he, um, he, you know, he just makes crazy best all the time because he's a real rich guy and he likes to just fucking make people do crazy shit. And it's Kinda like, you know, the poker world too. So the first bet was he bet my brother that he couldn't go three days without saying the word, the, I think it was like 100,000, something like that. And then the, I think he basically just wanted to shut my brother up to pay 100 because he was like, fuck you. So uh, well he ended up buying out because he realized that my brother was just like such a stubborn asshole that he wasn't going to talk for three days and he's like, married with kids.

Speaker 3:          01:47:39       He doesn't have to go out and get any pussy and like you could probably just sit home with this fucking miserable dogs and just like not talk for three days and just collect a hundred grand. So you ended up buying out of that. But that's on the honor system, right? I mean all of this honor system. I mean that's the thing about the poor communities, like you lie one fucking time or you don't pay a debt back and you're just done. Like nobody will fuck with you. So you, you know, your word has to be good, which is kind of like, you know, one of my things which, you know, irritates me, like when people say that I'm not authentic because I take great pride and like, you know, being fucking 100 percent honest about everything, you know. So, and that's been like drilled in through 13, 14 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:48:15       Gamble. That's a big one though if you're married because you to be like, listen, it's me with me. That doesn't count. Okay. You have to save the, you know, know that he. Yeah know he, my brother Woulda woulda told them. Um, and so, you know, we're just discussing crazy shit because in, in the poker world I've done crazy stuff like one guy, but another guy, 5,000 wouldn't jumping the shark tank. Atlanta's another guy bet that um, fuck, what was it? I mean I bet fuck, I bet $400,000 on a drag race and I hadn't even raced a car before. Um, and then there was, there was another, there's been so many crazy ones. I'm just trying to think of the highlight reel a boy. Um, there was one really good one, um, anyway, so he and abetting, um, I'll think of, I'll think of some other ones later, but he ended up betting.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       He ended up wanting to Bet Rick Solomon that he couldn't ride from La to Vegas or Vegas, la or whatever on a bicycle in 48 hours and rick called one of his buddies that has set some Guinness Book of World Records Things and asked him and the guy's like, look, like it's not going to fucking happen buddy, you can't do this. And so rick ended up turning down the bet and it was just really intriguing to me because I'm always up for physical tasks, you know, like during, during, you know, how you stay up for five and a half days with no sleep and you run 144 miles like boats and telephone poles and you get hypothermia and you're doing all this crazy shit. You don't sleep for five days and you're just

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       going the entire time. Right. So I've like put myself through some likes and I did two of those. Right? So I've put myself through some real serious, like physical tests and one of the things that you learned there is that your body's just capable of way more than what you think or anybody else thinks is capable of doing. But one other thing that you learn and gambling is that like there's certain things that sound like a good bet that just aren't just like drinking a gallon of milk in and hour like that sounds pretty fucking easy. Right? But like there's something with the lactose which like most people just physically can't do it without puking. Right. Because there's just some weird thing. But like, who would, uh, who would guess that are like saltine crackers? Like you can't, you know what I mean? Like there's like these weird little things that like sound super easy but you just can't do.

Speaker 6:          01:50:34       Yeah, I would think a gallon of milk would be totally doable. Yeah. Right. But it's like, it's a, it's like a thing. I mean, I remember I like better fraternity brother and he ended up puking like I, I bet him before his midterm and I remember in his midterm, you know, vomiting on a girl, kicked out of his, like projectile vomited, like a gallon of milk onto a girl in his midterm. I look pretty fucking brutal. A head. I was like, yeah, we had some funny midterms stories. I actually ended up taking my vitamins one morning with A. I had a thing of Ghb and it looks just like water, right? Oh No. So I ended up taking like a, like a full swallow because I had all these horse pills. I took like a full swig and I was like, holy fuck. I was like, I knew like as a guide, but 20, 30 minutes before I turned into a fucking wild animal.

Speaker 6:          01:51:19       Right. And so I just like got in my car and I drove right down and I called. My buddy was like, hey, I was like, I gotta take this final. I was like, I'm going to be fucking lights out in 30 minutes. You got to like, come pick me up. But I got to finish as much as I can. Right. So I go in there and I got like halfway through the test and I was just like, he ended up like carrying me out. Um, he was black out, right? Yeah. It was a state called the, it's a date rape drug. I think that's real hip. Normal. But he used me as well. They've used that on people too. Yeah, you. Well, you'd have to be a real fucking asshole to do that because if you mix it with alcohol you can kill somebody. So I know people have done it though. Yeah. You got to be pretty hard up for pussy to like risk killing the girl. The fucker. But I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       Have you ever seen. I'm speaking of the throwing up from drink a two milk. Too much milk. Did you ever see the opiod anthony sketch with the baby bird? Did you ever see baby bird know what that is? Maybe the most disgusting stuff that anyone's ever done on the radio. They had an eggnog drinking contest. And this dude, um, he drank 72 shots of eggnog. Is that what it was? Something like that, but then projectile vomited and then we were trying to figure out what to do here before he played this pauses for a second, because I'm explain it. He knew he was gonna throw up. So they had this intern named Pat Duffy, this intern's fucking crazy. And I'm dave from, from knocky. No, who's the other guy? Pat Pat from when knocky is the guy who throws up and, and uh, Pat Duffy

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       is the guy who is laying down there and he, we were trying to figure out what to do with the throw up, like you said, I'm going to throw up. And so this guy had done or like, what was it? No, no, no. He's an intern. He's, he's a fucking animal. It's. And one of them are trying to do anything. You will fucking do anything for us just for the store and just for the gag. So we say, okay, here's the idea, because you know, I was hosting fear factor at the time. I go, here's, here's the idea. You lean your head over the edge of the over the edge of this garbage pail and he throws up in your mouth and he's like, I'll do it. And we're like, no fucking way. And I think bill burroughs one who named it, he named it the baby bird.

Speaker 5:          01:53:25       And so just watch this because the sheer volume, you're not even going to believe that this is really all weekend long. I'm a caroline's all weekend long. Here's the plug. So pat had done this before. I mean he obviously, he's a giant dude and he was on like number, like 72 and this other kid, Pat Duffy sitting there with his head leaning. He's sitting in a chair leaning back with his head over this barrel and to this day, I mean they've got tarps all over the ground. Who else was there fear? Was there think red band was there to this day? Maybe one of the best moments of my life just because it was so completely fucking ridiculous. Yeah. So here it comes. He's like, here we go. He takes one last chuck and he's like, I'm going to throw up this.

Speaker 7:          01:54:14       Oh my God, you haven't seen nothing. You haven't seen nothing. He throws it his face. Now look at us now. It keeps going. This is nothing. When you think it's over, it keeps going. Now Watch. You think it's silver. You think it's over like there's no way he has more and now he's got way more inside. If I'm looking at, Oh my God, she's actually going to keep watching. Keep watching. He's done. He's not been done. How's it possible? Holy Shit. How is it possible? Oh my God. That was like the chicken. The midterm. Hang on, hang on more and this is not fake. I mean I was there and we were all there. We all saw this live

Speaker 5:          01:55:06       and I think he got his one more inside of him. Okay. He gets one more off now. He said that's it. He's done. Oh my God. Hold on. I got to have the greatest fucking brutal. Go ahead. One of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life. We're going to get back to this. A bike racing story. Ladies and gentlemen in a moment. Ridiculous. So it's remembering.

Speaker 8:          01:55:27       Yeah, I don't think it was on. It might've been on one of the jackass movies or the TV show. A bams uncle was crazy. Uncle drank like 70 shots of peach schnapps.

Speaker 5:          01:55:37       70 something. That's right. Shitload of Bam. Bam. Margherita. With Don Vito. The big guy. Yeah. Yeah. 70 seven projectile vomiting. All. I think it was said it was a lot. It was way more than 20. I don't know. You could die from that. There was a woman in San Jose or Sacramento, one of those places where she was doing a radio contest and it was like, how much water can you drink? And she died from drinking water. Like if you drink too much water, you could die the disk. I get sick from this vomit stuff at all to the kid. Pat. No kids. Bulletproof just doesn't get sick. That guy ate cat shit. He brushed his teeth with cat shit. He also ate fruit loops in the puke. Like he took a bowl of fruit loops and mixed it with the puke and ate the fruit loops. Yeah. Um, there's people out there that are different than you and I, Jamie is people that can do things that we can't do.

Speaker 5:          01:56:34       What's the why? Why it's just, I don't know, just for the story steps and now I don't know what we're talking about them though, you know what I'm saying? Like we're talking about, um, so it's, it's one of those things like that's why he did it. We're still talking about this isn't a world pre youtube really, right. I don't remember when it was. It says 2008, but I don't think that's correct. I feel like it was earlier than that. I feel like it was like 2003 or four or something like that. I think it was a long time ago is insane. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:57:03       So, uh, I think that was like the guy in college, so similar to that.

Speaker 5:          01:57:08       So back to the bed. So, um, so the bed is that you can't ride a bike from La to vegas, you have a starting point.

Speaker 6:          01:57:23       Um. Oh yeah. So basically it was two is gonna bet this guy. And he like, looked into it and he's like, Nah, that's not possible. And I was hanging out, I was just like, fuck, I was like doing some research on it and I like looked it up and I like googled, like, you know, how to prepare for 300 mile bike ride and a month. And like nothing came up. It came up like how to prefer prepare for 100 mile in like three months. Right. So I'm just like, that's not a good sign. But I just like, I don't know, someone, Bob and just thought it was possible. Um, so like talking to bill is like trying to get more time. And I talked to like some buddies that were cyclist, like look, they're like if you had time to train for this, like you could do it like, but there's fucking no way like just off the couch you could do it.

Speaker 6:          01:58:09       And I'm like, how long, you know, do I need. And they're like minimum three months. So I'm talking to bill and I kinda like want the bet. But I'm just like, I don't know how much money I really want to risk. And so he ended up sand that he would give me because it's because the initial bet was like, you just had to go do it tomorrow. Right. And I was like, there's no fucking way, like, you know, and then he's like, he goes, well I'll give you a month and I go give me. It was like until x date and it was like a little under six weeks. I was like, I'll do it. And he's like, how much do you want to bet? I was like, ah, it's like 600 grand because I wanted it bad enough to where like I would do it, but I didn't want to bet too much where it like, I'd not only like fucking break my ass but like, you know, just lose a shitload.

Speaker 6:          01:58:52       So I was like $600. Seemed like it was a good number. So we made the bat and I started doing some research. So I go down to the bike shop and I'm like, oh, like I need a bike. Like I'm doing a triple century ride and the guy's like, oh, like how, how much bike? And I was like, oh, like I haven't been on a bike, like ever really? I did some mountain biking like 19 years. The guy just like La. Yeah, that response you just like laughed at me. I'm like, no, like really? Like I got to do it. I got like five weeks and he's just like, he just like looked at me like I was a complete fucking retard and I'm like no, like I've got a bet, like I'm going to do it. And then the guy's like, okay, like what kind of bike do you.

Speaker 6:          01:59:30       I'm like, I don't know, like you're the bike shop looked like I didn't have no fucking idea. Right. So it gives me like this race bike, which is super fucking uncomfortable. So I go out and I ride this thing and I wrote it like, I don't know for like 45 minutes and my ass was just like fucking in so much pain. And I'm like, I am fucked. Like I think I made it like 11 miles and I was just like, this is going to be really brutal. And so I ended up finding like a bike where like you could sit down a little bit more with like a recumbent or whatever. It was literally a low rider bicycle. Right. Okay. So that'll kind of alleviate a little bit of like the ass issue. And it gave me like a slightly different, like pedaling position. So I got that and then I felt a little bit better about the bat and then I talked to like written a little bit but like nothing over like 20 or 30 miles and now it's like, you know, Kinda like going hard.

Speaker 6:          02:00:27       And then I talked to you and I talked to lance and lance like, Oh, if you use a fucking any other bike other than a road bike, like I'm not fucking, you know, I can't have any need to do this. And I'm like, why? I don't know. Because it's like a purist. Yes, he's a bike or out of the fucking no. So I'm just like, well listen buddy, I'm betting big money on this. I'm like, I'm going to do whatever the fuck I gotta do to fucking make it there on a bicycle. Right. And so anyways, then I Bet Rick Solomon, Rick, Rick thought I was going to die because like the route that I chose was like on the freeway and I didn't have a police escort at the time. So he's like, you know, this guy's gonna be driving on the freeway at night, like there's going to be trucks pass.

Speaker 6:          02:01:07       And I'm like he's, he's got a decent chance of dying. So. And he's like in the heart attack thing now actually went to the hospital because I was like having some shoulder pain again. And it felt very similar to the last things I was like fuck. So Rick is like, you know, he likes while you were training you were having shoulder pain? Yeah, like after I had done like a long ride. I'm one of the nights like I, like I actually went to the hospital, I was like kind of word. And so rick was like saying that and I was like, well honestly let's bet that I'll bet you I don't die. And I was like, I'll give you a because, because for me I'm like, well fuck, I can't take it with me if I do die, like fuck it, you know, like, and then it would light up the stakes for me without really like too much risk.

Speaker 6:          02:01:49       And so I was like, I'll, I like, I'll bet you whatever the fuck you want. You know what I mean? Like I'll bet you my plane. And uh, and I was like, I'll give you. I think it was like 10 to one or 21. I think it was like I gave him like, fuck, I think I initially offered them like 20 to one odds and then we settled it. Like, I dunno, it ended up being where he would, he would lose 250,000 and I would give him like my plane plus my pilots for he got my plane and then I'd pay the pilots for a year. We like at all you die, you had to die. But if I didn't, if I didn't complete the race then it was like a wash for me. I'm just like fuck. It was like Rick didn't think I could do it, period.

Speaker 6:          02:02:28       Right. So. So he didn't think there was a possibility that I could do it. And then he thought there was a decent chance that he could, that I could die. So for him he thought he was kind of free rolling. And for me I was free rolling because it's like if I die will okay, I don't need the fucking plane. Ain't going to take me to hell. Right. So like I'm good. So I made, I made the bet with him so. And then I bet a little bit on the side with somebody else. I basically had a million bucks on it when I finally ended up doing it and I. Yeah. And I cut a police escort like through vegas. So it's so funny because I had like 11 squad cars, like blocking off all the intersections and here comes this fucking Dildo on a bicycle. Like riding right through it.

Speaker 6:          02:03:04       I'm like, have all the, like, you know, you're expecting like a presidential motorcade to come or like, you know, somebody like every, like looking to see like what bucket 11 squad cars blocking off every intersection and here's this fucking asshole on a bicycle. A lot of people knew that you were going to do it. They didn't know when you were going to do it. He didn't announce when I didn't want to announce it because I didn't want people to fuck with me. You know what I mean? Like I didn't want fans to like come out and, you know, or people that hated me or anything, right? I just wanted this bad enough as it was, it'd be on the fucking highway. So, um, I ended up leaving from Vegas and uh, and I did it in about 32 hours was the whoa. And what was the bet?

Speaker 6:          02:03:48       Uh, it was, it was 48. Jesus Christ. Yeah. So I, I just remember it because there was like, because he was giving me some shit about cars I was allowed to draft, but he was saying that the van that I had had the doors open like, because you had to leave the doors open because I want to talk to my coach and they were like filming it and stuff. So we had the doors open. So he was like bitching, rick was bitching about that, which was kind of stupid rick to bitch about because that was like what made it the least safe of all was drafting off a car because you got to be like six inches from this car and you can't see like shit in the road. So if they have to slam on the brakes, you're fucking in the car, you're crashing. And we had times when, like there was a.

Speaker 6:          02:04:30       yeah, there was a time when we're on a fucking one lane road, right. And there was um, there was. So there's one lane and were in this lane and there's lane going this way and we had a car come to pass us as another car was coming. And Miss like our van by like inches and they were doing like 50, 60 miles an hour, like cross if they were to crash out of a dead for sure. Like it was fucking bad. And so like shit got pretty gnarly. Some of the spots I blew out a tire doing like 30 something miles an hour downhill. I mean it was like, who's, you rest it all while you're doing this? Yeah, I slept for like an hour or two, maybe an hour and a half. Um, and then I like stopped to eat but it was mostly just just truck the whole way through.

Speaker 6:          02:05:23       And so you stayed on this recumbent style bike the whole time? No, I did half of it on that and half on a road bike. Um, and then in the second half of it I didn't, I just, I did know drafting, I just did a road bike with no drafting, drafting. He was bitching about it and I just, I was just like, fuck it, I don't need it. Like it was bitching about, uh, while you were riding something like happens. Oh yeah, he was following me. So I'm having arguments with them and I was just like, it was helpful but it only helped on like flat, like it. So it doesn't help at all. I'm uphill, right. So no uphill. It helps. And on the downhill I didn't need it because you're going so fucking fast that like you don't really want to be going more than like 30, 40 miles an hour and down hills because like if you hit shit in the road, like you're and you crash, like you're fucked.

Speaker 6:          02:06:13       You know what I mean? Like if I crashed, like I couldn't finish the thing. So there's that and there's shit in the road. I mean I'm almost like the side of a highway, there's like tires and nails and you know what I mean, like, so you don't really want to be going like, and I couldn't go on the highway because I couldn't get the police escort for the actual highway. The CHP wouldn't do the highway portion of it. Um, so which, which suck is, that was like the most dangerous part. So I was in the breakdown lane instead of like actually being in one of the lanes, so there's just like, there's just shit and the breakdown lanes, you know, just like fucking nails and whatever. And you're doing it at night? Yeah, there was, it was like pitch black sometimes we had high winds.

Speaker 6:          02:06:51       I mean it was gnarly. It cut down to like 34 degrees at one point. Plus with the winds, I mean I had a ski jacket on. What you're thinking to yourself, what the fuck am I doing? A. Yeah, I mean I've had a lot of those moments in my life, but I was more like thinking like I just didn't know if I could do it. I just didn't know like physically because I had just never done any biking. I didn't know, but my legs were just going to like not be able to go anymore. I had no real experience in it so I didn't. That was my real concern was just like I knew mentally, like I was just never going to quit. I just didn't want to get injured or like just physically not be capable. That was like my two concerns. This is a video of you doing it this, watch this, look this, look at these two cars. They.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       That was. That was one fucking lane. They just passed each other. Yeah. That was very close.

Speaker 5:          02:07:45       Thirty eight hours? No, 30 to 32 hours. So 48 hours is the bet. And you did it in 32. How pissed was when you won? He actually treated it like a champ. He didn't really give a shit. It was pretty great. It got a lot of money. He's a baller. He is for sure. What does this. Is this your house or my house? Just went up on the bike for credit or are those the grinch? The next day I was like green. Fuck. You said the most one is 51 million. That was the most you've ever won before, but not in one sitting. That was over a course of eight, nine months. And that was just you going at it with this one dude and you guys playing one on one when you're doing shit like that. Oh my God. I remember there was one point where I was sitting there, that's a Granola Bar, ladies and gentlemen, you know, what the fuck is that sound? And I checked my watch in a while, so there was one point when at 18 million bucks in front of me and he had me covered. So if he said all I had to make a decision for 18 million bucks, oh my God, he's a billionaire. He didn't give a fuck. Eighteen dollars million on a hand in one hand up over. What's the most you've ever had. On one hand it was,

Speaker 5:          02:09:05       I think it was like

Speaker 9:          02:09:07       14,

Speaker 5:          02:09:08       10 million, 15 million bucks. Obviously you had a buildup to this. Like what? At any point in time while you're gambling these ridiculous sums of money. I mean this is not that long since you were broke. I mean this is like you going from college to you doing this, you know, we're only talking about a decade or so. Yeah. Um, that's fucking crazy. Well, there was periods of time when been over. I've played with like almost my entire net worth on the day. Will players do that kind of shit though?

Speaker 6:          02:09:39       Stressful. That's crazy. I've had my hair fall out before playing just because you're too freaking out. Shouldn't stress man, you know, like, I mean there's just so many things that go into it. Like you're, you're, you're not only thinking about like what that person has, but like what do they like? What did they think that you think that they have? Um, I mean the basic step is what do you think that they think that you have and then like the range of hands that they could have. Um, why, why, why would he be betting this? Why would he be calling here? What type of hands could he have? Like what are the probabilities that he's bluffing? Like what is his mental state? I mean like trying to pick up on telus. There's just so many things that go into it that you're, you're so focused and it's so much money and any little mistake that you make is going to cost you millions of dollars.

Speaker 6:          02:10:28       So it's like that. That is like a lot. And you're playing for sometimes 16, 17 hours. Like you're just like delirious. I remember one time while you're playing, do you take like provigil or add adderall or anything? I took adderall and it really fucked me up because I just like try to win every hand and it may be too aggressive and I just fucking plane crash into the mountain. It was terrible. So try that a couple times. No good. Um, try weed and it fucking was terrible every time I was bluffing a little paranoid so I, you know, know. And then sometimes I've taken like volume just so fucking relax, you know, because I'm just like strung out. But then that makes you kind of not give a fuck and so you do stupid shit. It's. Yeah, you just almost got to be sober. What about Beta blockers? Um, I never tried them.

Speaker 5:          02:11:15       I never tried to meet her, but I saw this thing on concert performers, like a penis or it was actually some people that playing in an orchestra. They were talking about, they took Beta blockers and it made a massive impact because they were super nervous about performing. And I always thought about it. I was like, man, that's a, I guess it just stops you from getting nervous. I would be really curious to see what that feels like.

Speaker 6:          02:11:37       Yeah. Yeah. No, that'd be interesting. I, uh, yeah, I've definitely heard of that. I think uh, I think it's a big thing for actors and stuff like that with stage fright or whatever. Sure. At just don't know how long it lasts because like I said, I mean these are, you know, you're talking about 18 hours sessions and it's just like. And also you don't want anything to fuck with your, like mental acuity. Yeah. Um, so

Speaker 5:          02:11:57       game. Do you lead your study strategy and read, read poker books? And

Speaker 6:          02:12:01       I did, I did, I did back in the day, but back in the day it wasn't quite as advanced. Now they have so much stuff online where you can basically watch these pros play. And I'll give you an example. Back when I was playing, um, I would play in college. I played 10 tables at a time. And you, yeah, and you would see about 100 hands an hour. Um, and let's say I just played for a 10 hour session. So you're playing 10 tables simultaneously. How do you do that? You have like 10 windows open up. Yeah. Wow. Yes. You're going click, click, click, click. All between all of them. Many of sometimes you have multiple monitors set up. Um, and so basically in that period, if you extrapolate that out, that's, you know, you're seeing 10,000 hands right in that 10 hours of sessions because 100 hands an hour per table times 10 times 10 times 100.

Speaker 6:          02:12:53       Um, so if you plan a casino, you're seeing about 20 hands an hour and you're obviously only playing one table. So that translates to 200 hands for that day. So have one one day playing online, I've seen 10,000 hands, one plant, one day playing live have seen 200. So you can imagine one day playing online, I've seen more hands than a guy that's played in a casino for his entire life. So just think about those numbers. And so the thing is like when you're playing in casino. Yeah, exactly. This picture, who's that dude? Lke, what's his name? Lke Elk. Why? That's his whole name. Was He like Oprah? I don't know. He's, I think he's a Swedish guy or something like that. And so he's just, he's got four giant monitors going on that like. I mean these guys are say more tables. That guy's got 12 on each side.

Speaker 6:          02:13:46       Yeah. Wow. So I mean this is what it's evolved to. You know, I was like one of the pioneers of this stuff because this guy got a fucking six monitors here. So when, when you, you can't do this in America anymore? Correct. Like it used to gamble online. It's stopped. I think a black pride or was in 2009. Was it? Fuck too. Why not? I mean, why not? Why can't my kids total bullshit? I mean it's a game of skill. Clearly. I mean they allow the fantasy because it's a game of skill. Um, and yeah, I just, I think it's nonsense. I don't really care because I wouldn't be playing online anymore because I can't compete with these kids. They've just put too much time in it. And the thing is now there's so much software that does so much for them. Like for instance, it'll tell you how many hands each person plays preflop, how many, what percentage of the time they bet the flop, what percentage of the time they bluffed, and they can just figure that out based on like how often they're going to have a hand in how often they bluff.

Speaker 6:          02:14:47       So to actually give you their bluff percentages on each street, on the flop, turn the river and it'll tell you like how, how many times they're just like calling bad. Like it'll just give you all these stats. So it's almost more turned into like a mathematical computer game. Whereas I liked the more pure form of just like I'm looking the guy in the fucking. I'm just trying to figure out what he's got. And you know, you're. And you're also playing the player. Like when you're playing live, like you know, for me, I can calculate how much money a guy has very fast. I can figure out like his comfort level with bluffing. I can figure out the type of guy he is. Whether or not he's aggressive, whether or not he's the type of guy that when he's winning, he's gonna want to lock it up or the type of guy that when he's winning, he's want to gamble more.

Speaker 6:          02:15:28       The type of guy that when he's losing is going to kind of play a lot more hands and try and get even, or the type of guy that going to just try and wait for a big hand. The type of guy that's going to be just calling his money, chasing, trying to get lucky. That kind of got, that's going to be pushing the action and betting a lot. Like there's just so many things that go into it that, you know, I like to just, you know, play live. And I like talk to people and I liked it. You know, have that human interaction. There's a lot of these guys that are really good behind a computer, but you put them in front of another guy. You can't look at man in the eye and just fucking blow up. You'd just like crumble, you know, so, so online.

Speaker 6:          02:16:00       They can click that button and say all in and do these crazy bluffs, but you know, they just physically can't push those chips in and keep a straight face on a table. So you know, there's something going on when you're, when you're looking at them, there's like, there's a certain amount of weeks. I, like I said, I've never played poker. So there, there is a certain amount of intuition and instinct. Yeah. Uh, it definitely is. It's not like in the movies where it's like, oh, like I picked up a tail on this guy and every time he bluffs he twitches or you know what I mean? Like, like that's a rare thing. It's more, it's more just like understanding the person. It's like you figure out what kind of job this guy does, like how much money he makes a year. Like how much this money means to them, how much he cares about the money, how much he wants to gamble, how much he's playing for fun, how much he wants to win. Some of these guys, they just, they actually want to lose their, just like self sabotagers, you know, they'll go in there and like some of them I'll see them and they'll want to lose because they'll want everybody at the table like them. And that's kind of like, you know, the path of least resistance.

Speaker 6:          02:17:00       How do you detect that? Like how do you detect that a guy wants to lose, he'll be, you know, he'll be just like wanting to be friends with everybody and he'll do shit to show off or to like, you know, make. Because I mean look at the end of the day, like people want people to play bad, right? Like you want a player to play like shit you want to play or to give his money away. You want to play or to, you know, uh, you know, do crazy stuff. So these guys will know. They'll put on a show for people that want to be the popular guy. Maybe they weren't cool in high school. Maybe they want people like them who knows what their reason is. Maybe they feel like they don't deserve the money. I'll play with a lot of guys that, you know, some of them ended up in jail, some of them are fraud somewhere cheat.

Speaker 6:          02:17:31       Some of these guys, you know, they have a bunch of money and they feel like they don't deserve it subconsciously, so they'll just want to give it away. It's just the thing that's interesting. And do you see a lot of guys who just lose everything? I've seen it before. Yeah. I've seen guys go completely broke. It's tough because in gambling you can just keep going up but you can't really go down. It's like for instance, if you go and you play blackjack and you bet whatever arbitrary number of $500 a hand. Right? And you were playing 500 bucks at hand and you know, your level of excitement when you win is at a seven and you keep playing and whatever and then now you go and play a thousand bucks a hand and even winning a little bit or you've been losing or whatever. And now if you try and go back to $500 to 50, it's just like, you know, if you're losing, it's just like it's, it's a mental fuck because it's really hard to get even betting smaller and if you've been winning you don't really care about the small money.

Speaker 6:          02:18:27       Right. Like you want to, you know what I'm saying? It's like one of those things where like once you go up it's really hard to go the other direction. So a lot of, a lot of the problems that professional poker players have, it's called bankroll management, where they keep going up and up and up. And then when they start losing they, they are completely unable to drop down and steaks and then play good. You know, like if they lost let's say $100,000 just to use round numbers at, you know, this game. Then for them to go to play a game that's half that size and try and win that hundred $100,000 back, it's going to take them twice as much time. You know what I mean? So it's kind of like one of those things where, you know, in the games have gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, so somebody goes on a bad run, like, and poker is their profession.

Speaker 6:          02:19:12       It's not like, you know, that's, that's another thing that people don't understand. It's like, you know, people, people are like, oh, you're winning. Like you should, you should take the money and run. It's like, no, like when you play poker for a living, like it never ends. Like there it's like yeah, there may be session to session but like you're always going to be playing poker. So it's like if that's a good spot you should just play until the game's over. Like even if you want, it's not like blackjack where you should just lock up a when like in poker you just stay there and in fact the more you're winning, the more other people are losing and the more other people are losing the worst they're going to play. So it's Kinda like one of those things where you just, you know, it's just one long session. It never ends. You know

Speaker 4:          02:19:49       how pissed too people get when they lose fuck tons of money. If you ever had issues with that where people get violent or people were angry.

Speaker 6:          02:19:57       Definitely angry. And it's funny because, and I, and I'm a victim of this too, like I've found sometimes I've gotten far more angry at losing $20,000. Then I have at losing $500,000. A strange as that may sound. I'm just because

Speaker 4:          02:20:14       you know, of the way I lost it or if I played shitty or if I lost it to a guide in like, or it was just like I lost, lost, lost, lost, and just like a steady progression of losses. Or if I was up a ton of money and then like let's say I was up a million dollars and ended up losing $20,000. Like I'd be fucking miserable even though I only lost 20 grand. But let's say I was down a million dollars and I ended up losing $20,000. I'd be ecstatic. Now look at the end result was one night I, I

Speaker 6:          02:20:44       one slash 20 grand and I was miserable and the other night I lost 20 grand and I was happy, right? Because I started off up a million and then last ended up being a $20,000 winner. Like that seems like a million dollar loss to me because at one point in that game I was up a million bucks, right? So mentally, you know, I kinda like in my mind I've lost a million dollars. And then in the other game I was down a million and then ended up only losing $20,000, so almost broke even. So I'm like ecstatic, you know what I'm saying? So there's

Speaker 4:          02:21:13       also something that you were just talking about that I think is really interesting because it kind of parallels a martial arts and fighting and a lot of ways is that you don't want to lose someone that you hate. Yup. Yeah. And that's a big factor. And fighting. That's why conor mcgregor does so well is that he fucks with your head so bad that the amount of pressure that's on you is so exacerbated when you actually get into the cage with them. Like even guys like Josie, although who's this seasoned world champion who never lost in the UFC, hey connor just mind fucked him and he can punch. I mean it's, it's both things. He's got skill and he's really good at handling pressure and he's the mindfuck master, but you see it with guys when guys get in these emotional situations with fighters and then you see when they fight with someone who respects them and shake hands the weigh ins and they could fight up to their full potential. I that that is a big factor I guess in poker as well. Yeah, definitely. I mean there's, I've seen tons of times when somebody really hates another player and in fact like has just played far worse against that guy and given that guy so much money because they, they, they kept going after him. You know, like they really wanted bluff them.

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       They're like, fuck this motherfucker. I'm not going to let this guy blocked me and then they ended up just paying them off and paying them off and paying them off. I actually found that in poker because there was times when I'd be friend, really bad players and then that player would not play hard against me, you know, because of that. And it actually ended up costing me a bunch of money and then there's other times when I would just like talk shit to a bad player and they would really come after me and then I'm just smoking them, you know? So it's Kinda like, it's tough because usually the bad players were the coolest guys because they're just like the rich guys that are having fun and they got a good attitude and this and that. But sometimes you know, like you gotta fuck with them a little bit, you know, cause otherwise you're not going to be able to gamble with them really.

Speaker 6:          02:23:07       You know. So you want that. Like you want that kind of like, optimally you want that competitive but semi friendly relationship because you don't want them to just totally hate you because then you'd be like, fuck this motherfucker, I'm not playing if he's there and then you're kinda like out of the game because he's the big sucker and he can call the shots, which just seems like such a psychological management thing with, with poker players. There's a lot, man. It's a real, it seems on the surface like an easy thing to do. No it doesn't. But I feel like for a lot of people they look at it and they're just like, oh, he gambles for a living. Like he got lucky or he's just like good with numbers. You know? They've break it down so simplistically that they don't realize like how difficult it is.

Speaker 6:          02:23:47       But isn't that the case with everything? I mean I've heard people say that about Nascar, like Oh, they'll just turn left. Like No. Well Nascar's, I would, I would come. I think that the closest comparison is with the stock bark, like stockbrokers, stock market stuff, you know, because they're really gambling. I mean at the end of the day that that is kind of gambling and you know, and they're going to have losses. The, the, the parallel there is that you can go into work, you can fucking do a good job, bust your ass to everything, right, and then just get fucked because of bad luck. That can happen to a doctor. Really. You know what I'm saying? Like that can't happen with most professions. Like even in fighting, like even the loser gets paid, right? You don't go into a fight and lose money if you lose, right?

Speaker 6:          02:24:27       Like poker and the stock market or some of the few things that like, it's kind of hard to really have that good bankroll management because you can go into everything, right? Bust your ass and work for an entire month and lose money. But that is where the thrill lies to the common man, the, the, the average person that plays it safe and takes it easy and gets his 401k and doesn't, doesn't do anything risky. That's where the thrill lies and that lifestyle, like talking to you and hearing you talk about this shit, that's where people that are getting their palms are sweaty right now when they're driving to work and they listen to this and thinking, could I do that? Could I do that? Could I do that? Most people can't. Most people cannot. It's, I mean it's, it's, it's one of the hardest things I've done and I've done a lot of hard things just because for me doing, doing physically hard things actually isn't like as challenging as mentally tough things.

Speaker 6:          02:25:20       Um, if that makes any sense because the physical stuff fit the physically tough stuff. You just kind of like sparking bite your tongue and grit and fucking take the pain and just power through like, well that's got to be one of the benefits of going through buds twice. Yeah, I mean it puts it in perspective. Yeah. I mean just, you know, you've been through way more of a hellacious physical test than most people could ever endure. Yeah. I mean, I think a lot of it comes down to, you know, a lot of people are like, oh, like, you know, you must be a super tough motherfucker and all this other shit. And I think it comes down more to just like how bad you want it. Like in life, like if you just want something so fucking bad. Like I just remembered like when I was doing the 50 meter underwater swim is really hard for me.

Speaker 6:          02:26:04       I'd never been able to do it. Um, outside of, you know, seal training and the only two times I did it was when I had to do it and I just remembered, I was just like, well I'm just going to swim until I fucking reached the wall or blackout. Like there just wasn't another option. Like I was just like, I just wasn't going to quit just because I wanted it so bad. So that actually helps you. I remember there's one guy that that went into buds and he was um, he had like a million dollar business. I think it was, I think it was the guy that owned van Dutch or something maybe, or had some affiliation with that and I just remember he went into buds after that. I just remember he showed up and he had like a hot chick or two hot chicks and it, a sports car and everybody's like, fuck, he's a stud.

Speaker 6:          02:26:44       You know what I mean? Like it was like, and then he like showed up a buds and ended up quitting like straight away. And I was just like, but it didn't surprise me because I'm like thinking, you know, if, if, you know, if I don't make it I'm going to ship and I'm going to be fucking miserable. Like I don't want that. Like this guy's thinking like if I quit I can go like fuck a bunch of girls and like drive nice cars. And I got money. Like, you know what I'm saying? So like for him it was like, I actually think it's harder, you know, like, because you look at like, you know what your alternatives are, you know, like, like, you know, if you, if you put a fucking guy up against the wall and he's got no choice, then he's just going to like do what he's gotta do.

Speaker 6:          02:27:22       Like for instance if I told you you had to go crawl, you know, 50 miles or I'm going to fucking put a bullet in your head, like you're probably going to go crawl that 50 miles. But, but I told you, hey, like I'm going to give you $500,000, you know, if you can go crawl these 50 miles, but you know, you got money and you don't really need it, you're probably not going to crawl 50 miles. You know what I'm saying? Like it's Kinda like one of those things. It's just like the alternative is what determines the difficulty. It was a great scene and officer and a gentleman remember what your gear. I don't know. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I do remember that. And that's exactly it. I got nowhere else to go. That's one thing I tell people when they're thinking about fighting, I say, is it all you want to do? Is it. Is it your whole life? Does it absorb you? Does it do? Do you want that more than anything that you can imagine? It's not like, well, fighting doesn't work out. I'm going to be an author it because if that's the case and you want to do it for the experience, that's cool, but if you actually think you're going to be a champion, if you have all these other escape routes and it's

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       not going to happen. That's why I actually think it's harder for guys like conor mcgregor or guys like mayweather because now they have money and they have that lifestyle and it's like that. I actually thought Rhonda was going to get fucked up just because she likes she, you know, she was going to Hollywood. I mean, don't get me wrong, she's tough, she's fucking great, whatever, but you know, she was like doing the movies and she's doing this and it's like I just, I know that lifestyle and I know the addictiveness of the money and the fame and all that other stuff and now it's like these people that have been fucking, you know, living in a one bedroom apartment are now introduced to all this money and all this fame and people and it's just, it's so distracting as opposed to the guy that's like, you know, fucking waking up everyday and going to the gym and fucking busting his ass and just trying to make ends meet and that's all he's got and he's got no fucking nowhere else to go.

Speaker 4:          02:29:06       Like you said, you know. And, and for that guy, I feel like it's far easier to stay the course for garlic, conor mcgregor. Now he's got all this money and this and that, you know, he's, you know, he doesn't have to fight anymore. Like like I mean, yeah, he like if he wants to continue his lifestyle, he does right now he's like up as expenses in his image and all this stuff and he's used to all this stuff and now he has to make x to maintain his current situation. So he's got a little bit of pressure on them in that sense, but he's not, he's not struggling. He's not hungry anymore. You know what I mean? He's got the pencil on who you are though. I mean everybody has a different motivation. Some people, it's not even like they changed the goalposts instead of becoming rich.

Speaker 4:          02:29:46       It's become the greatest of all time. It's like you look at all these other guys that are nipping at your heels and you decide, no motherfuckers, I am the man at the top of the mountain and I'm going to stay at the top of the mountain as long as my body hangs in there. But again, it's like that has to be something that you want to do and you could see the shift. I see the shift in guys were, they all of a sudden they do it for money and they started doing it for a living. You see that shift and it's an ugly shift because they just don't have the same tenacity is like I see a lot and like nfl and stuff like that, I'm sure we get tired of getting your fucking bell rang to men know he get tired of Bang Bang clashing heads with people and running into each other.

Speaker 4:          02:30:24       After a while that shit gets tired. I remember there was a big basketball player, um, and he would play poker and it was funny because he would go on these vendors and he would play for like 24 hours straight or something. I just remember we just always bet against him and he was like a big, big basketball player. Like he was like the star on the team or whatever. And so we were just like, always bet against like whatever team he was playing, if he had been playing poker for 24, 48 hours, which is bet against the other team were right, like almost every time. Like he just like always played like shit. Yeah, fuck yeah. It's like mentally exhausting. He's not sleeping, you don't eat. It's just like it's just hard on your body or you, you're screwed. The cortisone or whatever cortisol levels go up.

Speaker 4:          02:31:03       I mean it's just like, yeah, it's, it's tough. I mean it's a balancing act I think in anything in life, but especially in risky things, whether it's playing poker or fighting or anything along those lines. Something that's really difficult to do. There's this weird balancing act and you have to this this perfect balance of motivation, reward, intensity, focused, disciplined, but still pleasure. You can't be miserable forever. Like there's to be a time where you have fun too. It's hard. I mean, like I said, I think it just comes down to like, you just gotTa want it, you know, you just got to fucking just want it really bad. But there was some study recently that I was reading about whether they were talking about how you can't be happy all the time and you don't want to be happy all the time. Like literally, you won't achieve the same levels of happiness all the time if you're not miserable like you, you don't ever hit those highs unless you hit those lows like you ever been around someone who's manic ever day to check his manic. I know where you're talking about the suite is a sweet, the

Speaker 3:          02:32:05       bitter end. And I've found that I'm actually have an interesting outlook on that because I have bought pleasure for so long, I can't buy happiness. You can buy a pleasure though. And a lot of people say, oh, money isn't happiness, money can buy a boat and the boat will make me fucking happy. That kind of thing. Right? So I'm an example I like to give is, you know, when I was 16, like my dream car was a, um, a Mustang Cobra, right? So if I got a Mustang Cobra, I would have been a 10, right? Um, but, you know, a Ferrari would also bring me to a 10. I mean, he, but you can't go higher than a 10, right? So let's just say that I got, um, you know, uh, you know, the, when I was 16 and now we flash forward, I graduated college and my dad gives me a, let's say he gives me a BMW m five, if I had the Ferrari, now I'm going to be kind of like probably at a seven, right?

Speaker 3:          02:32:56       Because I'm stepping down on a car. But if I had the Mustang Cobra and now I'm going to an m five, I'm going to be back at a 10. Well it's the same car. You're the same person. You're at the same spot in life. The only difference is your perspective because your previous experience, you know, so it's Kinda like when people ask like why rich people aren't as happy and I just think it's because they've upped the bar so far that only the best things satisfy them. Like a guy off the street. If I took like when I was going to the bootcamp, I'll use that as an example. I go to outback steakhouse, I'm going to 10 right now. If I go to the best restaurant in the fucking world. I mean, I'm like maybe like a six or a seven. I'm just like, satisfied. I got three chefs, like I eat the best food all the time, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          02:33:41       So like that doesn't make me happy anymore. Like if, if somebody bought me a Lamborghini, I'd be like whatever, like I've had them, I don't care like it. But if you're gay, you know, give it a guy off the street, he'd be at a 10 so I can't buy happiness anymore. You know what I mean? I bought every fucking thing that I ever wanted, right. There's not really anything that I want so I can't buy any like, pleasure. Um, and also if you gave me like a regular car or put me in a regular hotel, I would actually be it like below the normal level. Whereas a normal person would be like happy to be on a vacation, you know what I'm saying? So like I think that has like some correlation. It's Kinda

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       like a guy that wins the lotto like a year later. He is like statistically less happy than a guy that got his leg amputated a year prior, you know? Yes. That's, that's interesting. It's also, I think, what are you trying to do? Like do a lot of people that are trying to get rich because they think that once they get rich there'll be happy. They think that that's going to give them this thing that they've always been missing. And so they've been working hard, busting their ass and they look at all these other people like we're talking about, you know, you uh, you land your private jet, you drive your, your Bentley to the club. And everybody's like, oh, samples, you want to be that guy. Right? But once you're that guy, it's like, that doesn't mean anything anymore. And then for a lot of people there's this emptiness, there's nothing left to chase, there's nothing else to do.

Speaker 4:          02:35:00       And your life is just about possessions and upping the ante. And now I got to get a yacht and now I have to get the biggest yacht. Now I've got to buy an island, you know, and trying to find something to fill that void. Because you've sort of set your life up to chase these material goals instead of to try to find out what actually does make you happy. You have to have goals and you have to have stuff that like, you know, you got to be climbing the mountain because at the end of the day like climbing the mountain is far more satisfying than being at the top of the mountain. You know? Isn't that weird though? That's not what we've ever been taught. Well, it's counterintuitive because most people don't like get the, they just know that like, okay, like, you know, my dad told me like it's better to give than receive.

Speaker 4:          02:35:40       And I was like okay, that's perfect by the burglary unit, just give me shit and I'll receive it and I'll be happy. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, but you don't have it. If you don't have it then that makes sense. Yeah, exactly. And like, you know, just people. I mean it's just experience like, I mean like from the time you're a little kid, you get something, you're happy. Like you know, you get a boat, you're happy. Like if I have this bike, I'm be happy and, and it's true and it works, you know what I mean? But there's a point you almost have to like get really rich to understand that you really have to just buy all that shit. It was okay. Like I got it all, it's cool. That made me happy, but it's temporary, you know? That's, that's I, that's kind of where I differentiate the happiness and the pleasure, you know, you can buy the pleasure for the pleasure is somewhat short lived, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:36:21       Yeah. I had a conversation with someone about this recently where I was saying that material possessions, once you have enough money to acquire basically everything you want, they don't mean anything anymore. So they don't mean anything. You can enjoy them when you have them. What if you lose them? It's really not that big a deal. You know, if like if you get an escalate and fucking meteor hits, you're escalating and go out there. Homes get another escalate, there's bunch of them. It's no big deal. But if that was all you had and you had a save and scrape up your money to get that escalate and he kept it clean, then it got hit by a meteor. You'd be devastated. Yeah. Once you have achieved this level of success where material possessions don't mean anything anymore, then you can kind of like, okay, well what do I enjoy? Camaraderie, friendship, creativity. Like what is it that I'm actually chasing? Because I remember talking to this Buddhist monk, I had to do this thing once where I went to all these different religions. It was for this TV show and I interviewed all these different people and ask them like, what? You know,

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       what is it about your religion that's the best. Like say if I was going to join your religion, you try to sell me your salad, and the Buddhist guy was saying that sex and all these material possessions, they, they possess you and that to be completely free, you have to be abstinent and you have to be free of material possessions. I said, well, why? I go, what if you achieve a level of success where you don't worry about those things anymore and they don't, they don't, they don't contain you, they don't hold you there, you're not a prisoner of them because you're really not worried about them. Like if all you had was this one thing and that one thing was taken from you, that would be devastating and that's what this is based on. But what if you had unlimited resources? If you were, if you were Richard Branson or someone like you or whatever, when you're, it's not an issue then then those material possessions no longer possess you, but this guy didn't want to look at it that way. Like he didn't want to think that that was ever a possibly an option. I'm like, well, it's not an option because you don't think it's possible to achieve that level of material possession of that material success.

Speaker 6:          02:38:16       Yeah. And that's Kinda the thing I feel like you have to, you have to get to that place to understand it. You know, it's Kinda like tell him that

Speaker 1:          02:38:23       to anybody who's listening to this like 99 point nine percent of people listening to this are never going to make a fraction of the amount of money that you've earned.

Speaker 6:          02:38:31       Yeah. But you know, in some ways that is a blessing because they're going to have a lifetime of being able to buy that pleasure to because of that. You know, because if you start here on this lower rung than all those little purchases and stuff like that, you're still like, you're enjoying the shit out there. Their baseline is just lower, right? They get a new fishing rod, they're fucking pumped. Exactly. You know, and when that wears off, then they're gonna get a new reel and you know, when that wears off, they're gonna buy a new depth finder. What, you know what I'm saying? It's like it's the little ship, that little shit. If it makes them happy, then that's, then that's okay. But,

Speaker 1:          02:39:07       but to the people listening to this right now, they're thinking, okay, well you're equating material possessions in the acquisition of these material possessions as being the thing that makes people happy. Now is this because you've got 15 bitches and you're flying around on private jets and yachts and you're, you're lacking like real depth to you. You're a smart guy. You're not a dumb guy. So I don't, I don't think that that's the case. I think you're having a lot of fun and you're, you know, you're doing a lot of wild, crazy shit. But I don't think you're lacking in depth.

Speaker 6:          02:39:35       Yeah, no I am just trying to fully experience everything that I wanted to experience. And there also a part of me that's, you know, Kinda doing some wish fulfillment, some part of me that's overcompensating for lack of things, you know, that I had childhood was or when I was growing up or that I wanted or whatever it was basically just kinda like whatever I wanted when I was younger or whatever I place emphasis on, I kinda like just overexaggerated and beat it into the fucking dirt. So then now I can move on and do something else like my life, you know, I have, I have add, so for, it's like hypersensitive or real. I think it is and I think I think a lot of successful people have it and I think what it allows you to do is when you are focused on something and when you have that like pinpoint focus, you can be extremely successful but when you don't, you're just scattered all over the fucking map and you can't accomplish anything.

Speaker 6:          02:40:31       I mean you're just like. And I think a lot of kids have nowadays because of the stimulus, I think. I think you have so much stimulus at your fingertips nowadays that these kids, if they're not, I guess I guess what I'm trying to say is that people just overstimulated in and because they have it at their fingertips all the time. Like when I was a kid, like we used to have to entertain ourselves. You said it was just like go out and play, you know, and just like figure out shit to do. And so we didn't need massive amounts of stimulus nowadays. If kids don't have a fucking video game and a movie playing at the same time, they're bored and three other friends to talk to, you know, so it's when they're hanging out and they're constantly checking their phone, they're not even looking at each other.

Speaker 6:          02:41:09       They know. Yeah. And I'm victim of it too, you know, it's like, it's like, it's crazy you'll, you'll be, you'll be in a social setting and there'll be five, six people at a table and they'll all be on their phones and it's just like, it's Kinda sad that, that we've been reduced to that level of interaction where it's just like electronic, like this just all electronic and people, you know, like I mean when people call people nowadays, this is like, wait, what the fuck? Like why are you calling me back when we were kids, like there wasn't even texting, you know, it was like flip phones. Like now it's like if somebody calls you, it's like, wait, what the fuck? I go, I have one friend, Joey Diaz. We never text each other ever. He might've texted me once, I was like, what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 6:          02:41:47       All we do is call. He goes, I don't like to text. He goes, I like the car, I want to hear your voice. I'm insecure. I want to know you love me. Like you. He wants to talk to you on the phone. I think that's, yeah, we're, we're definitely missing something. We definitely missing something by all this electronic shit, but it's, it's also like a new style of living and I'm sure humans will adjust eventually. We'll figure it out how to manage it or, or change accordingly. The one positive thing I think is just that you,

Speaker 3:          02:42:15       you're so connected, you know, everybody. I feel like everybody's more connected now. Like back when we were kids, like you know, a guy in Idaho is never going to fucking feel any connection whatsoever with somebody that's in California, but now like that guy can upload a youtube video and everybody around the world can see it and people are just, you know, dating wise, social media wise, like whatever. They're just, there is more connection. I mean I feel like it's, it's not quite as real and it's not as tangible but. And people I think are also losing, I'm losing the ability to kind of like interact like I like my older friends, like we'll sit around, we'll tell stories and it's like we'll have fun. And it's like the younger generation when you watch them interact, it's almost comical. It's like these people like socially awkward, like they don't like people don't know how to like approach girls anymore. It's just like in the whole thing has been reduced to like online dating,

Speaker 6:          02:43:10       you know, it's, it's a, it's a new world

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       for sure. I mean, I don't know there's a new world, but what I found really fascinating is that because I travel a lot doing stand up is that there's no dumb places anymore. Like you can go to, you know, fill in the blank some place in the middle of the Midwest, Boise, Idaho or whatever. And you'll do a show there and the fucking people are on the ball. They know what the fuck's going on there. There's so much more informed. When I used to travel on the road in the nineties when I used to do stand up in the nineties and you know, fly into Ohio or sorry Jamie, fly into someplace in the middle of the country is fucking people were apes. I mean they didn't know anything. They were like, what's it like to be on an airplane? Mean fucking didn't know anything. No one.

Speaker 4:          02:43:51       But now it's like you run into the same kind of people in la that you can run into in fill in the blank, you know, Phoenix or whatever, wherever the fuck it is. There's no dumb cities anymore because you're still gonna. Find some dumb people. But I think overall the awareness level of people has changed and I think that's a lot due to the internet, you know, honest that accident. I mean, when I was a kid, if I wanted to know something, her mom's like, okay, look it up and the encyclopedia Britannica. And I'm like fuck that. I'm not going to do that. And we literally would have like hundreds of encyclopedias around the thing and like, you know, we thought that was great, but now it's like you want to know something, you google it and you just instantly know it. Like you don't even have to press it, you just talk into your phone.

Speaker 4:          02:44:35       You don't have to type, you know? Yeah. You just ask Siri. It's like google cold fusion shows you instantaneously. I mean, it's so freaky that they didn't even think about it in star trek or star wars. None of those places had the internet. None of those visions of science fiction in the future had the internet. It's, it's, it's. I think it's going to be when, when history is all said and done, when people look back on this era as it's going to be one of the biggest changes in the human race ever. And we're in the middle of it. It's a storm and we're just caught up in it. And like you were talking about when you were saying how you're so wealthy and it's just normal, it just becomes normal to you to have all this money and someone gives you a Lamborghini. It's normal. Well, this wealth of information is normal to us.

Speaker 4:          02:45:15       It just seems normal, you know, and you know, my kids are young, they're grown up with the internet their whole life. They've never experienced anything but the internet. So it's to them they're not gonna know how weird it was to run into bullshit artists now. People just lied about stuff. Like you couldn't google them, you know, now you can just like, if you want to know about somebody fucking google them and it's like, okay, this guy's a scam artist. This chick's a hooker. You just got their life story. It's like Bam, like wikipedia or else. Yeah, it's Kinda crazy. Before we did the podcast, we started talking about psychedelics and you started talking about some psychedelic experiences that you had. And I still like save it, save it, because I wanted to talk to you about it on the air. So tell me, tell me what, what has happened? I mean, you actually, the one that turned me onto it, the DMT. Um, I was, the first time I tried, I was at burning man and I smoked a small amount of it. Um, and it was interesting. I was, I mean, it was,

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       I felt like it was a pretty enlightening experience. Um, I tried it a second time. We had this small Malik, how many hits? Just one, just one. So I was uh, you know, it wasn't like deep in it or anything. It's got to the doorway. Took a look inside. Yeah. And I just, I don't know, it felt like a little bit of sense of peace and clarity, you know, but that was all I really got from it. The second time I did not have a good experience. I had this, a Shaolin monk come over and he a priest or whatever you call them and um, I don't know if we did too much, but I just didn't really get too much. I actually got more out of it after, um, but during the experience it was like, it was just too much. I didn't really get anything.

Speaker 3:          02:46:53       It was just almost like overwhelming. Yeah. Yeah. It was just overwhelming where like, yeah, it was almost like a, almost like a video game, kind of the best way to describe it where I just like kinda almost seemed like everything was kind of like separating apart, um, but didn't really get too much. Um, and then the third time I had a similar experience. Um, but that was, that was just a smoking. I haven't done Iowasca or anything like that. I did mushrooms three times. Um, it was funny. I, I had a couple, so the first time I did mushrooms I think goes was in high school and I just never forget because it was like 1:30 in the morning or whatever. And I just wanted to call all my friends and tell them how great it was and have conversation. I remember them picking up the phone, like Cheetahs 30 fuck off, but I was just like, I want to talk to everybody.

Speaker 3:          02:47:44       I was like, I was having a good time and then I did an Amsterdam, got sick and it was funny because I actually did it four times. The third time I did it, we were in Amsterdam and we were walking down this long alleyway and we were probably about 75 yards down the alleyway and a buddy of mine, it was like, oh, give me a second, and we kept walking and we turn around about five seconds later, 10 seconds later, and he was gone and it was probably like a 200 yard. Allie, where's, I mean this guy was fucking Ben Johnson. He couldn't have made. It was like a long, long alleyway there. If he was in a dead sprint is a fast guy in the world. He couldn't have made it the end and there was no like no ladders, no nothing. We're just like, what the fuck happened and this dude, we're just like, and nobody can and we haven't even really started tripping, but we're like, we thought this do got abducted by aliens.

Speaker 3:          02:48:41       There was like no explanation, right? With like turnaround and we're just like, we all looked at each other like, what the fuck happened? And we knew these mushrooms are gonna hit soon. So we're just like, but we didn't feel it. We're like, the mushrooms ain't hit. We just ate it like, you know, five, 10, whatever, you know. And it hadn't hit, walked around the corner and there was a police station were like, Oh shit, like I guess we should ask them. And we went in there and we're like, we don't know what happened or a friendly, we don't know if he got or whatever. And we're like, he looks like this. And so there's this long alleyway, right? And this motherfucker chose the one spot to piss where apparently there was like a secret door that opened inward into the police station and there was a camera facing down and he was pissing on the door.

Speaker 3:          02:49:25       The police station, they grabbed a mid pissed stick still out in the fucking police station and throw them in jail. And it's. So we get this information, we're like, oh fuck, like what do we gotta do? Like we got to pay this guy, like we're like, this dude never done mushrooms before. His first experience, he's going to be in a jail in Amsterdam. This guy's my gonna fucking lose his mind. Like we gotta get them out. So we ended up paying these people and then like, I forget, we've got to pay them a lot because I was in college. I remember it was like a significant amount of money for us, but we bailed them out. And then I ended up. I remember I offered like the chicken, the counter. I was like, I'll give you 100 bucks if you'll mail this to his parents or the video of pissing and getting arrested if you met his parents, get the fuck out.

Speaker 3:          02:50:10       So that was number three. And then the fourth time I did it, I was in, um, it was that trip that I took to Puerto Vallarta. And uh, when I took my buddy that one, the or he got second in the world series of poker and I, and I'll never forget it because I was um, I was downstairs and we had this, this, this big villa on the edge of a cliff and I remember not wanting to have sex and I was just like, this is the greatest thing for the first time. Like my Dick doesn't control me. Like I like this is so, you know, this is so nice to just be able to like relax and not like because we had all these chicks running around. I was like banging on the whole weekend and I was like, just not even like half to like think about it because I have no desire to have sex right now. I remember having that thought and being like, wow, this is great and I'm so fucked up that I like took that as a personal challenge to like see if I can have sex. I'm fucking this girl for like 40 minutes on mushrooms on mushrooms. It was the craziest bucket experience ever. I didn't even really enjoy it that much. But I just remember at the end of it I was like, wow, like you had this opportunity where like you were not consumed with wanting to have sex and he could put the fucking ruined it foot.

Speaker 4:          02:51:27       Um, I had a mushroom trip. I was, um, I was with my friend Eddie and we were near a mountain. It was a very high hill. We were below it and we were laying down in the grass just laughing and giggling and I don't know if you've ever, like, if you've ever been like lying down looking up at a mountain range and you see the sky and the clouds go overhead. It was the first time, I think in my life that I really took in the concept of an atmosphere of this shape of the earth being round and that behind that atmosphere, I'm to look it up as blue sky. It's beautiful. But I didn't see the blue sky anymore. Saw it. I knew it was there, but I realized that it's just this layer. And then beyond that is the vast infinity of space.

Speaker 4:          02:52:17       And I remember looking at it and thinking for the first time because of this hill I could see like, oh, like oh my God, we're like in a convertible spaceship. Like this whole thing is a space ship. Like this is an illusion. We're, we're, we're standing here like we're on ground, we're laying down on the grass looking up at the sky, but this is not, this is not sky, this is a thin layer of atmosphere that's protecting you from space. And then above that is there's no end to it. And it fucking stuck in my head. That idea for the very first time. And it's something about being below a mountain and laying down and looking up and seeing them out and seeing the air and seeing the clouds go where it just said into my mind like, well that's an atmosphere. This isn't just the sky, this is a.

Speaker 4:          02:53:04       So I, from that moment on, I can look up at a mountain now and I'll get this weird, almost like half trippy feeling that. That's one thing that I've heard actually about a lot of psychedelics is that it is not like, it doesn't like rewire you, but it just makes you think about certain things differently and I think that they, they explained that there's some chemical thing or kind of like almost like resets you to like where you can have a new perspective on certain things. That's one of the things that I read. I was considering doing acid at burning man this last year, um, because I've heard from a lot of people that it's like, it's more like clean form of the mushrooms and they kinda like got more out of it and I had like 10 people tell me that it was like the best experience or life.

Speaker 4:          02:53:49       And so that's like a pretty strong statement of 10 people tell you that. So yeah, I did it this year for the first time. It's a, I wouldn't say it's like a, it's, it's powerful. I mean they're all amazing. They all have their own little thing that goes on with them. But the um, the changing of perspective is really beneficial to people that have addictions. Like apparently people that smoke cigarettes, like they'll have a powerful mushroom trip and they don't have any desire to smoke cigarettes anymore. It's a really common experience. Drug addicts and you know, even people that probably have other weird addictions like gambling addictions or sex addictions like, yeah. Like I said, I think I had a small experience like that with the sex thing on the mushrooms and it was pretty liberating. Yeah. I mean I think for a lot of people they get trapped in the momentum of the life that they're in, whatever it is. And sometimes psychedelic trips or you know, sometimes for people it's just a near death experience. You almost drowned. You don't drown. You get out of there and you're like, Holy Shit, I got to rethink my whole life. And he just just changes who you are. Like the reset. Yeah. I mean, I, and I've preached this for a long time. I think just so much of your life is just perspective. I mean, it really is. And I, I, you know, a lot of times I have these, um, these crazy part is on

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       white disabled veterans out or whatever and try and show them a good time. And it's one time I, uh, had this one guy who got both his legs blown off in Afghanistan and super cool dude, like really humble, nice guy. And um, there's this like super hot chick that was at the, at the party and I really wanted to fuck her, but I was like, ah, see if she can get her to fuck him. And uh, I, I paid her a fucking ton of money, which is kind of fucked, fuck this guy. And uh, and I, I was, I was fucked up and I ended up passing out and I forgot about it. And the next day we're sitting there at breakfast and um, I was just like, I'm so fucking miserable. And I look over at this dude and almost like, you know, like, what the fuck are you so happy.

Speaker 3:          02:55:42       He's like, smiling and eat this shit and you know, I'm hung over. I'm like, what the fuck are you so happy about? You know, he's like, he's like, shit man. He's like, I feel great. Oh, you're not hung over. He's like, yeah. He's like, I don't give a shit though. And uh, and I'm just like, dude, I got to ask you man. I'm like, he got you got the fucking best attitude. I was like, since you've been here has always been fucking positive. I was like, you know, is it ever like, you know, do you ever have moments where you're just like fucking depressed about, you know, the, the fucking amputation or any of that stuff was exact fuck with you. I was like, how do you like, how do you maintain such a good attitude as I think it's amazing. And he's like, what are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          02:56:17       I was like, losing my legs. The best thing that ever happened to me and I'll just never forget it because that statement was just like, so, like different from what I ever expected this guy to say. Right. And he followed it up with, you know, if that never happened to me, he's like, I'd be over in fucking some sand pit and Afghanistan, I'd just be another number and nobody gives a shit about me. He goes, and then when I came home he's like, I just be, you know, fucking military guy and everybody in my town wouldn't care. And he's like, now he's like, I go and I motivate people and I give these speeches. He goes and people look up to me and I'm inspiring people. He's like, and I get to do cool shit. I just got a fucking brand new rifle the other week for free.

Speaker 3:          02:56:54       He goes to military is paying me. He goes, I'm fucking party in here with you fucked a super hot chick class. I know that. I remembered. I was like, oh good. And then it was just like funny though because like his whole thought process about it was so great and I could just see how another guy, if that happened to them, could easily like get into like the woe is me and the whole like, you know, fuck this, you know, depressed and, you know, think about all the time, like how could this have gone, you know, but this guy just like accepted it, fucking charge with it. And I was just like, he viewed it as like a huge positive. And I thought that was great. I don't know if you've ever seen, um, I got this youtube thing. It's like the story of the Chinese farmer.

Speaker 3:          02:57:36       You ever seen that? No, we're. So he loses his horse and everybody in the town comes over and they say, oh, well that's, that's terrible. And he's like, I'm. And they're like, oh, well that's terrible now, isn't it? And he's like, maybe. And then the next day seven wild horses come back and they all come over and they say, oh, well that's great. And he says, well, maybe the next day his kid is taken out, one of the wild horses and breaks his leg and the whole town comes over and they say, oh, that's terrible. Now in it. He says, maybe the next day the conscription officers come over and they're, you know, taking people into the military to go fight and they pass by his son because he's got a broken leg and the whole town comes over and they say, you know, and they say, oh, that's great now.

Speaker 3:          02:58:17       And then he says, maybe. And the point of it is that you never really know if something is bad or good because you don't know how that's gonna affect the rest of your life. Like back, you know, when I fuck up two days before graduated seal training, I've done 510 days of it. I'll put my fucking heart and soul into this fucking thing and I get kicked out because some fucking guy doesn't like me. And you know, it's kind kinda hard to look at that in any way other than, oh, that's fucking terrible. But as I'm older and I've experienced a lot, I can look at that and be like, well, half of my class died right in combat so I could have fucking died. Um, if I would have became a navy seal, then that might've just been like what I hung my hat on, you know, and I was just like, for the rest of my life I didn't feel like I really needed to fucking prove anything or excel or do anything because I've done this thing that everybody uses great. And you know, I don't know if I would've been as motivated. And so there's just a lot of things like that and your life that in the short term you look at them as being extreme negatives or you know, something that you view as positive that, you know, it's just hard to say until, you know, it's Kinda like run its course and you see what effects that has later on down the line. We're going to end it with some deep shit.

Speaker 4:          02:59:32       Dan Bilzerian, I knew I'd get some deep shit out of you. I knew it was in there. God Damn it. Thank you very much, man. I really appreciate it. It was a lot of fun. Really appreciate it. Uh, obviously instagram. Then twitter, the same. Right? Thanks brother. That was fun. Good Times night everybody. Oh, we'll be back tomorrow with Jesse Ventura. Holy Shit.

Speaker 10:         02:59:53       Cool.
