Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. People are really reluctant to give up fun shit like lying and driving their car fast like those two things. People are gonna have a hard time with you, like actually getting into the, into their mind, seeing their actual mind and being able to do that so we can know without a doubt whether or not someone's guilty or innocent. But my question to you is if you could get inside someone's mind and it was like that really super. I'm a suggestive guy they were talking about earlier that just confessed all the horrific demonic possession stuff and eating babies. What if it's like getting to that guy's mind? What if you can't tell?

Speaker 2:          00:39          Well,

Speaker 3:          00:42          be the case that, that worries me, and this is perhaps an inept segue to politics, but the um,

Speaker 3:          00:54          in people's minds, what you get, you get someone talking long enough, you know their minds. I mean they, they, they can only conceal what they're about a only so. Well, and you can because you're a super smart wizard type. No, but Jamie, I don't know, but I don't know if he's a mind reader, but the question is what will people care, you know, it's like if you, if you have, we don't even need a lie detector. If you have someone who's openly line, right, who, who just gets caught in lies again and again, you could see it too, you feel it, right? But people don't seem to care right in, at least in the political process. And I'm thinking in this case of trump where you have someone who is in, in some cases line or just changing his mind in such an incoherent way that, um, it's the functional equivalent of line.

Speaker 3:          01:46          I mean, it's someone who becomes totally unpredictable. He has a stance that is a on Tuesday and it's be on Wednesday. And when the discrepancy is pointed out, he tells her to go fuck yourself. Right? So it's just, there's just no, there is no accountability to his, his own states of consciousness that he's going to be held to. And the people who love him don't seem to care. They actually, in as far as I can tell, I don't know so many of these people personally, but from based on social media and seeing a few articles where someone has explained why they love trump. People view this as a kind of this sort of this dishonesty, what is, in my view, both dishonesty and a kind of a kind of theatrical hucksterism. I started sort of person who's who's pretending to be many things that he probably hasn't.

Speaker 3:          02:41          They see it as a new kind of authenticity, right? Like this guy, he's just letting it rip. He doesn't care what what is true. He doesn't care what your expectations for coherence are. He's just going to tell you to fuck yourself every which way. And this is the new way of being honest, right? This is a new form of into integrity. It's amazing to watch. It was. It's getting. It has been. I'm someone who actually, I remember on my own podcast, I think I was talking to Paul Bloom, this psychologist who's, who's great and we had taught. We got into politics and this is at least a year ago, but at that point I said, there's no way we're going to be talking about trump in a year. I mean, this is kind of completely flame out, and I was. This is A. I don't tend to make predictions, but this was a clear moment that I remember making a prediction, which is now obviously false, but I just couldn't imagine it that this was where people were going to find this compelling enough to for for him to be on the, on the cusp of getting elected. It's. It is terrifying. Have you taught, have you taught this issue to death on your podcast or. I guess we kind of have.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Well, I think this is how everybody feels. Everybody feels like you're supposed to be like with their person, whether it's Bernie or whether it's for Hillary or whether you're a trump supporter or whatever it is, like you have to be all in, but if you look at the choices that we're given, the. None of these kids really be described as ideal. No, no. Like Hillary Clinton. You could want a woman in the White House and you want to want to show everyone that a woman can do that job just as well as a man and she's got the most experience. She certainly has the most experience dealing with foreign governments and she certainly has the most experience in politics, can make an easy, but she's also involved in to criminal investigations. She had an observer and her bathroom squirrely stuff going on like, no, she's. She's terrible. In many ways.

Speaker 1:          04:34          She was gay marriage, 2013 and then wouldn't admit the change of mind either. She's a politician, she's a brilliant woman, but she's also set in her ways and a politician, a politician to the end and part of being a politician has been a fucking huckster. You got to be able to get those people to see your side and the way you do that is to talk like this. You can't talk like a normal person needs a speech coach. They all do. He's terrible to. Trump's not even good at it and he kicked their asses. I know, but who knows, but her voice or she. She has a kind of, to use the sexist trope, she has a shrill voice when you, when you get her

Speaker 3:          05:16          in front of a mic and there's a crowd and she thinks she's talking over the crowd, which he doesn't have to do because she's in front of a mic. The sound you get is just, it's his. She's yelling when she doesn't need to yell at someone. Someone has to teach her how to dial that back.

Speaker 1:          05:31          What you just did is called mansplaining. I'm explaining to the men and her crew who should, who should talk some sense into her, but she is, she's a, she's a bad candidate, right? I have no doubt that she's

Speaker 3:          05:45          very smart and she's well informed and she's qualified and she is absolutely who I will vote for, given the choices. Um, but you know, I totally understand people's with her. She's a liar. She's an opportunist. She's just almost preternaturally and authentic. I mean, she's just like, she will just focus group every third sentence and you feel that from her. Right? And, and this is all true. And yet, I also believe that people who say I've never met her, but people who know her and I've met her say that, you know, behind closed doors, you know, one on one, she's incredibly impressive and, and great. Um, but that doesn't translate into her candidacy. She probably thinks she has to do it. Old School, you know, I mean, the way she's doing it, but she, I mean, the thing is, she's, when you look at the, what's worked, what worries me?

Speaker 3:          06:36          So I went on facebook the other day and I've said very little about this, but I've made enough noise is sort that I just made that people understand that I, that I'm, you know, for Clinton, despite all my reservations about her, um, and when I got on my own facebook page, which you have to assume is filtered by the people who are following me on facebook and, and already liked me in some sense, just like a thousand comments of pure pain. I mean, no one loves hillary. No one, no one said, oh, thank God someone's, someone's smart is for Hillary. It was all just Bernie people and trump people flaming me for, for, for the, the most tepid possible endorsement of Clinton. All I said was, listen, I understand, you know, Clinton is a liar and she's, and she's an opportunist and she's, um, I, I completely get your reservations about her, but at least she's grown up, right?

Speaker 3:          07:32          And she's going to be the candidate. It's not going to be sanders facilities at the moment. Now is the moment to put your political idealism behind you if you're a sanders person and recognize that there is a vast difference between Clinton and trump and no itch. No, she's not going to change the system, but she's also not going to run civilization off a cliff. Right? And I didn't, I forget how I said it on facebook, but it was just the most. It was just, it really was a lesser of two evils argument. And it just, it was, um, it's amazing to see how energized and passionate people are in defensive trump and sanders. And there's almost none of that for Clinton. It's like people are just sheepishly saying that they do just divulging that they will vote for Clinton. Um, but they are, they may be somewhere that I haven't noticed. Someone loves, absolutely loves Clinton, but it's just, it's. She does not have her defenders the way these guys do. Have you seen the man enough to vote for her campaign? No. No. It's with like hipster dudes with tattoos and beards that are going to vote for Hillary. You know, I hope it's fake because it's so brilliant. I hope it's not real. Is it fake? Is it? Thank God. It's so good though, because it's not that fake. It's pretty good. Like you could almost see.

Speaker 3:          08:52          So wait a minute. I mean, this is not bad for

Speaker 1:          08:56          her, right? This is. No, no, no. It's not bad for. Just funny that someone would make a joke, political ad that you have to be man enough to vote for Hillary. Like there's guys out there that would buy that. They would, they would, they do it. It's a scary time because it doesn't seem like anybody that you would want to be president wants to be president. And so we're left with, all right, what do you pick? It's like as if we're going to play the super bowl with three of the shittiest teams we could find. We're just going to go get some drunk high school kids, get some inmates with club feet. We're just going to throw whoever we're going to have the worst game ever. And this was what this game is. It's not a good game. This is not a game where you've got like a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson or it's not. It's not like like powerful characters. It's trump I guess is a really powerful character, but in more ways like a showman character, what he's doing, he's like, he's putting on a great show and he's going to win probably because he's putting on such a great show and people like a great show. But I do

Speaker 3:          10:07          think I'm now have among the people who think something new, we're witnessing witnessing something new with trump. It's not just the same old thing where the process is so onerous that it's selecting for the kind of narcissist or thick skin person who is willing to submit to the process. And then there are many, the, most of the good people just aren't going to put up with this. I mean, yes, there's that too. But there's, um, there's some, there's a, it's a moment among the electorate where it's like, it's fun. It's an antistatic. There's an ant, there's enough of an antiestablishment mood and vote. Now is it happening with, with sanders to, um, where people just want to jam a stick in the wheel of the system just to see what happens. So it's like, well, this is the main gripe against Hillary really is that she is politics as usual.

Speaker 3:          11:08          She's not going to change the system, right? People want to change the system, but they're not really thinking about the implications of radically changing the system. And in the case of trump, um, I may hear or someone who is, who was advertising his lack of qualifications for the office in every way that he can, like, he, like there's, there is no, I mean, I'm not even, I'm not even bothered by his racism or his misogyny or his demagoguery or is bully. I mean, all of that I'm willing to guess is an act right. That he's decided that that's somehow pandering his base. And he's actually, in truth, he doesn't have a racist bone in his body. Say I'm willing to, to believe that I'm out. I don't know why I would think that's plausible, but it's, it's, it's, uh, you know, I have a hunch that he's far more liberal than he seems and it's just pandering.

Speaker 3:          12:05          But the thing that, that can't be true is there's no way he's actually brilliant and well informed about all the issues and saying the things he's saying. He's not pretending to be as uninformed and as incoherent and as irresponsible as he's seeming. Um, because you wouldn't withhold information that will make you a better leader. Well, it's just, it's. Yeah. And it's just, well, it's just the vacuum busyness of his speech. It's like he's, he'll say that he'll say the same thing three times in a row and it was meaningless the first time, right? He'll say, it's going to be amazing. It's going to be very, very amazing. Trust me, it's going to be so amazing. And he does. He does this with everything. If you look at the transcripts of his speeches and the fact that he can't, he has never so far as I've seen, he has never once strung together a string of sentences that was even interesting.

Speaker 3:          13:06          Right? But he'd be like, he's, he's never. He just, there's never a moment where I read or I say, Oh, this guy is smarter and better informed than I realized that that moment never comes. Or I keep expecting to see that happen. Um, and it's a little bit like my head is this image of like, imagine you have an urn right way and you just keep pulling things out of it and all you pull out of it as junk, right? You pull chicken bones and broken marbles and gum and, and it's, it's still possible that you, that if you root around in that earned long enough, you're going to find the hope diamond. I mean, in each round that you pull something out that really has no logical implication for the next thing you might pull out of a the earn. But mines aren't like that when I see what this guy says, he does not say anything that a well informed, intelligent person would say.

Speaker 3:          13:59          And it's just an ideas are connected, right? So you can't, um, you can't fake this stuff. You can't, you can't fake being this, this uninformed and you can't fake being really well informed and he's just, I mean, we just look at one policy that he wants the, the, the um, uh, you know, the rounding up of illegal aliens, right around 11 million illegal aliens. Now this, this gets stated as, yeah, we're going to round them up and send them back to Mexico. Um, and what worries me is no one seems to care about that. If you just look at the implications of doing this, it has this one policy claim alone is so impractical and unethical. It's just what are we talking about here? You're talking about like your, your gardener, your housekeeper or the person that works at the carwash, the person who picks the that you buy in the market is going to get a knock on the door in the middle of the night by the Gestapo and get sent back to.

Speaker 3:          14:59          The vast majority of these people are, are, are law abiding. People are just working at jobs that Americans by and large don't want to do. And many of them have kids who were American citizens, right? And somebody to say someone's got kids under the age of 10 who are American citizens and what you're going to send that person back to Mexico and you're going to do this by the hundreds of thousands and millions. It's just that one point alone held in isolation from all of the other things. He said. The crazy things like climate change is a hoax concocted by the Chinese to destroy our manufacturing base. And um, you know, the fact that he likes Putin, I mean, everything else he said, write this one policy, claim alone should be enough to disqualify a person's candidacy. It's so crazy with the moment you look at it, and yet no one seems to care.

Speaker 3:          15:50          In fact, he is just, it's just more energizing to the people who already like him. I know that he said that he wanted to build a wall, but I didn't know that he wanted to get rid of the illegal aliens, round them up and around them up and do one with them, send them back to their country is so crazy. That's such a crazy idea. And it's so brutal. The idea that, I mean, it's like a, it's a sub human thing. The only reason why people would come to America as because they felt they felt like it would make their life better. So people take a big risk. It's not an easy way to do it if you're poor, you don't have any qualifications for any unusual job. I mean, you're trying to get across to Mexico, but everybody who does it does it because they want to improve their life, you know, and the idea that one group of people shouldn't be able to do it in one group should just because they were born in the right side of some strange line that is only a couple hundred years old.

Speaker 3:          16:41          But, uh, but I actually, no, I'll go further in meeting him in the middle, whereas I think we should be able to defend our borders, right? So it is, I don't have a good argument for having a porous border that we can't figure out how to defend and we don't know who's coming into the country. Right. So, so I think building the wall is almost certainly a stupid idea among his many stupid ideas, but I think it would be great to know who's coming in the country and have a, a purely legal process by which that happened. I mean, ultimately that's got to be the goal. Right? And we are, we're in perfectly doing that. And um, so I don't have an argument for open borders or porous borders, but the question is, what do you do with 11 or 12 million people who are already here doing jobs we want them to do that help our society, uh, and the vast majority of them are law abiding people who as you say, or just trying to have better lives, uh, the idea that you're going to break up families and send people back by the millions and the idea that you're going to devote your law enforcement resources to doing this when you have real terrorism and real crime to s to deal with.

Speaker 3:          17:54          It's just pure insanity. Right? And, and, and also totally unethical and yet he doesn't get any points docked for this aspiration. I mean, it's just, it's one of the things around which people are rallying. But the climate change thing is also insane and dangerous. Well, he was a birther, right? Yeah, right. He was one of the original birthers. He was saying that Obama's birth certificate was bullshit. He was born in Kenya, right? Wasn't he one of those guys? Oh yeah, he was, he was, um, I would love it if funding that for a while. I would love to, if he got into office and just said, listen folks, I am nothing like this person. I pretended to be to win the presidency. I just wanted to show you that you can be manipulated and get it together. Then at peaches punk to all. So I'm going to hire some people who actually know how to run things and we'll say that's the, the, the smart people who are voting for him think.

Speaker 3:          18:51          And this is, I think an actual, a crazy position. But they, they think that he is just pandering to the idiots who he needs to pander to, to get into office. So He's, he's not disavowing the white supremacists votes, you know, with the, the Alacrity that you would if you were a decent human being and you found out that David Duke supported you. Um, uh, because he needs to. He just, he needs those votes and he knows that, that most of the people in his base aren't going to care and he can just kind of move on in the news cycle. Um, and he's doing this on all these issues where he looked where smart people see that he looks like a buffoon and, and they, and they are treating him as a, the people who don't like him or treating him as a comic figure who he can't really believe that stuff.

Speaker 3:          19:43          He's not really, he's too sophisticated to really believe that stuff. So He's just pandering. Um, I mean, one is people aren't seeing if that's true, just how unethical and weird that is right here. The guy has no compunction about lying and demonizing people. Like let's say he, let's say he thinks that that Clinton really isn't guilty, but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of, of a rape. Right? And now he's calling him a rapist. Right now. At the time he was saying he wasn't a rapist and he's just being defamed. And this is outrageous. He was taking, he was taking the side of a friend who, you know, he invited to his wedding, but now he's, he's calling him a rapist, right? In a sexual Predator who's, who've harmed women's rights more than anyone. I'm so, which is true, right? So, so there's, there's no version of the truth here that makes trump look at all acceptable as a person.

Speaker 3:          20:34          It's like either he knew he was a rapist and was defending him because he was just cozying up to power at that point. Right. Didn't care that he's a rapist or now he, he knows he's, he's still the guy who thinks he wasn't a rapist, but now he just, for purely opportunistic reasons, he's, he's, he's willing to call a guy a rapist who he knows isn't, um, they're both horrible. Right? And it's not like there's new evidence has come forward in the intervening years that would have changed his mind about what happened in, in Clinton's presidency. So He's, um, uh, but I think people think that he's got to be much more sophisticated than he is. And that if he got into office, he would just be a totally sober and presidential person. There's just no reason to believe that it, if he thinks climate change is a hoax and that we should pull out of the Paris accord, then what your ramp up coal production and we're going to bring back the coal jobs. I mean, this is what he's saying, right? There's no reason to think he doesn't believe this at this point. Um, that's just, you know, it is a disastrous thing for a president to think. The only, um,

Speaker 1:          21:48          fascinating versions of this that I've been hearing from people that I respect are that the idea that he is like,

Speaker 3:          21:56          uh,

Speaker 1:          21:57          the political version of the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. Like he's going to come down and smash it and it's going to be so chaotic that they're going to be forced to reform the system. And people are gonna respond in turn, like the way people are responding against factory farming and more people are going Vegan, like that kind of a thing. They're going to see it and they gonna respond in turn. That is such a. So it's like he's going to toss the apple cart up in the air, he's just going to fuck this whole goofy system up and then we'll be able to rebuild after trump has dismantled all the, all the different special interest groups and lobbyists and all the people that we really would like to get out of the system. We really don't like the. The fact that they're such insane amounts of influence that big corporations and lobbyists have had on the way.

Speaker 1:          22:39          Laws get passed that. This might be the way to do it. You have some wild man. Everyone's fired. You have fired. You have fire Jetson. It's like a character like he's coming in. His hair's plastic is all fired up. He's a billionaire. He made all his own money, sort of dad gave him some money, but you turned it into a lot of money. Point being he doesn't need anybody's money. The truth is probably lying about the amount of money has he is, but he's a baller for sure though, right? At the very least, he's got to be worth some cash. Yeah. I made. It could be a big difference between what he's claiming and what is in fact true, but he's, he's a many

Speaker 3:          23:14          pieces here when people assume that because he's a successful businessman, he must understand the economy, right? Which is no necessary connection there, right? There's a lot of rich people who are totally confused about economics and you, most economists don't have a lot of money, so there's no real connection there. But the, um, the, uh, I mean, so what you're describing is

Speaker 1:          23:40          I kind of just random like, like you're just, let's just, let's just smash the window and then see what

Speaker 3:          23:46          happens, right? What I'm going to light a fire to this, this place and, and see what happens. And that's um, it almost any process by which you would change the system is more intelligent than that, you know, and, and it's also not value in how much harm one bad president could do, right? Like there's no, I think even, I haven't tested this, but I'm imagining that even trump supporters would answer this question the way I would hope, which is like if, if I had a crystal ball that could tell you, we can't tell you who's going to be president, but it tells you how it works out for the next president. So like if I, if I look in the crystal ball and it says the next president of United States is a disaster, right? Just, it's like the worst president we've ever had. It just think of, you know, just just failures of governance and, and the toxic influence of narcissism and Hubris that comes along just like once every thousand years.

Speaker 3:          24:46          Right. Just, just disaster. I think, you know, even if you're a trump supporter, which candidate that was like only trump is, is likely to screw things up that badly. It's not. Clinton is going to, is going to be almost perfectly predictable. She's going to be a politician, she's gonna. She's going to be basically centrist on a lot of the, on foreign policy and domestic policy. You know, she's going to be liberal on social issues, um, she is not going to try to dismantle NATO and to get into a war with North Korea or get into an alliance with Putin or image. There's, she's not going to do something insane. Um, and so alliance with Putin. Yeah. He said basically only favorable things about Putin. They're homeless. They're tight, so she get get. Uh, hopefully we'll, we'll see pictures with both of them on horseback shirtless and out of the red shirt on. He'll probably keep your shirt on. I don't see them as being the shirtless guy. I know. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:59          When, when you just look at the landscape between Bernie and Hillary in him and uh, you know, to me it looks like the last gasps of a dying system. So. But that's representative government system for that is a lot of people are saying that things like that, but they're not hearing just how nihilistic that is if. True. Right. It's like there's so much stuff we have to get right and there's so much. And the only tool to get it right is, is having your, your mind actually understand what's going on in the world and how to manipulate the world in the direction you want it to go. So you have to understand like what, whether or not climate change is true, your beliefs about it have to be representative of that truth, right? So like let's say, you know, let's say it's, let's say I'm mistaken and there's, you know, there is no human caused climate change is not a problem.

Speaker 3:          27:00          And every moment spent thinking about it, worrying about it, correcting for it is just a waste of time. That's just throwing out the wealth of the world, right? Um, that would be a terrible thing, right? So it really matters who's right about that and the fact that we have a president or a candidate who is coming in saying, this is all bullshit, you know, in, in defiance of all of the science is, uh, and it's true, but it's on every other problem. He doesn't know anything about it. I guarantee you he doesn't know the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam or which countries are Sunni predominantly in which are Shia predominantly, and I mean, I'm sure he's going to do. I don't know what he's going to cram for this final exam. I'm sure before one of those debates he's going to get someone's gonna sit down with him and give him some bullet points he's got to have in his head, but his head is just not in this game.

Speaker 3:          27:58          It's never been in this game. It's obvious from everything he says and that's what that is. Something you can't say about Clinton, right? For all of her flaws as a person, I don't care how much you hate her as a person. She understands what's going on in the world and that's. That difference is so enormous. Forget about all the other character flaws of this guy who is just obviously going to. I mean he, he's, but are we attached to much to this idea of one person being the figurehead? We figure it out. Someone has to be the decider. If we all woke up today, if everybody woke up and there was just no government, there was nothing more. I'll just. What happened? I don't know, but we've got to figure out how to run this thing. Well, we had no, no previous understanding of government.

Speaker 3:          28:42          Would you think anybody would say, we need one dude to just run this whole giant continent filled with 300 million people? Most likely if we woke up and we had technology like we have today, we have the ability to communicate like we have today with social media and whatever. We would probably say we need to like figure this out amongst each other and find the people that have the most qualified for each one of these positions and start running our government that way. Well that that's what we're attempting to do, but it's just, and I totally agree with you that it is astonishing that out of a nation of 300 million people, these are the choices you would think you would think it'd be starting from your basic, you know, your zero set point of just, you know, now we're going to reboot civilization. Um, you would think that if you had this kind of process, each candidate would be more impressive than the next.

Speaker 3:          29:33          I, you, you'd be like, I can't believe each, each person who came to the podium like James. So yeah, it'd be like, it'd be like the dunk contest for the NBA. I'd be like, oh my God, I could just, when you thought you saw the best dunk in your life, you know, the next guy comes along and it would be that. It would be that on every topic, right? It'd be like you'd be talking about the science of climate change. It'll be talking about the, the actual dynamics of the war on terror. You to topics that, that seem to have no relationship where you would have to be. You'd be amazed that anyone could be an expert in all of them. You would find someone who is an expert, a functional expert in all of them. Agility, winter dude. Yeah. Yeah. But, and, but someone who is also ethically wise who wasn't just wasn't obviously an asshole.

Speaker 3:          30:21          And who, who, who had a, a mature relationship to changing his or her mind. Right. So like the whole bit about flip flopping and not, you know, being someone who could honestly represent changes of mind in, across a political career. Right. This is nowhere written. That is a good thing to believe today, what you believe 20 years ago. In fact that they do that on every topic. It means basically you haven't been in dialogue with the world, but there's something, it's so taboo to change your mind that either you have to lie about it or you have to pretend it was a, it was always that way or it's just a, a, I'm an assistant. Yet the system is, is broken in that respect. But given the choices, you know, and when you have a choice between someone who is for all her flaws, been in the game for long enough to be really well informed and capable of compromise and capable of, uh, not just just, um, breaking, um, the entire machine. Um, and you have someone who's just, he could just kind of stepped off the set of his reality TV show and then lied about everything and, and elbowed his way onto your television set and never left because, you know, CNN couldn't figure out how to give the mic to someone else. Um, it's a, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          31:59          Well, he's a product of attention because they realize that there's the heated race, right? The heated race. This guy was really famous and in a heated race, this guy would say some crazy stuff and so they would tune into them so everybody had to do an intro. So I, because of him saying crazy stuff, he accelerated the amount they were talking about them. So they're constantly talking about him and barely talking about other people. And.

Speaker 3:          32:20          But he's created a worm hole in our political process now where there's nothing so crazy that could disqualify him among the people who like him to. So he can just keep it just like nuclear bombs of craziness that the press can't ignore that the, every time they think, okay, this is the crazy. He said that's going to harm his candidacy, so let's shine a light on it. It just helps him know he could just, he could, you know, he could. He could get on twitter right now and say, you know who I'd like to.

Speaker 1:          32:48          I'd like Nicki Minaj and, and it would work for him. It would work for them. You would use a tweet storm of a billion people who say, I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get her, and it's insanity. That's where we are. But in a sense, if w w we, we do admit that this is a fucked up system. It's not ideal. It should definitely be reworked and it's so hard to rework. Wouldn't the best way to rework it? A trump asteroid just slams right into the White House. Boom. Blows the whole thing sky high. Who knows what terrible things have to happen, but maybe that would be enough. The thing is we have those,

Speaker 3:          33:31          those asteroids are coming anyway. So when you look at like nine slash 11 was an asteroid, right? So it's like a or, or a superbug that, that becomes a pandemic, that these are things that are coming and we need people who are in touch with, with reality to deal with them, right? So like the moment someone advertises their, not only their ignorance, but the fact that they don't care that they're ignorant and they do this again and again, they keep doubling down that person. It's like if you put that person at the helm, what you have done is basically put chaos at the hill, right? It's like this is, this person's going to believe whatever he believes, regardless of the information coming in and regardless of the consequences, that's just, I mean, it's, it's worse than having no one in charge. I mean, because you're, you've, you've put the power in this person's hands, right?

Speaker 3:          34:28          So this, this person is, everything has to go through this node in the network that is just like an information scrambling device, right? So like, know how Matt, no matter how good the information is coming in, you have everything that you've got a bottleneck here which just screws up the signal, right? Um, that's what you're doing if you're, if you're, if you're hiring someone like this, who I'm, I mean, yeah, in the best case, you're what you stated earlier would in fact be true, which, uh, he'll, he'll get into the oval office and even he will be scared about, of the prospect that he is now

Speaker 1:          35:02          running the better part of human civilization and he will hire the best people or some semblance of the

Speaker 3:          35:09          people he can get access to and say, tell me how to not screw this up. And that will be a. and then it'll, then it'll essentially be business as usual, right? In so far as you've hired, the best people will be people. People who are are deeply in this game already, right?

Speaker 1:          35:26          You know, he'll defer to the generals when it comes time to make war. Being real. Really pragmatic about how they pick politicians and how they push certain people and decide not to push others. Do you think that something like trump completely changes how they move forward? Now they realize that this can happen. Like now that you see that people are so goofy were so wwe eat out that you can get this guy, you know, this is, this is where we're at. We've got a guys. I told them the wall just got 10 foot higher. Yeah. Everybody gets crazy. Like how could you say that? Once they realize that that's possible. How long before you get like some motivational speaker type dudes? How long before they start jumping in there? Tony Robbins says, well we, that's what we have. I mean, this is. Oh, this is way worse than Tony Robbins for president. Oh yeah. Way, way, way. Tony Robbins positive dude. Yeah. Yeah, but I'd vote for him. You know, Tony Robbins positive guy. No, that's not what it means, but that sort of ability to excite people to get like one of those motivational speaker dudes like those guys. Whereas a lot of yoga pants and he's going to, he's going to be the next president is going to get us in shape to be a reality show. America is a reality show where there were awesome. We're the best.

Speaker 3:          36:42          Did you see this press conference he held? I think it was yesterday, no, I did not know. There was a very funny moment where the, there was one journalist, I didn't recognize who it was, who gets hooked, so, so trump was being very combative with the press pool and he was, he was basically, you know, shouting them down, not answering any of the questions and one journalist, just a gas said, is this what is going to be like when you're president and is this, how is this going to be like to be in the White House press corps and deal with you? And uh, and he said, yes, this is exactly what's gonna be like. And, but you, you could just see that like the journalists, like they, they, they turn the camera on the room of journalists and they like, they are astonished by what is happening here.

Speaker 3:          37:29          Like they don't know they're participating in this process and in some sense they've created this process. Um, but, uh, no, not all of you. Many of you are enough of us. Is this what you do? Is it, is this what it's going to be covering you if your president? Yeah, let, let me tell you to have this kind of take charge in the restroom. Okay. Yeah. It is gonna to be like this David. If the press writes false stores like they did with this because you know, probably half of you are amazed that I raised all this money. If the press writes fault like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile. I didn't want the credit for raising all this money for the vets. I wasn't looking for the credit and by the way more money is coming in. I wasn't looking for the credit but I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn't raise any money for them. Not only that are raised it much of it was given a long time ago and there is a vetting process and I think you understand that, but when I raised almost $6,000,000 and probably in the end were raised more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in. But when I raised five point 6 million as of today, more is coming in and I. and, and this is going to phenomenal groups and have many

Speaker 1:          38:36          of these people vetting the people that are getting the money and work you play at the moment I was referring to

Speaker 3:          38:44          say here is a case where he's probably almost certainly line about his history of giving to veterans affairs and says he gave money very recently after people started fishing around to see if he actually had given the money that he claimed were given to, to veterans. Um, but, uh, I mean this is. What's difficult about this is that, I mean the PR, yes there are the press is highly imperfect and there and also partisan and there are false stories and there are exaggerations and they screw people over. Yes. And there are reasons to not trust the press from time to time, but the, in this case you have a, someone who the, there is no amount of fact checking and discuss information of his statements that, that forces him to ever acknowledge anything that he's done wrong and the, and the lack of acknowledgement to.

Speaker 3:          39:49          He pays no price for it among, among the people who like him. And so the press is powerless and then, and then, but the net result of like a, of a press conference like this, if you're a trump follower, is he just showed how a biased and and petty the press pool is. Um, and the press do need to just be beaten up by a strong man who, who's not gonna stand for their bullshit. Uh, but it's a, it's a, um, I mean if you, it's unbecoming the very least, that kind of communication. It's kind of unbecoming that person that we expect. And that's pretty mild compared to his, you know, his parody of the, of the, um, the disabled reporter who he saw that bit where he did like a, a, um, a cerebral palsy imitation at, at one of his speeches. He was the. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. He was interviewed by, I don't happen to know who the.

Speaker 1:          40:44          And it was. Roberto was. Oh, he was making. He was making fun of somebody with cerebral palsy. I mean, he's done so many

Speaker 3:          40:51          things that you could, that you would think would be fundamentally canceling of a person's political aspirations. Like you, you can't even cut Marco Rubio pretending to be like a just

Speaker 1:          41:03          goofy on someone's cerebral palsy added at one of his campaign events. Oh, right. One of the things that Ted Cruz was just that video of him with his family. The outtakes where they read into that. Oh, you didn't see it? No, it's a gem. It's spectacular. It's him with his mom and he's like, my mom prays for me often for hours every day, and she was like, she looks at him like, what the fuck for hours every day. No, I don't. He can't even say that. And so they have all these really awkward moments. Like, okay, I'm going to go in for a hug. I'm going to say I love you.

Speaker 1:          41:39          It's all like weirdly mapped out and that got online and people were like, Oh, Christ, okay. See this is, this is a bad game. Like you're not even good at this game. This is you. You're terrible at this game. Yeah. He was objective really terrible. Well, that's his, that's trumped competition. Well, the thing that we'll think about cruise that never even got out, which was the reason to be scared about a Cruz presidency, was his level of religious craziness. I mean, no one was even pushing on that because there was just enough to push on before he even got to that door and you have to hold onto those weapons. But I mean, it hadn't been. Had crews been the nominee, it would have been all about religion. What's, what's odd is that that's not a handicap in 2016 that you can have that and people consider it an asset. Well, the one thing that's

Speaker 3:          42:27          pricing and actually hopeful in trump's candidacy is the fact that he has, he has dissected out the religious, social conservative component of, of the Republican Party. So like evangelicals, for the most part, we're going for trump over crews when it was pretty clear to them that trump was just pretending to be religious and Minnesota. So trump gave one speech at, I think Liberty University where he spoke. He said Corinthians two, um, and you know, that's not the way any bible reader would, would speak about a second Corinthians. How would you say it? Second Corinthians, that's how you'd say it. Yeah. Yeah. And so, so he, so he said Corinthians two, it's as though this is something he just opened every, every night before you went to sleep. And so it is clear that it was clear to them that he's, that he is just, just miming the language, you know, or, or I'm impersonating a person of faith and um, but they don't care really as long as he does it.

Speaker 3:          43:37          And that's, that is, you know, if you're gonna look for a silver lining to this, it, it shows that it's not, it's they just want a space where their religious convictions are not under attack and they don't really care that the person in charge share them. Just if you pretend to share them, that's good enough. And that's, um, that's better than actually carrying that. This person really believe in the rapture or anything else that is quite obviously crazy. Um, but, uh, yeah, so I don't think any Christian who voting for trump thinks, I mean they'll say I'm not going to judge another man's faith, right? Or I'm not. Who am I to say what's really in his heart, right? They'll say that, but he's just given. If you, if you've been paying attention to who he's been and, and if you just look at how he talks about these things, I don't think he's any, any Christian that it. So I think they're willing to vote for someone for it now, for other reasons that are fairly depressing in their own right. They're willing to vote for someone who's, who doesn't really play the game the way they do.

Speaker 3:          44:50          You have to believe in God to be president in 2016. Right? Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you say that? That has to pretend to believe in God. But I think with trump, I think it, I think the pretense is, is obvious enough that I don't think he's fooling the better part of the, of the people who were voting for him, who, who would, who would say they care about a person of faith being in the White House. So I, if anything, he might be in one thing. He might be breaking the barrier on having an atheist president because I think he, it's just nobody. Nobody thinks he is a person of faith. I don't think anyone really thinks that. So he's perfect. He's made. It might be our first atheist president who would help us in that, in that regard as well. Another trump media right into the White House. You, I'm starting to sound like a trump supporter.

Speaker 3:          45:39          Occasionally an asteroid does something good. Who would be the ideal president? I mean like what, what kind of a person? I mean, it would probably be a person who doesn't seek attention. Probably be a person that they could be that. I mean the process is even, even an optimized process will be, um, we'll record. It will require a sacrifice of what ordinary people want, most of the time that it will be an unusual personality who has to get promoted and you will, you will be on some metric be, I mean, it's almost by definition, narcissistic to think that you should be in this role, right? Who are you to think that you should be running a civilization at this moment in human history? Um, and to, for you to be on it, for you to honestly stand at the podium and say, I'm the guy or the woman, I am the most qualified.

Speaker 3:          46:36          I should be doing this. Right? I can help. Um, if you, if you're going to scrutinize the kind of personality that could give rise to those opinions, it's not you. Yeah, there's, there are some dials you would probably want to change, tweak if you, if you had to be married to this person or if it's not an optimal personality. So there's going to be kind of pathology of power seeking that might be just intrinsic to it. But you want someone who is actually wise ethically. I mean, just, just, you're just trying to map that onto trump, right? Just, he's imagined someone saying thing I like about trump is that he is so deeply ethical and wise. Right? It's just, it does not. I mean, it's like saying it's because his hair looks so natural. Yeah. I mean there's just no, um, it is, is the antithesis of what he is.

Speaker 3:          47:34          Right. Um, the thing I like about trump is that he is so well informed about the way the world works, um, and where he's not informed. He recognizes his ignorance so quickly and he remedies that as fast as possible. He, he, he seeks out the best experts, defers to them. Um, and uh, you know, he's just, he's mindful of the limits of his knowledge. Seo As, as he is about his expertise and his expertise is vast. Right. You'd want to be able to say that about a president. You could not begin to say that about trump. Right? Um, you could probably say that honestly. You could probably say that about Clinton, right? Like for Hillary, for all her defects, she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure she will just try it. Where she, where she doesn't feel like she's got the knowledge he's going to try to go to, go to the source of the knowledge.

Speaker 3:          48:31          Right. Just grab the best experts you can find. Um, I think she, I think she will be as aware as you are. I would be of the consequences of not knowing what's going on. Right? She's just going to want to find out what's going on. Whereas this, I mean all trump has advertised about himself is that he thinks that bluster and banality and bullying will win in every situation. It's just like, it's just attitude. He's the guy is the guy is winging it and it could not be more obvious that this guy is winging it on every level. I mean, it's like it's just, it is, it is not there. There'd be no way for him to signal the fact that he's winging it more clearly than he is with everything he's doing. And, and yet there's no penalty.

Speaker 1:          49:24          Do you think it's possible that in this age of information, the way we can communicate with each other that we're going to experience these cycles, these waves, these in and outs, these high and low tides of really smart presidents and really stupid president and we just people revolt and there's just. It's so easy to stay alive is plenty of students who fill out there and so they're only willing to vote for other dme folks, so the other dme folks get into position. They send out the frequency that only the dummies here and everybody else is going, what the fuck is everybody voting for this guy for what is happening, and then it makes the smart people rebound and for years and challenge themselves a new because they. They need some sort of an enemy to rally against to reach their full potential and that without the low tide you cannot have the high tide Sam Harris. That's hopefully. That's not an analogy that applies to the maintenance of civilization. The smell. Yeah. The time man. Maybe at the very least it's a wakeup call for the establishment. This silly game that you've been running have two candidates, just doesn't work. Someone can cooperate your candidacy, get in there, throw the fucking monkey wrench into the gear system, and guess what? Trump's running for president now. He's the. He's the head, he's the head guy for the Republicans. How is that even possible?

Speaker 3:          50:44          They don't know. I met with amazing. It is a way, if nothing else, it has a total wakeup call for the Republicans. I mean they are just, it's June aghast. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          50:52          it's June. Everything's decided locked down. So we have July, August, September, October, November. We're that close.

Speaker 3:          51:03          But he's not someone who has been. Who is aligned with the Republican platform in most ways. Right. So it's like he's been. Truth is virtually no one knows what his policies are because he, he keeps changing his position on things like taxation. It's like if there actually is no keys. He said he's talked to on both sides of, of, of core issue, core Republican issues. But I mean, in many ways he's left of Hillary, right? He's, you know, he's left of Hillary in terms of being an isolationist. Like he's, you know, he, his, his relationship to war is, but both extremes. Like, he's like, no, we're just going to, we're going to get out of the world's business, right? We're going to be isolationists, which is deeply anti Republican. Um, but I'm going to be the maniac who you're never going to know who I'm going to bomb next.

Speaker 3:          52:01          We're going to keep. We're going to wipe out isis. We're just straight away, right? Did Not, not a man left standing. Um, and I'm not gonna take any shit from anyone including China and North Korea. And so he's that. But we're going to pull back in a huge way and not be in anyone's business, right? He said both of those things. Um, uh, it's, it's way too interesting way. We don't want politics to be this interesting and it's going to be November is going to be, if the polls are closed and watching those debates and, and, and, and, uh, waiting for a swing in the polls, as a result, it's going to be, it's going to be way too interesting. That's gonna be like watching the superbowl, those first debates, you know, it's going to be 100 million people watching those debates. I have a prediction. I think, uh,

Speaker 1:          52:58          I think it's entirely possible. This whole thing was a plot that didn't work out. I think he probably came out of the gate saying crazy shit thinking he would tank the Republican Party and get his friend Hillary Clinton into the White House. Did it. Well, she didn't tend to work out. He kept trying to insult her, kept trying to make stuff up about Mexicans and it just kept making them get better and better and now he's stuck.

Speaker 3:          53:23          He can't pull out. That would be. That would be a great moment and that would change the system. Well, we're going to have to go through something like this in order for us to realize that this is crazy, that a guy can just do this, can just not really have any interest in politics. Until then he should get the Nobel prize for everything. If he pulls out at this point and says, listen, I'm just took you to the precipice here, just because I wanted you to recognize how unstable this situation is. I mean, you, you guys could elect a demagogue who is actually an incoherent demagogue. I'm not, I haven't even been playing an incoherent authoritarian, right? I'm, I'm, I'm, uh, on one hand, a very liberal, right and tolerant. And on the other hand, I'm like getting ready to be Hitler and you guys can't figure out who I am and yet you're still prepared to vote for me.

Speaker 3:          54:18          I mean, yeah, for him to do a postmortem on, on his punking of, of the culture, that would be the best thing to ever happen. But I don't think that's, that's what's happening. And we need someone like this. So the, we realized how silly this whole thing is. Do we need. Some are like, no, we need a qualified person to deal with all of the other hassles and dangers that are coming our way that have nothing to do with, with what we do. Like that person's not there. Even if we were doing everything perfectly, they would still be this tsunami of risk and hassle and waste and, uh, just all the rest of the world chaos that is coming our way. And it just forget even if we had our, our house in order, in every respect, we still have terrorism and the global climate change, you know, you have, you've got China and India and what are they doing in terms of complying with, with, um, climate goals?

Speaker 3:          55:23          Uh, you have all the things we've been talking about, the virtual certainty that there's going to be a pandemic at the, the not want to talking about bioterrorism. We're talking about just the sheer fact that in 1919 there was a killer flu and there's gonna be another killer. Flew right? There's just no way. There's not going to be another killer flu. Um, and we need, we need people and we need people, people to smart people to change the, to optimize the system, to deal with these kinds of things. And if we're promoting religious maniacs and, and crazy narcissists and uh, liars, um, and ignoramuses and only that, those people, how could this end will know this is just a weird year for leg heavyweight boxing, you know, they have those weird years for Tony. And then were you were, you could be the heavyweight champion of the world. They went through a period of time

Speaker 1:          56:24          in the early eighties for Tyson, came around, was a series of like these champs that were like, you know, sort of like journeymen fighters. And then Tyson came along. Maybe that's what it is, but only with only with heavy weights, right? Yeah, mostly with heavyweights. Yeah. Yeah. And the lighter weights, they were always bad ass. But I think that maybe that's what's going on.
