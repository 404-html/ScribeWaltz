Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Good. Oh Shit, we're live. Hey fellow. What's going on dude? What's up? And thanks for doing this man. I appreciate it. We both came in here. We had a meal together unprepared. We both were. We both were a little bit late. We both had food. I had a little food, talked a little shit, relaxed, settled in a little nervous like I was in. I was in the right area for the podcast, but when I rolled up I was like, this doesn't look anything like a podcast. And I was nervous that you're gonna. Be like, what the fuck are you? But we will. The next place. I guess it's going to be even less like this place. It's gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Try to make it as discreet as possible. Cool. I'm going to hide it. I'm going to, I'm going to pretend to preschool.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       I'm going to put like a preschool sign on the outside. So that just starts like young single dudes. Just avoid preschools at all costs. That's the way it keeps dockers away. Um, push this sucker right up to your face and okay, so learning a little bit. So Dude, you're talking about a guy who's done a lot of fucking cool shit. You were on one of my favorite shows last up until the end. I got to be honest. Yes, at the end it was. We can talk about fucking Jack your phone or then that guy just driving me crazy standard around that fucking pawn that brings people back to life. Like he's waiting for his line to come up and then you know you, you were part of the Lord of the rings man. I mean fuck dude. You don't know. Those are two amazing historical things that you're a part of when you, when you do it as an actor, as a jobbing actor, when you do it, you stoked.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       I mean, I was super stoked to do those shows. You don't realize at the time the real gravity of what you do and until years later, but we, me and Orlando and Elijah and billy went out for dinner a couple of weeks ago and we've sat around saying the further away we get from Lord of the rings, the more important it feels in our life. So when my grandfathers and stuff, I'm sure it would be like, yeah, we were involved in a piece of movie history, but at the time you just like great job having fun and that was kind of the same at last. Although to be fair we'd lost, cause we were isolated on an island in the show, but also in person, you know, we're all on together. We wouldn't suddenly, I wasn't as exposed to the size of the show as much as when I went on hiatus and then people will follow me around and causing hassle and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       But when you're in Hawaii there's like three restaurants to go to. I avoid those three restaurants. If anyone follows me, I'll go to the library and then sit there for a couple of hours. So I wasn't really aware that it became this pop culture phenomenon, you know. And then the end, the end is like, you know, I'm on twitter and stuff and a lot of people on twitter ask me how'd you feel about the end? And in all honesty, I didn't watch it and I've not watched it. You know, I left at the end of season three, came back in, peppered in season four, five and six, but it wasn't in the show when it ended. I mean I was in the finale, but you know, at that point I had injected myself from that world and I was doing a movie in, in New York, in the lower east side, playing a completely different character, grave robber that was working at night. I didn't want to expose myself to this charlie character who I played because I felt like I was to bring the Charlie character

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       onto set the next day. So people are always very, very jazzed to talk to him about the ending. How did you feel about it? How did it make you feel? Were you disappointed? Did you love it? And I'm always. I always really fucking piss people off by going, yeah, I didn't see it. You didn't see, you know, I just didn't see it because it felt like I was getting fucked towards the end. I was like, I'm not doing this. And I walked away and I actually had an argument about my wife. She's like, you gotta watch the last episode. I'm like, I'm not watching it. Not. I'm not watching it. I'm done. I'm done. I don't feel connected. Same thing with Dexter. I walked away with Dex. I was completely committed in the beginning. But you, you walked away or your, your character died during the golden time of the show.

Speaker 2:          00:03:40       The show was flawless at that time. It was so god damn good. It was so good. Yeah. I like to end the season three, which I really felt like it was kind of peaking at that point was it was the show that every late night talk show hosts was talking about or daytime and it was in magazines and you know, buzzfeed loved it and all that kind of stuff. And then it Kinda felt like it was cresting, you know? And then I think the real bonus for the fens was the, for the six years that it was on tv, the creators that said, it's not what you think it is, it's something else. Ultimately it kind of was. Well, a lot of people thought, well, they, I think they say that they don't know what the fuck they're doing when they have a giant storyboard and they're moving pieces around and they did a phenomenal job though.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       I mean given the constraints, first of all of network television, of knowing that you're going to have commercial breaks and knowing that you can have certain language and certain things, you're not going to be able to show. They did a fantastic job. I mean it's just one of the all time great shows for sure. Totally a great show. Loved it, loved being involved in it. I think it will be, you know, something that people will talk about with me for the rest of my life. A lot of times. I'm sure you experienced this as well. Sometimes the things that you up personally close to that you're working in is a huge part of your life. It takes on a different aspect than just these simple look from a fan's point of view. Like for me last was, it was Hawaii. It was surfing, it was being in love.

Speaker 2:          00:05:09       It was chameleons. It was having a shitty day at work. It was having a great day at work. It was being hung over. It was making new friends. It was everything. It was my life, you know, for a lot of fans. It's like, oh, that's the TV show that I watched Wednesday night at eight. And it was always my friend, but lost for me was sometimes not my friends. Sometimes my enemy sometimes he was incredible sometimes, you know. So when people come up to me and say, what do you think about the show? How do I make sense that it's, it's so much of me. Do you know what I mean? Your, your point of view is completely singular. I mean, no one is going to have that point of view other than the actors on the show and even their point of view is going to be kind of different than yours.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       Yeah. People watching and they watched the finished product and so their association with is totally different than yours. Polished, beautiful. There's no agenda. They just wanting to be entertained, you know? Uh, you know, no politics. There's a lot of politics on. Last, I mean fuck, I got in trouble for saying this when lost was on tv, but fuck it, I don't care about that shit. I watched, I watched certain cast members go from making the pilot, which was a six week pilot where everyone was hanging out with each other real pie in at night. We were all spending time with each other. I watched her and act as be like, this is the greatest job I have ever done. I'm in Hawaii. Is a tropical island getting paid? Well, the Castro amazing. We're going on this journey together to shoot in like episode three or four of the first season and hearing people saying, I can't believe I'm not unless Letterman, why am I not on Letterman?

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       You're like, two months ago it was the greatest thing you've ever done and now you're like, why can't fly to New York? Why can't I be on a 12:00 flight to New York? Why do I have to be on a 9:00 AM flight to New York? What the fuck is wrong with you? You're missing it. You're missing it. You know? That's so common though. That's very common with actors. Actors are strange breed. When I was on news radio, we once had this discussion about Thursday night, Thursday night lineup on NBC was where you wanted to be. That was Seinfeld, that was friends. That was the spot and it was fucking sex in the city and the single guy. And he's what? Paul Simms, the creator of a news radio called the shit sandwich spot. So like you have your two good shows and in between your show you would put dog shit and um, everybody was complaining, why can't we be on Thursday?

Speaker 2:          00:07:23       And I'm like, guys, last time I checked we're on television, like we're on a sitcom on actual television. And it's funny, like these are the golden years, like we're going to look back when we're old and we're going to say fuck, we were so lucky. But while it's happening and everybody's like, why am I not in the Hollywood reporter? Why am I not getting a development deal? Why can't I start my own movie? And what, you know, why did he get it? And I did that in my teens and early twenties. But how come he's got it? And my agent knew, um, the, my English agent knew I'm not with anymore. At one point, you know, we lived in and he sent me down. He was like, the reason why he's getting it and you'll know it's because you are not him. He has a completely different journey in his life.

Speaker 2:          00:08:05       He looks different, yanks different. You're not the same. He won't get the roles that you're going to get. He won't get the opportunities that you'll get and you won't get his book quit that bullshit because that's not to get you anywhere. A great perspective. So true. It's hard to find someone to lay it down like that. My agent was not only. That's great. You had a good guy. He was, he was really good. And then you have to absorb it, right? You have to take it in and you have to separate it from your ego and all your preconceived notions and assumptions and actually absorb it. Right? And also swallow that very bitter pill of regardless health of however unfair you think it is and how it should change and be justified in one day it will be okay, maybe it won't. And that's really, I mean we're talking about one very specific endeavor, but it's analogous to life itself because people will look at people that are doing other things life and there'll be

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       upset that they're not doing those things even though they've taken very little or no effort to try to do any of those things. Right. It's just, they, they become haters know. And it's crazy that even a successful person like honestly a huge show like loss can become a hater.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       Oh yeah, yeah. Totally adorable. I mean, it's kind of funny. I mean, it's a human characteristic, right? We're always going to compare ourselves to other people. I went for a walk yesterday around Griffith Park and I was talking with my friend about the whole comparison thing and I was saying like, you know that Bill Gates gets up some days and he's like, what the fuck? No, Jesus Christ, I can't fucking catch a break, you know? Just having a shit day, all your problems or relative, you know, and it's okay to have them, we're all going to have them. It's just you got to navigate your way through them with a little bit of grace and it seems like those

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       pitfalls in life or just a part of being a human being in this weird world because this world is not like any world that was ever that ever existed. There was never a million different people that you could compare yourself to that were on television or singing songs or on the internet or like there's all these different people that you can look at and then you look at yourself and make these comparisons. It used to just be the people that were around you and that's what it used to be for the entire history of the human race. It was only the people you could see with your eyes and come in contact with other that you didn't have. This weird perspective and I think it's part of what a human being is. We we're constantly striving to improve. It's a why we stay alive. It's why we build homes. It's why we try to get good at a career. It's like this, this desire to get better at things also leads you to compare your own progress against the progress of others and that's where the pitfall comes in.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       Right? And obviously a lot of people in in this new society that we've created with social media and instant information, a lot of those people that have become successful and famous are in those places because they are the fucking elite. So now we're comparing ourselves to the elite. Like you could be a great basketball player. I have an amazing game. Come home, stop watching youtube feeds of Dwayne Wade, you know Lebron, and you're like, oh, I'm fucking terrible. No, you're not terrible. These are the exception. And we're exposing ourselves to the exception almost all the time. Now everyone on twitter is brilliant. You know, everyone in that sense, those comparisons are great and beneficial because they force you to try to achieve a higher standard. As long as you can keep yourself from going mad. Um, what about the fact that you'll never get there? Like, I'm never going to slam dunk.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       I've never, I don't have the athletic body ability to slam dunk, so if my whole ambition was like, I want us London, I know Boykins can slam dunk. He smaller than me, I can't do it, I just can't do it. You know I've tried. I'm don't get anywhere near. I don't have the ability to do is now. How much have you tried? You know what I mean? Like if you went to a strength and conditioning coach, he said, listen, I'm Dominic Monaghan. I got a lot of fucking money. Come on bitch. You're going to get me in fucking top notch shape. Going to do dead

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       lifts. You're going to get me pumped up with steroids. I'm Duncan, dude. I'm fucking done. What is it that the vertical leap leap down? Maybe I'm not trying to the extent that, you know, some people have, but I don't know. I think there's, I think there's something potentially harmful. You know, it's like the whole thing with beautiful women. You know what I mean? A lot of people, a lot of ladies and maybe men feel that pressure to be that perfect thing, but that perfect thing isn't necessarily real well. You know what's really frustrating when you meet a girl who doesn't like her body and you love her body and she's comparing herself to stick figures that are like in models that are wearing these weird outfits that way 18 pounds on your body is a woman's body. The fat, the stuff that you don't like, weed like that.

Speaker 2:          00:12:36       Like a fat ass. Yeah. I mean it's a part of being sexy. Yeah. It's like it's, it's a, it's actually attractive to men, but women are comparing to the way fashion models look and the way other women perceive. Like there's certain women, like I know this lady who she doesn't think that women look good unless they look like sticks. Right? Like she has this weird thing in her head and like her friends would try to talk to her about it. Like that's not true. And, but after awhile you just get tired of talking about crazy. Look, you look great. Really Great. Like don't this, this ain't about that. You could be born in Ethiopia with no feet, you know, you could, you could have been fucked. You could have been one of those kids that's born in Iraq that has to deal with the aftermath of all the fucking hazardous waste.

Speaker 2:          00:13:19       It's in that area that's causing all these kids to be born with massive deformities. Like you're lucky shit. You can't go on about the fact that you're not skinny enough. I mean, obviously a lot of that is the, is the societal thing may not make a big distinction between like a girl's body and a woman's buddy. You know what I mean? There is a difference. Most of the fashion lines, one to put that models in the clothes when they have a gills buddy, because there they were calling. Yeah, a coat hanger. That's the way to look at it because that's what they really are there. Clothes hangers, like your clothes look best when they're not being stuffed into like Jennifer Lopez. His body was fucked. But to a man like that's what men like to see that fucking ass waist. Jesus fiance. Yeah, exactly. That's a fucking woman, yes, but the, you know, those women we were talking about this the other day, like that didn't used to be hot, like just a few.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       Like if you go back and look at the playboys when like the seventies and the eighties, they didn't even concentrate on assets like it wasn't for whatever reason. That wasn't a focus on what happened or do we think it's the hip hop community? Do we think it's. The wrapper is brilliant. I mean, I remember being 12 and seeing a cover of an ice tea album that had like one onesy bikinis with big assets. Oh Damn, that's true, right. That one where ice had a machine gun behind his back and the girl was in a bikini and she had. Yeah, she had a thong on. He may have ended up marrying a man. I think he did. I think that was his wife for awhile before he got rid of her and got the cocoa right. And that was the first time I was exposed to that,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       you know, because for me it was like Princess Leia growing up was my thing, my jam.

Speaker 4:          00:14:57       We didn't even know what her body looked like. We had no idea there it is. But even then, harass. Yeah, in comparison to today, it's not quite that, but at the time that was kind of revolutionary. I'm not hating it. It's not terrible, but that's nothing compared to, you know, what is her name? The fucking Nicky Manila to go right here on power. Similar just to the right. Then that goes click on that one, which I bought that. That's much more wrapper, but it's what's interesting is it seems the attraction to that seems fundamental. So why wasn't it there in the seventies and the eighties? It seems genetic, right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       Was it seemed to be. I don't know. Obscene. Oh God. This folk hero.

Speaker 4:          00:15:41       Her ass is retarded. Nicki Minaj. Anaconda picture. Like what is that? Is that real? Yeah, I think so. Wow. A little extra brush and. But yeah, maybe. But whatever. That's insane. It's phenomenal what genetics, but again, like Andale obviously it's a lot of it is girls doing squats and girls concentrating on that area and developing their butt, but I just. It's weird to me that that wasn't a big deal in the seventies and the eighties and whatever, and then somewhere along the line the hip hop community sort of ignited what seems to be a fundamental attraction that men have. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       Also like, you know, when I started to get interested in girls and being able to actually make out with girls and spend time with girls, those girls were girls that was, you know, 11, 12, 13 year old. There was no concept of any of those girls having a Ba donk, donk like that. So maybe for me it was the thing that I was reaching for. I'm never gonna get them never going to get this womanly thing. I'm going to be with these little waifish girls because I was a little kid at the time. And then later on, I don't know, there's a, there's a fantasy element to it. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:16:51       But why? Well, for girls though, the look of a man being like a big muscular, like the rock or something like that, that's always existed like Conan the barbarian and you know, that's always been around. You go back to the Robert e Dot Howard, illustrations that Frank Frazetta did like way back in the seventies is fucking yolked out, giant barren. It's universal Roman Greek gods, sculptures that have been around forever. They're all cut and ripped and stuff, but the women back then were all fat and Rubin ask, you know, they didn't have those bodies. The bodies have today is like a weird change and it doesn't exist in the mail. So it exists in women. Yeah. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:17:29       Yeah. That is interesting. I mean I, you know, I appreciate the lady that kind of takes care of itself simply because I feel as if I need to, you know, I, I'm not the biggest dude in the world, but I go to the gym when I'm free because it gets me out of the house and also I like to try and go to the gym Monday to Friday so that my Saturday, Sunday I can do whatever at one and I eat relatively correctly so that on the weekend if I want to chow down some food, there's a little noise. It's not going to make a huge difference if I'm doing that. I would like to be with someone who has the same common sense about the body and the way that they look like it's a, it's a bit of, it's a bit of an issue, but for me because like I love pizza and I like buffalo wings and I could easily eat all that stuff and, and get much bigger, but I'm aware of the fact that it's not healthy for you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       You shouldn't necessarily be doing that to your body putting you under that much stress, but also I want to feel and look and present myself good because I want to feel good about myself and the issue with people just kind of abuse in themselves in that way. Excuse me. Says something a little sinister about how they personally feel about themselves. Self Abuse, right? I mean if you, if you know the food is making you more unhealthy and you're eating on a daily basis, that is a form of self abuse and I don't necessarily feel attracted to people who are abusing themselves on a consistent basis.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       Yeah, I mean that's natural, but it is. It's also weirdly natural for people to abuse themselves to get caught in that cycle of overeating and then feeling shitty because you're overeating and that's a very common cycle for people get trapped in and I really wonder what the mechanism of that is like what's the, what's the evolutionary advantage to having that in the human species? Because it's so common. I mean, everywhere you look, especially in America, she just see overweight people everywhere. They know. They have to know. It's not like this is some secret that's locked up in the fucking vaults in Qumran. You have to crack the code to find out that you shouldn't eat pizza at 3:00 in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       Right. And they don't suddenly wake up and go, oh my God, what is this? This. They've seen it occur. I don't. I don't think that's the evolution of us species. I think that's those moments where we do want to abuse herself. We do want to feel badly. It doesn't, it doesn't extend us as a species. To me it's, you know, it's the way that we feel that, but light you, you eat relatively healthy, you work out and stuff. Like what's your food? Kryptonite? What is the thing where you look at. Oh my God, I love it. I gotta have it.

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       Um, I do love pizza. I do love Shitty pastas and pizzas and things that I know that I shouldn't eat. That's pretty much it, but I'm pretty good because I, I enjoy healthy food. Like I had, I was eating Vegan food when he came in here because I want to, you know, because I just did yoga and I'm like, uh, that's a good thing to eat. So it feels good.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       Do you give yourself like a free pass? You're like every Sunday I can have a slice of pizza. I

Speaker 3:          00:20:26       don't though. I do, but I kind of would, if I was more inclined to eat shitty, like if I was, if it was like more of a thing that I had to separate myself from, but it's not that hard for me. I eat relatively clean because I like to eat relatively clean. I mean, I honestly relatively clean, I shouldn't say overwhelmingly clean. Most of the food I eat is really healthy. It's just, I just, I know too, you know, at this point in time I'd be upset at myself if I didn't. I just know too much about the actual effects. So the mornings generally in the mornings I either eat fruit or I eat a drink, a Kale shake, you know, one of those, a blended up shakes with Kale and celery and cucumber and garlic, all that jazz. Um, and then in the afternoon it depends. But if I feel like having a cheeseburger, I'll have a fucking cheeseburgers. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       yeah. Well, you know, we were talking about this stuff that like, I, excuse me, I'm lucky enough to travel nine months of my year pretty intensively, you know, a week in a place, 10 days in a place, a week in a place, 10 days in the place. Because of that, lots of long distance flying. I have no semblance of a schedule in terms of food. So I lose weight based on those factors. And also the fact that my metabolism metabolism is very high running, I need very little sleep to function if this my mommy's tummy, this all the time. And I was a kid. If there was something more interesting for me to do, I would forego eating. So she'd be like, dinner's on the table. I'd be like, wait, can I just finish this thing? She was like, okay, fine. And she said you would just not have dinner and then she would have to remind me you didn't eat dinner.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       And I'm like, okay, let me. And then I'll go back to that thing. So you would eat just like NASA, like a necessity pleasurable thing. I just got to get into your mind, just get it down because my mom and dad told me, I mean I would, I was obsessed by football, soccer when I was a kid. I would get up in the morning, run out my house when I was going to school right at my house before breakfast, no breakfast, get to school, play football for an hour before 9:00. So from eight til nine and play football with my friends. Break time was 10, 15 to 1115. Most people ate at that point. Most people had a snack chips, fruit sandwich. I would play football. Lunchtime was an ally. All my friends would eat. I would play football first thing that I would put in my mouth, pretty much all.

Speaker 1:          00:22:35       It's certainly more than average in school. Like I would say 65 percent of the time would be candy on the way home. So I'd walk into the convenience store by, by one lbs. With a candy. Must have been starving. Dude. I was amazed when I was a kid and I was burning what I dunno, 10,000 calories a day and just putting sugar in me, you know, so I was super skinny and that has transferred over into my adult life. Where my trainer has always said to me is consistency. Dom, like you need to be in the gym five days a week. So I'm like, Okay Ryan, I'm here for a month, let's do five days a week and get it poppin. And he's like, okay, cool. And then like three weeks in, I'm like, I'm not like I put on a little bit, but I'm not feeling it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       And he's. And he says, let's talk about what you're reading. I'm like, couple of mouthfuls of oatmeal, breakfast, some pine and pool and some grapes for lunch. She's like, no, no, no, no. You need tuna steak. You need salmon, you need chicken, you need Tofu, you need fat. You need to own the genie, the Avocados. And he would show me what I'm supposed to be. I'm not connie either. I can't get it in my system. I'm going to Puke. But you know, everyone's got their own thing that they're dealing with, but I'm never going to be as big as you. Your frame is bigger and you're just, you're, you're naturally big guy. What my train said is like you can get caught, you can get Bruce Lee ish, but you're never going to get John Claude van damage. But the way to do that is to still eat food.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       That fire. Or if you did want to pack weight on, you would have to do these big compound exercises like deadlifts. You'd have to do squats, you'd have to do things where your body literally has to change your body. Your bone structure has to change. Your bone structure will change. I mean, it will densify it. You did. The density of your bone structure definitely alters when you do heavy, heavy lifting because your body realizes, hey, this dumb mother fuckers going to pick up big, heavy shit all day. We have to get thicker. So it makes you, it literally will make your bones thicker and denser.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       I want the biggest I ever asked. Can you pull up the. Can you pull up the, um, the poster for the pilot of lost, like the first ever poster philosophies, all of us on a beach. The biggest I ever was, I was probably like 158 pounds. Something that, which is big on me. I put on like 12, 14 pounds of muscle and my fucking biceps like this. And I never got that big ever again. And at the time, what were you doing a. no, it's like a more of an iconic silhouette on a beach. Hang on. Oh Jesus. Okay. Uh, what was I doing? I was, I had food delivery and the food and the food delivery was like, I'm going to the gym, give me clean food, give me lots of clean food. I was in the gym once a day and then I did a little bit of running around my local area and it was consistency. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 3:          00:25:21       Consistent. It's about getting a good groove gone, right? It's about just getting a good habit going or this is what you do. They say that if you could do something every day for 90 days, then it will become like a part of you to become like they say that that's one of the best ways to quit smoking is if you can get addicted to something else and get, get used to doing that every day.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       Yeah. Yeah. But there's a slightly high res version. You can't really see it, but I am huge death of me. I mean I don't look cute because I'm not the biggest guy in the world, but like you can. Well I can see at least let my fucking. I see some muscle now. My biceps are going off right there.

Speaker 3:          00:25:55       Was there any hesitation at all being sequestered on this island like that and being a part of this crazy show where you had to change your whole life? I mean, you had to move.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       Yeah. I met Jj Abrams and he just, he just solved all of those conundrums foaming how? So He's just a brilliant guy, you know, you meet brilliant guys every so often and I think anytime you're around someone who's brilliant, you have to sit up and take notes, you know, and I just was aware that I was around someone with a very fast moving smart mind and I went in for a general audition and sat down with Jj and his partner Brian Burke and we just told about English comedy for like 45 minutes. Talks about Monty Python, Eddie Izzard and uh, the goons and the goodies and Derek and clive and we did this whole thing. We, we're doing impressions for each other, no audition. And I left and I called my agent and he was like, how did it go? And I was like, it went well, but we didn't talk about the show.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       We just talked about comedy and goofed around and stuff. And he was like, all right, cool. Then they got back in, touch them and said we loved, um, they had this character of Charlie who at the time was this 55 year old rocker, like a, like a Robert Plant guy at the time that had been through all of it and was in the tail end of his career and got stuck on the island and they reworked it. And when Jj and I sat down, I was like, what is more frustrating for the artist to have the barest glimpse of fame? You've got this one hit. And it all almost worked out his entire life. It almost did it for him and it was on this fucking island and he can't get back to the place where he could make it all happen. You know? And I think, you know, Jj love responded to that kind of frustration level.

Speaker 1:          00:27:43       And I was just aware that it was gonna be a big deal. He directed the pilot. He Co wrote the pilot, it felt like something that was gonna be, you know, big and impressive and I trusted him. Um, and there wasn't a huge amount when, when it's a, when it's a no brainer job like that, it doesn't take a huge amount of thought. You're just like, well yeah, of course I'm going to do it. There's no living in Hawaii would be a really tough decision to make because I wouldn't mind one day living in Hawaii, but I would have to be really done with cities. I could just done like, I need something different in my life. I bought, I got a job. They want you to move to Hawaii. Bill. Ooh Boy. I don't know. It's. Did you get island fever vault? You know, I actually didn't.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       A lot of people in the cast did. I'm into jungles and forests and animals and stuff. So for me I was kind of buzzed enough that I had said to them before I moved out there because they were putting this in houses. I was like, can you put me in the jungle? Can you put me straight up in the jungle, in a house, the surrounded by trees and animals and because they didn't know me, the producers like, you don't want to do that. You're going to be isolated, you're going to be on your own is going to be nothing around you. That's exactly what I wanted to do. So I ended up moving, living in Kailua for a little bit. Then moved to Atlanta guy for a little bit with Atlanta. Kai. Lenny has this loop. It's a little half a mile loop, very exclusive little part of the islands, south east part of the island.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       Um, Michelle pfeiffer has a house there, so I was able to watch her go on a daily run every day, which is pretty fantastic. Lives there, Huh? I think she has like a summary place around there. She's still, oh my gosh, you're so cute. Some little as well. She's doing well at the time. She's probably in her mid forties, mid fifties at least. Yeah. Maybe still hot. So hot. She'd wear a little, you know, cycling shorts and a little like running thing. And I was like, oh. She say hi to you ever. No, I never said hi to read them. Make sure that I was just watching out the window in my binoculars. Fucking citing scope. Right. But Hawaii was, you know, it was, it was cool. I liked it. I was, I learned to surf in New Zealand, which is a gnarly place to serve very cold waves, relatively dumb p waves.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       There's no curl on that wave. It just picks you up and drops you. Which if it's the first time you've ever served it, you assume all waves of light that you have to be in a wetsuit. Last time you had to be in buoys. Uh, there were times where it was so cold out. Come out of the water. They'd have to use two hands to unlock my car door because I couldn't use one hand. It would, it had frozen, you know, so I'd have to go. Wow. Meanwhile, you moved to Hawaii boardshorts after wear tee shirts, water bottles everywhere. I don't think so. I was big on surfing and in the first month or so that I was in Hawaii, I went to the apple store in Honolulu and uh, I met one of my favorite surfers of all time. I got called Kalani, rob, and when I was playing Kelly slater's pro surfer game, I would always pick Kalani because he did the most radical moves, you know, so I'm in the apple store, he's there with his boys.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       I was like, shit, that's Kalani Romp. And then he comes up to me. He's like, Dude, you're that guy in load the rings. I was like, Oh shit, it's on now. So I was like, you're Kalani, rob. I was like, I'm here for like nine months, can you help me out surfing? He was like, yeah, we're going to go to the no show now. So I came with him, hung out, uh, and we became really tight. So a huge story for a while. For me it was getting to know Kalani. I mean he taught me into waves. I had no business being involved in. There's a place called goat island on the north shore, which is a heavy wave and you have to paddle out to an island, walk across the island because then you're going to miss the break and then paddle out past the break.

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       There's no concept of you're paddling out through the break because it's so big. So as with Kalani and a few of his mates and we were all getting ready and he came over to me, he was like, okay, this is the most hectic wave and ever going to take you into. Stay close to me. If you need help, let me know. Don't fuck around because it can kill you. And don't go left. Go right. No, no, don't go right. Go left because it's gonna appeal left. But if you go right, you're in the braking zone and you're fucked. I was like, alright, cool. So sense of fucking terrible story coming out. So we. So we paddle out and I'm having fun and I'm watching everyone in the lineup on about 10 feet away from the drop zone. So I'm able to like sit down on the wave and watched people like get on the side.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       I'm like, alright cool. I got this fast, I'm going to, I'm going to take it. So I paddled, I battle a battle with, picks me up big like Oh shit, super powerful drops me and I really try and go left. I like cut the board and then try and go left. But it's so powerful because breaking here on my left that it spits me to the right. I'm fully aware that it sent me to the right. So I'm like okay shit, I'm just going to wipe out, take a big breath and paddle out. So I wipe out are going to come up. And as is usually the case with, if you're surfing anything above overhead, when you come up that wave's coming

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       for you against what you have to do is take a huge breath, go under and it's the next time you come up do you can make progress because your out breath, you disoriented. I do that and Joe, I just can't. I can never catch a break. So I go under, thrown around by the washing machine, come up the thing, okay, get on your board, start paddling, look where's right there. I'm like, oh, go and drink in, hold my breath, come up again. And I'm trying to time it so that I can get it. I just getting pounded, pounded, pounded, pounded. And at one point I see Kalani paddling over to me. I'm like, all right, cool. We're going to be okay. So Kalani comes up to me and he's like mad, like I've never really heard him you metaphor. He's like, Dude, get on your board and go that way.

Speaker 5:          00:33:15       I'm like, okay, that's what I've been trying to do for like 10 minutes. But so now he's behind me. He's paddling, I'm paddling, he's pushing me, paddling, pushing me, paddling like fucking superman. And we eventually get out past the break. So he's like, all right, you going to sit here for 20 minutes and then when I'm done you're going to paddle in with me safe. And I was like, okay, fine. I got it. So when we come in, he's like, the reason why I came in to get it was not only were you in the drop zone but you were like completely lacking of any color on your face. And he was like, people in the lineup was saying, dude, go get your boy because he's in trouble. And I was like, I was handling it. I was definitely out of breath and a little fucked up, but he's a wharton.

Speaker 5:          00:33:53       Then he was like, no, eight more waves on your headlight that you wouldn't have had the strength to fight past the wave and get up here because you get these little gas. Dude. It's so heavy and it has a really good trick. Colone told me this one. He's like, if you're under the water and you're rolling around and you fucked and you need to take a breath, drink the tiniest amount of seawater. Tiny sip. Just go like that. Tricks your body into thinking you took a breath and it'll give you an extra five seconds. So because you've just taken an in, well not an inhalation, but you've, you've put something in your body so your lungs are like, okay, we can chill. The panic goes for a little bit. Yeah. And I've done that a few times I'd been under and I'm like think a little swollen. Come back up. Wow.

Speaker 4:          00:34:33       Oh, how weird. Funny you fighting for five second increments to. It's so hectic. Surfing seems crazy. I mean, you never done it? No, never done it. Oh, you look like someone that can handle it. I mean you need a, you need a big book, but you're an athlete. You can handle it. Yeah. Seems like a lot of work. It also seems like something get addicted to. I'm scared of things that you get addicted to really addicted to work. Oh yeah, exactly. I just don't have any more time. I'm just so afraid of some new thing in my life that I get addicted to. And then I just think about it all the time. I go through different sessions and stuff with certain things, but what's so what's

Speaker 5:          00:35:06       like, you're doing this thing right now on instagram with the rock where he's fucking lifting up kettlebells and you're lifting up kettlebells. Are you guys tight? Do you know each other? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:13       No, I don't ignore them online. We were pals. Right, okay. You know, and we uh, we share, you know, we have friends and he's going to do the podcast eventually we're working on because his company, one of his companies that he, he's involved with is the roots of fight this, a company that does all these old fight poster tee shirts. Really Cool Shit. Excuse me. And he's always wearing their stuff and he's coming in town to do with them. So

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       you know, somebody in San Andres and said he was a lovely dude. Oh, you're supposed to be the best guy. Super friendly, knew everyone's name, really accommodate and well, he's the real deal. Like he's really does get up at 5:00 in the morning and workout before the set. He takes all these instagram photos. He's like the most inspirational guy when it comes to like getting shit done. Yeah. Because he just gets shit done, you know, beast as well. Fucking animal. He's making it happen. There is Samoan, right? Somebody has some genetic stuff that he's definitely got some genetics though. He's a giant dude. He's a fucking animal man, but he's very motivated. See that shirt that he's wearing. That's a route to fight shirt. That's the tie. Yeah. Yeah. They have a lot of really cool old school. Different like fight posters from like Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       Thrilla in Manila. Like Nice Shit. Like he's, you know, if I would see a guy that big on the street light that it would be kind of freakish, but for some reason the ruc pulls it off. He's very proportionate. Yeah. He knows what he's doing. If you scroll down lower, that's another route to fight shirt. Scroll down. Lower that John Fan going. That's a. that's a Bruce Lee shirt. He's got a bunch of these. I, he's an animal. Yeah. Hey, I'm cardio. Fucking animal. Good for him. Yeah, I mean look, there are people like that, like Kevin Hart is stand up, he's another one, very inspirational guys always doing something. He's up 5:00 in the. My, yeah, he makes these little videos of him doing anything very good shape. He works out every fucking day and he puts instagram photos of and he's a comedian. He's constantly getting things done.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       I don't think they found the right vehicle for men. No, his standup is the right vehicle for all those other things. The movies and everything was great. Just making them more famous and bigger. But his standup is where it's at. Yeah, he's got to find it. I, uh, you know, friends with Kimball, Kimmel, Kamal's always impressed me just in terms of like knowing what his day's like, but also the fact that he'll reply to me pretty quickly. I'm like, dude, on, you're doing 15 things at the time. He's like, well, yeah, I am by, you're the 16th thing that I can do. You know, I just really impressed by his work ethic and it's very often the same, the routine of going into the studio and go and in the writer's room and breaking jokes and doing the monologue and only because it's the same every day, but he's still of a to do it and he's brilliant and he knows what's funny and he knows what the joke is and I don't know. Those are the older, late night tv, older, late night talk show hosts that I've had the opportunity to meet. I've always thought there's something brilliant about you. You know, there's something brilliant about working in that medium, you know, it's, it's current and edgy and you know, what they're doing at times can be a little risky and dangerous and stuff, but they're willing to get out the next day and do it again and get the next day and not get pounded down in the same way that other people might. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       That's their thing. You know, I mean, that's what Jimmy Kimmel is best at. He's, he's got, obviously, he's got a fantastic work ethic and he's obviously a brilliant guy, but that's what he wants to do. His thing, you know, like it works for him. It's a beautiful gig too because you can never rest on your laurels because it doesn't matter. Tomorrow there's another show that show has to be good as well. Like can you need new jokes and you need new sketches and you need new gags to pull off and you have new guest to review and to go over what they're talking about. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:39:04       And he's done a lot of jumping up Jimmy in a way that I really respect. Like I did a show a long time ago, maybe 12 years ago and at that point, you know it's has different. It's a little bigger than, oh, quite gray suits to fit yet the whole facade of the show, you know, he was being worked on, but Jimmy, I think his drive and maybe the drive of the people that he surrounds himself with, you know, he, he jumped up when he did the Matt Damon thing. He jumped up when he interviewed Obama. He jumped up when he, you know, so it always hair and you know, kind of dropped a few pounds and so it dies. Suit like he has a drive. There's no sense of complacency with Jimmy and I find that seems to be relatively concurrent with talk show hosts, Conan's like that. He's always reaching to know what I mean. He's never like, okay, we're done this the show. Let's just, let's just dial in reaching. I appreciate watching people reach. It's why I'm a huge fan of athletes in general, you know? I always feel like athletes are always trying for that next thing.

Speaker 4:          00:40:02       Yeah. It's, it's finding comfort and happiness in that struggle, enjoying the process that's very difficult for people and for some people that the monotony of showing up and doing it all over again that wears on them. It's really just about finding whatever the fuck it is for you. For some people it's not that for some people it's they kind of go to an Anthony Bourdain is an interesting cat and he had him on the show. Yeah, yeah, a while ago, but I've talked to him a gang of times that UFC is a huge UFC as a firearm while his wife trains. I don't think she's, she's competed in Jujitsu tournaments, but um, she's a mad man, mad woman rather. And he's doing it now as well. He's doing Jujitsu now, but the point being that he's a guy that doesn't feel like he, if he's home for a week or two, he's like, I gotta get the fuck out of here.

Speaker 4:          00:40:50       He's just constantly wants to go to Libya or Africa or China just want, he just wants to experience it at all. And his work is going to places and experiencing these completely different worlds. That's where it's where it's at for him. So He's, he got a totally, he's got a totally unique way of being ambitious. Very different than like a talk show host would show up and the same writers room and drink the coffee and bang up the jokes and he's just as ambitious. But his ambition is to go to Moscow to try their food and talk to their people.

Speaker 5:          00:41:24       Yeah. And he also, I don't know him at all, I think it's fantastic. I read kitchen confidential years ago when it first came out and I thought, wow, this guy's insane. And then obviously you blow up on TV.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       He also has a through line of an addict in his work. He was an ex addict. He holds his hands up and says that I think when you meet a lot of ex addicts or even addicts, they have that thing that they're doing which completely takes hold of their life, which is stopping them from doing the drug that they're addicted to and they can't. If they chill and relaxed then that, that Damon's going to come in and hang out with them. So I think baudins light, well if I spend 10 days at home, maybe that month is going to come out. So he has to keep me, you know, I don't know him well enough to know if that's true or not, but I know enough addicts that say I have to be on the new thing. I have to be moving to the new place.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       Your character was an addict, right? Did you have to do a lot of research about that? They didn't ask me to, but I mean I've had my own, you know, fun, positive, great Jenny with drugs in my life, you know, it's like that Gray Bill Hicks joke where he's like, I had a great time on drugs. Like, um, not, not to tell people to do drugs. I think it's a very, very personal thing. I was lucky enough to come from a family background that was very consistent and there, you know, my parents have been married for 42 years. I always came back to a household where dinner was on the table regardless with that eight or not, um, you know, a foundation of something that I think made me feel secure. Uh, got interested, was always interested in music, got interested in the Beatles when I was about 12, 13.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       I started reading up about them and read the rubber sole and sergeant peppers and the white album were very much influenced by drugs and thought, oh, that's interesting because I feel autistic and I'd like to see if I can make that artistic flower bloom a little bit. And at that point, me and three other bills, fans at my school site side started to seek out marijuana, which we ended up getting hold of. And he did that, a typical thing when your kids were, you know, you will smoke a joint in two and half minutes and everyone feels lightheaded and one of them puked and then you get nervous and paranoid and you run off and you think you're never going to do it again. And uh, and then you do it again. And then he'd do it again. And then at one point you're like, oh, it hit, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:43:53       And um, I. So I did that. I mean, fuck, I remember as I'm a very dedicated worker, I, you know, obviously I never do drugs when I'm working, but in my downtime on my weekends I might do that. And I flew my brother out to New Zealand to come check us all out making Lord of the rings. And at the time I was heavily into marijuana, probably the most. I was into it in my life and I would roll like 20 joints and put them in a cigarette box. I never smoked cigarettes, put them in a cigarette box that someone had given to me and I would just walk around the house, just smoking joints, like I'm smoking cigarettes and my brother who is only 16 months older than me, he sat me down at one point in that shape and he was like, I've never seen anyone smoke as much weed as you and how are you functioning and maybe you should consider not doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       And I was a highly functioning stone. I was like, fine, come on, let's go. And that's, you know, that's gone in different journeys in my life. So I think when I met Jj, I'd spent, I'd spent 18 months in la having not worked, exposing myself to La for the first time and not necessarily on the biggest part you've seen, but certainly on a bit of a party scene, hanging out with the wrong people, the wrong women. And I think Jay Jay's perceptive enough to probably see when I came into a meeting, like I was a bit rough around the edges. He didn't shave. He knows what it means to have a hangover. He's, you know, he knows what it means when we say certain buzzwords, so he could have danced in these arenas, you know? Um, so yeah, it's a cautionary tale. I think drugs and I'm really careful about it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       Like I, you know, I'm aware that there are young people who might follow me on twitter or follow me on instagram that, that would think, oh, well if he's done it, it's okay. And I don't, I don't subscribe to that. So I think you have to have your own journey and you have to have your own experiences. But the abuse of drugs has never been something that's been in my life. The usage of drugs has been something that I've done more often than not. If I'm partaking in some sort of drug, I have a notebook and a pen close enough by me. So if I feel like I'm inventing the future, I can write it down and then the morning when I wake up I can be like, oh, there's a positive element of that thing I took, you know, I'm like searching for stuff. And I think searching for stuff in that world can be quite significant.

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       Well, that's a very honest interpretation or very honest expression of what drugs are. Some drugs can be. And I think one of the problems with someone seeing you on social media or some young kid saying, well, if he takes him, I, I could take them there. Okay. And the only reason why they would have that thought at all is because they've been lied to so much. There's so much bullshit on TV. There's so much nancy grace and nonsense. And marijuana is more dangerous today than at anytime in the past. Still Marijuana. The end of the day. It's just pot. He has nobody's dying. Nothing happens. You get paranoid, you wake up, you're fine. No hangover. Your bones don't ache. You're really okay. No one died on an overdose of marijuana and history of the planet. You're saying that you will use to abuse it. It's like even your abuse. Look, you're functioning. You're not throwing up in your own bed. And No, you know, I've had, I've had,

Speaker 1:          00:47:18       uh, several moments in my life where I've said, okay, go flush that. Like you did it last night, you don't need to do it tonight. You don't need to do it tomorrow. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       It's Thursday night in moving into Friday night. You're not doing anything tonight. You know, that little monster is going to be in that drawer, flush it. But it's only been pot. No, no.

Speaker 3:          00:47:39       Been everything that's been everything. I was like, that's a weird one to taught, you know, because it doesn't usually taunt people. I mean, I find the friends that I have that I, I believe, you know, I would classify as addicted to marijuana. They, they do it because that's what they think they do. They get up and they do it because it's, it's almost like, it certainly can be an escape, but it's also a comfort and a lot of ways. It's like that thing that you do, like coffee. I have friends that can't get coffee, you know, they're like, fuck, I get up in the morning, I need that cup of coffee. It's like a ritualistic, comforting sort of a thing that they do.

Speaker 5:          00:48:15       I mean another way to describe it would be a crutch. Right? And that is a negative connotation. You don't necessarily want something in your life that as a crutch, whether that is marijuana or cocaine, or having to call your mom every day or needing to have the new Levi's, whatever that is. If it's a crutch, it's not good the best. If we're just talking about wheat, the best times for me on we'd have been ingesting it. I don't tend to smoke anymore. I put it in brownies. Ingesting it in a way that makes the next experience that I'm going to have much more colorful. Surfing on. Weed is a beautiful experience. You're in that flow, you're in that rhythm, you know, watching a movie that you really like. Listening to a new album. I mean dude, like I was still am in love with the band cigarettes, cigarettes, no Icelandic band that kind of referred to as the Icelandic radiohead.

Speaker 5:          00:49:00       S I s I g u a r o s separate word. Yeah. Cigarettes Way Sig you. Uh, and then a separate word r o s. So it's Sigur Ros, you a separate word. R O s, that first album has an alien fetus on the front cover. Standard Shit. Yeah, I'm an eighth. I'm an atheist and uh, I've always, you know, explored and struggled with the idea of God concepts. But I've always thought if there is a heaven that playing Sigur Ros is the most, is the most truly like captivate in bw. There you go. That's the album you want know. Wow. Okay. So cool. I'll listen to on the way home. So. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:49:48       I just love that I could do that. I can just order that shit up on my phone and listen to it on the way home or not. I don't even have to do it now and download it. I could sit in my car, look at it on the itunes, plugging into the dash and then it'll start playing. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:50:01       That's very cool to society that we live in. So wonderful. But I have an issue with the cloud. I don't like this clown

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       thing is a lot of weirdness is definitely out of weirdness in the whole idea of the cloud. You know that from happening, that happened and all these poor folks that had their porn up there got exposed. I think that's a, that's a tiny tremor that will lead to the ultimate earthquake that evades or a privacy rather.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       It killed. It killed the cloud in a lot of different ways. That happening thing. But also like not for the dudes who jerked off like wild monkeys. It was awesome. Yeah, that's true. At Jamie, Jamie's got fat, hard drive filled with fat burning content. But like if I really liked the film and I watch it, if it's streaming from watching it on Netflix, if I really found guaranteed I'm going to buy it, go buy it on DVD because I want the actual article wanting in my house. And the same with music. If I like an album, I'm going to go buy that CD and I don't want that medium to die, you know, I don't think it's going to die. Um, I was at the bookstore the other day with my mother in law and she was talking about a Zepplin how so the holy was there and they, they're selling these new vinyl versions of houses of the holy and like Barnes and noble in thousand oaks.

Speaker 2:          00:51:21       They filed these fucking, these albums and it's wild. Like these are 19 sixties, 19 seventies albums and people are buying records and turntables and they're getting into the actual physical medium again, opening it up and it's cool. Yeah, I mean I think the vinyl culture is really fantastic and that is great that the vinyl thing Kinda came back around again. I do think that those select artists that make their way onto vinyl, you, Jimi Hendrix is your, Elvis's you'd led Zeppelin's, you'd deals, they'll always be around, but the smaller ones they're going to be like, well, he's not big enough to go on vinyl, so let's just put them on digital. Someone's going to want him. We'll put him on digital in this. It makes me sad that there are albums that I own. If I break that CD, it's going to be very difficult for me to get it unless I pay $69 99 on Ebay in the night.

Speaker 2:          00:52:09       Get a copy of that's been previously used. Yeah, some comic Belper released a Carnegie Hall special that he did on the album as a vinyl thing where I think that's Kinda cool. So when I was a kid that was a big thing was listening to like cheech and Chong and bill cosby unfortunately arrested piece, still friendly recipes because they're the real bill cosby's dead. Sure. It's still funny though. It's still fun. Yeah. He was very funny. I mean that to me is one of the most fascinating. I, I say you could say scandals. Tragedies are horrific crimes, whatever it is, whatever you want to call it, but that, that guy turned out to be a rapist and a not just a, a just a rapist, but a guy who drug people and fuck them while they're unconscious. Like that guy was that right? That's still bends my brain, man. It's, it's a profound fall from grace. It's not just a fall from grace, it's just, it's horrific. It's, it's, it's, it's, it like twists the world. The world's not the same world anymore. Bill cosby's a rapist. Right, right, right. That's not the world's not the same anymore. I was the fucking. The huxtable dad. He was, he was this guy that was telling everybody to not swear. Right, right. He was the Jello pudding guy.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       Family Guy. He's the guy that you want to pick you up and sit on your knee and give you a life lesson. Now. You don't want him to sit on his knee when I was here or if you do, you fucking don't drink anything. You. When I was a kid, we used to listen to that album where he would talk about Noah and the Ark. Noah having that conversation with God where God was. No, uh, it's God, right? You know, like, it was a great bit, man. It was a great bit with no and not believing that God really wanted him to go out and build this ark. It's just, um, that was, that was how we listened to comedy. We would all sit around and we'd put the headphones on and we would all sit around and listen to this, you know, whether it's cheech and Chong or we got a hold of some oral old George Carlin Jack.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       Then so dangerous, so edgy, so brave guy and wasn't in the beginning, you know. And then there's an interesting lesson if you go see George Carlin's, the early, early, early stuff, it was like straight up tonight. Show TV friendly comedy. Yeah. And somewhere along the line he just cut, kinda twisted. Well, I never knew him, never met him. I get the feeling that he got angry about something and stop giving a shit. And that's what his real voice came from him. He was just like, fuck this man. I'm not going to get famous. I'm looking at my own late night talk show. Let's do it. He's, I don't know if that's what his goal was or who knows, whatever it was like Bill Hicks was living like that, right? I mean, he was great. His material was fantastic, but there was a point where he was like, fuck this.

Speaker 4:          00:54:53       Like I see the fucking rip in the universe, I see it and now I'm going to pull it out to all you guys. He didn't have a chance unfortunately. I met. I met him a couple of high like, but never like hung out and talked to him. Same with Carla and I met him like I had the store passing by. He was very friendly. Hello? Hello. Hello. Carla is so epic. I got to see Hicks live when I was an open mic or which was a great, great, great chance to see like one of the all time greats is a beginning. A beginning of my career. I got to see him bomb. Oh well I got see bomb and not give a fuck was me and Greg Fitzsimmons and a few other comics in the back of the room. There was maybe 200 5,300 people in the room when he started.

Speaker 4:          00:55:34       By the time he was done there was 50 and we were all screaming in the mood. Um, he was bombing, you know, it'd been, wasn't going, but the comics were laughing hard. We were laughing hard and a few people were laughing hard, right. And then there's a few people in the audience that was trying to figure out what everybody was laughing at that stuck around and try to save like, am I missing out on something cool here? Like, yes you are. Yeah, it was, it was. He went on after a guy who was like really hacky. The guy went on before was like, he was doing impressions of cartoon characters if they smoke marijuana, you know, it was a real standard, like I mean like straight across the board, like cop donut jokes and that kind of flown on an airplane and they, the audience was fairly dimwitted and they were enjoying this really stupid comedy and then Hicks came out and just did all this really radical, crazy shit

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       that just, they just weren't hearing it and they just got up and sometimes it's difficult to be in the presence of genius. Right? I mean it tends to be standup. I think of his genius is absolutely phenomenal. Rolling Stone interview with a John Lennon with the guy who invented rollingstone yen went to. It's like, well, he had the edited versions about 40 minutes, I've got about three hours of it and landon gets angry about the fact that he's a genius and he's having to perform like a clown in front of these fucking retards that don't get it, and he resents like, I resent the fact that they're not receiving it and they're also telling me that Maya is x, y, and zed. You don't get to fucking tell me what my art is. I'm the iced. You just sit there and fucking listen to it. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       I appreciate that. You're never going to get it. You know, I think the Hicks thing, what was going on was that he hadn't found those people yet. This was all pre internet, so no one had. No one knew what he was doing, so they were going to go see a guy who was a funny comedian and they had seen him on the Rodney dangerfield comic special on Hbo and he only did like seven minutes on that or whatever the hell it was. Whatever they do. It was a very small, short, funny set, but it was funny, a bunch of jokes and so people went to see him a lot based on that and they went to see him. They're like, what the fuck is all this anger? Dude, he hadn't really found that audience yet. Right. And then he died huge biggest standup comedian in England for probably four years earlier when he wouldn't a ward, which is at the Edinburgh fringe festival.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       And he was huge. He was, by the time he died, he was the Jim Morrison of standup comedy for us. Well, he did relentless. He filmed it live in England, you know, and you wrote a very risky thing to do. It wasn't his best special. He was very tight and one of the reasons is because it was all one take was one show, one take and you know, it's an hbo special, so it's a. But again, he was a guy that if he found his audience, if they knew where to go, you know, like today, if he was alive today, my God, who would have been so fucking monster following be the king, the king or one of the Kings, you know what I mean? So it's just a finding. Then we'd find out that he's drugging jerks. Yeah. Yeah. No, probably not. But I mean, I love what Louis Ck is doing right now.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       I mean, he, he's an exceptional right age. Very. He's very artistic. He's very, he's very. I'm on the edge. You know what I mean? He comes up with the joke and then he retires it and that's it. You know what I mean? He's coming up with new stuff, I think. I think he's fantastic. And the fact that he edits and writes and directs and producing stars in his show, brilliant. He's obviously a phenomenal. I'm, I'm okay with darkness and I know what the darkness is for me. There is. There are moments when I'm watching a show or I'm like, oh, just two. Oh, his TV show. Yeah. So it's two dogs. Yeah. The TV show, I'm not a big fan of like depressing shit. I'm not. I don't

Speaker 4:          00:59:21       want to watch. So you've got kinda. Yeah, like he's getting frustrated is fixing his kid's doll and I was like, oh no, no, no. The overlying themes of like, you'll. This is never going to get any bad. You're fucked. You're never going to find someone who loves you again. I don't buy another bad father. It's duct heavy. Yeah. But he, he minds that you know and comes up with great, hilarious shit from that. It's just, it's one of those things like everybody's got their own little fucking thing. Have you ever seen Joey Diaz? No, but I heard him on your show. Yeah, he's funny as hell. You got to see that guy. Like what's his vibe standup wise? He's a monster. He's the funniest guy that's ever lived. I heard you say that on the show. Like never seen anybody funnier. I've never seen anybody who kills so hard.

Speaker 4:          01:00:06       So what's his. I mean he was an animal. He said it's $300 story. He's got great jokes, great stories. He's just, he's just a wild fucker. Who's been through everything? He's been to jail for. Armed kidnapping was a cocaine addict for most of his life. He's just a fucking bonafide gangster. Do you think that he was friendly? He doesn't mean it doesn't give any fucks. He has zero fucks in his tank. I mean for real. Like, look, there's a lot of people tell you they don't give a fuck, but they do. He really doesn't give a fuck. You know what I mean? Who gives a fuck about his friends and his family and you know what he's doing. But he's free now cause he's got his own podcast. He sells out everywhere he goes doing stand up and he doesn't give a fuck. He doesn't want to do anything other than that because that's just what he does.

Speaker 4:          01:00:49       But before he goes, before he leaves this earth, you've got to see him. You have to show la all the time. I'll let you know. I'll, I'll find out what it's going to be around you. GotTa. Come see him. I love standup. I mean, you know, I love, I just love that medium. I think it's really, it's super brave and I think a lot of people don't necessarily know the mechanics of hail. A comedian found himself being onstage with a microphone and if anyone did know that people will shut the fuck up and laugh or just politely leave because like the disrespect shown by hecklers to standup Comedians, were you like, do you have any idea how ballsy is to get up on stage and show your ass like that all the time, but you know what that is, man. That's just. It's the same thing.

Speaker 4:          01:01:35       It's like people that are haters on twitter or facebook, it's just too easy to do so. It's too easy to speak up. It's too easy to take. It's too easy to just have an opinion that's not nuanced and not objective. It's to easy shit. Yeah, exactly. It's so easy to do that. It's so easy to be that dummy, you know? I mean, there was that guy the other day at the comedy store where there those fucking guys were drunk in the back of the parking lot and give everybody a hard time. There's just so many of them and they're just dim witted dumb people that they shouldn't have that ability to speak to you, but they do. So they are just, they are not smart. They're not sensitive. They're not thinking, but they look forward. How do you deal with hecklers? I mean like your little imposing.

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       So I would imagine people heckle you had called you a little less cold. Got To all the time. Everybody gets tackled. People get drunk. They're not thinking straight. They're not thinking like maybe this guy could kill me, maybe I should shut the fuck up. So I don't think like that. Do you call them out? Do you have fun? Them? Depends. It's like there's no, like, some heckling is funny, you know, like there was like sometime one time I was on stage in New York and uh, and I said, do you know what the most famous woman in the world is? It was a bit about Kim Kardashian meeting the aliens and they're like, if aliens came down and they met Kim Kardashian and they had to, they had to explain like Kim Kardashians existence in her fame. Like why is this girl famous? If anybody had to explain it with the how the islands would fail, and I said, do you think about who's the most famous woman in the world?

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       And some guy goes, your mom and I just started laughing because it was fun. It was in that moment. It was a ridiculous, smart ass funny thing to say and it wasn't a guy who was heckling. The whole show was just like, he said that one thing and then I started laughing and everybody else was laughing. I'm like, we'll just let that slide. That was very funny. Sometimes it's funny, you get to be. No, I don't encourage it. You shouldn't do it, but occasionally it works and that's not a mean spirited thing. No, it's like sometimes people, they just want to be a part of it. They want to get a little drunk, they want to say something and it's all different and then sometimes you just get more on. So sometimes you could just get people that just really don't. They don't deserve to be there, they just, they can't handle the experience.

Speaker 4:          01:03:47       I've seen that as an audience member, I've seen that where people are yelling out and you just want to grab them and drag them out of there. Like that guy on stage. You just, you should not be talking to your fucking it up for the other 300, 99 people in this fucking room. Right. You're so egocentric that you're concentrating on yourself and your own what you like and don't like. They had a couple too many drinks at the restaurant. They got talked into coming to the comedy club. They didn't. They don't know what it is and they're like, shit, dark room, but I'm supposed to show up. I was in the middle of token. It didn't. I'm going to keep talking this that there's alcohol which really fucks with judgment and this also. A lot of people have this really bizarre and titled Thing where they're entitled to their opinions and they feel like this is something that they're allowed to.

Speaker 4:          01:04:29       You know, they're allowed to voice their disapproval about and you should stop. I had to give a woman yell out next subject wants to me, which is hilarious. No, I'm holding the microphone where there was this bit I was doing for awhile about a, there was a thing called the second coming project was before, um, genetics, when, when, when they first starting mapping out the human genome, there's just people that wanted to get, they wanted to get DNA from the shroud of Turin and they wanted to try to clone Jesus and he thought that if they cloned Jesus would bring him back and that, that would be how Jesus Return. And uh, so my, my take on it was like, what have they brought Jesus back and he was retarded. Like what if it goes you, Connie doesn't work, like you have to do it a lot of times in order to find an effective clung.

Speaker 4:          01:05:15       So the first one that you do, like, what if it comes out wacky, like would have, he has down syndrome. Do you, do you kill him? And she's like next subject, next. And she was sitting in the front row looking at like, is it, that's it. Like you're just going to say that and that just ends. No. Now you're this objects. You don't know. I'm of magical fictional Jewish Zombie. Can't come back retarded. Is that what you're saying? Fuck off. She's in the God squad she couldn't handle it allows people in the God squad cut in and all that stuff, so it might not even be the God squad. It might just be in her very narrow view of the world down syndrome. Is that unacceptable subject or religious? Anything religion. Like I've had people say, well, hey man, as long as you don't talk about politics or religion, like, well that's ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       Those are two things you should absolutely fucking talk about it every chance you get because the one of the reasons why both of those dumb, retarded fucking things are still around and the same state they've always been around is because dummies like you don't talk about it because you've locked it in this ideology box and tucked it away somewhere where you just talk about the Lakers and the fucking lawn and how long you think this drought's going to last. You don't want to talk about the fact that you're getting fucked and then you're being surrounded by children who believe in magic. Yeah. Surface stuff, I mean people are, people are a little scared about that. I mean, I feel like in comedy, nothing's off the table. Nothing's off the table. It's only, might not be right. It might not be funny, but even like patrice o'neal, the late great patrice o'neil had a really good point once where he was like, if someone goes on stage and offends you, they say something to offend you.

Speaker 4:          01:06:46       Or if someone goes on stage and and makes you laugh. Both of those things come from the same place. They're both trying to make you laugh, but it doesn't always work. You know, like the ideas that eventually become great bits. There's been nights I had, I had some bits that they eventually became like closing bits, like bits that I had to close on because I couldn't follow them. They were just too good for me. They were like, all my other bits weren't as strong as them, but at one point in time they would bomb and that like when they were first developing almost like, how the fuck am I going to get this to work? It's just too weird. It's too fucked up. It's too controversial. It's too. It doesn't. It's not connecting with people. Whatever the reason was and almost every bit sort of starts out in an embryonic stage.

Speaker 4:          01:07:33       What it eventually becomes when it's a finished product and if that is an. If it's a bit that's controversial and it starts out in its embryonic stage, you're like, nick, sap jacked stop dog. Like you're missing the whole entire point of stand up and you can't be here because you're a part. As an audience member, every audience member is not just there. You're not just seeing a show. When you stand up, you're in part of the creative process because the bits come alive in front of the crowd. They evolve and change in front of the crowd and that's how they become something that eventually gets on television becomes a special until that, until it happens, you're in as much as the comic is, you're, you're in on it. We need you. I give it. If it for the audience,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       no jokes would ever come out, right. They just. You wouldn't really exactly know the best way to do any of them. You have to do them in front of people.

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       Yeah. How do you feel that Seinfeld, Jerry Seinfeld's up.

Speaker 3:          01:08:28       He's a very funny standup. I mean he's a very good comic. He's not, he's not my kind of stand up, you know? I prefer standups. We don't have any restrictions. I don't like standups that only. You don't use any swear words and don't talk about sex. They don't talk about anything profound. Everything is like real simple. Straight across like losing socks in the dryer type shit. I think he's a brilliant. It just not how I prefer like a bill burr or a Louis ck or jody is like, that's my. Because I go see Joey Diaz. I'd see it. There's nothing that's off the table. I'm seeing chaos, you know? And at the end of this show you're fucking holding your body laughing and you're like, I can't believe he doing. He does his bit about eating and girls eating the girl's pussy from behind a sticking your nose in her ass.

Speaker 3:          01:09:16       Like a pigeon. Like who? Like you got to do the pigeon and he does this. Like I'm not doing it any justice. I'm totally fucking up though. You're like, that's not even funny. This is the funniest guy ever. Got to see it, but you need his body and with his voice, everything and it has to do with, you know, what was set up before that and where we're got to. He has this bit about the fucking Liberace Hbo movie with Matt Damon and I'm Kirk Douglas. Michael Douglas is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen in my life to a point where I'm holding my body to keep everything from breaking from laughing too hard.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       I like so. I mean, I like old strains of standup. The thing I totally hear you in terms of the limitations that that Seinfeld gives himself. There's no profanity. A doesn't necessarily tell you a huge amount about himself. It's kind of abstract stuff. I love words. I'm a huge fan of words. I love etymology. I like studying woods, the origin of words, all that kind of stuff. He is a fantastic wordsmith and also he's very, very specific. Like he will, he will omit the wood, the if he doesn't need it because he examines the entire sentence. I love the dedication to that. I also love the free form element of, you know, what he was doing, just anger coming at you or Eddie Izzard is very kind of like just school of thought went all over the place. The thing that I love about Seinfeld might be the limitations that he gives himself, but also that idea of the choices that I'm making. I've made specifically for this joke to work as correctly as I think. And he's a, he's a professor of comedy, right? I mean, he knows comedy, knows the history of comedy. Who knows what's funny. He knows what's not funny and uh, there is something very safe about him and I could bring my parents to see him and he is old school. But for me, the fact that Seinfeld lives in this world of Joey Diaz is and

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       bill burrs and Louis ck makes him almost like the last of a dying breed, you know, and I do have a lot of respect. Well, gap again is very clean, although he's not the kind of wordsmith that does. Seinfeld is A. Brian Regan is also very clean and very, very funny, you know, but I hear you. I mean he's a master at economy of words, that's for sure. He, there's, there's definitely a rhythm to learning, like when you know, when to leave words in, when to add more words, when to have a pause, when to have no pause and there's an art to that sort of creation of the bits. He's definitely a master at that moment as well. She, she knows woods too short. It's very specific words and you know, she can be a little, a little frisky it a little noisy, but obviously that's very disarming when you know you're kind of an attractive lady to get up and do that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:12:06       I think she's. I think she's brilliant and unfortunately it is a very male as a society is a very male dominated job in the sense that I feel like if Sarah was a guy, there's a chance she could be a little bigger than most. She is nailed. Some would argue the opposite. Some would argue that female comics are judged on a curve and that the best comics, if you look at like the best female comics that are alive today and compare them just bit for bit for the best male comics, you wouldn't really have them in the same category. You think she can throw down with Louis Ck? I feel like Sarah Sarah was brilliant. She. Well, I mean I, it's weird like I don't like seeing, you know, even though I said Joey Diaz is the best in the world because I think he just makes me laugh the hardest because that's like my style of comedy.

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       I love that crazy chaotic style, but I don't take he out of the equation. I don't think there's a best. But I've seen Sarah. Sarah was at the store two weeks ago and she was fucking fantastic. Just smashing, just fantastic. But I've seen, I've seen birds without. Do you know Duncan Trussell? Yep. Duncan drops. Even Duncan trussell just stand up and doug stanhope destroyed. It's all about, you know, if they're in their groove, if there, you know, and there were always recycling material so you catch them two years from now, it's going to be a totally different set, a totally different point of view, totally different place in their life. Totally different perspective. And I think, you know, as far as personal taste, it kind of ebbs and flows depending on where that person is at any point in their life. Yeah. Yeah. I saw doug stanhope well and so the, the cody stood, I was fucking bent over. Double laughing so hard. I him and then there's a guy I've only seen once. I didn't even know if he's on the silk anymore. He's called Dove Davidoff. Yeah, definitely. With office around still. That guy killed me one night and he's, he's just cool as fuck man. Fucked up leather jacket, shaved his head, look Kinda like a little bit of a g and his material was just excellent. You know, it's light status on any given night, you know, I think also coming from England and having, excuse me, having that backdrop of Monte python and Derek

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       and clive and stuff, the playfulness of words is something that I appreciate. Like do you know money pythen came out with a vinyl record as a double groove in it for the stones. So you put on, let's say side B, but it hits on the second groove, so you hit the exact same record, but then the last sketch is different. So then you're like, fuck, I love that sketch. Not heard that before. I must have been too stoned or too fucked up. You put it on again, but it doesn't hit the second group. It hits the first group. So you get to the end of the record, the sketch has gone. You're like, wait a minute, if I smoke then you put it on again, but it's back. And monty python put that in for the 19 sixties audience. They're listening like that Shit I love, you know, love that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       Yeah. Monty Python, they were definitely groundbreaking. Insane, insane. They did some pretty, pretty incredible shit. Yeah. And it's still, a lot of it still holds up, you know. Totally. I mean, you know, everyone talks about the parrot sketch periscope just fine. But for me, like the argument sketches, one of my favorites, there's one called travel agent, which is insane. There's, you know, the fish dance, you know, the fish tanks. No to people. I think it's definitely Michael Pailin. Could be Graham Chapman stood on the end of a pretty high canal. One guy has one guy has two little fish, like kinda big sardines are about that big. And he skips over to the, uh, skips over to Michael Pailin, slaps me in the face a couple times, skips back, skips over to Michael Baden and slaps me in the face a couple times with these fish. It's skips back and then the other guy and then he finished and he stands stale near the guy, pulls out a fucking huge trout and just takes them out and throws him in the canal.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       It's like completely silenced. Done to music. I've seen that. I've seen so a Naca can stupid, you know. How long have you been living in America? Uh, I moved to La in 2003, so a while, uh, first moved to the back of my managers, God. And she had like a granny flat, not were there any more. So there was no toilet in, there was no TV, there was no toilet, no toilets. Where did you go to the toilet? So what she would do. So she worked over at her house, which was also her office. She would leave the back door open, but she would lock the bathroom from the inside. So at nighttime I could go open the back door, go use the bathroom, but I couldn't enter the house because it'd been locked from the inside. Uh, I had no phone and no. Oh, so the first 18 months in La was just a fucking joke to we just trapped.

Speaker 1:          01:16:49       Yeah. And she would come and knock on my door and go, hey, I have an audition at 1115 and it'd be like 10. And I go, okay, someone gave me a ride to go, no. I go, okay, we're going to have to cancel that because I don't have a car and I couldn't get to Santa Monica. And that went on for awhile and then eventually she was like, maybe buy a car and I get a phone. I was like, yeah, okay, I'll do that. And then it started to kind of shift around a little bit. So when you came over, you were just known as an actor? Yeah, I had done a couple of TV shows in England, a little bit of theater in England, started to do some English films and was doing a TV show in France for England. When I got the role on load the rings when it did load the rings.

Speaker 1:          01:17:33       Uh, and as we're coming towards the end of principal photography, which is almost two years, the onset publicist is medical Claire Raskin think she's married now, so she has a different name. She said to me, what you gonna do after this we're going to do when we wrap in December. It was like, oh no, go back to Manchester, wait for it to come out a year later. And she said if I was you, I'd go to La, get jumped on this. Like go take some means, get a manager, get an agent like, okay, cool. Good advice. Went back to Manchester for low, but Manchester had amazing. Say Manchester's, you know, if la is London, Manchester is New York, it's industrial. It's a bit rough or been. Most Times people say, oh, I can throw big football town foreign place to do stand up. Yeah. That rockers. And they drink and they like to fight you a lot of fights.

Speaker 1:          01:18:25       I saw a lot of fights there. I'm got to have your shit together, you know. So. So went back to Manchester was bored. I mean Manchester has a lot of great elements to it. There's not a huge amount of work for an act today. You can do some soap opera is like coronation street or something. Shit. What's coronations true? Incarnates street is the longest running soap opera in England. I think it's been running for four years. Oh yeah. Uh, is there any original cast members? Is a guy called Bill Roche who was in the first ever episode and he's been in it for edges. It's called Barlow in the show and it's a very boring, very pedestrian, a slice of northern life and the way that you, the way that they combat that in England is to have a show called east enders, which is about London life and eastenders is like drugs and crack confide in markets and you know, everyone gets their hands dirty and yeah, like snatch serialized snatch and then carnation street is about, you know, obviously we brought Ge have lost me, brought you or what's a budget, like a budgerigar, like a canary or you know, the casket, open tray and can't get a cat down.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       And then they call the fire brigade and the fire brigade turned up. I'm one of the people who's in the fire brigade, happens to be the ex lover of the person who's got the cat and they get together and they go have a pint together and it's very just like a low hum. Very northern, but it's a little, I think derogatory towards London people because it paints them to be two dimensional, you know, they all were flat caps and all of football. Me and bit simple and you know, I don't really know. I'm talking about all of that. Newspaper was a bit scary or what news, you know, so I was always a little offended by a carnation street. Uh, but that was the option when you, Manchester, if you're an actor,

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       be incarnations to you. It wasn't really my vibe. So I came to La and uh, was still am really good friends with larger would so hung out with logic for probably a month or so just hanging out and go to Disneyland and Magic Mountain and do nothing. Mann's Chinese theater. Huge deal for me. Huge. Like when I was growing up the whole put your hands in the Clark Gable hand thing or see how small bay gribbles feet where the, that's a huge deal for me. That's old school Hollywood. So I did all that and then moved to my manager's place, uh, and you know, just kind of fucked up for a year and then got my shit together and start going to the gym and started feeling a bit better about stuff and had a couple of auditions that I got clothes on and then ended up getting an audition for last and then, you know, kind of that's all she wrote.

Speaker 5:          01:20:54       Yeah, I think you kind of have to think about the, the, the enormity of rings was like, it was such a big job to do and coming down the other side of it, you have to have a little bit of time to kind of take a breath. And I think that was different for a love of the people. You know, Vigo went off and rode horses for a year and you know, Orlando stayed working very quickly and billy got enrolled. The rode horses, like no acting, just rode horses. I think for the light. The first year after law, the rings, he was very much into just being on his own riding horses. He's like one of those Daniel Day Lewis characters isn't a totally. He was so good in the fucking the apocalypse movie. What does that movie, the road? The road. I couldn't even watch it. Oh, I got to the point where he's teaching his son how to shoot himself in the mouth.

Speaker 5:          01:21:38       I was like that. We're good. Yeah. It's active and have you seen and promises, but he plays the Russian guy with 10:11. Fantastic. Has the naked fight in the steam room. He's ballsy. He's a very ballsy act and he's a great guy. Did you guys live in New Zealand when you were doing that? Yeah, two years. For two years. Just under two years. What does that, what is that like New Zealand? I, you know, I was dumb enough to assume that New Zealand would have the weather the Australia has because it's close to it on the map, but it's actually not close to a geographically. It's a long way away and certainly much more southern geographically then Australia, so he kind of has an English weather sunny days, but generally, you know, showers and when they call it Windy Wellington, because, you know, every year some old woman will get blown down on the street and you know, it'd be a huge issue there.

Speaker 5:          01:22:18       It's a very safe country in terms of going out and doing your thing. They have a great respect for our, you know, everyone's, everyone's inked, everyone's called. It ain't. I've never seen so many tattoos on young people in my life, which they go over that more of a tribal thing, but certainly it's a rite of passage. When you reach 18 or 20 or 21, you'll get a tattoo. They love our. Everyone's, everyone's a sculptor. Big Surfing community goes acute. Um, they like to drink like English people, which didn't necessarily do me any favors. We had countryside is so beautiful. Beautiful. That's why they filmed it there, right? Yeah. PDX also also Kiwi. So he's from, he's from there. So he wants to keep all of his movies on the island of New Zealand. On the islands of New Zealand, because it brings a lot industry in the. I don't think he would've done it if he knew it was outside of his wheel house, but you can. There's nowhere else to make the Lord of the rings. Fucking sceneries so spectacular. The shy exists. You can go to the shy green rolling hills sheep everywhere. Cows. Beautiful.

Speaker 4:          01:23:20       Yeah. It's a strange place New Zealand because it's covered with all these animals to. There's so many wild animals that were brought in there. Like apparently there was no mammals. They're like in the 16 hundreds or whatever the fuck it was when people started arriving.

Speaker 5:          01:23:32       Yeah. And they have a huge issue with that. They have a huge issue with, uh, you know, animals being brought into the very strict and customs also, you know, millions of years ago you had birds flying over New Zealand going, wow, that place looks rad. Locust trees everywhere and there's no humans. I'm going to land. Which they did. And then over the course of a few more million years and they then lost the ability to fly because they didn't need it because no natural predators to hold these flightless birds walking around doing their thing. Then they accidentally bring in things like possums and rats and stuff and cats and these animals can't believe their luck. But like there's all these flightless bird, the carbon climate tree and one of these birds Kakapo's Kias, Kiwis, there'll flightless they'll. I mean the Kakapo is a parrot, one of the largest parents in the world.

Speaker 5:          01:24:13       The mail. We'll build a little depression in a u shaped valley. So he'll build 11 amplify, which will be a u shape valley in that valley. He'll build a depression and he'll sit in that depression and make a deep, guttural base like noise for his female to hear him and the female will walk over. But it takes place over the course of a few days and any animal can hear that. So the rats and the caps and the possums would just follow the sound and the male won't move. It'll just sit there and they just kill them. They just kill them and eat, so then now being present now being protected in certain parts of New Zealand because these polar animals have been fucked over by with one

Speaker 4:          01:24:52       Australia's had similar issues and one of the things that Australians had an issue with was the proliferation of rabbits. Rabbits had gotten to Australia and they just bread like a motherfucker and spread across the entire country and along the way they had to figure out how to mitigate the issue of these rabbits and the overpopulation. So they brought in foxes and then the Fox has got out of control and then they brought in feral cats. Feral cats and foxes are like one of the biggest issues in all of Australia. They just have an overwhelming amount of them and they still haven't put a dent in the rabbit population. No, no.

Speaker 5:          01:25:28       I mean anytime human beings try and get involved with the nature of things, they make a huge mess of it. I mean there's A. There's a classic story in Hawaii where I can't remember what the animal was. I used to know, but they brill in an animal to bring down the populations of another animal, but the animal is Diane. All the other animals nocturnal. So they never meet each other. They just smell each other. Like I know he's a rat. Is Subway is borrow, you know. So that's hilarious. It's scary. I mean, you know, I think humans, well, I don't think humans are easily my least favorite animal on the planet.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       I don't have a huge amount of hope for them as a species. I'm pretty ashamed to retailers and Oh kimmy would dong dude. But you're nice. I'm nice when we're talking about the individual that's tangential, I mean as a species, but you know, we, we, uh, a mess and we're breeding out of control and for some reason we, we place a huge amount of importance on human life because our brains are developed to the point where we think that we're special. But if you were to take humans off this planet and have a look at it in 200 years, it would be a vibrantly green blue planet living in balance with itself. If you had to take right, but you wouldn't want to live there. Well yeah. He wouldn't be able to tell anybody. That'd be no restaurants and they know movies. Whatever. Get Mad.

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       You would have never worked. Never worked, but I know computers. I would live in the plains live, get you get it and you'd eaten within an hour they'd find you and they'd fucking cut you down, but you still live in. But you live in balance with that, with that will, you know if you'd state worms or an all spiders, old Beatles off the planet, we would be dead in a hundred years. You know, I'm lucky enough to do this show and every so often we find ourselves in the real wilderness way. You've taken a car to a river and a river to a boat and then walk to someone else and then taking another boat for three hours down river and you're heading to this forest jungle light location and I'll see humans on the river's edge fishing or playing kids, little six, seven, eight year old kids. And I think those fuckers know so much that we'll never know.

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       They know when the rains come in, they know when the Predator is nearby. They have incredible night vision. They have hearing that we can only imagine they have the ability to climb a tree, like we can't all heal themselves with a fruit or with a plan. And I, I admire that much more than whoever the whatever the fuck Kanye does. Anyone like not just county. I'm not picking on county, but like I know the bronze. Incredible. He's an incredible athlete. I have a lot of respect for him and Steph curry isn't an amazing basketball player. They can't contend with the ability that these children have these light indigo child. Right. But much like your agent told you back in the day, they lived different lives. You can't compare Lebron to them and if you put coby Brian on that island making some snap, easy put coby Brian on that island, he would probably starve to death.

Speaker 1:          01:28:27       He put them on the court with them. They wouldn't score a single point. Oh yes. It's like we're. We're all in these different paths. Yes. Hosts for courses, but my, my retort to that would be, you know, the the correct way to live on this planet would be the way that they're doing it and all the way coby is doing it. Who knows how coby lives his life. He is an extraordinary athlete, but in terms of excess and unpolished, in terms of the excess of, let's say Los Angeles, the waste, the portion size, the pollution, the traffic, we're not getting it right. We've, we've got it wrong. We don't seem inclined necessarily to it

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       in the western world because we're like, well, yeah, but we can all eat. We live in warm houses. We get DIRECTV. Like I'm just chilling. Like intuit really hits the fan and the tsunami comes in. We're good. The other people, those Africans, they've kind of fucked it up and the people in Southeast Asia, they fucked it up in South America is a mess. But in la you like, same way we did it. We succeeded or not succeeded, but not living in balance with our planet. We are killing our planet. It is on its way and it might not happen in our lifetime and I know certain people have said this for generations. You have all these scientists saying it might not happen in my lifetime, but it was certainly happened in the next and I'm part of that was that those people representing that comment as well, but I do believe that we're at that tipping point of like, what are we?

Speaker 5:          01:29:45       What are we doing? Why are we here? We're not here to make cash. We can't be because I mean it's. It's about moving from being a human species that made some mistakes and realize the limitations of our planet to living as a human species that has the potential to go forward into our future. At the moment, there is no future for human beings. It's a. it's a ticking clock. We need to take that clock out of the scenario to be a successful species because Andy did it. These did it, wounds did it, and which are my favorite animal by the way, live in extremely condensed societies. There's no murder, there's no rape. They look after their kids. They made their forest healthier. They leave no carbon footprint. They make the planet bear. I can't talk.

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       They don't make movies. Music is bullshit. They may make me have a conversation with them. You want to beat your head up against a rock. If you wanted to fuck one, you'd be something wrong with you. People are way better than ads. I think that what we're doing is definitely tragic. If you look at the consequences that human society has on the environment itself, but if you look at the potential that human minds and human creativity and ingenuity half and you look at what we've been able to accomplish with raw materials and what we've been able to build in this incredible world. Just the ability to do this kind of a show where you're broadcasting something right now, it's flying through the air into people's phones because people in their car that are listening to this in real time. I just think that what we need to do is put some of that ingenuity on figuring out how to be more renewable and figure out how to way to be more sustainable, but I don't think that's outside of the realm of possibility by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       I just think it's hard because people live in the moment and they don't feel the consequences of their actions until they're too late and I think that's an issue that people have to recognize the consequences globally of the human race and what this, this thirst for innovation and expansion and overpopulation, what what is the impact on it. But there's been a lot of talk and a lot of a lot of thought and a lot of planning and preparing for an eventual world where we don't have waste. I think just even the concept of waste is just about not

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       thinking things all the way through and that a lot of what is waste is really just an alternate source of energy that needs to figure out how to be used or we need to figure out how to use it. But I'm a huge fan of people. They're my favorite animal. Unless you at least favorite animal on the planet, you're allowed to have your opinion and then you have seen people totally entitled to that. People are all my favorite people. Yes. Uh, you know, there are some very, very smart minds out there and obviously the most impressive thing would you rather hang out with them or a panda I would rather go with can really the hottest chick in the world who's super smart. Would you rather hang out with her? A squirrel. I mean, I've hung out with hot chicks before. I feel like I've got. You've got it down, but you don't know the squirrel and you only need to get to know that I've got feed him and nut and figure out what is it? Do you shit. You eat nuts. What else do you ponder the universe? Do you realize they were alone and infinity? There is a mystery about those animals that I don't, I don't

Speaker 5:          01:32:55       field of mystery as much with human beings. Yeah. And, and, and you know, there are, there have been some incredibly profound leaps in technology with some very, very smart people on this planet and we are doing the best that we can do. I would argue that all of those technological breakthroughs and all of those concepts that we have and all of those ways that we can talk about being impressive as a species because we cannot avoid. It comes from a very human angle. We're looking at it in a human conundrum because we're in our brain was saying, well that's fine. You know, humans can be Dicks, but think about what we've done. We went to the fucking moon and you know, we know what the dark side of Mars looks like and we put robots on Mars and we can create music that was made in an orchestra based on scratches in a record group like that. That shit is insane. It doesn't matter. None of that stuff match. It's not why we're here and it doesn't, it doesn't do anything for the larger concept of this universe and this planet. It does something for us as a species. Selfishly, we're amazing what we did. We created this thing and you know we went to the moon ends. Don't care that you went to the moon.

Speaker 3:          01:34:04       Well, the universe doesn't care of ants exist. I mean, if the universe doesn't have any feeling for this planet, this planet will disappear. This, this star will eventually run out of gas and burn out and Supernova and all the planets in orbit will be unsustainable for any kind of life that we understand and the universe won't give a fuck. You know why? Because it's infinite and somewhere out there there's a billion fucking earths in a billion solar systems that are absolutely exactly the same as ours and it doesn't care, so it doesn't matter whether you're an aunt or a person, but to say that it doesn't matter that there's someone put those grooves after spending all this time talking about how great monty Python r that's, but it's not just for you. It's for all the people that experienced that and the what. What humans can do that these animals can't do is spread these experiences as art.

Speaker 3:          01:34:52       Whether it's Louis Ck standup or Sarah Silvermans, standup or Monty Python's jokes or Janis music, what he can't say that that's nothing because what that has done is elevate the emotions of every single human being that's experienced that and you could say that human beings aren't important, but then in that case and nothing is important, life is not important. The ocean is not important. Not really in a greater spectrum of the universe. This infinite thing that we exist in, none of that is statistically important, but to us for an entity that is experiences that you're way more important to me than a squirrel. I'll just tell you right now, way more than aunt. If I had an anime and if I crushed that aunt, if I could get a giggle out of you at smash that animal, you weren't getting gigs.

Speaker 5:          01:35:38       Cry For the would cry for an aunt. Well, I wouldn't necessarily cry, but if you had an end on you and you were like, I'm going to crush this. How do you feel about it? I would go into, go into a long chicken. You were eating chicken. He. I was eating chicken. I mean, it happens, you know, it doesn't happen. I go out, it doesn't happen. I killed them. That's true. I go out my way to try and live in balance and be nice to the university as best as I can because it makes me feel bad. It makes me feel that my life is in more balance. If I, if I do that, you know, I'm actually working in flow with the universe and I agree. I don't necessarily think that the universe has a bias one way or the other. If we were to play around with the idea of the universe sitting down with a pad and a piece of paper and they drew a line in it and they went in on one side, humans on the other side and they.

Speaker 5:          01:36:29       They weighed up the pros and cons and it's with every time they win, every time. Joe, what do you mean by the pros and cons to that too? You know, the universe is having a conversation with Jimmy Hendrix and Jimmy Hendrix says, okay, you tell me, which is the most impressive animal to you. If you were to compare humans with ants, I believe that the universe of say there's no contest. These animals live in complete balance with the planet and they do all the right things. They take care of their kids. They don't fuck with other animals unless they need to. The the right amount of food, they create almost no waste. Meanwhile, you've got this, blow it over intelligent. Eight days running around going, we invented the world. We can do whatever we want with it were abusive towards the planet that we live on. I don't think the universe would slap

Speaker 3:          01:37:16       around a little bit. I don't know. I mean ultimately I don't know if the universe is an entity that really contemplates these issues, but if it was, I mean if you really were examining the life of human beings in comparison to the life of everything else on this planet, you would have to assume first of all, that there's just so much inspiring potential for creativity that comes out of this one weird monkey that makes mouth noises and expresses itself through facial expressions and and, and written language. There's is a very, very bizarre creature that human beings are, and I would say if I was completely objective and had no connection whatsoever to human beings, I would say that fucking thing is way more impressive than ants. That thing is flying through the air and metal tubes on a daily basis all across the world. That thing is sending video through the sky into a fucking phone that slips into his pockets.

Speaker 3:          01:38:10       That thing is driving on this hard surface that it's laid out all over the world. These internal combustion engines are powering these metal boxes. They pulled the metal out of the ground and forged it into the form of metal boxes. Then they've covered these wheels with rubber and a fucking explosion, a controlled explosion inside this iron cast iron block is forcing this car around. They stop in these places where they pull out this fueled that they've taken fossil fuel from around the world and tankers and pipelines and they've, they've, they've processed it. It is gasoline that they can then pump into this car. They paid for it with a credit card. Money is numbers that are on a computer somewhere. They have paper that represents this money. No one understands. It's a fucking insanely complex world. Insanely complex. If you. If you're looking at the universe, it turned me. If the universe is looking, you know, at at life on earth in terms of what's more impressive, Jesus fucking Christ.

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       There's nothing more impressive than people that disagree and also that also that fueled by the ways is killing the planet and the universe. Potentially. It might. My concept of the university universe, how's the gas having to cough up some of that shit that is being created on earth. Right? Oh, don't get too close to that. You know? I mean it's not good for us and it eventually, but I think if you look at it in perspective of like how long human beings have been here. Yeah, we've met a massive things like really quickly, but also the amount of innovation that has occurred in our lifetimes in the industrialized world lifetime over the course of x amount of hundreds of years. It's fucking staggering. It's no wonder they haven't caught up to what they're doing and figured out how to mitigate all the issues that they've created by making internal combustion engines and airplanes and pollution. Well, airplanes can only create so much pollution and that's the real

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       global warming is fucking airplanes and the world actually is it changes the temperature of the earth. When when September 11th rolled around, they stopped flying over the United States. It altered the temperature of the earth in a significant statistically measurable.

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       I mean cows farting causes a huge house gases, but in my mind as an atheist, my idea of the universe is probably a little closer to a little a statute that we have something living in complete balance with the universe, which I think the universe would respect a little bit more in an end than they would in a human, but if you tell him about something impressive, which all those things are impressive, that's certainly comes from a human bias. How do we equate things that impresses, oh, the fact that we can drive cars that is impressive for humans. Elephants watches go by and they think that's impressive. A Jaguar, let's say, can hunt completely silently in the dark, make not one noise and catch the creature that is looking for with complete and utter economy and sit down, eat that creature and then sleep for two or three days.

Speaker 2:          01:41:10       That for me is more impressive than hawkings mind or then some theory that Einstein came up with their living in balance and flow with the universe and the doing it in such a way that this creature right here, the is also about balancing flow goes. You're fucking radical. Oh, I don't know if Buddha says you're fucking radical to a Jaguar, but I think Jaguars are obviously incredibly impressive and spectacular and I'm not arguing against Jaguars, but someone was arguing against vision. Goggle can lead some food out for that stupid Jaguar and shoot it in the head and turn it into a jockstrap if they wanted to live in flow with that planet. Well, what's in flow with this poor little antelope getting killed by this Jaguar, which jumps around it well, so you decide. So you decide. Decide to some. Some gallon of Jaguar Thong. I now she's sitting out there on her pores where their headphones on so she doesn't blow her here off while she shoots at 300 win mag a Jaguar was going after a piece of meat.

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       It bums me out so hard when you see these beautiful women on twitter, the opposing with deadlines and dead rhinos and elephants just like, well, you doing this is a very weird thing. It's a very weird thing that people want to fly over and shoot like giraffes and all these different things, but then when you get into the conservation aspect of it, it gets very cloudy. It's not as simple as, you know, people are doing cruel things and killing these animals. Then posing them and taking pictures. The amount of money that's generated by these people doing that is substantially more than any other conservation effort that's out there. It gets real weird because like this rhino thing, I had the guy on Corey Knowlton that killed that black rhino and you know, I wanted to find out like what? Why did he do it? Where? Where's his head at?

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       You know what? First of all, that Rhino Fed, you know, who knows how many villagers, I mean they, they, they had all the images of them cutting up that Ryan on feeding all these villagers that Rhino was also, they needed to kill that rhino because the population is very small of the rhinos. Net Rhino is killing other male rhinos. It was a non breeding older male and it was a very aggressive and killed females killed males and in order to keep the population healthy, they had to eliminate that rhino. They were trying to figure out how to do it and this guy paying all that money to fly over there and kill that Rhino is actually better counterintuitively better for the overall population of those rhinos. Also, the $350,000 pays for Rangers. It stops poaching. You know, one of the interesting things they're doing now to stop poaching is they've come out with three d printing of rhino horns.

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       They're going to make artificial rhino horns and flood the market and Asia. Apparently these are virtually indistinguishable from wild rhino horns. They actually share Rhino Dna. They make them a Keratin and they're going to three d print these rhino horns and just follow the in Asia. It is brilliant, but it's. It's crazy that they need to do this mate. Poaching is way more of an issue for Rhino death and in in any of these exotic animals than hunting is a lot of places that we go. They discolor the whole, which doesn't cause any grief to the rhino itself. They'll color the on orange or red or yellow so that it loses the value ground for the medicinal market. Like you said, it's made a character is the same material that makes up fingers, fingernails, and heres the thing. Bite your fingernails. If you think you're going to kill cancer, bite your fingers.

Speaker 2:          01:44:24       You're speaking logically about things that are just totally based in superstitious. I mean, they get Viagra. You Fuck, you don't have to eat a Rhino Horn to get your dick hard. This is nonsense. It doesn't work either. That doesn't mean it's not like you eat red meat. It's crazy that these things are going extinct because if it would be one thing, if you ate rhino horns and it really did make your Dick hard as a rock and then you could fuck all night for days, but it doesn't, right? It doesn't even work, but yet people are still killing them for that very reason and I've had this conversation with people a lot where where I say, let's say like let you were just saying, let's say for the sake of argument, it does work. It does work. That does not give us the right to kill the animal, to the point of extinction, not.

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       Well. It doesn't make any sense because there's other things that it does. It's one thing that if you. If Rhino Horns made people super geniuses and cured cancer, then you'd be like, okay, we have to figure it out. We'd have to figure out a way to breed more rhinos. We don't want to make rhinos going extinct because they're essentially the fountain of of of Wisdom. If you kill them off, then you lose this one opportunity to figure out how this one animal developed as property that is so greatly aids. It'd be pretty ironic if if rhino horns made people the ultimate human being, but yet we're killing them off to try to become the ultimate human being and robbing ourselves of this one source. But again, you know that's a. that's a very, very strong human angle. You know the, the Rhino Ollie animals that exist on our planet, a fair game to be explored and had to look at to see how they benefit us, but how about how they benefit the world?

Speaker 2:          01:45:53       You know what I mean? The The majesty of an elephant's hole and is based around the fact that an elephant's Tusk is based on the fact that it's attached to an elephant, not the fact that you can cut it off and put it on your mental peace rosal value. Then we look at things from this human angle as opposed to this planetary universe type angle, which some of us do, but again, with the rhino thing, the conservationists that are trying to protect the rhinos, they all agree that you have to kill the aggressive non breeding older males in order to keep the population healthy. Yes. So like this guy going over there and killing this rhino, it's very. The whole thing is very cloudy because it's very counterintuitive. Right. Have you seen Louis Thoreau's documentary on African Safaris? Yeah. Fascinating. Because all of these animals that he.

Speaker 2:          01:46:37       When he went to those South African hunting camps, all those animals were on the verge of extinction just 20 years ago and now they're flourishing, but they're flourishing and these camps where you can hunt them. Right. Ken Hunting, it's so weird. It's. There's a lot of places that he's not allowed to go because of that, because of a few things that louise done, like he's, he, you know, he's obviously quite a controversial documentary and it shouldn't be. He's up. He's amazing. He's fantastic. Nothing controversial about what he does in my opinion. He's just honest and thorough and, and brilliant. I mean, I think what he did with that hunting camp, it really exposed how bizarre that whole world is. This show called the bizarro world or something. Louis Ck is bizarre adventure. So bizarre. It's not lucy, Kate's luther, luther, um, I forgot what it's called, what the name of.

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       I don't think he can go to South Africa at the moment because of upsetting some people in South Africa about something, you know? Was it because of that or were there different, different thing? Super. Well, I know a scientology is doing a documentary on him. Oh, well yeah, because he's doing a documentary on them. So they decided to do a documentary on him and he said, watch. Yeah, well I want to watch both of them actually want to watch what kind of crazy shit they have to say about him. Like what they do nutty thing. Have they concocted, they do free. I think it's free brunch or free lunch on a Saturday near where I live and you see people going in there full, you know, from a personality test. Eleven 30 to 1:00 and people would come up and be like, are you enjoying the chicken?

Speaker 2:          01:48:10       Yeah, you want to come into this little tiny room with me and answer a few questions like, fuck, I hope all the homeless people go and get free food often, but shit like that gives me the willies. Organized religion in general gives me the willies. Well, they're one of the most bizarre ones because they were founded by the most prolific science fiction author the world has ever known. You know the idea that, well, he lied and made up a bunch of shit except this. This is all trip. Well, he's the statements where you said, my next, my next mission was to try and come up with a religion to do. And he did it. Oh yeah. I mean, not just statement. His ex wife spoke in great detail about his plans in order to create some sort of religion, really profit off of it. I mean, he spent a good deal of his life living in a boat, hiding from the irs, you know, because before they were tax exempt or tax free status before they had that status, they were, you know, he was, he was.

Speaker 2:          01:49:03       He owed money because they were a cult. Then they were taking money from their members and thought, oh, thanks fucking madness. Yeah, it is crazy. But the Louis Theroux thing is a. for anybody who has like a hard line stance on this whole African hunting thing, just take a look at that and you'll probably not going to change your opinion, but it'll give you an idea of the complexities and the, the, the, the weirdness involved in this whole thing of these animals. Literally we're on the verge of extinction with the one you've seen the documentary. The old guy at the end when louise like badgering him, he gets asked him and he goes, you don't understand. Africa is fucked. It's fucked. The only way these fucking animals are going to survive is if you've got to give them value. You've got to make them more. That's

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       bizarre. I gave them a monetary value to protect them. Yeah. It's very strange. Your show. I'm a is wild things, wild things with Dominic Monaghan. What do, what do you do in the show? There's a BBC show and it was at BBC America for a while. It's now travel channel. I go around the world, try to change people's ideas about animals that most people are scared of and try and evoke a little bit of curiosity and kill fear in whether we'll ever scares you. Whether you scared of little. Yeah. All we had food you've never eaten or animals or people of different color or people of different ideas about life. I, uh, I get a lot of travel and I love animals. So what had happened with me was whenever I had like two or three weeks off, uh, I would always take a trip on my own unless it was hanging out with my girl and the trip on my own would usually be pick an animal around the world and go and find the animal.

Speaker 5:          01:50:48       But to make the two or three weeks spread out a little bit, instead of going directly to the source, I would land in the capital city and spend two or three days in the capital c, go into restaurants, hanging out, hanging out in human communities and just asking them like, hey, where would I go and see a weld shop? Do you guys know about the wheelchair? I've seen it around here, where would it go? How would I take transport, do I take a train? All that kind of stuff. And then gradually made my way down. Then for the last week, try and do that thing. So my agents knew about this and they were, they were constantly seen photos of my adventures and stuff. And My um, non acting agent kind of said to me, you know, this is a show dom, like, this is a show what you do, no one does that thing that you do, like, you should meet some producers.

Speaker 5:          01:51:29       So I was like, alright, I'll meet some producers. So I sat down with different people, ended up sitting down with a guy from Canada, runs a production company called cream and he said, what's the show? And I pitched him a trip that I took to find orangutans, that trip that I took to find the whale shark trip that I took to find the King Cobra. And he was like, cool, do you have a ideas? And I was like, I have 808 ideas. And he went, all right, come up with eight ideas and we'll come back in two weeks time and write the show. And came down first episodes about ants because it's my favorite animal. And we went to Ecuador to find the army. And my plan was to lie down in a carpet of Armenians and what they call it, uh, uh, drove varmints and, and know what it feels like to have this, you know, $20 million ends walking around on top of you.

Speaker 5:          01:52:15       And will they, will they go into your ears and your eyes and your mouth and your nostrils and canicula grown human being and all that they can. And they can be. You'd have to be tempted. You'd have to be tethered you as a, as an able bodied human being. No, you just run away. Well, it depends on the type of and not really dance can kill you. Now know you get a bunch of them. I'm the authority and NS. You'd have a bunch of them climb on top of you. You wouldn't get killed. Well, you're talking about hundred of them are very difficult. Bullet answer. Extremely taut bulletins. Have the highest pain threshold of any insect sting in the world. Uh, it's right at number six. Number one is go to sweat bee, which is the equivalent of a tasting white wine vinegar. The bulletin is described as walking on hot coals with a nail in your foot, so it's extremely painful.

Speaker 5:          01:53:01       Blends living relatively small communities for since maybe 24. Ebola ends in a, in a huge group. If you were to piss off a community of bulletins, the most amount that would be on you would probably be, let's say for the sake of argument 50, which is outside the realms of possibility, but let's say 50, 51 and kill you physically. It would be painful, but it's not like debilitatingly painful. You would probably want to go to hospital to have them give you morphine so that you could go over the next three days, but it's not like 50 rattlesnakes. Buyer's not going to kill you. It's not an acute. So, so we did the, we did the, an episode in Ecuador. Um, they ended up not allowing me to lie down in a carpet events because they said it was too dangerous, but I ended up putting my naked handouts too dangerous. How so? Well, they just said, yeah, how are we going to get them all off here? How are we going to get home with the rest of the day? You're going to have 300,000 ants on your light. We're never going to be able to get the stings out of you for you to be on TV.

Speaker 4:          01:53:58       My friend Brian Cowen, he stayed in Bolivia for awhile. He was going to be some sort of a bug scientist. Whatever the fuck you would call that. What's the entomologist entomologists? And um, he was studying for it and was staying in these, uh, they had these huts where they were elevated off the floor of the jungle and they would put Turpentine on the posts of the huts to keep the ants from crawling up into your. Because once they find you, once they decide that you're a target, like you're fucked. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:54:28       Especially if you're, you. If you can't move. Like I said, if you, if you had two broken legs, you're in trouble with bullet. The great thing about blends, and you'll see this in these communities, in the local indigenous communities. When the aunts moved through that village, they'll just go off for a day and they just let the ants clear out all the scorpions. Oldest bide his oldest son and bs, all the bullshit spring, clean my house, follow me on Yoga. Ah, that's interesting. So that's a balance. Yeah, it's a beautiful thing. That is pretty fascinating. So I'm kind of interested in the concept of fear, you know, just as a rule, I think that word is divisive and negative potentially and it doesn't do us any favors. It doesn't move us forward as a, as an animal. And I kind of reject it as a concept.

Speaker 5:          01:55:10       I think things are dangerous, but the idea of fear makes you clumsy. May she made the wrong decisions, makes you do things incorrectly. So what are some of the more archetypal fares on the planet? Our heights and snakes and spiders and planes and we try to show people those things in a slightly more positive light so that you can sit comfortably at home and start to change the way your brain chemistry works with those animals. I mean, obviously you know that like, let's say for the sake of argument, you are scared of spiders, if you hear the word spider, spider will take you to negative things that happened in your life associated with spiders, inner circle that you can go off and it's feeding that negativity. But if you now put a positive story in there where you saw a spider with a friend that you were in love with and then you went off and had food that you really liked, your starting to change that pathway.

Speaker 5:          01:55:58       And if you just replace the negative with the positive, you will then feel differently about spiders and that's what I'm attempting to do with the show. So your motivation is not to celebrate these animals. It's rather than mitigate fear. But it's a bit of both. I mean, obviously we show the animals in, in the light that I like to show them, which is positive, beautiful, uh, fascinated and profoundly. Yeah. Fascinating. What's the word I was looking for? Um, where they're able to. I'll find the witness I can, but I feel like I feel like certain animals are able to actually move out of a, a description. You can't define them there, the other worldly that magical in some way. Uh, so we do do that. But uh, you know, I like to show people that at first a wild animal, the first thing of wild animals going to do is going to try and get away from you and then not initially going bite you.

Speaker 5:          01:56:51       The vast majority of wild animals out there. As soon as they a human bounce. So then you or I have to then juggle the idea of a wild animal saying, I'm not into this. I'm going to get away. And me trying to impose on them, if you hang out for a little bit, not going to hurt you and I'm going to do anything. Just give me two minutes of your time. I can achieve what I want to achieve. You can be on your way and you can see that palpably with a change in the animal's body language. You can see, I can see when a spider is okay with it. I can see when his sculpins okay with this snake any animal down with. I'm like, oh, it's okay. No, you can come closer. You can sit down. You can chill because it's animal gets it now, but at first the wild animals like, I'm wild.

Speaker 5:          01:57:32       I'm going to kill him. What are you saying? Like a wild animal gets it. When they see they say work out the day they pick up on its energy, right? They pick up on the change in energy. Let's say we just did an episode in Sri Lanka with the Indian Cobra, Monica called Cobra. What are the most iconic cobras or if no snakes in the world with those two little glasses on the back of his head, the one that the snake charmers work with. So I pull like a six foot Indian Cobra, have a stack of wood in the back of someone's house and the first thing that God wants to do is get away. So I'm holding onto it by its tail and it's trying to get wet and it's trying to get away and is trying to get away and intellectualize is in its snaky brain. Oh, I can't get away.

Speaker 5:          01:58:11       Why can't I get away? So it turns around and looks at my hand. Other reason why I can't get ways this guy's hand, so now I'm going to deal with his hands so it tries to bite me, tries to bite me, tries to bite me, bite me because I know how to hold onto his neck and low. Let it bite me. If I ride out that storm, which usually takes about two to three minutes, the snake again and it snaky brain thinks this isn't working or the normal ways that this works for me and animals got hold of me. I try and buy it. Let's go. I'm free. That's not working, and now I'm getting exhausted because I'm buying a nugget and anything for it. Maybe I'll just relax. As soon as the animal relaxes, I then chill. I then release a little bit of tension on his tail, move a little closer to sit down with it again and it snaky brain is like, oh, I'm being fed something positive.

Speaker 5:          01:58:54       Now, if there's no tension on my tail, I can move a little freer and there's an exchange of energy with a snake now. Thanks. All right. I'm not going to be aggressive because that's not working for me. All this animal that's in front of me, we chill for a little bit and talk about how beautiful it is. Talked about all the amazing things about it and then let it go and the snake won't remember that. The snakes not going to name. Then see a human a few days later and go positive experience. This is cool because their brain doesn't work like that. Just doesn't benefit snake to have those memories to hang onto because they don't generally run into humans. Our member and maybe the audience will remember it. Maybe they'll feel differently about animals.

Speaker 3:          01:59:27       So this show really kind of came out of [inaudible] came about and sort of an organic manner like this is something that you were doing anyway for no reason other than. Because you enjoy being around these animals and you have the freedom to travel and see things that intrigued you. Right? That's pretty fucking cool.

Speaker 5:          01:59:44       Yeah. I'm, you know, I'm obsessed. It could have been a show about a few different things. I'm obsessed by a bunch of different things. I love Manchester United. This could have very easily been a show about me going around the world watching major soccer rivalries around the world, Andy in street food and meeting people and every so often seen animals. I could have done that. It could have been about street food. I Love Street food. We could have done a whole episode about street food with a little bit of football and a little bit of animals. It just so happens that you know with, if you create a TV show, the backdrop of animals, it's an evergreen show, right? I mean, people want to watch shows about animals in 10 years time this, they're gonna want to watch an episode about Vietnam. Those animals are still gonna exist and they're still going to be like, oh, well I'll watch this. It's 10 years old, but he's still doing all the universal things that were do and he's interested in the world. He's interested in Vietnam. He goes to see the capital city, hangs out with animals, so it was the easiest sale to build it around animals. But ultimately it's, I mean, you know, I'm getting paid to go on holiday. Really.

Speaker 3:          02:00:42       That sounds amazing. It's cool, man. It's really cool. You love animals. You obviously have this deep affection for them, but yet you eat them.

Speaker 5:          02:00:50       I do eat some. I've been vegetarian for the most part this, this year. Um, and every so often I'll eat a piece of fish and when I was in South Africa I felt kind of weak with needing proteins. So a steak. I ate this big hunk chicken today because I felt like I was kinda low on energy and they want to come in here and be like, Hey, what's happening? So I ate something to give me a little bit of fuel. But um, I would say, uh, I don't know. I probably meet once every two or three months, something like I'm not the biggest dude in the world. So for me to, for me to get, for me to feel full on vegetables and fruit is fine for the most part, but every so often my system is like, I need flesh and today I was like, I need flush,

Speaker 3:          02:01:38       but you like animals as much if

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       not more than you liked people undoubtedly. But imagine if you talk to someone and they say, well I only kill people like once every couple weeks, every couple of weeks I feel like I need to murder. No, I hear you. That's a valid point. And um, I am working on it. I made a new year's resolution at the end of last year where I said to my family, like, I think I'm going to go vegetarian. And they all laughed at me because they were like, you eat meat and fish and you like duck and you eat goose and all this kind of stuff. And I was like, oh, I think I'll be okay. And I've struggled a little bad times this year with not eating meat because I need the energy. And the show that I do is very sapping of your energy. You're in very hot countries were up at sunrise.

Speaker 2:          02:02:22       We finished at sunset, chasing after animals, putting myself in harm's way with dangerous animals, and just every so often I'm like, I gotta I feel it to feel like I need some vegetarians will call bullshit on that, you know, they'll say like, that's ridiculous. We're just not doing a good job of monitoring the amount of protein that you, your diet takes in Keenwah, hemp seeds, whatever you need. I mean, I believe is Tofu is tricky because it's processed, you know, pro. Were you dealing with Tofu? You're dealing with very much a human created thing, right? I mean, I believe as animals, we're omnivores, right? What grazes certain things. So, um, I think there's times where your body might need a little bit, but I'm, I'm open to the idea of someone saying I can organize you a diet that has no meat and you can maintain your weight.

Speaker 2:          02:03:09       We were talking about this before we started the show. Like I use, I usually coast around about 1:50. If I drop five pounds, I look like I'm. I'm suffering from some disease where you have very unique darter requirements. It seems like because of your metabolism scenes. Her Nana's. Yeah. I need to know your history of doing this from time you were a child or just you know what the warrior diet is. You ever heard of that? Yeah, it's a the idea that you have one huge meal a day because that's how you know, people ate a long time ago. They would try to find food that would get it and then when they would feast at night and so there's a lot of people that believe that that's a really good way to manage your weight, to not eat anything at all during the day and then you eat at night.

Speaker 2:          02:03:48       I tried it for a little while just to see. I mean I didn't try because I was serious about it. Just like what is that? Even something that makes sense and you can get used to it. You can get used to not eating all day, but I don't think you have the same amount of energy you have it, but that was the other thing they used to say that breakfast is the most important meal. They've totally abandoned that. What is the most important? There is no meals, you know, there's no most important meal. The idea was that if you don't have a healthy breakfast, he won't, you know, you won't feel good throughout the day. But I oftentimes don't have breakfast. So I oftentimes do what I, I, I call earning my breakfast while I don't eat until I work out and then, you know, it's also because I like to put my body in situations where it has to work hard where it doesn't, doesn't want to, you know, like if I, if I don't have food in my body, like you're like, you don't, you can't, it's harder to push as much energy out.

Speaker 2:          02:04:37       It's harder to,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       to have the, the amount of. But then you have to focus more and then you have to force yourself into it. You know? So I put myself in, I put myself in weird situations like that just to make my body function.

Speaker 5:          02:04:47       You liked that battle a little bit. I lost that battle too. I think it is. Why is why every year or so I stopped myself from having certain things. My New Year's resolution is usually stopped. It never stopped. You kind of have added sugar. You can have that. It's so you can have bread, you can have alcohol, you can have meat. This year though, I've been cheating. Um, but I mean, you, you obviously don't suffer from the same thing that I saw from my. My thing is putting on muscle, you know, like I'll go to the gym and train as hard as I can for, you know, the size down that uh, and then, you know, I don't get as big as I would like unless I'm pounding food and that's just, it's pretty stressful on my system, you know?

Speaker 3:          02:05:29       Yeah. It sounds you're, you're a very unique situation when it comes to that. But you know, you could have eggs and eggs if you get them free range from healthy chickens, there's no negative impact. They make an egg every day. I have 22 chickens at home, so I eat a lot of eggs are shit and my chickens are like my pets. So like I'm having food that's created by pets, you know, and I feed them healthy food and the eggs are dark orange and they're filled with coleen and all sorts of healthy protein and they're really good for you. You know, you can get around killing an animal to eat them. Right? But the thing about being a vegetarian or being a Vegan is animals don't play by that rule themselves. They're constantly killing each other. Like you were talking about the, uh, the Jaguar killing the antelope and that that's natural.

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       Well, the reason why human beings are here is 100 percent because of hunting. If we weren't, if we'd never figured out hunting, we've never figured out killing how to eat animals. We, we probably doubled our brain size of never doubled over a period of 2 million years. We've never figured out agriculture, we would never figured it out civilizations and we wouldn't just wouldn't be in this position to debate veganism if it wasn't for hunting in the first place. So one of the more ironic things, I mean we are omnivores, we do eat meat and we always have a meeting. They did say it's a beautiful moral choice to try to leave the smallest carbon footprint to try to leave the smallest footprint as far as animal suffering and. But the reality is the wild itself is just fucking vicious and mean. And they, they don't give a fuck about each other. No. It is fascinating that we are so hell bent on saving animals that don't save each other.

Speaker 5:          02:07:10       Sure. I mean, I, you know, I'm lucky enough to go into the jungle a lot and a lot of people that I tell it to is like, Oh man, you go into the jungle. That must be incredible. It's so blossoming with, with life and all these, all these new things in eggs and you know, creatures everywhere. And I'm like, well there is an element of that to the jungle. But ultimately the jungle is a place of death, so it was a place of dark s, a swollen water, sudden death. Well, it's a cycle, right? It's a,

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       it's a. it's a constant continuing. Continuing reviving cycle is like things or reading things which are eating things which are getting eaten by things and it's just constant swirling. And one of my favorite documentaries is documentary on the Harpy Eagle and it's sees heartbeat eagles. Oh, they're fantastic. These fucking flying dinosaurs that are swooping sloss and monkeys off of these trees. It's just an amazing, amazing documentary and I'm just the idea that different things in different parts of the world have evolved to find their niche. They have evolved to find the way that they survive the best. And this giant crazy flying raptor that just swoops in. I believe it's the biggest ego in the world is yeah, they swooped down and just snatch monkeys at a trees and kill them and eat them. And just what a bizarre niche. Like what a bizarre specialty those monkey communities think about ego and getting the kids to get in that light.

Speaker 3:          02:08:36       Right. There is a monster that lives in this guy and this thing will end use if you see something like a big shadow that comes to log, that is the dragon, that is the gateway to don't have that as much in our world. I mean we watch game of thrones so we think that dragons exist and stuff. But in a, in the other animal communities, like the insect world, insects and my favorite animal that is fucking brutal. Gladiatorial daily life with these creatures really fucking heavy. Um, yeah. The life of the wild is very heavy. It's very strange. I was a moose hunting in British Columbia this last fall and when we're up there we came across a calf that had been recently killed by wolves, took some pictures of it and put it on my instagram feed. And it was a because it was just stripped down to the bump, but it was, was bizarre.

Speaker 3:          02:09:25       Was like if you have never seen something like that before, it's like being there like, well what this just happened. Like this happened two hours ago. Like there was blood and there was hair everywhere. And most of the main had been eaten and were like this, this is the real world that these things live in. This is it's baby. The Moose that were out there hunting, some of it's babies got captured by a pack of wolves and they tore it apart and we're, we're, it's, it's contradictory that you would find something appalling and beautiful at the same time. But it is both. It's both of those things. Sure. Because we're so conditioned by streets and phones and electricity and houses and buildings that when you were exposed to this totally different lifestyle, this totally different environment, like the wild, the actual real wild. It's this jolt of, Oh yeah, this jolt of wow. There's like, there's just a toe. This is a completely different variable series of variables that you're dealing with. So simplistically, beautiful night.

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       I was in Kenya probably eight or nine years ago and I saw as Zebra Fall Cbre Fall, uh, that was being hounded by two hygienists. The mum had gone and they saw it like it was, it was, it was trying to navigate his way around a big tree. While these hyenas would just fucking minute and they had broken or it had broken one of his back legs compound fracture like this, so it was hopping around on three legs and there was two heinous, so it would go to the left Hyena, Hyena, and the hyenas, which knew at some point that we're going to chow down on this thing. We're really just fucking me. That it would come over and they would buy it. It would fall over, it would get up again. That chase it. They'd hit it so the leg, they try and bite the broken leg off.

Speaker 5:          02:11:21       They will like fucking with it. They weren't trying to eat it for a good half an hour or so, and I was really. I was in mixed company and I was taking a lot of pitches to this thing thinking this is fucked up. This is how, in fact, the last few moments of this creature's life is going to be the car that I was in. The people were like, okay, can we go now? Like we don't want to see that. And we left and I was talking that night with the people that, that I was with and they were like, oh, that's disgusting that we, that we see this. And I was like, this is what's real. This is nature. This is life. You know, I, a few weeks ago, me and my friends in the middle of the night when we're walking around Griffith Park and we've seen fucking owl.

Speaker 5:          02:12:00       And we saw some coyotes run along the track and stuff. And then I went home and I have a few snakes at home and I started passing around snakes. When people check this, check this one out, I've got my scoping out and torrential, uh, one of my friends was like, oh, this is a normal Saturday night with say with old dms creatures and stuff. And I stopped her and I was like, fleur, this is actually normal. This shit that we were doing earlier on where we're all showing each other photos on our iphone and watching TV and put in a DVD on and playing fee for an a playstation. That's a construct that has been created to make us feel okay about life and keep a stupid so that the bosses can do what they want. This is real. We're supposed to know the name of every snake was supposedly in the name of every tree in the forest.

Speaker 5:          02:12:39       We've lost that ability and that's what I'm trying to get back to. Is it normal? I mean, I think that playstations or about as normal as beehives. It's something really procreate. People create things and they create things. Construction, buildings, cars. They create things all over the world. I think all behaviors natural. I really do. And I think even the most bizarre fucked up human behavior is natural. We are as we're natural. Well, yeah, we of course were natural. We're part of the animal kingdom. We are as a, as a creature and natural create, uh, the natural thing created by bees would be a wild hive. And honey, the natural thing created by humans would be a child. A painting is a slightly abstract version of creation style creation, but it's much more abstract than awhile. Beehive and a baby. So there's nothing natural about buildings, but yet human beings construct

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       them without any interaction with each other all over the world and they'd be like a, a shelter to keep the rain off, use natural, but like that's where it starts to trade center and then they figured out solar power and then they figured out electricity and then they figured out Wifi. Then they figured out that it seems natural to me. It doesn't seem like it should be because it's not wild because independent of human beings, it doesn't exist, but independent of bees. Bee Hives don't exist. I think he is as bizarre as our antics and our creations are. I think ultimately everything that happens is, is natural. Yes. I would agree with differences in being that we can debate whether or not we should be doing it or whether in the consequences are worth the effort that the toxifying, the oceans, the sky's the pollution. That picture that I showed you of Mexico City have fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:14:18       The pollution is in Mexico. There are creatures out there that debate. Yeah, there are. We just. We're not tuned into that vibration. There are creatures that as far as we're concerned, when we watch them silently communicate with each other, it's not silent for them. There is something, whether it's old double or something that they sent, so something that they understand that they do, we're just not in tune with the idea, you know, and and these things that we create naturally, let's say for the sake of argument, a skyscraper or a jumbo jet. Yes, I agree. That is natural because we exist and we create it. That's a. that's a natural process, but those things that we're now creating a large, expanded huge versions of boys natural. The trade senate isn't a natural building and natural building might house 10 people. I don't know how many people housed, lived in, worked in the trade center.

Speaker 2:          02:15:10       Thousands, right to enough thousand. 3,000 people were. Yeah. That to me feels slightly unnatural. A jumbo jet that can take 500 people from one place to the other feels a little unnatural. Maybe a plane that can take eight people feels a little bit more natural agent. I mean, I don't know, swollen. We've everything, but that's natural. That's what people do. I mean, there's a reason why Mexico City exists is the same time that Los Angeles exists at the same time that New York City exists is because if you leave people alone, you don't kill them off. You don't kill them off with disease or war. They overpopulate and they develop these nationally intrusive cities. Yes, it's natural for us. It's natural for us as a species to look around and go, yes, deli is completely swollen with people, but that's the natural, uh, you know, journey that the, that the country of India is going to go on and create this.

Speaker 2:          02:15:57       See, I don't necessarily think if you take out this human bias that, that is natural for a species to, that we're not supposed to read rampantly out of control. We're supposed to take care of the air and the planet and the food and do that in balance and naturally with a species. Well, the reason why human beings are overpopulating is because we figured out how to get the fuck away from predators. No reason why we wanted to fuck and make as many people as possible as. Because naturally we got eaten mean the Jaguar. The key kills the antelope also kills people. True

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       that that was a big part of the problem in a grass hut. It's really hard to fight those fuckers off. Absolutely it was. It's the reason why we left the forest. We're not in that window in that scenario anymore, so we're developing this new style of living and we have to figure out a way to deal with the consequences of all this waste that we produce and also deal with the fact that people have this very bizarre diffusion of responsibility thing going on when there's a thousand people that are doing something and that something is fucking everything up. It feels different than if one person is doing something and something is fucking things up, then you feel responsible. But if you're a part of a city that's polluting the world, it doesn't seem like it's your fault. It seems like somebody else out there

Speaker 5:          02:17:09       be fixing it. Yeah, I know. So the very. I mean, I think empathy's one of the most dangerous words on the planet, they very apathetic idea of, well, what difference can I make a plastic bowl and just forget about it. You're like, well, obviously if everyone flood that way it would be a major issue.

Speaker 4:          02:17:24       Well, I have a lot of friends who smoke unfortunately because I know a lot of comedians and I cigarettes. Yeah. And I see them throw them on the ground all the time. They throw them in the ground, step on him. My two, two of my friends the other day did it and I, you know, I don't want to just be that guy, correct people every time that happened. So I just avoid it. But fuck, it's so depressing the fact that people are just so comfortable with throwing a cigarette on the ground, stepping on it, and then it's out of their mind. Yeah. I'm going to step away from the mic for a second. That's trash. It's trash.

Speaker 5:          02:17:52       Like that's what I want to say when that happens, there's a complete disconnect and I think it comes. And this is another, you know, pull, um, comment on cigarette smokers. I think it comes from the fat that they smoke, they smoke, smell, they get to the end of it and they're like, fuck, that's a day habits. It's fucking disgusting. They throw it down. They had done with it. So it's not that problem.

Speaker 4:          02:18:13       ISO, they're abusing their own bodies so they don't mind abusing the environment.

Speaker 5:          02:18:17       Right. I know. So you say a lot of times people driving on roads or freeways and the idea behind that is, I know this is bad for me. I know it's dirty. I don't want to step it out and leave it in my car. I'm just going to throw it into the planet. Dude, I've seen

Speaker 4:          02:18:30       different Prius's throw cigarettes out the window of my favorite things. Trying to keep up, keep a running tab of Prius's, throwing cigarettes out the window.

Speaker 5:          02:18:39       Anything it feels, do anything. It looks bizarre now when people smoked cigarettes, like I was born in [inaudible] 76 until the probably early two thousands. Seeing people smoking cigarettes didn't really matter to me. I'd been so exposed to it that I was just. I didn't even have a comment about. I was just like, oh, there it is now, and I see someone pull out a box, pull out a cigarette, put it in the mouth in light. I like watching like, what are you doing? What's going on? Do you not know what's happening with this thing that you're just about to inhale it?

Speaker 4:          02:19:07       This is going to slowly poison you, but the thrill of it or the fun of it or the James Dean thing where they just want to be cool.

Speaker 5:          02:19:14       Yeah. The danger of. I mean I, I grew up thinking about all that stuff. It looks cool for James Deane to smoke it and the Beatles grew up smoking and then in the Second World War they gave them out as part of your rations so you can understand how soldiers came back being addicted to cigarettes because they're scared of death that are around death that bought out their mind. They get 10 cigarettes a week. They're all gonna smoke cigarettes, but I mean, you know, the level of education certainly in most of western Europe and in this country is to such an extent that when I see a smoke I'm just like, what are you doing? Well, it's one of those weird contradictions. So I know, I know very intelligent people smoke too, which is very shocking. Like when you know someone and they're brilliant and then they, they can't stop smoking cigarettes.

Speaker 5:          02:19:55       So like wow, have you could figure out a way to balance this whole thing out better. You'd be so much healthier but they don't self self abuse. He knows the self abuse things. An interesting thing, but I mean everyone's on their own journey. So you just kinda gotta let them. Yes, and I think everyone has advice, but sometimes you just say that to someone, just let them know how you feel about it. It'll maybe shift their perspective and they'll have this new found way of living whole. Yeah, Dom's right. You know, I think it was fucking weird. Like I just do it. I don't think about doing it. Yeah, I was, I was a lot more fucking, you know, opinion a, it's not that I don't have strong opinions now, but I, I kind of keep them a little bit more to myself in my twenties I thought that it was just a human thing to be able to kind of spit venom at people when you felt like doing that.

Speaker 5:          02:20:43       Now I kind of like grown up a little bit. I don't do as much, but unless I was dating someone who I was in love with and they were smoking, which I would never do, I found that really attractive. Then I feel like I'm in a position or my family, but like a friend, I just feel like they'd be like, well, fuck you down. Yeah, well I don't have Akila go fuck yourself. Who are you? You know God. It's true, but you don't. To kill all day every day and think about those cigarette smokers is man, they wake up in the morning, it's a cup of coffee and a cigarette. They liked that fucker and that's how everything gets started. That eight hours of downtime with no cigarette is fucking with them when they wake up in the morning. Yeah. Which is a whole system throughout the night going, okay, let's get this toxin out.

Speaker 5:          02:21:22       Let's send all these messages to the brain that this is bad and we'll deal with it, and then they wake up in the morning. They're like, oh, I feel so bad. I need a cigarette. To me. I read this booklet, said the craving for a cigarette is not necessarily the craving for a cigarette. It's the craving to stop the bad feeling of the cigarette by replacing it with the adrenaline that your body creates by putting the poison inside you again so you feel shitty because you smoked the cigarette and what you need to make that shitty feeling go away is to expose yourself to another jolt of the poison. So your system goes, okay, let's deal with this adrenaline. Throw all those painkillers in there and then 20 minutes later you get it again and then 20 minutes later did you read that book called something like how to quit smoking or five steps to quit smoking.

Speaker 5:          02:22:05       My trainer played around with smoking cigarettes while and I was like, dude, you might train econ smoke, and he called him. I had him. I didn't change his, his language as to how we refer to them. He called them smoky treats. I was like, Yukon call cigarette smells. Sounds like something you give a dog and you know he's, he's, he's little positive affirmation. I'm just gonna. Have a little smoky treat and to give myself a smoker tree. I was like, no, you're killing yourself. And then he read this book and it was the reason why he quit and I was like, let me read it. I don't smoke but I want to read it, and that was the thing that I took home me. It was this idea that it's not the fact that the cigarette makes you feel good or you love the feeling or it's five minutes of downtime. It's the fact that that concentrated inhalation of poison is taking away from the shit you feeling that you're getting from the longterm effects of that poison.

Speaker 3:          02:22:54       I don't know about all that man. I don't know exactly the way it's been explained to me by addiction experts are that when you have an addiction, like everyone talks about the cigarettes calmed them down and the way it was explained to me, he was like, cigarettes don't calm you down. What they do is they feed your addiction so you have this addiction. You're stressed out because your body is craving this thing that it's attached to. You have some sort of at a molecular level, you have this bizarre attachment to this substance that you've been pumping into your body so that your anxiety ramps up, your body needs it, and then when you get it, oh see, like cigarettes relaxed, but no, no, no, no. You're addicted to cigarettes. And that feeding, that addiction calms the craving. Calms the screaming of the addiction for a brief amount of time, and then it asks for it again. So the idea that cigarettes calm, you know, they don't really, you know, you're your extra amped up because of the fact that you're addicted to cigarettes.

Speaker 5:          02:23:47       Yeah. I was very lucky. I grew up with a with a mom who's a nurse, so my mom, my mom exposed me to two things which, which stopped me from smoking cigarettes. I mean, that's not to say that when I was 17, 18 and one of my best friends walked outside to smoke a cigarette, I didn't go, oh, let me try it and cut it up. And was like, Eh, yeah, that's okay. You know, I've danced with that devil, but my mum did two things for me. The first one was she told me about people in the hospitals that she was working out there had to have legs amputated, hands amputated, arms amputated due to complications with smoking cigarettes. So I was like, okay, that's fucking heavy. And then the other one was, she printed out a list of which we've all seen by now the ingredients of a process of cigarette, which is like, you know, fucking cyanide and whole foods and like, Holy Shit, you know? Yeah. Like you said, hundreds if not thousands of things that are a direct fight against health and your system. And I was like, I don't, I don't want to do this. Did you see

Speaker 3:          02:24:48       either Russell Crowe movie the insider? Oh yeah. The one that was all about the scientists that worked with the tobacco companies to make cigarettes more toxic or more addictive rather. Fascinating. Fascinating. Apparently based on reality too, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:25:01       I watched a inside out over the weekend, you know, this new great watch it with my kids. Watch it yesterday. So I did a review. I do this thing on twitter called at the flicks, which is like if I, if I watch a film that has had an effect on me, I do a little blurb about, about what I like about it on a, on a word press word press account. And I thought it was a really interested in movie for a lot of different reasons. One of the major ones is that the way that it's being touted and sold in La is to deal with these very cartoony light characters that live in this girl's brain. You know, Lewis Black, his anger, and he's all red. And then amy poehler is joy and she's sweet. And then sadness. Who's like overweight and has, you know, blue heron needs her adenoids taken out, but it's from, from where I was saying it is a common on the first time a human being has exposed themselves to depression and what it can do at a molecular level to that person and the journey you have to go on.

Speaker 5:          02:26:04       So like the beast or all their little relationships with these emotions and stuff. But the a story was this really dark story of a girl moving from where she moved from Minnesota, Minnesota to San Francisco. She lost a friend. She wasn't in the hockey team anymore. She had a slightly different relationship with their parents. School wasn't going where she ended up trying to be a runaway and I thought, I thought it was brilliant at first and foremost, but if it did not feel like a kids movie to me and if it was, it was a bitter pill to swallow because when I was a kid up until the age of. I went to the edge of 15. I really had no concept of depression. I didn't know I existed. I was just a happy go lucky kid. That was sad when I got less sweets than my brother, but happier when I did and for the most part I was just coasting on the second

Speaker 2:          02:26:51       till you started dating church. Someone just slamming a lot of what happened? What do you mean you want a kiss? My best mate. Fuck. I was like, Holy Shit. I didn't realize it could wear it like a cloak, you know? My whole thing was sadness was just like that. I felt the stairs. I scraped my knee. I'm sad. Oh, I feel bad. I'm going to bed, wake up in the morning. My default setting was happiness and then girls and stuff. It became like, oh man. I'm like, I've been sad for a week and it was depression and that thing in that inside out movie. I mean I cried like a fucking baby. Do you remember the short film before it? Lava with the two volcanoes was in bits where you really. I was crying. I went on a date. I was on a day. Oh, so embarrassed. You're crying on Jesus Christ and she didn't. She didn't really know. I mean she's. Yeah, she didn't know. She knew your crying. I wasn't weeping. How long had you been dating her living? Dating for a few weeks. So it's pretty recent. Like she's facing probably ready to bail.

Speaker 2:          02:27:51       She was crying and she's a girl. That's fine. She was crying at the lava thing too. You're both broken, broken and fucked up and like. What did you think? Did you see was great. Did your kids respond to the stuff in her head and did they respond to the other stuff? Oh yeah. They respond to the whole thing. They loved it. We are. We even went to the bookstore afterwards and we bought some books on it because there was a, they have books inside out books or they're kind of like into depth about all the different things and the impacts

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       of emotions, how you need the sadness and how the sadness can help you change your mind and make decisions.

Speaker 5:          02:28:28       Yes, there was. There was one thing which they changed the very less that they put into the script. Not put into the Strip that last minute, but but involved in the story. The last minute that I was, I was gonna write a scathing review about that particular thing because you know the whole thing about coal memories. All the core memories were happy. My thing was going to be not all your coal memories happy some of your memories, a dark and heavy and they define who you are as a person to the positive, but they did that at the end cause sadness Takota those coal Mary's and they kind of found the balance of like, some are good, some are bad. One of the only things that I wasn't crazy about and I thought it was potentially a little darkness, a little dark, was that when the emotions were navigating their way back to the kind of brain area, they walked through the subconscious and the subconscious was scary and dark and mysterious and black and potentially things would jump out at you. And my subconscious isn't all like that. Some of my subconscious is a tiger's drinking cups of tea with sources and asking me how I am and I'm in different galaxies. Spinning around having fun, so I do have doc elements to my subconscious, but I thought it was a little dangerous to tell little kids anything that lives in the catechumens of your mind is potentially dangerous. It was like, well, some of that could be a poem that's amazing. Or a song that you wrote or painting, which is beautiful. Like that was my only issue.

Speaker 3:          02:29:49       Right? I thought the three d abstract thing was fantastic. Fuck. When they there, they sort of lost their shape.

Speaker 5:          02:29:57       That was really bizarre. They just ended up becoming shapes. One was like a big star rolling around

Speaker 3:          02:30:02       so well done. Such a well done movie and really like you said, a movie that even though it was a child's movie, it really adults could appreciate it.

Speaker 5:          02:30:10       I felt like it was more. I felt like it will work on a love adult levels that I wrote in this review. I was like say thank you for the fact that your kids under the age of 10 might not necessarily pick up on some of the heavier themes of this movie. You will at some point reach a point in your life, wet sadness will smack you in the mouth and you have to deal with it like maybe a 10 year old isn't ready for that yet, but your 12 year old might be okay with it because they're going through some changes too. I thought it was brilliant.

Speaker 3:          02:30:39       I've spent a lot of time wondering what those things are there for like is there a reason why depression exists? Is there a reason why sadness or joy euphoria, do they serve some sort of evolutionary re? There's. Is there some. Is there a reason why they exist that we just have to sort of manage, but I mean is it really the reason why people have gotten so far because we're not just totally content with everything the way it is and there's always going to be jealousy. There's always going to be like we were talking about the actors looking at other people going, why is this? Because they've reached some point of success and it's never enough and there's some new thing that eludes them. Some new thing that they wish they could have that then thing would be better and by his thing fucked up and I don't do them.

Speaker 3:          02:31:28       What's wrong? It's almost like these are motivating energies. These are motivating elements. Motivated. I mean and the depression thing when you get. When you first start dating, it's like it's almost like burning your hand on a hot stove, like letting you know like you're dealing with something really fucking powerful here and this horrible feeling that you have right now when it's not working out. Understand this and understand the consequences of getting involved in a relationship now because it's not so easy to just jumping in with someone. It's not so easy and you learn so much from those fucking early relationships because it was the pain. Like I had a manipulative girlfriend in high school. Not Her fault. She's a nice girl. Yeah, she is lovely. Actually. She was very nice girl, but she had a single single parent or mom was quite large and didn't like men and there was a lot of lot of education going on that was probably not so beneficial in trying to get into pennies.

Speaker 3:          02:32:21       So she didn't live there. Yeah, I got in there, but she got in mind to girls. She's dirty little girl. But point being was that that manipulation that I experienced from her very on very early on, it made me realize like, oh, okay, this can happen to like shit that doesn't happen with my friends can happen with a girl and then all of a sudden we'll take your. So I had developed this intense zero bullshit policy. So when I got older and I became a man, when, when a woman would try to manipulate me in any way, I would start laughing. I'd go, that's adorable. But that's not going to have. Fortunately I have other options and so, uh, this is not going to work out anymore. So take care of. But if I hadn't gone through that, I mean I have friends that are fucking perpetual victims and they get manipulated by women over and over and over again because they're weak and I think there's a certain amount of women, whether they appreciate it or whether they rather, whether they honest about or not almost can't help manipulating men who are easy to manipulate.

Speaker 3:          02:33:21       It's like you, you can play them like, fucking let me play up. Ding, Ding, Ding. You just want to hit the tunes. It's, it's. And I think there's something, there's something natural in that. There's a, a natural predatory response to weakness in certain ways. And I kind of feel like that's all mine, all that Shit's in place like that. It's, it's almost like to ensure momentum, to ensure entropy, to ensure that energy keeps moving. And there's no stagnant, mean if you stay stagnant, you will get depressed. If you, if you don't evolve and don't succeed, you will feel like shit. If you know, if you get dumped, you know you're going to feel horrible, you better figure out how to not get dumped, you know? Just just handle it. I mean, if it goes, grown up with a mom who she admires, who is also manipulative to her dad, she also then she may potentially fall into that pit bull trap of doing that to other guys. I mean, you know, as, as a creature, as a by allegedly,

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       like you said earlier on, we have taken ourselves out of the equation of how do we solve the conundrum of staying warm at night, being protected from predators where we get our food from. We've sold all that as a creature. So our brain is now giving yourself the opportunity to expand mold than the physical. You know, most people don't necessarily go to the gym and hit the ways. A lot of people, you know, read and get an education stuff. So from an evolutionary point of view, the thing that is expanding more than anything else is our brain. Now that's positive and to a detriment I feel because we do overthink things and we do guys have into a situation, is this right? Should this be happening? To me? I think that in this you have to look at it as the same coin. Just flipped over in a different way.

Speaker 5:          02:34:58       If you have a great birthday and you get all the gifts that you want and you got a great piece of birthday cake and all your friends showed up, that's beautiful and you experienced it and you loved it and you told her your friends about it and you relive it with your friends and it was one of those days that you always think about when you go to sleep at night because it will help you go to sleep. You need to understand that the day when none of your friends showed up for your birthday pie and you and your parents go, your gift that you didn't really want. It's the same thing. You're just viewing it in a different way. You're viewing that thing is like, oh, this thing is bad. This thing is good. It's just your life. There's those things just happen. You know, and you have to have the balance of those two things.

Speaker 5:          02:35:36       So what I tried to do when I was younger, I would suffer from her lot and I, I am prone to depression. So I try and keep myself in a positive headspace, but a great way for me to attack depression when I see it comment is to say, this is natural, this is normal peaks and troughs are a way for you to understand the journey that you're in and you can't if you're. If you're getting overly high about something that's as dangerous as getting overly low about something, it's the bit in the middle. There is the balance. That makes sense.

Speaker 3:          02:36:07       So if you get overly high, there's a price to pay at the end of this ride. That has to be. If you get too drunk, you're gonna get hangover, right? Right. That hung over. It's almost worth it to experience the great buzz. Those great moments. It's like those great moments that you have when you're drunk. Boy, you fucking pay for him for a couple of days, but they're almost worth it. That is almost at the time, is

Speaker 5:          02:36:29       the balance I've been in. I've been in situations in my life where I've thought I've. I've sat around on my own and thought, I think the worst is going to happen in this situation that I'm in with this girl or this business scenario or this day that I'm going to have tomorrow. I think the worst is going to happen. My ultimate nightmare that I can envisage is going to happen and it's happened and I have to be okay with the fact that it's happened and it's never quite as crushingly bad as you make it in your mind. You know, I've been in like, I've been in a city, I've been in situations where to go where I'm like, I know we'll break it up. I just don't want it to fuck that guy and she fucks that guy. And I'm like, okay, it happened

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       and you survive it. You know? And that's, that's the, that's one of the lessons is like you'll get through it. Well that's a real problem for people who don't ever get through that and they don't realize that it's not gonna be the end of the world. I got lucky. I'm not the girl that I talked about, but another girl that I did in high school who was, I don't like to say slut, but there's no other word for. She would fuck anybody. She just, she was a maniac. She was just poor girl. She went to Catholic school. They made her, they fucked her head up. They fucked her head up. They made, they made her, you know, just the forbidden fruit. Right, right, right. Well, and also I think she was hormonally very advanced. She, uh, she was very woman, like at the age of like 17.

Speaker 2:          02:37:57       Everybody was like cheezits mess, but she fucked everybody I knew. So like when I was in love with her at one point in time, I'm sure whatever you would call in love with. So I got used to that at an early age. He used to disappointing disappointment. It's brutal. Yeah, it can be. But it's fascinating to me that you say that you didn't experience any depression at all into your 15, but then you say that depression is something that you're prone to. Yeah. Um, I think, I think I am prone to it. I think, but you never experienced it until you hit your till you started dating, didn't know what it was. It didn't really know the concept of it. Like I said, sadness. For me it was like scraping my and then I got, but it was very temporary. So it's not like you had this sort of existential angst that was dragging you down.

Speaker 2:          02:38:42       What is the point? You know? I think, I think because I didn't know that existed when it hit me for the first time, I had absolutely no defense against it because I never. I'd never seen it before. I suddenly walked around call corner and there's a saber tooth tiger in front of me. I was like, Holy Shit, that's terrifying. And it just enveloped me and then my defenses had not been built through. My formative child is to go through elements of sadness. Like I said, my foundation and my family, my parents were together. They never fought. They got on well. I had a good relationship with my brother. I was. I did okay at school. I never had those real major challenges apart from the fact that I knew I was enacted and I was like, what the fuck am I doing in trying to be an actuary?

Speaker 2:          02:39:23       Manchester is never going to happen. I'm never going to be an actor. I had banks but it wasn't like a painful physical mental and so it was just something that I was dealing with. So I don't think I had the full issued to deal with it the first time and I'm a huge fan of women and I also probably punched a little bit above my weight when I was younger because I was the smallest kid at school about super mouthy and no one could ever tell me to shut up. So I was always trying to go for the ultimate girl and every so often the ultimate bill gill to be like, all right, I'll entertain you for a week. And I'd be like, I found it. And then she'd be like, fuck you. I'm going to jog. Like, ah fuck. I can't even compete with the joke, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:39:59       So I think I didn't get myself pitfalls until the point where my parents had kind of said, it's all, you now, you know, 15, 16. They were like, okay, go, go find out who you're going to be. And at that point I, I got a little, you know, exposed to some sadness and stuff. But, um, I also, I just think it's part of life, you know, I have this, you know, on twitter, I'm constantly, not constantly, but if anyone ever says to me, hey, you know, I've been struggling with this or you know, this is getting me down, or I had a rough day or I've had a rough week. I just, you know, I'm, I'm sick with this or whatever. And the way that I respond, the way that I always respond to it is like, you know, this, this will improve. And you will get to a point where you're able to look back and say, oh, that was a dark period in my life.

Speaker 2:          02:40:44       Otherwise it's gonna all be dark and then you're going to die. Which is a horrible way to live your life. And sometimes it does happen, but you got to be hopeful about it. Um, but uh, you know, the, the way that you make sense, like I said earlier on of your life, is to know, oh, here's a dark place is a light place. Here's a dark place, here's a light place. And the sweet spot is in the middle. You know, it's, there's a great line in the office that Ricky Gervais' show. I think he ends the entire show by saying life is a series of peaks and troughs and you don't know you're in it. You don't know you're in a trough until you had enough to a peak and you don't know any peak until you're coming down the hill. And that is true of life, right?

Speaker 2:          02:41:24       Like, I don't want my life to be incredibly hectically happy all the time. I think I would burn out. And obviously you don't want your life to be incredibly darkly heavily sad because that's going to kill you too. I want it to just be cruising. I just want to cruise with balance. Balance is a huge word for me. I don't usually appreciate it. I don't usually appreciate the sun because I'm used to it. I don't usually appreciate civilization traffic because I'm used to it because it's become what it is, but I spent a week on Prince of Wales Island in Alaska and it rained every day constantly all day and we're camping. So we were in these tents and we're soaking wet and it was. So we had these, uh, helmets or a brother. I'm a headlights on, you know, there's a strap on, you turn the light on so you can walk around at night and not fall.

Speaker 2:          02:42:14       And I turned it on inside my tent and there was this, it was, it was like, it was raining inside the tent because it was just missed. It was water mist everywhere. It was just, it was so wet and just, just weird. You're just constantly drenched. I had a great time. It wasn't a terrible thing, but my point is when I came back to La and it was sunny and it was just beautiful and just driving around, I called my friend and I go, dude, I fucking feel fantastic. And it was nothing unusual going on. It was, I mean it was great stuff. I was doing a podcast, we're going to do standup at night. Everything was normal, but the contrast to being in that miserable fucking rain soaked island for five days, like all of a sudden now I appreciated it and I was like, oh, I needed that. I needed that balance. Like sometimes you need to camp to appreciate a house, show the perspective of the whole thing. I have my own issues with that light. I mean festivals way. Hoffman is way too hot. I mean born in Germany, brought up in Manchester until I was 18. A hot sunny day

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       in either one of those countries is probably a e three e four, so a big one. Oh dude, that's it. That's a day when like people take days off work and they go by and get drunk in England. You know what I mean? That's a day of work. Was January here, but like you know, 91, 92 degrees. I can't analyze it now. Like oh that's nothing. That's 100 right now. I'm sure at least, right. It's probably 100 to 110 on a bad day. Yeah, so that's nothing compared to Vegas. Vegas is brutal, so there's that. But also the the major issue that I have in la, which is something that I'm constantly exploring with my friends is unfortunately the culture for the most part is a little jaded. You know, a lot of people come into La Tech as much money as they can out of it and then leave and it's been depleted spiritually and of its soul.

Speaker 1:          02:44:01       You know, if it's community, you go to places like Barcelona or or Berlin or Wellington or Sydney where people are feeding that. See, I get the impression that La for the most part, has things been ripped out of it, taken out of it like the foundations have been taken out of it because of the perspective issue though, but the way you're viewing it, it could very well be, but I also think that one of the archetypes or characters of La, the the social walking down sunset boulevard or the cool guy that wears a white dress shoe, a white dress shirt and a cowboy hat on a Friday night. Their reaction to see as that archetype. I know the guys that are in the standard, you know the guys in the rooftop bars and standard. We go there after the company. Source of great. Damn it. Yeah. It's good food and I like the people in the tanks and stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:44:50       That's where kids are. You have the standard explain that and you go to check in at the reservations or the desk. There's a woman that is in her underwear that is in like a fish tank, an aquarium that's essentially. She's reading a book and she's not allowed to interact with you so she doesn't look at you. She just lives around this aquarium and like reads your book and is in her underwear and it's so fucking variably, aesthetically beautiful. Invariably teaching the people, checking into the hotel. Something very weird about hotel, but anyway, so, so those archetypes, their reaction to seeing something genuinely impressive, let's say for the sake of argument, it's an animal that we've never seen before, a crossing sunset boulevard and when it gets to the junction of traffic going one way and traffic going in another way, it sits in a yoga position and creates this fucking eclipse of bright hot sunlight. Their reaction to that, if you're doing the cool la thing is to go cool. Not to be like, holy fucking shit. My life just ended. That is the most awesome thing I've seen in my life. The required reaction in La is to go awesome. Those people that are trying to fit in. Honestly, I think that La has so many people and so many people that are trying to it and that's a part

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       of the problem is it's so many people are not doing what they want to do here and they're trying to and they in there, so there's a, a giant population of trying, you know, but there's also a lot of great artists here. There's a lot of great painters here. There's a lot of great musicians here. There's a lot of great comics here. I think as far as standup comedy goes, is the greatest spot on the planet earth. I don't think there's anything even close. New York is probably second place, but man, it's tough to fuck with La and I think like as far as architecture and as far as our, like there's a lot of contribution of restaurants. There's a lot of great shit in the street in downtown and there's so many people that want to be one of those musicians that want to be one of those artists that want to be one of those comedians.

Speaker 2:          02:46:57       I want to be one of those actors that want to be one of those, anything that's important and so they're trying to be that person and you're around them all the time. They're the ones who are going to go. Cool. Yeah. There's the fakers yeah, there's a lot of fakers you also move into in what I would assume to be for you, at least quite a healthy community of comics that will know each other to have known each other for 20 years that hang out on illness clubs on sunset and you have a nice little perculating community of people traveling in Java now. Everyone says hello. I don't have that. I'm the recluse, you know, so I don't hang out with actors buddy. I don't have any active friends. Well that's. I mean I'm like I'm friends with people that I've worked with full, but in terms of hanging out like Elijah and I are super tight.

Speaker 2:          02:47:39       I don't necessarily hang out with him that much apart from little gnomes, Orlando and had to say in the United States, but they have that kind of recluse too and it's me going out on sunset and certainly certainly me going out on the sunset with Elijah or Orlando Old Bailey is a fucking. Who's billy? Billy Boyd who I was in load the rings with. Played the other hub at the Scottish. Right. Okay. Yeah. That is a fucking zoo. I have no interest in is why those guys are reclusive because when you get to an Elijah Wood's status in life, it's. It's impossible to be normal. It's very hard to go to a restaurant without being this side show everywhere he goes, people must stare at them, so that's why I got like that becomes a recluse in the animal in the zoo. And what I love about being a home for me is I can control the music.

Speaker 2:          02:48:24       I don't have to listen to shit music. I can. I don't have to pay for the alcohol upon the thing that I bought into, like start off to upscale the payment of the alcohol. I can watch any movie that I want, I can. I can bring in anyone that I won't, but when I'm in a boss scenario, as I'm sure you've experienced over years, people feel like they can come up to you a little bit and then you add alcohol into that equation. I mean, I've had people in Bob's. When I'm with my buds, someone will come over with a shot of whatever. Let's say a shot of Jack Daniels. I'll come over and be like, dude, and they'll play on me. No, no, no. I got your shop. I'm like, oh, okay. I'm drinking vodka. Oh, I'm drinking Tequila. I don't want it, dude. I got your shot. You're going to a shot. Yeah. I don't drink Jack Daniels. If you want to give me a shot, Tequila, I'll drink that. Well, maybe I'm just not gonna drink. Anyway. I'm

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       with my friends. I'm just gonna do my thing. They'll get pissy and Moni because I'm not drinking their shop. First of all, I didn't ask you to come off to me second and you to buy me a drink. Thirdly, you're interrupting friends who all know each other and you're a complete stranger. I've had people put their hands on me in boss, like put their arms around me and try and walk me over to their friends without asking my permission to get your fucking hands off me. I'm not. I don't come from where you go.

Speaker 3:          02:49:31       People that know you from television or know you from the movies. They think they know and so they also think in some weird way that you owe them something. You're Charlie from last? No, come on. Come on over a table. I want my friends to meet you. I loved your show. Okay, that's great. I was in Vegas once and I had a mouthful of food. I'm cutting this steak and I'm putting it in my mouth and this woman goes, I'm from Canada. Come over to our table. We have friends from Canada that wants to meet you. I go, you fucking crazy bitch. You do want to see me eating with 20 other people. I'm just going to come over to your group of fucking friends and put on a clown hair, give you jasmine, and then when I said I'm eating right now, I said, when I'm leaving, if I leave and I've run into you guys, I'd be happy to say hi, but right now I'm, I'm eating dinner with some friends and she looked at me like I was the biggest piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:50:17       I wasn't mean to her. It wasn't, but it's that same thing, but I've also had great experiences in bars where I've run into great people and I feel like when you put yourself in those positions where you could be uncomfortable sometimes those uncomfortable positions, I'll have fantastic conversations with some random dude who makes cabinets or some shit like that or some, some guy who, you know, whatever. I'm making my own vodka, you know, want to try it. Oh, okay. How'd you get into that? And then you have these conversations with people. As long as the people are cool, but it's like you can't get cleared off of people. Here it goes again with that fucking statement. I keep saying, I don't know where I got that from, but it pop it in my head. It doesn't have anything to do with homosexual studies in general, and please don't hate to get angry.

Speaker 3:          02:50:57       It's more the exact definition of the word, which means Kuli Kuli enough when you get people put you off like that, you can get put off to people, but I don't want to be that guy so I don't hide a go out. I go to bars and I will occasionally run into drunk retards, but for the most part I feel like if you put that out there that you're just a normal person. Just how you might know who I am, but I'm fucking. I swear to God I'm normal. Most of the time you run into people kind of accept that vibe. Like you were talking about the Cobra kind of recognizing exactly what you are and figuring it out after awhile. If you put out that vibe like you can't be fucked with or you know, everybody's annoying to you, then people find you and, and you know,

Speaker 1:          02:51:39       and I don't, I don't, you know, look, for me it's just the Boston area walking around on the streets and stuff and not 90, I would say 90 percent of the interactions that they have, maybe even 95 percent of the interactions that I have a positive in a bar because it adds alcohol, that a completely different scenario and I, I don't, I don't come into bonds with my, with my backup. I'm usually having fun with my friends. One of the phrases that I use a lot in terms of animals and humans is comment me correctly. You have to come at me correctly if you're coming

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       at me aggressively, dude, I bought your Tequila. It's go dude. And it'd be like to go away, you're going to run into that. I just happens all the time. You must get insulated because you know you're associated with cage fighting and you're a big deal sometimes the opposite people. And because of that, people want to fuck with me or people want to talk to me weird or the, you know, they want to hold onto me. They don't want to feel my body around my neck that grabbed my shoulder. If you're a big dude, you're a big dude. People get weird. There's just a certain amount of weird people you're going to run into and they probably don't even know why they're acting the way they're acting. When they do, they're probably feel like, what the fuck is wrong with me? Yeah, exactly. It was almost like an out of body experience.

Speaker 2:          02:52:44       Floopy around you. Charlie shrink my boobs. And they would, they would, they would do. Let's say they met there and randomly. Oh their uncle randomly on the street, they would do stuff that would, they would never do it. I've had people scream and the Annapolis Shit fucking, you would never do that. It'd be like you'd go over and say hello to him. Yes, it's true. But you find that with fires, obviously. I mean, I don't know how many fires you know fucked with. Oh yeah, I've seen it. Yeah, I've seen them get fucked with, it's ridiculous, you know, just some people are just drunk and they also, they don't like the idea that they feel intimidated by this guy being around them and they want to like put that guy in his place, you know, I don't want to. And there's also people that are just completely delusional.

Speaker 2:          02:53:33       Like I've run into so many guys who want to tell me how if they fought in the UFC, they would kill everybody. Right. But they can't do it right now because they're busy with some other shit. I could take so many fucking people tell me that bro. My mentality, they, they, uh, they all have the same thing. Like I don't quit man. He'd have to kill me. And you're not gonna you know, like it's so many dummies out there. It's just there's a certain amount of people out there that have nine volt brains and there's not a goddamn thing done. No, not in the books. They can read. Not enough life experiences. They just have shit genetics. Yeah. And that, that, that, that's real. We've been taught that everyone is born on an even playing field and it's about you to find yourself. Know there's some people that are ditch diggers and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it and it sucks.

Speaker 2:          02:54:18       It sucks if you're one of them. Survival of the fittest. Sometimes ditch diggers have smart kids, but sometimes they don't know. My best friend who's a smart guy, he's a firefighter in Manchester. He and I went backwards and forwards for a long time on the fact that he thought that he could take Rhonda Rousey. She will break both big. Is He? Oh, he's like, Yo. Size because he know how to fight. He was a tough guy at school and like those dickheads that you see in the street, he's like, yeah, but I'm gonna let gill punched me in the face and it's old. I'm like, no, run around. He's not going to punch you in the face. She's going to put you in a choke hold or she's going to put you into submission where she breaks both in rounds and then she stands on her face.

Speaker 2:          02:54:53       She can tap grown men who are professional fighters. I've seen it. Yeah. You know, if you just eat, you just don't know. There's a level of talent and ability that some people have that it sort of supersedes the sexual. Totally. The, the, the ideas that we have, the classifications of, you know, man can't beat up a woman or a woman. Can't be the man rather. Yeah. They know they can. There's just as other girls, cris Cyborg. She, she'd beat the fuck out of most man, you know, and, and do it in a, in a very manly way. And, and Rousey's technique is so strong that you can't fuck her judo spectacular. And her arm bars are amongst the best I've ever seen in any weight class with men, women, anybody. She has. She's phenomenal. One of the scariest dudes for me, I think he's been injured for a little bit, but I saw him.

Speaker 2:          02:55:39       You, you come and tell you on this fight, and it was truly terrifying to watch was Rory Macdonald. Oh, rory. Rory Macdonald owned some English guy where he broke his cheek and broke his nose. And I mills. Yeah, I watched it, I couldn't believe what I was saying and I rewound it and the reason why he went off like that is he got cool. Roman Donald got caught by something and you said it, you were like, well, we got caught. He got caught. He tied the guy out, put it on the floor and was like, fuck this nonsense and destroyed his face and he's got like a terminator vibe going on with man. He's just like calling. He knows. Yeah, he goes dead. You're dead because you want to judge CNPS boys. Yes. Yeah, he's trained on there for us, a hobby and Montreal. He was phenomenal. He.

Speaker 2:          02:56:24       Is he injured? Is that. No, he's fighting for the title. July 11th. Good Fan in Vegas. Woohoo. That's the undercard of the Joseph Connor Mcgregor fight. He's fighting Robbie lawler. Who's the champion right now. It's a wild fight and good luck to him and it's great fun. What about jsps? He done hopefully, uh, you know me, I have a different stance and the rest of the UFC, I think they'd want them to come back because he's worth a lot of money. I think he's had enough, yeah, I think he's in his thirties and he took a tremendous amount of punishment and his career and did the greatest thing you could ever do. He won the title, defended it a bunch of times, in my opinion, is the greatest welterweight and history and it's not going to get any better from here. You know, he's taken over 800 shots to the head in competition in the UFC.

Speaker 2:          02:57:09       I think it was like 880 something that counted as one and that's just in training. I mean that's just in fighting, not training. Yeah. I mean one of the saddest things I've ever seen in UFC is when you spoke to I think after his fight and he was like a little rattled and he was like, I'm going to take a break for a little bit. And you were like, are you retiring? And he was like, I don't know, I need to step back. And I looked at this guy that was caught like a Greek God and I thought he's about to cry right there, like he's done. And the pressure on him to come back, I think he's really unfair because like the most precious thing for him to hang onto now is his mind. And he was like, he was just about to lose it. Well, you know, he's had some memory issues. You know, we, I had him on the podcast he was talking about he didn't know whether or not he's been. It had been abducted by aliens because he would have these moments in his life where all of a sudden

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       he was at home and he didn't know how he got there. And I was like, Whoa, that's not aliens. Like these are, these are probably issues that you're developing from trauma. But in his mind there, it's almost alien. It's like something's wrong. And you know that when you start talking like that and you. I mean, it's not like he's talking like that and he has no history whatsoever of being hit and no history whatsoever of any sort of brain injury. You know, you're talking about a guy who's just fucking job is to break people's brains, you know, and he's training with other trained killers and they're hitting each other on a regular basis. You can't, there's a point of no return, no return in fighting and you got to realize where that point is and it's very hard for fighters to recognize that they need someone to help them and talk to them about it. But George is one of the rare few that did it on his own terms while he was on top as a champion retired. I applaud him for that. I think he's amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:58:58       Yeah, I think he's fantastic and he seems to have come from a foundation of supple and obviously it doesn't come from this country and it feels like he has a nice kind of backbone. But yes,

Speaker 3:          02:59:07       plenty of money to. He made a lot. I made millions and millions of dollars. He made more money than anybody, so hopefully he'll be fine.

Speaker 5:          02:59:14       You know, one of the things that happens in the football community in the soccer community in England is that these very talented, very elite sports stars that have no idea how to do their own washing or do their own groceries or write a check, get taken care of for probably 15 years and get spout the other side when they're 35, huge amount of depression in retired football players because they, now they're in the scrappy at 35 and they look around and go, I have this incredible talent which is now no longer needed and I couldn't functioning society in a way that most people do. So they're in no man's land and node. Do you find that with.

Speaker 3:          02:59:53       Oh yeah, it's even worse because they're brain damaged. A lot of them. I mean there's a certain amount of brain damage almost every fighter has by the time they reach 35. And uh, I mean we get, we experienced that with all sorts of athletes in America with its football players, basketball players. It's a crazy thing because most people, they have the highest earning potential when they're older. You know, as they get older, they make more and more money to become more and more successful and then they retire with athletes. It's the make the bulk of your money when you're young and wild and irresponsible and impulsive and then you're supposed to try to hold on to that gold dust as you get older. I think we're at a new show on HBO is about this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Little funny, but we just ran out of time. Just hit hit the three hour mark. I love it. Thank you dot. That was awesome man. I really, really appreciate. It was a really fun conversation. You just do this more often. You're around here, right? All right. Let's do it. Alright. Alright. Dominic Monaghan, ladies and gentlemen, dom's wild things on twitter. Tweet him, tell him you love him. See you.
