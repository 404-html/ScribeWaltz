Speaker 2:          00:01:20       where else can they get your shit? You still have a myspace page up with all your music, right? Yeah, but then move that to another site eventually. Man. I'm like behind on every fucking thing, man. I got to put out the mastering the twister DVD. I did. I'm so behind on everything, like musicians are still using my space. Some of them, right, because it's convenient. Yeah, it's got that music player that you could see your, uh, your views or your hits. That's pretty important to music. That's super important. If you have thousands of hits on one of your songs, people are gonna go, Oh shit, let me check that out. If there's four hits, paper just going to bypass. Right? And when you embed a video, you can embed it with the number of hits in. It can't show. That must be something new. I don't know about that. I mean if you embed like a youtube clip or you see as the window, you don't see how many videos are, how many people have watched this for, you know, but that would be a good feature I think. But no one goes on my space anymore, you know, I'm always on my website. 10 Planet j Dot j Dot Com. I'm on that motherfucker like, you know, like Joe on twitter and shit all day.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       Okay. So if they want to see your music though, they could still go to myspace.com/the twister. Those are all old videos and shit. They're like three or four years now. Old. So. But they're still bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Brian, what are you doing over there, buddy? Just fine. Tweaking the audio. Fine. Tweaking. Find does become quite a podcast mogul. He's been broadcasting, not just this podcast, but the uh, the unfortunate brody Stevens projects that was. Did you watch any of that?

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       What, what, what was your going and call it that? The unfortunate brody's project. It looks like he's going crazy. Yeah. Then that way he's allowed to get crazy. I just think I need a taser though, you know? I think if we do that, it's a character character. Just it's like, I think it works great for standup comedy, but I think for a podcast, I don't know, it was hard because I felt bad for the last episode. He brought his roommate on again, any screamed at his roommate the whole time to the point where his roommate I saw look like close to him and his cheek was twitching because he was so upset and then I went outside because I was freaking out. I went outside and he comes running outside and goes like in the middle of an interview he just took off and brody was just left there on the couch going, oh well, you know, I don't know what he was doing, but the guy who's like, I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do. I can't take this anymore. And like he was like, he just got raped. That's what, that's what, that's what the conversation was and that's when it came to the conclusion that what happened is, is that they act together. Him, brody Stevens in his roommate act together, like if a couple were to break up and they had to live together for like three months, you know, like that, that anger kind of that and it just, I don't know, man. It freaked me out. Real

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       fucking anger to money ever been around someone when they, they, they're breaking up but they still haven't moved out yet and then the chick start seeing another dude. Then they have complications or the guy starts seem the check that that would never happen. I would never put myself to that. I mean you have to be a brokester and understand or some kind of. I don't know what's going on with the lease or something. Maybe there's like a problem. They're both on. People just love drama. They never figured it out. They never figured out how to be cool with each other from the moment of their relationship, but just a, it's an eventual explosion. It's like, how, how fucked up is enough to get before it all falls was the only way I could understand a situation like that is girl breaks up with boy, boy is begging for girl back.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       Girl goes, you know what, we're not getting back together, but I'm fucking staying here for two more months because I paid the rent and boys like, fuck it, stay in it. It's like it's going to give them more time to maybe change your mind. You know what I mean? Yeah. I could kind of see that when I broke up. I lived with a chick a long time ago. The first time I've ever lived with very nice girl, but we were both kids. You know, I was 21, she was 20. We were both retarded. Right. And uh, when, when I lived with her and we broke up, there was a period of time, like for like two weeks we were still together and she was still like staying in my house, but we were, we were not together anymore. We'd broken up. So she had started dating other dudes and I'd start dating other checks and you know, she'd be cool with it and then she would tell me about dudes and I wouldn't get jealous, but I would tell her about a chicken. She get mad at me within two weeks. She's 20 years old, man. Twelve years old. You're retarded. You don't know what the fuck's going on in love with her? No, no, no. Definitely not because I didn't freak out when she left, although I did try to get her back on. I came off like a huge. I

Speaker 4:          00:05:57       don't know if you've ever done that before. When you get devastated by a check and then you try to figure out a way to bring a bag. It's almost like an ego thing really. It's like the relationship was boring. Did she break over there? Yeah. Yeah. That hurts now. How long were you guys living together before? Not that long, man. I did not last very long. It was a disaster. Six months maybe. Something like that. That's not enough. You can get deep and six maybe not even. I'm not going to think it was six months. She was a nice kid. We were just young and stupid and. But she started banging other dudes and I started banging on the trucks and it was, it was real weird because we're living together and every now and then like she would get horny and I'd fuck her anyway.

Speaker 4:          00:06:32       It would be. It was very strange. It was like a retard retard relationship. Shit. Like the shit you do when you're 21 usually. Generally when someone breaks up the girl generally for most people the girl has so much more power than the guy. The girl can bank 10 dudes that day they broke up like the guy like the guy might not be able to get laid for a couple of weeks. He hasn't been in the game for awhile and that's the reason why they're breaking up was because the guy found someone to already. That's true. That's track tracking. Boston marijuana lived. It was way harder to meet people. This is not the same place, man. People are not nearly as friendly. It's not nearly as easy to go out and meet people or going to a bar or club or whatever. It's a fucking grind. It's not easy and everyone's in jackets. He really don't know what the fuck you're getting. You don't know what you're getting here to look at girls jeans, how vacuum sealed or these fucking things like clubs, even clubs you really can't tell, so some girls can cover their fucked up shit. When you get them naked, you're like, Whoa, fuck. They confuse you.

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       If you go into a club there, they got glow sticks, they got glitter, they got fake fake. It's dark and they got so much fucking makeup on and the covering the ship strategically, they know how to cover them. Rolls Up. How crazy is the idea of dollar club? How close crazies the idea of a nightclub, he go to a place. It's a designated meeting area where everybody goes that supposedly is single and wants to fuck. You know? It's like, can you get it? That's the big question. Can you meet? Can you meet somebody? Are you compatible? Do you get it? But we're going to provide you with music, so you get to move around and grind against each other. We're going to give you drink so you make shitty decisions. We're going to set you up in a place where it's probably going to be people that are selling drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:08:21       If you were going to do something more fucked up, it's all together in one big spot and we stay open until 2:00 in the morning. That's one place. I never pick up chicks that though I never pick up chicks at the dance club because if I'm dancing it's an acting a fool. I'm not like taking it serious, like breaking it down. You know what? I was totally the opposite. Like for me, I swear for me when I was like 21, 22, the way I would make moves on a check is I would find the best dancer and then dance with her and I always thought like I could just, I could get them with the dancing man. I

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       was dancing before I could even walk. My aunts would just hold me out because my ad to answer a couple of years older than me and they were just holding me up and everyone will be dancing like fucking fools all the time. So you still dance? I went to school dances. I was always dancing. Do you still dance one once in a while. If I'm at a club and they're playing some good shit, you know, some good fit is sam or something. Some new ludicrous or something. I'll be dancing. Got To be good though. Oh sure.

Speaker 3:          00:09:26       That's wake the fuck up. No, you know what that is? That's an alarm. Call Your Business Manager. Check on your funds. Like everyday it goes up. Keep keep that shit going every day. But I usually wake up reminder to check your fucking money. Dude. Slow down. What are you spending too much money? I don't keep track of it. Yeah, that's my problem. You know when they get a business manager, I don't have to keep that. I'd like, you know, I always envied you man. How many years did we know each other? And you had a business manager and I had a handle all my shit and do all my taxes. You never worried about shit since I've known you. You just have a credit card and you don't worry about shit. I remember a couple of times you told me go man, I could have 2 million in the bank.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       Um, I didn't want to disclose that. Okay. Okay. So anyways, he brought the comic books. Have you, did you grow up liking comic books? Um, no. I never read comic books, man. It wasn't into it. I was, I hated. I hated superheroes, man. I wasn't into him. I was spiderman for Halloween and it's so weird playing the role of like a superhero at a party, like A. I went to this huge party and I was dressed up as spiderman and I realized when I had to walk around the party, I was walking around the party like I was spiderman. Like I wasn't just stepping out like, like I didn't do it on purpose. I just, it was so wrong. I was really stoned in it. I don't know if it was weird. So you're really still in. You thought you were aspiring. I just caught myself walking differences.

Speaker 3:          00:10:55       The same dude by the way, that. So that he doesn't like certain video games because now when he sees buildings he wants to jump from one building to the other. This is, play this in games. He actually thinks that he could go do that. No, no, no. He won't know what you're getting lost in the character, which is totally cool, man. I was talking about. I played so much of this particular video game in a short amount of time, like, like, like all day long that it got to the point where I was driving and I'm just like kind of space out and think, oh hey look at building. I could jump on it. I could see, you know what I mean? I thinking of retarded shit. You never usually want to talk about thinking about that shit. Like man, like I'm actually thinking about the fucking video games jumping around just because you played how many hours straight dude plant. Uh, at that time I had played it for like all day long. I wake up, go to bed, you know, that's ridiculous. For a month though, that was the only time I ever became addicted to my little nephew. That's his problem right now. They got to take away that fucking game controller because he plays all fucking dates, fucking up his grades and all that Shit. And my sister's like, oh, we only

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       let them have that video game on weekends. And they got, they take the controllers and they fucking hide them. He goes looking forward and breaks them fucking roll. So all they really need to do is have like a video game controller, like dealer at school. I hit little plug in. How easy is that? I'm real lucky that I didn't have video games when I was a kid. I mean we have like stupid, like the ones on tv that you, you'd play like a. I forget what they were, but they weren't. I think Mike Tyson's punch out. I think we had that. I think that was like when I was around high school, I had a Atari the peasant later. That was all I had. That wasn't data addictive. I mean it was okay, but there's nothing like call of duty or it was amazing back then.

Speaker 4:          00:12:34       Space invaders at your house. It was amazing. Like fuck. Yeah, but I'm talking about the sheer at diction value of it. It's not even close to the video game Sunday. No, these people are having real problems with their kids starving. It's like a regular basis because they're not feeding their kids because they get lost in these massive multiplayer war. A world games like world of warcraft games, man. This substitutes these people's lives like the sims and there's farmdale girl just beat her kid to death because the kid was crying and it was interrupting her Farmville game. Yeah, it's fucked up. You know that new call of duty game that came out last night? Modern ops or whatever. I don't even know what the name of it is. I just saw that it's in three d. that's one of the first video games to like release to be made to be played on a three D tv.

Speaker 4:          00:13:18       So you know that three d we saw the other day at this by Holy Shit and playing call of duty. Now, dude, I did not realize how bad ass three d looks now with, with a movie that's animated for Three d and then you get one of those three d glasses and you watch on the new three d TVs. It's fucking incredible, man. It's just like, it's overwhelming. Like you look at it, you're just going, wow, isn't it weird that it's fired me taking off? I mean we had three d back when I was 10, but it's not taking them out. It's a huge fucking trick. It, it came out almost a year ago. You know how many blue ray DVD, three d movies that they're out to, two or two or three. I think the third one just came out the other day, like hd, same thing.

Speaker 4:          00:13:56       There wasn't going to hd channels, but you stick around, there's no way to. D is going to fuck with three D, three d, it's going to take over all. They're making all movies in three d now. Like every shooting porn in Three D. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. They've been doing it for awhile. That's still the way to bring porn back. How are you going to do three d? You can download three d and that. Ultimately you'll be able to doubt it's going to make a big company. We invest in porn. Is that like a market? It's got a bit. That's actually smart. That's actually. That doesn't make download bruises pop off the TV. Right? You could smell the food for sure. For sure. That kind of have loads coming at you. You're gonna have to dodge a dodge them know there's going to come right at the screen and then we're going to shoot through a girl's face and she's going to be able to cover the loads, the loads coming from behind the camera or something.

Speaker 4:          00:14:46       Right. Imagine. Imagine if it was so good though. If you had a wall projection TV and the legs were just being wrapped around you, it's really going to be gay porn and that takes off from three because what could a girl did with three d while she's having sex? Like the titties coming at you. I mean, how often are, it's just pop it, you know, the depth is way better when it's not just that, you know, you'd have like tricks that was like old three, d number, jaws, three d. There was only one thing that happened that the shark went through the glass and you're like, ah, he's coming after the rest of it was bunk. It was like tricks, but now it's not tricks. It's like they're doing that. Yeah, it's like that. What was the monsters versus aliens is. That was the animated show that we were watching.

Speaker 4:          00:15:24       That was in three days. It was insane. It was so vivid and there was so much to it. There was like the depth was like. It was really shocking. Yeah. That's what it's going to be. Pretty soon it's going to be like where you look at your wall and it's like you're looking into the next room that bats what's going like you're watching Seinfeld, like as if Seinfeld was in your house. If it's gotten as far. I mean, what it looks like. It's pretty fucking incredible man. Way better than the movies because movies a big or what happened last shit went bro. We lost one of the channels for the head. That's what happened. All on the same as you can get more creative with gay porn, you know, lost loads. We're losing. Well you've got a bad connection on the headsets. All right, so anyways, it's in there, but it looks way better than the movies because movie theaters, it's like kind of shitty resolution.

Speaker 4:          00:16:16       It looks like grainy, you know, even if it's a gi, it's better. Even if it's a giant screen, it's not nearly as good as like a giant, like 55 inch plasma screen. The depth that you get when you look at it like a real good tv. That's like the resolutions like way crispr did you see jackass in three days that was using old school, three detectives. Dildos coming towards your face. So chapel wasn't using depth. That was act. They actually slowed down like things that you could see it come at you and they really. That was the best movie that for the Three d content. Real awesome for three days. All I kept thinking about is, I mean they're, they're getting fucking some head trauma going on there, really jacking their heads up for sure. At least one of those dudes, one of those dudes is going to have gehrig's disease.

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       You after watching that show on brain brain trauma, that was real sports. Yeah. What it was. Are you more aware of that shit? The whole time I was watching jackass, I'm like, God damn it. It's funny. It's all fun and games right now. You're making a lot of money, but they are really fucking themselves up. I mean, I saw the interview with Michael, not Michael. I'm with Muhammad Ali when he was Cassius clay and he was talking about retiring when he got to be a certain age because I don't want to be one of them to fighters is old and it hit in the head too many times is talking Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah role. Whoa. Yeah, whoa indeed. It was like, it was so creepy to. To listen to that. Like you, you're the king of dirt or you're the guy. Whenever you talk about anybody where anybody looks towards someone getting damaged from fighting

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       in it being a sad case, he's the one and there's a lot of people that are trying to say that he has Parkinson's. It's not related the fuck. It's not related. That's a bullshit politically correct argument. Yeah. He's got Parkinson's. What does that mean? It means it's fucking brain is falling apart and why do you think he has it? You don't think that has to do with the fact that he got battered in the brain for decades. You don't think that has something to do with that. That's crazy. They had this thing on 48 hours with Jerry quarry. Jerry quarry was like this great white hope from the 19 seventies and they followed this dude around and he was like 53 years old when he died and they followed him around when he was 50 and he was gone, gone. There was nothing there. He had no idea what was going on, didn't know how to write his name.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       His brother had to help him write it, so he had Lou Gehrig's disease. He had everything. He had pugilistic dementia, that's what they call it. That's what they were calling it. No, as far as is it Lou Gehrig's disease? Lou Gehrig's disease is is the same thing that Stephen Hawking has. It's your, your, your, your body loses its ability to move itself. There's a bunch of different things. I mean, Muhammad Ali has Parkinson's, you know, this guy had pugilistic dementia, which is just dementia brought on by being punched. The whole deal is, you know, it's, it's scary because we see it all the time, man. We see guys getting checked in the head all the time. You know, it's a big part of what we do.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Trill Shit so much fun to watch though. God is willing to put their brains on the line for our entertainment. Well, it's just they gotta know when to stop. That's the thing. I mean, you can do it a few times. You can, you can even get shut off a couple of times, but you gotta know when to stop and it's everybody's when is different and that's when it gets tricky. You know? No one can tell you. Remember Alastar overeem when he was getting knocked out all the time and I lost our overeem, was getting like jacked over and over again. Surgery Keratan off Jack Damn. Chuck Odell, Jack Them, a lot of guys stopped him. I think he's been stopped like seven or eight times, at least six. So I mean he had been beaten up a bunch of times both in kickboxing and in an, in an mma, but then all of a sudden he makes his fucking tremendous come back and now he's one of the best fighters in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       So it's like you can't never say that a dude's done because he made a comeback and then made a Sitcom back in striking and k one, you know, the fact that he was able to have that kind of success in just straight striking. I mean, that's, that's pretty God damn process. So you can't tell it got to stop because I would have told Alastar over him and stuff. You know, who the fuck are you? When do you draw the line? Is it five cows for cows? You know, I think Peter has been stopped some crazy amount of time, like 14 times over the course of his career to something nutty like that. Think about that, huh? Yeah. What if they find out? What if they find [inaudible] get to is fairly new. What did they find out that, you know, if you get choked out like unconscious, like from a rear naked choke or at Doris or something like 20 slash 25 times you're, you're susceptible to get Lou gehrig's disease just from getting, you know, really getting shut off. I found out. Who knows? I would say that they know that you

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       can be deprived of blood to the brain for a certain amount of time before there's damage set in, but how do they know that? I mean they, they know that people have gotten damaged because there had blood shut off to their brain for x amount of seconds or x or is it a minute? I mean how, what is the amount of time where you start getting brain damage? Number two, what? This one's where you're saying like if you really hated somebody, you'd choke them out, but not to kill them, just hold on for 90 seconds and started and that's a character who wanted to develop a guy who's like, he's like a, like a dexter or you know, he just kills people, but he doesn't kill him. He just chokes him out just for 58 seconds just to turn them into a vegetable so he doesn't, he doesn't go down for murder.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       No one knows how this person became a vegetable and they just make it a romantic comedy. And then like one dude and the conflict is three jokes becomes a level, does it for money. He's just like the secret assassin. He's not killing anybody. He's just turning your enemies into like you pay them. And then one guy, he didn't choke long enough and the guy can kind of talk and he's trying to bust them out so he has to figure out how to fucking get near him again to choke them out of the guys pointing out was like, I got to put this motherfucker and an arm triangle one more time. But Tom, but it just, so that missile thing a lot of people don't notice, but there was a missile was fired last night off of the coast of California. Malibu area. Yeah. I heard it on Carson radio show this morning.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       And he said that, you know, he, that's where he lives. He didn't see anything and he had all these radio show. Carson Daly, Carson Daly has a radio show on k rock. I think he does. Yeah. In the morning kid rock is Kevin and been a, I think maybe after, uh, but he, he, uh, he was saying that he didn't see anything. So he had all these callers calling and then it was like two hours later everyone said they saw something but not with the time that everyone else is saying so. Well they have pictures of it. Yeah, it is. Something happened. Yeah. There was one before that happened. I remember I was driving, I was in Hollywood and the sky was like, it was just turning dusk, so it was kinda like half dark, half light. And they launched a rocket and you could really see whatever this thing was, this missile you could really see like the contrary all behind it and everything.

Speaker 4:          00:23:00       It was pretty dramatic, you know? And then they had a, you know, tell people that they do these things at night and that this one was a, it was from at Edwards Air Force Base I guess, and they shot it at night, but it was just not dark enough. They miscalculated the time so people get to see it. So it's like, what do you mean they just shoot shit up in the air. Did they do this all the time? Yeah. My friend is in the navy, says they shoot missiles all the time. Where do they go to the water shoot dead missiles. And imagine if you were in a fucking rowboat and nobody knew you were out there and you got hit in the head by a missile. Just a random mean people have been shot. They've been shot by people shooting up in the air. The bullet goes up in the air and then lands on people. That's happened a bunch of times. Could you imagine if you got hit in the head by a mess?

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Jones is saying about this missile thing or if he even knows about it, how it is. Basically the new world order, the elites. I'll move. I gotta move my fault. The new world order. The elites know what the fuck would he say? He would say something stupid. It was Obama. Say something about life extension. We had a crazy experience in Texas with Alex Jones with show ideas. What happened? Joe? What did I met? Lit the Alex Jones show on fire. What? Off Milestones fucked up and this is where he fucked up. He had joey come on and it was his idea to bring joey into the room. He's talking to me about what about chem trails? What about what about what's going on with the environment? You know what's going on, what about they're going to kill the dollar. So he's got all this stuff that he's bringing up with me and then Joey's outside and we're just talking kind of like straight real conspiracy theory.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       Alex Jones style. But he brings Joey in and we. We were at the end of the show, so he goes, well, we're going to go into overdrive right now and we're going to overdraft super secret overdrive a lot on the Internet, but uh, you know, you can swear it's all right. It's not FCC, but don't try not to swear. So He'd fucked up. He gave the green light to joey. He let joey know that Joey can just go off. And so joey starts going off. First of all, he's going off about Cuba, about how this is a free country. Well, the real, when it really went awry, it was when he started talking about smuggling drugs. He goes, I got get on the plane. I had the sack under my ball sack. I put the sack of weed and I was thinking like a motherfucker and he's going, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       Alex Jones going, no, you didn't. He goes, no, I did. It was under my left arm and left leg than my right ball because I'm right handed. I thought I had cancer for awhile. So. And he just goes deep. Joey dss as an, as Alex Jones is going. Well No, no. That didn't happen. No, it didn't happen. Cox, I got Obama freedom of speech. So He's, he's going fucking crazy. And um, Alex Jones can't figure out what to do and I am laughing my balls off. So as I'm laughing, you know, Joey, if he's got an audience and that audience is laughing, Joey knows how to finish the ages. Ages rage. It gets red, he starts getting sweaty, he knows how to finish the deal. So he's going off about how stinky this weed is under his ball sack and that he'd go through the x ray machine and he thought he was going to have to get arrested.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       And then the more more Alex Jones protests, the crazier guy, joey finally, you know Joe, he stands up. He always likes to stay up. What? He's going to end something and walk away. He's in a fury of frenzy. He goes, Joe Def, facebook, twitter. He stands up and he goes, check yourself before you wreck yourself. Big Dixon gas is bad for your health. Stay black because that's the most important thing, to stay black. And the whole time he's screaming into the microphone to make it worse so you know, he's, he's grabbing the microphone is big paws and screaming into the best part is when he first walked into like Alex Jones as studio setup where the camera's facing him like directly and he show, he just stands right in front of it and leans down on one knee right in front of the camera. So if you look at the video of you can find the video anywhere like gets just Alex

Speaker 4:          00:26:43       and then this big head like blocking his view. And then it's the cameraman all scrambling for new shots. And it's all like Joey Diaz, his head covering everyone's faces. Joe, he's a fucking national treasure man. You realize moments like this. I mean I'm giving it no justice here describing and I'm trying to describe it right? You got to see it. We're going to have it up in a video and it's available online. You can see the whole thing, but we'll, we're going to edit it, put together the right parts in a whole video of the whole Austin trip. Because Austin was and always is the shit. Every time I go there to film, it seems like magic happens. That is one of the best cities in the fucking state or one of the best cities in the world, man. It really is because it's. Well, it is one of the best cities in the state.

Speaker 4:          00:27:26       It's also one of the best cities in the country and if this is the best country in the world that that's one of the best countries or cities in the world. I just fucked that whole thing. Not only is the food amazing everywhere you go, the food is fucking amazing. Everywhere you go. The women are beautiful and awesome and nice and loved a man. It's a friendly place. There's a few spots like that on this country, man, where people are friendlier. That's one of the best ones. Austin, Texas is one of the best ones. Fucking great music, but the smartest ones too, you know, just so many smart, cool, interesting people there. It's just a. it's a fun fucking place to do worse highways ever. The GPS just tweaks when it tries to find the exit. For some reason they decided instead of make their highways wider, they decide to stack them on top of each other, so the logic behind it is so strange and if you make me miss an exit, it's so impossible.

Speaker 4:          00:28:19       Yet the roundabout it you're fucked. You're fucked. Because almost every exit becomes a new highway in another direction, you know, like, where's this one going? Steph? It's death if you, if you miss, if you miss a spot, you're fucked. But other than that, it's the shit. Jessica Alba was here. The first clip that we got those classic from Austin was the clam thing with Arctic plant. They painted that whole green room to. We did that. That was sad. The these, the green room in the Austin Cap city comedy club used to be covered with graffiti and now it's just all painted and it was like famous comics. Some comics are dead. I think Mitch Hedberg was on there and stuff and they decided to paint this green over it. Yeah. I asked him, what happened? Burger King buy you guys out. Like, fuck yeah. It felt like a Kia or something like the.

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       Why would they do that? I don't know. That was the biggest fail ever. They should. Somebody should take a picture of that green room and just call it fail. Well, someone should do is find photos of it all online and make wallpaper. Glue it back on. I took, I've taken. Most of them you should do is enlarge everything up high resolution like with some fucking Gene Hackman movie type technology where they can take a big picture and actually make it look good. Maybe we'll wait until it's LCD wallpaper and I'll just email them if a bitch. Yeah. How could they do that? Man? That was that place in the Atlanta punchline. That's another one. The Atlanta punchline to green rooms just covered with. One of my favorite ones is trying to be Hicks. Somebody had that as their avatar photo on the Rogan board for Awhile.

Speaker 4:          00:29:46       The best one was in Austin when it was always my favorite and that's the one thing I always think it's that pee on the toilet seat. Maybe we'll keep women out of comedy. No, keep the toilet seat up. Maybe we'll keep women at a kind of take my own life and I'm not a person that lifts might the toilet seat nps. I'm one of the Ip through it because I grew up with my mom and my sister and I just use. I just wash it every time he piss all over the toilet seat and know my aim is amazing, but once in a while you'll get that one little teeny drop. So it's a once in a while. Someone has to sit in your peers? No, because then I clean. I always clean it with water and toilet paper. What about soap? Was that enough? If someone pissed on your fork and then cleaned it with water and Toilet Paper, you drink pee? I don't. I don't think I'd have to worry about your little buddy.

Speaker 4:          00:30:37       I don't say it. Do it every day and it's not mine. It's his big difference between if I said, you know, if I drank p for a stunt on a radio show or if I piss in your mouth. These are two. Totally. It's like the old thing, like we just always talk about your stand wiping up or do you sit down and go through the legs? Me and Joe are both standards. Are you a standard wipe and then I jumped in the shower. I don't. I just wiped warm shower every time. Every time. Wow. What if your shower? Every time he shit, unless I'm like at a public restroom, but my shift consistent. Wow. In the morning when I wake up, 10:00, I'm ready to go. I have a bad day. I never even used that to Chris from fleshlight did he tell you about a day?

Speaker 4:          00:31:15       A day that has like a laser that finds your asshole then shoots water at your asshole at the same temperature of your skin and then it comes out with another laser that shoots and finds the hairdryer and it dries your asshole? Yeah, at some. Well, I heard about it in Japan, they have these. They're toilet seats. It's not a bad day. It's actually a system. Maurice. Maurice called me up and Maury Smith, I call me under the Joseph. This is a great business opportunity. Okay. Listen to this, starts telling me about toilet seats. I'll tell you what, it's not a bad idea because that's one technology that has not changed since I was a kid. You were a kid like that. It's the same. Wow. You got cushion. That's it. Why aren't we perfected that shit? Yeah, but no one's gonna. No one's gonna buy them. It's hard to get $300.

Speaker 4:          00:31:59       I would buy 300 bucks. Yes. Probably a lot more than that though. Probably really. Lasers, your asshole. Find that shit's got to cost like $7,000, like cheeks and shit. Probably that. You know what I mean? Blow dries you. Who has a Taser and it was $500 installed. I would buy it. No Way. 500 bucks. You would the ones that are 500 to going to miss your asshole, but how can it get your butt to hurt? They're going to hurt you, but it's going to be pounding in there. It's going to splatter all the shit around your balls. Throw some heat warmers on that. That I would do 600. They have warmers too. That's the other thing that he did the heated seat sit down. It's all warm and comfy, but Bluetooth on it. Seven Hundred Dollars Bluetooth you have from her coughing your toilet speakers behind you, like really nice bose speakers.

Speaker 4:          00:32:44       You're just sitting there talking with someone. They hear the echo and they get mad at you. Are you shitting and talking to me? I told you to disconnect the Bluetooth on the toilet. They'll have like a jawbone of a second microphone that's outside and we'll mix the two. How about to somebody that gets upset at you when you're talking to them when you're taking a shit and now I never. They never figured out. I've told people before they get upset. I've told people that this are you paying on my campaign? Is that okay? I can hear you. I like pretending we don't pee pad and a pen and a big deal, but if you're on the phone and you shit and you like your ass explodes like one of those nuclear sheds. You know what I mean? When you got to wipe you gotta clean the toilet.

Speaker 4:          00:33:21       There's only a few people that can do that with. You don't usually want to do that. Like when someone's on the phone and I said your buddy, but if it's like a girl enough for a business meeting, I have face time with our. Sometimes I fall on the phone. I'm like, well I hope they don't. They didn't hear that one. I got to pull a but apart. There was one, there was one time when he called me by facetime and he was shitting, so I was like, you know what, I have to poop to. Let's do this. Facetime. Double Shit. I haven't used the face time yet. You guys like it? Oh it's great. Now they have a Beta on your Max. He could face time from a computer to iphone. So if somebody's at home you'd be like, jump on your computer. You know? And so now you can face time between those two devices.

Speaker 4:          00:33:59       One, is that really necessary? It's like your girlfriend and she's like on the other side of the world or something. Well yeah, you know, we're all on the road. That's about it. Is that like your buddies did get on facetime, Bro. Gonna fucking do that. Well, we talked about this before that eventually we're going to have little cameras in front of us on like fishing poles. You know, her hang hanging from our fishing poles. It's probably going to be like hovering floating with you. Right. It'd be a proximity droid to miss the best technology with the oldest technology or fishing poles. Don't feel the need for it. But I mean that's what I said. I used to say about text messages. I used to joke about it. It takes you four presses to get an ass. Pardon my act. The whole thing about. Remember when you started the whole thing about next town next to.

Speaker 4:          00:34:46       They don't have walkie talkies anymore. Do they? They still do that? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I think Brazil in Brazil next tell is like fucking burger king. No Dude, they run shit. They failed in the states. They said fuck it. We still got Brazil. Brazil do next toe is huge in Brazil. Really did love the walkie talkie feature. It's on verizon. It's on all of them. You know, there's a funny story, there's um, there was this dude in front of a Roscoe's chicken and waffles and he was on a speaker phone and he was talking by himself just standing there by himself on a speaker phone talking and talking out loud. You can hear this conversation. And so I twittered I said, what is it about black dudes that like to talk on the speakerphone is when they're by themselves, like what? What is the deal with that?

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       And all these fucking people got mad at me. A lot of black people got mad at me. Yo, that's dickish. That was dickish like what? That whoa, Whoa, whoa. I didn't say shit about you. Okay. I said, what is it with all these black people that like to talk on speakerphone just because you're black and if you're doing that. I'm not dickish. I'm just observing. What is that? That's a weird thing that I don't see that many white people do them, but I see a lot of black people doing and it's not a negative thing. Like what? He does a lot of fucking douchey things that white people do too. But I'm not being racist here. I'm observing something. Are you saying that I'm not allowed to observe because you share the same melanin content is this person I'm observing and even though you're not even doing the same thing that they're doing, that's fucking ridiculous that we're, we're real close with racism in this country, man.

Speaker 4:          00:36:10       We're real close to being ridiculous. It is ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous. You know, like with especially like the whole, uh, anger between feeling like you have to fight somebody because of their race. You know, like there's people like beating up different races just because of what race does that mean? That's legit. Racism, but I'm talking about is the opposite. I'm talking about people looking to point the finger at racism when you're really just acknowledging something. That's a fact. I'm just seeing something. I'm like, what? The fact that I said that they happen to be black. Yeah. Well, so does going to be black. So why do they do this black? Why do these brothers be doing that? Or No, they just do it. I don't know why to do it. But you didn't get an answer? No. No one has an answer. No, but most people were saying their attention whores, you know, and that's what, I guess one of the reasons why people were getting mad at me as I was saying that black people were attending.

Speaker 4:          00:36:57       So which is not what I'm saying. I'm saying I see a lot of black people that like to talk on speakerphone when they're by themselves. I don't see why people doing it. It doesn't mean they're not doing it, but I'm asking. It's something I see and might not allow it to see things because people are black. Like that's a tricky fucking road to walk down. That's nonsense. You know what? Maybe it's because they don't want to get brain cancer and they're just more concerned about it than white people. Dude, I know somebody that does that though. I know somebody that only talks to using the speakerphone function for some reason. Yeah, but not in public. Outside. They do it. They do it at olive garden. Who is. It has a slight esther does. She's black or at least she likes Black Dick for sure. Why? Why does she do that?

Speaker 4:          00:37:40       Uh, I have no idea. I have no idea. She records every single phone call between her and her parents too because it's fair. Her parents are so ridiculous, but she's just really weird with her phone and phone calls. That's funny man. Sorry about that. I think it's cool. I think it's cool. Do he really just trying to help you out? Yeah, it's a tricky thing man. There's, there was a white girl at the airport who's talking her ass off, like just really fucking loud waiting to get on a plane and it was kind of annoying. It's fucking annoying as shit, man. You can have a normal conversation. Just put that fucking thing up. Do you usually cover? Usually cover my mouth with my hand. I don't want people to, to. This is a big difference between someone sitting there going, hey, yeah, what's up? What's going on?

Speaker 4:          00:38:21       How are you doing? And someone going, Yo, what's up? What's going on? What are you doing? Okay. And then what happens? And then the other person, the other, we're going to come down there, right? I have to listen to your shit, man. This is loud. Maybe she just does it around me now. I'm kind of paranoid that I said because I'm like, wait, does it by herself? Maybe. I don't know if she only does. She does it around me a lot. Maybe it's a security thing where she wants to do like, Hey, I'm talking to this guy. You know what I mean? Yeah. I'm not hiding this around. Yeah. Maybe just being respectful. Yeah. I should start doing it around here. I guess. Just can't be that though. It can't be that because there was no way. We've got a tricky thing in this world about people being too fucking sensitive.

Speaker 4:          00:39:05       There's a lot of to fucking sensitive people that can't take a joke or even take a a conversation. How about this? There's Michelle Obama. Obama's wife is a apparently the center of controversy because she shook a dude's hand. She's in Indonesia and there's a Muslim dude there and they were saying hello, you know, some and some dignitaries, and she shook his hand and it's like all over the news. So retarded. It's all over the news. Oh, I was mad she was being nice to somebody. Oh yeah. The, the Muslims. They're losing their fucking mind. I can't wait. Muslims are losing them. Very upset. I think I pulled it up. But um, anyway, the fucking story is, it's very simple. Here it is. Michelle Obama shakes hands with Indonesian information. Minister. Try saying this dude's name took a darker too fat to some ring as Obama arrived in Jakarta and Indonesia. Apparently conservative Muslim minister and didn't Nisha who is being criticized for shaking hands with Michelle Obama, thus violating his pious claim that he avoids contact with women not related to him as you know, as you're supposed to do. And some sex of Islam. What the fuck man? Two thousand 10. Dude, this is in the news. Some woman's shook a dude's hand. You know what the fuck man. What? He just wanted to touch. Get something that's touched Obama's Dick. You think so? Yeah. He went into connection like a Kevin Bacon connection to Obama's Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:40:32       That is what you get to shake her hand, right? Yeah. You get it off the way. We get it all. You get the whole package. What would we. What if she became president one day? Michelle Obama would be fucking awesome. Kinda of chicken. The aunties black. A black, beautiful, beautiful. If she could be running shit. If she was an exceptional person to run shit, I'd be down. You know the thing about chicks running shit as though they have to be really good at running shit. They can't just be hot. That's the problem with this fucking Sarah Pailin things. All these faggots out there to think that she's good enough to be president because they want to fuck her. I was talking about this on stage. They think that life is like a fucking Kevin Bacon movie where you're the last vote that counts, you know, and then she finds out that you're the one who got her elected presidents and she comes to meet you and an unlikely romance blossom. So now there's a lot of idiots that are willing to vote for Pailin because they really do think she's hot. But I mean, you know, if you can get some genius, brilliant woman to be running shit, I'd be just as Dan. Would that be a dumb bench? No, no. She's never going to become president in Pailin. No. Well, you know what? I wouldn't

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       say never dude, because I would've never believed she would have the following that she has. But everyone knows everyone that has had a tv for the last year and a half, two years have seen every single skit with her. And even if you like her, you have that in the back of your mind. Only you do. You're not retarded dude. Fifty plus percent of this country is almost retarded. There's a giant number of people that are so fucking dump that there could be some other issue. Look, how about this Jan brewer chick? Do you know who she is? She's a woman who was a. She was made governor of Arizona because the original governor left and went to what? What is her name? I forgot what to the Obama campaign. Anyway, the point is this Jan brewer, woman is nuts. She's not an old and can't fucking talk, and she goes on these debates and she paused.

Speaker 5:          00:42:20       She went on to debate. She's debating with this other guy's running for governor. She pause for 10 seconds, said nothing, just a stammering and not knowing what to do and moving your hands and shit. She had a full brain lock. This bitch lied about there being dead bodies on the Mexican border with their heads chopped off, and then everybody went, well, where are the bodies? Like, where's the autopsy reports? Where's the police reports? And it turns out it was all just horseshit. She lied about her fucking father dying in World War II. She said, my father died defending on that. No, she didn't. He didn't die in world war two. He didn't. She made it up. Who died during World War II? We didn't leave. He's still alive. That was the guy was alive. Still alive, still alive in his silence piece of his soul died. Dumb cunt. More likely.

Speaker 5:          00:43:04       Now she's the. She won. And you know why she won? Because she supports this crazy new immigration law. She wants to keep all the Mexicans out of Arizona. Hey, and most of Arizona is white people, most of us owners, crazy old white people. And they're like, no, fuck that Arizona's and nutty place, man. We have a good time there because people like to party and you know, the shows are always fun there and people are always looking for fun stuff too. But if you look at Arizona as a state, like it's kind of a wonky fucking state man. Totally. You're allowed to just have guns there, dude. You can just be walking around with a gun in your pocket. You have to with all the Mexicans, they got guns. Ladies, gentleman, Eddie Bravo is Mexican. So before you start fucking firing up your pen and getting crazy with your hate mail and firing up your twitter,

Speaker 2:          00:43:48       it's totally okay. I could fucking make fun of Burritos. Own. Do you have anybody that you follow it on twitter that you're following? Just because they're dumb that you can talk about? No, not that I can say. Oh well, you know. No. Yeah, you got to be nice, right? Yes. I like, I like ridiculously dumb tweets or funny tweets that inbetween shit. I'm not into like that would just tweet motivational shit that they've heard like, come on now. I'm not for that shit. I love motivational ones. I love like dudes who are like older who give advice like Steve Harvey's my current favorite. Check this shit out as a tweet.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       I save them. I save his tweets. Your relationship with a man is either off or on. It cannot be off and on. Ladies. You have the power stop allowing the back and forth. Damn. He's like a black doctor film. Well first of all, how do you know that? The chickens and just looking to get some Dick, right? Yeah, it's off and on. People are crazy, man. I ain't gonna always work out the trick. He's trying to get bitches. Let's trying to get them to like him. Appear sensitive. Right? So it is totally. Heres another one. Good morning. God will perform the unexpected time and time again. If you just let him talk to God. Don't be too proud to pray.

Speaker 1:          00:45:15       How many followers does he prayed right after? I heard that. How many followers is. Yeah know he's got a lot. Steve Farber was a famous guy. He's good. So 100,000 probably something like that. Now I just hit 200,000 pants. That's something to me. How many a day do you get normally? Like adders few hundred. Few hundred? Yeah. I liked how it continues. Once you get to a certain point, you notice that you get an average of like a certain amount per day. Only have 16,000. I treated like, you know, I, I look uh, treated like a, like a little platform, like a little comedy, Farmville world, you know what I mean? There's a lot of times where I'd get on there and I just promote gigs or a lot of times I find like cool shit, but I found in line like that I'm a Italian song or that American guy or the Italian guy was speaking of seeing an American accent.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       Like what, what it was like jibberish. He wasn't real American words, but what he thought. Can you find that here? This is what I would love to hear that and just someone making fun of an American accent but not really using really interesting. Yeah, it's really interesting. It's kind of a cool song and if you see the video but that like up to eat shit like that or science tweets. I was going to tweet something today, you know, they fired up the large Hadron collider and made thousands of little big bangs there. Started doing that. Man, that's, that's become a, become a reality. They're really doing it now. So they have all these photos at the lab. It's fascinating. Fascinating fucking shit man. You know. But you know, so there's that. I do. And then also like I treat it like a little audience, you know, I think you've got to give people things man, when you, when you're looking to promote gigs and use the internet and shit like this, you know, you can't just promote you gotta you gotta give him some shit too.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       So like the other day I was watching ancient aliens. I spent like a whole hour just tweeting, talking shit on h and aliens that gather new season. So bad. Well, the first season was incredible. The first season is awesome. They ran out of. They're trying to, you know, it was, it was crazy. All the shit that we're saying, but if you look at it this way, if you're, if you don't believe in Ufos, then that sounds ridiculous. But if you do believe, if you watched the disclosure project and you listen to all the courses, testimony, the guy who used to work for the. We used to be in the Pentagon and fucking head of nuclear energy in Europe and all that shit when, when you hear his confessions and like, like the deathbed confession of General Ramy

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       and, and just if you, if you, if you believe in Ufos than fucking anything as possible, then that means they must have been here several times at least. And if there were around during the Greek time, they must have tripped out on them. That must've been a big news like these motherfuckers. And they must have like talked to drew about, uh, uh, you know, uh, painted about it, talked about it, wrote some scripture about or something. And it's not that far fetched, but that come into some like ridiculous conclusions like about, like the paintings in India that maybe this was an alien, will the Mahabharata the, that's a fascinating text. The ancient texts of ancient hinduism is a, is riddled with stories of, of flying things and, and you know, things that flew through the air. But you also have to realize that these people took a lot of drugs.

Speaker 5:          00:48:22       These people were in the heavy psychedelic drugs. I mean Mana to the ancient Hindu tax. They believe it's some sort of a combination of psilocybin mushrooms and a bunch of other different things. There's a bunch of debate about what Mana is, but it's very clear that they were referencing something that connected them to the psychedelic world. And if it was something that connected them to the psychedelic world, you know, and I know you're going to see some shit. It doesn't mean that the shit you're seeing is not real. You know, when you see the, like when people think of hallucinations, like you think of, oh you took a drug and you saw a monkey that wasn't really there and he, you know, you know, you think of something fake, but what you see a lot of times when you take psychedelics drugs is not like the rest of the world.

Speaker 5:          00:49:05       And then all of a sudden some new fake thing shows up. It shows you like a whole new world. It shows you like a whole hallucination world which may or may not be real. You know, what, what, what might be happening when you take like big doses of any crazy drug as you might be tuning into the next door neighbor channel. You know, there might be the whole world, might be a fucking radio, have a million different channels and we might be on, you know, 1:06 point four. And there's a 100, six point five and it's right next door. And when you take mushrooms you go there. You know. So you know, these guys saying that they saw these flying things and talking about all these majestic beings with all this wisdom that very easily could have been drugs very easily. It could be. That could, it could be both.

Speaker 5:          00:49:49       I mean just because you have a psychedelic experience doesn't mean that. I mean that very, very. I don't know how much I believe very skeptical about crafts from another planet that come here that are metal and the traditional idea of like, you know, just doing a super advanced version of what we already do. I look at that and I go, I don't think so. This just seems too silly. It seems to. Mechanic testimony did. Yeah. But it doesn't matter. It's a lot of testimony. People being raped by demons. You can go back in time and find thousands of Napa who. But it's not your size. Yeah. But these people which try and keep on organizing and getting in front of the Washington DC and the national press and they don't have credible witness like hundreds of them and Philip course. So on all these guys that like in their death bed, like you watched the testimonies like, do you think these guys are lying?

Speaker 5:          00:50:41       That's true. But it doesn't necessarily mean that they are telling the truth. It might mean they're wrong. It might mean that there's some crazy government experiments that they don't. They're not really sure. I believe in that. I believe there's definitely a lot of this shit. Maybe most of the shit that people see and report our, our own government make and shape. But if you listen to Philip Corso testimony, he's saying yes. A lot of that shit is our shit to say that he saw things himself personally. Yes, he did. Phil, of course. So was this part of Roswell right? He wasn't at Roswell, but he was involved in the shipping and stuff. He said he saw the bodies. He said that he was intrinsically saw them or saw them. He saw that. He said he opened the coffin song and said, Oh shit. And He. He knew so much that he was in charge of taking crashed Ufo shit and taking it to, this is what he said, taking it to like Hughes aircraft and Mcdonald Douglas getting reverse engineer.

Speaker 5:          00:51:36       Fascinating story about Roswell and everybody thinks at Roswell's a silly stupid story and no one knows exactly what happened. It could have been some sort of a Soviet craft that crashed, but the fascinating part is that they flew the wreckage and two separate planes because they wanted to make sure of one plane crash. They had a good chance that the other plane would make it to Wright Patterson air force base and they made sure they separated the wreckage. There's just so much evidence. Even like today with like the chain, the China Shanghai airport or an airport in China closed down twice within a few months because there were some shit right over the airport. They didn't know what it was. They shut everything down. I mean just shit like that all over the world. I mean there's. So there's actually is evidence. I mean people are put away for life with no video, no pictures of the crime.

Speaker 5:          00:52:23       Just testimony, man, they're just listening to that testimony and putting people away for multiple life sentences. When you put all the evidence together, just look up Phillip Corso with the sea. What? There's hours and hours of him just talking about. He wrote a book about it before he was. He was an old motherfucker. He was on dateline and shit. I think an even more compelling one is Dr j Dot Allen Hynek exactly. Was Working on project Blue Book and he was assigned to discredit ufo stories. He what his job was as he explained it was when he would hear about something, he would come up with a reason that it was something else. Swamp, swamp gas or circular ball, lightning. All this different. She was hired for that by the government like in the fifties and sixties. And then when project blue book shut down, he dedicated his entire life to investigating you, fos and enlightening people on it. Totally. And he talks about it. I mean there's interviews, he's like ours and then there's like a new theory. Now the new theory is that the government wants everyone to believe in Ufos.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       To keep their projects under wrap, like they're black projects under wrap. I'm like, what? What is, what was this project blue book and all this stuff or whatever saying that it was swamp gas number. Trying to calm everybody down. Why were they lying? I mean they would have just said, yeah, you know what? We don't know what it is. It's probably from another galaxy, but we don't know, but what we assure you we're going to do whatever it takes to protect you. If they really wanted people to believe in the, they'd be saying that shit not cover it up. So I mean if you look up, look at the Phillip Corso testimony. Look at the disclosure project. There's already been at least two of them. I mean these, there's so much credible and like, like the top scientists of Europe all got together. I forget what the committee is called.

Speaker 2:          00:54:08       International Group was. They came together in France and they looked at all the Ufo testimony and all the shit and they said 15 percent. It's probably beans from another galaxy or another solar system. That's what they said. All of them could have been explained away, but the 15 percent they said, this is probably, I would not conclude that it was something from this earth that we haven't discovered yet. They, especially when you look at the ocean, well this is what they concluded. They concluded that all the other ship, 85 percent of all the shit that like that could be me, that could be manmade, that could be this. This is probably some reflection off the sun. Fifteen percent. They said the most likely because based on the pictures and the way that they got some shit from satellite pictures of craft coming from the top down that they couldn't explain it and they're like, man, what the fuck are moving?

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       You know that weird shit of things moving and then changing angles and changing direction and moving another way. The big, the bigger incident that happened at the US military installation in the UK where there's an 80 motherfuckers that saw this aircraft, three of them came up to it as it was parked. They touched it. They took notes that are on the disclosure possibility. Three of them went up to it and 80 of them were all around going, Holy Shit. That's possible that it was a drone. That's possible, that it was something from America. When they set it to God disappeared. It was gone. When I said, if you have a drone, I mean, especially if we're talking about different alternative sources of power, we don't know none of those. None of those motherfuckers and and it came back. They sent a guy to look into it and that guy's in the disclosure project to like two days later they sent the guy to calm everyone down and they came back and they saw it and these guys are the and the. When the military, the UK embassy, The d, the Ministry of Defense, they're there. When the. They came up to them and ask them, what are we going to do about this? What was that? They go, this doesn't. If it doesn't concern national security, we're not getting involved. That doesn't sucker and we feel that it doesn't, it doesn't. But here's the problem with this whole story. Okay? You weren't there. I wasn't there. We're just talking about what we heard people talking about. We don't

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       know exactly what went down and until you talk to these people, you don't know how many of them are full of shit. How many of them are exaggerating, how many of them were traumatized? That's why I say based on the shit that you see, if you actually look into it and then you make the judgment, you're making the judgment. Damn. You know, if you haven't seen the testimony, then yeah, you don't. We don't know what what he said or it doesn't. It doesn't matter. It's all on testimony. When you're basing on the testimony, you don't know anything about these people. You never know how much of it you're getting square with 80 and this is what they said to. They said the response to the British Ministry of Defense saying, if it doesn't, if it doesn't concern national security, we're not going to get involved. Then 80, 80 people fucking hallucinated that and then it got 80 people, 80 people that are full of shit.

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       They got 80 bit needed as neither it means neither. That's not true. If it means that 80 people were not aware of what they were looking at, that's all it means. If they're trained to observe them, they're in the military, doesn't mean anything. If the military people that are in the know, the people that are there at the scene of the crime or the senior landing, if they're not aware of the technology that's available to the highest levels of government, they're not aware of whatever experimental shit they're working on. It might as well be from another planet, so what are they going to say if they don't know about horse? Of course nobody knows. Nobody was there, but to make a judgment based on the testimony, you can totally not believe in God. You know what? I don't believe these guys. Or You could look at it and say, I'm going to look at what the open mind fuck 80 dudes that are trained observers.

Speaker 5:          00:57:54       Three went up to it and touched it. They sat there saying, it's out of this fucking world. Definitely they're saying it. That's what they're in the military. The British Ministry of Defense is fucking not even looking into it at all. I mean to the conclusion are you, but it's still a bunch of people's testimonies about something they saw and then you might not have known what they were seeing and then you add all the shit around. That's just one incident. Then you look at all of it, you connect all the dots and you, you know, you can make a decision. And my decision, Mike, is that there's some shit going on. That's how I feel based on our decision is not that at all. My decision as is as there's a lot of people with a lot of stories and we know for a fact that there are a fuck load of experimental government aircrafts that they use for sure they're manned or whether they're remote control and you know, all these people are just telling their version of a story.

Speaker 5:          00:58:48       Something that they saw. I believe they saw something I do not believe that they know is from another world. So them even saying it was from another world. People want shit to be romantic. They want shit to be little gray man to come here and spaceships from palladium is wherever the fuck they are coming from the galaxy. They want that. They look for that shit. Fall in love and that's all true what you're saying, but you don't believe that there's Ufo. What is this believe, man? You either believe me. Don't believe that's not true. Absolutely not true. That is not true. We do not have to believe you're right in the middle real or something's not real. You just go. I don't know because that's the only rational explanation. Yeah, but you can't say you believe because when you believe it, throw everything else out the out the door.

Speaker 5:          00:59:28       You said, well, this is the. I believe there are Ufos. I believe that aliens have landed here. I don't believe that. I don't believe we. No, I don't believe that. We're absolutely convinced and I don't believe that you believe. Can you believe that Philip Corso was a crazy man and it was full of Shit. What do you do as adding words? So what I'm saying, 12 year old ship based on. Based on what you saw from Phillip Course leave, he's out there sucking cock and take it in the ass and he's doing drugs and he didn't even know what he was saying. How about that? Is that better? I'm just trying to get courses. Just a guy man. I mean he's a guy that said he saw some bodies and he's a guy that used to work for the military. Is he credible? The Pentagon? He was head of head of nuclear energy in Europe.

Speaker 5:          01:00:06       Okay. George Bush was the president and he's an idiot. Does it matter? Does it matter? Like how high he got up there? It's very clear to me that the entire government is riddled with fucking idiots. There's idiots all over the place. It. Was He an idiot? I don't think so. He seemed like an interesting guy. Did he see some shit? I don't know. What did he see in those with those bodies? What were they? Who the fuck knows? They might've been mutants. They might've been fucking radiation disasters. They might've been a little children that had a disease. I don't know. I don't know how much you saw it. I don't know how close he got to it. I don't know how much information he was really truly pretty think Oj guilty.

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       I don't know if Oj guilty, I assuming. Yes. There's a lot of evidence to dead people, knives, blood in his car. It's a little different than some dude who says he saw a Ufo and doesn't know what it is, so why did they let him free? What the fuck are we talking about? Oj format. Let's. That's we're talking about evidence and testimony and all that stuff. That's what we're talking about. A system is fucked up. That's why because black people thought that it was one on their side that they were going to release him and if it did not fit, you must acquit and they wanted to get back at the Rodney King verdict and so they released them. That's why was not a Ufo ufs. You guys have like a, like a couple that broke up and have come together. Careful. You have to be careful when you start talking about things that you haven't seen yourself.

Speaker 5:          01:01:23       This is just my opinion when the same way with you, I. I don't even if it was the most evidence ever, unless I knew for a fact I saw with my own eyes. I just too much bullshit. I don't follow anything. Why stress out about it? It's there's too much bullshit. There's 20 people are full of Shit. Too many people exaggerate too many people twist the truth and there's a big business and talking about Ufos and that's another thing to be careful of. There's a gigantic business and writing books about this shit and doing lectures and seminars and these guys make a fucking good living. Traveling the country, selling books and talking about Ufos. Whenever you involve commerce in a very strange discussion, like the discussion of the potential reality of our intelligent life from other planets. Whenever you involve money in that and money and then in the stories.

Speaker 5:          01:02:10       I mean, then it becomes sort of a faction of show business. I mean Whitley strieber is one of the fucking biggest proponents of the alien abduction story and wrote books on it, communion and had movies made about it and that guy is a fucking book writer. He writes books. He makes fiction. He makes fiction and he created this whole thing about getting abducted by UFOS and everybody took it as fact and man, who the fuck knows of it's fact. You got a guy who's a professional fiction man and you don't know. You don't know what's going on in his head. In his head. There's no evidence. It's like it's like there may be Ufo is. Absolutely. There may be. There may be intelligent life from other plants. Absolutely. There may be, but you can't just jump on. Yes. Because you jump on. Yes. What did I just jumped on?

Speaker 5:          01:02:56       Jumped on. It did. I didn't jump on it. It's just so much research. I fucking. I'm obsessed with you. I do a lot. I didn't just jump on it. I listened to a lot of tests. You said you jumped at, but I didn't just jump on it like you're making it seem like you were like, I heard one testimony and that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying you look, if you listen to what I said, what I said was that you, unless you experiencing it yourself, you don't know exactly what happened. When you talking about people that are talking about crafts that they think were from another world, you don't know where it really came from and that gets very, very tricky and if you choose to believe or not to believe you're jumping on one side or another, if you're saying, I don't think there's [inaudible], I think everyone's full of shit.

Speaker 5:          01:03:35       You're sick, you're jumping on. No, and if you say, I do believe, I believe you're here. You're jumping on. Yes. Even if there's a lot of what you think is evidence, unless you're seeing it yourself, unless it has been proven, which clearly hasn't. It's clearly up for debate. Even though there's a bunch of people that come forward, whether there's 100 or a thousand and they say, I have crazy stories about things that move too fast. Who the fuck knows what that is? Who knows? Okay. You don't believe in your phones. Wow. Wow. Dude, are you. Are you kidding? You're kidding. You're kidding, right? I'm not kidding. That's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying that I don't believe in your fault what I'm saying. You don't know why no one knows nothing else. No Man. No, no, no. That's what I'm saying. Believe when you believe something, it's like you know, for like based on the evidence, I believe there's some shit going on with other galaxies, so that's what I believe possible.

Speaker 5:          01:04:28       That there's life on other planets. It's certainly possible. It's also possible that life is a dream. It's also possible that your life is imagination and you've made it all up and I'm a figment of your imagination and each player is in your life to provide you with some information and try to help you and move you along in a certain way. It's very possible that this life is not even real. It's very possible that I'm in your imagination in urine mine and we sell create because a lot of different possibilities that's possible, but whether or not there's Ufo because some people that you don't know who you've never met saw some things that you never saw and said. They wrote it down and had conferences and discussions about. I don't know. I don't know about that.

Speaker 5:          01:05:08       Do you guys like sweet potato fries? It's just, it's a tricky thing, man. It's we attach ourselves to what we believe in and you obviously are getting attached to this idea of being real because you've spent so much time invested, so much time being fascinated by it, fascinated with. I'm fascinated with the testimony and putting it all together. You're making it sound like. I'm like, like mystic law. I'm not man. I'm not making a song that I am saying exactly what you're saying, but what I am fascinated by people and I know that people are full of shit and I'm not assuming that all these people are pious. I'm not assuming that all these people are completely honest and without ulterior motive and telling you exactly know as they saw it. The truth. I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing a bunch of believers and that's the problem.

Speaker 5:          01:05:58       Even if you saw something fucking completely insane, I don't want you telling me you know what it is. I don't want you describing it that way. I want you saying I don't know what it was. I want you to say, I think, you know, it could've been some sort of a craft that I'm not aware of. It could be a Ufo means man and identified flying objects. You know, you're not saying you, you're saying aliens, right? Yes. Well, I'm not saying aliens. I'm saying unknown. And when someone says they know and they start talking about it being from another planet, bitch, do you have like some fucking serial numbers you can track back to this planet? Like how do you know where it came from? You don't know shit. They're just taking a guess. They see something in the sky. I can't build. It must be from space.

Speaker 5:          01:06:39       I mean it's that simple. It's not that simple. Like I go through that stuff. It is that simple. If you want to claim, you know where it came from, man. Okay. He can't. No, you can't. No, no one's saying they know. If you don't know, if you haven't seen it, you don't know where it came from. You haven't watched the video of it fucking flying off that planet and landing here. Then it's digital. A lot of fucking guesswork. It's a romantic idea. The idea seems so cool. The idea that there's fucking alien. It's tricky because you get sucked into it. Like it seems so awesome. So does the loch ness monster, you know, it's like we have this built in shit in our head. It's nothing like the monster van lochness monster is like bigfoot. Not bigfoot is a real animal. You know, they have isolated in an animal called gigantic [inaudible] that they believe if human beings came down to the bering strait and they came from Asia, gigantic [inaudible] lived in Asia as recently as 10,000 years ago.

Speaker 5:          01:07:34       It was a bipedal primate that was eight to 10 feet tall. So I believe in bigfoot. It's an animal. It was whether or not believe people see it. What do the fuck knows, man? There was wooly mammoths and Saber Tooth Tigers here 10,000 years ago, seven foot tall, giant fucking birds like a few hundred thousand years ago. There was animals on this planet, in this continent that don't exist anymore, that were pretty fucking crazy. Craziest. Saber tooth tigers are crazier than bigfoot. Bigfoot's. Just another big monkey. If big foot was gigantic because it's just another large primate that went extinct, whereas big foot supposed to be living Pacific northwest, which is if you follow the the traveling down the bering strait, which is where Indians came here. American Indians

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       originated in Siberia and Asia and they came down from there. America, what people don't realize is 10,000 years ago, half of America was under a mile high sheet of ice. This was covered in ice. It's like a barren land, but something dramatic happened to the environment of the earth and the ice age. When it ended, the America opened up and that's when people started moving here. When people, some of the people had already moved here. There was, there was. They found Chinese bodies here from 10,000 years ago, but when, when people started moving here, they came from there. They came from the Bering Strait. That's like the number one theory of a big percentage of the American Indians. So they came down from Asia and this monkey lived in Asia and if this thing followed them with the fuck knows, is there any compelling evidence for Loch Ness Monster? There's pictures, there's their scans from radar, they think it could be a big fish that could have got landlocked that was extinct in other places, but not there.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       The problem with Loch ness is it's really murky. They can't see and it could be a bunch of other things. Could be a bunch of other things that people are misconstruing and there's been a bunch of hoaxes, but when, when enough people have seen things, you've got to wonder, well, what the fuck? Is it an eel? Is it when you got to think of all the animals that are real, you know, is it a adult in Moseley floating wood and just people knowing the story and going, oh, there it is. There's more evidence for big foot or loch ness monster. Probably bigfoot because bigfoot, there's the American Indians. That's a big, big part of the lure of big foot. There's over 250 American Indian names for big foot. Big Foot was born in the imagination of an American Indian that just might've made that mention. It might've been 20 big foot was born in the head of an American Indian.

Speaker 1:          01:09:58       That was just winning at attention. You imagine one dude came up with that and spread it happened in every. All the other ones that somebody hearing that same story and just being paranoid walking through the woods later. It's like other tribes, other tribes with like these fucking costumes, like bear costume was the most compelling evidence about. Big Foot is actually the audio tapes. There's these audio tapes of these crazy primate howls that they've recorded in the Pacific northwest and they're really fucking loud. They're really loud and interesting and these have been done, you know, and and supposedly by legit scientists that have recorded these sounds. So it could be somebody let a monkey loose. They had a crazy pet monkey and they let that motherfucker lose and he's screaming in the woods. We put you in the woods. You could make up some sounds that they would think of as big foot in lochness announcements.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       Baby. What's the worst? The conspiracy to like the worst one? Flat Earth. There's people that flat to the young earth. That's another bad one. No, no, no, no. Like today, people don't believe that young earth. They believe the young earth. Yeah, that's a big percentage of the Christian population. There's a guy on twitter, I follow them all the time. He's just crazy retarded. Uh, a Christian young Earth Guy who's always talking about the evidence against evolution. Yes. These youtube videos just, just, you can't watch them for more than five minutes because the insanity radiates off the screen and it starts to get you blond hair. Cute Lips was really nice. They, they believed that the earth is less than 10,000 years old. A lot of people, more than 50 percent during a recent Gallup poll in the United States believe that the earth, the earth is the age that is depicted in the Bible, which is less than 10,000 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       They probably don't even know what that is. I was going to the Bible say that. Yeah, it's the Bible probably. What does, what does Jesus thing? Yeah. That's all they have to hear. There's a lot of dumb ass conspiracy theories. Big Foot's not the dumbest one. Big Foot. There's, there's, there's a real animal that they can lock that too. It's like if there's one, the Jersey Devil, some fucking giant monster, that's like half the one God, but I to Texas one. Well the two Chupacabra, they've narrowed that down to. They think it's mange mange on coyotes because they've had dead coyotes that they've shot and killed that were covered in mange. Do they don't even look real. They look like Zombie Coyote looked like ghouls. They lose all their hair. It's an. It's a common disease and they have photos. There's photos of him online. If you look Chupa Cobra, they have a headless when they chopped its head off and it's a coyote to coyote that horrible mange and it has like almost blue dark bluish, blackish skin and no hair and it looks like a monster.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       So that's most likely the origin of the tube macabre because you're talking about something that killed goats and shit and killed chickens. That's what coyotes do. You know. So they, they have that narrowed down. You know, I was at the zoo this weekend, man and I saw a leopard. They had a leopard there and that it was so sad that just pacing around just doesn't get to jack anything. Just pacing. Look at all these people staring down. Well, they've started to find leopards in America. Brown. Really? That prints have made their way to Phoenix? Yeah, there's leopard sightings in Arizona. Wow, that's awesome. And now they're coming up through South America and through Mexico and into America leopards pro. That's pretty good. Leopards are no joke. Could you imagine if you were the first American to get jacked by a leopard? Love it. What'd you check? There'll be leopard hunting season and those motherfuckers will be wiped out.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       Do you think so man, tried to go into Texas in Texas. They don't even have to open up a hunting season in Texas. They'll just start shooting them. The kids will shoot him. Who were we talking about the other day? That was jogging and they shot something and they had a newer, more amazed that they had a gun while they're jogging. Somebody was telling us this story and what the fuck told us that. What was that shit? That sucks. I thought, nevermind. Didn't they do that in Colorado when we lived there to jog with? You have to have a gun, right? I carried a gun. Yeah, I did. They have. They have like jogging holsters. You carried a gun. Every time I went hiking. Right. Fuck you. You fucking rifle behind you. The last thing you want to do is be out there by yourself with your family in a fucking Predator attacks. You don't have a gun. Especially when it's somebody that wants your daughters. It's so easy to shoot things. You know Kevin Gone. You put it in your pocket.

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       I mean that's pretty crazy. Technology. You have this little thing in your pocket that can protect you. You know? What are the. What are the odds of that? You got to use that shit.

Speaker 3:          01:14:19       I haven't been thinking really hard about getting a gun lately. Let me and like there's two of my friends that were both saying like they just called me randomly, like, Hey, do you wanna get a gun? I think it was Duncan or somebody added a habit and not to need it.

Speaker 5:          01:14:30       Needed not to have it. You can't control all these people and this world living out in the wilderness like you did. We talked about this before. It's a lot like you know, no matter where you go, you got to deal with some death. Either you live in the city and you've got to deal with muggers and rapists or like gang bangers or something. All you live way out away from that shit. No Gang bangers are going out into the wilderness, but then you've got to do with mountain lions and shit like that to deal with things and you gotta deal with weird people. At least you can shoot them and you're cool. Like you could just look at them and go Bam and just blast them. You can't do that top bugger until he jumps on. You got to be careful with bears because bears are hard to kill.

Speaker 5:          01:15:09       It's very hard to kill a bear with a pistol. If you've got a bear, you're better off shooting. And what about bear Mace works? Yeah. You got to get them with it though. They've got to be close enough for you to get on with it. I didn't even know bear mace existed until South Park when I got to be careful. Oh, was he? He thought it was the bounty hunter that was in the South Park is based on evergreen. That's where those guys grew up. That's where I almost left. I want to live in the mountains of boulder, but the mountains above Denver, there's one town called evergreen that I really liked and that's where a south park is. That's what it's based on actually from Denver.

Speaker 3:          01:15:40       Those dudes. Yeah. That's anybody want a drink? Coconut water, coconut one. Have you had these coconut waters? I fuck, yeah. We need to be sponsored Brighton so they can send us crates of them. So if you're listening. Oh, what is it? C T S C two o. that's coconut water in the rural. Better than that. It takes brain box one. Oh, totally. What it tastes like. It tastes like you just ate a bowl of fruit loops and it's the milk from the fruit loops. Oh sure. You know, that's what it tastes like. Shit, I'm a big fan on this stuff. Yeah. I living in Colorado is just as tricky as well. Cheers. Salute. Here's the. Because there's gotta be a coconut water alcoholic beverage, right. There has to be my go to a bar and say, get me in. I bought Seagram's for my dad's birthday.

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       I bought him a crate of the shit that you always drink with the mushrooms and stuff. What's that called? Oh, Kombucha created that in a creative coconut water. He loves the Kabuki, but the coconut water he doesn't like, but he uses it for a Pina coladas. He doesn't like this stuff now. He says it's weak. He says he needs to add something to it. I think when you get old you lose your taste, but vodka, coconut water will probably this shit. When you get older, you lose your taste buds. Yeah. He started losing taste. One of older people are more likely to eat. Ask them, yes. You would think that, fuck no, I would. After all the shits, they had an

Speaker 5:          01:17:02       the smelling and I remember that video we watched a long time ago about rods to remember that shit so serious fucking

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       video that this dude was in Mexico filming all these people. Yeah, filling these people will sky diving into this cliff. There's a cliff that's like a mile down. It's crazy. It looks like someone took a an apple core to the earth and cut this gigantic hole out of the earth and these dudes would base jump off that bitch and skydive and fucking pull parachute will. As they're filming a. You see these things flying by the camera like insane speed and they looked like tubes. They look like they're like wing tubes and this guy dedicated his whole life to fucking tracking these things down and trying to find out what the fuck these things were. The remodels turns out it was just an artifact. It was a video camera artifact that when something moved too quickly, too close to the screen, it stretched the image out. So it made the imagery was a flying snake.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       Absolutely. So this poor fuck literally made videos, has websites. Roswell Rod, is he still on it? He had a. He had given up. Let's go to Roswell. Rovs.com. So you just fucking dummy. This is the problem man. And this guy's making created guys making money doesn't mean you have those aren't real dude. Just because that guy fucked up. No, it doesn't mean it's not real, but it doesn't mean they're not real, but it doesn't mean they are. It's like you put, like you said, it's most likely I will say that I'll, I'll take back. I believe and I say it's most likely real. Gotten better. Is that better? Why? Why even have a fucking. This is about opinions. Like what are, you know, you can't just pay, just can't just speak to why. Why? Why become attached. I'm just saying, based on what I've seen, it's most likely will take.

Speaker 1:          01:18:46       Decides down. Fuck. Kevin Kelly took. He was videotaping mob. It says this is the official website for the mysterious frying entities called rods discovered by Jose escamia over at midway and jogger or something, wasn't it? It's just a light jog or he's just a dummy, a dummy. They got tricked by some shit, you know, I mean, these guys on monster quest figured it out and fucking 10 minutes. This guy has been trying to, hey kid dot five, roswell rods that come, you're done son. This, it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist anymore. This guy fucking spent his whole life. Do. There needs to be a documentary on his shit because you know, he tape everything, right? They need to get that footage and then get the footage of him. Now he's probably penniless and insane somewhere. I wonder how many emails he gets by mistake. Like I heard you videotape a lot of rides. He actually had another one that he was gay rights, Gay Roz warrant. There was another one that he, uh, was, was chasing down another crazy thing that didn't seem to make any sense. Let me, let me type his name because he had like another thing that was like another theory about something else. And then someone on the message board going, wait a minute. Isn't that the rods guy? And that's who he is from now on.

Speaker 6:          01:20:01       I, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:20:04       oh, lunar rising. Oh, here he goes. He's got some shit about the moon. Yeah, he thinks there's fucking anomalies on the moon now. Oh, okay. Here we go. It's the true color of the moon. For over 50 years, we have been told and convinced the moon is nothing more than a black and white desolate rock with moon dust and craters that thousands of photos released to the public have always presented a black and white moon. Even with the most recent Hubble photographs of the moon are black and white. NASA continues to perpetuate the lie that in quotes that the moon is black and white with this mother fucker is crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:20:39       He's like, tammy switched over, switched over

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       bunch of spots that he says, oh my God, this is hilarious. Is they believe that the moon landing was a hoax. Oh knows he's. What he's showing is craters and he believes that these craters are different alien artifacts and these craters like, oh, there's such a stretch. Like the photos are such a stretch is thinks that these structures are artificial. It's like fucking craters, man. Shit got smashed by rocks from space. You know, sometimes a little shapes come out of that. You fucking dummy.

Speaker 3:          01:21:12       Did you say the moon on Conan set last night on his first episode. How was the first episode? Did you watch it? Yeah, it felt really cheap, like you know, how you watch the NBC show. It felt like the furniture was high quality if felt like those were real plants behind them. It felt like a good backdrop. This felt like they got everything at fucking sears outlet, you know, and, and, and in the background was this horrible blue painting that just looked really cheap and generic. And then there was this moon in the middle of it that was kind of cool and I guess it moves, it moves, but it just looked like the whole thing look like low budget and it wasn't the real moon or fake fake man or, but it just look really low budget and I don't know, I was okay. He had seth rogen on left side and listen how gay you are you looking at the set of control as a fan?

Speaker 3:          01:22:02       I was a fan of the show. I was a role. Was it a real moon or fake news? I couldn't comment on the furniture. It was a real fan of the show in a lot of the reviewers of that, you know, like newspapers and stuff that reviewed, reviewed it, you know, they made up an interesting point. It's like, why are you focusing on a 10th of a variation of the tonight show? You know, that you're not being your own show. You're being like the tonight show in a version of the tonight show. You have this new opportunity. Why don't you fucking throw that desk out a window and fucking do something. You know, people like that desk. Isn't that funny that you liked having people on it? Isn't it better to do it like this way? Just like this is like if we were here or.

Speaker 3:          01:22:42       I mean we have a table so we have our laptops and shit in front of us, but I do have kind of a desto yeah. But that's to put shit on that. They don't see. They don't see the dose. There's always a pencil and a piece of paper now. Yeah. But our viewers don't see the deaths. Well, I mean he. I guess it's cool that he has notes and everything. What they could put that on a teleprompter. I think there's some security to the desk because it's been there forever. Just because you get boners when Pamela Anderson from years ago was on.

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't look cool. You get nervous when you're seeing Pamela. I'm gonna let you sit there on stage. No desk and they're on a big lazy boy. Just got a headset on and you don't want to be too lazy though. Just in the conversation will be interesting.

Speaker 3:          01:23:25       Conan. Just have a cool house and invite some cool people over, you know, and just eating out. That's actually now get some good cameras. Had some good behind it, but just have Conan with his little beard going, hey, check out. Check out my garage just hanging out in the garage and talk about your movie.

Speaker 1:          01:23:40       No, the problem is that a lot of people like to be in the audience and elect to have an audience there. It plate makes the comedy place. Two hundred people are sad and my people via skype. That's cool. All right. That'll work, man. You know John Heffrons doin like comedy shows through skype, something like skype. It's a new form of video conferencing technology, but he sits in a room and there's all these screens around him and he's like performing for all these other people that are in the room with them. It's pretty cool. Shit. It's actually two credible. I hope that catches them not in front of an audience. Know he's doing some corporate gigs where he does them on a desk and the desk. There's like, there's. There's cameras at Com. Adam, can you hear laughter, your everything. They're all connected. Everyone's conference called up and it's like, you know, 5,100.

Speaker 1:          01:24:24       Hold on. They're crazy. I mean he's sitting there by himself in front of a laptop and then that could be fucking the whole world listening and then you could hear all their laughter. Can you imagine the shower? Correct. You have a stereo system and as well he said it's really crazy because you could see when you set it up you can see all these people in front of you, like you see them sitting like there's not just one screen. It was like a dozen screens in front of him and he sees all these people in front of them. So it's almost like an audience. Whoa. At the shower ring convention. Yeah man. I'm not real interested in talk shows. You know, like when I'd heard about it I was like, you know, I'm not going to really watch it like a podcast, but it's not because it's seven minutes and all they're doing is talking about their moves. They're talking about there. I mean, how often does someone have a really interesting story? It's not usually. Most of the time they just pimping their shit, you know? They'll have a little, you know, so what's been going on? We recently had our second baby.

Speaker 3:          01:25:18       To me it's good because you lay in bed and you're kind of like watching the news kind of like, it's like the news but mixed with humor right now. So it's kind of more just like, it's like I wouldn't watch it if it was like 8:00 PM.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       Right. I mean, I like them. I mean they're okay, but I don't go out of my way to see him. I prefer, I prefer the Jon Stewart show. Honestly. I think that the daily show, the way he does it is the best way. He has a lot of shit that he fucks around with like his, his monologues and his megan front of things in the news. Even though it's all political for the most part. He, I think he hit the mark more than anybody. He makes me laugh out loud more than anybody. You guys already talk about the Golfer granicus weed smoking incident on the Jon Stewart show? No. Didn't know what happened. Yeah. Yeah. He smoked pot. He pulled out a giant. Was actually

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       the bill Maher show was a dumpster? No. Okay. It was real time. But you know, the executive said that it wasn't real pot. That was a prop they had to say. Yeah. But why do they have to say? Why do they have to say it's not real? Who the kids were, this is the first podcast we've done since proposition nine did not pass 19 rather did not pass, you know, and so there's a lot of fucking tears, a lot of shit going on right now in this country. There's a lot of shit going on with pot and disinformation and people thinking that somehow or another, if you don't have pot and it's more accessible than it is now, that the world's going to fall apart. It's sad. I never thought when I was a little kid that we'd be here and now 2010 and this would still be up for debate.

Speaker 4:          01:26:51       Yeah. But you also know that it's never going to pay. It's not going to pass that easily and the, unless it's like an iphone app, one single button, all these people instead of having to register and then go get fucking take off work or go towards your lunch and we do that. Otherwise would be too much fraud. Yeah. But you know, in 10 years they're going to figure it out. It's going to be on your fucking pagers maybe. But maybe there's probably some incentive to keep it complicated because the more complicated, absolutely less people vote and the more it's political aficionados that are in the mix instead of just the casual person. I knew that was going to happen now. Did you? I wasn't shocked at all. It was just like gay marriage, you know, you thought that was gonna pass. But then you know what's shocking to me, man, when the polls are right?

Speaker 4:          01:27:33       Because I'm like, how are they, you know who fuck answers polls, you know? Do you ever answered a poll? Like online? Yeah. Or if somebody called you up and you talk to them or. Yeah. Yeah. All the time. I do pose to you like if you're on TMZ and it's like, that is Mel Gibson's butt look fat? Yes or no? I'm going to take the extra click the c note just to see what the answers are. No, we don't. You know, first of all, those aren't real polls, but I made a poll is like you go somewhere and it's a multiple page thing. We're asking a bunch of questions that much. Even a few questions. 10 questions sometimes like you know, like once in a while, like if a product that I really like that you get that spam email with, like please answer 10 questions for us. Do you agree? If it's a company I like I'll give them. I'll take the extra minute. Brian, why not? I don't know. Anything that I could do to help the products that like, you know, like if it's like whatever apple, you do do that. Like you, you like make little videos and shit when you like a product. Yeah. The only, the last poll I took was like who's the best submission artists in mma?

Speaker 4:          01:28:38       Bj Penn. Oh, and mma. Marcel is nOt really an mma right anymore because he'd done though probably. Yeah. He's making so much money in jujitsu. He doesn't need to go through all that shit. He's making a teaching. Yeah dude, his website man. God daMn. He charges 30 bucks a Month to get his techniques. Thirty. YeAh. That's a lot

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       of fucking extra thousands a Month. That dude who um, set it up that chessmaster joe, josh, I think his last name is waitzkin. I don't remember exactly how to pronounce his name. Bobby fischer. He's the one from that video searching for Bobby Fischer, the movie. It was all based on him and he was a child chess prodigy and now he's transferred that into becoming a jujitsu guy. He loves jujitsu and he treats treated just like chess or as a bunch of openings, a bunch of different counters and have some broken down so he has the website really like systematically organized the way you would organize like chest practice. So it's pretty fucking interesting. And someone who's a chess genius. I mean that kind of a mind, that kind of a like, you know, like retarded, the word strategic that, that kind of a strategic mindset apply to jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          01:29:52       It's kind of interesting. I bet. I mean if you were making free money just like 20 k a month, which is probably in the area doing nothing, why would you do? I'm in my money does flow in the fucking. He doesn't want to do it, you know what I mean? He doesn't need to. You can just stick to being the greatest jujitsu player of all time. Well, I would love to see just professional jujitsu because I've always said that, you know, one of the best things about jujitsu, Washington u two is you don't have any guilt even though you're watching dudes get jacked and even if you jacker guy, there's no guilt. It's because like when you knock somebody out or you hurt somebody or even watched someone get knocked out, at least part of my brain is like, that guy just got fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:30:29       You know, there's a part of that god is not going to be the same again. And like he got hit by a car when someone gets really fucking head kicked when, when, when gonzaga cro copped procop, when he had kicked broke up and knocked them out. I remember I had an interview cop afterwards and he was just reallY, it was a dumb idea to interview him. I sHould've probably protested, but we always interview the winner and the loser and he was up and they said, okay, interview the loser. So I just automatically went to it. But as I was talking to him, I'm like, this poor guy should not be getting interviewed right now. This guy just. He just got knocked unconscious. He's not exactly sure what happened. And I'm asking them questions. You know, when you see something like that, man, you go, wow, there's a fucking price.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       Which jujitsu never feels like there's a price, you know, guys get jacked and even if they get hurt, like he's going to be okay and most of the time, 99 percent of the time. But a marcella garcia man, if he could Just do professional jujitsu, if they could have like a guy like that, you could have professional jujitsu and even put it on tv and it would be exciting because he'd be just catching people all the time. THere's so many good guys now. Marcello is still the king, but there's so many guys out there and still competing like, like Ryan Hall and Jeff Glover and all those new brazilians busted out. I'm rafael mendez cold brina, a rafael lovato. There's so many guys that are good at nogi that it should be in the olympics right away. There's no reason why no good jujitsu shouldn't be in the olympics is a little too slow for people that does that, that board. I mean, you have a funny story about going

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       to watch what john jock. Yeah. That's one that I was always the guy in class that asked the questions about yanking on colors and yanking on sleeves and asking like how is that going to translate in mma? I mean, because I was embarrassed. I. WHen I first started doing jujitsu, I would tell guys, check, check out this next slide. This guy's a jujitsu guy. He's gonna. Fuck him up. He's going to jack him. And the first fight that I got really disappointed with was a bustamante against blender. I love bustamante to death. He's still one of my all time favorite fighters, but I couldn't believe that he couldn't finish them off his back. It was just baffled me. I kept saying, okay, he's going to get them right and he's going to get him on. He's just setting him up. He's going to get them and then it didn't happen and I asked sean, I'm like, what's going on with how come we never see sweeps and finishes off, You know, rarely off, off from the bottom, you'd never see sweeps and finishes at the same rate as you Do at the moon.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       Dealz at the moon. Als are sweeping their, finishing off their back. Like, I mean it's, it's incredible how much action there is like off your back, but not an mma. It was different. So it's because they don't have to hold onto. Yeah. Well if you practice setting up all your submissions and sweeps, yanking and pulling on someone's outfit and that's actually part of the sweep. You take that out and then you also add strikes. Man. It just, it's a whole different game. So, um, you know, what was the question? How did we get this talking about john? Jack watching matches with you and you guys were both saying how boring. Oh yes. Yes. I always, immediately I was questioning the [inaudible] going, man, this could be a problem. This is makinG jujitsu look bad. Like for me it was like, how Does jujitsu and mma and then when I went to the moon deals in 2000 as a purple belt with jacques and we're watching the black belts and like, I can't even keep my eyes open there.

Speaker 2:          01:33:46       It's just so it just, most of tHe matches, one born there were some exciting magic and there still are some vr. There's a lot of exciting matches with the gooey, but generally, I mean we, I was sitting there trying to keep my eyes open and john jack looked over and he goes, man, this is so boring. He wanted to leave. And right there that struck them like, damn one of the fucking baddest jujitsu players of all time. My master is bored with watching black belts. Uh, played tug of war and the gi, that's when I thought, whoa man, they're the key is a problem. And for me, the reason why I started teaching without the g wasn't to separate myself from Brazil, the brazilian jujitsu community. It wasn't, I wasn't me going, fuck you, you know, you guys went the ge. I took off the g for jujitsu. I did this shit for jujitsu and I, you know, that's the one thing I want everybody. I want everyone to understand, especially the brazilians that hate me is I did this for jujitsu. The most important thing for me is how would you jitsu looks and nma and I feel that the key is a problem for mma. So I decided when I opened up the school, I want to try to bring jujitsu back of a, do whatever I can personally, whatever I can do to bring jujitsu back in

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       mma. Well, you did it also because you think that's the most effective way to do it in mma? I mean, yes, no, of course, of course. I thought it was the most effective way and I'm doing it for jujitsu. I feel that if everyone lost the ge, uh, 10 years ago and just focused on no geese submissions, setting up everything in the clench, setting everything up with over hooks, under hooks and had to control as opposed to setting everything up with yanking and pooling collars and sleeves. If we would've started everybody 10 years ago, we just killed the g of heleo would've said, no more gate. We we need to come back. We need to dominate nma again, man. The world would be a different place. We would see. We would see 100 shinya aoki, a hundred havi vasquez. Did you see when Ryan Hall said recently, you know a thing about how he doesn't play garden anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       That always concerned with now is if he winds up on bottom, is sweeping, getting on top to finish. That's beautiful. If you could do it, but what about the guys? You can't sweep. Yeah. He's saying that you can't. He's saying that you can't rely on your garden anymore when you can't rely on sweeps all the time either, but you're going to be on your back regardless and if you could sweep them. I'm. Most of mY game is all about sweets. I'm all about sweeping and getting on top, but you have to prepare for the worst case scenario. A guy That puts on your back and you can't sweep them. You better have a wicked finishing game off your back as well. You got to have both. You can't finish everybody from your back and you can't sweep everybody, but if a dude stuff's just all your sweeps and he stuffs all your finishes, he's just better than you.

Speaker 1:          01:36:21       That's it, you know, but you got to have as much game as possible. It's amazing. Somebody hasn't stepped up and tried to make a professional jujitsu league, you know, I know reconciler really did that thing for a little bit, but you know, he was, he was having a hard time with it, but I think. I think it's more popular now than it was then. The problem with the ricoh temporarily promotion, which was professional submission league psl, great concept. He just had like eight superfight matches. Man. He had, he had marcello and they're against. Jake shields had marcello and they're against cameron earl. He was, but he was the only way he thought he could make it work and sell it to a network or something. Even like espn or something was to have randy couture as the main event and randy couture originally, he retired a few years ago and he wasn't planning on doing mma anymore, but he, he, his plan was just to stay in the mix competitively and do submission grappling.

Speaker 1:          01:37:08       So rico jumped on and said, hey dude, you're going to be the poster boy to this, you're going to blow this up. But then when you decided to go back to mma, he was left without a poster child. And I mean, I think, I think he could make it successful with the guys we have nowadays, like make marcello garcia the poster child and then bring in, you know, cabrina bringing rafael mendez, bringing braulio esteem. Uh, bring in again, Jeff Glover, Ryan Hall, hobby vasquez, all These guys that I'm no hobbies back in the mix in mma now. But I think you could do it now. I don't think you need randy couture. I don't think what they really need is they need to get some sort of a network behind it. Someone who's willing to step up and take a chance with it. But it's hard, man.

Speaker 1:          01:37:48       Look at bella [inaudible] bell tours on like fox sports net. You know what I'm saying? It's like they have a hard time getting a network where people are gonna pay attention to it. If you have jujitsu on fox sports net, it's going to be really tough. You know, there's not a lot of people that are like focused on that. If you get it on espn on the other hand and made a big deal and the difference, the difference between submission grappling and mma, the the advantage. It can be a small advantage in some people's eyes, but people will get into it because anybody can actually practice it and you can go to your local Jujitsu school and you actually can get involved. So and as the potential is there, of course it's not. It'll never be as exciting as dudes smashing skulls and and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       But a submission, grappling with the right guys can be very, very exciting. And I hear, I think it could be successful if they got dogs and frisbees at 1:30 in the morning. You can throw up some nogi Jujitsu up there for sure. They got the pool is huge. I mean paul is on tv all the time, so to starvIng to death, but it's on tv barely. It's barely on tv. A lot of those matches that you watch old matches. The women have some on espn or there's no money in it. No one's making any money overseas to make the real money. Ms dot couple tournament's like the us open. You went out, you went $40,000, get to play for a week and that's only the winner. You know, you get down to like the other people. There's not much. There's not much money in it, but it's still on the air and I could see submission grappling like that on the air and no one's really making that much money except for the top guys.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       But then you got like poker that's making money, right? who wants his fucking poker? the thing about poker is, man, the thing about you watch poker, I love about her is that you could watch and you could know what we all have. Like when you're watching at home, you can't affect the outcome of the game. So you could see like if you had to aces, you had an ace and a king. You could see without you seeing when he had the people watching, could see what he had. So they know everyone is in on it. So how's this gonna play out? And it loaded. What if facebook is like that? Where you knew what the pitcher was gonna throw like right before they let you know. That's interesting because if they let you know a second before you throw, how could he ever get to him?

Speaker 1:          01:40:03       How could it get to him that quick and if he's looking somewhere else, he's keeping his eye. He would fuck them up. That's a good idea right away. Boom. Yeah. If you had the picture had like a little thing on his mouth, you know what? It would have to be someone who could read the signs because the catcher is giving those signs or just do it like a 22nd delay because the catcher gives those signs with the pitcher. Give those signs. Who decides what gets thrown? Think a catcher, the picture can say, no fucking the pitcher has. He's like the executive producer and the producer, but you can have like bitchy arguments. You can totally. You can see that you see him going, oh dude, no, no, no, no. Basically the catcher trying to get them to agree like, okay, what are we going to do? It's up to you, but you want to throw this. I'm just suggesting this, but you could do that with football too, like uh, right before the snap boom. It's going to be a run or something. Dallas is one of the hardest things about putting anything together

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       is getting two people to agree on what should be done. You know, like if you have an executive producer and you have the talent and they're together and they're trying to figure out how to work things out, man, that's a hard fucking thing to come together on. You'd have to put it on a ten second delay then that would ensure that no, for the baseball thing, I mean, if there's no, uh, you, you've had that with music though, right? You've had that with music. We're dudes are trying to fuck with your shit and you didn't like it. Remember that executive producer you were working with for awhile? Which one? The guy down in san diego. Oh yeah. Where you wanted to do all this and do all that. Now. That wasn't a sudden you'll fuck. Exactly. I was all time. Yeah, I've had it happen with everything I've ever done.

Speaker 2:          01:41:30       Everything I've ever done that has to do with creativity. That involves other people. They all want to do. I am open to hear shit. I'm. I've always been that way in every band that I've been in, the rule has always been the same. We are five of us. I'm 22 years old. Everyone's like in their early twenties like anybody can write, but we all have to like it. Like if you want to come up with something, okay. We all have to like it because when you're on stage man, what's most important? You would rather play someone else's good shit. Then you're bad shit. Ooh, you don't want. No one wants to go on stage and the crowd's going, what the fuck is this? And no one's liking and the other guys are going to talk behind their back. Like, dude, I don't want to do this song.

Speaker 2:          01:42:08       And that's the last thing you want. You want to avoid that. It's, you know what I mean? So what ends up happening is real quick, you end up gravitating to the guy who's putting together the best shit. There's always a band where you know that they're just given this fucking drummer a bone, letting them sing right now. There's always a few songs like that, right? Dude, the perfect example is peter criss from kiss. He co wrote a song. Keep thinks he wrote beth, but really bob ezrin wrote it and he'll famous producer. And so it says peter, chris, and bob ezrin. That was the biggest kiss. Tsonga date. Beth was huge. It was a. There was the first one that ever. I was a huge kiss fan, but it was the first one I made it on the radio. Yeah, that was massive. Beth is fucking huge.

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       So peter, chris got a big head because I want to leave kiss. You guys are letting me only write one song. I want to write more songs. He goes, I'm going to make a solo album, and Paul Simon goes, doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo. We'll all make solo albums and we'll put them together, but let's not break up. make a solo album. That's cool. Well, I'll make so long. So they all put out those salons at the same time. Peter christmas album, the guy who wanted to leave to make this all was not only the worst of the solo albums, but it's the worst kiss album ever. He made. He's known for the worst kiss. No kiss fan has ever said they like that album. Really? It's that, that it's that bad. It's bad. Dude. It's really, really, really bad. So he's not in the in the band anymore, but there's a fake peter criss now the way they did it originally when the peter and ace left, they replaced them with new characters like Eric Fox came on to replace of as the fox.

Speaker 2:          01:43:36       Vinny vincent came on to replace ace for the as the egyptian god or something, but then then they finally took the makeup off. They went like 10, 15 years without makeup and then when they put the makeup back, they got peter and ace, the original guys back. They did a couple of reunion tours in the exact same thing happened. Peter fucked up, fucked up. so they kicked him out. But this time, what happened to the fox? Where'd that guy go? He died actually, no. Um, but uh, when they, when they did the reunion tour, you got to bring back the original guys because there was two other guys that were a trigger of this picture. It's a really tattooed on this guy's side. He was a, he was a Bartender or a server at the cap city kid kidney bobby. And he rented a ace and he was drunk and he was talking all this shit to ace Freely and he's feeling.

Speaker 2:          01:44:19       He goes, fuck you kid. So he gets a picture tattooed on him with, fuck you kid, let's put it up here. THat's amazing. So yeah, but I'll put it on my twitter later today. But he got this fucking tattoo of ace freely tattooed on his whole side of his body is permanently a big picture of a shitty one to have ace freely where it says, fuck you kid underneath it. That's incredible. So when they decided to do the reunion, they got the original guys, ace and peter. It's been like 15 years. Of course they wanted to do. They realized, fuck we fucked up. God dammit. Why don't we leave, kiss and get kicked out at the same time? It's like both. They both got back in the reunion tours were massive. They did a couple and then peter started fucking up at a. Started fucking up.

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       Somehow they left. so instead of getting new guys with new characters, they got new guys to play. Ace and peter did. And they, they, they kept to the guys and say as no, they never did that. They never did. No, they never pretended like that was the real ace. And that was the real peter. Maybe they did the first few shows. Maybe they try to do some shenanigans. Not saying that did shenanigans. I said, they said, you know, and now starring as Bang, and they say the guy's name. I don't know. They've never felt safe. Never said no. They said the real guys name the because because what happened is when they did the reunion tour, eric singer, the non makeup kiss drummer and bruce kulik, the non makeup kiss guitar player, they got leFt in the behind because we're going to do a reunion tour and blow this shit up.

Speaker 2:          01:45:45       This non makeup banning happened to. But. But when peter left, they got the non makeup dude, eric singer to play peter. So he came in and he didn't. He always said he was eric singer, but they know that most of the fans that are coming don't even know the difference. Oh man. I liked kiss me when I was a kid. I'm gonna. Go check out kids. They're fucking cool man. Rock and roll all night. They have no idea. They realized they never hide it. They never deny it, but they know that it doesn't really matter. They're just going to come up. We're going to say, that's eric singer. We're going to say that's tommy thayer plan a's, but most of the people aren't even going to notice what was the deal with age freely and peter criss or why couldn't they get it together? The exact same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:46:25       Drugs and alcohol and peter and then again all to peter. Peter was not a very good drummer back when he practiced a lot and when you. I mean it sucked. Jujitsu, man. You don't fucking keep practicing. You lose your chops. You have a drummer, has to be like a fucking machine literally on time. And peter and paul and gene have never, never stopped touring, never stopped putting out albums. Those guys that are machines, they could sing their ass off and they could play. I mean paul is unconscious playing and singing and gene. He's a mo. One of the most underrated bass players ever. He can sing fucking harmonies like the beatles, paul and gina machines, bro. So what they got, they were decided to replace eric singer, the old non makeup kiss guy. They brought them in. They put peter criss makeup on him when he can and he can sing.

Speaker 2:          01:47:15       Eric singer can sing it and he can play his ass off. He's an amazing drummer and he could sing. So they go, we're going to bring this guy back. Does he sing beth now this? Yes, this is. This is. They did a reality show, you know, they did a. The success, the gene simmons show was so successful that they ended up doing it and they would show spots of kiss during the gene simmons reality show, but then they kind of did a spinoff. Why don't we just follow kiss? So reality shows all fucking fake. You know what I mean? So most they had to make even the ones that are real, the camera that the facial reactions like they have like one camera there and how they're getting honey panning to all these facial reactions. They like storing these facial reactions from what you know from two weeks ago.

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       There's a good one to look. That's how they do it different. Yeah. That's how fake it is. So with the gene set, with a kiss reality show, there was like a mini series wral or it might be an ongoing show. They have to create some drama, so what are their following around and eric singer who's dressed like peter is like, Jean, can I do beth in the for the next show? And then jeans, all you know, a promise, peter that we wouldn't do beth. I don't know if like, come on dude, let me do bath. So then eric singer disappears. They're about to do a show. Where's eric singer? We started an hour. No one's been able to find them all. They're all looking for uyghur singer. He's like, fuck it. Let's get the roadie and get them and makeup we're going to get. We're just going to do the show without them.

Speaker 2:          01:48:29       We're going to get the ready to do it. They never show the roadie putting on makeup or anything getting ready. THey were just like, oh man. And then all of a sudden eric shows up backstage. He's all dressed up and makeup and he goes, they're going onstage and he looks over to peter goes or to paul. Stanley is gene can lmp two path or not in paul goes, bro, Just get up on stage, man. I don't think so. Something like that. It's all ridiculous, dude. Fake drama and then he sings it. I don't. I don't. I didn't even get that far. It was ridiculous. It was ridiculous, man. Having them argue backstage about singing. Beth, is there a way to do a reality show and not have fake shit? No editing allowed. It's just one camera. it is, but it might not be interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:49:12       You gotta have it. Got three cameras to some people. I'd rather watch an hour that I know is 100 percent real than an hour. That's like you said, have just chopped up. So that should insults the fuck out of me when I watched like keeping up with the kardashians and I see bruce jenner running around town trying to fucking meet a deadline or something stupid where I know it's not real and like, come on man, the fake show on my shit is done just all out of fun, man. We want it fake. We do those fake. We do. We're storing a facial reactions and stuff from people just putting them in. We're having fun with it. It's like all things. What he's talking about is a

Speaker 5:          01:49:47       10th planet jiu jitsu. Dotcom has got a thing called mastering the system and it's like a fake jujitsu reality show, but there's real, real techniques in there. I real techniques, but we just have fun with stan with shenanigans. That's hilarious. Is the whole, uh, an auto thing? What is the deal with that? Is that. Oh, the latest episode that just went up. He chokes me up. We get in a fight and he talks about and it puts out any leaves people. Have people figured out what's going on yet or do people think it's the most people know it's fake, but there's a small percentage. Like I just got someone, a forum member from the day one. This girl emailed me yesterday, said, I, you know, I respect your you to death and all that, but I have to know once and for all, is the helper thing real?

Speaker 5:          01:50:33       She goes, I just got a note. Either way, if it's real, it's real, it's cool. But if it's fake, just let me know. I just don't know. Like, wow, you don't know. You know, there's so much evidence. People are piecing together, they're taking footage of the days of our lives. They're putting it on a forum and I just keep deleting it. Any, any evidence? I just delete it. Just delete it. It's a tricky thing, man. When people fake it, when people fake anything. You know that video I just saw the other day of a alan belcher, a pumpkin. You. You ever see that video after you've seen it? You haven't seen it. There's a video of you punking him at your school and then he punks. You remember that was columbus, philadelphia, somewhere. Somewhere. But he got you. I knew it right away. I was like, no fucking way.

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       I just thought he was crazy because this guy's nuts. I wasn't hearing what he was saying. I was just going, oh, I guess I always start like the first time I ever met alan belcher, it was after an awesome victory. I talked to him a little bit and invited them into my school. I thought he was like, uh, I got mad. This guy can snap. He was seemed like a snapper. I keep just like I seen. I'm like, damn, I'm like a little scared of him. I didn't really know it. Just in the first time we met, he had just beat someone's ass. His lip was all fucked up and it was quivering. You got to cut live and it was quivering and I'm like, man, I'm like, dude, I would love to show you some, some rubber guard shit you know, and come on down to the gym and I for a second, I thought, man, this guy, he could snap on him.

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       He ended up being a super fucking sweetheart. He's totally cool. I love alan belcher, but when he tried to punk me, what was the premise of it? I don't even remember. He got mad about something. I don't remember, but I remember as soon as it started coming, as soon as it happened, he was screaming. I turned to the camera, went no. like he was trying to fight you. No, no, it wasn't me. I was on the outside. I was on the outside. You and you were trying to keep him for getting mad about something and he was. I think he was going to start a fight with a bouncer or something. He was getting nuts with a bouncer and I was going, oh no, fuck. We got a crazy amount of fucking. He's gonna fight a bouncer right now, but that is a problem if you hang out with a certain number of mma fighters. There's a few, you know, always one or two that's a loose cannon. You never know. A couple of drinks getting. I'm shaking and that Judy Browning was at my school last night. Oh, he's totally cool, man. I love

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       Judy Browning, but before I actually met him, he was the only guy ever that I saw on the ultimate fighter and you know, we're always backstage running into these guys all the time and that new season comes on. I go, oh, I got to remember these dudes because I want to be running to him all the time. I don't want to not know their names and feel like a total douche bag. So I'm like this. I'm like watching the show, studying their fighting techniques, seeing what kind of fighter they are and what kind of personality they have. One, they showed joni browning on top. I thought to myself, man, this guy can snap on anybody. I don't want to get to know this guy. I made the decision in my head, don't get close to that guy. That guy was holding in las vegas. We're eating at nine and he was a really nice guy and what happened was it was a big fan of yours and that's.

Speaker 2:          01:53:31       I tried to avoid him. I didn't even want to talk to him. I just talk from the show. They made him seem like a total lunatic. Right. So I'm in. Sean tompkins trained him and he just fuck somebody up and on spike show in vegas and we're at nine the places I see sean pumpkin's walking towards me and I'm like, I'd love sean tompkins. So as soon as he came up I like, you know, we gave, we gave each other a little hug and I saw that. Oh damn. Johnny brown is right behind him and his buddy. So I hugged sean tompkins and kind of look the other way, trying to pretend like I didn't notice any brownie. I'm going, fuck man. Here he comes. He's coming right for me. Shit. He's with sean tompkins. I hear him right next to me. It's like right over my shoulder.

Speaker 2:          01:54:08       And he almost passed me by booz buddied from Kentucky. Said, hey, there's eddie bravo. And I'm like, oh shit, he's going to come up. So he tapped me on the shoulder and I looked over and I was, hey dude, what's going on dude? Great fight. Fuck. And I'm thinking, oh shit, I'm actually talking to him. Holy shit. What's going to happen? And then he goes, bro, man, we're always studying your books and smoking weed and, and um, and uh, on the mat with your book out. I do rubber guard. I got a good twister. And all of a sudden like, whoa, this guy's, this guy's a 10th planet fan. Like all of a sudden I got, I got to get this guy a chance maybe. Maybe I prejudged him. and he turned out to be a fucking cool guy, man. And he's thinking about moving to la and to get away from vegas.

Speaker 2:          01:54:48       He's not partying anymore. He just wants to clean up his life and, and, uh, make a big combat. Still a young kid, right? Isn't he? And he's funny as hell too, because when he's funny, that motherfucker's funny. He doesn't have to be drunk. After jujitsu. We hung out in the parking lot and uh, he made all of us laugh quite a few times. He's got some video shit, man. He's a cool dude. He just, you know, he had a bad upbringing. His dad used to beat the shit out of him and you're going to come up, you're going to have order, kinks, kinks. That's all. I mean, we've, we've run into so many guys over the years that started out like that and then eventually got their shit together, you know, one way or another. I mean, it's fun to watch guys like that evolve and become something better than what they were like. Chris, a perfect example of guy started. I was kind of a brawler and now he's like a fucking like after you put erin simpson away, he's like a seasoned motherfucker now. Triangled akiyama. Yeah. For real. Chris stevens, a bad man. He's smart man and I believe that Judy Browning, I believe that he's too

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       smart to throw his life away. He's not smart. He's, but he was an idiot. He might. He might just keep fucking hell. You would benefit from hanging around human if he, if you understand troubled childhoods and channeling that shit into something positive and being around positive people, man, that's the most important thing to, for having a positive life, being around a bunch of other people that are on the same wavelength as you. Trying to do the same shit. And that's one of the cool things about a 10th planet jiu jitsu in hollywood is that everyone is super positive there and it all trickles down from, you know. Well, you know that right? I mean it all trickles down from you. I mean, a lot of places if you go to there and the instructors kind of douchey and people can get douchey with each other and there's none of that at our place.

Speaker 5:          01:56:26       Everybody's very cool. All I'm doing really is acknowledging that everyone has an ego. I have an ego. Everybody has an ego and I just, every day I tried to do things to keep that ego in check because if I don't, if I'm not consciously trying to keep it in check, sometimes it just pops up and fucks up. You know what I mean? So, you know, I, I, and the, it rubs off on my students. My students are constantly, you know, like the ego flares up, you know, they can catch themselves, they can correct themselves. It's a lifelong process, man, that you know, everybody has an ego and they, everyone struggled with podcasts is a part of their two man. I've talked to a bunch of people that I've met all over the world. One of the most important ones was this kid that I met in boston who is from Ireland, who was explaining that man.

Speaker 5:          01:57:12       He goes, I don't, we don't have anybody like this near me. No one talks like this. No one gives us this. There's no one around it that's a thinker this way that thinks about life this way. It's openminded. And he goes and because of this podcast is making me like, like reassess the way I evaluate life and reassess the way I talk and think about things. Having guys like you teaching jujitsu, having a podcast like this, like this, like a serious, like a serious connection we have to all these people and they helped me too, man. I've, I've gotten a bunch of cool tweets from people and inspirational shit and cool articles that people tweeted me and cool things that people post on the message board and it's all like a big thing together. You know? It's all a big thing. Everybody helping everybody else now.

Speaker 5:          01:57:55       It's so much fun. Every day I drive to class, I remind myself on the way to class and how lucky I am. Like, I'm dry, this is my job. I mean, I didn't even look at like, look at like a job, look at like a job, look at it like a job. Sorry. But I mean every day is a day off for me, man. And I appreciate so much just going to class and everyone's just sitting there and they're waiting for me to teach them how to strangle like, you know, in an efficient way. Like how fucking lucky am I. I can't believe that every, it's, it's amazing. And the cool thing about jujitsu for people don't know is everybody's real friendly to each other man. I mean, people catch people all the time and, and you know, an arm bars and chokes and shit like that and you know, you don't want to get caught, but there's no, no fights ever breakout, no bullshit ever happens. It's all just, you

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       know, damn, I got caught. Hi, what did I do wrong? Or you forgot to put your arm in. Oh shit. Oh thank you. And you know, it's a massive misconception about jujitsu, that jujitsu classes or a bunch of meat heads, they're douchebags dick heads. And She would think it's like we trained in a cage and it's a bunch of computer nerds that, that are playing the ultimate virtual reality game because if you're into video games and like killing someone by pressing a button, but no one's really dying, but you enjoy that, that feeling. Jujitsu is the ultimate virtual reality video game. It's where we is going to end up feeling more like a baseball bat, like a golf club. How about you can can actually kill people, you know, theoretically or you know with jujitsu you put someone under choke, they tap out. It was like you killed them because of you didn't let them go.

Speaker 2:          01:59:28       You would actually kill them and you can learn. You can anybody. there's so many jujitsu schools all over the world. You can learn how to systematically and scientifically break limbs and put people to sleep. There's over 20 different ways you can put someone to sleep just with the neck. You know, there's probably more, I'm just guessing, at least 20. All of these different chunks. So many different variations of guillotines doris as a chat and it becomes just a really fun game too. It's an amazing guy killing game where, I mean I hurt my arm like a couple of weeks ago, you know, but like you know, for the most part when you get to go to, you know, get involved in like, like serious rolling with somebody. Everybody's fine at when it's over, you know, you get caught with something, he just tap and 99 percent of the time you're fine.

Speaker 2:          02:00:17       Every now and then you'll get something in something I'll get tweaked or you need to get twisted. I know you had a knee problem that happened recently. Both my are fucked up, but it's so fun. You never think about stopping doing it. You just think, man, I can't wait for myself to heal up. Exactly. So I can get back in and you're like fuck. Like when you, when you tweak something or like god damn I probably out a couple of weeks and it's just fun. It's so much fun. I mean it's. Think about this. You have to work out. Everybody has to work out. If you're in perfect shape, you have to maintain, you have to keep working on why not work out and learn how to take people out, put them to sleep at the same time and it's and it's the ultimate video game.

Speaker 2:          02:00:55       It's exercise. You learn some serious self defense. It can come up at any time in your life. It's valuable and it gives you so much confidence and it's so much fun. It's kills video games. It's like there's anything. You meet a lot of great people that have their ego in check because if, if you don't have your ego in check, then those people don't survive jujitsu. That tapping is that ego? A douche bag filter. The tapping because dudes that are just just there, it's where their eagle rules. They can't jump on the mat and get tapped out. They run from it or they get on the edge of the mats are like, no way am I going to let people tap me out and they don't really don't know what's going on, but subconsciously, the fear of being dominated and tapping out by losing, looking like a week

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       lane that scares people away. You got to look at it like you're just learning. You. Of course you're going to get tapped out in the beginning and the more the more you come, the more dedicated you are. As time passes, you start tapping dudes out occasionally, but still, you're usually tapping or beginner, but ultimately one or two years, man, you, you can minimize those taps and you're getting your learning. If you did, you just jitsu for two years, the odds are in a street fight one on one. The odds are way on your side way on your side. If you know anybody could, anything could happen in a street fight, but man, a guy that's trained jujitsu two years against the guy who has zero training on the ground. Another great aspect of it is it a calms down your body and it makes you realize how much of an influence stress and just the fact that we have this ancient chimpanzee hardware in our system, our bodies are set up for hunting and gathering and carrying things and our bodies are set up to exert a certain amount of energy and if you don't exert a certain amount of energy with your body, your body starts to betray you and you start to get really stressful and you start to snap at things they wouldn't ordinarily snap out.

Speaker 4:          02:02:42       Oh, you shouldn't rationally be upset about. It allows you to put things into perspective. It calms your body down. I was very important, man. Yeah, I mean, are you saying Jujitsu is better than quake? Are you going to start that? There's a bunch of people put a bunch of videos of cool video games that are out there, man. Fuck. You know, lIke to try to tell me that there's all these different video games. Man. There's some insane shit. There's this one, I don't know the name of it, but they were. It was like it looked like they were in the jungle and they were like near something like it looks like some mayan temples and shed. The graphics are insane. Rushing attack. I don't know what it is, man. I don't know what it is. I don't remember what someone put just a demo up and then someone put crisis out of it.

Speaker 4:          02:03:22       I don't know what it was, but at the demo was insane and then crisis was another one that was pretty interesting. A bunch of dudes runnIng around shooting people, but then I put a video of went to watch a video of quake online and I go back to what I said nothing could fuck real quick because I understand that these games are beautiful. I understand these games have all these cool things you can do quick for. All I want to do is fuck people up in one-on-one death matches. That's what I like to do, but yet you're not even talking to. I understand what you're saying, man. No, I'm just saying that if you like death matches, they've taken that the formula of death match and it just added onto it for like the last 15, 20 years or whatever. How long? Well, quake three was a quick four was 2000 something.

Speaker 4:          02:04:04       It was like 2005 or 2007, so for the last five, six on my number, but they've taken the formula. They even use the same engine on call of duty when it first came out and they've just improved it and proved it and proved it and like a lot of these games that like last week I was talking about like keyboard and mouse necessarily is better than controller argument. My point is is that the games are better now. The games are better now. They're not geared towards the accuracy of a keyboard and mouse as much as they are geared for just having a fun experience. Yeah, there's a lot of auto wave going on.

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       It's just easier to. People still do those driving games. Yeah. Yeah, totally. To me though, the what, what's fun to me about video games. I understand all that, but what's fun to me, it's just I got addicted straight up to one on one matches and even like the death matches, you know, just the fact that you have this incredibly precise control over the eight year, more like the pool statistic version of video games. I mean it's all just a very small majority. Yeah. Most people like to play football games and the control is perfect for that. With quick games, those one-on-one first person shooters. It's just so precise. It's so addictive. Man. When you were talking about, was your cousin's addicted to know my nephew, nephew, man. When I was a little kid, if he hit me with some quake, I would have lost my life.

Speaker 4:          02:05:20       I would have never got into martial arts. I would have never got productive with my life. I would have never paid attention in school. Joe. There's a game on steam that you can play on your mac that has nothing to do with it, but I want you to. Next time you're bored and you just want to spend it because it's a really short game so you can't get addicted to it. Like it's like literally you could beat it in like six hours really, but it's called portal and I think ours, jesus, I ain't got six hours like our kids. No, I mean, but six hours spread up for like a month. But that's a, that's an addiction. You will that. That game alone will set your mind racing to wildland. How crazy video games are nowadays. So what is the best one right now? If I wanted to get something for xbox and something that just got blow my fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          02:05:59       Here's a war for you. I would probably go with more of like a borderlands or something like that, but I would actually find a game that you could play on your mac. You know, like a game, like call of duty that you can play. I think he called dd four is on there and there's a couple scenes from call of duty for that will blow your fucking mind. You know red. There's a red one, red something cowboy one. Don't get that shit. That's just grand theft auto, but using a horse and cowboy. What's it called? It's called red dead dawn or something like that. I gave it a chance, but I was like, all right, this is grand theft auto. I don't wanna play anymore. That was a hugely successful game though. Super. You know, it's just people like that formula and I'm sure it's bigger and better than grand theft auto, but for me I just played it and I'm like, I'm done with that. I don't want to play that anymore. I'm over that. They say that ea martial arts game is a bust. Nobody's buying it. Really haven't played the us. Do you have like a good one? Cool. The new one that we're working on right now, who thinks it is?

Speaker 7:          02:06:57       What the fuck? Pick up the phone. Cock sucker. That's not what happened. Go back to that Alex Jones transcript. Your calls.

Speaker 4:          02:07:09       Brian brian. Callum must've just gotten to the tank, but before we're going to do the podcast, he was about getting a tank for the first time. It was brian here. No, not here. No. At a place in venice. The headquarters float lab.com. So I think what we got today is that eddie bravo loves ufos. I love them. And jujitsu. I love them. Like bunnies and brian loves cats and one hit of weed instead of three. You got to hard today. No, no, I'm just saying tHat I liked my high high today. One hit that. I think that's all I need. No more than two and two if they're going to be too. It's too light. Ones your shit. Fucking fuck me up this week. and by the way, like he, like we smoked before we went on stage, actually smashed. Talk about that. We smoked and then joey diaz told me five minutes later going, oh well I might put you up on stage and I'm like, what?

Speaker 4:          02:07:57       I'm going up. Sold out joe rogan show. No, it. Uh, so I was completely baked out of my mind the first couple of days, but we dId this weekend. It was different was we took str on the road. Who's little esther was brian's friend who's a, um, an emerging standup comedian in la. And she's only 22 years old, he's only been doing comedy like two years and we just said, well, let's just fucking just for an experiment, see what it's like to take this kid and throw her up in front of a real crowd. Like she did. Great. Yeah. [inaudible] dot com. Dude. She's fucking good man. She's confident and smooth. And for someone who's only been doing comedy for two years, she's way better than I was two years into it. And I told her that when I was two years into it, I was a mess.

Speaker 4:          02:08:36       I was a clunky fucking goofy mass. Is it okay that she's had she known for looking really young? YeaH, that's her characters. She looks like she's 12. Seriously. What's her name? Esther. Little test or little esther. Her feet seriously are smaller than my hands, but smelled like they're twice as big. Well, just kidding. Get the fuck man. She's thrown under the bus. She's, she's funny man. She was furious. She did a good job. And you did a good job too, man. It was interesting watching you loosen up from the first set you did on thursday night to the last set you did on saturday night, which was your best one, right? You slow to admit to your jetta. That second set. Saturday I acted like I smoked marijuana before I went onstage before I went on stage, the second chat. Remember before we all, we all didn't really smoke out because I was like, no, do it, do it.

Speaker 4:          02:09:22       And I'm like, no, I don't want. So the data show that you had, was the one where you weren't high, you went high at all? No, it must've been a little high from the first time, but that was like, it had leveled off because you were nervous. Weed isn't that great when You're nervous man. And he realized that that you were probably, you hide got paranoid and I was getting high like and then going on stage like five minutes later. That's not a good mix for me, adam. It's not good mixture of the podcast either before we've done that. Many times we get high right before we do the podcasts, like today, first words out of my mouth while I crawls and they don't come out that good. Right. But like right now or two hours in, it's all smooth and once you're killing and you're really confident you can't wait to go on state.

Speaker 4:          02:10:01       Then the weed will take it through the roof. Yeah. But even then you gotta make sure you don't get too hard. I think red bull and vodka, what are one or two of them before on stage is the key ingredient for standup comedy? One or two red bull's and vodka. Red bull vodka. I like a little bit of weed. Some calisthenics. My best teaching always comes from me being high when I teach because I'm so confident with it that it adds to it. Like I'll be pissed off. Like if I forget, if I forget, like I forgot. I don't have lead right now and I didn't teach class today stoned this morning. I didn't teach guide. I felt pretty good. I mean if it was a good class, but I always feel like when I'm high it's just like I don't want a class to end. I want her to keep going. I want more time. When I'm in that space, in that zone, like shit, I'm running out of time. There's so much I've got to say and show when we don't show. We got high in the car right before we went in there. We want like three. Here's Alex Jones show would be cool. High though. Well, it's bewildering though because when we walked in,

Speaker 5:          02:10:59       no, I walked in. Joe there about two d a devalue the dollar. They're going to take the dollar way. It's been proven to your forbes there. Their ex rang your home. They're driving by and vans and they're taking photos. You irradiating your house with deadly radiation that can give cancer. He's poor people, so it's like you go from right out of the car. Everybody's laughing. We're talking shit. We're breaking down country music. There was like some ridiculous country music song, you know, below only girls make the best lovers. We were laughing our asses off and then you go right in their death, destruction, new world order. He leads global warming.

Speaker 4:          02:11:39       What was he saying about the radiation and is a crazy fucking real thing they're doing where they're driving through neighborhoods and they're blasting these cars with these super powerful x rays from these vans and they're looking inside of vehicles. They have photos of the show was in forbes magazine. He pulls up the story and shows it to me and they're doing it to houses too. They Just drive by and point this fucking crazy x ray gun at cars and see right through and they show all these photos of people looking at like bricks of cocaine. The back of a van like this is nuts, man. Like they, they can, they can shoot x-rays. It just makes me, it just makes me really wonder though how like people go on and the radiation, like what exactly how strong it is because the other day I was talking to my dentist and he said like, you know, uh, this radiation is about equal to standing next to a microwave.

Speaker 4:          02:12:29       That's what he said. Yeah. Something like that. I forgot. I don't know what to where a lead vest when you microwaves or popcorn. I don't know. I don't know what that's for, but that he said it's not that big a deal. that's why he's not wearing the lead vest, you know? And well the crazy thing is that there's radiation around us all the time. Make yourself space microWaving your brain every time you put up. No one knows what's happening with those. Right? Yeah. So what happens though when you're in your car though, and you got a hands free, is that okay? Well, not when you have your phone between your crotch when you're tryIng to cook. And it was a study released recently that. So that laptops cook your balls. Oh yeah. Cook your sperm. That's, that's totally makes sperm and effective. If you have your laptop on your lap. Yeah. You cook in your balls but not up there. No, no, no, no. He did. He cook shit balls. I never put my laptop on my lap. Yeah, I got this thing for that very reason. So I got this little pad that sits on the laptop. It makes them more comfortable anyway because the bottom is soft, so it sort of molds to your legs and with that note you got that italian song. No, it wasn't. It says find youtube user does not

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       allow mobile views or something like that. So sorry. Is this. It would have been the perfect ending. What is this? Your plan?
