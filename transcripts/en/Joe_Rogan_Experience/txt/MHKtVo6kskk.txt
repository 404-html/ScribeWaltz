It's not an enjoyable, whenever I think of Europe, I mean even though I've been to Europe and I love it, I think

Speaker 3:          00:04:01       World War II movies. Yeah. Them having to like the buckers freezing food out of cans, hearing bombs go off in the background, just coming down from the ceiling. Well, you know, I was thinking the other day when I was looking at all this crazy shit that's been going on in England, these terrorist attacks and uh, what happened in France and I was just thinking how long that section of the world has been in turmoil. I should always fighting. Always fighting. Yeah. And then I was thinking that like America is one of the only places where very little shit has gone down. Like little things have gone down there. There were obviously big at the time, like Pearl Harbor is huge at the time, but very few. And then nine 11. And other than that, it's like, Whoa, boy. What else? And then you look at Europe, like, Holy Shit, dude, there's a part of France that's the size of Paris that you can't go into because there's so many bombs.

Speaker 3:          00:05:02       There were so much munitions from the world wars. Oh really so bad that they have like a area, the size of parents' minds and stuff. Just musicians. Just fucking missiles and shit. Things that were flying there that landed things, things that blew off all sorts of chemical waste. Oh Dude. It's toxic. See if he could pull that up. Really? Me? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, I feel like it's outside of Normandy. I forget where it is, but there's a section of, of France that is literally the size of Paris that people can't go into for like a hundred thousand years. Oh yeah. Just cause it's all this like chemical waste just because of all the waste from the bombs and all the different fucking missiles and rockets out guns and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:05:50       Dude. It's crazy. It's crazy. Wow. But obviously I don't have the facts in front of me until Jamie it up and I'm my shit. Shitty memory. But I know that this is a real place and I know that there's leftover like wings of plans. I think it's mostly like things they shot at each other and unexploded, some of them on unexploded, some of them exploded. Like the waste from them. Oh yeah. Here it is. This is a map of the space. All these fucking bombed. That didn't go out on the cobblestone streets. They'll get those things, dude, these are all bombs that didn't go off. That guy's there. Yeah, with that guy knows what he's doing. He's just touching it. They pulled that one. Ask God. Imagine if it went off right next to the water or water area. It says founding contains certain toxic levels of arsenic that were 300 times above.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       The tolerant tolerated amount and a abnormally high lead levels were recorded in some animals, particularly in the livers of hunted. Wild boar. They buried it all. I think it's just there, man. I think it did just have this area. I don't think they burry. It looks like they put it under under mountains of dirt. Is that what's going on? And then shook. Grew. Does it say that? No, because mountains look like that. I don't get up to the top. Cool freaking no go zone of France forbidden. No Man's land poisoned by war. Ooh Dude. I mean look at that guy with the gas mascot. That is awesome. Yeah, it is up. There was up to is. Why does it even look a little bit so clearly? It's not even like it's like chalk paper. It is a dope picture. But I was reading and looking at the photo.

They can do flat out free tattoos. I've seen those. Wow. Incredible. Godly. Yeah Dude. Tattoo artists. Like all artists I guess or just because of the Internet, but yeah. And then they're taking things to another level because they're seeing the level of all these other people in like a guy in Germany can compare itself for the guy in Japan and the guy in America. Yeah. Like Jesus Christ. God Damn Hat. It looks like a skin is falling off. Yeah, there's a lot of fire was great. Really good tattoo artists out there right now. Really good.

Well how about Gucci Mane got a fucking ice cream cone tattooed on his face and it says burr rarely. Yes, dude. He got an ice cream cone tattooed on his face and it says birth. We are our our call this, I'm not kidding. He's not like an ice cream guy though. I like his music though, but it's not all about ice cream. Look, God damn. Wow. It says Burr burr and then the meme spelled [inaudible] wrong. Does lightening bolts off the ice cream cone? I feel like that was put in later. No, I think that was the same time. Ice Cream and ice and lightning. Yeah. Ice Cream in lightening. That's real. That's his tattoo.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       The this case like three scoops of ice cream. Oh, good for him. It's give me a hard fight for him to find a job though. Yeah. He doesn't have a job. He's a rapper. He doesn't need a job. I mean, okay. I don't want to see inside of the lip on the inside of the lip on, it's weird. It's like I'm going to swear right free. It's that. Yeah, it's out of the way. I sneaky freak my freakiness inside my face. There's no versions with tattoos. Well, I'm sure there must be. Maybe. I'm sure there must be, but not really though. It's not even unusual. We don't think we would. It a little bit about asexual. People do believe in asexual people. Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. Right? Yeah. I've seen a couple. Some people just don't touch, don't touch me. Thanks. Sorta of thing. That's a horrible word to stamps. I have. It's not like they just are antisocial. They just don't want to play. You have no interest in it. Yeah. So what about them? Oh they, what? Did they get? Tattoos? Yeah. I don't think it ever happens. Wow. You're a, so there's a tattoo is stick to like commit to it. Yeah. Opinion. Yeah, exactly. Does it matter if I didn't research it? Sure. You're not even totally sure. A hundred percent short man. Wow. It's just doubling down. Interesting. I like how you did that. You've raised your voice. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       There's something about movement. Have you seen this fucking video? I don't know if you know what's going on in a evergreen college. Do you know where Evergreen colleges, evergreen state college in the north. It's in Pacific northwest and there's this crazy shut down. I this professor on

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       the podcast because they, um, the kids had asked him to not show up at school and not know why people shortage because yeah, they wanted a a day where whites didn't and he's like, that is the opposite of inclusiveness. Like this is, this is not what we're supposed to be doing. So they kick him out, right? He's instead of saying, no, how about everybody day? Well, this is what they did. They didn't really kick them out. What they did is they protested, they yelled and screamed and he felt unsafe and he left the college and then the college got shut down due to shut down. Oh, really? Threats. Yeah. People would call it in. They even played the threats on the air. What did we threats with the, he was already gone. No other people called in like threaten the college. Yes, because like right wing people called, they called them a bunch of commies.

Speaker 3:          00:12:41       The left like a voicemail saying I was going to come, I'm going to come down with my 45 magnum you that's know too far. Yeah. 44 magnum, maybe 44. He specified the round, which I thought was hilarious. Like the exact type of gun. I have to come with a shotgun. I know it's just a game like, um, but uh, anyway, the college professor got in trouble like talking to these kids. They told him to put his hands away cause he was gesturing with their hands and there was, there were yelling out that it's a micro aggression and they got him, they got him to put his hands down and then they started laughing at him. Oh Dude. It was like put your hands up, fight, see if he could find it. Jeremy was, I think his bladder aggression. I think I, I'm trying to figure maybe Bret Weinstein had it queued up on his, um, his twitter page.

Speaker 3:          00:13:36       He's the professor. That word by the way, it was dead on. It's just the connotative meaning now it's become something super negative. Microaggressions, micro aggression, not even a small aggression. Well it's like the smallest possible thing you can think of in terms of aggression and you're like, okay, sure, whatever. But if you watch the video of this guy is just moving his hands, he's just talking like this and they're like, put your hands down at your hands are aggressive, let's do it. And then they laugh at him when he complies. They openly mocked him and laugh. We're fooling with it. We didn't really believe that we turned it into a cook there little kids, these are little kids that you're, you know, when you talk to people who understand how brains develop, one of the big things that they always say is the frontal lobe.

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       The frontal cortex doesn't really develop until you're like 25 it's not fully developed there. They're just, I was in college. I understand. Yeah, we're not going to power. We're learned a few things. We don't know how to put it into play yet until you just say it. And that's by the, by the way, that's my theory and why people send their kids away to college. It's because they're fucking embarrassing and they don't want them anywhere near them while they're trying to grow into real people. Oh Wow. They're learning stuff and they're like, wait, we don't have anything grow. Think does that. Oh yeah. A little bit. Also they say for the experience of going away, but like, no, it's like, hey fucking be an awful developing thing away from me. Go embarrass someone in Wisconsin. Interesting. Yeah. Here, this Nyu girls talking all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:15:03       I stand behind them and like listen. Oh yeah. You know the conversations, girls and boys, you know, mostly girls you create, I mean, you know, he creeping sort of short, obviously super into that, but like, uh, but yeah, they're just dumb. They're dumb when you listen to them and you're like, you're just well read and dumb. Well, there's a lot of people that, I mean are 18 years old and you have very intelligent conversation with them. I'm sure. Some, yeah, there's a lot of medicine and there's a lot of people who are 18 who are basically 12. They're basically like a grownup baby. It's not their fault. It's no one's fault, you know? It's just, uh, take some people longer to kind of get how to, you know, sort of factor all the aspects of life together and make it some sort of a manageable plan for yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       Live your life. But the idea of those kids being able to run that, that principle and run that, the president of that school like that and just tell you, put your hands down and laugh at him. Dude, they laughed at him. I heard a few smart people going about trump and people like small hands, you know, and the, and the left we'll, we'll attack that. It's like, oh he got a small dick or your master's here. And I saw one, I think, I forget who comedian I used to open mikes with any show writer. Now I forget who it was. But um, she was like, don't say that. Don't take their tactics. Don't say look sir, an important thing here. Yeah, that's, that's that we believe in. So stop saying that. Not only that you're going to shame the shit out. All those guys that are out there that actually have small, her point was like, don't, don't just cause you know, that will affect him.

Speaker 3:          00:16:36       You're doing the same thing. The right does. Don't do that. Yeah. He's not amazing though that that is what we decided to do as a collective group of humans to find the thing that you can mock about him physically. Like his Dick is little, he's got small hands, look at your small hands and then there's people in the audience and actually have small hands. They're like, fuck trump's a big giant guy. Is it really tall? He's like six two, he's probably like your height. Oh Wow. He's a big guy. Like he's a big imposing guy. Like if you see that's, that was the one of the speculations about Jim Comey that um, James Comey that trump didn't like him because he was six foot eight. Oh. Cause he's huge. James Comey was like this giant basketball player. Like, dude, you're like, yeah. And he just towered over everybody including trump. Trump's like, get rid of that fucking guy. I'm sure it was more card is my, because he's investigating. But that's more of shaming. People love to do that. Oh, you tiny little man. Yeah. It's weird because you, you're attacking something that's the person can't change at all. Like what do you like? What do you care if he had small like look how big call me. It's called me. He's a giant. Wow. Super person

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       who's going to size it morphs everybody. Oh my God. He's huge. He didn't ignore this guy. You know, you, I, if I was Donald Trump and I was in this sort of a dispute with a guy like that, I said, yeah, you grew. I would worry about, call me running for president. Really? Fuck. Yeah. Yeah. Watch house of cards, son. I know how this game is playing. The next move is called me, runs for president. A bunch of people that get in the room with him. This is bankers and this was one dude who's an internationally successful businessman, but he keeps like a humble lifestyle and a normal house and he likes to bird hunt. Hey, everybody watching at home right here is what Joe Rogan explained to me. How it works in politics, not back to the actual show. Yeah, they do a little too much of that.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       Sometimes the camera, they get away with it sometimes. Here's what I want. I want Claire Barnes to do those every now and then was Claire Barns I Claire Underwood. Yeah, his wife. Yeah. Yeah. I want his wife to do it. I say under what? The second time, but I said the second time. Who the hell's Claire Barnes? Who reporter is that the girl's name and homeland? I've run out of space in my head. I don't have any jumbled together. It is it. They're all jumbling together. 13 Zoe bonds. That's who it is. That's right. Clear under what I want to hear. What she, what she says. Yeah, she's not allowed. Why doesn't she look in the camera? Look, she's mysterious. They have that as directors cuts show him. We network on the we network. It's only the women up points of view they have to or take us chromosomes before they'll let you watch it. You hold onto your remote and test to make sure you're double x? No. Why No? Why we network. Does anybody watch that anymore? Chicks? Yeah. I got some people like hallmark. Nobody really watches either of those though, right? Nobody really watched it. Somebody watches. But nobody really dude go to Nebraska. But like they watch it more than like NBC Day Dvr the shit out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       David Taylor once said he was trying to write, they were buying like dump scripts for a hallmark channel and he said he'd watched a research, a bunch of them and he goes pretty much every one of the movies that work, it's about a pet, um, a family reunion or a holiday. So he had a, uh, lost my dog, uh, Christmas time, a movie that he wrote, try to get, he was like, I'll fill all of this stuff. That's hilarious. Yeah. Those, the, remember that, um, billboard across the street from the store was always the hallmark channel forever two, one of my favorite comments you ever made because it was just like cop show. Whereas to a woman in the front woman behind her. I kinda like Charlie's angels a little. It took him tough like a dude way, way in the back. Maybe three women to one guy, but the other good hardnosed detective and you're like, hallmark channel is Psi Phi for women. Like in what world does this exist? This is, I forget. It's so true. I was doing that on stage for a while. Yeah. Now that I'm remembering I was doing that. I'm saying that on stage because it was right there. A series of fucking billboard across the street. I need you to go out there and look at it. I'm telling you after the show, look at it. This job's going to be better after the show.

Speaker 1:          00:21:20       It really was like, see what's possible and you're like, that is not possible. The guy would be like, give me the fucking gun. Where is he at? Guys like hanging back there. Like he's waiting for these chicks to save him. Fuck are you watch on. Me and Jay went on a rabbit hunt over at his place of looking for videos of women cops getting beat up. Oh God, they're awful. It's like fuck cause a huge power difference here. Oh, disturbing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:48       There's one, I'll never forget this one because the guy's child, it was his child I think, or his girlfriend. I forget who it was. I think it was his kid was screaming at him to stop, stop, to stop. And he was beating the shit out of this cop. Yeah. Yeah. He got out of the car with her and it was a woman and she was really little and um, she was pulling him over and he got out of the car and I don't remember the exact chain of events, but I remember he was punching the fuck. He Kod already on the ground and he smashed in the face a bunch of times. Yeah. And His kid was screaming, I'm pretty sure it's his kid screaming to stop hos. Oh. So scary. But it was like, this is the reality of being a cop. Let, this is why it's not sexist that think that it's a scary thing to have a 130 pound woman on her own out there driving around in a cop car with a gun trying to pull over six foot four.

Speaker 3:          00:22:52       The guy was a stacked looking black dude, like he looked like a big guy and once he got ahold of her and start punching her, Holy Shit Dude. It was awful. It was awful. He beat the shit out of her and he did it super easy. And you realize like once you got it on video, yeah, we want to show a little of a choke us. It's awful man. So this is big dude, right? He gets out of the car and I think it's his look at that. He just punches her in the face and don't get in front of his daughter. Oh, that's what it was wailing on him. Oh Dude. He beat the fuck out of her. Well, she's old. She's out cold and he takes her gut, takes everything in. The daughter is freaking out, dude. It's hard to watch. It's hard to watch.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       Get back in the car. Oh yeah, man, there's a bunch of a man. It's such a dangerous job 10 times. It's such a dangerous job. It's such a dangerous job. And to say that it's too dangerous for women, whose to say that's, I don't know, to quit after that, if she kept working, I think she kept working. I don't know. I think she might have brain damage after that. That's horrific. It's a big dude. And I bet she was twiggy full. Yeah. I mean he's really, and I bet she was totally defenseless after the first punch. So it was just colleen clean punches right to the face, boom, boom, boom. Put me the damage that a big guy like that can do to just a regular female face. What's, I can't with that because daughter too, bro. Oh my God. It's terrifying to be around that kind of violence when you're that little.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       So that's, that's what it was. Why I think that the video showed the kid in the car out of the car. Shit, man, it was terrible. But I mean that's probably one of a hundred of those things that have happened by the way, in terms of if I felt unsafe when I was traveling, that shuts here. Sure. You right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I was known as unsafe. It's like Chicago. Yeah. That's what I say about Mexico. Like people will like, do you ever go to Mexico? And Mexico is like mostly Nice, nice people. They're really nice people. Like Mexico is not the problem. The problem is parts of Mexico border towns, some. Yeah. But it's also like that's the problem. Like you said with the Detroit, that's a problem with Chicago. It's problem with a lot of places. There's spots where it's fucking dangerous. Even most of Chicago's good.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       Yup. But Chicago's great. 550 murders last year, but sick pick how many people weren't murdered to marine outlook. You're a glass half full kind of guidelines of not murdered people running, running, running Chicago. Really enjoying their freedom. So yeah, I mean if it affects you or someone that you love, it's terrible. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. So in all this traveling, did you come out of this with anything, you know, a few things for sure. Cause you seemed like to tell you from the outside you seem like almost like you a had a different purse. You all's each seemed, I don't know man. It was nice to see you when I first saw him when he came back. But you seem like a little different. He seems like you, um, I don't know. You've seen another level of stuff. Like you see you've got another level of perspective from this travel thing that like added to your, your vision of the world, your, your overall world view with a lot of time to think also he goes, you're seeing stuff, you know, certainly as everyone would see out there like poverty levels where you're like, oh, I'm doing fine.

Speaker 3:          00:26:28       Yeah. But not even that, it's more specific. It's just like, I don't know, friendly people and like, yeah, just different versions of it. Plus with travelers and plus really getting to a place where you're like, don't need to do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       You know, after a month of that it's like, okay, you just settle into this. Like, I dunno what's today going to bring Ryan. You know, you wake up and you're just like, I heard there's this cool temple there. We'll go check that out. Maybe those get on motorbikes and go somewhere. I heard there's a cool, you just talked to other travelers and black, there's a canyon up there. It's really neat. Go check that out while you're here. And so you just do. And at some point like you know how when you haven't got enough sleep for like a few days in a row, you got four hours, four hours, four as and you sleep like 11 hours and you're like, I am completely caught up. Right. So like not having any responsibility, the stress level goes down, down and then it's just like waiting in that zero responsibility life for like three months in that level I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       Wow. You know, after the first couple of weeks and it's just like I don't have anything to do. Just like, oh, I'm just like fucking relax man. I would leave a city when it felt like the right time to leave a city. You know, it wasn't even like a regular vacation where you're like, come on, we got to do this, then move right it reservation somewhere. Yeah. It was just like relax and then I could just think about things. My art form in general, people in my life, you know what I want and don't want to, I'd have like moments of just like, hey, take a 10 hour bus. There's no Wifi. No, you're just like thinking for a while.

Speaker 4:          00:28:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Yeah. Tons of moments like that. How did you know when to end it? Um, so I um, I was going to come back for this show. Um, but then I remembered my, my manager, my friend Eric, they wanted to do a show at third man records in Nashville, uh, for the, for the wild west comedy festival. And I forgot about that cause that people ask me when do you have to go back? But travels, I meet and I was like, I'm open to, there was so many people that are just traveling open. Wow. Yeah. That's really common. I mean, three months is like a norm. You have some people in six months or a year I've met, I'm in an Italian girl who was going on her five and a half, fifth and a half years, just traveling five and a half years just traveling. She find jobs every once in a while. Wow. Yeah. And uh, it's just goes where she wants. It's very appealing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very fascinating. Right? That's like nobody writes books about a guy who stays in his town that he grew up.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       The book is about the crazy traveler person. Yeah. It was all over the world and a backpack and yeah, there's three months people all over America doing that. I know there's a lot of tent people, there's a lot of people that like they'll get like a truck, you know, like some sort of a get off the grid tv thing and they drive it around a camp grounds and they camp and they use the showers at the camp grounds and then they do stuff enough for money so that they have gas and they keep traveling around and hope their car doesn't broad. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       yeah, yeah. This girl picked oranges and Sydney for like two months. I had this dude on Chris cage. He walked the Appalachian trail. Wow. Yeah, it's Georgia with animals and stuff. I don't know. How do you survive? You will never make it. You would never make it. What do you mean? Well, you'd never make it. If you're just trying to kill animals all the way, you'd never make it. So how do you even have to be an elite hunter and you still might not ever make it because you're not. If you're carrying that food around, it's going to go bad. You're walking through Georgia and the summer. No, I mean, you know critters credit. Do you not going to get enough? Just really. Yeah, you'll starve. It's way harder to kill an animal and people thinking in a movie, that's, that's what's camp. Get some dinner, dude.

Speaker 3:          00:30:27       It's way harder. It's way harder. Yeah. Yeah. You're not getting, unless you're walking around with several high powered rifles and scopes and you're setting up and know where the animals are, they, here you come when you're walking, you're not going to be able to walk all the way to Maine. Oh, maybe that's your stance. You have to get our heads. Bam. They go to restaurants. Yeah. They buy food. They stay in hostels. You know, they, they have, um, these little, uh, camping spots where they have covered shelters and people share them. Really? Yeah. There's a lot of that too, where it's just like, oh, forget about your, like what you need in terms of like hotels. Yup. That's all out. You need a bed. That's all you need. So some people that carry it on their back, there's a thing called a bivy sack. Every sack is a baby sack is like either a baby Sacra, Bibby tent. Um, they're like essentially like a combination sleeping bags tent. Oh cool. And it's super light pull, pull up. Um, a picture of a big tent. Yeah. That's one of the reasons I didn't go to South America is cause I was like, there's gonna be more camping, it seems like up and down the coast and stuff. Yeah. Like cities. And I'm just like, I don't know if I can camp alone for that long. You might freak out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:41       Be Hard to get a good night's sleep around a bunch of Weirdos. Speak their language. This is what they look like. Oh, neat. So you keep that thing, they, they wrap it up, put it on their back. It's pretty light. Carrie, that was the fucking rain off. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically like just this tiny ass little tent. And like if you were a minimalist hiker, like if you're, some guy was trying to walk 50 miles or something crazy. Like these guys, they try to carry as a light of stuff as they can. They try to go as minimal as they can and that's one way that they do that. Yeah. And then a lot of times I'll use like a little air mattress. Like that dude has a little law. Wow. Blow it up. Don't take up any space. Yeah. Just got to hope it doesn't pop. Otherwise you're sleeping on rocks.

Speaker 4:          00:32:27       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:32:27       It's hard. But that was what everybody did to traveling for this backpack. We just got to make it work. Space was like a a,

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       that's another thing you learn too. It's like I need much stuff. Yeah. You'd go down to like, you know, just the backpack full of hats, all your belongings. Did you buy anything? You got to tow something about? Yeah man. Like there's a real movement right now towards minimalism or where people are trying to pair the life down as much as possible. Yeah. I think people don't want to get involved with like banks and fucking having to like mortgage themselves and their, their lifestyle just for the sake of having things. Yup. When they're like, and so they get into like stuff like camping and hiking. Well it's also, you got to think like what do you really appreciate? What's important to you? Like what's really important to you? Yeah. Cause you don't have forever. Right. So what is important to you? Cause you only have 24 hours in a day, so what's important to you?

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       Find out what the fuck that is and do more of that and try to figure out like how to, how to make enough money so that you're not starving, that you're doing well, but don't just chase that chase what you're trying to do. I did the point system attached to it. The monetary point system, it can get you all fucked up because it'll get you working like 12 hours a day, 13 hours to get what? To get more stuff to get better stuff, to get more prestigious stuff to get stuff that you know all your other stuff. Having friends are really jealous of your stuff. Yeah, just going to die bro. And it's not that you can log term. I mean like what are you getting out of it now that that's what's most important. Yeah, a ton of people that are like, I don't want that shit so I'm just going to do a job.

Speaker 3:          00:34:05       You know, working on a tugboat and Seattle for few months, save up money and then go fucking enjoy myself. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are just choosing to look at everything that they can see experienced every new place that they can go to. That Henry Rollins podcast, man, it's a world changer. That crazy fucker is fascinating. He's a fast, I never met anybody like him. He's really fascinating. He goes and does stuff and see stuff. It was just also is lik outlook, how he simplifies all the things that are wrong with him and all the things that are wrong with the way he interacts with people. And so this is an I'm going to do and this is good. I'm like, you know, like he's like his, his um, story about being given lose a Ritalin was Ritalin right from the time he was like five fruit as a young boy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:54       They gave him Ritalin till senior year of high school. So he was like, I would just be on these pills. I'd be like all day at the end of the day, like boom. He was like crash. And then they do it again. I mean they were dead juicing them up with this crazy stuff from like he was an experimental case he grew up in, from what I understand, he's from Potomac, Maryland, which was same county is where I grew up in. But that was the richer part of town. Um, nothing was a rich kid, but like Montgomery County is one of the richest counties in America. And like that was just a standard thing. Like your kid's not performing. Ideally he's learning disabled. Give me some pills. Right. Crazy that people thought for that was the way to go. I just uh, it just fascinating that he so like Henry so intense and he so like his, he's got like these rock solid test fix and this view of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:35:52       It's very egalitarian, very open, but also very aggressive. Very interesting. This started out though, it's just this is what I believe no matter what. Yes. He was like, Oh yeah, for sure. I thought about this and here's the answer. No, I super enjoyed talking to him. Thanks for hooking that up. I'm glad it worked out. I was gone. But I was like, hi, I got back. I was like, trim it, link up with him. You're like, yeah, we did. It was good. Yeah, I guess like, Oh hell yeah. Yeah, it was really good. He's a, I just love when someone is just soaking in as much as they can get. Yeah. Just out there like, let's go to Bali and he just goes to Bali. Let's go to Africa. Now we're in Tanzania, lauer in Botswana, you know, and just meeting people and going out on the fucking sand dunes and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:36:37       And it's like with Bedouins. Yeah. I mean if you get away from like the backpackers path, you know the tourist path and sometimes it would get like too much, but you just go out and then you can like, yeah, I really see some shit. Like basically what it is. Yeah. My friend Jessie is going back to Liberia. Wow. December. They'd left after it when Charles Taylor was taken over. Um, and so, but now it's safe again, isn't it? Yeah. Wow. And they're trying to convince the world that it's like a decent, like tourist place. But Jesse's going back into town. We're like, dude, I'm coming with you. I'm staying with your fucking family's House hotel. But like let's see what Shit's really like out there. Yeah. So let's see. Yeah, I bet it's a trip. Yeah. Did you ever see the vice piece on Liberia?

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       Vice Guide to travel? Um, and they went to Liberia and my man Shane, he was over there in Liberia talking to this dude who his name is general button naked. This guy was famous for going into combat during the war, but he would take all of his clothes off and he'd run naked killing people. Naked Dude heat. He admitted he was talking about how they would capture a child from the other tribe and they would kill him and cut pieces of the heart out and eat it to give them a invincibility. Like he was talking about this and he's free on the streets and they, they exonerated him because now he's like a Christian minister. Yeah. It's pretty much the only Charles Taylor got punished. Everyone else was like, you're all done. Go be part of the government. It's okay cause this guy like openly talks about all the crazy shit that he did.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       Wow. About cutting the hearts out of children, eating them. You know how Libya was started? Yes. I didn't know that til recently. Tell everybody slave thing. Freed slaves. Yeah, there went back to chip president monroe freed up and said we'll ship you back there if you want. And a lot of people are like, yeah, I don't trust you guys so I'm going to guess I'm going to go back to Africa. Crazy. They never grew up and so they call it the barrier for liberated and that's why they all speak English. It's there is no, they don't have any African language anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:38:44       Wow. Yeah. Monrovia is our capital President Monroe. The idea of it is so crazy. I know. Use the expression too much but going back and starting up a free slaves countries, taking them and throwing them onto a patch of land, good luck. I mean it's like setting out a zoo animal into the wild. Right? It's like have fun surviving. Holy Shit Man. And just talk about feeling displaced and confused. You didn't even grow up there. And how many lions in fucking Georgia and you must be thinking of yourself like what kind of shit? Luck too. I have, I've double Shit La Shit luck that I was a slave and then shit lock that I was thrown back to Africa and to stick. That might've been the way to go. Oh yeah, for sure. It'd be free. Better. Oh yeah, a hundred a semi free post slavery. But I'm just saying like it's still a bad shit luck.

Speaker 3:          00:39:38       Yeah, you only got three cards. The best you can do is three of a con would these general button naked guy turned to dude in because the dude was selling human flesh and he knew because he had eaten human flesh, so he knew what it tasted like. So that's how when he was buying like shish Kabob from this guy, he turned him in. He's like, this guy was selling human flesh. I could tell because I've eaten it before. What the fuck did you just say? You can tell what it tastes like. If I give you a piece of lamb, would you know for sure that was a lamb? I'd have an idea. Yeah, no idea. But I could maybe sneak in like a piece of wild sheep or something. You might, maybe that was, you know what I'm saying? Because this mother fucker, no, that's him right there.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       He went flush. Tastes like that's him right there. A general button naked. Wow. Yeah, it tasted, I got a taste. It was human. I called the police. Wow. Nice. Todd knows what human tastes like, dude. Yeah. Fuck. Just said they went on the test they got when they were testing out like rocket launches to sell them to people there. They will be like, let me show you. And they're just blow up a dam, you know. And so the infrastructure is totally fuck cause everyone is testing out their weapons all like, no, we need that building. Oh my God, that's so crazy. I'd be like, cool, I'll talk. Take him. Well maybe it'll eventually like calm down and be like Australia. Right. Because Australia was a place where they wanted to get rid of prisoners, shipped him off to Australia. Now the best people ever. Maybe that's exactly what's going to happen in Liberia and they just need a couple of generations to knock the dust. Got Rid of Taylor. So there, there should be. Okay. Yeah, maybe that'd be fine. It just takes a while to rebound from some shit like that. Yeah. But Henry Rollins has that of like going to a place and like, let me see what this was like. Yeah, man. Inspiring. There's not a whole lot of people that do it, that's for sure. Yeah. Any works. Like his work ethics, insane. Like I'm talking about his writing and what he's doing and he's always doing something. He was writing columns and you know,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       he's just, he goes and does stuff and then he comes home and takes care of business and then he's like, cool. Took care of it. Go. I think I would do this again after my next special. Yeah. Yeah. He's just going to just every, it's like once you're finished with work, it's like all right, before I start building up again, do a walkabout. Yeah. I Dunno. So you didn't see some of the world. Yeah. Do a walk about, I met a bunch of people doing gap years. What's a gap here? Yeah, exactly. What's the gap year? It's all over every other country. Just not ours. What's that mean? In between high school and college? You're leaving your friends, you're about to make new friends. Oh, take it out of here for a year. In between college and Grad school or college and, and, and your first year of work now is the time.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       Well, European countries have a point in this more relaxed approach. Yeah. To like the future and your life. Yeah. They really do this, this conqueror's mentality. I wonder how many heart attacks we have in comparison to European people. I don't know, but it's like the world. We're not living our lives, you know, Germans get off. How many are you familiar with the, uh, vacation time leave in America? What is it? It's two weeks. Pretty much two weeks vacation, two weeks sick. Do you get paid vacation? Paid vacation? Two weeks. Is that standard? That's the standard. Okay. That's nine to five 30, you know, um, in Germany and most of Europe, definitely all Scandinavia. You get 25 days off, five weeks, Jesus. And if you get sick during those weeks off, if you had to go to the hospital in, in whatever country you're in and you showed them I was in a hospital, you get those days back, they'll kind of get your sick time instead and they expect you to take this to the vacation time too.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       Not like here with like, come on, you can't really use it. You know what's fucked up? Sick time. Okay. I've ran out of sick days. Yeah. Yeah. It's like why? What do you mean? Like you're sick. Like either you're a fucking liar or I trust you now if I trust you, you just really unfortunate. And if I love you and we're friends and we work together, um, I want you to get back, so I don't want you to motto, so, okay. Yeah. You. You don't have to come back to work because they're already used definite 14 days, but you're going to exactly sick the same amount of time every year to imagine telling somebody like, buddy, you're out of sick days. I'm going to have to dock your pay and you, you're dying, but I can't praise ivs and shit. I don't care. You're out of shape days.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       The calendar doesn't say that. It doesn't back you up on the other statistics. In order to keep revenue flowing, it must keep you in the process. You know what? You have a certain amount of days you're allowed to be sick. That's fucking ridiculous. Like hopefully there'll be zero. Well, I'm saving up my sick days. What? You save up your sick days. What does that mean? Like you're your sick days pair of carry over. Yeah, exactly. Get extra days where you can pretend you're sick, sick days. You can save up vacation days, but I don't think you could set up sick days should be able to move them around like cards who? He's give you half of them back. I took four. I've tend leftover. Give me five for next year. People real jobs are so mad at us right now. Yeah. You mother fuckers don't know shit about sick days are work days to be under the thumb of an oppressive dictator offsite.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       It's terrible. Yeah. All these expectations that you never take off. You have to pull your whole life into that shit and it's like, Oh man, go do some stuff. Okay. Let me play devil's advocate because if I was one of the people out there that likes to complain about, should it be like though, it's easy for you to say are you haven't had a job, you don't have the responsibility, so I have. Yeah, that's true. All right. I'll be quiet and a podcast. Not at all. I'm saying though they'd demand better. They get it better and other places they absolutely should. First of all, Haitian that you go fucking see the world and go do stuff for 40 hour work week is bullshit. Bullshit. Shut up that level. Nobody should do it. I shouldn't be standard. Everyone has to do the same amount in less.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       I want to buy something that you make, then could you please like get up and do over time and put it in night shift and give people a time and a half for overtime so you encourage them to go over time? Yeah, time and a half you can get out of the mindset of having to work this time. I just demand something better or more interesting for your life. Well, it's just a weird standard that we've all accepted pretty much across the country. Nine to five. Nine to five. Nine to five [inaudible] morning Bob. Nine to five. It's not a five 30 or six oh yeah. If you want to take a lunch break, we'll get paid for that anymore. You don't know. It's not nine to five anymore. Is that trump? Did he do this? No. No. It's been a long time. Nine to five and Oh shit.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       Nine to five. Could you imagine what a weird, weird decision to make the most significant thing be the productivity. It's pretty new on a month. Where's that horn going off young, Jamie, you hear that? Is it in the back? Just give it a little double check. Go through with a baseball bat, tell him to shut the fuck up, but like walk towards them and walk out there with your Dick in your hand. That way you startle anyone you see. And you always have the first mover. Yeah, exactly. They had to react like this guy's crazy came out with his dick out. Yeah. Like if you, if you're getting ready to fight and you just come out holding onto your Dick, people are like, Whoa, what's he planning? A lot of people would back down from that fight. A lot of people wouldn't, people would be worried that Dick would touch you, but once it did touch you, we realize it really doesn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       But to be the chief people would have to like lean back with their hands forward and try to get as if your punches don't matter. But the dick touching your toes. Yeah. Like he's going to touch you and give you cooties. Yeah. Because the happy, you look at like an electric eel Dick, I gotta pee right here. You know, I don't want to leave. You can use a Kombucha bottle. Yeah, man. It's the healthiest probably. Look, I've done this twice. Really? Yeah. We've done this in the podcast before. Great. For sure. I like the fact that you're willing to do that too. I don't think we could show it on youtube though, so we'll have to, we'll have to move away. Oh, he's got his dick out. Got a big opening. Yeah, so it doesn't vacuum up. How often? DUP DUP. Several Times. Every day. Do you like one of them are healthy water drinker dudes. I pay a lot. Do you? Are you a healthy water drinker? Dude? Interesting detail. This just happened. Oh, you ran out. Don't know. Uh, hold on one second. Jamie. Go to the recycling. Get me something. It's all right. I'm pitching. I've got a strong grip. Everybody. You can move all I have to take it to touch the bottle. A cop, not a bottle.

Speaker 1:          00:48:02       He's like, oh man. It's going back in though. I can feel it starting to swell back yet. That's, that's unhealthy. I've been pitching too long. Should I pay under the cup or bottle yet? Oh, you emptied it. Oh, thanks for that. Oh yeah. A lot went back in and my urethra are, you should fear, uh, couldn't hold in his Pe, ladies and gentlemen, couldn't means wouldn't filled up one Kombucha bottle. Here's a cap there, felon, and then filled it up again. I had to go empty it out for him. Thanks for doing that. I on the front. I didn't want to leave you hanging in there, dude. Really? There was only one solution. I almost went to the kitchen sink and then I put it like, Ooh. Then we'd have to rinse that out and show it would be nasty. Did that bathroom sick is nasty. You're don't have a cleaner in here. No. It's like, it looks like a bachelor. We're on their way out of this. Oh Man. I was like, it's not that bad. You're just got used to it. You've slowly seen it get worse and worse. Gas Station bathrooms.

Speaker 1:          00:49:06       Trying to recreate that here. I should definitely have someone come in and so fucking far nine. Uh, do you, um, do you like doing your podcast? Like the way you're doing it? You just like have a subject? Yeah, for the most part. I mean, you can deviate once you start talking, but you have like a set thing that you wanted to talk to someone about. Yeah. Keeps me focused. And then it's also like a, I get to ask real detailed question myself. I want to ask about, you know, um, and usually I get it with some level of expert, not like the best in the world, but someone has experienced with something, right? Like I'm an expert on standup comedy, you know, I've been one. Right. So if you were doing that, I could tell you all about standup. I know more than most people in the world, you know about hunting more than most people, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Not really. Yeah. But you've done it more than like words in the average person, but people who actually know it. I'm very novice. Right. I'm always aware of it enough to be like, yeah, I know about that world. Yeah, I know. Tell me some stuff about that world. Yeah. So yeah, I liked doing it that way. But then like, imagine if a five year comics started talking about what standup is shut up. But knowing, boy, it does take a lot longer with stand up to like with hunting. Really? Yeah. I'm, I'm a five year a hunter, so for me, I just shut the fuck up and listen to the people that actually know what's going on. Or Parrot, they say it's too complicated. A hunt hunting is a super complicated. There's a lot involved in that. Yeah. But generally it's like Theo Vaughn climbed Kilimanjaro. Teddy really are up to base camp or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:50:41       Oh, he's great. He's so funny, man. Yeah. Yeah. He's really hilarious. So funny. He had, I was in the back of the, or the other night and he was killing me, killing me to a point where I was, I was crying. Tears are rolling down my face. He was so silly. That pit a bit. Uh, yes it did. It did. Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's real funny. He's really funny. Like, if you get a chance to see him, folks, if you're out in the road, unless Ari's in town. [inaudible] was an impression of him for punchdrunk Desi, yeah. Will just come in and sometimes you to do del Ray. He just like, Oh, I'm talking about the yoga. It doesn't so go with that accent heads Larry. I know. That's part of what's funny about that too as his dog scent. He's just fucking great. So many funny guys. They're mad. That's what he did. He stayed at my apartment one month, I think it was an Edinburgh last year. So he stayed at my place and uh, he was like, aw man. All right. I got heavy into coke.

Speaker 1:          00:51:39       It fucking nuts. It's hilarious. Boy, that's a clean better than anybody else's stay there. Yeah, but duck had left it pretty nice too. Yeah. Dot. They kept me out a little bit. Is that I was like talking, you can stand by it because he was moving to New York. Right. Then he was like, oh, don't get an airbnb. Just stay at my place. But I was like two days in when I got out there and I was like, I've made a huge mistake. I should go back home two days. Priya right away. It's so different than him. Like what am I doing? This is definitely a mistake. What, what was the initial thought behind it? Like what did you think? Do you think that this is what I need to recharge? No, I've been wanting to see the world for a while and you know, I had, I had, I had one good, this Guy Turner brought me out to a tour of China.

Speaker 1:          00:52:26       Um, and I just sort of saw some of that place and it was like, just so like the really the meaning of the word foreign, you know? Yeah. Just way different. And they're just like, I just wanted to see more of that world. And I went with, with PDC to Thailand a couple of years ago. Went one of those full moon parties and it just got more like I want to see things. I did a Scandinavian tour last year. I made sure to leave days off in between shows. So like a really see some of the cities, I don't know man. I just get off and like seeing new new versions of the world and new experience of what people care about. Well I think we love to um, to compartmentalize and to like look at our specific area because I think it's a part of being a human until recently.

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       Like until you could travel like this, like what people liked was knowing the sort of security of their environment. They know the environment well. They're around it all the time. There's no surprises. I got this place a lockdown down on safe, but it's not adventurous. It's not adventurous. So this new thing that people are able to do only really within the last hundred years while you could just get up and travel and just, I mean, I guess there's probably world travelers before. Yeah. Before for sure. But I mean how many of them did it recreationally? Like, so easy now. Yeah, you can stay at hostels for cheapest. Fuck, you know, meet people and have them tell you what there is to do where you are or where to go or not go. When do you think that that was really an acceptable thing? As far as, no, no, no. I mean world travel. Oh, like when, when were you an invader? Oh, right. And when did it become okay to be a tourist? I think it was always sort of okay to be like some guy in foreign lands if as long as there by herself and not like an invading force, but if you want to just visit somewhere, right.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       I mean I just wonder how many people did it no steak. Like here's what I noticed in Hong Kong and Shanghai, which our banking centers and the people that would come to the shows, ex pats, Hong Kong, you had more locals because they don't speak English there. But in Shanghai, let's say, and it's like if you're an English banker from London, or if somebody from New York and you took the job in Shanghai, China, like your, you'd have to have some adventures bone to you. Instead of staying in New York or staying in London, you'd have to be saying like, yeah, I'm going to go with my kids or without my kids. I'm going to go fucking do this new thing. And Yeah. I mean, just to want to go do that. You can do it now. There's jobs everywhere. Yeah. My friend William, uh, children's, he moved to me and Mario got a job offer.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       Who's an architect. Wow. So He's building prisons. Prisons are designing them. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But like, it just opened up the army, just letting people, and he was like one of those first wave of people and they started doing stand up out there. Dude, that's gotta be a creepy feeling. Building prisons, something like that. Yeah. Designing them. And now he's doing standup. He, yeah, he did all of his time there. He had the show. I didn't Bangkok. He brought me out there from Emr. He took a trip there and met me in Bangkok. Cj, do you think he's doing comedy to balance out the building prisons? No. No. It just does comedy. He's back in America building prisons. Not that we don't need prisons. Not there aren't bad people that should be locked up. Yeah, that's not what I'm what I'm saying. It's like you guys got to design them so he's going to make it more comfortable maybe.

Speaker 1:          00:55:50       Oh, whatever. Yeah, because that's what make it so they can't get out. That's what it is. The sunshine, the wall situation. It's a crazy thing when someone escaped from prison, Wham, Wham, Wham, and let the dogs who's wherever, wherever I wrote. Can you imagine getting out of prison? Oh my God. That must be so exciting. A tunnel every night or finding you have to find the way out. How do you know the way out? How do you escape? How about El Chapo walks down to the whole that's under his toilet that goes a mile plus in the ground and then pops up at some goofy ass house and gets in a car and drives off. Wow. See US suckers. Is he still free as he know? No, he's back. They caught him of Chapo. They did something and he got injured to something happened to him.

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       He like hurt his leg or something like that through the tunnels. I think he might've like broken his leg falling and they're trying to escape. You know, he didn't look like he was the most fit fella. He's too busy running shit. Yeah. To actually be running. Well we'll it if you can hear this. Uh, July 18th, my netflix special comes out. That's so amazing. Shout out to El Chapo. I checked that out with Chapo. He speaks English and when he would the comedy translate to him? I think some of it would if it would fit after they've subtitles on Netflix. So, right. That's how I always wonder, like that's one of the unique things about like learning a language. It's the way they structure their sentences is very different. So it's, you can't, it's not just this word means that that word means this. So just replaced them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:24       No, it's interesting when you talked to people from other countries, when you're out there and you start to the event, be able to translate their mistranslations easy things like what time it is, right. They don't realize that that's a statement, not a question. Right. But like you just get to like, when they say five years more, it means like, I've already been here five years, that they're not really, so you have to understand what they really mean. Sort of like that 72 virgins expression, what it means. Like it must glowed. Oh really? Yeah. That's what it means. 72 is like a shit load, you know? Yeah. It's not like a specific number. Like we, when we see a few, it's like technically it means three, but really it just means, I don't know. Som mungus amount, 72 virgins. Right? Oh my God, you have, so we all took that as like, you think you're getting exactly 72 virgins, exact glow.

Speaker 1:          00:58:08       Yeah. We don't. Yeah, I used to do a whole bit about that. Seven suicide bombers. What page is this whole 72 of our agenda. Something written anywhere to shop. It's doing okay. I just want to know why can't you just tell me what page it's on. What a crazy world to think that there are people that will go into crowded areas like in Manchester? Yeah, and just blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people around them. But halls or just like belief. Oh belief for sure. And then some sort of mental illness for sure. There's a lot of issues. Abuse, maybe. Maybe there's physical abuse. Maybe they're like have no idea what have an extreme desire to show their love. You just think you were at war, right? Who knows? Who knows why you think you would, you know, to break down the psychology of, so when there's a suicide bomber would be very like you would, you would have to do a tremendous amount of research before you started drawing. Any are hard to find

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       them to talk to them too. That's what already done a problem. The theoretical suicide bombers do not apply. I'm thinking about you have to get guys who, whose best don't go off. Okay, we got to talk to you. Even then, like what are you going to get here? This is a recovered person. They got, they got through that moment where they're going to blow themselves up and it didn't happen. Now they've sort of had a chance to think about it. How do you charge that guy?

Speaker 1:          00:59:44       Yeah. You know? Oh yeah, I would do it again. I realized I was about today. Do you notice a different in, in, uh, in um, uh, deviant sociology does a different category for, uh, people who attempt suicide and people who commit suicide really in the psyche of it. Oh, I see. Because their thing is if you attempted it, he weren't really trying. It ain't that hard to do. You were probably trying to cry out. And the people who do it generally shut up about it more. They just do it without telling people like, I'm going to kill myself. I want to kill myself. So somebody said it. People say they want to kill themselves. That's a good sign that they need help, but that they're not going to kill themselves. Hmm. There's,

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       is there a different, there's a different mentality between also someone who wants to kill themselves and someone who wants to literally be the

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       bomb that kills a bunch of the, yeah, that's a, if you really believe in heaven and you're going there though, fucking great. Get there. Why wait? Wow. I mean, you're for sure going, it's, it's like, you know the Catholic confession on your death bed and then you go straight to heaven, but it's hard to time it, right? Yeah. You confess all your sins right before you die. You're going, shit, you have no sense left. You're going to heaven. Right. But you don't time it, right? Yeah. And that's really hard. These guys figured out the way to time it perfectly. My Act of blowing myself up gets me into heaven by the way. All my sets, right. One shot. Unless as he blew it up, part of it goes, fuck. Right before he died, he goes to hell for eternity to Callis Jamie. No, I don't know anybody from Manchester. I'm sorry.

Speaker 5:          01:01:18       Just

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       what if, what if you do it? What if you do it and you think you're going to be in heaven and you press the button, boom, and then all of a sudden it's just you disembodied and an infinite black room. It just you forever in the blackness of infinite space with no stars, just you alone with nobody. What's floating through eternity. You just, you, you can experience the blackness of space, but with no stars and nothing to look at women forever. Just you just, you just use your conscious consciousness and realizing how huge you fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       Oh, forever. Oh, that'd be pretty bad. He'd go crazy. Right? Then you'd come back, we'll come back and crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:02:08       What would even be crazy? Imagine if you have your consciousness forever. Nothing drove by it too. Nothing to apply to and you're floating through infinity and you don't have a body, so you're not to bad man. That's

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       a pretty bad punishment. That's pretty bad. It's not good. Wow. That would be real tough. Still not good enough. That's you should float. Unable to turn to d while you're feeling like you're choking on Dick's. Wow. Like that's a little for eternity because if you can exist for a second way choking on a deck, you could exist for eternity while he choked it out on deck. Yeah. So that should, that should be the punishment for suicide bombs. They have the simpsons where homer going to hell and then, uh, the devil, one of the demons was like, so you would like donuts? Do you try eating? I'm merely and go nuts. And it's just conveyor belt that keeps like shoveling donut to do his mouth and he keeps going more pleased that he's gotten off that big. It's like please more. Another one please.

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       Oh, you ever do the simpsons ride at universal? Nope. It's fucking amazing because it really, it's crazy. Giant animated ride. You just sit in a car. It's one of the best rides ever. So good. Yeah. And it's all happening on a screen, but the cars moving around so it feels real and it's an enormous fucking really high resolution screen where it's showing this huge cartoon where this whole thing plays out. Oh, it's fucking great. It's really good. The simpsons are a national treasure. Yeah, they really are. It's pretty great. It's pretty great. My whole adulthood, I guess they've been on since I was in high school. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Tracee Ellis, dude. They were one of the first. There's something crazy like that. 30 30 yeah, me too high school, Dude. It's forever. It's always been there. I'll never forget it. I remember like what a great show.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       Remember one, a homer Simpson went to a chili cook off and the peppers were so hot. He started tripping. He had psychedelic trips. Peppers were merciless. The ghost peppers, right? Isn't that what it was supposed to be? The of quit. So sockets a Nunga. What does that, is that what they call it? Ghost peppers and puts a sockets manago grown to the deep and the jug of primeval by the inmates up a Guatemalan insane asylum. Yeah. That was a great show. Caught. Damn. What a creative, see, that's the thing about like bill burrs show F is for family too. I haven't seen the new ones yet. I heard they're great. I heard they're really good. Of course it's great. Bill's Hilarious, but you could do so much cool shit on a cartoon that you can't do in real life. What's the head back it up?

Speaker 1:          01:04:45       But then there's that again. We'll get decapitated. They get blown up. I mean how many times it South Park Killed Kenny. Yeah. So many of them comes back and he didn't care that he came back. He just comes back. I love how later they sorta like dealt with it with like the reincarnation sort of stuff. And he said, I'm going to saying things. Yeah. He remembers all his past lives. So ridiculous. Yeah. I love when I F is for family cause there's a, there's a real type characters and they look real. They don't look all like Weirdo, like uh, like squid billies type stuff. So it's like this is, you can believe as a people and when the father saying to his son, fuck you, it's like a real sharp, oh my God, it's like a cartoon. But in my opinion, like if you got to give, wow, I mean, I was going to say like the all time best is south park, but I don't really think there's an all time best, but it's in terms of they're all awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       I don't want to like say this is number one is number two, but like south park has had some fucking money. I won't miss that show is South Park. I mean for, and for years it's been that you just don't miss any episodes. There is no falling behind. There's no like, oh yeah, it's, I just stop watching a couple seasons ago. It's just like every year I get so excited to see those posters and the billboard now on the, uh, the billboards and the subway. Yeah. And it's like, oh, it's back. It's fucking amazing show. And it's been amazing forever. You have trey Parker on here on this podcast would for sure. Oh, you should. I would. I'd have them both. I'm at, yeah, you left matt out. How dare you, you don't even care about matt the ever see that show. Um, a boy, they show the making of a soft start there.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       Yeah. That's great. Fuck yeah. Documentary. It's great. He's humbling, right? Trey Parker, like his work ethic and the way he goes after it, it's like, whoa. It's like get the fuck out of that guy's way out of his way. It's pretty much sets that you guys come out for a second. What can I do with it this? And then someone would say something cool and then right back in. Yeah. That dude from snl working there that week and he barely had anything to do. Wow. I four was his name. It was hater. What's his name? John Hater. John Hater. But later it was John hit her own Napoleon dynamite. Hey, let me ask you this. We didn't think a Bill Maher. I'd never been a bill Marfan, but do you think of this whole recent controversy of him just casually drop on an Bob? Yeah. You know, he was trying to make a joke.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       Exactly right. Yeah. I mean it didn't work, but he's trying to be naughty. Yeah. That's all. But they're making it seem like it's something more that it's words that, like you said this and said, yeah, said, said not did, did is worse, but it's totally not hire black people is that, that's a major issue if he's never hired a black person. But I don't think I've heard of that. So it's like his actions aren't, we were talking about before the podcast, this thing where the, where they were talking about the Clintons in Arkansas, in the governor's mansion. What, what show was that? What show was it? Did you see Jamie? I read it. I didn't see it on the show. Oh, was getting passed around the Internet yesterday. Mm. I'll pull it up. It's gotta be Russian disinformation. I could be, who knows? But apparently when Bill Maher, when they go like troubling from bill, I mean, I get to even the Republican senator, they was there with, it was like, what? Like I'm a little uncomfortable, but sure. Be uncomfortable. And if a guy, I'm watching a guy who uses words that make me uncomfortable at time, I'll stop watching. I guess. You know, twitter erupts over news that Hillary Clinton used black prison labor while first lady of Arkansas, newsweek.com.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       And what does it have to do with, um, JFK? JFK pushed the Democrats to Democrat running for connecting, pushed them to the right and Hillary Clinton physics too,

Speaker 6:          01:08:27       Huh? I don't know. Um,

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       okay. When we moved in, I was told that using prison labor at the governor's mansion was a longstanding tradition which kept down cost. Clinton rights. She has it. Most of the workers were convicted murderers and she became friendly with, in quotes a few of them, African American men in their thirties who had already served 12 to 18 years of their sentences. Woo. Despite their alleged friendships with these men, Clinton tells her readers we enforced rules strictly and sent back to prison. Any inmate who broke a rule despite having no psychological qualification, she later asserts that these men did not have inferior iqs or an ability to apply moral reasoning, but instead they may have been emotional illiterates

Speaker 3:          01:09:21       emotional illiterates. I don't know. That's what she said. But I like how it says, despite having no psychological qualifications later asserts, despite having no ability to say this, she said, yeah, it's kind of weird though, that slave labor. Yeah, that is exactly what that is. I mean, let's know, but it's just tradition. It's like, yeah, but that doesn't mean he should do it. Let's be honest. Like how much are they getting paid? Zero. What? The fucking one pack of cigarettes a week. Yeah. What did they get? They did not pay inmates at all. Oh, Jesus Christ. Clinton makes no mention of whether or not these men received any money for working for her and her husband at 2016 article for Mother Jones notes that when it came to prison, when it comes to prison labor, some state states include Texas, Arkansas and Georgia. Do not pay inmates at all. Holy Fuck on twitter. Djing wrote that. Hillary Clinton was a direct participant in what? Sam Sue Sway Samsung. Uh, it's at Samsung pay on twitter, I guess correctly described as modern slavery. 100% well, dude, that's 100% slavery if you don't pay someone. And you make them work because they did a crime. That's a crazy thing like boat, but you're making them work. That's what's crazy about it. It's like, it's not just that you, you, you were your freedoms taken away and they lock you in a box, but they also make you work.

Speaker 3:          01:10:50       Send your lives aren't worth anything. We can make it do whatever we want. Yeah. And that dude from a Phoenix makes you work in pink. Oh yeah. That, that Gelato Cryo guy. Yeah. Yeah. He's a, he's an interesting case. It makes you put pink on to embarrass her. Yeah. Do, do you get embarrassed when you were in pink? Epic? Sometimes I don't give a fuck. I'm not a big pink where I will occasionally wear pink. I'll admit I'm not a big pink where, yeah. But at the same time I don't care about it. I'm not scared of a color. I'm a rational person. I remember in high school, like 1314 wearing pink ties and stuff. Like she'll bring a little embarrassed but also been like, this looks good. And then learning the word salmon makes it way more easier. You know, gene, the Belo is wore a pink judogi. Really? Yup. Why? It's clean and sober. It says an all of them clean and sober with pink shirts. Probably because they, uh, were drug offenders. Right. He gets upset. He wants everybody clean. I mean it's better than then they combine sober. Oh, there's an ang and quotes around it, that silly rascal

Speaker 3:          01:11:52       and he's not taken out ever pink. Um, so judo, gene labelle was like one of the toughest men that's ever lived. Did his judo with a pink Guiana. Why? Fuck you? That's why Google judo, gene labelle judo. Gene Labelle was, uh, he was, uh, I know he was a national champion in judo and I think he won a gold medal in the Olympics through, I saw clay Guido see him once and there's real quick what was coming up. So it wasn't like he was in the cheap seats with us. Right. And he started judo gene and like the section, whether you sit and he was like, oh fuck. He just jumped. I don't know how it got past security. Just like ran past them just to go get that guy a hug. What is gene? There's gene, the balance Pinky. What does gene labelle's um, his accomplishments.

Speaker 3:          01:12:38       He said a shitload of accomplish. That's the judo, but clearly on the guy. Yeah, he definitely did some training with Rhonda and he's also the guy that exposed, um, Bruce Lee to grappling. Oh really? To joint locks and joint manipulation. It's, what does it say here? National Champion. So he won the Aau national judo championships in 60 and 54 and 55 North American heavyweight championship. See Nwa. All that stuff I think is like fake wrestling. Oh really? Yeah, he is real wrestling and perfect. Nwa, professional wrestling. Yeah. There's no tag team in real wrestling. So he was a national champion. Is there a real, some reason I thought he was a, an Olympic champion than I might've made that up. Is there a Greco Roman tech team? Uh, no. That's not real. Oh Man. The show. Um, you could see like a, there's a million pictures of him wearing this ridiculous pink gee, how do I not know his, his, uh, accomplishments in judo but, and as far as like a pinky. Yeah, he's crazy. He's always been crazy too. He had a one. Yeah. Yeah. He's a great guy. He had one of the first mixed martial arts fights too. He fought a boxer. Simone said he could, uh, he would go down there with Piper, I guess pipe were trained with them. Um, and uh, he said we'd go down there and get calls all the time for people challenging him. Judo gene,

Speaker 3:          01:14:06       like I can beat you up and he would just answer the phone all day. Just aren't, well, come on. Prove yourself. I'm here. I'll take you. All right, well I'm here eight to seven every day by just saying sound people. I fuck you. We'll come over all with you. I'll beat you. He was like in his sixties and he caught some kids breaking into cars and his neighborhood and a one kid came after him and he just fucking man handle this poor kid. And throw him on the ground. Imagine being thrown on the ground. 65 year olds, 65 year old judo black show. This guy, what's up boy? What the fuck? Yeah. He put two dudes to sleep when they're trying to break into cars.

Speaker 3:          01:14:43       He's just a different kind of human being. It's just like if he got ahold of you, it's like it's guy being grabbed by some sort of a primate, you know? I imagine the pride. It's of your face. Yeah. You just feel so weak. If once you were in the air, he'd be like, how is this happening? Like before he slams your head off the ground, you've got to be thinking, how has he just throwing me around like this? Well, weird specialty. The specialty of throwing. You can become really good at throwing people's bodies around. You'll see that. Uh, did you see that? What's it called? Boom. That's beautiful techniques and given some kid technique off the sideline here. Oh Wow. Wow. That's, boom. That kid has some technique. Oh, so pool. He's like, hell yeah, Bro. Man. Putin walking on the maths, but it's shoes.

Speaker 3:          01:15:34       Come on, dude. Putin would fuck up. I would get, I would bet Putin would fuck up all the world leaders if we had a round robin and then may contest with all world leaders. Yeah. But I got my money on Putin. Definitely the big powers must get out of doing shit. Yeah. He's going to win. He's an actual judo black belt. Oh yeah, Bro. Weird. This looks like this bird. Literally. It looks like it's salutes in back. Should Goddamn Putin bird knows his place. So live on the fucker. So look, well I, that's gotta be fake. How did they bend his wig over? You know, man, the real question with a guy like Putin is not like, how much does he control? It's like, what happens if that guy dies? Oh yeah. Who takes over that power to the vacuum of power behind that guy must be stunning.

Speaker 3:          01:16:26       They're a democracy, right? Russia sorta totalitarian developers, they know they have some sort of a democracy. They have some sort of election process. Yeah. Yeah. It's President Gorbachev, right. Present. As long as you're not running against Putin seems to function fairly well. He just took over again and he like, he was the president. Then he went away. He just came back like, fuck you guys. I took it over again. I think he came back again in 2012 this has been back for a while. Not that long. Yeah. He was gone for a while and then some other dude got into power and he's like, hey man, you're the president and the guys are okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, it's, it's, look, it's not admirable. That's what a

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       guy from narcos did. Right. He wanted to be just in governments. We run shit. Yeah. What was his name?

Speaker 1:          01:18:44       Oh, so if you went up there and eight Dick. Yeah. And then I'm like, have I started losing it? Oh, gone. I'm already nervous about that. I don't want to fucking people like, what are you doing? I'm like, I don't even know anymore. What was it like the first time on stage after that long break? A little weird. I tell the story. So I at least base myself in like in like, uh, things that happened, you know, a narrative, a narrative, less as expected. But then the next day I did a, our gatsy was there and so Nashville, I was at, that's when I came home. So they wanted to do this show in a third man records. So I just wrote them a letter and I was like, Hey, if you still want to do that,

Speaker 7:          01:19:21       mmm.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       Add it to the website. I'll be home. I'll just come home. I'll see it. Right. I'll check it. Um, so I did nate Barr, gatsy and friends the next day.

Speaker 7:          01:19:32       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       and that was just stand up and I was like a little lost was weird. Yeah, I was, it was Russ, you're on the edges and I got to like 12 or 13 minutes. I didn't want to do anything from the special. So I was just like, what do I have new? And I tried something that I thought I've been on the road, which wasn't much. I kind of shut my brain off to that a little bit. Like instead of like writing jokes, but he was like, Nah, a couple of topics. And I was like, but that's it. What if you had an awesome idea that just came to you? I didn't know where it should bother. Right. And toss it. Yeah. I wrote that like, just an idea. Mm. MMM. Like I saw two d this hasn't worked, so to say it. And I saw two dogs at the end of fucking so many stray dogs out there.

Speaker 1:          01:20:06       It's everywhere. It's everywhere. And eventually it ends up on menus to, Ooh. Just cause it's like, it's like fish man. They're everywhere. Jesus. Yeah. Why wouldn't you kill one to survive? Did you eat any dog? I did not. Uh, only because I, when I saw it on a menu, it's called [inaudible] in East Timor. Um, it was like a, they have this, the Indonesian style of food, which is while ruined. So just like windows with like food left out. Do you know how like pizza places in New York, he points to a slice and they'll take it and warm it up. So it's like that, but they don't warm it up and it's meat. So it's like bits of fish or chicken or beef. And then that was like dog. So if it was hot out of the oven, I might've gone for it, but not leftover cold.

Speaker 1:          01:20:50       Cold Dog over rice. You look good though. It looked good. I had ask her four times what she said. I had to keep checking my like translator and I was like, no, I think you're saying it wrong. She was like, yeah, she had an act out like walk, walk, walk. Now that's not a dog. Ruff. Ruff. I just do chicken trying to do dog. My friend Steven Rinella was telling me that they regarded as a hot food. Not necessarily even just meaning spicy. Oh really? A dog is like a hot food. Meaning like there's like there's something to it. It's like there's a special energy that you get from eating dog. Yeah, that's dark. I could say that because they seem more like intelligent, you know, they have seem to have feelings. Jesus hot food, like human meat. You came their souls. He did a show with the sky where they, uh, they shot in eight a coyote, you know, they cook the coyote like they would cook like wild game and they uh, opened it up, they burned off all the hair and then they split it and threw it over like a great and cooked it on over coals just through some seasoning on it and it's crackling and cooking and then they just cut pieces of this coyote off and it's like, I was watching this going to, why is it so disturbing when we choose one animal?

Speaker 1:          01:22:13       Oh yeah. Why is that so disturbing? Like, why is that coyote any different than a pig? Which is totally normal. It's just pet wise. That's, I think it's all boils down to, I mean, you don't have that. You don't have it. It's even weirder than that because nobody's got a pet. Coyote did. I saw something. Yeah, it's close enough to your dog. Fuck your dog and get it pregnant. Yeah. I was like, oh we don't like that. Yeah. It reminds me of it's, it's so close to a dog. It's so close to a dog that if it fucks your dog it'll make puppies. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22:48       I went to a rooster fights that seem so crazy. Does that seem so crazy? Yeah. Imagine if a chicken can fuck your parakeet and make something still pair Katie Kate and gets to the parrot cage. It's fucked the shit out of him. A chicken. A parrot's cage would be hilarious. Yeah. The different species. Yeah, but she makes it look like the same thing. Chicken just shit out of that parent. Oh, that whole time you thought you had a girl parent, you know the chicken laying eggs. Chicken gets in there plug too. Shit. Roosters are ruthless man. I don't have any, I don't have any roosters. But we were really worried when we're getting chickens. Yeah. That when I was growing up but he wants it to go away cause I made it so I had to bring him into the garage every night cause we got the neighbors the fucking middle of the numbers and they're just like, what in the flaws for Sun up? Yeah. It's not set up it's way before it's on up. Really. They can sense it coming. Oh it's cons.

Speaker 8:          01:23:42       Oh

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       yeah. Just screaming next to your neighbor. Like what the fuck? Yeah. We were in Santa Barbara and some guy had one but he had it like thousand 2000 yards away. Really? Yeah, it was far. But you could still hear it but it was kind of cool because you ain't here.

Speaker 1:          01:24:04       It wasn't obnoxious. Like if it was right next door, like it was way across this canyon. I was like wow, that's kinda cool. Like that won't even bother me. I got used to it being out there. All those countries, they just had them around. So wherever you are asleep and they were thin walls, he would just hear him, dude, I want to get peacocks. Cool. We had peacocks. I want to get pet peacocks. I'm going to go full hunters Thompson and have some pet peacocks. I had to bury one of them. Did you fucking reaches head of the lattice work that tried to like eat the grass right outside the Fox. He was waiting for him. Took his head, left the body. Inside foxes are clever. Very clever. I went to a rooster fight in uh, in Timor-Leste day. Did you really? Yeah. In terms of like what we accept and what they will, you know, different things too.

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       They're doing that shit and encino or they really so, right. I know place. Wow. Then you can go to, there's, there's places I wanted to go down for sure. There's places in the valley that might as well be Mexico, like you said, one neighborhoods. I've never seen the actual fights, but I've seen the fighting roosters. I've seen pens. There's a hundred is a dude that I know. Who knows the dude who's got like a hundred of them in his backyard. Wow. Yeah. Quite fighting roosters. Yeah. Wow. A lot of these like Mexican neighborhoods, it's like super normal. They don't view it as weird at all. Where I saw it, they were like, you're not taking pictures. I'm like, oh, I didn't want to like, you know, get your guys in trouble. Like, why did it get us in trouble? What do you mean we're outside in those countries.

Speaker 1:          01:25:27       It's not bad at all. The general owns the fucking ring where they all put to it. It's hilarious. But then if you can do that, then you can justify dogs like, well, what do we do about dogs? Well, dogs are a little smarter. It's a little different. There should raise out there, right? They are straight a's. California authorities sees over 7,000 birds in the largest cockfighting busts in US history. Wow. Jesus Christ took three weeks ago. Jesus Christ in the valley. [inaudible] valley. See, I told you I'm making this up. That's Meth town. Anyway. You say meth town. I say a rooster town.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       Zip. Gasser. Slashers. Yeah. They put these razors on the back of the back claw, isn't it? I mean, they give him steroids really for the animals. We're also recovered. I didn't see any of that. Oranges and steroids. They got juiced up. Chicken's ready to fuck you up. Can you imagine? I want to like do a vice land piece on that. Watch these dudes shoot their fucking chickens up with steroids and have them go out there. I'll look and hulk out 700 birds. They went back to the same spot, but here's the thing, man, it 10 years earlier, it doesn't bother. It doesn't bother you or me like it would if it was dogs. No, it doesn't, but I'll be out. Yeah. No, they don't look like us. Not nearly, but I was. I thought it would be like really barbaric until you see it and you're like, oh, that's not really that bad at all.

Speaker 1:          01:26:53       I've seen dogfights. I was in New Orleans. I saw a dog fight. You did? Yeah. Impromptu. I don't know if I was out with my friends. It was a pit. One fucking pit bull came in and another pit bull came into this pit and we're like, what's going on? And they did it and it was, I mean vicious. It was vicious. These cockfights are just like, they fly each other a couple times and then one gets like woozy need and then falls. It's a cockfight room. Yeah. That looks like why inside? Huh? See the dog fighting thing is the dog fighting thing to those people that mean the people that believe in it. I'm sure they would argue with you that there's no difference between dog fighting and rooster. Probably not. Most people think there is because dogs are smarter. It was just, but it was also bloodier. Oh yeah. It was just like more like them ripping each other's fucking everything out. Yeah. Th Th th th the father fights of 30 seconds and you don't even see blood most of the time it's just, it's just there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:52       But, but yeah, in terms of animal, if I saw a dead animal on the side of the road, what would probably be more of a dog or a rooster? It's on youtube. They have cockfighting on Youtube Cup. Oh, the world's Slasher Cup, dude, I dvr this. That guy's gonna hit the other one in the back to move him or he's going to pick him up and throw him towards the other one. Is that what they did that they're not going at each other yet, so they have to really throw them towards each other. So most of the time if they put a rooster near rooster, he's got, he's got a tight, yeah, they'll come out to each other. They're probably like, what the fuck is going on? So in their back foot, here we go. Oh. Then they go at each other. Oh my God. What will start pecking the other ones soon. So they're catching each other with these feet and that happens a normal way of fighting to say the other ones that blocked that one. That's fuck God. Yeah, he's down. It's dad. They stopped that. God, they must be both mangled though. Yeah. He gets tasteless. Little blood pack had them.

Speaker 1:          01:28:48       The Ref has to choose when it's over. He's called, that's called it. Wow. That rooster got fucked up. They'll fast. That is, yeah. So you don't even see really how it's like barbaric. It's just quick and over. Do you think that well, yeah, because covering a little strap

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       one tonight. Today. Oh yeah. So when I saw the winner or the owner of the winter, it gets to eat the loser. They take it home with them on their bike and they're eating chicken tonight. I went weird. And do you think that rooster fights again? I saw them selling a rooster up. I don't. Jesus Christ, they said he gets two months off, gets to live a fun life for a while and then I'll be back and fighting. But he didn't. So sometimes the winners get, nothing happened to them. Sometimes they get a little fuck to Jesus. Sometimes they both die. Wow. These are the rooster houses. Wow. That's in Kentucky. Hold on. Shit. But wait a minute. That looks like a dog house. That looks like what they do with pets because they do. Is that really roosters? That's crazy. There's a on top of it then place under for the rains.

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       Yeah, I guess so. The places where they, um, they fight dogs. They'll have like a giant yard and they'll have like 10 dogs plus out there on chains and they're all connected. These little tiny houses just like that. It's really creepy because they're, they're not really dogs. I mean their dogs in the sense of they're at the actual animal. They are his dogs. But there are these things like at all, no, there's no pet to them. They're these things that had been there just bred to fight and I'm sure that they can handle them. You know, I'm sure there's like a few commands they understand, but their life is not about being pat and love climbing on the bed. He's army. What's, what's their name? What do they call? Jamie was one with the tickets cut off. Oh yeah. We'll just call play is trying to fight their Unix, but that's not what they call themselves, but I don't really know.

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       God Damn it. Yeah. Fuck that. She needs to come back. It takes a while. This ansel and sally the unsullied. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what those dogs are there. Like ansel. Hmm. Yeah. Well, they just, they have their dicks and balls though the unsolid. The problem with those guys is they've been neutered so they can't fight that good cause they don't have any testosterone. These dogs have everything there ready to rock and roll. They just live to fight and that, that moment that they get to fight, it's like the only thing they're looking forward to and they were brief and like really miserable existence. So the more they exercise them, the more they just train them and get them ramped up. They're just prepping them for this one moment where he gets to do what he actually wants to do, what he's made to do in the side of his fault.

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       It's like that dog is bred that way. They've encouraged that behavior like generation after generation, like careful selection calling dogs that don't fit the criteria. Like it's one of the reasons why people love pit bulls so much. Like once you have a pit bull, other dogs seem so dumb because they're so smart. They're so tuned into you and they're like, like I remember squeaky fromme. She was like a little demon. She was like tuned in to me and she would lock onto me, but if any other dog got anywhere near her and tried to take my attention, she would kill it in front of me. Really? She would just want it dead. It's like get the fuck away from him. Like Shit. Yeah, they just, they're very intense and tuned into you and a lot of people like it. Well she, I got her, she was already, she was a pound dog.

Speaker 3:          01:32:04       I got her, she was like 11 months old and she was cut up. She had, she had definitely been in some sort of a fight, whether it's an organized one or something, but she was a mess from the moment I got her. She was just such a cute little dog and loved you to death. Just couldn't, couldn't leave you alone. Want to sit right next to you. I'll put her head in your lab. Just a big sweetie. Just the sweetest dog ever. But like these eyes, there's like the, they had like, I'm ready to die for you eyes so that the one you had to put down. Yeah, the rest. Killing my other dog. Yeah. Yeah. It's not good. Fuck yeah, there, um, the nature is not their fault. I mean they, they've, they've essentially been selected over many, many, many, many generations to be incredibly dog aggressive and incredibly prey driven and almost impervious to reacting to pain.

Speaker 3:          01:32:57       That's what's so terrifying about them is that they don't care. They don't, they don't, they like to fight. They're not worried about getting hurt. They looking forward to this. They want to do it. They're wagging their tail and they're biting each other. It's crazy. They wag their tails, they're locked faces on each other and their tails are wagging back and forth. Like they're having the greatest time. I saw a thing for some like, oh see county fair. They train their dogs new tricks and shit and they said they've gotten to the point where this reminds me of this, where the treat they get for, for crashing the frisbee eventually becomes the Frisbee. So like they're trying to catch like, cool, I got to grab that Frisbee. Thank you. And that I could throw it again. So like I got through about the Frisbee again, you know, instead of like I get the Frisbee so I can get this fucking piece of meat.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       Right, right, right. So it seems like those dogs too. It's like, Oh, I did the task and thank you for letting me do that. Yeah, that's what I wanted to do. They get those. I'm working dogs. You ever been around like a real working German German shepherd? No, dude, there's so intense. They'll look a live wire. First of all, they're like a real big German shepherd is probably like, I want to say like 90 pounds. Like let's Google. What's a big German shepherd? It's not the hugest dog in the world. They're not like a mass deaf, but they are so fast and there's so taught just like fucking ready, ready to go and looking at you. And this dude was a demonstrating different, uh, he's a, he trains dogs for the police department. He was demonstrating different things. 71 pounds is a big one. Oh, adult male.

Speaker 3:          01:34:34       88 pounds. Say Yeah. Close to 90 pounds, attacked by one of those were in a suit once. Dude, it's so strong. Oh, there so strong. They just keep regular in your hand until you're on the ground. They're just so, they're so fast there and you've got to think there's so fast. They're on you. They let him go. Like jump now think that right. That's a 90 pound animal. Now think of a wolf double. Oh Wow. Double that. And have it more athletic, stronger, much harder bite. It was seen a wolf in the wild. No, almost. I think I might have, but it was, it was so dark. I could only see that it was some sort of a dog, like creature that was running across the dirt road ahead of us while we were in hunting camp waiting to get picked up. Whoa. Yeah. Nervous.

Speaker 3:          01:35:18       Yeah, a little bit. Yeah. When you're standing outside in grizzly country and there's wolves, so you can't wander off to go pitch no fucking way. You're off to be together. You have to be together and you both have to be paying attention and you should talk and since it's out, it's late at night. You don't have to even worry about whispering. Like you're not trying to, like, you're not trying to scare anything. You're trying to let things know that you're there know. Right. So todd, I surprised by it. Not surprised by you. They hear you come in, they can avoid you if they choose to, but if something decides that it's going to come towards you, like cause this size, these wolves. Damn Dude, if you saw a wolf in the woods, I wouldn't even be trust avenue. Trust. That with thing was dead. I'd be like, ah man, at this size of these things, wow, these are enormous wolves.

Speaker 3:          01:36:02       The dead one, the one of the top middle. And you know, it's really interesting, these wolves that you're seeing, although they're all just wolves, these wolves are wolves from Canada and it's one of the reasons why they're so big. One of the reasons why they've been so devastating to elk populations and deer populations that was got deer in his mouth. Half a second leg is the leg with the, ah dude. He looks thin too. They're so powerful. They're just incredibly powerful, incredibly cutting killers that act in packs. I love the snow. They love it. They can do shit in the snow where other animals are fucked. Like they can run through the snow. They thrive and ridiculous cold environments because that's when the other animals are vulnerable and they can wreck havoc on them. There are crazy animal man if, but they look like a dog.

Speaker 3:          01:36:51       So we have this weird connection with them where we think of them as dogs like fits our friend. It's mister [inaudible] the same way. Exactly. I mean they do look nice. Yeah. And when you'd see him alone and you're like, Oh, if that was, you know, with no scale off, if I can remember, I'll tell you this bit I'm doing about it, about wolves. Cause a real encounter I had with a dog and a wolf or a dog met a wolf for the first time. Oh really? Yeah. I'll tell you later. But it's, it's um, that animal is not the same animal. It used to be here. They killed a bunch of wolves. So they had to reintroduce wolves to try to bring the population back. Oh really? Well, when they reintroduced wolves, they brought him in from Canada.

Speaker 3:          01:37:30       Canadian moves her bigger, they're Canadian. People are bigger. It's like it's a polar bears. It's a fucking hardier climbing up there, man. You get a different, different sort of an animal. Oh, you got the wrong one. They got a big ass wolf. It was way bigger. So you can't ever just like go off because they'll see, they'll wait for you to be alone while they definitely could if they chose to. Most of the time they avoid the fuck out of people. They seem to know that if they fuck up and do something to people, then will it start coming and then everybody dies. Like they're smart enough to kind of understand that they are not smart. Like they wouldn't, you know, they wouldn't do anything that you would think would be extraordinary from an animal. It's not like they have like superhuman powers, but they have an unusual ability to plan and coordinate and they talk to each other. They yell out and talk to each other and they, they give locations and they all kind of intuitively understand what the task is. But when they're operating together, it's like, it's pretty stunning to watch, man. I've watched a bunch of videos. I never, never in real life obviously, but a bunch of videos of them coordinating like an attack on, on animals. Dude. It's amazing. Like

Speaker 1:          01:38:35       we heard were I had a um, which campsite? Malleable Creek State Park. You heard coyotes or wolves. Coyotes. Um, but I just liked the way they were like sort of talking to each other too. We saw a skunk or first we s we sort of smelled one and we heard to coyote is kinda like yelping and we're like that they got sprayed by a skunk. Wow. For sure. We're just filling this and we have no idea. But it's really seemed like that hearing them or like just a couple of them. And then later we saw skunk, um, tried to spray us, didn't have much and we think that's the same skunk that like sprayed out and now he's got nothing left in the tank. Does that work like that? I don't know. This is what we all think. And then like a little bit later, um, it's just kind of kind of like came with us but didn't like he tried to spray.

Speaker 1:          01:39:20       Got the dog. He's stopped my friend Mervis as you know Mervis a yeah, they got his dog but just like a little bit just bid it. No, just like with a little bit of like spray, but like not much. Not enough where it's like terrible. It was bad. And then we heard like 10 or 15 coyotes all howling. Don't want you to write this concept. Predator. Yeah. He was coming out with bared teeth and stuff. I had a skunk trying to get into my chicken coop. Really? Yeah. And then I read about it. I'm like, that's one of the things they eat. They'll eat chicken. I make sense. Yeah. Yeah. That's the sprays for self defense, not offense. Wow. But they'll fuck you up. I just fucked up by a skunk. Like you fucked you up and you smell like shit.

Speaker 1:          01:39:59       Heal your wounds. It, nobody wants to help you. Yeah. I mean, imagine if like you got a fist fight with a skunk in your backyard and he's Zaps you and then bites and fuck out of here up and rabies. He jumps over your fence and you run inside, you're covered in blood and you're like, oh my God, this skunk bit the fuck out of Wesley's out of here. Get away. Didn't even know she doesn't even care. Oh my God. You have to wash yourself outside. It's cold outside. Get Out. You saw like skunk. Oh my God, I'm never going to clean this up. Oh my God, this house didn't smell like forever. I'm so mad at you. I'm Gee, you're mad at me. If I got fucked up by a skunk. [inaudible] skunk biting your deck. It's a skunk. Oh, you're like this. You love fucking creatures. Or my trip, I saw Komodo dragons. Ooh, in the flesh. Yeah, out in the wild. You went hunting though. Like not to like kill, but just to find them. Yeah. I try to touch her tail to what I found out. Not supposed to do that, but

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       I didn't know a man. I was really close and I just touched one. No you didn't. Oh my God, dude, that's so scary. So we're walking away and it was like, it's so close. And I was like just grabbed. Oh Yeah, they have these guides is weird. Pointed like v sticks like long sticks with like a little tip at the end that like Kinda like, it's weird. But this one guy, when he had it was like way into snakes and reptiles and shit and he's like, let's go. Let's go find him. We went out into the brush. Komodo dragon was the inspiration for that thing that the alien would do from the movie. Really? Scott movie, Alien. It would open its mouth and all the slime and everything. They have all this bacteria, their mouths. Yeah. Like it's a bit, you're going to still going to lose your leg.

Speaker 3:          01:41:33       We've gone over this at least twice and I always forget which it is that they used to think that it was a toxin and now they think it's bacteria or they used to think it was bacteria and now they think it's a toxin. Well, I wanted the bacteria. Yeah. It's like a botulism, lots of different types of bacteria in their saliva and it's toxic and they know it. And so they'll bite an animal and fuck it up and then they'll follow it around. So I was reading this thing about a water buffalo that this Komodo dragon attacked. They saw it, bite it, and then it followed it for like two days. Really just waiting for it to grow. So this button, this guy I met and uh, it's somewhere deep in. Okay. So it's the island of Flores is where you can sort of like b and then that's where the hobbit people were.

Speaker 3:          01:42:15       Flora's yeah, in Indonesia. Yeah. Really? Yeah. We, you mean the hobbit people, this little hobbit people that they discovered. Oh really? Dude, they discovered that within the last shit, I want to say 14,000 years ago. Is that what it was? It was in the last 14,000 years somewhere. It's somewhere in that range. Humans shared time on earth with another kind of human being. It's a little tiny, three foot tall human being that had completely different features than us. Yeah. Really Contract Homo Floresiensis or Florida. What's that? 12,000 years ago? Yeah. Okay. That's nothing 12,000 years ago. Like I'm, I mean I'm trying to imagine plus as long did they were, those people were just like us 12,000 years ago and they were a tiny little thing. Almost like a, like a cross between a human and a chimp. They don't really know exactly what their skin color was.

Speaker 3:          01:43:07       What did it look like? Put it next to a drawing of a full grown. Like now, man, he's shredded and he's jacked. He's got, I'm going to fuck this whole perfect muscles. Doesn't it ever eat fast food? Troll some Dick and this little critter. Wow. There's even, there was even speculation that they had eaten humans or attacked humans. Do you think they bred with us and that's why they're shorter out in Asia. How dare you know? That's what it looks like. See that one, the drawing and the far left Jamie with the guy holding a spear. That's what they think you live. If there's a full size version of that and see if he could find that. Oh Jesus. So they, these were like all most like what we were like, I guess when we were on our way up the food and they just developed a chain.

Speaker 3:          01:43:48       Yeah. Well all three Australia kiss or something like that. Like one of our earliest ancestors. Australia. Yeah. Well Australopithecus is like a modern human, but like the one of the first versions, I think, I want to say it a million years ago, but I'm probably just making that number up. But you know, human beings in this form, they don't, they don't know the exact number obviously, but they think we've been around in this forum for only about a quarter million years. Give or take a few little dragons have venom. They do have. Okay, thank you. Okay, so the use of thing, it was bacteria and now they think it was van. Okay, I'll show you his picture. I was, I saw it one way. So I went on a rock and you'd go like right behind like some bro, like uh, like some leaves and like some, some branches. So you get an up close to him and it still sort of scary cause you can probably get through the branches but probably not, you know, and you could just take a picture from Mick that close all this Hawaiian was coming out.

Speaker 3:          01:44:41       Dude, I show you this at the store one night. Can you imagine the horror that you would feel if a Kimono Jag and was clamped down on your calf? Yeah. You felt all that hot poison going into your body and you were trying to get away. Yeah. And you, you broke free with a big chunk taken out of your calf and it's a bad about to leap on you and you're trying to run away with a limp hobbling duane screaming no and no. And running through the bushes and you look back and you see it just taking its time, walking, coming towards her, taking its time because it knows it doesn't have to chase you just tracks because you can't, you can't go far. You're all fucked up now. So it oh yeah, they are. And you know, eventually it's going to catch you sick and shivering and it's just going to start eating your asshole first.

Speaker 3:          01:45:29       Yeah, they, they just bite them in the legs and shit or they got to be careful. They don't get stompy smells with his, with his tongue. Jesus Christ to use a tongue to smell what? A creepy fucking creature. A jetson. These, these, these buffalo, they're not natural to the area they've been added in, so they don't know what the fuck this, oh, they've been added into feed 'em. Yeah. Oh my God. Shit. But they died. They'd say go to the watering hole and the Komodo dragons node, they're going to go to the watering hole and they just fucking wait for him. And so he jacked him on the leg and then he slowly making his way towards him. Imagine if that was you and you had to see that thing walking up the bank towards you. Some guy got killed. The boy, I'm a person, you're not supposed to eat me.

Speaker 3:          01:46:10       I can think and I can reason. And I'm progressive and I have health insurance. I have two credit cards. They be killed. The kid, I have to call someone, don't eat me yet. I have to make a call. Hold on, let me get this task. Don't hate me. Yeah, I have to choose my face. Eat me. I'm checking twitter. There's a bunch of them around that one. Just go an ass hole first and you're feeling all the blood rush out of your body while this creepy lizards chewing on your butt ate everything except those, those bores heads cause of the horns. Really. If they get bored, I mean an ox. If they get a bore, they finish the skulls to Jesus Christ. They, the skulls and

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       everything. So just those fucking what the called heads are the only ones left because of the horns. What thoughts come up on the inside? So they eat the bones. Yeah, they killed the kid. They just stomach out. He went to pee, but alone and they're like, oh, this one's by himself. So this guy I met in floors and deep Laura's, his guide found a board that had been bitten and was dying and the bushes. And, um, so he was like, Hey, you guys want to see some shit? It's, his board is kind of like, ah, like this. The Venom, it started catching up and he took them, he dragged him to the watering hole and he threw it in there and they just ripped to shreds in front of them. He showed me this video he made. It was so fucking cool. What does it look at the size of the bone?

Speaker 1:          01:47:26       That guy's eating? Yeah, they're all on [inaudible]. Oh my God. Look at that. There's something about them. They're the cold, unfeeling look in their eyes. Like when he opens his mouth and you see all those teeth alive. But that I, yeah, that's a real, an all black. That's a thinking creature that's trying to eat you. It's trying to eat either you or a buffalo and eats a water buffalo man. He doesn't use knives. It's not using and there's no fork. There's no bullets. It's eating a goddamn water buffalo. So we're going through waist high grass trying to find these things and then you see one pop its head up like the zone, et Cetera, et cetera. You got to like get behind it and try to like force it down the mountain. But there's other ones around so you got to stay closed, keep your eyes up.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       It was pretty cool, man. Do you would love that? No, I read the monsters like that. You would love that. Fine. I'd be terrified. I don't want to be around them man. Why are you around them? Oh it was so cool. Well I found out what I was in Bali and I was like, I'll probably go to somewhere else from there and this guy met from Jakarta was like, you know, you're right next to the Komodo dragons. You can do that. And it's like what? That's here and it was just a couple of boats and you're fucking there. Wow Dude. Fuck that. No Man, you don't love it. They almost got Sharon. What's her mace? [inaudible] Sharon Stone. Sharon stone's husband. Rarely. Yeah, even they almost got him. He was a newspaper man. He was a like a reporter and, or a journalist or rather, and he went to do something in a cage with Komodo dragons and he had socks on in the fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       Thought it's white foot. It was a zoo and he went and got him. What do you mean bid his foot bit the fuck out of his foot. Dude went to the hospital. Crushing his toe. A thrashing it's body around? Yeah. Um, what he had to undergo foot surgery. Oh, come on son. Yeah, I was a shoeless foot. Oh, I thought it was a sock crushing his big toe. Ouchie Wawa. Oh. The zookeeper asked him to remove his white tennis shoes to keep the five foot long reptile from mistaking them for white rats. So, hey yo dude, take your shoes off. You'll be cool. Don't worry about it. As long as it knows. And then they attack that foot. It's like, why don't you tell me to take the shoe off? I really still had a shoe on the feeling you must've had. As that thing is biting his foot that's here must been like, I'm really sorry.

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       My severed the tenders. They had to reattach severed tendons and rebuild his big toe that was crushed by the dragons jaw. Jesus, you have to piss again. Yeah, but do you have enough room in that? Do you want to empty that? Come on, man. He sure. Yeah, but there was only a little bit left cause I had to pitch on again. Overspill don't overflow. I want to repay in professional at this man. But here's the thing about animals like Komodo dragons and wolves. I love the fact that they're real. It's one of the things that makes life fascinating is that there are these ruthless merciless predators. Jamie's shielding his eyes from Laurie's deck.

Speaker 3:          01:50:28       Oh, the image. Why don't just put the image on me for a sec is educational. You don't want to show his, Jamie, could you get away with doing this on, on youtube or instagram where taking might be in trouble just because we mentioned that your opinion, that level of censorship on the Internet. Here's the deal, dude. Do you know that if you whipped your dick out and took a leak in front of a school, you'd be charged as a sex molester? Dude, I do that all the time. And thank you for telling me because I will stop. Yeah. For Real. Like if, say if you're walking past the school and you're like, ah, I gotta take a leak and you just innocently walked towards a patch of trees and you piss there and someone from the school calls the police because you had your dick out.

Speaker 3:          01:51:04       You have your Dick says that the school doesn't matter. Guys. You know I was doing, I know a dude who got charged with that. I know somebody who, we both know. Somebody who got, who's hooking up with a girl on school property late at night. They needed a place to pull over so they can fuck in the car. Oh, what's was on school property, but it's fucking 2:00 AM, you know? Yeah. They're trying to discourage that robbery. Yeah. I get that condoms thrown out the window at a fucking, she has to get showing up for school in the morning and drop your kid off. You could slips, breaks her hip because she stepped down a condom.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       Those a little shiny school shoes. The kids were with the hard bottoms, don't get good traction. What? Like rules about doing stuff within a thousand feet of schools. Yeah, stuff like that. So many schools in Hollywood, you gotta be so much shit happening within a thousand feet of them. Wasn't that one of the issues too with pot shops like yeah, I fucked with them too. I can't be anywhere near a church. The church parts. How Larry this, it's like if that's really the case, does it, is that one? If that really is still the case, but I get it though. If you really believed and you really believe that your church was sacred and important to you, you wouldn't want like one door down no door, but you not sign. All churches are not, they're not the ones. I'm like that with the lawn. It's like you see in the movies, a lot of them in in la or just like in between two apartment buildings.

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       But also the question is who gets to choose? Who gets to choose that? Like what? How much distance between a church and a liquor store? Well let's, I want to know is selling liquor okay. Is it okay? It seems like it's okay. It seems like a lot of people are doing, it seems like a lot of people are buying it. It seems like we all agree. Okay, so if it is the case, w w why that radius radius of a, not even like up blog. The rules in Detroit was the same shop saw also prohibited from operating within a thousand foot radius of a church school park, liquor stores or other dispensary or or a drug free zone such as a library. Hmm. They all somewhat close by 8:00 PM other dispensary liquor store, other dispensary. Okay. This is all this is a result of people got, well I didn't want them right next to this while I'm doing that, but this is saying that they can't be close to a liquor store.

Speaker 3:          01:53:12       Like a liquor store is the same as the church. That's what I'm saying. You were saying a pot, a pot shop can't be the alternative to a business that's already established. Oh, like a liquor store. That's what they're saying. Don't quit booze. Yeah. Well they saying you cannot wait. So the liquor stores must've lobbied to have that put in there. They must have figured out a way. Zero Liquor Store Union liquor board. So yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean there's obviously that doesn't make sense like the church makes sense. Reluctantly I get it. Makes Sense. Makes Sense. The liquor store doesn't make any sense. Know like why can't I just walk right next door after I buy some weed and buy a beer? Why do I have to go 500 feet further? And they don't have them here, but no. How'd they still drive through alcohol places? You just driving a car?

Speaker 3:          01:54:03       They haven't been Phoenix, Louisiana. Yeah. This place is, we can drive through and get, they'll give you a mixed drinks. Mixed drinks. Yeah. That's like how you're going to justify it. I'm not, I'm having the drive thru bar. It's my a passengers drink. Well I wouldn't drink and drive officer and Louisa. I don't think I looked that up. Your drink, your passengers can drive, can drink, can drink while you're drawing the driver. Cantors and Louisiana is on another level. New Orleans is on a totally different level. Yeah. Will you with me in New Orleans, we had this driver, we didn't know we had this driver who's hilarious, funny fucking dude. I wish I could remember his name, but he was cool as shit. We had them for a couple of days and a, when we're hanging out with this dude, he was telling me that he got pulled over outside of New Orleans because he was walking down the street with an open beer, I forget where it was, some other city.

Speaker 3:          01:54:51       And uh, they pulled him over and he had two beers in, in a paper bag and when they're pulled him over, he was talking to the cops, the cops like, where are you from? And uh, he's talking to the cop. He pulls out the other beer and cracks it open and starts drinking it. And the cops like, is there something fucking wrong with your head? And he's like, what? He goes, wait, where are you? Where are you from? He goes, New Orleans. He goes, oh, okay. Oh, you don't know. That's not allowed out of the bushes. Do that anywhere else. And he's like, for real? He's like, why I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just walking. I forget where the trashcan was, what he was outside of New Orleans for sure, but he was saying that they, that he had no idea that you couldn't crack open a beer and start drinking in front of a cop when he's asking questions.

Speaker 3:          01:55:30       I had done nothing. That's the best about Southeast Asia. You get a beer with your walk with it like a fucking free America. You're just like out there. You're not going to do anything. Have a good time, man. Just too many dumb young dudes that would bring drinks and him on people and be walking on the street with open beers and be goofy. I guess so maybe just here, maybe here, but London's got a little bit of that. They drink outside. Nah, maybe not in this trace a drink like an outdoor pubs do. I've seen it in England. Would people boozed up on the streets? Yeah. Beating the shit out of each other. Oh yeah. I mean that's going to happen. It's like don't put yourself in position where you have to fight all the time. What the argument is for. It's not about drinking outdoors or not.

Speaker 3:          01:56:08       It's about like don't drink so much. Right? Yeah. Don't get so drunk. Decab and you can do that in one space or you can walk and do it. That doesn't matter. I wonder what the argument is for a 2:00 AM like cut off time. It's all Christian Shit Dude. Is it? It's all remnants of Christian Shit. Who Cares? Why can't we just be up longer? Miami, it's like 5:00 AM and New York. It's four or later. A lot of places it's not. If that heard they're gonna change the La two to four. Four. Yeah, I heard that will make change. That comment store super weird. They'll stop close it too. You don't have to until then. Why? Yeah, because there's guys who want to go up a good point. We didn't have some weird ass shows, man. I might do a 2:00 AM set. If they ever do that, I might.

Speaker 3:          01:56:46       I might book myself for a 2:00 AM set to the comedy cellar. I go a lot after 2:00 AM two packed rooms. Yeah. Packed. I mean like what time of those show starts? They start late, I suppose. Start at like 1130 and I'm up at like one 45 to wow. And it's just like, and it's all great crowd. Yeah. Yeah. If those are the kinds of people that are up. Yeah, sure. Come on. Yeah. There's a lot of people that are on different schedules. A place like New York, you can find 150 of them go at 11:30 PM and I can start my night. Oh yeah. And you're still have a great long time. Oh yeah. Yeah. And people in New York, like, they fucking go hard. They go so hard, so much drinking in New York and meet people at their show. It's not like, give me a number. It's like, let's go somewhere right now.

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       Yeah. Let's just go to a bar. There's 30 within walking distance. Yeah. Let's keep going. Let's just talk. They just drink. You know, Dunkin had, um, Greg Fitzsimmons on his podcast this week and, uh, I've only listened to the first, like 10 minutes or so, but a Dunkin was talking about how different New York is in terms of like diversity and all the different colors each other. Yeah. Yeah. He's liking it. I see it a couple times. It's been pretty fun, man. Just be able to like booze up and like, not to worry about getting home. Yeah. He loves it. I walk home from the stand. He takes a cab, you know, it's in the normal, you know, he's a, is he living in Brooklyn? Living in Brooklyn? Of course he is. That fucking hit. No, that's right for him. For sure. That's the spot. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he was a silver lake kid and then he went to, he's doing the same thing.

Speaker 3:          01:58:14       He seemed like Williamsburg. Right. I think park slope. Same Shit, isn't it? It's past like, it's over gentrified. Oh, that one's gone too far with style. Can afford it. Ooh, I like it. I might move in. Yeah. That's my style. Yeah. Um, I saw, I was watching one of those house flipper shows. Yeah, it was uh, you know, what is the, some of the real estate million dollar listing, that's what it's called. Million dollar listing, New York birth defects. And um, they had a house that was for sale in Brooklyn that was like a, they built like a Georgia mansion in Brooklyn, Brooklyn in like 1920. And they, you know, they were trying to like put mansions like southern style

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       mansions in Brooklyn. It's like 11,000 square foot house. I can't afford Williamsburg. Really? Yeah. I thought I had to go there cause they won't be able to afford Manhattan. And then I found out when I got there I'm like, oh no, no. Manhattan's cheaper now the cool parts of Manhattan where I live, it's cheaper. Jesus and the cool parts of Brooklyn. Why is that? It got this. Gentrification has his path. At first you have bad neighborhoods. We're not talking about warehouse central Pike. That's different. But like, you know, ethnic gentrifying first to have actually both. So first you have criminals or warehouses and then the people can like are cool artists who have no money. They'll move in, they can get a giant loft for basically nothing cause you gotta worry about getting stabbed or having nothing around you. They start adding the arts to the, to the area, making it more interesting than people like Dunkin and me come in, what we're like, we like it.

Speaker 1:          01:59:44       I'm going to be the front lines of this shit. You know, I need someplace to go like you know, get some food but they're still criminals around or like lack of stuff. And then the rich people who don't have style of their own, they move in and Co op the other people's style and then you start getting too many like coffee shops and then they start changing the law to drive out the people who lived there. Like, and this is a park where they all are camped out and go on us. And every Sunday they would cook out there and they started saying, the rich people was like, oh the smoke is going to my windows. So he started making laws. About how you can't have cookouts and that pretty much just drove out the people who wanted to have that as part as their life. They were just like,

Speaker 3:          02:00:20       you don't make the laws saying it's illegal to be ethnic, but you make laws around it. Do. There's a, there's a park down the street from here. Yeah, we could go to, it's like only a couple of minutes away. Yeah. And if you go there on the weekends, it's, it's like a festival. It's like people use those barbecue grill to have out there that gets, then they set up a picnic tables. They lay out a, uh, a cloth and the picnic tables and paper cups and shit. And they got coolers at porn, like Koolaid and shed and they, they're cooking all kinds of different things on these, these racks. And there's like maybe five, six families spread out in these areas that are doing that. And then as kids are playing and everybody's running around, it's a lot of people that live in apartments that don't have a lot, like they don't have, they don't have a big backyard.

Speaker 3:          02:01:05       So now they just go to the park. It's great. It's great. And there's like this sense of community, but he's laughing. They got music playing. People are drinking. Yeah. Are you allowed to drink booze in the park? How's that work? I Dunno, I don't tailgating you gotta use cans. You can't use bottles. But if you're sitting there on a python, Kenya, I think just look the other way kind of stuff. If anything, that would suck. I mean, you gotta be able to have a beer, some beers, you having a cheeseburger and the park. That's how I meet. Some of these freedom laws are like, I'm not going to do anything, man. Let me have a beer with my family. This doesn't hurt. Well, if everyone did that,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       you're going have drunks, my kid. But that's not me. I'm not that. So let me do it. What kind of diseases can you get from one of them? Park grills, who's cleaning that grill through? One of the best barbecues I ever had was on top of in Vail, on top of the mountain. So we were skiing, I was skiing with his chef and he had a bunch of fucking chicken in his back marinating in the of the sags are those boxes? These ziploc bags? Yeah. So he's kept shaking it up, his snowboard and hitting jumps. He's just marinate in this chicken and then he's like, hey, you want to eat with us? I'm like, yeah, sure. He's like, oh no. I was going into the restaurant party. There's no out here and just use that thing and it's just make grilled fucking chicken up on top of fucking wow.

Speaker 1:          02:02:17       The rockies. It was so good. So did he have like a little grill in his pack too? Oh, they had the public grill up there. Oh, that thing. Yeah, just got some wood and stuff. It was just coal's going, I guess. Oh Wow. People would like to do that up there. Those things are so nasty, so nasty. It was like the bird shitting on them. Nobody's ever claimed anywhere else, but like, I guess the idea is once the fire gets going, nothing's going to stay alive on it, I guess. Yeah. When that motherfucker gets red hot to the point where you could see her a steak, nothing surviving on that. I mean that's, isn't that the whole principle behind cast iron pans? Like you don't really wash a cast iron pan. You don't, you just sort of scratch out. Everything's dare throw some water on it.

Speaker 1:          02:03:01       But like that dark blackness that you get from a cast iron pan. I don't know why, but when I cook on one of those I feel like a fucking man sign grill man. It's about, I feel like a man in frying pan. I feel like a man, if you give me a choice and there's a cast iron pan and some bitch ass fucking heats the whole take on the skin. It's one of those ones that you could like flip a cheeseburger without putting in a non stick. Those are so gross. And me and Martha Usos nonstick pans and now a lot of that got into your food cause they'd been cooking that shit for like 10 years on the scratch and just cooking. Just fucking, here you go and you're like, ah, shut off to it. Let's go. Just date it. Yeah, it's going to come out and metal flakes.

Speaker 1:          02:03:42       My dog ate a packet of glitter. Really? And he shit. Yeah. Shit. Glitter. It's like in roped up in his shit. I was going to take a picture of it, put it on Instagram, but I was thinking it's probably like they could probably take that down. Get mad at you for shit. I guess. I bet they could. I bet there's rules. You can't show tits on instagram. Why on twitter? It seems like you could show people fucking this guy stop bro says comedian. He, he, he's a fat guy. Fat, cute Greek guys on my podcast this week. But like, uh, again, I thought it was he to take these naked pictures. He just liked his big fat naked body. If somebody see but never dick. And he would just be naked with like one foot in front of the other. They were hilarious pictures and instagram was like, Nah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:28       Wow. It's like, come on. How rude. Yeah. People wrote blogs about him saying he's be like body, body positive. Hmm. Instagram picture is accounting. Accounting bring back stabby baby stabby baby. Stobby t a fucking marry your brother's ones. Yeah, they're funny. Um, you just see a butt cheek. You don't see like his asshole or anything like that. Nothing wrong with 20s doing, come on instagram. A sad picture with fucking ice cream over his, over his dog. He dropped one. Yeah, he's funny. It's funny pictures. Why would that be offensive? Like scared of nakedness. I had one way to pay off a bag of bets on punchdrunk ag of Bats, but we put bets in a hat. And so when you have it like, uh Oh, I think so and so it's definitely gonna win. You know, I think all of those other, what I think the other guys don't think of went and you're like, well let's, let's pick out of the hat.

Speaker 1:          02:05:21       So you have to do whatever the bed says. Well doctor do wear a diaper for 24 hours. No shitting anywhere else or pissing anywhere else except in the diaper. One change. One, change a diaper. Yeah. So I had, I would have to Piss in one and I did it in the, in the, in the shower and I took a video of it and youtube was like, nope, no loud. Wow. What do you mean naked? Wearing a diaper fully wearing. Hmm. I think youtube is like super, they're super worried about being able to put ads on things, you know, and being able to uh, keep things. It's lame though. It should be free. I agree. But who's got to pay for that infrastructure son?

Speaker 1:          02:06:03       Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I guess so. It can't be showing people fuck. That would be what? Youtube not be cocky. Okay. Not Fuck you. Attrition. I care. You care. Be Fruit. You're absolutely right. 24 bit yet absolutely should be able to show puffery. Show some suck. And parents you want to put some blockers on there? Go ahead. Do you know the story of a, that Guy Vincent Gallo, the actor? No. Made a movie called Brown bunny. Oh yeah. It got fully got full head. H and M. Chloe's if I get to close seven g and g every scene name. Yeah. And she just blew him on camera. So she's second wave of gentrification when she comes into your town. You know, it's about to be, you're still on. It's cool and hip. But the Wall Street people are going to come into the second wave. Yeah. What's first wave artists?

Speaker 1:          02:06:49       Poor artists who that's they therefore to put up with a crime. Right. And then they bring the coolness factor to the area. You know, they use the whoever's living there, the indigenous mm. You know, cultures. Yeah. Like what they're doing downtown La. Right? Exactly. Yeah, exactly. What does that shirt, what does it say? Oh cool. Blue rebels. Cold blue rebels. You know Tandy Lucas sound guy in the minerals. Oh no shit. Yeah. I love Danny. It's a, it's a Zombie Zombie. A rockabilly. Tommy. Billy, I guess. Zombie rockabilly. Yeah. It's pretty cool band. But I think that break it up. So what's next are you should fear, well, so I've got this netflix double special. No, I'm good. Um, July 18th and building my new hour. Oh Shit. Let me get back on the road and see more places. I want to see more things. Um, yeah, everybody, it's going to be a great double special.

Speaker 1:          02:07:47       It's would be really cool now when you're writing your new shit, like when you're doing it now. Yeah. Are you incorporating experiences that you had when you were on this walkabout and now you love it? I love the term walk off as well. Oh, you physically writing them or are you like having these stores that you trying to work out on stage or, I do some of that but, but my new hour is not going to be that. So that those will be like side bits. Um, mostly I'm, I'm kind of hearing what rollins said too about how he does it and it's like, oh, some time to process it, you know, use it as like references and things instead of like bits about that, you know? Right. You know, we have like such as a tag line about something and not the whole bit about something.

Speaker 1:          02:08:27       Right, right. Um, so just in terms of like, yeah, I incorporate it when it comes up, when I start thinking about it, bill bursts out at once where it's like with cigarettes in a long time ago. Like how do you write a new album? Like what, what, what's, what do you write about, because I don't know what's on your mind, what gets you angry, what gets you like riled up when you talk about it to your friends, whatever that is right about that burst. Kind of an interesting thing going on too because he does that podcast where he rants. Yeah. So he just, it's just him ranting. So his, his like ranting muscle and his ranting. Good. Durrence it's incredible. I tried to do that in my intro, so my podcast a little bit. Your intros. A great, thank you. I appreciate it. Really good man.

Speaker 1:          02:09:05       I really loved the one about Tom Cigar and the baton has expensive tastes bow and very funny. And that was your first one back to yeah, look towards it. Look at that left going like the choice of me out of here. I cannot hear him. Narrations and those things. Those are some of my favorite parts of your podcast. You're breaking down things and getting excited about things. Your enthusiasm for these things. Yeah. I tried early on to realize like, Oh, this is where ads go, so I don't want to make it just addie. Right. But like let's make an actual more content and then if you have to throw an ad in there to a fine, but like he was going to be some good times as well. Yeah. And sometimes I don't even have that. They still do fucking 25 minutes. Yeah. Why not? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:45       Why not? If it's funny, if it's not, I'll be recording our funny and it's also, it's a different thing because you're getting a chance to see you sorta unedited, just ranting. Just, just thinking about stuff and talking. Yeah. Somebody told me when I had one after Anderson loss for the first time and it was just part of a podcast about this girl cuts herself. We'll talk about that. But like in the, in the beginning it was almost an hour on what Anderson silver met Tamir was a UFC fan. Wow. And how would he, it was just this weird way to lose and I kind of forgot about it now, but it was like, yeah, yeah. I Dunno. It's fun. But that went on for like so long. Yeah. Well that's was something that was a real thing to you. It meant something to you and that's why it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:10:26       He was at my first UFC, he fought Chris Leben my very first UFC. Yeah. I saw him become a champion. He was like my guy. I was at the fucking five and a half, four and a half round. Crazy ending. Yeah. To uh, to jail. I remember being in a ring with you and Dana and a and M fucking superman. What's his name? He won two championships at heavyweight and light heavyweight ready to get tour. Superman or whatever his name was. What they call, they call it the natural whatever. Yeah, that's Super Man. Fuck is he talking about? He looked at me in a way like, I definitely got the wrong name, but whatever it is, trying to figure out what nickname, like who had the nickname superman. Yeah, but we're all in just a ring and it was like we're all talking about whatever stuff and then one at a time, one of us, you could see them like thinking about how that fight ended four rounds plus of dominance by one guy and a last minute fucking triangle out of nowhere to keep this one of the best champions of all time.

Speaker 1:          02:11:21       Still in power. Yup. It was just so fucking nuts and you'll see one at a time, randy or somebody, I remember Mandy doing f for someone else did it. They would just kind of go off like you seem to thinking about something and they were just like shake their hand, go and you're like, oh, you're thinking about that fucking fight. It was right in the hallway right afterwards. Yeah. God, it was crazy. Yeah. There's a unique feeling that you get when you're recounting like a crazy event where someone knocks somebody out or chokes on the hour. Jesus look on your face times after the fcs and we'd gone to dinner and be like, Fuck Jesus Christ. And I saw a burger at that same look after at the comedy store in the front, after the baby bird don't go in there. I saw him from far away talking. I was like, Hey, are you talking about the Bay Birdie? Cause yeah, I could tell. I could tell the way you're doing it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:08       Yeah. Yeah. So that's all I'm working on. Just building my new hour and then I can get the fuck out of this garbage dump again. Just garbage dump Los Angeles. That what you're saying Hollywood. How dare you. How dare you? This is the place where you've buttered your bread, sir. No, I like it. The business I ended up, it makes me a little mad sometimes. The business side. Yeah. I think as p or had friended and advisor, I wouldn't say it's time to remove yourself. The other side, you no longer need. You negotiate. So it's fun to travel and stuff is what I made do. I think you're right. Oh, 100%. Listen man, you'll all get along way better when you don't need them. Yeah. Everybody will be your friend. Yeah. Um, but anyway, yeah, that's all I'm doing. I'm working on a new, I'm just gonna do it all about Judaism.

Speaker 1:          02:12:54       All about Judaism. Think so. Well that's a good way to alienate the white supremacist. Yeah. Asshole. You don't even care about the people hate the Jews. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry guys. A bit culturally insensitive. You're not even thinking about them. Know where on, we never found that video of the evergreen professor throwing his hands around. Oh yeah. There's one video. I'm pretty sure it's in, but I need to like double check and listen to make sure it's the part they're talking. Okay. Sent it to me and I had, they sent it cued up like right where it is and it's, it's so hilarious. There's probably, you know what I queued up in

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       a website, if you Google Evergreen, uh, at what does he, the president ever gain Pr. Oh, I'm in evergreen hand. Motions are a micro aggression. Google that emotions are a, and they have it. There's a website for sure that as an article where they show the video and they have it queued up and when it's queued up you can see the kids laughing when they get the teacher to put his hands behind his back. Well, see it. But that's them not understanding what they really are looking for. There's a part of it feels like, ha ha, major do it, and another part says that's a microaggression. Don't do that. Where it's like, if you believe that, that don't laugh at someone for not doing it anymore. What they're doing is just enjoying power. These kids have taken over the school, right? Yeah, that's it. Okay. Gimme some gimme some volume

Speaker 9:          02:14:26       that's not appropriate. He's apologizing. Walks up to the presence, like put your hands down,

Speaker 3:          02:14:46       puts your, got to with his hands to his side. Yes. Dude. And they're laughing at him.

Speaker 9:          02:14:54       Pastors were slaves and your ancestors were not. Your ancestors came here. I'll free choice and decided to bring along my people. Oh, they're not out their own. Free will to work and build this country who's really letting you know that slavery still has repercussions in society today and that is what we're here about. Three per classroom.

Speaker 3:          02:15:20       She went in for an applause over. Thanks. Yeah, she seems to not know. Oh there she goes. Trying to get off, but what does he do about that? He's clapping as well. He's clapping too. He needs a, he needs to seriously stop. He's clapping too. Like he had a really good point. You can't sing something. We know. We already know that about, you know? Okay. The version of that, that super liberal left is the feminists, you know that version of that. There's a version of that which is just the feminists like that version of feminists. That erosion. Yeah. There's like this version, this version of masculine too, right? This isn't built right I guess. Is it though? I don't know. I don't really understand. I don't know. It seems to me like the alt right for more, more than doubled. A lot of what they're doing is having fun. It does seem like a troll. Like some of it's like show straight trolling is a lot of it is yours todd. I can't believe it. It's like, can't you believe it? Well, maybe it was a job. I mean like Milo, Milo Yiannopoulos. Surely that guy gets him so mad. Yeah. Milo is so like, it's so, so much of

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       what he's doing. It seems like he's having fun. I love it when they get on somebody and you just like shit on them a little bit. They get like someone's a god to them all of a sudden beyonce after lemonade, things like that. And if you shit on them a little bit, you could get people so fucking angry or, you know, it's great. It's great. It's never been a time like this art fair. We get so many morons mad at you. I love it. I love it. Um, but yeah, but it's, what I've noticed is that all of the Super Liberal, okay. You know how like American sports fans are kind of dumb. How dare you, you know, not all the leads I'm hearing Moreso that other places we're not very thought out. Rude political like analysis. Isn't that smart? No. Same way our liberal left our feminism is some of the demos feminism in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       Like other ones are more thought out and more interesting and more like just thoughtful in general. Dude, I think you left America and became a fucking turncoat. That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing a bunch of bullshit. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think though? You should hear people talking. They're way smarter than the people we have. Like, like, so our people are just dumber saying this microaggression shit. Right. That's us. That's having too much fucking free time. Is that, what is that? As you've left behind what's actually wrong and you're jumping on, which is a lot. There's a lot wrong. Yeah. So like worry about that and calmed out. Mike Goroka show you guys, it's not like this better shit to do, so you shouldn't worry about what actually bothers you. This shutting bother you. Right. You know, take that same venom and put it into something that's actually happening.

Speaker 1:          02:18:02       There's this forced, okay. But like that girl, that circumcision, the girl that's set up there and it's like your ancestors were not slaves who were brought here at mind were, you know, and slavery has repercussions and then everybody starts clapping and it's like you are, you're right. But what is the point? What are we doing? Like, yeah, it's all obviously ancestors. Like when do we get over this ancestor thing? Like how many generations in do we do we just treat people as individuals and as people, it's nice. What do they want? Some people got an advantage for sure. White people got an advantage for sure. But it's not, it's, it's, it's more so, but it's not 100% of the time. So if I came from, uh, from, uh, uh, divorced household, I didn't write, you know, and my dad wasn't around and my dad beat my mom, you know, that can be a way worse and harder experience then the cosby kids.

Speaker 1:          02:18:50       Right. You know? Right. So it's like, just because you're this, it might make the odds harder for you, but it's not 100%, but there's an origins thing. And one of the origins that every black kid has to face when they think about it, is it someone down the line was a slave and they're not slaves anymore. But that's why people who look like him are here. They're all here because someone brought them over here in chains. Yeah. And there's still true with remnants of that. Right. And there's some, there's gotta be a weird self esteem or a self identity issue attached to knowing that everybody knows who your ancestors were. Slaves. And there's

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       a certain, like there's a certain thing that people do when someone has something and someone else wants it.

Speaker 4:          02:19:35       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:19:35       You, if you have a, a group of people that's different, it's like really easy to almost think of them as not you. Like that's how they've justified wars. That's how so many people I by dehumanizing the other, you know, and this, this thing that has to balance out that I cass is, I guess just the echoes of that. It's like we have to get so many generations away from the, from people being slaves and any repercussions of it. Socially I cannot, we have to get so far away that it doesn't factor anymore where we don't care. Okay. That's well expressed for sure. Yeah. I like that.

Speaker 3:          02:20:18       That kind of like calm way to explain something. Rarely gets put out and of course screaming and yelling. You know why? Like you're not teaching anyone anything. The biggest problem on the left and the right, but the ones that are angry, the angry mobs is they never seek to educate. They only seek to like punish. Also grandstand. They want to make this bigger here in that lady's voice, she was going for audience. The audience clap two, three times, didn't get it. And it was like, I'll keep going. She's seen Oprah. She knows how to manipulate a crowd. She knows how to get those people riled up. Yeah. Well listen man, that's part of being a person. Like that's half the reward for saying something that's right is the love that you get from people when you say that it's right and they recognize it. And they go, yes.

Speaker 3:          02:20:58       So people get addicted to that. Yes. So they constantly do things that they think are at least perceived as being right and they get very vocal with things when they perceive those things are going to get a very big reaction for standing up against them. And it becomes this moral high ground, sort of grand standing peacocking sort of a thing where they just are constantly trying to let everyone who know how uncool it is to do this and how wrong it is to do that. Like settle the fuck down like weird, weird thing. And then sometimes they'll see something that doesn't quite fit in. Like they'll sit there was trying to make, you know how they make rape a broader and broader and broader. Oh yeah. Which was really does think does a disservice to ripe it does to be able to make it seem like anyway, there was some coercion is rape where if you talk someone into it, yes, that's right.

Speaker 3:          02:21:47       And then a bunch of men was like, oh well if that's true then I've been raped a bunch of times. This is the super liberal left. It's like, oh, we don't want to make that. We were on wanting to make you be able to evict them, so okay, that's no longer rape. Coercion was one, someone under the influence of alcohol, which was very questionable. That's a weird one because we all know that there's different states of mind and that a woman who decides to get how to get a couple drinks and then wants to have sex if the man is sober and it was a weird one. It's supposed to be that you're not supposed to do it because she's under the influence like that was, that was the argument that was be opposition to black and white. So it's like I know a lot of women who were like, oh, I can't have sex without, I have to drink before I have sex.

Speaker 3:          02:22:27       And it's like, oh, what's so then, okay, it's a split. Said they don't all think the same thing. Of course. So some of them, the militant ones want to say you're a rapist now, and some of the other one's like, no, no. Women could take control of themselves. They can have some drinks and lubricate themselves if they want to. It's also really the only time we're ever asking people to the, like we're saying like you don't have control, right. You're not even responsible for what you're doing as opposed to like driving. Like if you're under the influence and drive, like no one says, hey, it wasn't your fault that you plowed into that school bus full of kids with your car because you were drunk, but used to be the rule. You couldn't control it. Well, it still is the rule, but I'm saying like it's, they'll say that if it comes to sexual intercourse, but they won't say that it comes to driving.

Speaker 3:          02:23:09       Like no one's going to say you couldn't consent to being behind the wheel. You were under, the influence is not your fault, but you're supposed to know enough. Like it's supposed to be deeply embedded in your head enough that you don't go into that car and started, even though you're drunk, but sex, you're like, no, no. Yeah, that was, you can't handle it. Yeah, you can't handle it. You don't know what's going on. It's like desperate drunk driver. You ran over somebody while you were drunk driving and they're like, I'm sorry officer. I was like, you know, self defense. I was drunk. Same Shit. Right. I wouldn't do it on purpose. I didn't do it on purpose. I was drunk. That's why I lost control the car. Obviously it's hard to control the car and you're drunk. Right. So that's what happened to me. When did it become illegal to drink and I don't know. I don't know. That's a very good question. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         02:23:47       I look that up. We're not too long because it sees my peers, my friends and whatnot. They did it. Or like in the 70s or

Speaker 3:          02:23:54       like what your thoughts on it? Let's Google it and find out. Liberal. Let's take a guess. I say fifties fifties I 61 that's how late in the fifties I'm going to go with 69 okay. This is fun to say that. I think I'm wrong. No, 73 73 that seems so late. Maybe. Maybe. Hmm. I feel like I should stick to the sixties

Speaker 10:         02:24:18       first state that adopted any sort of law was New York in 1910 but um,

Speaker 3:          02:24:25       port we off. I didn't know what that car is that I feel like when I looked this up before I thought cars like late twenties people were drug two years into having cars don't get on your horse. It's hilarious.

Speaker 10:         02:24:38       Remember looking this up, I think like if sometime in the fifties or sixties or maybe even as up to like 1980 when mad started data, the states that weren't adopting it, we're going to get stopped getting funding for federal road ladies like that. So they had to adopt all the laws. That's like how they forced everyone.

Speaker 3:          02:24:54       Dude, of course people would drink. It would be a bunch of people drive. But have you tried driving yet? Dude, it's awesome. And the sun was like, have you tried to drunk? No, I'm for sure going to do that. Sounds like a great idea. See that's where a horse is superior because the horse isn't going to crash because the horse is so bought a pilot. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's almost like a form. You pass that on top of it. Oh boy. Here your form of travel and a lot of ways you have a relationship with this animal. You know like you up to hey there, mister flapjacks or whatever the fuck his name is. You pat them a good old boy and we get you some feed and give you put the feedback, chooses food like what the fuck man. That's probably a way better way of getting around as long as you're not allergic to horses.

Speaker 3:          02:25:35       Yeah. That's why I said, well, if you're allergic to horse in the West, too fucked you're living here. Not a fuck is a person allergic to horses. This is how weak our gene pool has gotten folks. Yeah. That's sad. I feel sad. I feel so bad for people that are allergic to animals and people that are allergic to pollen and people that are allergic to a lot of people close to me have allergies. It's, it's so hard to watch because it's annoying like that, that there's a thing out there that can do that to them. Like what the fuck is that? Doesn't even make any sense. And it's not that, it's not the thing. Self defense mechanism. Now it's dumb. It's like grass. Some kids are super allergic to types of grass. There's kids that will um, like they have celiacs. My kids are friends with them and you know, you have to be real careful that they don't eat anything that has any wheat.

Speaker 3:          02:26:23       Uh, if they're going to tell you this brief, careful of it become too much friends with them now they have, they can eat or to your home. They have to very strict science is, yeah, it's crazy. Real super strict diets cause they have an allergy. I've heard about your phone gets all hot things happen to you. Did it? How much is your fucking straight like peanuts. Like if you have that like two rows behind you in a plane, you're fucked. Brian Collins Mom, he said on the podcast he was talking about if she eats Brazil nuts, she gets like terribly ill. Well I got the resilience of ones that gross though. They're not that good. They're big. Yeah. They ain't shit big. They ain't shit macadamia nuts, macadamia, Damian. But nobody's putting Brazil nuts and chocolate the fuck out of here with that big stupid not big stupid weird tasting that you didn't have to buy a shoe and you eat that piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:27:15       You've got to fucking give me half of it now and half of it later. If you have like if you told me Dude, you get a pass on one nut for the rest of your life right off the bat it over show that, think about it. Yeah, like I kind of like walnuts. It's an unusual dry flavor at that weird once in a while with some salt on them. Imagine if there was like some on yeas for nuts. Same way there are for like ones like sat you down and was talking to you about the cashews he's about to serve as a cashew from the Himalayas. You could open a whole restaurant called these nuts.

Speaker 3:          02:27:51       Joe, I got to go take pictures of my netflix double specially called double neck. That's what I hit.

Dude had his fucking finger right under the rim. I kept thinking of just going to go forward. So he had a touch your asshole. I was bleaching it. Yeah. What does he look? He had a glove. What? This guy looked like. Uh, can I class? Can I guess? Sure. I would guess the Diaz like, um, like limp and plants and botox and just like an oddly shiny forehead. And He, um, he's got a perfect haircut and he's, he's very feminine but in a weird sort of way and he's just rubbing and he's a suit on and he's just, he has white gloves, their white gloves, like with the lines in the back of him.
