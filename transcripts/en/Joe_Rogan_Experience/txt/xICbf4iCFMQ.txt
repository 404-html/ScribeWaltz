All buttons. That is how, right? That's the tricaster. So we're in HD now. Your beautiful baby. You're beautiful. Look at you. You're beautiful.

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       Oh fuck. I need hair. Him. Where's my hair and makeup?

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       What's going on, man? You fucking savage. World Traveler. You're the most savage world traveler. I know you're the do. And I'll get a text message from you and you're in fucking Bulgaria or some shit. You're in North Korea on some wacky cell systems. The communists. You, your, your

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       well, what? I didn't text you from North Korea because they won't let me. But, uh, yeah, I was just in Antarctica and the South Pole. That's hard to get to. Very hard to get

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       do. You were one of the, your special was one of the first things that I ever saw on North Korea that made me like really start to investigate it. Like I knew that they had, there was a lot of human rights violations in this horrible, the things that they're doing to people in prisons, but I want you going to those fake restaurants and having these people take you around and trying to present you with this image of what North Korea is like. Like oh, it's just like everywhere else coming here. And you were like really, you know, talking about it pretty openly on camera while you were there. And that made me really like start to look into it. And this is before all this shit has gone down with the interview of course. And before the poor people really, I think like after his dad died, that's when people really got a sense of like, well this is not going to end here if this crazy communist, this is like the last real crazy communistic

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       tater. Yeah. Like the old school sort of Utopian Communist, a cult of personality. Their God there, you know the president, they're the, they're, you know George Washington there, everything. And uh, yeah, it's still going on, which is is crazy. In fact, they, they pick Kim Jong UN cause he looked like his grandfather came in the song and so the people were like, oh, you know, they're the same guy kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       It's so we, I mean I was always, I'm one of those people that uh, I'll get something on my head and then that will be stuck in my head for weeks and weeks and weeks for a long time was the Mongols and people like to, but you just shut the fuck up about the Mongols and I wouldn't see that movie. Mongol. Yeah, I did. So good. Pretty good. So no, it's really good man. Marco Polo on check it out. Yeah. It deals with cu black Kahn. Who's like the descendants, the grandson of of Genghis Khan. Yes. Yeah. I suppose I always had gangas Jengas but then I got into North Korea after your show, after watching you and that restaurant calling like weird short raid. This is the government's putting on a charade for journalists. And also I was thinking like they fucking, they kitten have people like you go in there and do and that was pretty dangerous. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:20       There's another film. Um, we, we interviewed the woman actually, I think they just sold the rights were they're making the film. It's a crazy story of, um, there was like basically the Orson Welles of South Korea. So after the war they had this crazy film scene going on in South Korea and there was like the Orson Welles and like the hottest start at their Marilyn Monroe basically. Right. And there were husband and wife and they ended up getting into a fight and the wife goes to Japan, she's crying, she's pissed off, she goes to Tokyo, boom, disappears. Right. And it only can find, or what the fuck's going on. So he goes to Tokyo, boom, he disappears. Now it turns out they were kidnapped by the North Koreans, right? By Kim Il Sung. Yeah. And so they had made this film studio, which I actually went to. It's a complete replica of 20th Century Fox back in the 50s and they make all these anti American films.

Speaker 2:          00:04:15       Anyway, it turned out that the woman who key kidnapped, he turned into sort of a a sex slave and the star of all these North Korean propaganda movies, cause he used to make a ton of movies. They get the husband and say, now you're going to direct her in these movies, right? They kidnapped him in Tokyo. And he said, fuck you, I'm not going to do that. So they had put them in a concentration camp, which a Korean concentration camp, maybe the worst place in the world. So he's eating grass and he's being tortured five years, right. Five fucking years. He's in this concentration camp. Finally he says, okay, I'll do it. I'll direct the films. So they let him out and he goes to Kim Jong UN's palace. Uh, and then all of a sudden, uh, there's his wife and his wife all of a sudden realizes, holy shit, he's a alive be.

Speaker 2:          00:05:00       He came to get me, see, he's been in the concentration camp and he realizes, oh, she's been eating shrimp pattern all day. Fucking GIM junk. He'll, while I'm in the concentration camp, in any case, they get together and make like seven movies, big movies for North Korea. And in fact, one of them called escape, no joke, called escape get wins. A Moscow like Oscar, like a Soviet Oscar at the time as a reward, they get to go to Vienna, which was their dream because it's where the third man was, was uh, was uh, filmed. He then, and she [inaudible] their tour of Vienna. They get their labs. We were allowed to tour of Vienna. They defect and they get out. And finally they, because they escape and then he, they told the story and now they're making a movie about it. So they're probably going to shut that. Whoever puts out, I'm just going to get shut down to fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:53       That is the craziest story. Yeah, true story. Yeah. Can still live like that. I mean that's, that's basically the same as people lived 5,000 years ago. I mean, Shit, kidnapping, Peter, forcing the wife to be a sex slave, forcing the husband to a concentration camp, torturing him, starving him.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       Yeah. It's completely insane. Whenever you, whenever you start dealing with North Korea at a, in any level about anything

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       crazy as fuck, it's just amazing that it's still around like that. Yeah, it is. She's such a, it's such an archaic idea. I mean, it really is. It doesn't fit in what we think of as 2015 the modern world,

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       although it wasn't that long ago, you know that you had style in his Russia, you had Maoist China, you had Hitler's Germany where people just went, Yep, that's the dude. He's the one who tells us how to do everything, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       But it's, I think it's really disturbing because it's happening now and even though like 40 years ago or 50 years ago, isn't it really that long ago? Right now it feels like that could be us.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       But I think if you look at what's happening in Russia's not so far away, because obviously the, the, the thing about North Korea, which is weird, is it's like going back to 1938 you know, it's like going back in time. But the thing about rush, if you go to Russia now, they're like, there is no economic crisis. America did this to us, the oil is falling because America did this to us. It's, it's total cold war rhetoric. And, and, and Putin is, you know, the news are, he's, he's, he's taken over all power and he, you know, he runs the press and you know, he runs everything and, and it, it, it's definitely not going forward in Russia. It's going backwards.

Speaker 1:          00:07:31       Yeah. He's a weird case, isn't he? I mean, it's just so blatant that this guy is a dictator. When you see what happens when there's any sort of dispute over there, and even with these oligarchs takes them out. They put him in jail and they take their businesses. Yeah, sure. And he's done this more than once, right. Did it to a guy recently and he only wound up taking one of his oil businesses.

Speaker 2:          00:07:56       Yeah. And you know, he's done it with, with famously with Gazprom and Rosneft, um, where, you know, one guy became the richest dude in the world and three other guys got either assassinated or went to jail. So I think that when you look at it, you know, uh, it's a tough place to do business. Russia, unless you're, unless you got a key card to the Kremlin, you're not going to get anything done.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       I mean, it's so blatant. It's so blatant. It's so strange.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       They just reactivated 28, 28 Cold War bases this year. So they were done. Okay. Cold War's over, you have luck. We're done. Boom. 28 basis reactivated like, ah, what,

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       what do you think that they feel like the only way to recharge the economy is being a full blown conflict with the United States.

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       And I think that it was a humiliation in Russia. Um, you know, we look at sort of Gorbachev and Yeltsin and go, oh, you know, they finally came to their senses and joined the world and whatever, you know, Yeltsin drank a bit too much or whatever. But uh, there, that's seen as a huge humiliation as we, you know, we were at, if not number one, we were number two for a long time. And then we went to being an also ran and that was a, it was a lot of resentment there. A B, then as oil came on the ascendancy, they're like, okay, we're going to throw our weight around. So they were subsidizing oil, for example, Cuba was subsidized. Well, you know, one of the reasons why they're like, oh, let's be friends again, is there's no more oil sipes subsidies and it's the same thing in, in, in the region. And then I think what happened is Putin came along and said, Russia is the best again and we're going to fuck with people and we're going to take back our land that they took from us and we're going to take back this and our military the best. And we're going to put more money in the military and we're going to reactivate these bases. And people went, yeah, good. Why not? By the way, you've got to remember, you've got to remember too, that

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       grew up where we were the boogie man. So it's not too like, you know, all the old people, like if you look at the Fox News, people that are like, yeah, fuck we run Roger those. They're all comedies. Well, all the people in Russia are going, I know the Americans eat the babies, you know, and, and so it's not that much of a stretch. Well, and if you look at like the way we behave abroad, I mean the fact that we have multiple wars going on, that we have a drone on their, on their border, we look scary as fuck to say outside of us. Remember that? Remember that sting song? Uh, the Russians love their children too. Yeah. He's a great song. Yeah. Yeah. I remember listening to that song and thinking, was it Stinger? The police might have been, I think it was staying. I think it was when his sounds like staying, but it was the era of the police.

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       Yeah. Um, and he was, I mean, we thought of them like that there was going to kill everybody. It was through this going to be a nuclear war. The Russians were going to kill anybody. It hovered over our head all the time. Well, you and I grew up at the end of the Cold War when it was still full on. Yeah. It's propaganda shit. You ever watched like war games and like that was just a given. Yeah, of course we're going to destroy each other. It's just a matter of time. And then when you get to school and you find out about the Cuban missile crisis and go, wait, but how close was that? Oh fuck man. Wait a minute. What we're going to go to nuclear war with? For what? Yeah. Holy Shit. The idea is that that almost happened or could sprays up and, or even like step one and a three step process of happening. Yeah. It's completely

Speaker 2:          00:11:22       Leah Insane. And we had this small interim of sanity where we all went,

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       those guys were crazy. It's a good thing. We're not like that anymore. And now we're going. Yeah, we still have all those warheads pointed at them. They still have all those warheads pointed it at us. And you're like, well, why? It really is amazing if you think about how long people have been alive for, it really is amazing that we've only dropped two nuclear bombs since 1947 yeah, I mean just those two. Yeah. And that was it. Well, there were bad, so they scared the shit out of that. But everything else we keep doing, everything else is fucked up. We keep doing it. But that was the one thing that we ever did that was so brutal and so real. There was no way of morally like rationalize. Well, even us at our craziest, and even the Russians at their craziest, you know, we never did it, but the problem is is we were rational actors.

Speaker 3:          00:12:16       We were like, even if we hated each other, and even if there was propaganda, we're still rational actors. The problem, the worry is you have irrational actors, like Pakistan has over a hundred war warheads and they're rapidly becoming an irrational act because they're losing control over their country to the Taliban who you know, who, who are are, whose agenda is clearly stated that they want to fuck us up. So I mean that's, that's where it gets terrified, but we shouldn't, it's the New Year Joe. We shouldn't start. We should get, we shouldn't get straight into like, you know, and w and the vector for war had number six one seven nine is Carmel, California. I had these conversations with you more than anybody I know because you're the one that you're the one who actually goes to these fucking places. You, you actually go, well I will say creepy, scary spots and coming back with news.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       But you know, I used to be afraid of, of why know I go with all these war zones and I still am. But you know, war is bad. Everyone always says, well, we go to war and they picture sort of manly GI Joe type shooting each other and it generally doesn't look like that. It's lots of collateral damage and women and children being fucking blown to shit and then guys go in there and get PTSD and get their ass shot off. But you know, the thing is, is one of the things that I recently came back from, it fucked me up. Like really? I mean, now I'm to the point where I'm having a kind of an existential crisis going, well, what's it all mean is I went to the South Pole because we did this, we did this piece on Greenland melting, which one is the Emmy last year?

Speaker 3:          00:13:53       We got a lot of uh, uh, whatever, uh, discussion around it on both sides of, of the, uh, of the debate. Although why it's a fucking debate, I don't know. But anyway, the Arctic is melting. One of the things that's happening, the reason why the Cold War is heating up again as the, under the Arctic ice, there's tons of oil and gas and Russia doesn't have any other money besides oil and gas. The Russia literally went put the flag in the Arctic Circle. We talked to the guy who did it and said, well we own all this. Now we're taking all the oil and gas. Of course, every country that borders them as a NATO country and if you attack one you attack them all. So this is why the Cold War, heating it up. People are afraid. Any who. So we go to the Arctic is melting. Greenland is melting. Everyone now is like, yeah, yeah, okay we'll give you, that will give you, Greenland is melting in the Arctic melting but Antarctica is actually gaining in ice.

Speaker 3:          00:14:40       So like it's kind of evening its self out, which is crazy to begin with. But we're like okay, instead of saying you're crazy, we're going to say okay fuck it, we'll go, we'll go down and we'll see what the fuck it is. So we go down with NASA, we go down with, you know, the top scientists in the world from, I mean from, from well from about 20 different countries. But the top guy is a French guy and we go to the, to the South Pole and we're like, so, so, so the, you know, Arctic is melting and Greenland is melting, but Antarctica is not like we have, we have ice gain and they're like, you're fucking stupid. Like what the fuck? And because what, what was happening was their sea ice, right? Which is like, like if it's like a lake freezes and then it melts, it freezes and it melts and the lake doesn't go up or down because it's ours.

Speaker 3:          00:15:33       It's the same water. It's like an ice cube that's already in the glass just melted. It doesn't land ice old die. The shit that's melting. It's like putting new ice in the glass. Right? So it overflowed that sea level rise. So they're like, yeah, there's CIS gain on this side and on this side, the sea, the sea ice is the shit that doesn't matter. I don't know this side land. Ice Is fucking melting as fast as it can go. Land Rights is a scary shit because land ice is the adding the new water in. So that sea level rise. That's glaciers. Glaciers. Exactly. So I go down there and I go with all these different scientists. I go on planes with lasers and radars to fucking measure everything and all these dudes and scientists and everyone like, oh fuck yeah, like, like board, like yeah, it's a given. He has a mounting, it's going to melt. We're done. We're going to fucking mouth. And we're like,

Speaker 4:          00:16:23       well,

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       why don't we know about that? And they're like, well we do, I mean, we published the reports, published the data NASA published today. That's fine. Bob Is the data. And you're like, um, I'm a guy who does this for a living and I don't know this shit. Like, why the fuck? So you know, we got the top scientists and we went to the thing, whatever. And they're like, yeah, oh fuck yeah, it's going to be at, you know, three meters, four meters. And, and at that point you're like, well, that remaps the world. Shouldn't we be making a bigger fucking deal about this? Because you know, and I always get shit for shit talking about it. I'm not, you know me, I'm not a tree hugger. I'm a fucking beer drinking football stuff and staking guy. But when I see shit like this, I go,

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:17:07       why the fuck aren't we freaking the fuck out? Because all the wars in the world don't matter if we add three or four meters of sea level rise. So don't get anything on the ocean in Malibu. Don't do that. That what you're saying is that the hidden message here? Well if you do sell it within five years, dude's that live in those stilt houses. Like how confident are you that the ocean is not going to take your place? Man Tilts into the sand. Oh, tanker didn't cement. That's going to stop the ocean. The ocean anyway. How much quicker? We don't have to get into this year's. We're backing into doom and gloom, but it's okay the it's going so got some water. Good IBCC report. Well the one thing is is we won't, it looks like a lot of people won't die because they'll move, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:55       We, we have legs and we can move. We can build new cities and shit. The problem is, is, you know, we, we, we, we go to Antarctica and all these, they're all scientists are all dudes and they're like either, you know, very clinical, I guess Robert lose three meters and meanness and listen to this. And then you go to Bangladesh, which is sort of at sea level and they're just, you know, I think last year alone there was like 20 million climate change migrants. So then you go to the city and it's just, I mean it's fucking, you know, it's just everything breaks down. Nothing works. Just, just, there's 20 million people in the city that's built for 2 million people. It's just, it's, it's just crazy. And you're like, when do you see it? You Go, oh, rich people or whatever, it will be able to move up the hill or Colorado or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       And everyone else is just like, well, you guys have to stay in the garbage heaps and see how you, how you can do it. And when, when, when you see it going forward. Like, I'm a, I'm a positive guy. I believe things you know, genuinely have gotten better throughout history and quality of life has gotten better and health has gotten better and all this shit. But you know, you're, you're basically saying, well, if there's going to be hundreds of millions of people forced to move because of this, then that's going to cause chaos. Chaos generally isn't good for anyone who is a young 20 year old dude with a club in his hand, you know? Yeah. And even him, it's really not. It's good for him for a bit. Tell somebody with a bigger club, fuck. Take a person who's better at hitting what is the longest pipeline we have as far as oil.

Speaker 3:          00:19:32       Like I know there's, that's one of the issues that keystone pipeline when you're trying to get oil all the way from Alaska, right? Yeah. I mean, my question being, why can't we do that with ice? With all the water's draining, just pumping into cal California needs water. Just bring a pipeline of water down here and just spray that stupid death valley area. That area is stupid. Let's turn death valley into a forest. You know, you can. Yes, you can do that. But that would be the shit. But then it's the ice, it still gets in and the SI tables still whatever. Just by fucking real estate in Greenland. Right. Cause it's kind of two people are doing lush tropical people are actually, well mining companies because you couldn't get to the, to the land before. Now that mining companies are buying it all up because of the ice has melted.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       When was it named? He was it, was it named Greenland ironically or was it yeah, that's a good point. It was named that because it was Iceland and Greenland and they switched the names because I believe it was Leif Ericson or Erik, the Red Leif Erickson or one of the reds. One of Erickson's. Anyway, he went there and he didn't want people cause he wanted it to be his own. So he named Iceland, Iceland and Greenland. Greenland to freak them out. Okay. So the went to Greenland looking for what the fuck. Everything is nice. Then he Iceland's the sweet spot. Iceland's the sweet spot. That is a good spot to his, if I can give some love the documentaries on Iceland, you guys did one on the Iceland. Strong men fucking dude's to just carry rocks around up there. They're ridiculous people. There's some crazy genetics going on.

Speaker 3:          00:21:07       I got to move there. I was just going to move. They're big. They're big motherfucker so big. They're like freakish, like cartoon for date. But what's weird about it is that there's a ton of them. It's not like one dude, one genetic anomaly could lift the fucking car above his head. It's like there's 17 of them that all the strongest dudes in the world are all from one fucking tiny little place. They all have those crazy fucking names too that are really difficult to pronounce. There's always a magnus in there from the late, you know, there's so, there's so much, but I guess they are. I mean it makes sense. They're like this descendants of vikings and certainly they just lift shit all day while they're just manly. It's fun. I mean, if you're the descendants of the, some of the greatest conquerors in the most part, parent conquers ever.

Speaker 3:          00:21:55       It's just that genetics doesn't just stop. It's also fucking, even if they're not in jail, like whoever lived or whoever was like the, the product of sex with one of those men, like if those women lived and their children lived, even if the Viking didn't live, that's like you're talking about some insane genetics problem. It's also not like la or, or you know, let's say Panama, we can pick the bananas off the trees. Like to live in Iceland, you gotta be tough as fuck. You got to go out on freezing cold water and like stab a cod. The spirit. Yeah. Like it's, it's hard. It's, it's cold and forbidding. You got to learn how to drive in the ice. Yeah. It's fun as hell though. I love Iceland. It's a great, but I love Greenland actually. I went there and was blown away by how beautiful it was.

Speaker 3:          00:22:37       Did you eat that shark dish that they have that's supposed to be disgusting, that fermented, fermented puffin? I believe that what it is. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did. No, I'm not into fuck. You know, I'm not like, my thing is to go to weird countries and, and shoot the newsy but not eat the shit because I get the shit to anyways. So if I'm eating fermented puffing, I'm like, I'm not getting on that plane gets a shark dish. It's maybe it's a, I know they have, maybe it's a pickle. I know they have fermented puffin and it's the most disgusting fucking thing in the world because it comes from, it comes from Matt, Jess or whatever it's called, which is the fermented herring, which they had to make illegal in Sweden because it stank so bad. So they made it like you can't make it in your house or shit anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:23:21       You can't make it. No, it's illegal, but it's a Swedish national did. They can't cause it stinks so bad. And then, and then instead of the fermented herring, they did the fermented Puffin, which I dunno, well they might do that as well, but they do do a shark thing. It's called a hot Cari. Okay. How Carl? I guess it's how Carl, all right. Whatever. I don't know how they talk. It's, it's a very interesting pronunciation. Um, but it's a Greenland shark. Uh, or other sleeper shark that's been cured with a particular fermentation process and hung to dry for four to five months. It turns black. Yeah, I've seen it hanging. Oh my God. Look up fermented puffin now you give me my five minutes for minted puffin. Fermented puffing and puffing. Puffing is the cute, it's like a cute looking bird, I think Icelandic. Yeah, they apparently they ferment a lot of shit.

Speaker 3:          00:24:20       Yeah. They ferment a puffin. They ferment often, which is a bird. Yeah, a cute little bird. And they ferment the fucker and it reeks so bad. And then, you know, it's one of these things where you have to eat it or whatever. And I used to go out to eat it. I don't care. And then you're just, yeah, I'm not, I'm not going to eat the fermented puffin. I think if you live in a place like scary as far as climate and as harsh as Iceland, you learn how to eat fucking everything. Puffins they just, you know how they do what they call it? Sky Fishing. Apparently it says there are hunted by sky fishing, which involves catching low flying birds with a big net. So they just like calves, nets in the sky. They look all these bourbons that they scoop up birds from the sky as they're flying, ferment them until they're rotten and then eat them.

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       Oh, this is so disgusting. They bottle it and there's all sorts of different ways they'd cook it. Uh, but uh, it's uh, well smoked and cured sometimes, but the fermented one is this disgusting. I'm not doing the fermented toughen. The Greenland, the one that basking shark is what I saw Bordain eat. And uh, it looked pretty foul. Yeah. Oh No. We don't want to do that. But it's, that's must be, develop a taste for it because you need that protein. There's not a lot of options. I guess. So. I mean, I smelled the, the fermented herring. The Swedes do. And you're like, it's like hardcore hardcore ammonia and you're like, how, like it's telling you not to eat it. Like, why would the fuck would you, I don't know why. Yeah. I mean, what, what happens to a person's body does that, like they get get they're accustomed to it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:04       It was like a, I have no idea. I mean that doesn't make any sense. I have no idea. I mean less you're starving and Iceland gets a plane. Oh, you have a weird thing like kids, you know, you develop your taste when you're kid and like, you know what Natto is, you know? No, it's like fermented beans. Very strong taste. Everyone in Japan eats it for breakfast, not too, oh, delicious. Not the end. It's like, it's like from like rotten, rotten sticky beans and it's, but you know, again, you go there and they love it and they eat it with a sort of strong mustard. But um, you got a lot of places. I remember, you know, I was sick somewhere anyway. He was somewhere, uh, maybe it was Katmandu. Anyways, I was sick and they brought me the spiciest like craziest fucking Chili, like, you know, Vindaloo and, and I was like, I'm sick.

Speaker 3:          00:26:55       I want like a grilled cheese sandwich and ginger rail. Like, you know, I want to, and they brought me the spiciest crazy chili shit and it, it's just, look, everybody has a different, I don't know, different, you know, comfort food or whatever when they're sick or whatever they believe they're going to eat or something. Well, they say that fermentation is how people figured out how to make alcohol. Yeah. We'll figure it out. They got drunk from fermented things. Do you get, is there a certain amount of intoxication you get from those? From Amy maybe? I Dunno, that's a good question. I know alcohol, it was a way to transport water. Wine was a way to transport water. They're like, oh, because a lot of places they would go to, it was a big thing. Anthrax was huge because the, the animals would go to know and they fall in the water and then the whole pond or the whole water source becomes an [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       That's where anthrax comes from. Yeah. Yeah. So it just comes from like a decaying animal. Yeah. And so and so it was a lot of water was unsafe. So like, oh we need to figure out a way to carry water with us. And they figured out a lot of ways, but wine was one of them. One or we can carry this for you know, years we can get of this. And they didn't have corks that just put a bit of olive oil on top of it, which would seal it. And I was like, that means that if you go logically, they were drinking a shit pile of wine because they were like, well I'm not going to trust the water cause I don't know that the animals haven't died in it, so I'll just drink wine all day every day. I lived off wine. That is hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       What explains like a lot of the crazy shit that people can get it back then just drunk in bands of marauders going up from hillside the hillside. Yeah. That's really crazy. If you stop and think about it, like the people that were traveling and drinking wine and exclusively for hydration, what the difference it must've been on the way they thought and behaved. Explains a lot of history. It does. We're really fair. We're figuring it all out here. Yes. We figured out two things. I figure it out. We just got to get a pipeline. I'm black man from Antarctica or Greenland, pour that water in the palm springs and palm desert, all that area. Just fucking make it a lush, lush tropical forests. We could do that. All right. Just how about a big pipe and like a sprinkler system over la? It just rains while La la needs water magic.

Speaker 3:          00:29:09       That's what it came down to. We have artificial eggland high rail, uh, like shower systems over cities. There's a rain anymore in la. So La decided it needed a shower system. We'd cause a lot of, a lot of news saying we're going to reuse the keystone pipeline, not for oil, but for glaciers so that we can actually have water. That would be bad ass. Nobody would oppose that pose. Moving water. Well, if oil keeps going down and water keeps going up, it will be economically feasible. You make more money selling water, then you will be a commodity. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, that's the projection, right? We're, we're going to actually have an issue with fresh water but then the next 50 to 60 years or we have an issue with it now. What will you see those lakes, Texas, if you've been to Austin, Have Lake Travis and Lake Austin and Lake Travis.

Speaker 3:          00:29:57       They don't artificially feet like Austin looks bad ass but lake Travis has vanished all the uh, yeah, we did a piece on it. All the, the houseboats and everything are sitting just on like not even dry land. Like cake, like scorched land. Yeah. And the docs are nowhere near the water anymore. I don't know. Hundreds of yards. It's a weird, it's like you will Texas but has been in drought now for three years. Three years as this California. Yeah. I think there there's this worse is worse. Also they have a lot of agriculture there too, right? They have a lot of agriculture farm. The big thing is now the, the, I believe the numbers are staggering. Like one third of of beef cattle are gone. Like, you know, like just trip, which in Texas is a huge numbers, millions and millions and we have a lot of agriculture in California, but we have nearly as much as Texas has.

Speaker 3:          00:30:49       I think, uh, like Louise more water. Well I think there's more straight up ag agriculture in California, but there's more uh, like to, and Shit, you know, there's this many tigers in Texas is there are in the wild. That's tragic and weird. It's amazing. But there's, yeah, I mean there's not that many left in the wild and there's a lot of crazy people in Texas. They want to buy one. So it doesn't surprise me. Texas has a huge population of these wildlife parks. They had a wild game parks where you could go like shoot a zebra. Yeah. With a compound bow go hunters, zebra. Like they have these crazy fucking parks where they have wild animals. It's not just a few. There's a lot of people have private collections. I've heard of that. And my favorite story is not actually in Texas, but uh, in, in Columbia where a Escobar loved wild animals.

Speaker 3:          00:31:40       So he bought like hippos and elephants and tigers. And then when it all went to shit, they just went into the jungle and they're just procreating and living and you're like, it's kind of, that's kind of cool actually, you know? Yeah. Probably environmentally. They're not supposed to have elephants and in, in Columbia. But uh, having the, the, the animals sort of set free into the wild is I think, I think it was good. Yeah. Well there's, um, there's a lot of people in this country that have private collections. They have one animals. There was the guy that lived in Ohio. He opened his gates, let all of his animals out, and then blew his brains out. No cops, cops showed up. And you know, there's all these wild animals, including is dangerous ones like lions and shit. So these cops have to shoot these animals. They can't even save him because he can't let them go out into the wild, not wild cities, suburban neighborhood. It's close. So then I just

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       wind up shooting all of them. But it's, this guy was fucking crazy. But you can just do that. You can have tigers in your yard. Like Mike Tyson had a tiger. Like you can have a tiger. Like that is insane. Like there needs to be a law on that. Like that, that's more ridiculous than guns.

Speaker 2:          00:32:56       No more tigers left in the world. But you know, Joe blow down in Dallas comes inside like a tiger, send me,

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       listen son. I got the healthiest tag or community and all of North America, he's here. Tigers. These are direct from India. I don't fuck with them. Siberian tigers. There's slower. Okay. They're lazy. They don't kill. Yeah. There's a, there's a ton of wild game parks in Texas where they, they took a lot of animals that were almost extinct in Asia and now they're thriving. And today's, yeah. Species of deer. Like there's many species of deer that they have that they take from other countries. Uh, and they bring to America and they put them in his game parks, especially in Texas. And then they can hunt them anytime they want. Right, right. Because they become like a commodity instead of it being like, there's seasons for deer and the season for it. There's seasons for everything else, but these animals that are non [inaudible] non native, yeah. Get on them anytime you want. So they bring them over there just specifically for that purpose, but so they're thriving because they're worth something. Right, right, right. She's really kind of trippy know. It's like, yeah, you want the animals to be thriving. But it's kind of weird that the only way they're thriving is if dudes to get out there and shoot. But

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       this is, you know, not a, uh, a tremendously popular, uh, um, sort of argument, but it actually makes a lot of sense. Like when we did this piece on, um, a rhino poaching, you know, they, they killed the rhino just for the horn because they sell it in Vietnam as an aphrodisiac. And the guy who is trying to save the rhinos is saying, you know, legalize it and we'll take the horns off. Cause you can take the whole, it's like, it's made it like, it's like to hair. Yeah. You can take the horn off and we'll just sell it and then therefore they don't have to kill the rhinos for the horn. It'll just be a market and everyone's freaking out saying, no, no, no, but, but as long as dudes who are poor can make a ton of money for killing thing to take the horn, they will.

Speaker 2:          00:35:01       Whereas if you just say, okay, well, you know, we'll give you the fucking horn and you can do whatever they want you to have as many voters as you want, go nuts. That's the only way to save them is capitalism is killing them. So capitalism has to save them. And initially you go, well that doesn't sound right, but when you think about it, you're like, well, okay. Yeah. Then the problem is, well somebody will be like, someone will regulate it and like a company, GM will make the money out of the illegal rhino horns, but they'll still be illegal rhino horns because the, the guys will get disenfranchising. They'll get screwed out

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       of it somehow. But in any way, the argument that you have to make it as economically viable to do the thing because otherwise they'll just kill to get killed out. [inaudible] massive rhino horns really did give you a hard on rhinos would have been extinct a long fucking time ago for it to really work. Well, the other thing is, is like you're like rhino horns give you a hard on and whatever. You're like, just fucking buy Viagra. Cialis 99 cents is a lot cheaper because it's expensive. It's like 20 grand for a piece of rhino and you're like, you get fucking a vat of Viagra for that. You could bathe in Viagra. The rest of it all day, every day. Like, what the fuck? It's 20 grand. So expensive. It's crazy. But it doesn't do anything. It's just like eating someone's hair. Yeah. I mean, similar. I'm going to grind a fingernail and I'm going to grind up the hair and fingernails and uh, and that's gonna get me hard.

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       But, but, but seriously, like just take fucking, they bootleg Viagra for like a penny, you know what I mean? Anyway. Well, they also put it in those a boner pills that you buy at gas stations. Like they, those boner pills that you put Viagra, they put the Rhino Horn. No, they put via those, those boner pills itself for like three 95 for like a little packet. You know, I don't want to go try him. I don't know. I don't know those ones. Ben Takes Him all the time. That's a fucking freak. He's always buying them. And I'm like, why won't you just buy real Viagara we know what the fuck you're taking. Taking this crazy shit from this gas station. You know what's called red hot super deck, you know, but a gel. I got two back, just red hot super deck. What's it? Um, I don't know, but the shit works.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       That's no worst. That's no better than eating Rhino Horn. That's just, well, it's no better than eating garbage you find on the street. But we did another piece on that that I found fascinating because I didn't know anything about it, was that, you know, you have a, you know, like first of all bath salts, you know, people were like fucking and then eating each other and like I fucking, while they eat them and I'm like, what, what are they doing? How do they have bath? Like bath salts? And they're like, what's not, they're not fucking bath salts. He called them bath salts, but you can buy them in the corner store and now they have like their legal, you know, they have fake cannabinoids or they have fake, uh, uh, whatever other kinds of chemicals or get you high, whatever. And what happened was in New Zealand, um, math was such a huge problem that they, that they went to the government and said, let's make like a healthier version of math or you know, seed. But like with, just with chem, like real chemicals and stuff. And so they did, they illegally made, you know, drugs, pills and the math problem went down. And you know, they were healthier version of drugs or whatever, but they were like selling them next to like chocolate bars and shit. So the, the, the, you know, the moms and everybody went, well, this is not

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       cool that you can buy math next to the chocolate bars. Quite rightly. And, and they, so they banned them again. But what happened was online you can go and just change the molecule and before the DEA, you know, get catch up. You just change it again. And in China they have these companies where you can just email them saying d to the power of seven. And they're like, right, I'll send you 10 kilos tomorrow. So it comes in, they just mix it up, put it in a package of Scooby doo and the cover and say, there you go. And you can sell them legally until you have to change the molecule again. And there's like the, the, you know, you, you, you smoke these things, his snoring, me do whatever and they're fucking so strong, like crazy strong. And, and here's me mister hipster going, I didn't even know that fucking existed. You can walk into any corner store and buy these off the rack and just go outside into the back and, and go to Neptune.

Speaker 3:          00:39:35       And have they,

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       they've made it illegal in a few different states. But the problem is they have to specify what exactly

Speaker 3:          00:39:43       go it and they just alter a thing. And then there's a new wave and then they alter a thing and then there's, and bath salts was, uh, somebody put the wrong molecule in there. And we decided that we were getting eat, somebody knows off as we were having sex and that was one of the side effects might experience sexual addiction and cannibalism simultaneously.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       My favorite drug reaction ever was there. There's a drug called reequip and re equipped. They were given to people that suffer from Parkinson's degree. Oh Shit. Parkinson's syndrome. And uh, they gave it to this guy, I think it was in Dublin and it turned him into a gay sex and junkie and a gambling junkie. The guy all of a sudden became gay from this Parkinson's disease, started having risky gay sex with a man, like leaving ads to meet, meet up places, meeting guys and having sex with him. Had no idea we were in gambling, couldn't stop gambling. Like it was just completely addicted to gambling all day long. You just wanted to gamble and won in court. The, the American equivalent of somewhere around $600,000

Speaker 3:          00:40:48       really proved that it was just him going, fuck it. I gotta get out of jail free card. I'm going for the full blue bull goose loony. I'm buckets it seems like. Right? Yeah. I've always wanted just fucking random. I'm taking a weird pill. Get out of jail free. Here we go. Let my freak flag fly. Yeah. I wonder like how much do you have to prove? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       when a case like that because it was against Glaxo Smith Kline.

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       Yeah, you got it. A big pharmacy, you've got to think he had a pretty, a pretty good case cause they would shut him down. It has to be locked down tight. He could never, you can never have ever played cards or looked at a dick before and then all of a sudden it was just like boom. He was living in a different country though. They might have different standards as far as like

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       what they think, you know, pharmaceutical drug companies responsible for, well it's Ireland, so there's really, yeah, I'm pretty sure it was Ireland for a few Bob. Yeah. What a crazy story though. You never imagined being a normal guy. All of a sudden you just can't stop fucking playing cards at gay orgies. Just like, it's just all day. Your life is consumed with Dick dice and just woo, come on. Give me that. Just a constant chaos of, of, you know, you should be in sales. Um, you know, that just sounds like a good time. Uh, reequip case x trial. We'll find out where the fuck this was. Yeah. Yeah. The guy was a gifted, it's on ABC News, man. Wow. Yeah. Uh, Parkington medication made him a gibbet addicted to gambling and gay sex.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Jesus. Oh my God. It's hilarious. He was from France. So the whole stories now suspect. I'm so sorry. I brought this up to you folks. For sure. That guy was just making it up. Yeah. Fucked up. What's happening in France right now. Yeah. That's a second. Somehow fucked up. Yeah. Well, we went from funny to, yeah, we talked when we went dark. You know what's really not funny? I've actually seen people that are taking this very interesting stance on this story. Um, the whole story, if you don't know what it is, how do you say the name of the paper? Charlie. Charlie Hebdo Abdo. Um, they made the satire cartoons about Mohammed and about Islam and, uh, they were murdered. 10 people, two police officers, 12 people were murdered by these, uh, Islamic hit people. And there's been all these protests and France and all these marches and everybody's freaking out worldwide.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       But I've seen some people take the stance that those cartoons were offensive and they, they were punching down at that. That was sad to her. They were punching down and that those, those cartoons were racist. And that, you know, don't they understand that it's offensive. I read this, a tweet actually don't they understand that it's offensive not just to Muslims but to one quarter of the people on the planet. That was what they wrote as if that in any way, like when do we put our foot down and say, look, you're, I know you're a tolerant person. Whoever's saying this is that you're trying to preach tolerance. You're talking about tolerance for something that kills people, that draw tunes, like look,

Speaker 2:          00:44:08       Charlie Hebdo and, and cartoons and humor in general is meant to be a mirror onto ourselves. And you know, we take ourselves so seriously. And when you start, I believe if you start any type of censorship, you're fucked. Because when you know somebody won't like something and then the other person won't like the thing that you like. And once you start down that path and you say, well, you know Joe, you know, uh, I hate that you know that you like, you know, Palestine. Well Shane, I hate to, you're like Israel. Whatever it is, someone's always, always going to have. And the minute someone gets that, then censorship starts in the minute censorship starts. It never stops. First of all, censorship by fear. And we were just, you know, we started the whole conversation about this censorship by fear was Nazi Germany, censorship by fear with Stalinists Russia.

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       Censorship by fear was mad. I was China. And if you wrote or thought or said anything against the state, you got killed. And now what we're saying is if you do or say or do anything against a perceived, you know, thing about a religion, then they're going to come get you. Right? And people were like, terrified, oh my God, we're not going to show the cartoons. We're not going to show, we're not going to, what do you think you can like that? There's that many terrorists out there, they're going to kill everybody who retweets a fucking cartoon. And that's the insidiousness of, of, of, of, of terrorism. Because then you're like, if you make fun of anything, if you make fun of any political leader or political group or terrorist group or anyone with a gun, they get can, can of, can come out and shoot you.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       And I think that's the whole thing of like, uh, no, they're allowed to fucking say, guess what? You're allowed to say whatever the fuck you want. And then I'm allowed to say whatever the fuck I want against you. But the minute you say you're not allowed to say what you want and if you do, I'll shoot you, then you can fuck off. And that's what World War II was fought over. That's what world war one was fought over. And if we don't say there can be no censorship than we should have just given up and said, yeah, fuck, we'll just write whatever Hitler wants us to write because that's what censorship is.

Speaker 3:          00:46:08       I was just shocked at how many people who call themselves progressives were taking the stance that the, the jokes actually were inflammatory, but they had the same fucking jokes about everybody. They there were an equal opportunity asshole. They fucking went after everybody and that was their job. That's their thing. They would, that it's satire. It's making fun of Shit. We roast for the world, a roast for the world, but they roasted everybody. And so the fact is you're now, you're allowed to rose to everyone except for these guys because these guys have, we'll shoot you. Well, not, it's not just dad, it's the, what's freaking me out is not that just that people are willing to shoot you over cartoon. That's been freaking me out for a long time. But that somehow or another people that call themselves progressive will stand up and say, well, you know, I looked at what these people were doing. What they were doing was really offensive. Like that's fucking crazy. But you know the reason why that's happening, why is it because

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       what's happening now is we're reaching a critical mass, right? You're reaching a point where, which by the way, if you look at terrorism, it's been incredibly successful because you're reading a quote, you're reaching a critical mass where worst people are saying now it will be like this. You know, for example, the, the fight, the, the, the reaction always. Well, Islam

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       as a religion of peace. Now that's become a joke because everyone's like, well, it's a fucking religion of peace. Why does this continue happening? Right? And so progressive's or whatever are trying to say, hey, well maybe because they realize that the logical conclusion of this right is going to be, there's going to be bad. It's going to be okay. There is going to be an effective as this polarized is Islamic fundamentalism gets bigger. And then our reaction to that fundamental fundamentalism gets worse because, look, I'm, I believe I'm oppressive, progressive guy. I don't know what that means, but I'm nonpolitical on either side and I believe I look at things critically. But at a certain point you're like, well this is getting bad now and public opinion is getting heated and the end result of that is going to be, you're going to have heated public opinion on one side, a bunch of guys with a bunch of guns on the other and it's not going to end well.

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       So people, it's a type of appeasement, right? It's a type of, well I looked at it, it's not so bad. Well it is bad, but that is high in terms of excitement by progressive's, um, by really liberal people, which uh, the same type of people that will shit on Christians but use the term Islamophobic for any criticism of an Nad. Jokes. In fact, any jokes in fact about Islam or Muslims can be seen as Islamophobic, but the same type of people that would have no problem shitting your Christian Jews. And it's just weird thing. It's because of this, this is what become, what's the park? It's appeasement. And, and quite frankly, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Everybody should be game. And, and that's what freedom is all about. Who's it appeasement to? It's this weird social brownie point thing that they're doing where they're, they're maybe looking at it as an opportunity to criticize racism or criticize, punching down with humor.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       You know, maybe I, I mean, I, sorry, I'm getting a drink. So, no worries man. I think, you know, for me, I think it's, it's, we're afraid of the outcome because if we keep going on this trajectory, the outcome is going to be problematic. I think you have a point there for sure. But I also think one of the things that's going on is there's a bunch of people in this culture that have this bizarrely Utopian version of what they would like us to be like the way we should react to anything. People that think that they're a Fox something, someone that, uh, decides to, uh, have whatever, any strange idea they may have in their head. We're supposed to be as even keeled with them as possible. Well, I don't want to get started on politics. I think politics in this country is fucked.

Speaker 3:          00:50:19       I think it's Moreso, I think it's fucked and it's getting worse. And we could go on till the cows come home about politics in this country. Um, one thing I would like if we were, if you want, I would be long winded and boring for most people, but, um, I read a book, if anyone wants to read maybe the most fascinating book ever written about the, uh, the, uh, the situation that we're dealing with right now and with the rest of the world. And Islam is a, is called the siege of Maca. And it's a true story. It's a journalist who wrote it about in 1979, which was the, the, the difference, uh, I believe the year 1400 in the Islamic calendar, there was a siege of Maca and, uh, a bunch of dudes who were wahabiists took over Maca during Hajj and the Royal Government, uh, the royal family couldn't go get them because it's illegal to fight in Mecca.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       And so there was a standoff and there were fighting people shooting each other and snipers. It's like an action movie. The French secret service gave them drugs to drug them. And, and uh, at the time it was the same time that that was happening. Uh, the, the, the hostage crisis in Toronto, the ayatollah was a smart dude goes, yeah, the Americans, the CIA have taken over Mecca, which of course is like the worst thing you could possibly fucking do. So there's this whole upper, early, they burnt the embassy in Pakistan. They do all these things because everyone's like, fuck the CIA have taken over Maca, you know, and what ended up happening as long story but incredible action movie story. But what happened was the royal family had to go to the clerics and say, you've got to give us a fat whether we can go into Mecca and fight, because you're literally not allowed to bring a gun in a sword.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       Nothing. And so you have to give us a special fatwa to go get these terrorists. And they're like, well, we kind of believe in what they're saying because the, the, the terrorist, we're actually, you're just a hobbyist saying we need to be more wahabiists, which is fundamental Islam. So they said, we'll give you the fatwah if you then basically give us money to do what they're asking for it to, to be well hobbyist. So then anyways, it happens, they go to kill the guys guy named Jude Haman. But then what happens is from then on, billions and billions of petro dollars, which we pay the Saudi government then goes to the Ulama, the clerics who then send that money to every country, America, UK, France, you know, Pakistan. And they build the biggest mosques. And because Maca is like the Vatican would be in the UL mark or like the pope, they built the biggest mosques and they, you know, spend the most money and then they say, okay, now you teach Wahhabi Islam.

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       And you know, when you look at what's happening with Isis, you say, how the fuck can these guys recruit 50,000 foreign fighters in, in four fucking months? It doesn't make any sense. They're coming from America, they're coming from France or coming from England because these guys go to these mosques where there were hobbyists teachings, right? And then when you look at it, and when you look at what's happening with things happening in France with things happening in the UK with things happening in Pakistan, w w where we're saying we're not going to go with the Taliban, even in Pakistan now where we're going with isis or the Taliban is aligning with Isis and you say, how the fuck can that happen overnight? How can it happen that all these people are saying, fuck yeah, that's great. Isis. It's because we have the pope and the Vatican saying that that's good.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       That will hobby ism as good. So as long as that continues, the problem on the, that side is going to get worse. Right? And then as long as that problem gets worse, we're going to fucking react stronger and stronger as is only human. And that's the problem is, is we're heading for some sort of boiling over, we're heading for some sort of, you know, thing. And I think, and this is me giving people the benefit of the doubt, is that some people are saying, well fuck if, if, if we just let into everything now and say, you know, everyone's shooting us. If we say the wrong thing, fuck you, let's go. Then it's going to happen sooner rather than later. Which, which, which might be inevitable if Maca keeps on funding. Wahabiists Sunni doctrine. Jesus fucking in Christ Shane. Goddamn doom and gloom. Sorry Bitch. The world is melting coming from Russia.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       It's coming from, maybe North Korea is going to kidnap your wife and forced her to do porn. No, God dammit. This is all this shit. Sorry. Right now let's start 15 with some positivity. God Damn you freaking me the fuck that. Start with the positive. What about the, wow, the thing is we can change it all. We're human beings. We're smart and I believe there's enough of us now that are woken up and are smart and understand our political and economic power and we could stop all this shit from happening. Cause I'll tell you what, North Korea only exists because people let it exist. Right. Global warming only continues because we let it continue. I mean fucking other problems that we have with terrorism only continue because we let it fucking continue. If humanity as a whole says we ain't going to fucking do that anymore, it would stop tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       We would need a lot of people to band together to go after North Korea though. North Korea seems like a huge problem. And on top of that, don't think I have like nuclear weapons. I mean how are you going to stop? Well stop it from inside. You have to stop it from inside. But I think that that's where like everyone running around freaking out about the interview. Oh my God, North Korea fucking told us we can't do something. We should be figuring out ways of getting the interview into North Korea. We should in fact fuck the interview. We should be figuring out how to get at an NFL football into North Korea or, or like fucking, you know, lassie or Heidi, your dukes of hazard or any kind of shit. Because I think, you know, one of the smartest things that America learned after World War One and World War Two is if you, your troops had costs a lot of fucking money, and it takes a lot of lives where if you figure out that Marlboro's cokes and Mcdonald's and Hollywood, uh, everybody loves them, then guess what?

Speaker 3:          00:56:34       You don't have to fight the war. You want. Everybody's like, fucking, I want to smoke. This is Barbara while I'm drinking a coke and watch and Brad Pitt, you know, Graham ski and hedge money. And I think that we should be exporting our culture a lot more aggressively in the North Korea. And I'll tell you what, Kim Jong Un grew up in Switzerland. He loves basketball. He was watching TV. He knows what fucking time and he's in the, he's watched the, you know, fucking Dukes of Hazzard. He or I guess you'd be later. He'd be, what? What's the big 90 show? Check it out. I'm using the Detroit Pistons, right? Isn't he a big fan of, uh, what's his face? Rodman. Well, he was, yeah, he was bulls. They liked the bulls cause it was Jordan. Right. But what else did he play for it? Did he pay for the play Pistons and then they pistol's distance and bowls?

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       Yeah, you're right. He's got like metal all over his face now. Yeah. What's going on with that dude? He's a weird dude. He's always been a weird guy that Kim Jong Uhmm is sort of connected to. We sent them there. You know that? Yeah. But how the fuck is that real? Because they love fucking the bowls. I mean, if Michael Jordan would have gone there and I hope Michael Jordan, he listened to this. If Michael Jordan would have gone there, it would have been world peace. I mean forced him to do ebony porn. You know, I think, I think there would have been so much good will. He was said, look, let's just fucking call it a day. Do you think so if Michael Jordan, he would have been and he would, I think he would have been a god like ambassador and he would have been a little bit more sane.

Speaker 3:          00:57:59       Really? So you think you could have actually gotten like diplomacy accomplished? Well, I think there was the diplomacy accomplished. I think if you look at it, you know, one of the things that, um, well besides oil tanking, uh, that that helped detente between Cuba and, and America was baseball. If you look at [inaudible] and all the stars that came out of, of Cuba, you know, the culturally, they were just like, okay, fuck it. Fuck this. Let's just do it. And I think that, you know, the number one sport in North Korea is basketball. And so it's like if Jordan had gone there, or even if the bowls would've gone there and there had been a real fucking thing and a cultural outreach or whatever, it would have at least sped it up, right? Because that was ping pong diplomacy. They were like, wow, we don't actually eat each other's babies.

Speaker 3:          00:58:44       We play fucking Ping Pong. Like he like, like staying like w you know, everybody's kind of, you know, when I went, I was always, I grew up at the end of the Cold War and I was fascinated by propaganda. I was fascinated by eastern Europe and when I, as soon as it opened up and went to Prague and progress was inundated with Americans. So then I went to Budapest and then I went to Kia. But it was like not that much fucking different. They had, they had a car and they an apartment, they got two weeks and they went to lake bow tie. It was a shitty car and it was a sheet, but no fucking guy from point a to point B. And they kind of were pissed off at their government, but they were kind of like, wow,

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       whatever, fuck there's food in the second story, you know? And it was kind of shitty year. It was a shitty or gray or w you know, scary or I guess cause of the police version. But in reality it's like people are fucking people at the end of the day, except for North Korea. I mean North Korea, it's just fucking crazy. But I think that the more, it's not actually us, we're not doing shit over there. At least they think where the devil. But Chinese people who used to come look, they were wearing the man with suit and with the stars everywhere and they look the same and they talked to Sam and there was still revolutionary are now coming in Hawaiian shirts and with a cannon fucking ass five and a fucking thing. It's our culture got over there. Yeah. I think global culture got there and consumers culture, I mean China is the most capitalist country in the world now, but the Chinese who are coming in North Korea don't look like them any more.

Speaker 2:          01:00:09       They don't act like that. I mean they have fucking laser beams in their hands like phones, they don't have phones, they don't have computers. So they see all this shit from the Chinese and go, oh okay, something's going on. And I think if we, if we just exported our culture that the fact that hey guys, you're actually living in fucking a hundred years ago, you should come and get up to speed with us. I mean that's what happened in East Germany, east Germany, Western. And they said this is never going to come together. Boom. They realize that these motherfuckers over there and driving nine eleven's and I'm driving a fucking louder. So you know, that's what one, that's one won the war. This is there a way though. Did anybody could ever, I mean, you'd have to get rid of that whole family. You'd have to get rid of that whole, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          01:00:50       I mean government that's running. I mean, it's just soften. The family does, I mean, now who the fuck knows? I don't know shit. But you know, from what I know about going there a lot, the military runs everything. It's called military first. The army runs everything. Whenever the army runs everything anywhere, guess what? It's not a ton of fun. Kim Jong Moon is, is uh, is, is he looks like his, his, his Granddad, you know, he's a dad. He, they got him out of power. They killed number two. They fucked with his wife. They did all this shit, always got gout. They go away. They were just saying saying, hey, you know who's running shit? The army's running shit because if the army isn't running shit in North Korea, it's over. Because the minute the army isn't running shit, they're going to all be in line saying, can I please work at high die for some money cause I'm fucking hungry. Yeah, that's so true. It'll be exactly what happened in East Germany. I got a great idea for a buddy comedy.

Speaker 1:          01:01:43       How about this? How about Kim John Own captures a basketball, a college basketball team from like whatever, like the World Championship College Basketball is whatever the Flint talky get's Kentucky. Yeah, whatever the big, the big team is, captures them. Reroutes their plane. It lands in North Korea and kidnaps him and forces them to play basketball for him and they wind up taking on the North Korean army kicking everybody's ass and taking over the country and they become the president of North Korea.

Speaker 2:          01:02:14       I like it except for, except for, I'd like to change it to the best college basketball

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       team in America gets kidnapped by the North Korean, uh, desk spot, which makes them play the worst pro team in America for a winner take all game because it's always that question at the end of the year, if the best college team plays the worst pro team who would win. And I love those arguments and everyone's always like, well, if Oakland played Bama Wall, now it's a buckeyes. But if let's say Bama, cause I love Bam, if, if Oakland played Bammo, then you know, they would throw so many schemes up against them and they couldn't have, but you're like, Bam, I had the biggest offensive line in football, not only not just fucking, uh, college football, football. And they played together as a team and they're fucking Austin now. They sucked, you know, against Ohio. But in any case, the best college team, because then you could bet on it, you could bet on it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       And whoever won between American North Korea would run the world. I think we should do that. That's what we should set up. What if they want North Korea? We're on block, then we'll have to kick their ass again. We wanted the world for a second. We're fucked. We're not going to let you won the world forever for a basketball game. What do you retarded then we've failed in our mission, but the pros should, should win the Dream Team. Dream Team sharing happens in sports. You remember the Dream Team? People get tweaked and Spain. Yes. Michael Jordan wasn't there like a hockey game to where? Well that was the opposite Americans. That was the opposite. That was the Russians were effectively pros because they were the restaurant and they would go and then we were still putting up college players and even though the Russians were pros and we're going to kill us, we won.

Speaker 3:          01:04:00       So we became the underdog. We were, we were. We champion. Yeah. We also take day for the hockey people. It is a huge day to beat those ruskies have to beat the rush. The Cold War was played. We Ha we need to cut kind of cold war again just to have sports. Well, you know what? Fighting Sports, fighting. We've learned a lot from Russians. I'll tell you that. We've learned a lot how God damn tough. They are tough motherfucker. When we compare the softness of the average American male, so that shit I see on TV, the Russians do the crazy, the military guys over in Russia or are mean as fuck. Oh yeah, for sure. It's not just a military guys, but I mean just the average humans in Russia. But we'll just send drones, we'll send laser computer people over there while we won't win, we won't win if we fight the, well you've seen the shit.

Speaker 3:          01:04:47       They fucking have to, you know, squatting or haunches for three days and what can kicked in the face. I mean they're in a different level of shit now. Not to take anything away from the best military in the world, which is the American military. But the Russians are fucking tough motherfucker. You hit him in the face with a baseball bat and they smile. So it seems like, like whenever you hear about a crazy concept like an MMA concept comes out of Russia, like that team fighting where they had like five on five or six on six or some shit and then

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       there was another one that I saw there. There was two on two and once I, one I saw was these guys met in like a park somewhere and these rival teams and they beat the shit out of each other and a park. They just both met for a gang.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       Basically. They just want to fight the fuck out of it all the time. If you see the Russian, especially like the the, the, the special service training shit that they have to go through, it's fucking ridiculous. Obviously it's hard to become a seal or a ranger or whatever, but like, like I don't know, something like 50% of them die like some crazy stat. They're fucking crazy. Anyway, we don't want to fight them. I guess why everyone who's fought them from the Boli and they hit their devry last set, the mangoes, mangoes, tomorrow's memorial was beating everybody. Mongols took over, rushed for 200 years. The only reason why they didn't get the Europe is cause they got it

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       tired if they were all drunk, drunk or horses aren't big enough. My question was, I wonder if like, because the, because Russia has suffered the defeat and the Cold War and economic disparity and it was called hard times. They've gone through some brutal infighting and all the shit that happened, the people that did survive there, there, there are different, there's like a different lineage where they're tough as hell. Yeah. Yeah. And I wonder if that's just what happens and then those people rise up and then the people like us that are on top of things, we start criticizing cartoons and they get soft and fat. And when they made the cartoon shouldn't be punching down. Yeah. Let me get, we get goofy. That's true. Yeah. And then we get so unrealistic as to the nature of man and the ways of the world and the way things work right now. Not a utopian vision of what could certainly be possible. But the fact like I saw a t shirt, uh, you don't like cops next time you get in trouble, call crackhead. Well listen, people that are complaining and bitching about cops, I guarantee you if someone was breaking into your fucking house, you're going to call nine one one right?

Speaker 2:          01:07:16       Whenever you're right. But whenever I go to any of these places and you see dude's like sleeping in the sand, eating dirt, you know, cuddling their coalition to cough for warmth. And then you look at, look, I'll be the first to put my hand up. You're looking at me and I'm like, well, well I have in and out burger or a Wendy's, I will, I have the supersized coke or the value of them, you know, and I'm just like, you know, I used to, when I was young, I used to think that was a tough guy. And when you see these dudes who literally know nothing but an AK 47 and we'll eat sand, you're like, yeah, I don't want to fight that guy. And by the way, the majority of people I know in our country, why? Because our country is great. You don't want to fight these motherfuckers cause they w they are fucking bad ass and it's like, you know, I think we've had this discussion before but you know when you look at boxing and shit, the tougher the neighborhood, the poor, the neighborhood, the better the boxer. Cause they're fighting for something, they want to get the fuck out. You don't see a lot

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       of Harvard boxers. They're going one, two, three current, you know dad. And it's also, they're used to dealing with violence on a regular basis. They can operate more effectively in those high pressure scenarios. I think that's what we're saying about Russians to these, these are harder people. They're, they're stronger in will and in character because of what they've had to go through. I think if you look at the last, the two longest wars in American history, if you look at Iraq and Afghanistan, and then I remember when Russia invaded Crimea, which is 90% Russian, you know, Fox News was saying it was the first time they've ever gone without a shot and we should go in and where are we going to do? And then you're like, hold on a second, hold on a second. You're talking about going into Russia, which is Russian to fight Russians about taking over a part of Russia.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       You know, the tr traditionally was a part of Russia. You know, we had a hard time in Iraq with not the greatest in the world with a lot of terrorists. We had a hard time in, in, in Afghanistan with the Taliban who aren't even in an army. And in any real sense of the word, you're going to go take on the Russians and Russia's backyard. You're going to get a fucking bloody nose like you have never experienced before. If you're going to do it, you better be ready to go all in. And that's, you know, one of the things that NATO has a thing that if you attack any NATO country, all of NATO then has to go and go with you obviously were a part of NATO. So that means if anyone fucks with an island of Finland or someone fucks with fucking Norway's fishing rights, whatever, we all got to go in and then you're like, well, we better be ready for that and we better understand what the fuck that means.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       Cause guess what, the Russians have been doing fucking power squats with an AK 47 ready to go. Uh, we've been sorta eating pop rocks and drinking coke and fan. I know, I think, I think playstation is better than Nintendo. What's the real with the real difference between us though is economic, right? Like for the law and we rush and they don't know fuck and economy like we do. Right. I mean, look, the thing is no difference as far as like what they can put into the military, into their budget and the resources. Well, you know, Russia and China have always had a different philosophy, which is, may have a lot more of it, you know, so they have more tanks that are Shittier, but they're out of fucking, you gotta shoot 10 of them, you know, Dubai and China used to, that was their thing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       Waves, you know, they'd have waves of people and they would literally, your, your machine gun would over heat kind of thing. So if you look at it, we have the best military in the world, most technologically advanced military in the world. But I dunno what the standing army is and I'm going to get in shit, no matter what number I say, but let's say it's 3 million, right. You know, then you look at Russia, it's probably 30 and if you look at China's probably 300 million. Yeah. I mean, because every, well, I, I believe in China, look it up. I think at one, at one point in China, everybody has to be in the military. They have 1,000,000,003 people. So, you know, but yeah, but that's the thing is, is you can have however many people you want the most technologically advanced military in the world, but if you're fucking with China, you're in trouble.

Speaker 3:          01:11:28       And if you're fucking with Russia, you're in trouble. Then it goes to, well, we have a lot more nukes on them. And then obviously that's not a question you went to. Yeah. That's the worst question you can ever get into the United States armed forces standing army. Let's see how many people we've got. Active personnel, 1,369,000 combat troops was, that's in total as active personnel. It's just the Wiki. Yeah. Cause comp, if you look at combat personnel, it's usually 20% which is a staggeringly low number. It's like 300,000 people's. Whoa. That's terrifying. Yeah. This, uh, that's not good. This idea that we're going to go to war with someone like Russia to, that freaks people out too, because we can't go to worldwide look white gangs. You Go, no, you don't. You can't go to war with Russia because a, you know, whoever, maybe maybe it would be a tie, let's say.

Speaker 3:          01:12:22       But then all those nukes, all you need is one crazy general on either side. One crazy motherfucker to say, you know what, I'm going to doctor strange love this shit and I'm just going to let fly. Yeah, I'm talking to traipse. Love this shit. But do you, do you think that there is an issue though, the difference between going to war with someone who doesn't look like what we perceive to be the quintessential or you know what? I'm typical. I mean, you know what? Yes. But you know what I'm confused about is if you look at America, what would you say the number one security political problem in America is today? Security. Security issue. Security problem. Political. Not Political problem. Like you can't be debt or energy or whatever. Like a political seat though. Like you're secure. Yeah. Okay. We can't be PR and external.

Speaker 3:          01:13:13       External, external, external. We were worried about terrorism. Okay, good. Thank you. That was, what's the number one by by far, way worse than America in Russia today. Terrorism. They have terrorist attacks. You know, they had the theater where they were all killed in the theater. They had, they just had the subway state, they blew up two subway stations in Moscow recently. They had the, the, the, the school where they killed all the kids, right? The AG stands coming up and the Russia, they have these late, they have nine eleven's right. On a yearly basis. Right. Since then you look at China and say, what's the biggest external threat happening in China right now? Right. Terrorism. So western China, the youngers are, the wiggers are fucking going ape shit in northern China and Outer Mongolia. And it's causing a huge, massive, massive problem within China where hundreds and thousands of people being killed and slaughters and bus stops and train stops.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       So just had one recently. And what's interesting is you say, okay, the three major powers in the world, America, China, and Russia, right, all share the exact same number one enemy, which is terrorism within their countries, aligned terrorism. It's the same group, same groups. And then you say, okay, uh, why the fuck wouldn't we just get together and say, hey guys, we have exactly the same m and India by the way, is in there as well. Why the fuck don't we get together and say, hey, this is a huge problem for all of us. Massive fucking problem for all of us and Europe. Put everybody in there and say, why the fuck don't we get together and say, Hey, we've got to solve this one way or tother because it's much the, the deaths by terrorism. I believe our number one, China, number two, Russian number three America. The why the fuck don't we get to go on and say let's do something about this collectively.

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       Number three America. But there must be number three all have in countries that we've invaded to bring us into number three, right? Cause of death by terrorism. I liked the 3000 people that died in nine 11 and what other attacks? You know, a few other,

Speaker 3:          01:15:25       yeah, it would be, it would be a tax on Americans and foreign soil, but in China to continue a war, you have western China, north western China with users in Russia. It's continuing of Dagestan you have and you have all this stuff. And then here, you know, we have all of our, you know, I guess it must include a Afghanistan or Iraq

Speaker 1:          01:15:48       and a, Russia's getting that weird spot right now where their economy is sinking and it was like a free fall. They lost 50% of the ruble. Yeah. In the past two years.

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       Yeah. It's, it's, it's a combination of sanctions and the collapse of oil, which is the majority of their GDP, both of which are blaming on us. Well, how do we fuck with their oil? We lowered the price of it. Right? Isn't that part of what's going? Everyone lowered the price was shale oil and fracking. We have, you know, have done a lot to become energy independent, which I think is a good thing. Um, but the glut of shale cheap, a fracking shale oil has, has driven the price down and OPEC hasn't, uh, uh, decreased supply, which would theoretically increase it. Also problems like, uh, Venezuela and Iran have sort of solve themselves in the sense of oil distribution. Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:16:51       The, when the number of barrels that the United States produces today, it's supposed to be as much or more than anybody in the world. Like we produced this

Speaker 3:          01:17:00       yeah. Oils, anybody. Yeah. We always produced a ton and we just consumed more than we produce because we like to consume shit. Um, you know, but by and large, the biggest security problem I believe that we had, including terrorism, was that our energy dependence upon. So if you look at Saudi Arabia, you say, okay, these guys are actively supporting mosques that say, Wahhabi Islam is good. I e. That you should not, you know, you should adopt a fighting a terrorist. Islam. Um, that was our money, you know? And so at that point, you know, we're giving money to Pakistan, we're giving money to a Saudi, we're giving money to a, we're giving money to Iraq. Why? It's crazy. It doesn't seem sane. But why oil? Because we need to fucking oil and and we need all the oil and you shouldn't need less oil. Yeah, well I think it puts us in a better position.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       It doesn't make them Desperado isn't it better to keep them our hose? Thank God I was running the country. I would, I would continue to, you know that got him on the hotel that that question is being answered right now. That question is being answered in real time. You don't want to go head to head with a hoe, but the thing, it was a check but because of the, because of exactly what you're saying, because of the stratification of that power system. That's why you have isis that way. That's why you have all this shit. Everyone just thinks isis is a bunch of dudes who went out fucking hadn't joined and said, you know what? Why don't we fucking take out Chi this thunder? No, what happened is you have a huge fucking group from all over the world, international fucking consensus coming in there and saying we're going to make a caliphate.

Speaker 3:          01:18:45       And by the way, that caliphate, because there were a hobbyist say we want to take over Mecca once they take over Mecca, if they take over Mecca, hopefully they don't. Then you have a real problem because then you have isis saying we are the pope and fucking Rome. Thank you very much. Is that what they want to do? Is that the only of, Oh fuck yeah. That's why Saudi Arabia has shitting their pants now is because they were funding all these wahabiists things and then an isis goes yet we're wahabiists but where the real wahabiists and we're coming to take Mecca. Why? Because if you run Maca, you run the Sunni world. Right. And so there, Saudi Arabia has a lot more to worry about isis than America does because Saudi Arabia, because there are real close to fucking mech and they want to take it, we need to just get giant cargo planes like those cargo planes were do skydive out of and it filled them to the top with mushrooms and not at the end of it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       You have like a big board where we just push the mushrooms out the back of the plane. What I love is circle what I love is we'll go on the ground with our whole military and fight to them. He was saying, oh, but we were not going to go after. We'll, we'll bomb isis here and there. And you're like, this is as bad as it gets to why he's using this as bad as it gets. Isis is Nazi Germany on fucking steroids, but we're using um, drones, right? That's the idea. They are airstrikes or I should really distinguish that there's, I am not involved in the drone strikes, airstrikes, airstrikes and Mandera strikes. And how many Isis soldiers are there? According to Ben Affleck, there's like 200 dudes. Is he correct. What had been Afflecks say? I don't know who is on the bill Maher show.

Speaker 3:          01:20:25       He had some goofy quote that got chewed apart by Sam. I mean I've, I, so we embedded with isis for four weeks last summer and I interviewed and I hit the brakes. Why'd you say that? So casually, we embedded with isis for four weeks. What the fuck were you thinking? Dude, first of all, I did not say casually. That was, and just assume, I just assume everyone know it was in the world and I didn't know we had something like 45,000,040. Fuck no, fuck no. But we have a filmmaker who, who we worked with in Palestine, um, we asked if we could go see what was happening in, uh, at the time isis now I, so, and we embedded, uh, for four weeks they changed names. The artist formerly known as Isis, it's ice hole now. I, so I like the P diddy on steroids or puff daddy. So we, we embedded for four weeks with them all over in Iraq and in Syria.

Speaker 2:          01:21:25       And we released a, a documentary one, a ton of awards. It was viewed, uh, you know, tens of millions of times, you know, and um, basically we didn't have any commentary. We just pressed record. And uh, I really enjoyed it because of that because it wasn't like look at these fucking cocksuckers, whatever. It was like, Hey, your vales not, cause what they did is they showed us what life under the Islamic state is and it's like, it's like Nazi Germany. It's like you have to have the veil and you can't be too happy and you can't fucking eat too much licorice and all this shit and uh, you know, want a ton of awards for it. We embedded with Isis. I personally interviewed a couple of guys from, my sister was a Canadian guy who was thought to be dead. He was not. And I interviewed him. And what's interesting is, I mean the numbers vary.

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       Um, but the, the top end, but the number the guy was giving me is they 50,000 foreign fighters. Now we know that they have 50,000 fighters. The argument is, is it like 20 or 30,000 foreign and you know, 20,000 Iraqi Syrian or what the, what the mix up is. But these are on the ground fighters. These are not like support troops or you know, logistics or mentality. These are the fucking fighters. So this is why people should sit up and take notice is you have, I mean, for us to mobilize 50,000 fighters is a huge fucking deal, right? But they have people coming from America. We talked to French people in Isis. We talked to Americans, we talked to, I talked to Canadians personally, you know, and we're like, I don't understand. You're from America or from Canada. You're from France or from Germany or from the UK.

Speaker 2:          01:23:15       You're fighting, in my mind anyway, for maybe the worst political organization around, but in their mind, because they've grown up with these well hobbyist, uh, uh, mosques that that's the right thing to do because they need to be well hobbyist in Mecca for it to be true Islam. And that's why I think people should take the next look at Isis because isis is not going away anytime soon because these people id logically believe that they are right. And the question shouldn't be, what the fuck's happening with Isis is the question should be how the fuck could isis recruit 50,000 people in fucking six months?

Speaker 3:          01:23:57       Well, if you think about what the, the image of the United States is and how we've invaded these foreign countries, Islamic countries, and the hatred that a lot of the Islamic radical fundamentalist guys have towards the United States government. If we had a similar enemy to United States, as overpowering as we are, is, is invasive as we are. We have basis in over a hundred countries. Red Dawn, could you imagine bread, wake up those fucking dudes that live in Michigan, white dudes that let all their guns, South Dakota and North Dakota and fucking New Mexico, Jesus Louise's, you know what kind of a fucking army if we were invaded. Yeah, that would be, it would never end if you United States turned hard. Never fucking gave us are super serum or super soldier serums from Captain America movie. Yeah, it would be a country. We're just so fat and so far ahead of the curve, but we would get down with it pretty quick. I mean, well that's what we saw after nine 11 when I already had, but I think, I think that you brought up fucking good point, which is here's a rack,

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       right? And and for a long time we were supporting Iraq and then we'd support it ran their biggest enemy and they wouldn't support a rack again. And then we'd support around. Why? Because we want a cheapo fine geopolitics actually. Who gives a fuck? Actually, you know we're hegemonic power. That's what we have to do. Whatever

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       the problem is is you say, okay, we meet up shit. This is where it gets a bit Wonky, right? Because you're like, if you wanted, if you just told the American people we need to fucking oil and this guy is fucking fucking with oil, I think that would have been better than weapons of mass destruction and going to the UN and trying to get everybody behind it and try it. W we understand that we are geopolitical player where the policemen, the world's policemen, you don't have to make this shit up. But what happened is they said Al-qaida is being supported by Sadam Hussein. Now, anyone want to have a brain knows that alcaide is fundamentalist religion and the bath party was a secular, they were anti religious. They were like political thing. They were, they didn't want religious extremism so they weren't how helping out kind of where are they bad guys is Adamus ain't a bad guy.

Speaker 3:          01:26:11       Yes, I didn't like him. He's not my friend. I don't like him. But was he fucking Osama bin Laden's best friend? No, they were enemies. In any case, we make shit up and we go in there. We fucked shit up so bad for so long that we, when we leave right after the day we leave a co a fucking cadre of motherfuckers come out called Isis, which make Al Chi to look like a fucking tea party and take over the country. Right. It surprising at all. But hold on. So we go in, we made it up. We said the Boogie man lives in Iraq. We fuck it up so bad that when we leave the Boogie man is twice as big. And by the way we made them. Now that is a failure not of our trip, but off the fucking State Department and other political fucking cause. These guys, there was a time when the British could actually say, you know, we can make decisions that we are making decisions that are terribly wrong and the saddest part about that as people are paying for that on our side and on their side with their fucking lives.

Speaker 3:          01:27:07       But isn't that, I mean I'm not in any way downplaying the troops or any military action, but I'm just looking at it from a purely objective point of view. Almost like a mathematics. He's not a cause and effect type situation. I mean you, you enter into our country, you have what is the number of casualties of civilians in Iraq? It's staggering, right? It's like a hundred to one. It's crazy. The amount of that were killed supposedly somewhere around a million. Yes. Including sanctions because we cut off medicine and shit. It's like a million Iraqis. That's a big number. What does anybody in their right mind think the reaction of those people is going to be unless they're so completely detached from those people? On the ground that you don't take that into account at all when you make your decisions. That's my long winded answer to your question, which is if someone did that to America and said, America bombed Russia, we clearly did not bomb rush or we didn't help or whatever, they invaded us, killed a million or 10 whatever the factor is, 10 million to 20 million.

Speaker 3:          01:28:10       Everybody including me and you, we get it. We said we were going to kill those motherfuckers. Yeah, we had all have to get down and that is what's happening now. And then everybody's sitting there going, wow, fuck, we'll just go bomb isis. Those ices motherfuckers cutting people's heads off. Fuck Isis. Fuck Isis. And you're like, I agree. Fuck. I said I'm a journalist. They're going to cut my head off so I don't like them. But at the same time you're sitting there going, okay, why? Why is no one asking? Why is no one asking, how the fuck did these motherfuckers become popular? How the fuck did they recruit guys from Virginia? How did they recruit guys from France? How do they recruit guys from England? Where the fuck are these guys coming from and how did they take over Syria and fucking Iraq? When you have every army in the world, they're in every fucking commando unit and every intelligence agency and these fucking bunch of new guys, new kids on the block took over everybody's shit.

Speaker 3:          01:29:00       And the reason why is because a, there's institutional fucking money funding them. And B, because we fucked up shit bad on our side. Now we should take the learnings that we've done and say, look, Isis isn't going anywhere unless we fucking, you know, go ape shit. Guess what? It's going to make all kind of look like a tea party. Good Lord. Right when you think that he's brought the doom and gloom to the highest level possible, a new watermark emerges. This motherfucker, I actually love life. I know you do that love life. I love you. I love life so much. Look, I eat too much. I drank too much. I hang out with dudes like you. I got to say there's nothing there with drinking too much, but I'll tell you why because there's nothing better in life. And I don't know if you, if you agree with me, but when you get older, besides family, cause family for me is number one.

Speaker 3:          01:29:52       You have, you know your kids, which are everything, but you get a bit older, you know, but it's shit. You have a drink, you have a steak. You talked to somebody and say, look, this is important shit. The greatest thing that we have you and I is that we can talk about this shit and people actually listen to us because I believe that people all over America, North America, Europe are having the exact same discussions. And unless everybody goes, you know what, that's fucking true. These guys are being cock suckers and fuck isis and we got to stop this fucking sea level rise. That's the beauty about what we can do is that we live in a world where we can talk and have a few drinks and say what we believe in. And literally you're, I get it every time like, you know, hundreds of thousands and tens of thousands, Facebook, Twitter, everyone said, okay good.

Speaker 3:          01:30:44       I'm fucking down. What do we do next? I don't fucking know. I'm not Jesus Christ. We're just sitting here and saying, this is what I believe in. This is what I think the greatest thing about our lives is that we live a life where we can have a discussion and it actually matters and people will listen to them. You can say, what do we do next? Well, I think that's one of the things that's held back are all cultures, is the ability to communicate with each other and find out that we're more alike than we are different. We're all just human beings and it was really difficult to have those conversations before. It was really difficult to reach people all over the world and we look at this, you know what? Hold on, look at what you've built here. You've built a communication center. You've built a network.

Speaker 3:          01:31:27       Back in the day, this would be NBC. People would come in and they'd talk to her shit and they'd say whatever they say, and then they leave Walter Cronkite. You literally built that here. Now it's a lot less prohibitively expensive than building NBC. But that's why whenever I come here and I tried to come here, every time I come to la is because this is the future of, it's NBC, but it's NBC for our people. It's on NBC for everyone. Like NBC used to, there was three channels. But one of the things I love about coming here, and this is why I get rankled about censorship, is Joe Rogan has to be able to say whatever the fuck he wants. No matter what. Shane Smith has to be able to say whatever the fuck I want, no matter what you can say I'm wrong. You can say fuck you Shane, I hate you.

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       You're not allowed to shoot me without me. Yeah, but, but like while we have freedom of speech and while we have communication, why don't we have all this shit? We should celebrate the shit out of it and we should tell everybody else out there that they should celebrate the shit out of it because that's what true freedom is. And last we're allowed to say whatever the fuck we want to say. There is no such thing as freedom. There is no such thing as true freedom. If you can't express yourself 100% it's number one fucked of thing. You can buy a gun, you can do this. And if you can't say what you fucking believe without somebody pointing a gun to your head, that was what the Gestapo did. The Gestapo said, you can't say that it will fuck you up. Well, the idea is that they're symbiotic because you need the gun to be able to say, hey, fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       I'm going to say whatever I want. I can protect my body with this weapon, your weapon. It's the only thing that I'm wanting to go to a gun fight whole world. It shouldn't get to the gunfight does. We should be able to say whatever the fuck we want. And that's in violent. And by the way, that's what we should be fighting for when we talk about human rights and when we talk about shit, a lot of time like we were going on, Sadam Hussein was a bad guy. Yeah, there's a lot of bad guy. The Hutus and the Tutsis were fucking kill him the fuck out of each other. The exact same chatty. Exactly. So it wasn't about him being a bad guy because there's a lot of bad guys out there. However, what we should fight for his freedom of speech and that's why he, Charlie up door is an important thing that everybody in the world is coming out.

Speaker 3:          01:33:39       They're not protesting. They're saying, you know what? Everybody should be able to say whatever the fuck they want. And I believe in that. Well, I think anybody who doesn't believe in that as a fool, but there's a lot of fucking people, but there's a lot of people. Did you hear about what the fuck is going on? There was a, there was another attack while this app to this Charlie Hebdo thing is Boko Haram. Yeah. That was 2000 people killed in Nigeria by Islamic extremest. Yes. But we didn't hear about that because that's what I'm saying. Yeah, well that's true. It's not a fucking weird thing, man. That's weak. It's racism and it's Africa fatigue and, and quite frankly, the different issues, right? One of them is attacking someone because of freedom of speech. Yeah. This is, this is some other, there's some other motivation, right? I mean there is sadly, there is Africa fatigue, much like there's Afghanistan fatigue or a rack fatigue.

Speaker 3:          01:34:32       I mean, how about if, let's take a rack for example, we left Iraq and said, mission accomplished, we won good, goodbye. And we left. The story didn't end, but we left. Boom. Isis Bank, biggest story in the world. Oh, well how, where the fuck did these guys come from? Well, if you would, uh, not just slept there, you would have known. And I think that there's Africa fatigue for sure. Like Ebola actually continues to rise. The deaths continue to rise. If we haven't contained it. It's now in Sierra Leone and Guinea and it's fucking getting worse in, in, in, um, in, in Liberia is out of the news cycles. Therefore it must be fucking over. We saw, must have sent the pill. That works. No, the deaths fucking increase. The, the, the, the, the, the, uh, opportunity for contagion increases and, and everybody, that's why we're doing our 24 hour news.

Speaker 3:          01:35:22       And that work cause you're like who gives a fuck about the news cycle? They found the plane so therefore every like who cares? Like when we left Iraq, that's when the problem started and nobody paid any attention while isis built up. You know you look at West Africa and you say Ebola is fucking still raging but now it's fucking the nurse didn't get it in Euston is a world. Okay. I mean there is Africa fatigue, there is Iraq fatigue, there is around fatigue and it's like now we're going to enter into domestic elections and we'll be, we'll be fascinated with what goes on there. Well it's almost like it never ends like this is a fractal equation because as you start looking at all the various aspects of our culture that we could change, it could be better and we look at life and death, but that's just look at the desks that we have in this country because the cigarettes, I don't have anything, any problem with people smoking cigarettes if you truly want to write.

Speaker 3:          01:36:14       But the fact that that's like sort of this ignore if, if everyone stood back, if everyone, like the entire government like had like a holes anti cigarette week where they said in every day on the news they broadcast is special about this is a person who started smoking when they're 16, who either are, when they're 15, getting half their throat removed and show that shit on television. How long would it be before the numbers just radically dropped and the number of people that you saw dead. Yeah, every year radically dropped from cancer. It would be gigantic. Huge. But then we get back into the whole freedom of speech thing, which is, you know, what isn't that freedom of speech? It is free to but like when, when government gets involved in social issues and messaging thing. Well but what's the social issue? But that's a social issue if you look up.

Speaker 3:          01:37:03       Okay, but let's look at the social issue that will say no, that was uh, um, Obamacare, which by the way, calling like a affordable healthcare. Obamacare is funny cause you're just labeling Obama. And if you look at it just as if you take a step back, and by the way, I don't want to get embroiled into it cause I am not an expert. But globally you're like universal health care is like a thing like people you know should be yeah or so health care whenever. Now granted I come from Canada where universal health care when I grew up was good. However that said, I'm not a huge believer in the government running anything because governments I believe, cause I grew up in a government town are inefficient and they spend 80% of the money on themselves and 20% on the thing. So I'm not like a huge believer in government doing anything that said universal care for the richest country in the world seems like fucking we should have it.

Speaker 3:          01:37:59       That became the greatest single debate and probably the worst thing for definitely a Obama, but for sure maybe up there and top five for the Democratic Party and, and, and essentially it was like a thing that if you looked at it in the world context, every rich industrial country as universal healthcare. So it's a boring, it's a fucking given. It's a nothing. And that became such a fucking huge thing because it was the government interfering into your private life. Right. And because of that, the extrapolation became a thing. And I found that to be an amazing litness test on the American psyche because you sit there and say, I mean quite frankly, who the fuck cares, right? You know, how much money were miss spending on healthcare? I get taxed more in America than I did in Canada in Communist Canada. I get taxed more in America and the fucking money gets thrown down the toilet.

Speaker 3:          01:39:00       I, you know, I would, I would be a fucking tea party motherfucker on the taxation side because you tax me the saving Canada, but the schools suck in the hospital, suck, whatever. But you have to have universal healthcare. You cannot be the richest country in the world and have fucking people dying on the street and just rotting there because, well, fuck, you know, they, they couldn't afford it. Now was it implemented? Well, no, it wasn't messaged. Well, no, but the political war that went over over something as stupid as fucking universal, universal healthcare, stupid to argue about. Yeah. Just becomes like, we're going to fucking argue about everything now. Every single fucking thing we are going to, we're going to argue about it. Can we fund the government? We're going to argue about fucking are we going to pay our own debt? We're going to argue about, you know what shoe we put on the right foot versus the left one and that's the problem is if you talk to portray us who now I was up against charges but a secretary gates, anyone, they will all tell you the greatest fear or the great story of the greatest problem for American security is the inaction of the government.

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       The government cannot enact fucking anything and that is the problem that you have today is you have something like like affordable health care act just becoming a huge politicized issue where someone should have just said, look, it's going to cost us 0.01% of the fucking thing to make universal healthcare, which we can't fucking hold her how it heads up. If we don't have just fucking do it was shut up and fucking get on with fucking whatever the fuck else it is. It became the number one political issue of last year. And guess what? It's a nonissue. It's a non issue. We're sitting here, we don't have water, we don't have fucking water. Think already fixed that Bro. Fix it. Fix it. Sell my pipeline pipeline to Antarctica. It's the pipelines of the big ice ICU. No problem dude. You just develop like a funnel. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          01:40:52       And to funnel Marco's, it'll just be like eco warriors with dreads and sandals. Yeah, we would find out that anyway, it's been peeing in the funnel and everybody would get really pissed. Yeah. This is bullshit. There's no, there's no fix. But I think we've been in constant turmoil for so long. I wonder if when something happens like isis or something along those lines where there's a real like military movement against this big machine is America. I wonder if it excites like some sort of garden DNA. Yeah. Got It. Yeah. Cause I know, I know. I know that I'm hunting does, and you know, what else does farming man, you know, growing your own vegetables, there's something about plucking your own vegetables and slicing into it and making a salad with that tomato that amazed that there's something primal. Oh, it's good. I believe that that rule would also tastes better.

Speaker 3:          01:41:42       It does. It does. I was listening to hold on. It probably tastes better just in general. It's probably better for it, you know? But, but psychologically it tastes better because I made that 100%. Definitely. I couldn't agree more, but I feel like VOD could, that I make doesn't tastes better than this. You make vodka. I've made every boozy you, I'll taste it tastes like fucking it's potato. It's just, you can make a still and fermentation and it tastes like everything tastes like Shitty, awful moonshine, terrible vodka. What they do is they just refine away just so it tastes like nothing because you never, I mean, vodka doesn't taste like, hey, just add some shit. And have you ever seen those tests? You know that that doesn't taste like Jack and they put it into the barrels? Oh, they barrels the barrels, stain it and taste it and that's otherwise it would just tastes like fucking bar.

Speaker 3:          01:42:35       Oh alcohol's just alcohol. Right. And add the barrels and the whiskey barrels like coal and stuff. Right. They burn them burn. That's why it's so yummy and it's fucking good. Best Jack 10 is the best. I'm going, you know what Merck, but hold on, you can, you can order all the, the, the super high end shit and whatever else by, I believe Jack is the best tasting, you know, but it's not bourbon. Apparently it's a mash or calm, calm of our great country. I do, I do like Jack, what I was going to say was that someone took a cheap bottle of vodka. I import it through those Brita water filters and did it like seven or eight times and it came out as good as any vodka. Smirnoff always wins. SMIRNOFF's like $5 a leader and it's all and they always win the taste test cause you know why?

Speaker 3:          01:43:21       Cause it tastes like fucking nuts. They put sugar in there. Well, I don't think they put shit and they just put alcohol in there. That is weird. That drinks are not supposed to taste good. They taste good. Yeah. You fucking pussy. What do you got? A little umbrella and you drink in a cherry. That's true. That's true. That's weird. Cause I always, when I was a kid, I used to pretend this says something about the psyche, but I would drink coca cola out of like a shot glass. Oh Jesus Christ kid. And I always thought this is the greatest. And by the way, if they had a drink that was like coca cola but like was like I would drink the fuck out of that. Cause I, I love Coca Cola. I try not to talk about that cause he have an issue with that fucking hate Pepsi don't drink it often will not drink.

Speaker 3:          01:44:10       Jim Norton is the same way by the Pepsi is like a sugary Wa. Coca Cola is the greatest carbolic acid that ever existed. The, the radio. But you know, people used to have the taste tests. Right. I don't know why I'm looking to you for vindication. I took Jamie, they would do the taste test and you'd be like, if you can't taste the difference between coke and Pepsi, you're fucking, I hate your guts because they're completely different fucking thing. In any case, I always pretend and I've always been waiting for a drink that's going to be as powerful and amazing and hit you as hard as a coca cola and every time you have one it's just, mine are really disappointing. I love whiskey. Right? But if whisky tastes like Coca Cola fucking drink alone, you can't. Yeah. If whiskey Tracy like cocoa, we'd have a real problem.

Speaker 3:          01:44:59       It's contrary. You don't have to feel it. I think one of the good things about one of the good things about whiskey or about Tequila, you feel it when it's going down. You know you've done something terrible. Like you take a shot of Jack Daniels and it hits you and just like, well, you brought up a very good point because I just got back from a week in Vegas. Right. And it's a very good point because if you asked me what I really like to drink, like if I wanted to drink, so I like Irish whiskey, I liked shitty Irish whiskey on ice. And then number two would be like, I like to drink. You know, we, you and I like meat. So like I like to eat a steak with a glass of red wine. I think state with a glass of red wine. It was like a reaffirmation of life.

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       Right? But what the fuck do I really drink? I drink vodka soda. Why? Why? Cause it's a fucking drunks, frank. And you can drink when you're at Vegas and you're playing, you can drink 50 vodka sodas and just be like, there's the water in there. It's the purest of the spirit. And was like, if you drink 50 fucking Jack, you're fighting the crew Pa, you're shitting on the floor, you're running a vodka. Soda is like, you're rehydrate. It's a drunk drink. You can drink a vodka soda forever. Also. Do you ever get sick? Like, you know when you're drinking a lot of whiskey at the end of it, you're like, I never want to drink another whisk again. Vodka soda. You wake up the next day and say, Oh, Vodka Soda. Like that's scary because I'm now so old and I've drank so much booze. Then I'm like, well can you drink 5,000 of those cars if you can rank 5,000 of them, I'll go, which is a vodka soda.

Speaker 3:          01:46:37       That seems ridiculous. So you, so you honestly believed that whiskey gets you into fights. I think that's going on brown liquor as a punchy liquor, my friend and you know it doesn't, uh, I come from a long line brick carrying savages or I'm always drank brown liquor, eyes the clear liquor. Brown liquor is a punchy liquor. I don't like the clear liquor. I drink the Mexican version of clear liquor. I don't trust that Russian shit. Well, so Keela we'll keep you up block. We'll keep you up. I'm always been Jack Brown liquor. We'll keep you punching. You know that. That's what the fuck you, why do you think you do a fighter? You got the kettle bells and kicking in the fighting. He's like, Jack Daniel's a poor decision making. I don't think it's the carbon inside the barrel. I mean you yourself said that alcohol is the same effect.

Speaker 3:          01:47:20       It's, it's, it's shine with a bit of fucking burn wood in it. But by the way, it's a gorgeous one of the managers at the comedy store, Terrence has a fuck some fucking ridiculous moonshine that he brought from pack home. Oh yeah. Moonshine to wake you up. But the reason why I like cheap Irish was some, yeah. The reason why I like cheap Irish whiskey, new glasses is a, cause they run it through Pete, which is, you know, bog bricks that they like. It tastes like fucking grass basically. And it's just moonshine. It tastes like grass. I'm like, Oh fuck whiskey. I love it. I just fucking moonshine. GRAPPA is just fucking moonshot. But they put it in the, in the fancy bottles and shit and your lights fucking moonshot. It's disgusting. It's the same fucking thing. Yeah. My grandparents used to have that shit will just drink it after a meal.

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       I don't know. Just to tolerate each other. I've got to say that we've talked about how the world's about 10. I've never felt better about humanity, that I feel bad because I've had a few drinks. I don't know why alcohol is considered a depressant cause I'm fucking euphoric as fuck when I drink it. After the effect, it's, he crushes your immune system. It's immunosuppressant. It's bad for protein synthesis. This Brad is new. Hydrates you, it's, I know it's bad for fat burning. I've experienced that first thing, different kinds of lunchtime. We have the real issue with alcohol is the dehydration and the liver toxicity. Oh, that's it. Yeah. We're doing a piece, actually I can I be fucking, uh, positive for once in my misery life. You do want a piece that's positive. Okay. So my favorite piece I've ever done, I'm doing right now and I was at this, uh, conference.

Speaker 3:          01:48:59       This is moonshine and, uh, well now it's about to get unintelligible if I get into that shit. But I'm going to, so I'm going to try to get my last intelligence story out. So I was at this conference and there was just amazing. Um, uh, I dunno, presentation about a guy who was a researcher, HIV researcher and h they are, they're like HIV, HIV, uh, you know each t-cells, it eats, it eats human cells is amazing at eating shit. It's amazing at eating. Sell moonshine. Now you're going to get me fucked up. I'm going to start crying again. So what are you saying? AIDS. You have aids.

Speaker 3:          01:49:47       Okay. So whoa, that's good. That's actually the best shit. That's pretty good. I have here. That's a real God damn America again. Like I'm going to have one more before I finished this. By the way, the story is going to fuck you up. So everybody turn it up now because this is important. Okay? Okay. So they figure out HIV is amazing at eating t-cells, right? So they say, what if like a pit bull, we starve the HIV and then we only feed it cancer, right? Guess what happens? It's fucking works like a charm. So they starve the HIV, they genetically reintroduce it. So if it, if HIV doesn't eat your t cells, it's not a problem to you, but at each cancer, so it's a cancer reader. So I'm watching this thing go and hold on. When HIV AIDS, cancer, cancer, each HIV, HIV is an EAD or HIV, each cells, right?

Speaker 3:          01:50:39       So like why don't we starve it for t cells and feed it cancer cells. And it worked. In fact, they'd been in four years of trials, a hundred percent success, right? And it's going to, it's, it's a blood cancer, so it's a leukemia. And so what, what happened? So I started saying, well holy fuck cause my mom had cancer and my step mom died of cancer, of everyone's had somebody affected by cancer. So I'm like, Holy Shit, they reengineered HIV to go out and any cancer. And then they're like, well actually now what they're doing is a reengineering viruses for different cancers. So for example, the Mayo Clinic re, re, re, uh, engineered measles and they're injecting like a billion measles into a bone cancer in the bar. And you see a PR, one woman had, uh, a golf ball size tumor in her head. And then like the injector with measles and the fucking measles eat the cancer, like eat it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       And so the, the, the, the, which was previously an operable just goes away. What the fuck? So there's, there's, in Houston they're doing it, uh, in, in, in Mayo Clinic in Penn state. And uh, in Ottawa, Canada, the guy who first discovered it was a guy who came across this paper where hookers, who used to get cervical cancer, all she used to get rabies because a, they were living in squalor. So they would inject the women with rabies. And then there were cervical cancer would go away because the viruses eat to cancer. So this is, by the way, I'm, I must be drunk because I'm giving you my biggest scoop on HBO that's coming up on our new season. But, so I went to interview all these doctors. I went to say like, what the fuck's going on? And they've re-engineered these viruses that used to kill us, right? To go eat cancer. And I'm like, is this the first step, not just for a treatment that isn't, um, a radiation or, uh, um, go on pharmaceutical base. Yeah. Chemo, Chemo, Chemo, uh, but actually, uh, uh, know, uh, treatment that doesn't fuck you up and that, yeah. And puts it you in recession, they're like, we're looking at the first step towards a cure. So this is the biggest story

Speaker 1:          01:52:54       or the opening scene in 28 days later.

Speaker 3:          01:52:59       Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Right, right, right, right, right. Well, they actually, so they re-engineer, they reengineer the virus. The virus, for example, the measles virus actually comes from 1953 and it's the kid whose throat culture they took that we've been using as a measles virus for the last however long these guys in Houston or using a cold virus, which were all immune to the HIV one, they actually reprogram so that it doesn't, uh, uh, eat our t cells. But what's incredibly interesting about that is these guys figured out that what happened was cancer puts our immune system to sleep and so that viruses activate our immune system. So the virus just goes into the cancer, says, here it is. And then the immune system goes and eats it. So for the past six months, I've met the top five or six medical teams in the world as they explain this shit to me and I'm thick as fuck. So I didn't get half of it. But what's interesting about it is the first step to curing cancer caused by the shit that used to kill us because measles used to kill like 150 million people a year. It was a fucking worst thing you could get. Now the measles brings all the fucking white cells and eats the cancer. It's absolutely fantastic. And that's my happy thing before we get drunk on the moonshine. Give you some more on that. Excuse me.

Speaker 1:          01:54:24       That's insane. Yeah, that makes sense. And it also seems terrifying because if they fucked that up, then you got some crazy,

Speaker 3:          01:54:29       well they go through incredible protocols and I wish I could just show you this stuff, but I'm covered in NBC Dwu suits and Shit. They go through very, and the uh, you know, the, they're, they're, they're making sure that the viruses are done in the correct way and stuff, but I've got to say, oh yeah, but how it all happens is there, they're like, it happened by mistake. Like it happened by like, oh, this fucking we're working on HIV. That thing actually eats cancer, you know? And, and I think that, you know, when I look at stuff, I'm like, we can solve these problems. We can fix these problems. When we get on here, we're always like, wow, fucking Russia as this and isis is this. We can fix the problems. We just have to foot people on it. And My, you know, Larry Page always says the guy runs. Google is always like, that's a zero million dollar problem. Meaning if it's a problem, only if you put zero million dollars into, you pick up $1 million and the guest what you saw,

Speaker 1:          01:55:27       zero million dollar problems. Yeah. There's a lot of those to the lungs, just on purpose. And I don't mean on purpose, meaning there's some sort of a grand scheme, sort of a, the overlying conspiracy to the way the world runs. I often wonder the way people behave, even the way you see people behave when they, when they know they're in a relationship where their husband's never going to leave or their wife has never going to leave, or they know they're in a job. Like there's certain college professors when they get tenure become preposterous human beings. And one of the reasons is that they can't get fired. They have this really ridiculous power and people tend when they have power to explore the limits of it. It's just, it's almost an inherent, yeah. I've been listening to the last and it was like maybe the fourth or fifth time in just the last year that I've listened to this Dan Carlin series on the Mongols.

Speaker 1:          01:56:23       It's a wrath of the cons that's on hardcore history. This podcast is to change cause I'm fascinated. It's the greatest. If Dan Carlin's podcasts is the greatest podcast the world's ever known, it shouldn't be called a podcast cause it's too good. It's, it's, it's this, it's essentially a dramatic version of like history and not just the Margoles but everything from like world war one to do. There's so much shit to, this guy covers in such as incredible dramatic fashion. But as I'm listening to these tales of carnage and conquest and all, and I'm wondering like, what the fuck is it that compels people to, to, to operate in this way? Like what is it about someone who gets in power and abuses that power, whether it's a priest or whether it's a, you know, a politician or a police officer. Great question. What the fuck is it?

Speaker 1:          01:57:10       Like, is it just something that [inaudible] like ingrained in us to resist, like to, to have the strength to resist opposition so that when the opposition isn't there and you have ultimate power, you spool up your power to ultimately resist opposition again, it's like you gather up your resources when you have control. Yeah. I mean it almost seems like this weird sort of a, a cyclical thing that's very difficult to escape. Yes. Very, very difficult to escape. And I think that that's, that's the one thing that troubles most of us, most of us rational thinking. People who live in urban environments or don't have to worry about anything other than like normal, petty bullshit, they occasional crime. What we're worried about is like, what the fuck is going on in the Congo? What the fuck is going on in Afghanistan? What the fuck is going on in Crimea? What? What? What are these, these worlds that we don't ever want to see in, in fucking Tribeca? What are these worlds that we see?

Speaker 1:          01:58:14       Right? We're on the right page at the right time. I'm just going to give you one anecdote of exactly that, which is I believe we're sort of the same kind of guy. We grew up in the same year. It's way different than you bitch, settle down while you're away. Tougher and stronger. You're way more bold anywhere. You're a fucking button. World Traveler. I had a real and occasional I had her. I still am going to take you to find, by the way, remember one of the last times I was on here, I like, we should go to Liberia

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       to find the aids island of the monkeys to guess what happened. Ebola. So it's a good thing we didn't go aids a bully, bully, bully eats everything. Maybe we need aid, state aid. I'm really not worried about aids. I'm going to tell you that I'm worried about Ebola. I was worried about it. I'm not even worried about it. Paul. I'm worried about the flu. You know why? Because I flu kills more people than the goal every fucking year. Not really number one killer before World War One was, you know the flu. You know what the number one killer, almost universally the entire history of the human race's death, malaria, malaria and old hills and all day, all day. Just all day I'm at, I'm at midnight of my ecological, environmental and a whatever it is, evolutionary clock. So I'm fucked. But if I could just hold on, but you brought up an amazing point and I just, because I had to deal with this recently and it was a big t, you sober up and listen to the podcast for you make tests team.

Speaker 3:          01:59:36       It was a big epiphany for me when I said I have a penis. No, it was, I woke up one night and uh, you know, I used to sleep fucking, you know, 12 hours later. Now I wake up, I don't know why, but I woke up and it was my daughter's first day of school. Right. And so, you know, I got to take my daughter to the first day at school and I was thinking about school and I'd always been like, you know, I went to sort of public school, rough schools and I think that's where I got to where I am. Because schools just bullshitted to curriculum everywhere you go. But you learn to pecking order, you learn a lot of other shit besides the fucking one plus one equals two. You learn where you are and what you do and you learn how to fight.

Speaker 3:          02:00:16       You learn how to not fight and do whatever you want in any case. So I was thinking a lot about my daughter going to school because she's has a different life to me cause I, you know, I grew up poor and she has a different life to me. And then I was thinking, you know, my daughter now is about to go to school for 25 fucking years. You go to school for 25 years. Why? Because you want to have a career. What's the career? While a career hopefully is something that you like doing and you make some money and maybe you make a difference or at least you convinced yourself you make a difference and you know you're making enough money to maybe buy a house and maybe you can retire somewhere warm cause fucking cold makes your arthritis right. He can, I'm literally thinking about like life, you know, cause cause you, you know, like I went to school and then I worked and then you've got a career and then you tried this and you did all this shit.

Speaker 3:          02:01:04       And I had been at war. I realize I've been at war since I was five years old. I fought every kid in the school yard and then I tried to get in the fucking this and I tried to play football and whatever the fuck else. I was always a war. I was at war with my brother. We fought every day of our lives, and then when I got out of school, I started a company. That company, I was always at war, right? All of a sudden I woke up one day, okay. I went to school, I got my career, I got to work with my best friends. I became a billionaire, right? Doesn't happen. I got the a plus. I got the fucking a plus and I'm sitting there going, okay, I don't have to go to school anymore. I don't have to work anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:01:45       I don't have anything to do anymore. I can move to fucking my private island, put my Amedeus. We gone put the fucking pony tail, but plug up the ass and ride my fucking horse into the sunset. Just got real. Now why are you getting up in the morning? What do you have to fucking do? Why are you doing it? And they'll look at you. You are a fucking big star on TV or the number of fucking voice of the MMA. You're got a huge comedy career going and you do whatever the fuck you want to do. You're done. You won, you won. You got an a plus in the game of life. You got an a plus. I got an a plus. Guess what? I don't have to do anything, right? I have no more chips on my shoulder. I have no more demons to exercise.

Speaker 3:          02:02:24       What the fuck gets me up in the morning, right? And then I said, you know what gets me up in the fucking morning fun doing this shit with you going out there and saying, hey, by everybody you can listen to me or not. But ANTARTICA is fucking melting. And if I don't say something about that, then I can't look. My daughter in the eye when I feed her, her Kraft macaroni and cheese would be burger for conviction as good for you. It isn't, shouldn't give those kids. I, I most of it, but I can't look my fucking kids in the face unless I say, guess what? We got to fix Washington doesn't work. We got, we have to fucking do something about global warming or we're all foc to now me and you were still going to be okay. We'll be all right because I'm much long, longer live, but our kids, and by the way, and I love your kids and you have beautiful kids and I have beautiful kids in our family.

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       We love our kids. I, I don't give a fuck about me. I had a lot of tough on, I did a lot of coke and drag it out of booze and had a lot of sex and all that shit. But you're like, guess what? Like we, you know, and so at this point you're like, I can either ride off into the sunset and say, fuck it. I'll sit on an island beach and I'll drink fucking miss gala every day. Or you can go out there and say, no matter what, I'm going to kick against the pricks. I'm going to say this ain't fucking right by the way. What you're saying is bullshit. I'm going to go talk, by the way, I'm going to go interview Putin, I'm going to interview and I'm going to say, what the fuck are you doing? And by the way, guess who I'm interviewing after Puente.

Speaker 3:          02:04:00       I'm interviewing Obama and I'm going to say what the fuck's going on? Why? Because why the fuck not? And that's why I always get excited about coming on this show is because this show is democracy in action. You have millions of fucking people listening. And guess what? Unless we say something, unless we wake up from our volume and booze induced stupor, nothing's going to fucking happen. So why the fuck are you doing it? That's the question you should ask yourself from 2015 not am I going to lose weight now I'm going to read more fucking books, not am I going to go wear sketchers instead of Nike's. It should be. Why the fuck do I

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       get up in the fucking morning and now we're very lucky motherfuckers that were posed economic and we can fucking say, I'm going to get up in the morning because of this.

Speaker 1:          02:04:47       I like how the 1% is relabeled themselves post economic.

Speaker 2:          02:04:52       Well, I'm the newest, I'm the newest of the 1% and I'm giving it all away. Cause I, I'll tell you one thing. Money means a fuck of a lot when you don't have it. By my old man told me the only thing that ever made any sense about money, he said, life is like your shit sandwich. The more bread you have, the sheet you have to eat. But once you get it, once you get that a plus, she just say, fuck it. You know what I'd like to do? I would like to buy 20 million acres. We'll say no one's allowed to fuck with that. You can't fucking do shit with that fucking land. I'm just gonna fucking leave it because that's one of the only things you can do. That's a pure good. Just leave the land. Don't fucking mine it. Don't fucking pison and don't shit in it. Don't put Joe's tuna, bards and Tequila boom, boom room in there. Just leave it fucking gorgeous because fucking that's, that's that's God had to me is nature.

Speaker 1:          02:05:39       Well I think one of the things that's changing in our world is that more people have uh, the ability to communicate. They might not be able to communicate on the scale that is like a podcast like this, but they have the ability to express themselves to us. And maybe, you know, if you are on Twitter or Facebook or you, you, you ran into him in some form of social media, you might read what they said and take it into account. So something about them trying to express themselves has some sort of a meaning. One of the things that has the most impact for those people is someone who can reach millions of people who represents their points of view. Because most of our field guys, I'm, that's not happening. Rogue and Brian, Stan, he was on my podcast this week. He can, when I can, I don't have skeletons. I got graveyards. This guy. I'm pretty sure if you have graveyard concentration camps were all good but all be your office or your breath or your press secretary to warm up for my workout. I'm not into one.

Speaker 2:          02:06:42       I would say to everybody out there, the Joe Rogan would be the greatest political candidates.

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       No, no. It'd be terrible because I have other shit I want to do. I'm not going to stop commentating for the UFC. I love that. I'm not going to stop doing standup. I love that. I'm not going to stop podcasting. I'm not going to stop hanging out with my kids and taking care of my family. So where's my time? Well that's true. It doesn't exist but, but this is just, it's not just as good as being a president, but it's, it's far as like what I can do with who I am and what personality I've sort of developed along this path of life. If I wasn't me and I saw me and I said, hey man, you should talk about this shit cause this is kind of weird. This is kind of fucked up. My obligation is to do that. And your obligation that as well.

Speaker 1:          02:07:26       And I think that's what you're saying. I used to play pool like it did to a degenerate level. High fashion. Well I never played professional but I played some [inaudible] whacked out. You were good. You were good. I wasn't good to compare it to people that were good. But my point being, I know you were a good cause you played with it. The people that are really good at pool, almost universally they're gamblers almost universally all I'm a, there's a few guys in Europe but the American players like almost all of them, what they call match up and the guys who are the best, they always look at pool as what the ultimate thing is winning. And what money is is just fun. Coupons. Yeah, just pull coupons. You pass those back and forth. You don't worry about the money. You're trying. I'm not trying to accumulate money. Well you're trying to do is when the big score,

Speaker 3:          02:08:14       I worried about money a lot cause I, I left home at 14 and I was broke and I worried about the top 14, 14 and I worried about when I left home I was a bad guy. How bad? Fairly medium. No medium guy. I was medium bad because I, you can't be that bad in Ottawa, Canada, but I was as bad as it gets. Um, but I got to say like, you know, money consumed me for a long time. A M B I had a big old chip on my shoulder. I would say what? What fueled me for 75% of my life was spite because I would say I'm going to fucking do this. And they'd rolled her eyes and say, Shane, you're a fucking arse hole Shane your bullshit or whatever. And like just recently I'm, when I'm going to launch a news network and they're like, oh fuck Shane, you piece of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:09:03       Fuck you. Same family. No Mom, my family, your family. My family is awesome. I haven't my family. No, no, I'm just saying people, people on the world compete it a, sorry, sorry. But you let family's house when you were 14 yeah, but not because they were mean or shitty cause it was crazy. Yeah. I was a old 14 yeah. But I was like, I was like, Nah. It was the same height I am now. I looked old. I was working as a bartender. I was, I was screwing chicks so older than me. I was getting drunk. You were a bartender at 1414 well this is Canada to back in the fucking day when it was like, well, right. Who gives a fuck? And it was, I was a punk kid by the way. I had a great time bartending at 14 and sling and coke and stuff. But the thing is, is like, whoa, whoa, you slump coke at 14 yeah. What? When, but when, don't use slang. Coca 14

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       no, funny that is, you're like, yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:09:57       well I learned, I'm all my business acumen being a drug dealer because it's pretty fucking simple. You have to make a margin and you have to do this and you have to mitigate risk and all this stuff. And then it went to eastern Europe and I sold money, bought and sold money because you can make money, a lot of money on arbitrage. Right? So the thing is is money was outsized for me for a long time. It was just, it was, it was, it was a monkey on my back. And, and success was based on money. Whenever, now the most arrogant fucking thing in the world you can say is, I don't give a fuck about money. Right? Because guess what? Everybody gives a fuck about money because that's how you eat. But the one thing, and it was Spike Jones, actually, we, when we go away, every once in a while we go to the top of the mountain and we fucking talk about shit and I, and, and he was like, you're too concerned about money because I am literally a poor guy who was concerned about money and he's literally a guy who never give a fuck about money.

Speaker 3:          02:10:53       And that's why he's more successful than I am. Wait, wait, Whoa, whoa. Just say guys, more successful than you. After you said you're a billionaire, let me turn this up. But no, no, but hold on buddy. Richard and a billionaire can go fuck himself, but I'm going to tell, I'm going to tell you something about being a billion, a billion or it doesn't mean anything because guess why? Well, why? Well, I'm going to tell you I'm going to, that's a budget horseshoe, but hold on. I'll tell you why. Because I'm going to give it all. Well, I'm not going to give it all away and we're going to buy a bunch of land because I believe in nature. I love seeing people compete for it. Yeah. And die and I'm just going to leave it. That's going to be my thing. But what I will say is, it's true, it's true.

Speaker 3:          02:11:30       Money won't buy you happiness, but guess what? Your family not having to worry about where the next rent checks coming from. You know, being able to fucking feed your kids, all that shit. That is important. Incredibly important. It takes the stress away, but more importantly it goes, okay, now take all that shit out of the equation. What the fuck are you going to do today, right, with everything you know, look at you. You're a powerful guy. You got all these people listen to you. What are you going to do? Guess what? Joe Rogan could say, fuck you. I'm going to drive my fucking car. I'm going to go bow hunting. I'm going to fucking go to uh, [inaudible] and fucking lie on the beach. What are you doing? And you're fucking sitting here with me doing the back to back podcast, talking about shit, challenging people, putting information to people's minds.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       I don't have to ever work again. Why am I sitting here on the fucking Rogan? But I could be doing USA today. I can be doing fucking 60 minutes. Why am I doing the Rogan podcast? Because this Anderson Cooper hit on you because I heard, because this is important and we always get to this at the end of the day, is there is a movement of likeminded people who have the a plus who go, I don't give a fuck about da plus. I don't give a fuck about the money. I don't give a shit about you are fucking, you are fucking biggest star and I'm forget the network, but come on. What's the net where ABC, CBS, NBC thinking about is what are you doing now? You're literally hold on. You're literally spending your own fucking money to have shit heads like me. Come on here and talk to people.

Speaker 3:          02:13:00       I know every time we get drunk, which I am now, I get all boozed up and says, but this is democracy in action. This is important. And by the way, you took your a plus and said, I'm going to do my own thing, bitch. I took my a plus and said, I'm going to do my own thing. Bitch. We're not Brad Pitt or George Clooney accepting our Golden Globe lifetime achievement award, but guess what? Millions of people are saying, hey, how the fuck can we change the shift that you're talking about on the rogue insurance is the thing that people like least about us when we're drunk, we just compliment each other. They're like, hey, Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan sucks, but I've got to say, can you try and go? I've got to say, if Joe Rogan and I don't get along, then the world will land.

Speaker 1:          02:13:41       No, we'll be fine. We'll all be fine. As I've gotten older, one of the things that I've really come to grips with is in this really strange way is that we, for this brief glimpse that were awakened alive, we're really just a blip in this infinite number of blips and w what I, everybody worries about their own finite nature. It's one of the things that troubles all of us and I'm, I'm one of those people. It's just impossible to avoid. I think anybody that doesn't, it's not troubled by the idea that you know, you only have a certain amount of days and hours and minutes on this earth before. Eventually this vehicle shuts down and stops working. Like what? What? What, what are the things that are important to you, why you're here and what's important you, why are you here is trying to spread what I would call harmony would, I would try to call this, this community communion with each other.

Speaker 1:          02:14:35       The ability to develop really honest, friendly relationships and I think a lot of what we have, whether it's issues with Muslims or whether it's issues with Christians or whether it is, I think a lot of the issues that we have across the board with human beings, with various ideologies is a lack of communication, a lack of understanding that at the end of the day we're like each other more than we're different and what separates us and what what you're talking about. And the good thing about having financial independence is that once you have financial independence, it releases you in a way that's indescribable. The people that are caught up in the, the constant, very common web of, of, of existence. It's fired existence. It's hard. I had a developments yard when I was, I was 26 years old and I got a development deal to come to California and do this television show.

Speaker 1:          02:15:30       And when I, when I got it, I got to check and it was a flick for like $150,000 or something along those lines. And immediately it was like the whole world just, just relaxed. Like I knew, you know, my rent was like 600 bucks or something like that. I knew I could pay my rent now. I knew I could eat now. I knew, I knew I made 500 bucks in the average week doing stand up. I knew I could eat, I could pay my rent, I could eat. And it was like this. Whoa. And I remember sitting in my shitty apartment in new Rochelle, New York, and I had this weird epiphany when that happened. I was like, Whoa, this is like the biggest relief I've ever had in my life. Not I'm not rich by anybody's standards, but all of a sudden now I'm a, I'm slightly ahead of the run.

Speaker 1:          02:16:15       And again, I can stop and I can really, I could look at the struggle behind me and I'm like, oh, we're caught up and we're caught up in the momentum of debt. We're caught up in the momentum of stress. We're caught up in the momentum of having to every this and that and every week worry about did they gonna shut my lights out, all my cable bill fucking writing checks and all that stupid shit that people do all day. And as soon as you can step away from that, then you start to look at your life and going like, what is my life like? This just constant worry about this impending tide of bills and pushing them back.

Speaker 2:          02:16:50       Yes. So

Speaker 1:          02:16:52       the one thing, the responsibility that I think a person like you has or a person like I have, is that once you are slightly ahead of that wave to let people know what it's like, let people know what's going on up here. And also let people know, like you're being misled. This doesn't last forever. The a sled, that the whole thing, knowing your, because we're all being misled. You're saying what you're saying is a hundred

Speaker 2:          02:17:15       I was so caught up in bills and money and buy him shit and not buying shit and being broke for so long that I got a, I got consumed about cash and you're exactly right when you have this. It could be a hundred grand, it could be whatever. It could be. Vegas could be, I doesn't matter what it is. But you get it and then you go, oh all that time I spent worrying about it all that time I was freaked out all that time. Like it's just a construct. We make it up it money. Is it just a bunch of fucking computer fucking blips on the screen and then when you get it you realize, and this is Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. I know how arrogant it is to say, but at the same time you're like fuck like all that time cause I'm stupid.

Speaker 2:          02:18:07       All that time I was trying to chase the money. I should have been trying to chase something else. I don't think I'll tell you, but hold on. I'll tell you what I mean, because you know Spike Jones, who I love more than anything, you know, he made adaptation being John Malcovich every fucking award, winning music, video, every award, winning fucking commodity. Everyone most, most and Eddie Kansas flow was I doing, I was trying to make money. We actually want to, I'm one of our go to the mountain things. It was like take money out of the equation. What would you be doing? And you know what I said I'd be doing news cause that's the only shit that I really like doing anymore. Guess what I did after that? I started news channel and news is stupid. He can't make money. You can't do thing. It's not gonna work. You can't start a new news channel. We're the fastest growing news channel in the fucking world, Joe.

Speaker 1:          02:19:02       Yeah, but why? Why does everybody say you can't make money in the news?

Speaker 2:          02:19:05       Cause everyone's dumb. But everyone will tell you, you can't do something. We've talked about this before. Everyone will tell you you can't do something to tell you do it. And then they'll say, I always knew you could do it. But the thing is, is because it's difficult to do. We have, we're bigger than NBC and CBS News, uh, combined on our online, uh, viewership or the largest and growing news agency in the world. Everyone told me I would fail. Every single person without fail, without exception, told me I would fail. The reason why we didn't is because everyone's doing such a shitty job were telling us that the images, but I will say this about spike. He said, take money out of the equation. What would you do? Assign going to do news. He goes, if that's what's gonna get you up in the morning, go to fucking news and tell everyone else would go to hell, which is what I've been doing, which is why we've been getting a little bit of trouble because now it was like, I like vice news and I don't like the other vice anymore. But there you go.

Speaker 3:          02:19:57       People like vice news where they don't like the other vice. Well because vice when we came up was like Poopoo Caca in the book. Crazy vice provides, you know, and now the robot naked, that kind of shit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:20:07       But now news became so big overnight, vice news and vice are now fighting each other for being how big they are. And so now know like people are like, I don't want to see people khaki in the bump moms, or I don't want to see your music shit or your travel shit. And I'm like, well then just turn into vice news. Don't turn and do the other shit. But the fact is this news became so fucking big that it's now coloring the rest of the brand because the rest of the brand needs to be used to be everything. And now everybody just wants fucking news. Which by the way, I love news, but I still like all the other shit too.

Speaker 3:          02:20:41       You know the problem is it's not even everybody that's complaining. That's not really the problem. The problem is access. The problem is you shouldn't have 300 million in America plus worldwide have access to just throw Twitter comments up and Facebook comments and youtube comments because I'll come, even though it's not bad, it's not bad, but it's overwhelming in the sense that it's very, very difficult to manage. It's almost impossible to manage those numbers. So you're going to get people that complain. Some of them was, some of their complaints are legitimate and some of their complaints are just to get your attention and the best way to get your attention to tell you you're shitting the bed. You're fucking up. You're doing badly. You're disappointing them. It's not as good as the old device. The old vice was better. I'll tell you two things about that and the, and that's exactly right. No, but I'll tell you two things about that. I'll get a hundred things and you're changing the world. You're changing newsroom. And one thing saying you fucking cock sucking cock sucker, all fucking meet you at 59th and seventh I'll kick your ass. So A, B, and this hits on.

Speaker 2:          02:21:45       All right, well I dunno about you, but about me and my life is that you sit there and you say, you know, I, I started, I had a small company before and, and, and it was 10 people in a room and you're like, Joe, or you got the fucking photo and fucking Ted. Do you have the thing? And fucking Rosalia and now we're doing something on the order of 14,000 posts today. And everyone's like, shame, did you fucking see what fucking Vice Bulgaria put up in that Goddamn bullshit? And Germany just said that, this and that and whatever else. And you're like, I'm sorry, but I'm lucky if I see posts a day and we do 14,000 and that's the problem with running something is that you go when it was just me, it's easy when it becomes, I don't know how many people even have 4,000 employees, some shit.

Speaker 2:          02:22:40       You're like doing 14,000 posts. It sucks. And I've got to say like when it, when it is just you, it's you and, but then, then it's not advice then it's not a thing. It's just me. And, and you know what I'm trying to do now or what vice is trying to do now is to have much more of a cohesive point of view. And, and ironically, how we're going to do that is we're buying TV networks around the world. We're going to make TV shows with them. We then push up for the first time ever day and date with, with uh, an online and mobile. No one's ever done it before and we believe we'll have the largest uh, uh, audience in the world online, collectively online, mobile and TV. And then the question is, okay, great, what are you going to put in there? What you, we don't want to put it in shit just between the ads.

Speaker 2:          02:23:32       We're like, okay, who wants like all over the people that the spikes and the harmonies and the use and the whoever else. Now we're saying like we can put whatever the fuck we want out to the largest audience in the world. We just don't want to put shit out there because why the fuck are we getting out of bed in the morning and that is going to be our 2015 and that is why I believe I'm positive because I'm going to give it a shot. I might fuck up, I might not do a good job, but at least I'm going to have that shot and we're going to go out. We're going to try to do something that doesn't suck.

Speaker 1:          02:24:05       Well, there's a bunch of people that will complain about anybody in any position of power that is either above them or has more influence in them. But if there's a person that you, you would be like, oh, that guy got it. It was a person that would be, I would be relaxed in a position to disseminate information. It'll be you. And again, this is more of what most people hate about the show is us sucking each other's dicks. But you're a, you're a genuine gangster. I know you do all this crazy shit even though you have money and you can do whatever you want. You don't cow town and you don't suck up to the corporations. And it's weird as the position that you're in is, I wouldn't want anybody else doing it other than neo because most people would play it safe.

Speaker 2:          02:24:48       I gotta say one thing. When we announced anything big, we'll announce it on Joe Rogan. Why I'd be on hold on. Why? Cause literally, and we've said it before and I would challenge somebody to watch the directory of these podcasts because we're going to launch one of the largest TV networks in the world. We'll launch it on the Joe Rogan show. Why? Because we're the same. Why the fuck would we launch it on today's show or whatever the fuck it is or who the fuck cares? And by the way, you only live once. We work with our friends, we do with our friends. And by the way, we are the new audience. Oh I, I'm one thing I'd like to save for anyone who gives a shit because I think for a hundred people who say fucking Rogan and Shane doing stuff is good. When people say you're so self congratulatory, the reason why is because Joe's a real guy.

Speaker 2:          02:25:36       This is a real fucking dude came fucking up. I'm a real guy. We came up and half of it is us looking around going, can you fucking believe this shit? Can you believe where we are today? We're sitting here having a conversation with two mutual fucking dudes would just have anyway, and millions of people are listening to us on guests, but we're going to announce the fucking, the next wave of media in the world together. Why? Because we can and guess what? If we don't celebrate that we're the first fucking generation that's ever doing that, then we should fuck off. I Dunno. I'm getting weird. No, you're not getting signals. I'm getting fucking weird thing was black for a second there on the screen, but I look not just to be a human being. The fact that you and I are having this conversation to freakazoids who would never be on anything any fucking other way. I'm even if we get in shit for it, I'm going to say it every time because if I'm going to ever do anything in, announce anything I'm going to do on the rogue and show why. Cause Joe Rogan is the fucking man and because guess what? I love him and that's all the fuck up

Speaker 1:          02:26:39       each other again. I try to avoid them done. Now I'm over. Everyone can fuck off. The world's about 10 it's not. We're going to be okay, but I, I see what you're saying and it sort of aligns with what I'm saying is that where we find ourselves in very unique positions that we didn't expect to be in and those positions happened because it was just all, everything along. I don't need to do this podcast. You don't need to do this podcast. Why the fuck do you do this, Bob? I want to have a conversation like this with you. If you and I had a conversation at a restaurant, if we had a, it would be 15 to 20 minutes of your insane trips about the world. We would laugh, we would tell jokes, but there's an awareness. The fact that this being broadcast that makes us stay on point and focus on some and occasionally a little dick sucking every now and then something, but I don't, I don't like that whole Dick Sucking thing. Not that I don't like Dick Sucking criticisms of us. What? Hold on.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       I would say the hundred people saying, I love the the Rogan podcast versus the one Dick sucker. The one thing I would just like to say is what I'm doing is saying that this is the first time in media history or conversations like this can happen and I don't think that's fucking

Speaker 1:          02:27:53       Dick Sucking on it. I think because of a lack of censorship and that's one of the most important theories about what's going on there. There you go. Exactly. Don't don't criticize people, Zack, you think they got it wrong with their take or their humor, their satire. No. Criticize the people that are trying to silence dissent, that are trying to silence other people's criticism. Satire criticized those people. Don't criticize the people that were making cartoons or

Speaker 2:          02:28:18       we should celebrate the fact that two motherfuckers can sit there and go out there

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       and say whatever the fuck they want and people can listen or not listen, and it's never happened before. This is very rare. Never happened before. Not only that, anyone can do this. Any guy right now who has an iPhone, I mean Dunkin, I and Ari and I, we've done many podcasts on planes. When we're sitting next to each other, well, one of the one of us will hold the phone up in between the armrest and we'll just talk and we'll have a podcast on a plane. You know what the also the big difference is hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are out there. It used to be, maybe it's three, four, five, six. This is now a movement. And that's why like whenever I come here, I have to go see fucking Rogan. Why a we're friends be I love your family. See like I don't want to go talk to anybody else.

Speaker 3:          02:29:09       I don't give a fuck about anybody else. So I'm not, I'm going to stop with the Dick Sucking. But, but I would like to say this is the celebration of free speech and I give you total Kudos because you don't have to fucking do this. You don't have to pay for this place and do all this stuff. Yeah. But I'm always blown away that you do and I'll stop there. That's very nice. But I do because anyone who couldn't but all of a sudden was given the opportunity would, and that's exactly the situation I find myself in and all of it is played out for all of us in a, in a very unique way that none of us could have planned out, including just the average person that is on Facebook or Twitter that sends a message that you respond to or I respond to or anybody Dunkin or anyone responds to.

Speaker 3:          02:29:54       We're in this weird error of [inaudible] that's never existed before and we were a part of it as much as anyone else and were a part of it and that we represent that even though you, you know, you do make a a lot of money or you do pay a lot of taxes, you still are just a regular person and you will continue to do those stories that you find fascinating and in need of illumination. Yeah. These all these stories, whether it's your story and you, you went to North Korea, your riches, fuck, you didn't have to go there. You did that because this was compelling and this was also something that you felt like needed to be illuminated, but you also have to look at you and, and, and say, okay, you know, where's, where's everyone else doing that? Whereas Brad Pitt or what he's doing, his own thing, I mean Brad Pitt is, he adopts a lot of calories, but who's actually paying money out of their own pocket to create a studio to have dialogue.

Speaker 3:          02:30:50       And by the way, I will say this, the only thing that really fucking matters in this world is dialogue. We have to talk about shit. And if we stopped talking about shit, we're dead. And you know, you might not agree with me, you might agree with me, whatever, but at least we can come here. We can talk about shit. But you know, if you can't talk about shit or the way you're talking, this is what's really important and this is what's really resonating with people that are listening to this podcast or watching it. We're talking in a way,

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       I mean, I joked around about Anderson Cooper. He's seems like a nice guy. He's gay. He's probably been fucked with his whole life. He's probably fine. I bet if you sit down with them, he's fine. I bet a good percentage of the shield he puts up is just to try to keep his job as a gay albino and a fucking white man's world. You know what I mean? But the reality is that guy can't do this. Well if Shane, if Shane Smith wants to go out and have his own podcast and you do it in a sumo diaper, one of those crazy sumo diapers and you have all these Thai lady boys around you and you're drinking fucking drinks with umbrellas in it and your, your, your smoking big spliffs but you're still talking about the world and important points, people will still listen. You know why? Because you're being what is absolutely 100% lacking in all of corporate controlled media and that is authentic. Well, what's missing?

Speaker 2:          02:32:13       I will say this, I don't know Anderson Cooper and I don't know most of these lives in our firehouse, but, but what I will say is, and this is a big deal for me anyways personally, is we were in negotiations with Time Warner and we were in negotiation and a lot of people and uh, you know, I could have made a lot of money. They want an Anderson Cooper and you'd go on a cruise. That would be no problem. I'll go on a cruise with anyone know what w like what are the thing is everyone wants control. Right? And I fought very hard to keep control. I don't even know why. Quite frankly that's, that's beyond because this is, it goes back to the one day you wake up and say, I got the money. I won the game. What the fuck am I doing? Why am I fighting so hard for control?

Speaker 2:          02:32:59       I vote 95% of the board and largest single shareholder advice. Why did I do that? Why didn't I take money off the board and spend it? I'm not, by the way, I'm not setting myself up. I don't know the answer to that question, but at least for now I run fucking vice now. I don't run it perfectly because a lot of shit gets through that shouldn't get through and a lot of things happen that shouldn't happen cause I don't have enough time in the day and there's a bottleneck and I have to get better at that. But the thing is is I was able to launch vice news by myself. I was able to launch a vice. He was, we're up for Peabody's and poachers. I just wanted to the Knight Foundation Award for Journalism, which is great and I never had heard of that shit. Well I was trying to start a party.

Speaker 2:          02:33:47       I was trying to talk to a girl, but she was like, yeah, I just won that night ward for Knight Foundation, Cock suckers. In any case, what I'm trying to be, I'm trying to do a humble brag, but what I'm trying to say is, what I'm trying to say is I could do that. I could say, you know what? I'm going to override my board. I'm going to override everybody going override my investors and I'm going to invest in news when everyone says you shouldn't because there's no money to be made news. Which is true, but guess what? We did it. Why? Because it's fucking important. You're a guy. You don't have to do any of this shit. You're in fucking Hollywood. You're celebrated motherfucker. You can come out here and you can not do fucking anything and fucking kill it. Now what I'd like to say is you got to medium old guys here who like a fucking few drinks and by the way were regular dudes who just grew up and said, hey, I watch Scooby doo when I was young and then I did this and I did that and now we're just sitting here that said, I believe that we're in the majority.

Speaker 2:          02:34:42       I believe that us and people like us are in the majority. And then we look and shit now and say, hold on a second, all these old motherfuckers are dying off. We control this country. Now, not only this country, but probably, you know, the West, you know, with our money and with our politics, why are we still doing all this shitty stuff? The only guy that does it, we can weak out and says, why are we still doing the shitty stuff is fucking Joe Rogan. Now Anderson Cooper, what he does is sits there and says, here's the storm here, or whatever there.

Speaker 3:          02:35:13       So sort of weatherman. He's a weatherman. So for me, by the way, I'll tell you what I'll tell you right now, Fox, CNN up the ass and fuck all mainstream media. Fuck Fox News up the ass. But what I will say is we'll at least try, I'm not going to just say fuck CNN and not try to be better than them. I believe in the first eight months of vice that we were better than CNN. We're up for all the awards, right? We are rating better than CNN. And by the way, we're not doing it great. We're not perfect. We're not fucking doing a great, but we're going to get there now, certainly, you know, you know we fucking broke Ebola. We broke all isis. We were the first in Ukraine. We were the Fox first and guys, but guess who the fucking people. I'm going to go talk about that.

Speaker 3:          02:36:01       What does you fuck CNN and fuck 60 minutes that they had their time. So rude. I can't be a part of this because I was about to do a deal with Larry King to relaunch Larry King lives fine, but he's gone. He's, he's going to do his own thing. That's why I'm on the Internet now. He should do his own thing an mean. It's probably should do their own thing. But if we found that they get more, he gets more views using the internet than he ever did, but he will though. He will probably, he will. Of course he was. We just got somebody behind them with some shackles. Give them some growth hormones. I would, I would back him except for the fact that he's fucking oldest. [inaudible] we're all going to be fucking old. Well, I'm not going to be a holding. He was old and he was Timothy leary. You'd back them. I don't know. I'm not an old gangster. Yeah. You think so? Yeah. Don't you think that somewhere along the line science will save you. Science will step in and just shut the liver. Regeneration. Peggy, give Shane a shot and lose their breast. I'd either liver cancer, peace

Speaker 2:          02:37:02       and I was like, I will literally give you all my money if you can fucking care my liver cancer because excuse me. And I know it's in the mail cause I like to drink booze and I gotta tell you I like to drink booze or it food. I like to sleep. I'm essential.

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       Sensualist you like senses? I like sensual. I think. Yeah. Who doesn't? I want to find that fine. Have you ever been an experience? I want to find that guy wants be known. Ah, Robin and cane on his dick all day. Who is he? That guy. You only live once and then you're dead for a long time. That's what I'm saying, Dawg. Fuck all those people that disagree. Sensory experiences. One of the beautiful things about life, the greatest thing about life is life. Enjoy your fucking shit no matter what it is. And then you're going to be dead for a long time. So just do it. The more the older I get, the more I'm just like, I'm going to enjoy the shit out of this motherfucker. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. The older I get, the of the mortality this is, that's set this God damn thing on fire and go.

Speaker 3:          02:38:03       When I was 20, I didn't think it was going to end when I was 30. I was like, this shit's going to end way in the future when I'm 40. I'm like, Hey, when does this end now I'm 47. I'm like, um, how much time do I have left? Those, those are the, the, the steps, the mortality of the 20s is staggering to me now because I used to, I used to just think it's all going to go on for it. Well, I have a buddy and uh, he, he called me once and he goes, you know, what's the scariest fucking thing in the world? Teenage boys. Oh fuck. Yeah. And I go, why? He goes, well, I was the scariest. Yeah. He goes, they don't know. They don't know. They can, they want to make a name and they want to fuck shit up and smash shit.

Speaker 3:          02:38:41       Yeah. And it's true and I think that that's one of the weird things about life is that no one comes out of the box with any sort of understanding of what the, the grand spectrum of this experience is. The scariest thing in life is teenage boys done. Cause they don't give a fuck. I was a teenage boy and I would fuck the shit up. And every time, I mean, if you, doesn't matter if you're in Africa, Afghanistan, whatever, if you see a bunch of teenage kids with guns, you're fucked. If you see a guy with a gray beard, you're like, I can talk to this guy. Talk to this guy. Yeah, no, you, he's right. That's the scariest thing in life is teenage. Well, intro

Speaker 1:          02:39:22       in, in understanding of that or in, in consideration of that, the scariest thing in life is really ignorance is power and ignorance together. And when you're 18 and where you and you're a young man, your idea of what you you can accomplish once you start getting laid. Once you win your first fistfight, once you, you know, you're at the top of the world, it's like you, you, you get into this experience in life where, because of the limited amount of information that you've been exposed to, the limited amount of people that you've met, the limited amount of friends that you've had, you start, you start forming your world and your world is so small. It's so tiny. But you think because of the limited amount of experience that you have, you think that this is what's up. We'd live living in New York too. Long time. They're all fucked. Fake eyelash surely can't talk as Joe Rogan smokes, the strongest bond left, but you're right. Speed we represent. I think that the,

Speaker 2:          02:40:27       you were exactly right in that when I was young, I would tell you, I knew what the fuck I was talking about. I would tell you I understood mortality. I would tell you all this shit, but the fact of the matter is, no matter how bad the fight or how drunk I was driving my car home or jumping off the bridge into the water or all the stupid shit I did when I was young, in the back of my mind, I believed that I would never die. And even because I hung out with this gang of kids and a bunch of them died from drug overdoses and a bunch of them die from car accidents and he says, said, shit, there's nothing sadder than a teenager die. But the thing is is quite frankly, they all died from the boring shit. They all died from you got wasted and you fucking hit the car.

Speaker 2:          02:41:20       You got fucking wasted to use overdose or whatever the fuck it is. And you look at it now and go, you know how much you missed, man, you know how much of all this crazy fucking shit you didn't get to see. You know? And at that point you're like, look, I was the dumbest mother fucker on earth when I left home at 14 and I got progressively dumber until I was probably in my mid twenties and I think when mortality comes and gets you, and this is, I dunno about you, but it's hit me, is every day is fucking awesome. You know, I, I see the worst shit in the world everyday with politics and with poverty and with the environment, whatever the fuck it is. But guess what? Fucking life.

Speaker 1:          02:42:08       This is fucking awesome. If you're healthy, life is amazing. If you're a healthy life is, you're healthy, if you're healthy and you have friends, that's the big one. That's why solitary confinement is the darkest shit of all time.

Speaker 2:          02:42:20       Hold on. And this goes back to our first point. If you're out to be healthy, you're right, you got to, you know, have friends, family, somebody's out there. You know, you got to enjoy your shit. You know, enjoy your food, enjoy your fucking sleep and joy, your book, whatever the fuck it is. But the other thing is, is if you don't have future, if you don't have like I tomorrow's going to be good too. You know, then you're fucked. And that's why we all have to participate in that shit. Sorry I

Speaker 1:          02:42:49       caught you off guard. It's inevitable. I mean we're, we're all participating because it's inevitable. I mean we're, we're all a part of this crazy growing wave.

Speaker 2:          02:42:58       Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:42:59       I'm going to have become addicted to your, it's good for you, dude. Don't be scared it a life. It's going to just calm me down and soothe you and relax your soul.

Speaker 2:          02:43:10       But if had, if I had you all over again, I would realize that every day is fucking just, I think you will have to kill it.

Speaker 1:          02:43:17       I think if you had to do it all over again, you do it exactly the same because if you didn't, you would never learn the lessons that you learned. You know? I mean, I'm not claiming that I've gone the perfect path, but I, I, every fucking disaster I've ever been a part of, every mistake I've ever made. It's made me humble, reconsider, or be more considerate, be more introspective, be more observant, be more objective. It's just look at it from, you have to fuck up. You can't, everybody that fucks up, they feel like they're a bad person cause they fucked up. But no, you're just a person. Hopefully you didn't fuck up too bad.

Speaker 2:          02:43:54       That's how you learn by fucking up. Yeah. It's a bit when it, when, when you're killing it, you're like, Oh yeah, I'm smart in some of the best. Exactly what you learn by fucking up. That's what people hate, right? What do we, what do we hate more than anything? We hate cockiness, right? Yeah. It's one of those. But yeah, people hate more than anything, which is yes, it's true. And I've learned that the hard way because I like being cocky. I like guys, I like saying I'm going to fucking kill it. And I'm like, other guys, I like beat guys go and say, and they're going to come if they don't, that's coming. Whatever. That's bro. No, but I do, I like people being confident and going out there and doing that shit. It's Bible. Well, my old man always said to me when I was young, he goes, they're going to tell you life is fair.

Speaker 2:          02:44:37       That's not true. He goes, life is brutal. You have to be the smartest and the toughest and you have to win and you have to be there in the right place at the right time. Even then if you have a little Dick, you're fucked. Well, cause I have a huge dick you that didn't come into it. But no, he, it was just like he was, he was, he was like honest because that's the truth. It's fucking hard. Yeah, it's hard. And you have to have a little bit of luck as well. And everyone off tells their kids, it's fine, it's good, it's gonna be great. And my old man was like anxious going to be fucking hard. So you better really fucking tried to hit it because if you get fucked up, it's only going to travel with you. And at that point you're, you sit there and go, honesty goes a long way. We're are wasted. We should probably go. And I got to get them

Speaker 1:          02:45:28       best ending of a podcast ever a long drunk and rent. And we should probably get

Speaker 2:          02:45:34       out of here because it's only gonna get worse from now on for me.

Speaker 1:          02:45:39       Shane's bad mother fucker. You, every time we talk, I feel inspired. You're a bad mother fucker, dude. The next time we were, we have a rule, a new rule. Next podcast. It be no complimenting each other, either one at all. Done. I love you, but it's enough. Enough already. We're getting ridiculous. Uh, you're, you're the best man. I appreciate you very much. Appreciate you very much. I appreciate you coming out to. Thank you. All right fuckers. We'll be right back in about 10 minutes with the Great Ari Shaffir bull pin it.

Speaker 2:          02:46:09       I got an RS holder on that.
