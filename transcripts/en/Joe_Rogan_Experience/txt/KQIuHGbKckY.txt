Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Johnson, what's happening buddy? Joe Rogan, thanks for coming to border. Appreciate it man. Other way around. You're on the short list of people that folks consider a rational person that's running for president. We're in a very strange time. Would you agree? I think we're in the strangest time, Evers, um, maybe in the history of politics, certainly in my lifetime. Yeah. It doesn't seem to make a lot of, it almost seems like this is the last gasp of the idea of running for president. You know, when you just do the mathematics of a, the fact that, uh, Hillary and Donald Trump are arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today, that trump has to go out and get 30% of the far right to get the nomination. Hillary has to go out and get 30% of the far left when 50% of my of Americans right now who are registering to vote are independent at the end of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Don't. The two major parties represent about 30% of the electorate. And so where is, um, where the interests is the representation for the majority of interest in America? I think it's the libertarian party. I think it's libertarian. Um, people just don't know it. And speaking with a broad brushstroke, libertarian, fiscally conservative, socially liberal. Yeah. That seems to be where most people hang their hat. But it's not something that most people identify with when they talk about their actual political persuasion. They usually say there on the left or right there on the right when you, someone says they're a libertarian. That's that dude at the office. It has guns, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'm sorry. The what? The dude at the office, the crazy dude at the office, you know. Well, so we hit this, we w w we hit the streets the other day in New York, a film crew and asked 40 people what a libertarian was and it was zero.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       No one knew. No one knew. So I, you know, I, I'm, I'm with you. I understand the crazy guy with the guns, but for the most part, libertarian is just undefined. No, nobody knows. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a libertarian. I'm just saying when you think about libertarian, it's the guy who is fed up and is like sort of on the fringes. That seems to be with a lot of people associate with being a libertarian. I would, and I carry that a little bit further and say that the baggage that the Libertarians Carrie is survival of the fittest. You know, the notion that you're about no government whatsoever, people are going to die in the streets. [inaudible] yeah, no governor. Well that's the wrap. Yeah, that is a wrap. And it's almost like everyone knows that the two party system is kind of stupid, but everyone seems to think that any other party other than the two party system is unrealistic or any other party, like a Libertarian Green party somewhere along anything independent is unrealistic. Well, um, I'm back to right now 50% of all people that are registering to vote or are registering

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       as independent. Statistically right now, 43% of America is independent but new registrations, 50%. So I don't, uh, I don't know as the, as people do identify with the two parties, the rigged game of the system is, is that we're only presented with two choices. And that really starts with just being in the polls. Look right now, if Mickey Mouse, where the third name in any poll, Mickey would be pulling it 30%, but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50 states. And if I'm the libertarian nominee and I hope to be the libertarian nominee that happens next weekend, um, I'm going to be the only other candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. So polling, I, I just want to beat in the polls. There is no way a third party wins without being in the presidential debates. That's just not going to happen. The superbowl of politics to get in the presidential debates, you have to be at 15% in the polls, Joe.

Speaker 2:          00:04:01       The rig game is, is that if you're not in the polls, there's no way that you can pull at 15%, but it has to be a consistent polling. Um, starting now. I was in the first national poll that I've been in a month ago. I haven't been in a national poll since, but in a month, a month ago, I was at 11% against Hillary and trump. And was this all established back when Ross Perot sort of shook up the political establishment because that there was a lower percentage required to get involved in debates before that? Actually, well actually there was no percentage points prior to Ross Perot. That was something that got established after Ross Perot. And what, what is amazing to me is Ross Perot after having gotten 19% of the general election vote the first time, the second time he ran, they did not allow him in the presidential debates, which is just, I mean that's the rigged nature of the game.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       The rig nature of the game is, is come this fall, if my name does not appear in another single pole, the presidential debate commission, we'll say a Gary Johnson. He just didn't pull high enough. What they've, what they won't say is that he wasn't in the polls and the Commission for presidents of the basis of privately funded institution, private Democrats and Republicans were suing the presidential debate commission. Also, we, we think that it's a antitrust, we think that, uh, not think it's Democrats and Republicans and they collude with one another to exclude everyone else. Bruce Fein is suing the presidential debate commission. Bruce finds claim to fame is that he brought Nixon down in Watergate. But in the next sentence, he will tell you that the biggest thing he's ever done in his life is suing the presidential debate commission because this has the opportunity of changing politics in America. I mean, this is really at the heart of this rig game. You can't

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       win the presidency if you're not in the super bowl of politics. We've, we figured the dollar value alone of being in the presidential debates is several hundred million dollars. Just think of the Super Bowl and the ads that sell during the super bowl. And imagine being a, having our second biggest audience. You don't have like 75 million people for, you know, 90 minutes, two hours. That's, that's a couple of hundred million dollars worth of advertising. Yeah. That is the show. And if you're not in the show, people don't consider your vote like it. They think of, even if you have 50% of these people that are registering and saying they're independent, what they're really saying is they're not committing to a left or a right. They're not committing to a democratic Republican, but are they gonna vote independent? That's a lot of people. They have this idea that if you vote independent, you're throwing away your vote.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       That's, that is a stigma that has to be overcome. Right? No, no, no, no. I, I agree. But, but for those people that they do vote, right, and they ended up voting on the basis of the lesser of two evils, but since they're registering to vote and they're registering to vote as independent, they end up at the polls. I mean, for the most part, most pick, most people don't even go to the polls. Most people don't even vote. Yeah. It's, is there a way to fix it? Do you think that there's a way to maybe somehow or another allow people to vote online and change the way it's set up? Now? We don't have to physically go to a location. You don't have to sign up physically in a place that you can actually just do it from your computer the same way we bank.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       That has to be the future. Um, that does not exist now. But that has to be the future. And from a legislative standpoint, meaning, okay, you're president of the United States or governor of New Mexico, you could sign legislation that, um, and, and these are the things that are going to happen. It's going to be easier and easier to vote. And that's what should be the case, which should be the case if the system isn't totally rick. Cause the problem is people like Hillary, um, the people that are long time established, when people that had been a part of politics forever, the last thing they want to do is turn over the reins to the Internet because she's had what, how much they send. They say they were spending spending over a million dollars just to combat online trolls just to go on reddit and forums and correct people. Yes, and I would, I would be surprised if the number was that low.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       I would be surprised too. Yeah. I think they're probably being pretty conservative about that, but the idea is that the internet doesn't like the establishment. They know that there's a real problem with the system, the system in place as is and the Internet. When I say the Internet of the broad stroke that you're painting is obviously young people who are a little bit more aware of how screwy this whole system that they're sort of born into is and that the people that are in charge don't want to change it. They want to keep it a two party system. They want to keep this silly white hat, black hat, goofy game going on forever and keep of the power

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       right on this. But this cycle for the first time in my lifetime, this might change. I mean this because of just how polarizing the two of them are. And I think Bernie Sanders is what a lot of people think of as the alternative right now. Mainstream alternative. And he stands pretty far out there from the other guys. So have you seen the website I side with.com you gotta write it down. You've got to take, take this political quiz I side and everybody listening take this political quiz. I side with the com, it's about 60 questions. It's really easy. You don't have to, you know, you, you don't have to sign up on the website, but you take this quiz and at the end of the quiz you get paired up with a presidential candidate most in line with your views. It just makes real sense. I think everybody should take the quiz and whoever you line up with, um, I think you should knock yourself out supporting that person.

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Well, for me, taking the I side with quiz, amazingly, the next politician that I aligned with outside of the libertarians that are running for president is Bernie Sanders. Um, I aligned with Bernie Sanders 73% of what he says. Now when it comes to economics, we come to a t in the road, uh, when it comes to the socialism versus, um, you know, being an entrepreneur when it comes to big government versus small government, we come to that t in the road. But, uh, on the issues of legalizing marijuana, same sex marriage, a woman's right to choose, hey, let's stop with these military interventions. This is just, this is just crazy. We're in line. So, um, I, I pushed this website because, um, it should work the other way around. Okay. I side with Bernie most of the time, but oh my gosh, the libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, I side with next in line and I do believe that, um, Bernie is not going to get the nomination.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       I don't think that's going to happen. And where do all those voters go? Where does 50% of Republicans go? That really are at the end of the day. And I was socially tolerant and fiscally conservative and I think that is the majority of Republican voters. But, uh, they've been co opted by the social conservatives that have an agenda that I think is really a turnoff to most of America. And it's okay to be a social conservative. There's nothing wrong with being a social conservative, but if you, if you equate or if you make that public policy, if you pass laws regarding social conservatism, you end up putting people in jail for personal choices. And we do have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. And I think that starts with the drug war. The word conservative is interesting too, when you apply it to social issues like social conservativism cause conservatives really wa the original conservatives were stay out of my business. I'll stay out of yours. So social conservative really wouldn't apply to like things along the of gay marriage

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       or same sex unions or anything along those lines. You would, you'd say we'll leave those people alone. That would be the conservative approach that government should stay out of those people's lives. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Well, it started out as classical liberal. Classical liberal is being fiscally conservative and socially liberal, which got co-opted. I mean that, that used to be what a conservative was and that got co opted. And, um, like I said, I think we're a little bit of both. You've heard the old adage that if in college you weren't a Democrat, you didn't have a heart. And if a, as an adult, you weren't a Republican, you didn't have a brain. Well, I think we've got both. All of us have got both of those things.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       Yeah. It's just real polarizing to have only two choices.

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       Well, and it's, and it's so polarizing because the, those issues, um, at the, at the end of the day, um, why can't Democrats and Republicans come together on some very common sense issues that would move the country before

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       ward? Well, decades ago, the term libertarian was very, very rarely used. When was it invented? And I think we would all agree that it's at least something discussed today.

Speaker 2:          00:13:04       So 71 is when the libertarian party was established. And I remember in [inaudible] 71 and, uh, I graduated from high school in [inaudible] 71 and I remember getting a book that said, here's what it is to be a libertarian. And it was a very short read, uh, read the book. And, uh, clearly I was a libertarian. I've identified myself as a libertarian since now have I registered as a libertarian? Um, no, but back to the book or read the book, it said pass the book on as I had had it passed on to me and for me, uh, I've identified myself as such since I think it's very typical that, um, well in New Mexico, I remember in the eighties, early eighties, there was a congressional debate, Republican, Democrat and the Libertarian and the discussion in the bar afterwards when something like this who won the debate, well, there's just this overall consensus was the libertarian won the debate, but who are we going to vote for? Because the libertarian never wins, right? Yeah, yeah. That's the real rub, right? The, throwing your vote away, throwing your vote away and how can you, uh, I mean, throwing your vote away is voting for somebody that you don't believe in. That's throwing your vote away. You vote for somebody you believe in and that's how you change the system.

Speaker 4:          00:14:25       Yeah. It's really become a stigma that has to somehow or another be removed publicly. And um, I just keep thinking that with each one of these fiasco elections, that this idea of a third party will slowly but surely emerge and it seems to be gaining ground

Speaker 2:          00:14:43       and it could be this cycle, but so far, no, I mean it hasn't had what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:14:48       Yeah, well it's the TV, it's the TV thing, man. I those

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       debates, they're so bizarre. It's such a strange show. Or one person says something and the other person standing there shaking their head and not agreeing and then they enter jacked or they go over their time and the other person jumps in. It's one of the worst ways ever to get your point across and, but it, I agree, but if you're not in those debates, you, you were a non entity. You have no chance. I mean that's a, that's a, you know, a seal of approval if you will. It's a seal of credibility that you're on the stage in the first place. And if you're not on the stage, you don't have a chance. So a lot is riding on this Bruce Fein lawsuit, you believe? No, I'm actually, what everything is riding on for me is being in the polls. If I am in the national polls, I'm back to the Mickey analogy, but Mickey's not on the ballot in all 50 states.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       So the justification of having me in the polls is it then I am on the ballot in all 50 states. And I really do think that I represent the majority of Americans. I'm offering up proof of that with this ice side website. People say to me, why should I vote for you? Well, how about about getting online and seeing where you're, where you are at philosophically with those people running for president. I mean, don't you owe it to yourself to find out, um, who lines up with what it is that you believe in? That's a rational approach. It's a very rational approach and people owe it to themselves. It's just fascinating that we look, nobody really knew who Bernie Sanders was until this election. It wasn't something that was in the public eye. I mean, if you knew about him, he knew of him as a senator, but no one knew a lot about him until this cycle.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Yup. And then when you, when you go down the litany of his issues, like I say, I, I, I agree with the guy three quarters of what he has to say, but what I'm saying to the exit, to the point of a economics, that's, that's the real proof that this is a locked up system. Because if you were in those debates with all those people, and during the same time, most likely a lot of people would be looking at you and go, you know, this Gary Johnson guy makes a lot of sense. And what you point out is, is absolutely correct in that every single republican on stage was a social conservative. And when it comes to the Democrats, um, look, well both parties are well intentioned, but when it comes to Democrats, look, they do grow government. And I really believe that a bigger government, although it's well intentioned, at the end of the day, it takes tax money out of my pocket that I could be spending on my life as opposed to the government spending that money.

Speaker 3:          00:17:29       Ideally you'd, you know, you'd, you'd take your money and you'd be able to donate it to a, just exactly where, where you wanted that money to be spent ideally. And I realized that that's not practical at all, but that's a really good point that the fact that the larger the government gets, the more money it cost to keep that going. So the idea that it's going to do better, who's going to do more, there's more government is more people, there's more programs, but they cost more money and then then it just, it becomes a point of diminishing returns. And at the end of the day, statistically it doesn't help. Um, and, and that isn't to say, you know, I'm in the camp that believes that there are those people that are truly in need, but I think we've gone way over the line when it comes to people in need.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       And at the end of the day, if we continue the growth of government and taxation, uh, at the end and printing money, at the end of the day, we're going to suffer from horrible inflation at some point. This is my belief. Do we have a fighting chance against what, what is the worst, most insidious tax of all, which is inflation, which erodes the, you know, you're, you're buying capacity for the money that you earn. There's nothing worse than inflation, but that's what we're looking at if we don't actually just get some common sense a at the helm. Now when you say, um, those in need, like particularly or specifically what, what programs are, what's in place right now that you don't agree with? Don't agree with. Yes. I don't know. Is there's anything that I really don't agree with. It's just within the context of those programs, you have lines drawn for eligibility.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       Should there be cell phones? And I just use this as an example. Should those people on welfare have cell phones? While the argument is, is that uh, without a cell phone, you can't be connected to a job well, is it, does it really mean a job? And I, I point that out just as a, this was a line drawn that this is now a, um, uh, a benefit of being on welfare. A benefit of being on welfare is that you get a cell phone of benefit of welfare is, is that yeah, you get a cell phone. So there's an allotment or an allowance for cell phone usage or something like the federal government spends multi billions of dollars a year on cell phones for those on welfare. Hmm. No, I, I just point that out as, gee, is that really, is that really a function of government and a, wouldn't people be connected?

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       Uh, the notion that if you can work, you should work. The notion that if, let's say the government is giving you $100, these are very theoretical figures, but let's just say the government's giving them $100 a month and, and you can't work. If you work, you're going to lose the hundred dollars a month. What about the notion of if you work, the government will give you 75 bucks and you can make a hundred bucks. So at the end of the day you're working and you make $175. Um, it doesn't that make sense. Little less money from the government incentivizing you to actually go out and get a job. It is as simple as what I'm talking about having done the exact same thing in New Mexico. Um, the supreme court ruled that what I did administratively was unconstitutional and, and what did, what was the exact ruling? Like what did you do? Well, what we did is just exactly what I just now said is, okay, so the government is giving you $100 a month.

Speaker 3:          00:21:00       How about the notion that if few there that there's a requirement that if you can work, you will work. So now you can go out and make $100 without getting penalize. We, so you were, but without getting penalize, you make $100 and instead of the government paying use $100 a month, the government pays you $75 a month. At the end of the day you've got a job and now you're getting $175 and I'm making sense here. Yes. Yeah. So that's what we implemented. All the help wanted signs in the state went down because everybody had to go out and get a job. Now the legislature sued me immediately on the basis that what I was doing was unconstitutional, that what I was doing needed to be passed by the legislature, that it couldn't be an executive order. And after six weeks of implementing this program, uh, the Supreme Court in New Mexico ruled that what I had done was unconstitutional.

Speaker 3:          00:21:53       I'm not, I'm not here to debate that, but you know, we kind of proved that what I was saying was correct. They never did a back it up with legislation. They could have overridden the courts by just caudifying what we did in legislation. Uh, but they never did that. So what you're saying is what you did was effective, but they just ruled it unconstitutional and they never changed any of the rules. Exactly. Exactly. Is that frustrating for, you know, I mean it's a, you know, it's the three branches of government. I am very, I'm very reality based. Um, you know, this is, this is the power that the executive has, the power power of the executives. The executive gets to run government now within the bounds of a legislation. You know, it is three branches of government. And I, I respect that and I understand it.

Speaker 3:          00:22:44       Um, it's just, it is the nature of the beast, but you should, that shouldn't, that should never dissuade you as an executive from doing what you think is right. Uh, and, um, in many cases, like I say, that's where the court step in and that's where the legislature will step in. It should have been legislated. So if, if it was effective and it was proven to be effective. Yeah. Well w all the help wanted signs in the state went down for six weeks and then immediately on this ruling, all the help wanted, signs went back up. But I mean, realistically though with a real actual numbers of like unemployment being down and you could show it and bring it to them. Well, if you did, what was the argument against what you did well that, uh, that they did not that what I did needed to be legislated as opposed to executive action, but once it was proven to be effective, what would you would think that that would be? So I was a Republican governor in New Mexico, two to one democrat.

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       Uh, one of the big surprises I've had a having served as governors, I, oh, really naive Lee thought at the end of the day, Democrats and Republicans would come together over issues that were right, meaning do the right thing as opposed to lining up politically. So in this case, um, they lined up politically and um, and, and never pass the legislation that, and six weeks was not, I mean, I, I say anecdotally, all the help wanted, signs went down. They did go down, but really not enough time to garner the statistics that could have made that in fact a national program emulated by other states because we would have shown success doing it. Here's one for you, Joe. So, so welfare in New Mexico, um, I had a health insurance policy as governor of New Mexico. Okay. I mean, this is given to me. This is, this is a perk. Being governor, I have a health insurance policy covers me and my family is governor of New Mexico.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       We took all the welfare recipients in the state and uh, which were a quarter of a million and, um, 200,000 people. And did the math, gee, what if we gave all of them my health insurance policy as opposed to just paying the bills when it came to welfare? Get it. I mean, everybody on welfare would receive my insurance policy as governor of New Mexico. Would we really save 20%? Uh, yes, we did that. We did that. And that's what happened. And as comedy saved 20%. Yeah. And Save 20%. Um, and to this day that is still, that is still in place. That was moving from a fee for service. Meaning if you were on welfare and you went to the hospital or you went to the emergency room, uh, Bill was sent to the State Medicaid and the state paid that bill. Three quarters of that bill got picked up by the federal government and one quarter of it gets picked up by the state, but that's a medicaid. Um, and by switching to a, an insurance model or a managed care model, um, we save 20% on the whole bill. I mean, it's just common sense, uh, to the Max. I mean just really flabbergasting

Speaker 5:          00:26:12       now when you look at things like obamacare and the criticism of obamacare and you look at what you were trying to implement in your own state, wha what do you think could have been done differently?

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       Well, um, I think that a welfare, uh, and uh, medicare, so healthcare for those over 65, I think the federal government needs to devolve both of these services to the states. Now, currently of course, um, healthcare for those over 65 is completely federal. But in my heart of hearts, if the government would have

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       blocked granted, New Mexico, a fixed amount of money, uh, just kept, by the way, this is just runaway expenditure. This is the worst runaway expenditures in federal government today is Medicaid and Medicare. But if they would have just kept it or the historical increased being 7%, if they'd had just given a couple of percent increase to the state of New Mexico as opposed to let's say 7% and said New Mexico, Governor Johnson, you are in charge of healthcare delivery to those that are poor, uh, welfare and those, uh, health care to those that are over 65 in my heart of hearts, I believe that I could have delivered that are seen over the administration of the delivery of that healthcare. So if you did, if the federal government did that, and that's the only way to reform Medicaid and Medicare is devolve it to the states, 50 laboratories of innovation, best practice, there would be some fabulous success that would get emulated.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       There'd be horrible failure that would get avoided. But as opposed to one size fits all the federal government, we'd actually, we'd actually come up with solutions on how to cap and, and how to, uh, main or contain the costs within, uh, within the system talking about Obama care. Um, what we really need when it comes to healthcare is just free market solutions to healthcare. And by in healthcare is as far removed from free market right now as it possibly can be in a free market system for healthcare, we would have, we would not have health insurance to cover ourselves for ongoing medical need. We would have health insurance to cover ourselves for catastrophic injury and illness. And we would pay as you go in his system, that would probably cost about one fifth of what it currently costs. We would have gallbladders are us, we'd have gallbladder surgery for thousands of dollars as opposed to tens of thousands of dollars. We'd have stitches are us, we'd have x-ray's Aros, we'd have the radiologist's, next two s x rays are us to read those x-rays. Um, and at the end of the day we would pay out of pocket for those services and they would be a fifth of what they currently are.

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       So in a sense, what you're saying is that right now the medical health care is kind of being subsidized by the government? Well right now it's almost like an unrealistic amount of money is being spent on it. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       Well, right now health insurance would be like having grocery and insurance. Hey, you got grocery insurance, a I go to the, uh, I go to the supermarket and there's no prices on any of the shelves cause I got grocery insurance. It doesn't matter what anything costs. Am I going to buy a hamburger? Well, why you, why should I buy hamburger when I have grocery insurance and I can buy a, right.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       But in the one of that logic, like what does anyone doing differently because they have health insurance. It's not like they're getting extra treatments. Well, so in the, well right now, um, chief justice Roberts when he said that, um, that uh, obamacare was attacks on people. My personal insurance premiums have quadrupled and I have not been to see a doctor in three years. I mean, I, so it's a tax for me. I'm subsidizing those that aren't healthy. Um, I wish I didn't have to have insurance to cover myself for ongoing medical need. Look, we go into the hospital right now. There's no advertised pricing. You have no idea what you're going to pay. There is no statistics on, on the wall that say, Hey, if you're here for gallbladder surgery, you can expect a 99% outcome. There's none of that. If you had a free market approach to healthcare, you would have all of that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       You'd have advertised pricing and you would have a, um, outcomes based on, on, uh, on prior, uh, patients that had gone in. But there is an issue with people that do have injuries, whether it's a catastrophic injury, whether it's some sort of a disease that comes up where the amount of money that they're going to have to spend for healthcare can be catastrophic and astronomical. And that's, I started out by saying we would not have insurance to cover ourselves for ongoing need, but we would have insurance to cover ourselves for catastrophic injury and illness. But how do you define what's catastrophic and what's not? Like if you get cancer and dollar amount, dollar amount. Yeah. What about the health consequences of avoiding or not avoiding treatment? Because there's going to be a lot of people that don't have the money and are going to just deal with certain issues like a surgery perhaps that you need and you're just going to avoid it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       Knee surgery, things along those lines, like I said, considered catastrophic. Well, yes, absolutely. Beyond a certain dollar amount. I mean these, these are the things that you could choose in a, in a genuine free market approach to health care. What about like a meniscus scope, like a meniscus scope? Meniscus tears can be incredibly painful if you, you know, get scoped a few thousand dollars, would that be considered catastrophic? It's not really catastrophic engine. Well today it's a few thousand dollars because it's one of those no advertise pricing for meniscus tear. And having had several meniscus tears myself, uh, if you had a free market approach to healthcare, you would have meniscus. Tears are us, we specialize in meniscus tears, here are our outcomes. And uh, you can come in and get a meniscus tear surgery for what would end up to be hundreds of dollars as opposed to thousands of. So sort of like the way they do like lasik eye surgery today. Great example. Advertise pricing, cosmetic surgery, uh, you know, dentistry now, I mean you're starting to see advertised pricing and as opposed to the hundred dollar ass than that, when you go into the hospital, when you read the fine print, but of course you're not paying for it so you don't care. So in that sense, you would essentially go to a hospital, they would diagnose

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       you, they would tell you, here's the issue. You have to get a gallbladder and then you'd go to gallbladders are us.

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       Well or just from the very beginning, right? What's wrong? What's wrong with me? I mean you, you'd man with the Internet today and there could be so much innovation. Why, why do we even, and I'm, I am talking about a utopia, if you will, and I don't want to say utopia. This is very doable. This is something that a government could really lay the groundwork for a, but that it's like I say, as far removed from what I'm talking about,

Speaker 4:          00:33:13       fiscally conservative. When you say fiscally conservative, when you talk about issues like welfare and things along those lines, people get a sense, a lot of people do, um, that you are perhaps callous or uncaring about poor people. That that's the route. I'm not saying

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       no, no, no, but that is, but in our own lives, look its best pr in our own lives as best product. It's best service at the lowest price. That's, that's how we, that's how we analyze things. We don't give away our own money. Why? Why should government be giving? Why shouldn't government have the same credo?

Speaker 4:          00:33:47       Well, what I was going to get at was what you're saying as far as like the 50 states. That is probably one of the most interesting thing about having 50 states is that you can have 50 different experiments and you have 50 different, and we're seeing that of course with legalized marijuana in Colorado bringing in more tax revenue than alcohol for the first time ever. I mean this is a huge thing that's happening right now in Colorado and experiment in government. And the federal government tried to block it at one point and they were very concerned with it, but now they're letting it go and it's proving to be incredibly financially beneficial to that state. Now you're seeing Seattle or Washington state, Washington, DC, other states are starting to join in and it's going probably go nationwide within the next decade or so. Yeah. This is a perfect example, right, of states coming up with an experiment, the experiment proven to be fiscally effective and then moving forward with it

Speaker 3:          00:34:43       and Colorado probably have, has done the best job when it comes to the recreational states. Washington state has done the worst job. Uh, meaning that the taxes are so high in Washington state, uh, that the black market is alive and well. How hard is the taxes in Washington state to Colorado's 39% in Washington state? Well, a Washington state, they'll have an whatever the rate is though it applies four times. It, it applies to growing, it applies to processing. It applies to every single. So that at one point, two summers ago, right after Washington state implemented it and that a pot went on sale at one point, marijuana in, uh, in Washington state was selling for 26 grand a pound. What? $65 a gram. That's insane. Well, for

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       what you had, you had people lined up around, not around the block. People who'd never used marijuana before. Well everybody that had been using marijuana continued to get it on the black market because that was and is insane. Well, and these are the regulations as far as personal growing. Yeah. In some states. But, uh, to me that's also a common sense. I'm, I'm caveat to this legislation is they need to allow for home grow this the same way you get your groceries. I mean, it really should be no different if you want to grow your own tomatoes. Exactly. And grow your own standards. And, and I've always said that this, you know, we always talk about, or everybody is talking about the tax revenue, which is, which is correct. It's significant, but more significant than the tax revenue is the savings in law enforcement. The courts.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       And the prisons. We have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world and the reason behind that is that the war on drugs, we've got tens of millions of convicted felons in this country that, but for our dog drug laws would otherwise be tax paying law abiding citizens and the drug war. That is a, that's a huge factor. That's a huge factor in distrust and law enforcement. It's a huge factor in frustration with the system feeling disenfranchised with the the very system that's supposed to be governing us. You just feel like it's your enemy. Black lives matter. At the heart of that is the drug war. That's the heart of that. At the heart of the militarization of our police forces is breaking down doors in the name of confiscating drugs and a lot of that has been recently revealed with started off during the Nixon administration as just trying to control the civil rights movement and trying to control the antiwar movement the way they did it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       They recognize that these people using marijuana, let's go after them. Let's make it a big deal. Well, one of those political boogeyman that a as a politician elect me and I will save you from the ills of marijuana right now. Another one of those political boogeyman is immigration and it's a political boogeyman look. Immigration is really a good thing. They're not taking jobs that US citizens want and it's not an issue of lower pay unless it's an issue of language and they're the first ones that recognize that. And building a wall across the border is just crazy. What can be done at this point? Like if someone became a president, what could be done to stop this influx of private prisons, this, this prison industrial complex that we were finding ourselves in this horrible quagmire with? Well, so don't, don't mistake. Look, it's not just private prisons.

Speaker 1:          00:38:19       It's public prisons. That number one opposition to legalizing pot in California was the public prison union. So yeah. You know it's guards union, correct? Yes. It's keep jobs. They want to keep jobs. We've got 2.3 million people bars. Um, that's terrifying. That's terrifying. That guards would want to keep jobs so that they would want more people locked up for things that no one agrees with. That's really scary. I'll, I'll just, I'll just say it's a bad rap for private prisons as opposed to just prisons, period. There's a, there's a big, I said, as governor of New Mexico, um, and I privatized half the state prisons in New Mexico, apples to apples, oranges to oranges. The private prisons offered up the same goods and services for two thirds. The price and all that because they're not the government because they can do it for less money, just like every aspect of life.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       Private to can do it better than public. Every aspect of life isn't the issue though with something like a private prison. So this is a private corporation that profits from incarcerating people, amazing that they, that they can even profit and offer. So in New Mexico, if I may, when I took office, there were 800 prisoners housed out of state. There had been massive prison riots in New Mexico so that the federal courts were in charge of the prisons in New Mexico is called the Duran consent decree. The legislature refused to appropriate money to build new prisons. It was a huge problem that we had. So the private prison camp, private prisons, Wac, and Hud in particular came in and said, and the federal courts were running the prisons in New Mexico. So if what I'm about to tell you, if you think that we were going to get away with any less goods or services being delivered to the prison industry guests, again, federal courts are running the prisons in New Mexico on an apples to apples, oranges to oranges basis.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       Instead of 100 bucks a day, they offered it up for 66 bucks a day, two thirds, the cost. If that isn't good government, I don't know what is. And in New Mexico I constantly said if we would adopt rational drug laws, if we could let people out of prison, it will be a lot easier to empty the private prisons than it will be the public prisons. Well, excuse my ignorance on this, I'm not sure if I'm right, but I would imagine that something like a private prison, which is a company and it's a company that companies 10 to aspire towards growth, and when you have a private prison that profits off of people being in jail, you would attend to think that they would try to maximize their potential for growth or versus the government, right? It's logical. But May, maybe the component in here that you're missing is, is as opposed to growth. Just think of it as, as stepping in and taking over the services that are currently being provided for a lot less money, meaning taking over all the prisons and that would be their growth. So all presents. Exactly. And, and assuming, and this is, this is my experience now, and don't get me wrong. I mean there's, it's, there's just logic

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       behind, gee, if you're a private prison, then you're in it for the money. Right? That's logical. But it's, in my experience, it's completely removed from the reality.

Speaker 5:          00:41:46       But just in your experience in New Mexico, in New Mexico, fairly small state, well not small, but it doesn't have a large population.

Speaker 3:          00:41:53       Right. And, and excuse me, have there been, um, you know, a private prisons that lobby for more prisoners? I'm not going to say that that hasn't happened. Didn't happen. Did Not happen in New Mexico, but just don't discount that, that's not happening on the public side also

Speaker 5:          00:42:16       of course. Right, exactly what you're talking about with the unions, the guard unions, they are trying to somehow another maximize their potential and maximize their growth

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       and this mandatory sentencing, which really starts, uh, with the drug laws that we have. I mean, this is the reason why we have this high incarceration rate. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:42:34       That we have. How is it legal that these prison unions actually do that? Well, what's that squeak? Is that you? Yes, it is. Let's try to figure out what it was. Yeah, no legal though. That, how is it legal? Guardians can try to change laws and which where it's so transparent. It's not like they're trying to lock bad people up because they're really concerned about the safety of the public. They're worried about their jobs. So they want to incarcerate people that may or may not be incarcerated without their, their input. Joe,

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       you, you nailed it. Just extend that to other things that we see also. For example, you see ads on television that say, um, increase the expenditures for education that's being paid for from a tax dollars, from mud, from teachers, right? That will advertise for that. We see advertisements all the time from public institutions that in essence we're paying for, for increased funding all the time. Every time we turn around. How is that fair? How is that legal? Isn't that a manipulation of our brains? Uh, you know, in a, in a way that, uh, many times just belies the underlying logic that no, they shouldn't get more money, they should get more efficient.

Speaker 5:          00:43:56       Well, the issue though is this is very different because you're talking about people lobbying to try to lock up other human beings for their own profit. Well, um, like I say, your logical, what you're saying is logical. It's, it's got a perfect logic, kind of it's evil. I mean, if you really think about it, if they, if there's a brewpub, people of the massive amount of the general public doesn't believe that people should be in jail for a lot of the drug crimes are in jail for, especially marijuana. If you look at the statistics, you look at the amount of money that's being spent on it. Most people would say, this is fucking crazy. We've got to stop this. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       I'd say I've been more vocal about this than anybody in an elected office.

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       So when prison unions lobby contrary to

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       prison unions, yeah, prison unions, now you're public or either side of it, lobbies

Speaker 4:          00:44:47       four, four, four more lock. Contrary to public opinion, there should be an investigation and it should be criminal. I mean, what you're doing is you're lobbying to try to go against the, the wishes of the general public to put people in jail, and there's only one reason it's to maximize profit. You're not talking about any threat to the public. You're not talking about any healthcare threat. You're not talking about any tax burden from people out there smoking marijuana was selling marijuana. What you're talking about is maximizing your profit as a guard. That should be illegal

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       spot on. Uh, I would just ask everybody listening to just apply that same argument to a whole lot of other things that we're exposed to when it comes to.

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       So let's talk about if you, if you apply that same argument to education, what is it, what's your take on that?

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       Well fit back to 50 laboratories of innovation and best practice. The federal government should not be involved in education at all. And very quickly, federal government gives each state 11 cents out of every school dollar that every state spends, but it comes with 15 cents where the strings attached. The federal government says, here, we're going to give you 11 cents and you have to do a, b, c, and d to get the 11 cents. What are those? What are those steps they have to do? Well, one of those steps is now providing transgender bathrooms. Um, as the Obama administration has now stated, if you don't, if you, if you, well this is, this is reality. Now if you, if you don't provide these bathrooms, you're not going to get your 11 cents. So do they have to have a third bathroom? Was that the, it was that this well make, make accommodation.

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       Now this perfect example is they say that you have to do a, b, c and d, Use the transgender bathroom as the, as the latest and greatest front page. Here's what the federal government is requiring, but it costs you as a state 15 cents to deliver on getting the 11 cents. It actually is a negative to take federal money. So abolishing the Federal Department of Education, which I think people think was established under George Washington when it was established under Jimmy Carter. Um, tell me what really has been value added when it comes to the Federal Department of Education since, uh, since the 80s. And so when it was him,

Speaker 4:          00:47:06       well let's talk about that one step because it, is there any benefit at all to being open minded and trying to get people to discriminate against transgender people last, or is this some sort of a political hot topic that the government has latched on to try to get people to think that they're progressive and they're moving towards the right direction? Because I mean, how many people are we, well, it's the latter. It's, it, it's been

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       a nonissue. It's not been an issue our entire lives

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       for certain individuals in certain environments

Speaker 3:          00:47:37       and they've been accommodating themselves this whole time throughout, throughout our lifetimes. Um, there should be, I think there's absolute a heightened awareness. But, um, look, this is, this is overkill. This should, this should be an issue that, uh, Los Angeles deals with the state of California deal.

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       Correct me if I'm wrong, cause we were actually discussing this yesterday. I believe what North Carolina has said was that you have to use the bathroom that corresponds to the gender on your birth certificate. However, if Gary Johnson, you decide at 50, how old are you, sir? 63 63 if you decide at 63 years old, you want to be a woman that's a Bruce Jenner did, right? Yeah. If you decide you want to be a woman, you could change your birth certificate. Your birth certificate literally can be changed to say that you're a woman, then you can use the women's room. So that's all they're requiring. And so this up in arms is really like, they want it commitment, I think before you decide to go and use the women's room, like you literally have to just go and get your paperwork changed. Is that correct?

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       No, no. I no disagreement, but I'm, am I am a correct technically. Yeah. That's it. That is what they're requiring. Right. But when I think of of that bullshit, if you will, a over an issue that has never been an issue before. As governor of New Mexico Joe, I may have vetoed more legislation and the other 49 governors in the country combined. Where's this coming from? Where's it coming from? So if I, well, it's, it's, uh, it's discrimination against the lbgt community. That's the heart of all of it. As governor of North Carolina, if I had had been governor of North Carolina, I'd have vetoed that legislation. This is much to do about nothing. This is not an issue. Um, and certainly the federal government shouldn't be stepping in and doing this because North Carolina right now is suffering the wrath, if you will, or the whole country that says, we're going to boycott North Carolina. We're going to have nothing to do with North Carolina as a result of them having passed this legislation.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       But again, what they're saying in passing this legislation is not that complicated. They're just saying that you have to change your gender on your birth certificate. Right? I mean, it may be discriminatory at heart, but when you look at the actual paperwork, like what's required in order to use the women's room, like it's not saying that you have to have an x, y chromosome to use the men's room. They're saying you have to identify as a male on your birth certificate. So if a woman decides to become a man of transition to a man, she decided she's a man at heart and she changes that under birth certificate. They don't do a chromosomal test on her. So it's just a matter of a paperwork change. I'm not, I'm not really sure how much less you could require of someone to use a different bathroom that corresponds to the gender of their birth.

Speaker 3:          00:50:21       Well, I would just, I would just disagree that the government taken a role here that I agree we never had to be established. Right.

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       I agree with that. But if you do want to discourage discriminate against discrimination against transgender people, how would you go about encouraging that? Or is that just a social issue, social issue that needs to be worked out with people?

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       Well, it's a, it's an issue that needs to be worked out, uh, municipality state wide. But, uh, at the end of the day, um, this issue has existed our entire lifetimes. And have there been any reported incidents of anything anywhere? I'm not aware of any incidents any,

Speaker 4:          00:51:00       well, I'm sure there's been something and I'm sure some people feel maligned, but, uh, I just don't know if necessarily there's enough demand to require a law change and what all this Hullabaloo is about, about this law change. When I discuss it with people and I'm, I try to be as open minded as humanly possible when it comes to people's choices and what they want to do, whether it's regarding gender or sex or whatever you want to do. Me Too. I'm just, I'm, I'm fine with it, but my, my issue with this is I feel like it's a chance for people to jump up and say that they're outraged. I think it's almost like a recreational outreach thing. Like when I heard that Bruce springsteen was boycotting North Carolina, all these people jumping up and like, is that really the way to go about this?

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       Yeah, I think so. I mean that is the way to go about it.

Speaker 4:          00:51:46       Just stop. So you're saying it in terms of like government's gotten too big, you want to stop this law?

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       Yeah. The way to go about is to boycott. The still way to go about it is boy cat. The stage, just like a happened in Arizona when Jan brewer started to talk about vilifying Mexican immigration and uh, and conventions and the whole country was boycotting Arizona. And when it came to, um, you know, traveling there, I mean, it happened right? And, and it, and because of that, uh, you know, the change took place. North Carolina, same thing.

Speaker 4:          00:52:18       So, so really what's unnecessary in your eyes? You're a small government guy. What's unnecessary? Is the government getting involved at all

Speaker 3:          00:52:25       at all, at all? In this case, and don't get me wrong, government has a fundamental role to protect us against individuals, groups, corporations, foreign governments that would do us harm. And, uh, I'm running for president of United States. Um, I'd like to think that a, at the end of the day, I'm going to, I'm going to sign on to anything that makes things better. Uh, transgender law in front of me as governor and the state of North Carolina or president of United States. You know, you make that analysis. Is this going to make things better or at the end of the day is it just going to add time and money to our lives and not really do anything to plays devil's advocate? Is there any benefit in having it in the news is any benefit? Absolutely. Right. So people, you'll

Speaker 4:          00:53:10       become more and more aware of it. I mean, I think whether or not you look at Caitlyn Jenner as a, a real issue in this country. I think what the issue is is that people were becoming more aware that there are folks out there that don't necessarily fit necessarily with our standard

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       idea of what gender is. They, they're, they're all over the place. There's people on the far right and the far left just like politically. Yup. Yup. And a, at the end of the day, aren't most of us absolutely tolerant of that? Most of us. Yeah. And then people start there. The real issue, right? Yeah. The people that are intolerant of other people's choices that don't affect you at all. And the intolerant folks are the ones that are passing this legislation. Okay. So the intolerant ones, the ones who are saying enough is enough with all this transgender nonsense. You can't use the women's room if you're a man much to do about and nothing but the seed. There's some men, it's, it's, it's so, it's so confusing in some ways because they were as outliers on both sides. Like I have met transgender women who without a doubt, I would consider them a woman.

Speaker 5:          00:54:11       I mean, it looks like a woman. She talks like a woman has sensibility is like a woman dresses like a woman. Whatever the fuck that means. Right? But then on the other side, I've seen there's this guy that identified, we were talking about this guy recently identifies as a woman, has a beard, a has a penis, doesn't want to have a sex change, doesn't take hormones, identifies as a woman. Once it, we use the women's room and he's been doing it. No, no he hasn't. But he wants to. And it was one of the, it's an outlier. But you know, you're dealing with, there's all sorts of people when any issue like this comes up, right? And you're going to have rational, logical, obvious choices. And then you have like, what do you do with that guy choices

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       and where does that decision making best lie, that decision making best lies in the municipality, um, where that person lives. And if it's an issue, let's say an albuquerque and I'm the mayor of Albuquerque, um, welcome to come into the boys room. If you're welcome to come into the boys room, boys room can be labeled transgender and boy's room as far as I'm concerned.

Speaker 5:          00:55:12       Hmm. So the only worry there would be if they went into the boys room, they were discriminated against, but then show how many people going the males

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       boys room though. See, I think it'd be less of an issue. This, this is, this is knee jerk of course. And, and it's, and it's based on, uh, let's, let's have, instead of having a one size fits all, uh, how about let's work this out at the absolute lowest level. We can work it out and maybe we'll come to some real, you know, a monumental, uh, oh, you know, epiphany's on how to do this. What would possibly be the epiphany. I think that's one of the problems with this issue. Yeah. Okay. But, but um, you know, that's you and I thinking about this and if you had a municipalities thinking about it all across the country, some of them would come up with solution. You'd be some best practices that would emerge from this. That would make sense for everyone.

Speaker 5:          00:56:04       Well, the, the all the only suggested than I've ever heard. That makes any sense at all. Is it three bathroom rule like male, female, whatever. Well, but male, female and go for it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:14       Well, and imagine, um, imagine all schools in this country having to be ref retrofitted with that third bathroom. I'm talking billion.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       $100 billion. I'm just guessing. Well yeah, it's a lot of money. Let's just say a lot of money and the federal government's going to give you a 11 cents for you to accomplish their 15 cents where the mandate.

Speaker 5:          00:56:35       Yeah, it's, I liked the issue. You know why I liked the issue? Cause it's so bizarre and there's no answer. I love when something has no answer. When you just sit around going, man, I don't know. Right. Cause people will take sides and they'll run with their side and make sure that you think that their side is the only solution whatsoever when there really isn't an only solution. Profound. Yeah, it's, it's a weird one, right? You're back this weekend back to fiddle. Well it's, it's something to fiddle with. I mean, this is a fiddling sort of a conversation because it's, it's polarizing. It's confusing. And again, I'm not right. You're not right. There's no right on this. This is a weird thing. Look, the whole transgender thing is weird. It's very rare. I mean, you're talking about, is it even 1% of people that become transgender? I doubt it. It's probably far less than it's 0.03% of. So it's, yeah, it's, it's a very small amount of 3% of 1%. Very, very small amount. It varies. So a mandate, because

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       Hola kids, couple of kids out of thousands of students. That's kind of a cheesy way to look.

Speaker 5:          00:57:43       And wouldn't it be better for everyone if we just became more open minded and more friendly and loving and let people do whatever the fuck they want to do. Let, let the, the, the man who identifies as a woman, let them, you know, use the woman's room if he actually looks like a woman. But if you have a beard, maybe we should play aside and go, dude, you can use the men's room. Just your freaking people out.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       You probably spent as much time or more time than I have in Europe, but uh, you know what the showers are. Um, showers are men and women. It's men and women. Bathrooms. I don't shower in Europe and some gigantic prison, prison showers. You going to serve men and women showers. Yes. Open showers. These recreational facilities in virtually every single, uh, a mountain community in a, in the Alps for example, like skiing communities, like they have open showers. Well, in this case, you know, they've got, they've got the, they've got these marvelous, um, recreational facilities. It seems like in every town and in those towns, you know you've got a swimming pool and you got the showers and the showers are men and women both. Now as a person who has got, there's no choice. There's no choice. I'm back to Europe now. I mean this is a really different, it's just this kind of a thing is not an issue in Europe.

Speaker 3:          00:58:57       I'm going to imagine. Well, that would require a gigantic cultural shift though. We're very used to segregating male and female, but awareness. So here it is. We're spreading awareness that, oh shoot. Uh, Europe, they shower together. Your wife has to shower with some dude. Like trust me, that's not going to fly. Well let that go and fly. It flies. It flies in Europe, a lot of stuff flies and you're right, it doesn't fly over here. Might not necessarily be a good thing. You can't trust American men with American women in a shower together. Well, but in Europe where you've grown up with that your whole life, there aren't any incidents. We're not going to grow up with that though. Right? Well, we haven't grown up. It's not going to change. You're not going to, that would be even more ridiculous to adjust the way children growing up and say, listen kids, everyone's gonna shower together.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       Parents would freak out. They'd be like, what kind of government is this? J Well, Gary Johnson's a psychopath awareness, you know, as you were talking about earlier, just that people be aware that there are all sorts of different ways of doing things. There's also drink drinking. I mean we can go down several cul-de-sacs here, but in Europe, you know, uh, you can kids start drinking at the earliest of age. I mean like as in four or five years old and so and so. They know what alcohol is from a very young age and so they don't have near the issues with alcohol abuse. They ended up getting their driver's licenses at 21 but they can drink, you know, with the, with the consent of their parents, you know, at four years old. And so they understand the impact of alcohol and now they drive a 21 well, here in this country you can drive at 14 and I'm 14

Speaker 4:          01:00:43       in this country. It's 15, you get a learner's permit at 16 drivers license.

Speaker 3:          01:00:48       Is that what it is? It's close to New Mexico. I mean it was 14 in New Mexico. Really 13. I had that motorcycle license at 13. You could drive a motorcycle in New Mexico at 13. Now as a person

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       governance state. Um, and you look at the, what happens when someone gets an office, when, when Obama gets an office, he promises all these things, gets an office, changes almost everything. Um, what are the hurdles, I mean, what are the differences between the hurdles of someone who governs a state versus someone who governs the United States? And how much more difficult is it to change things? It seems like the United States is like, like a gigantic ship that takes so much effort to shift even slightly that these presidents get out of office eight years later exhausted looking like they've aged 50 years and very little gets done.

Speaker 3:          01:01:39       Well, uh, I think there is a silver bullet to the system and I, I hope I'm tying into what you're saying, but I do think there's a silver bullet to the system and that would be term limits. Um, I think that for the most part of politicians, once they get an office, the main concern is to stay in off. Right. And if you had term limits, I think that people would do the right thing as opposed to whatever it takes to get to me for Congress and for the Senate Congress, Senate shipping point, even anywhere, right. Well, supreme court's a, another topic, but uh, but certainly elected office agreed that we have it for the president one have it for all elected offices.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       I think I'm the best example of term limits. I really enjoyed the job. I had the opportunity to serve for two terms. So I, in my estimation, I pressed the limits term one, but not to the point where I wasn't going to get reelected. And then when I get reelected, I started off by saying, you know, let's examine the drug war in this country. I started off by saying that the marijuana should be legalized taking on what I thought at the time was, and it still remains. So as one of those really fixable things in our lives, um, that would make the world a better place. Um, but because of term limits, um, I was emboldened because I, man, I was getting out of office and there was no return.

Speaker 5:          01:03:06       Right. Um, what are your thoughts on all the other recreational drugs? Not just marijuana, but the more controversial ones, like maybe cocaine or Psilocybin, lsd, things along those lines.

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       So when I was governor of New Mexico, I had a, um, uh, I went to Portland, Oregon and judges in Portland, Oregon. There were judges that wanted to meet with me in Portland. And so I went to meet with these judges and I didn't know what the, what it was going to be about, but it was six judges, Portland, Oregon State district judges. I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label. But what they said was, was, hey, governor Johnson, we just, we're here to tell you, we completely agree with everything it is that you're saying, but we would like to share with you some stories here that, um, maybe you can pass on to others that will allow others to better understand the drug issue. They said that the really horrible drug out there as methamphetamine, that people that use methamphetamine, I'm really have their behavior altered and not in a good way.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       So it's really the Boogie drug out there. They said, um, methamphetamine is the best example that we can think of of a prohibition drug. It exists because it's cheap and it's easy to make. And what they said was, was that, hey, we're not suggesting the following, but if cocaine were legal, these people would be using cocaine instead of methamphetamine without the negative behavioral consequence. And that's true. But if the government were to tell the truth when it comes to cocaine, cocaine puts holes in your heart. People that use cocaine their entire lives are stereotypically Whitney Houston, the die before they're 50 because they die of a heart attack from using cocaine. Now will there still be people that will use cocaine knowing that they might die of a heart attack? Um, I think, I think there'd be less cocaine use if people actually knew the truth and could trust government when it comes to the truth, I just maintain that 90% of the drug problem is prohibition, unrelated, not use related. And that is not to discount the with use and abuse, but that should be the focus. When you have 8,000 deaths a year in this country, 8,000, which is staggeringly low due to cocaine and heroin overdose. And people will immediately say, well yeah, the number is so low because it's illegal. No. Um, you can argue that if it were legal, if quality quantity was known, uh, it's arguable that those desks would significantly decrease. Although there will always be people that will commit suicide. Always

Speaker 4:          01:05:50       be people that will push the limits. Yes, you're, you're always going to have people that abuse everything. Everything, everything. Everything. I mean we're, we're living in a culture that has alcohol available at every block all over the world. I mean, everywhere you go, there's a restaurant or a bar or somewhere that you can buy enough alcohol to drink yourself to death. It's readily available. Yet when you consider the amount of people that actually drink alcohol, the, the, the low number of deaths is pretty incredible. And it's because we're aware of the effects of alcohol and it's pretty, when you get a bottle of Jack Daniel's, it is pretty consistent. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:06:24       uh, but there are 100,000 deaths a year that are contributed, uh, that, uh, get contributed to alcohol consumption. And I'm not talking about drinking and driving or, or violence committed under the alcohol abuse, alcohol, alcohol abuse. Statistically, no one dies

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       from marijuana. So that was what I was going to get to was that when you look at what's happening in Colorado, one of the more interesting things is the lesson of violent crime and drunk driving. Those are two effects that have dropped pretty drastically, noticeably, statistically because of the legalization of marijuana that you would reduce because of the legalization of a less harmful, more peaceful drug. You'd reduce the effects of uh, what's right now a readily available and incredibly prevalent drug.

Speaker 3:          01:07:12       I have always maintained that legalizing marijuana will make for a better planet on the medicinal side of marijuana. Um, marijuana products directly compete with legal prescription drugs, pain killers, antidepressants that statistically kill 100,000 people a year. No, no documented death due to marijuana on the recreational side. I've always maintained that legalizing marijuana will lead to less overall substance abuse because people are going to find it as such a safer alternative than everything else that's out there. Starting with alcohol, the campaign to legalize marijuana in Colorado, uh, was a campaign based on marijuana is safer than alcohol. And Joe, as you were pointing out all the statistics that all the naysayers were going to go south, I have gone have gone better. They're less traffic incidents. There's less overall crime in the state of Colorado. Colorado is vibrant and does

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       it have to do with marijuana? I think that that's an ingredient, uh, comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant right now.

Speaker 4:          01:08:23       Question, blame, unquestionable. And I think a prime example of how screwy the system gets when people lobby against the legalization of things that don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp is illegal federally and that we're trying to make it legal and trying to make it legal statewide and in various states and start production of hemp. But hemp is not psychoactive. It's crazy. We, we, we can sell hemp products in this country, but they come from China. My company, we buy it or my company on it. We buy it from Canada. We buy hemp protein from Canada and they can't grow it in America. We can import it, but we can't grow it. CBD, CBD oil. Yes. Same thing. Not psychoactive helps pain. Very effective for people. It's not getting people hire, it's not ruining lives is not doing anything. But there's a lot of people that are concerned that are making money off of the alternatives, especially with hemp. I mean, that was the reason why marijuana was made illegal in the first place.

Speaker 2:          01:09:22       That's the reason it was about hemp, the conspiracy of dupont to promote nylon as opposed to, uh, and, and of course they, Randolph hearst, they per factories, they made a, they made a marijuana illegal, but because the marijuana plant and the hemp plant look the same, then hence hemp was also made illegal. I mean, that was the,

Speaker 4:          01:09:47       the conspiracy. Yeah. Well that's a, I mean, that's all been proven. So it's, we're in a strange time that it's 2016 it's still illegal getting slowly starting to become legal and people starting to, I believe in Kentucky and a few other states, they're allowing farmers to profit off of this incredibly vibrant plant that's easy to grow, doesn't require pesticides, has a variety of uses as a textile, as a commodity for food, a full amino acid profile. It makes amazing clothes and making this jacket, this is made out of hemp. I mean,

Speaker 2:          01:10:19       if it's, if, if the marijuana plant were discovered today in the Amazon, it would be hailed as the greatest discovery of humankind in 1999. Good News. Bad News here. In 1999 I was the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana in 2016 bad news, I'm still the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana. Although Bernie Sanders apparently rolled out of bed, hit his head, and now he's come to that same epiphany. Wonderful. I'm glad. But in 1999 rolled out of bed and hit his head aw, well that he came to this epiphany at this point in his life. He's never said it before. Uh, no. Not until he's been running for a, for Senate. So you think it's like one of those, Lick your finger, put it up in the air, check where the breeze is going. I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd, but, but in 1999, 30% of Americans supported legalizing marijuana in 2016, 60% of Americans now are supporting the legalization of marijuana and not one politician outside of Bernie Sanders in office. Um, is, and when I say elected official at the congressional, senatorial or gubernatorial level, not one politician in that group outside of Bernie Sanders, myself have a spouse legalizing marijuana. I think what a disconnect.

Speaker 5:          01:11:45       What an incredible disconnect between what people think and our elected officials. It's, it's also because when people take a stand on something that's controversial, it's, it's risky and politics are about minimizing risk. It's about getting people to like you as much as possible, going down the middle as much as possible term limits, term limits. I want to stay in office more than I want to do the right thing. Do you think that ultimately the idea of having one individual that's the figurehead of an entire nation is archaic?

Speaker 2:          01:12:14       No, no. I, you know, I, I, I'm certainly is, is our system perfect? Uh, no, but is it

Speaker 5:          01:12:24       perhaps the best system? So if we woke up to today and there was no government at all, would you think that we would possibly create one guy that runs the whole thing? We would, we would agree that that would be the best way to run things.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       Um, I have a theory that the best way to run things would be that, uh, every 16 years we would have a benevolent dictator takeover for two years. So what would happen, and those are the days, the other 14 years, well, the other six, 16 years you'd have elected officials and then for two years you'd have a benevolent dictator step in and right. All the wrongs that, but of course the problem is, is well then how do you, how not sizeable someone could fake being benevolent, trying to be funny here, but trying to bring out a point that, that actually, that if you could have that benevolent dictator step in and right the wrongs that elect, we don't live in a democracy in this country. It's not a democracy. We live in a constitutional republic. We are a republic, were governed by laws. The laws are the constitution. We democratically elect our representatives. But in a democracy, the demise of every democracy is, is that, uh, at some point in a democracy, people vote themselves a raise and it becomes unaffordable. Um, Nazi Germany was a democracy before it became, before Hitler took power.

Speaker 5:          01:13:53       So what would be the, I mean, besides your 16 year to year benevolent dictator, thanks. What would be the way to fix the current system? Like say if Gary Johnson gets an office, what would you do? What would be one of the first things you did?

Speaker 2:          01:14:08       Well, I, I do think that government is too, that it tries to

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       accomplish too much, uh, if, if, if at a minimum a Gary Johnson were able to just put a cap on spending the, uh, the impact of that. When you consider, um, when you consider the ultimate impact of inflation and how that's going to kick in and how that's going to so adversely affect our lives, that would write a lot of wrongs because you do have economic growth. You tie that with the fact that you just put a, just, I'm trying to, I'm trying to put the most minimal bars out there possible that would really have a positive impact going forward from a, uh, for my financial standpoint. And it isn't just financial, it is about liberty and freedom. It's about your liberty. It's about your freedom. It's about you making decisions in your own lives. It's about the fact that the government, that crony capitalism is alive and well, that there are favors granted to those that have money as opposed to a level playing field that everybody would actually have an equal shot at the opportunity that, uh, that there currently is unavailable because of government and the actual protections that exist for those that do have money as opposed to those that don't.

Speaker 4:          01:15:30       So once you get into office, how would you go about minimizing

Speaker 3:          01:15:34       government? Well, uh, without any legislation whatsoever. Um, and I am speaking now having been governor in New Mexico for eight years, I ran all of state government. I pointed the heads of all the agencies. And from that standpoint, the idea was was just to make things better. And what's the definition of better? Well, that uh, the average person on the street would have to spend less time and less money dealing with government. And by spending less time and less money on government, that means that you would actually be able to pursue the things that were important in your life. And that is not to minimize government's role, which fundamentally is to protect us against individuals, groups, corporations, foreign governments that would

Speaker 4:          01:16:22       do us harm. So going back to what we had discussed earlier, that when government gets too big, you reach a point of diminishing returns. When it becomes to so swollen that it requires so much money to stay up, that it's just, it doesn't, it doesn't support itself. You, you, it gets too large. So what do you cut? So say you get into office and you look at the current system we have right now. You look at all the bureaucracy and the red tape. What do you start to Chapo?

Speaker 3:          01:16:45       Well what I did in New Mexico, and I said I would do this when I went in New Mexico, is that I wasn't going to fire anybody, but let's just manage attrition. Let's just have some common sense here. Let's not grow it anymore. Let's just at a minimum it's not going to grow anymore and it will shrink because there will be attrition. So how about the notion of a, as people leave, as people, you know, quit retire that you just not backfill those positions. And as so when I left off us, there were 1200 fewer state employees. And when I got there, I think it was a testament to better government because people were doing more, um, with, with less resource. And I think everybody saw that New Mexico was a state that's two to one democrat. Um, I made a name for myself, pinching pennies, being frugal, just like we're frugal in our lives at least. I certainly am, um, difference between cheap and frugal, but I'm pretty frugal cat.

Speaker 4:          01:17:44       So what do you do with something that's very controversial and often criticized? Like Homeland Security? Like there was an article that came out yesterday about homeland security going after the using homeland security to go after massage parlors for uh, giving sex to people for, you know, handjobs yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       I would have never in the f in the first place, I would have never established the Department of Homeland Security. Now as president, um, I either get to sign or veto legislation, I would sign legislation that would abolish the Department of Homeland Security or I would merge it with the FBI. Just think we do have too many agencies and when you hear about a story like homeland security going into a massage parlor, I, I just get outraged.

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       What causes that? This is what I wanted to get to. Like what, how does that happen? How does homeland security, something that's set up to prevent terrorist attacks? How does it eventually get bastardized and distorted to the point where they're utilizing the legislation that was put in place to protect people from terrorist attacks to stop guys getting handjobs. It's human nature. It's the Peter Principle.

Speaker 3:          01:18:52       It's when you're assigned to a job in government, the more important you are is the more work that you have. So you literally create your, you, you create the work that you have, you, you, you, you try and expand. You try and grow. Well, that's the private sector, not the public sector, public sector. People that get involved in the public sector. They think that success is, is growing their mandate. I mean it's just, that's, it's that simple, but someone has to approve that. Like someone has to say, well, after the massage parlors, sadly in this case, where's the president of the United States, the president of United States could step into this in a nanosecond and say, Whoa, stop.

Speaker 4:          01:19:35       But is it possible that he's not aware of it because you're looking at it is possible, but so many things to be aware of.

Speaker 3:          01:19:41       Well, it has governor of New Mexico. Here's something I did as governor in New Mexico on. It's something I would do as president of the United States as governor of New Mexico. I set up this open door after four policy where the third Thursday of every month I saw anyone in the state of New Mexico starting at four o'clock in the afternoon until 10 o'clock at the evening in the evening on five minute increments. And it was amazing Joe, the stories of people that came in and what they had to say, now they could come in for anything, come in for a picture with me. They come in to visit me with me for five minutes. They could come in and talk about here's a government atrocity that's happening to me and I'd like you to fix it. And I always viewed it from the standpoint of, well, this is one person that's come in, but you know what?

Speaker 3:          01:20:24       Everybody that's dealing with this same situation is having the same outcomes as this person. It was an incredibly valuable tool. As president of the United States, I would set up an open door after four policy for atrocities in government for a waste, fraud and abuse atrocities. So door after four but you're talking about 300 million people, right? So we have an open door for five minutes available for 300 million people in six door. Well this would, this, this would be, there would be a criteria for it and it would be, um, you, you could, I, I'm, I'm certain I could make this happen, but yes, I'm certain that, I mean I think that's a great idea for a governor. Maybe a better idea for a mayor. But when you get to a precedent, is that really a way to what handles some things? So what is the mechanism?

Speaker 3:          01:21:21       I'm just saying I think I can make this mechanism work that as a result of having this mechanism, I'm going to find out in a very short amount of time that the Department of homeland security is busting massage parlors. I'm gonna, I'm gonna put, find that out just as easily through twitter. Yes. And so I'm going to be connected that way too. But waste, fraud and abuse. The Marine One helicopter, I was more thinking in terms of the Marine One helicopter was, well it was a contract that went from $4 billion to $16 billion without a single helicopter being delivered because you had a, you had, um, the military a hierarchy on a committee that determined that a, they wanted this helicopter to be steel instead of aluminum. And this was a boost of Westland. And in a nutshell, they come up with a completely redesigned helicopter as opposed to the original bid, which was off the shelf.

Speaker 3:          01:22:15       Uh, that would have been 4 billion. Now it's 16 billion and they haven't, uh, they haven't flown a helicopter. Well, if you had a waste fraud and abuse, um, open door after four, um, I'd, if I'd have known about it and I would've stepped right in the middle of it. But is that waste fraud or abuse or is it just innovation and the expenses involved and changing a design. But the Pid, the bid originally was for off the shelf helicopters that they were building, uh, and that there was going to be bolt on avionics. And the first thing that this military procurement committee said was, we don't want an aluminum frame. We want to steel frame, well steel frame that meant that, um, that uh, everything had to be redesigned, the engines had to be bigger. The fuel, the right, so is that waste. You would go into waste. It wouldn't be fraud or abuse

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       necessarily waste total to work. You know what, where's the logic behind that? But as an engineering decision based on like real knowledge that we have about the rigidity of steel versus aluminum or what does, what does the, she would think that a Gustaf Westland,

Speaker 2:          01:23:20       a helicopter manufacturing, um, business with an off the shelf Heloc, a helicopter that exists, that existed. That's what the government want this and, and it transformed into a completely new helicopter that has yet to fly.

Speaker 5:          01:23:39       That sounds insane. It's insane. It is insane. It's insane. Is that there was originally agreed upon without, I mean if they had like an order and the initial order, they had an initial order, what was the reasoning for making the steel frame? What was the reasoning for changing? Did it that, uh, that the, uh, that the order then had to go to this pure cureman committee for any tweaks and you'd have to think that there are tweaks, but this wasn't a tweak as an enzyme tweak that's redesigning an incredibly new,

Speaker 2:          01:24:12       it's about as nutty as it gets. Flint water, uh, you know, the, the flint water crisis. Why didn't I tell you what that just sounds about as a troche's as it gets when it comes to government turning its back on, on an obvious situation. I think about, um, so I'm reading about it and as governor of New Mexico, I guarantee you that residents from flint would have been at my open door after four saying, look, I got dirty water and I would have got into the middle of, I'd like to think Joe, that I would've gotten into the middle of it immediately. But you know what, if I didn't get into it immediately, I'm guessing my second door open door after four, instead of having four people show up from flint, would have 80 people showing up from flint point is it would not have gone unnoticed by me as governor.

Speaker 2:          01:25:01       And I had gotten right into the middle of it and I had a mechanism for doing it. And there needs to be a mechanism for the president of United States to stay in touch. The imperial presidency of the, the notion that the president, whenever the president travels, it's, it's tens of millions of dollars every time he travels. Well, that's, if I'm elected president United States, that's going to change dramatically. Does Air Force One really need to fly a everywhere? Gosh, you wouldn't think so. Why can't the prison, the United States come into Los Angeles, uh, in a, in a very stealth way and uh, and travel without having to block a all of traffic in Los Angeles, which you have to f experience many times.

Speaker 5:          01:25:46       Yeah, that's pretty gross. Well also, why do they have to fly in Air Force One? How come they can't just get an American airlines all

Speaker 2:          01:25:52       come well or how bout, how bout one of those? Uh, how about one of those corporate aircraft that, uh, are in the military that would cost a 10th of what the Air Force One causes the benefits

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       of Air Force One is air force one of some sort of a pod where the president can parachute to, saves you. They tried to shoot it down or something crazy like that. You wonder about that one. But, uh, what about a, what about an ejection seat? I mean, James Bond's goes on and on and on. I mean, yeah, I can handle the objection. You get handled being rejected. I could handle being ejected. I'm uncertain about it. I mean, we could go on and on about things. One of those lines, it seems a little, a little silly, but it's a little silly. The whole thing has become not just a little silly. It's become pretty crazy. Well. Also when you isolate the president and you make them this person, they have to shut down all the city streets and bring in a gigantic parade of storm troopers that have to stand by his side and you know what it would be?

Speaker 1:          01:26:52       It'd be great to, as President United States to just shuttle around in an f 16 I'm going to let him shoot me down and an f 16 I'll just take the back seat and I'm speaking now as well. They don't go very far, you know that they don't go very far, but they go really fast and when we're talking about, we're talking about money and dollars as opposed to have 16 Ra. Actually it sounds like you just want to be in enough 16 no, no. I just want to, I just want to spend less money. I want to be a frugal cat in the White House. What kind of odds do you think there are? I mean this, this election is a very tricky obviously, but what kind of odds do you believe there are for 2020 I think, first of all, I would not be doing this if there weren't the opportunity to win, but the only opportunity that there is of winning is to be in the presidential debates.

Speaker 1:          01:27:45       That's the only chance. Now, what's the keys into the presidential debates? Kind of where we started off. I used to be in the pole. Doesn't that seem insane? That what you have to get in this one thing, this presidential debates is thing that is [inaudible]. It is the reality. Yeah. No, no, maybe not. I mean maybe that's not the insane part. Does it? Does it not seem logical that anyone who can mathematically be elected president in 2012 that would have included the Libertarian Party and the Green Party? Does it not seem logical that anyone capable of being mathematically elected president in United States, 270 electoral votes should at a minimum be included in the polls, that there'd be a requirement that, and you know that I'm in a 2016 there are like 1600 people that registered to run for president. Wasn't Roseanne Barr one of them. Uh, that was, that was 2012. That was 2012 but anybody can run for president. You got to do is sign up with the Federal Elections Commission and you can run for president. But at the end of the day, in 2012 there were only four people that could have mathematically been elected. Doesn't that

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       seem fair?

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       Well, it doesn't seem well, the two party system is the biggest hurdle right now for it. I think most people, when you think about the potential of running for president, the biggest hurdle is that you have to be accepted and you have to be the nominee of one of these two parties, right?

Speaker 3:          01:29:20       Oh. Or that you'll be included in the polls. And right now because of just how polarizing hillary and a trump are, that just being in the polls, that that will register enough, a dissatisfaction with any third party name in this case me. Um, that, um, I'd, I'd like to think that all the things that we've talked about right now, you, you were, you wouldn't hear out of the mouths of either hillary or

Speaker 5:          01:29:48       trump. I don't believe you would. I don't believe you would even hear it from the mouth of Obama. I think everybody would be much more measured.

Speaker 3:          01:29:55       What I've said about Obama from the very beginning, and I'll still say it today, is there anything that he says that you can really disagree with? I've always said that everything that comes out of his mouth is like music. It's just the reality hasn't matched up

Speaker 5:          01:30:07       with the words so, well, the real problem is a lot of the stuff that he said running versus what he's done in office, right? The hope and change website that talks about whistle blowers and then you look at his actual actions towards whistle blowers and actual actions towards the press. It's, it's pretty disturbing that, well, back to my open door after four or for whistle blowers, look, come on in and talk to me. Tell me, tell me about what's going on. Well, that was what I wanted to get to next. Maybe I can jump into the middle of it. That's what I wanted to get to next. So you're president, how do you handle Julian assange? How do you handle Edward Snowden? What do you do about these two very high profile situations where most people believe that the information that they released was very important to the American public. Very important to understanding what the government is actually doing.

Speaker 3:          01:30:59       So, um, I'm, I'm, I believe in dreams. Well, Julian asage is not been charged. I don't think by the US government. We know what's really going on though. Well, we know what's really going on. I mean, Julia was on Snowden. Yes. You Pardon? Snowden. I, you know that he has brought to the forefront this, uh, you know, this mass surveillance, but just but to play Sozo Joe, so, okay, go ahead. Yeah. The entire NSA is an executive order 12, three, three, three under truman. Uh, you could repeal that executive order to simply turn the satellites. So wave from you and I this if they, if you do 10 million, verizon uses this metadata collection, you can, you can, it's my understanding that you, by executive order, you could actually turn the satellites, uh, on the bad guys as to US citizens.

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       But don't you think that if someone actually did that, they'd probably put you in a convertible and roll you through Dallas. Uh, that's also a possibility to say you're going to get rid of the NSA or diminish the NSA or the CIA or the FBI.

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       You, you would be in a bad place. It's, it's kind of work with them, right? Isn't that the best way to handle it and still keep your head? Or how bout, how bout the notion of really just doing the right thing? And so the Edward Snowden situation, did you see the snowden movie that, uh, what was it called, citizen for citizen for everybody listening got a c it, Edward Snowden. I mean, he laid it all out there. It wasn't about him, it was about the information. He gave all the information to media saying, I do not in any way have the resources to release this data because if I release this data, maybe I'm going to put people in harm's way. I don't want to put people's in people in harm's way. So I'm giving this up to a, I can't remember the institutions that he gave it up too, but he said, I, I'm sure they have the resources that, uh, they will be able to disseminate this information. And um, and not pete put p uh, it was just an excellent, excellent documentary on what I will say is a real American Patriot

Speaker 5:          01:33:22       was a docu drama writers dramatization. No, it was, it was, which one was the drama? Doesn't it? One wasn't there one that was a dramatization. It coming out soon. That's a dramatization. Okay. Okay. So citizen four was the actual documentary. It was the actual documentary. Where were, when they showed up, it was Edward Snowden and they showed up. They didn't know who Edward Snowden was. They didn't, it was amazing. You've got, you've got to see it. You've got to see. I'll definitely say it. Yeah. Um, to play devil's advocate, if you do pardon Snowden, that means that if there was a crime being committed at all, that crime is being committed by the NSA. If you, if you demonize snowden, as soon as they arrest Doden or they try to rest snowden and they say the snowdens a bad guy, what he's done is terrible. If it comes the United States, we're absolutely going to arrest him.

Speaker 5:          01:34:06       What you're saying is, and they're putting the, the focus on him as a potential criminal. Well, if, if somehow or another he is exonerated and he's really, well, what happened then? Well, is there a crime? Well, if he's exonerated, if he's done something that violates the whatever agreement that he had to sign in order to work for the NSA, that means that the crime that he exposed was so significant that it was valid for him to violate whatever agreement he signed with the federal government. That right now they're pursuing him as a criminal for which means someone needs to go to jail for the crime if they're, if they're not going to put him in jail

Speaker 3:          01:34:45       and prosecute him. Interesting way of looking at it. I look at it from the standpoint of this is a mistake that we've made. Let's acknowledge the mistake and let's, uh, let's move forward. Let's correct as so I'm

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       not knocking that simple, right? We had, may not be, but, um, I'm not looking at this from, uh, from the standpoint of prosecuting people as much as we've made a mistake. Let's correct it is this is what this country is really about. They're still moving forward with this data collection thing in Utah unabated. And when you have testimony before Congress, it says, are you spying on the American people? And the response is, uh, well, let's see. Are, is their mass surveillance of the American public going on? And when they said, no, the question should have been total surveillance as mass surveillance. What does that mean? Thousands of people? Well, no, we're talking about a hundred. So he says no, the answer being hundreds of millions of total surveillance, master males surveillance as far as mass surveillance. So it's correct. It's actually honest. If they know we're, we're pursing, we're parsing things here, but come on, we're, we've been misled.

Speaker 1:          01:35:58       This is, this is not the country that uh, we fought wars to preserve. Does this go back to what we're talking about before? Were businesses tend to lean towards growth? So the NSA is involved in growth and they don't want to stop? I think so. It's the Peter Principle. It's a, I'm, I want to justify my life and button to justify my, and these are, I'm talking about bureaucrats, nows justify my life. I need to grow what it is I'm doing. I need to prove that what I'm doing so important that I need people working for me. I need to expand what I'm doing because it's so important. So what would you be able to do if anything, as a president? So you get into office and with Ensa. Yes. It's, it just came to my, this just came to my attention like 10 days ago, that the NSA is an executive order under truman, that the president of the United States could repeal immediately.

Speaker 1:          01:36:53       God, that would be ugly. Why would it be, they wouldn't let you do that? Why wouldn't they say, well, nothing is simple. Nothing is simple. I do not want to downplay on, on the complexity of what this might entail, but at the end of the day, um, is it possible to turn the satellites away from you? And I will. That would be the thing be that we would want to get rid of the NSA. What would it want to be as maybe redirect their efforts? Wow. Like, as in protecting us again, having an indigo, uh, having a, uh, uh, an impenetrable national defense is an impenetrable national defense. Does that, I mean, this is, or William, this is, this is 1984 they've got the satellites on to us. Yeah. It is bizarre. It's bizarre that they've just randomly decided to get the entire country under surveillance when there's no evidence to point that you know, you're, you're stopping anything or eliminating anything, but you are putting people in a compromised because

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       if people know that the government has been paying attention to all of their emails and voicemails and all that jazz, then people will adjust their behavior. They'll be a little bit more cautious that a little bit more cautious with their criticism and if you are ever in a situation, yes, exactly. And if you're ever in a situation where you are against the government in any way, they will have so much data on you. Like if you, if you're one of those people that decides to Edward Snowden it from here on out, boy, good luck with that. I mean they will instantly be pulling up emails and voicemails and, and you've got a real problem on your hands because it's not just met a data, right. I mean that's also been proven. We don't even know. We don't know. Nobody knows. You remember the guy who initially was the whistle blower? Many,

Speaker 3:          01:38:43       many areas. There are many of them. There are many of them that are in prison for

Speaker 4:          01:38:48       the same, yeah, well there's a gentleman that was one of the original whistle blowers who was actually one of the coders who was working with the NSA when they first started designing this sort of program and he resigned and went public with all of this and he was, um, when he was vilified and when Edward Snowden came out with all of this information, this guy started doing interviews again and he started saying like, listen, this is, I was talking about this in the early two thousands I, this is something they'd been putting into play for a long time during the Bush administration. They started us all off

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       the NSA. The, yeah. Yeah. I think it goes back further than that.

Speaker 4:          01:39:30       Yeah, I think it does too. It's a true, here's the guy, Bill, Bill Binney, the original NSA whistleblower unstowed in nine 11 and illegal surveillance. It's a very, very interesting story. There's, there's several interviews with this guy. This one is from computer weekly, but there's several interviews with is this gentleman, he was the original blowing what was a year of this Jamie? Cause I want to say 2007 but I might be wrong. It doesn't say, um, what does it matter? Bill Binney is the guy and I've seen him interviewed several times and he realized while this was all going on, he's like, you're not looking for criminals. You're trying to spy on everyone. You can't do this. And I think we all agree that you shouldn't be able to do that. But right now that's happening.

Speaker 3:          01:40:15       And, and very simply, there is a process. The fourth amendment there is due process. So if there's a bad guy out there that the, uh, the federal government wants to spy on, you get a warrant, got to get a warrant. It's how it should be. But this, uh, Pfizer court where the government goes before the Pfizer court and says, we want authority to, uh, to collect metadata on 110 million verizon users. I fail to see where that's due process in any way shape

Speaker 4:          01:40:42       I have no one has made an argument against that. No one, no one has made an argument that makes any sense whatsoever supporting that. So if that's the case, why is it president allow it? Good question. Good. If he's the guy that has all this music coming out of his mouth, what are his words that are so beautiful and melodic about this? A lot of water. What's the word? Well

Speaker 2:          01:41:02       that's the, that's the big go. Obama disappointment is, um, I'm sure if we went into the archives he would have been addressed. Well maybe he wouldn't have, cause he wouldn't have even known about this metadata collection. But

Speaker 4:          01:41:14       I do. Well, he was the, in the hope and change website when he was running for president, one of the things he was talking about was supporting whistleblowers that are revealing criminal activity. Well, he's directly contradicted that. I mean, he's everything he's done in regards to people blowing whistles and revealing government problems. He's, he's prosecuted them. They'd been worse on freedom of the press than any other president. We will look at Bush as being like this really terrible like a draconian guy, but the Bush administration was easier on whistle blowers and easier on press and trying to get pressed to reveal their sources. Then the Obama administration back to back to the reality. Not matching up at all. Exactly. Yeah. The reality, not matching up at all, not just with the words but with the, the appearance, like it's the appearance of this, this really educated like socially aware guy who gets into play black. Finally, we've got this articulate, intelligent, well read president. This is a relief from the guy who, you know, stumbles through words and says a bunch of stupid shit. Like this is our guy. This is our guy. Finally. But then same practices, in fact, worse, worse, more drone attacks, more. I mean, what do you do about that? What do you do about a program that the drone attacks have resulted in? I believe the numbers, like more than 80% accidental death or more than 80% civilians being killed versus the intended target.

Speaker 2:          01:42:47       Well, this is the unintended consequence of our military interventions, that they're making things worse, not better. And I am talking about boots on the ground. I'm talking about dropping bombs and the fact that drones do fly and kill thousands of innocent people.

Speaker 4:          01:43:03       And when I had Mike Baker on, who was a former CIA operative, when he, when he and I were discussing this, he, he was saying that, look, what you're seeing is lawyers make those decisions, these decisions of whether to bomb or not to bomb. They're being done by lawyers. They sit down, they let go over the possibilities, they go over the risks versus reward, and they make the call. What the fuck kind of world is that? That's the world that I'm with. That's the world that can be changed, I think. So here's the big battle ship. It's the United States. Well, yeah, super tank or whatever you would call it.

Speaker 2:          01:43:39       Well first you got your cruiser first. You know, it's, what is it? What is it at six months it takes six miles to turn the six super tanker around. Turn it around 180 degrees. Well first you got to stop the engines first. First you got to actually start the process. Yeah. And, okay, so it's six miles before you can actually pull the uturn. Well, we're, we're full steam ahead. We're still full steam ahead.

Speaker 5:          01:44:01       Okay. So let's talk military. So you're, you're in office, obviously you need to protect people. Obviously there's threats out there, both a broad and locally. What do you do in terms of minimizing the amount of money that we spend on the military? Minimizing the amount of invasion of privacy that the branches of the military, like things like the NSA, which I guess you consider the military, some sort of security apparatus for us. Right. What would you consider the NSA? Is that military? What would you consider it? I don't know. National Security Administration, but I mean, obviously it's, some has to do with the military, right? Has To be oversight or has to, has to be, has to be some transparency. So when you're talking about the military, how do you go about minimizing the impact or minimizing the negative aspects of it? Well, um, make no bones. If we're attacked, we're going to attack back, that we should have an impenetrable national defense,

Speaker 2:          01:45:01       but we're anything but defense. Whereas Congress in all of this, uh, they've abdicated their responsibility to declare war for the American people to have a discussion and debate over how the military should proceed. They've abdicated that responsibility to the president of the United States who's doing this, uh, on executive. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:45:23       Border along with the military. That's where I rack got really weird, right? Where it wasn't an actual act of war. Wasn't that right? That

Speaker 2:          01:45:30       congress had allowed, had, well, the Congress has allowed the president to carry on this, um, uh, to do what the president sees fit. Well, that, that is, that's my opinion. That's an abdication of, of constitutional responsibility by Congress. So let's reestablish that. I think the biggest threat in the world right now is, um, is North Korea and the fact that at some point, uh, Kim, uh, is at some point these intercontinental ballistic missiles are going to work. And this guy isn't not so hot about the notion of, um, really getting together with China because this is in China's best interest to, uh, to get rid of Kim unify the Koreas, um, get American troops out of South Korea. Um, if Cuba, look, we didn't, we didn't put up for a second that, uh, that Russia was going to occupy or have missiles in, uh, uh, in Cuba.

Speaker 2:          01:46:34       Do you think China likes the fact that we got 40,000 troops in Korea? Uh, no. They don't like it a bit. Well, do we not make the world a lot more secure if we can't come to terms with, uh, with China on how we can, with what I will argue the biggest threat in the world right now in China is an ally of North Korea, correct? They are, but they're an embarrassment to from all that I can glean. They're an embarrassment. A 70% of South Korea's trade export goes to China. None of North Korea's export goes to China because there is no product to export. Um, it's, it's, well, but it's turned that ship around. Boy, you want to talk about turning a tough ship around the North Korea ship when you're talking about an entire brainwash country. It's a very sad, sad state. China is not blind to that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:29       Let's take advantage of, um, let's take advantage of, uh, of establishing a partnership and alliance with China to deal with that, but there are already so poor and so screwed over. What do you do as opposed metairie intervention as opposed to us as opposed to us dealing with it. It's in China's best interest to deal with this and so that China has, what are, they have this island that they build 40 miles off their coast or whatever it is. What's, what's the big deal? The United States does this all the time. What's the big deal? Big Deal. In what way? Like what do you say? Well, this is somehow a threat to US security that a, you know, that they've built an island 40 miles off of their mainland. Um, I don't get it. We're spending more on out. We're spending as much money on our military as the all the other nations in the world combined.

Speaker 2:          01:48:23       What does that say? Does that say maybe we're spending more than our fair share talk about? Well that's also were the number one superpower in the world. And in order to maintain that position and be the benevolent dictators, well, and to what, to what end, to what end are we maintaining that position? What, what, what is the end game here where the end game is to provide national, impenetrable national defense for our country? I mean, um, I don't want to put troops in harm's way. I don't, I don't want, I don't want men and women dying in situations where that does not have to take place. You know, that fact they get injured, they come back here, the rest of their lives there. They're affected by

Speaker 5:          01:49:09       stop. I agree with you. But to play devil's advocate and take their point of view, they would say that what they're doing overseas is saving things from happening here and keeping people safe by intervening in other countries, by blocking things from taking place. I mean, this would be the argument for a large prevalent military that is this all right.

Speaker 2:          01:49:31       The world. That is always the argument. But the reality is, is that these interventions at best make things the same or leave things the same but versus get worse.

Speaker 5:          01:49:42       That's what their argument would be like if they weren't doing this, that you would have the superpowers developed in these other countries and it would become a gigantic issue. Whether it's Iran, whether it's Russia, whether it's whatever it is, take it rock for an example,

Speaker 3:          01:49:55       we intervene in Iraq. Um, the biggest threat to Iran was Iraq with Saddam Hussein. That that's all their concern was, was how, how did they deal with Saddam Hussein in Iraq? We go in and we'd take out Saddam Hussein. Well, now all of a sudden we cut the head of that hydro off. Now all of a sudden we have to deal with Iran. Something that we weren't having to deal with before. That's an unintended consequence.

Speaker 5:          01:50:20       Do we need to deal with Iran? I mean, what is the reason why we have to deal with Iran?

Speaker 3:          01:50:25       They're the biggest funder of terrorism in the world. They fund terrorism. Um, there's, it's undeniable. So at first I was in support of this treaty and naively, meaning the treaty that we signed with Iran that, uh, ended up releasing however much money it was, $160 billion in by secretary Kerry's own image admission, uh, question was, will, will there not be funds that will get directed at terrorism? And he said, yes, there will be funds that will be directed at terrorism. So how on earth could we have signed that agreement with Iran given the fact that they are the biggest funder of terrorism

Speaker 5:          01:51:06       world? What is their motivation of fund terrorism? Is their motivation to fund terrorism because they're concerned with the United States continuing to develop power in the Middle East? Like what is there? Well, it could be a common devil's advocate. Yeah. No, no, no. It could be a con. I don't want to

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       discount anything that's being said by anyone, but from our standpoint, um, this is w we're, we're contributing to what will be, um, more terrorism because terrorism will get funded from some of this money that got freed up.

Speaker 5:          01:51:40       Now when you say that, when you say funding terrorism specifically, what do you mean?

Speaker 3:          01:51:44       Well, where were we at some point the these terrorist groups and I'm not, and who's to say, where are the connection using Brussels as an example? Who's to say where those guys were getting their funds from their support from? Well, um, it's not a stretch to say that it may have come from Iran,

Speaker 5:          01:52:08       but isn't that a big statement that should be qualified?

Speaker 3:          01:52:12       Well, regardless of whether it's Brussels or, or wherever, at some point the funding for terrorism has results. And in this case, if you are allowing a contributor to terrorism to have funds to contribute as the United States, um, are, are we not making the situation worse when we go in and militarily intervene and leave equipment, uh, Afghanistan, we leave equipment, we ended up arming the Taliban when the,

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       when the Russians leave, the Taliban is equipped to, they're equipped with a US arms because we use the Taliban to fight, um, the Russians.

Speaker 5:          01:52:56       Right. But to bring them back to Iran. What if any evidence is available that shows that I ran funded terrorism,

Speaker 2:          01:53:02       uh, unequivocal. Uh, I, I can't state for you the ABC's of it, but, um, unequivocal sec, secretary of State, um, Carrie, uh, was asked the question, well, isn't some of this money, some of it going to get directed at funding terrorism? And his response was, yeah, you, yes, some of it unquestionably is going to get directed toward terrorism. I don't know how we can, how we could have a okayed that given, given what has been acknowledged, what is the benefit of giving them money? You know, uh, I'm, I'm all for the free trade. Um, I think that free trade at the end of the day is a really powerful tool. Um, I don't have the answer to this and I don't want to, I don't want to misstate anything, but this is a conversation that we're having a could we have not opened up free trade with Iran and still kept their assets frozen. And by that, that uh, assets that, that now they enter into the world community that they can sell their oil and on an ongoing basis, um, um, w we'll have free trade with Iran. They can spend the money as they see fit. But with regard to the money that's been frozen, um, if, if, if we believe that any of that's going to be redirected or directed at terrorism, why did we do that? I don't, I, I, I'm just saying I W I don't get it.

Speaker 5:          01:54:33       Well, what has been the response by the administration? I mean there's this question been brought up and what have they, how have they answered it?

Speaker 2:          01:54:40       Well, that was the, this was, this was, gosh, maybe, I don't know, six months ago and Carrie was asked cause and you know, it was very matter of factly. Yes. Some of it's going to get redirected to, you know, you have to I think is, I'm a secondhand or firsthand. I mean I'm repeating what I thought I heard him say, which was, yeah, unquestionably, some of this is going to go to terrorism. I don't get it.

Speaker 5:          01:55:05       Okay, well we don't have specifics to discuss when it comes to that, like specific facts. So it gets, it gets it. And we got, we got the Internet and going. Yeah, we definitely do. Um, I wonder what, if anything can be done to calm some of the areas down in the world. Um, and how much of what's going on in the world is about controlling resources and how much of that would change if we had less reliance on fossil fuels?

Speaker 2:          01:55:35       Well, we're not getting any of our oil right now from a, from the Middle East. We're not getting the enacting well, we are fracking and, and, and, uh, that statement is not completely true. We are getting oil from all over the world, but, so our refineries here in the United States, so, so there's a, there's a trade off where we're x sporting really clean oil or oil that doesn't need as much refining and we're importing oil that is dirty so it's cheaper. So there's a more of a profit margin to bring in dirty oil, refine it, and make more money by exporting cleaner oil that refineries overseas can handle as opposed to the United States. So there is that going on. But for the most part, we are, we're energy sufficient, uh, at the moment because of fracking.

Speaker 5:          01:56:28       But when we entered into Iraq, one of the more cynical concerns was that we were doing it because we were trying to control natural resources. We were sure.

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       Yes. And at that time, I think that that, I mean, did that not play a part in the equation? Certainly the administration denied that, but, um, everybody I think saw that for what it was to, that that was the case.

Speaker 5:          01:56:52       So when you look at the world in terms of threats and, Ooh, imminent danger to the United States, like what could be done to try to lessen that?

Speaker 2:          01:57:01       Well, first and foremost, and this is where the Obama administration has concentrated on, and I couldn't tell you the status of how effective it is a, but it is to cut off funding to terrorism. I mean that's the, that's the, uh, that's the goal. The, Eh, um, Saudi Arabia,

Speaker 5:          01:57:21       terrorism. Such a weird word because it's such a blanket statement. If you're not talking about an individual nation with an individual motive, you know, you say terrorism, it's like we have a war on terror. What does that really mean? You know, I mean, well they talking about

Speaker 2:          01:57:37       in groups and Muslim, the Muslims get extremely offended when you use the term Islamic terrorism or Moose, uh, you know, um, Islamic terrorism, which looking at it from the outside, it does appear as though there is that constant. Um, but, um, Muslims would say that, look, that's not inherent in the Muslim religion, which I more than agree with. Um, so this is the political correctness about saying terrorism as opposed to Islamic terrorists. Right? Right. But the terrorist just happened to be Islamic does seem to be that common element, but is that something that's taught? Um, is that something that most, uh, most of, uh, Muslim religion believes in you? No. No, no, but it does seem to be a common thread. And, um, but that's the political, I'm repeating myself here. I, how do calm that down?

Speaker 5:          01:58:41       I mean, what do you, how do you, is there any way to appease people that are so upset at the United States? I mean, what is their major gripe? What does her major reason for being upset with us? And as a president, what would you do to try to stop that or

Speaker 3:          01:58:55       well, that you would contain it for at a minimum, you'd try and contain it to where it's at and not allow it to spread. And now I'm back to, uh, uh, uh, military policy defense, um, having an impenetrable national defense that the notion of somehow a dirty bomb getting over here into the United States. I mean, that should be a real, a real live concern.

Speaker 5:          01:59:18       Just getting military operatives though they believe that a proactive attack or proactive action is much more likely to stop isis or anything nice or,

Speaker 3:          01:59:30       well, and that's, and that's been our tact to date. And, um, I'm going to say that, uh, without exception that every one of those military interventions have had an unintended consequence of at best, you know, we, we, we, we go, we're, we're, we always deal with atrocity, their atrocities going on. We go in to deal with that atrocity. And at the end of the day, the new dictator, the new desperate that we put into place to replace the bad, desperate at the end of the day is just as bad or in many cases worse. We cut off the head of the Hydra and Lo and behold, they're more heads.

Speaker 5:          02:00:08       So how does one stop that? I mean it, I mean, if you ever tried to come up with some sort of a solution or look at some sort of a long term plan that would somehow or another calm the world, or at least allow the United States to make peace.

Speaker 2:          02:00:22       You know, one of the reasons that I'm seeking to become president of United States is I think I do a really good job of presiding over over all the intelligence that we do have regarding all of this. And I don't want to, I don't want to present myself as having the answers as much as you know, what, give me, give me the Intel, uh, let me be part of this discussion and um, but I'm going to enter into this discussion as a real skeptic, um, on what we've done to this point and a real skeptic on what appears to be, what we're going to do in the future regarding all of this. And isn't there a more effective way of dealing with this? I wouldn't be seeking this job if I'm, if I didn't think that I could make a difference in it and I, I do not want to misstate. I don't want to, I don't want to play cards. Obama draws lines in the sand. I'm not going to draw lines in the sand. If you draw any lines in the sand, you better be prepared to back up what you've said, uh, with action. And that's also been an issue with Obama.

Speaker 5:          02:01:30       How much different do you think perspective changes once you get into office? Once you get into office and you sit down with military leaders and you sit down with someone, explains to you

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       the, the actual landscape you're dealing with.

Speaker 2:          02:01:43       I think he pushed himself too. I think that perspective can change a lot. But how about being transparent? How about saying how bout, how bout being transparent with the American public? How about educating the American public to um, to the Intel that does exist.

Speaker 4:          02:01:59       It's a wooden, they possibly alert the enemy that we have knowledge of. Some things they may or may not know we have knowledge of

Speaker 2:          02:02:04       and that you certain danger, you certainly wouldn't want to cross over that line in any way whatsoever. But uh, if, if you've got elected to office saying that we should not militarily intervene, that military interventions have an unintended consequence and then the next day you militarily intervene somewhere, you better darn well get up in front of the American public and take the, take the eggs and tomatoes or,

Speaker 4:          02:02:30       or worse. What was your take when Obama went on television and was talking about how we needed to invade Syria and Syria was a huge issue. And then the American public was up in arms, both the right and the left people like, what are you talking about? This is craziness. And then the, the administration backed off and we was, to me, my opinion, it was one of the first that was drawing, I'm sorry. Yeah, that's okay. But it was one of the first examples of the United States, like sort of collectively the will of the people like being openly expressed that the idea of entering Syria was outrageous. Nobody wanted to do it. They didn't make any sense to people. This gas attack. Like how is this any more horrible than a lot of shit that's going on all over the world all the time. What is that? What is it about Syria that all of a sudden we have to go and invade Syria? One more intervention in one more country in the United States. Admit the administration backed off.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       Great. Great example. People, people are fed up with this and the fact that, uh, you know, 22 million people in Syria and 11 million of them have been displaced, don't we? Don't we have a share? And in that consequence,

Speaker 4:          02:03:36       well, what was the motivation? What was the motivation for the United States wanted to invade their in the first place?

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       Well, it wasn't it a mccain going over there and beating his chest and, uh, along with, uh, Lindsey Graham and, uh, and let's go over there and support the good guys. Well, the good guys are the minority and the good guys at the end of the day, um, look, this is where the somehow we're going to determine the outcomes, uh, in other countries. I mean, that's just, it's preposterous that, uh, as individuals we can do that.

Speaker 4:          02:04:12       But this seems so contrary to what Obama stood for before he got an office. So when he gets on television and talks about intervening, going over to Syria about, you know, there's gas attacks and all this jazz, like where, where's that motivation coming from? Like, who's behind him pushing him into this direction? Or is this just how he's been the entire time? And we just, he just sold us a song and dance before he got into office.

Speaker 2:          02:04:36       You, you, you off this,

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       this kind of line of thought by saying we're, this is where I thought you were headed was can you get in and not be co opted by the system? Um, based on my ex only experience having been governor of New Mexico. Yeah, you can't, meaning you can go that good government was easy. It wasn't hard that you, that you weren't co-opted. There was plenty of cooption that uh, you know, that tried to wield itself. But you know what? You're the president of the United States. You're the governor of a state. You know, you're, you're at the top of the pyramid. You, yes, you do have limited powers, but even with those limited powers, you're still the most powerful human being on earth. Don't you think? There's a pretty radical difference between being a governor of a state without a military and being the president of the United States dealing not just with the same sort of problems that you dealt with as a governor, but on a much larger scale, plus the problems of the world, plus the military plus the weird stuff like the NSA and the CIA. And the NSA.

Speaker 2:          02:05:40       Yeah. And it has to be extremely more complex. But at the end of the day, do you, can you still tell the truth? Can you still admit mistakes? Um, and you know, if, if you're willing to tell the truth and you're willing to admit mistakes, mistakes seemed to have a way of compounding themselves when you don't admit the mistakes as in lieu of admitting the mistakes and then taking corrective action. But really at the end of the day, doesn't it boil down to telling the truth and um, and fessing up to mistakes and fixing it?

Speaker 5:          02:06:14       I would think so. But it seems to me that the, the wiring of the office is so complex and there's so much craziness going on that no one gets in office and does what they said they were going to do before they got an office because I'm almost seem insurmountable. That was not my experience. That was not mine. As a governor, governors have done what they've, they've pledged.

Speaker 2:          02:06:39       Well. So would you rather, would you rather elect someone who has had the experience of not having been co-opted, uh, as opposed to somebody who has been cooptive want one wants someone that's been cooptive at the end of the day. Will I be, would I, if I'm elected president United States at the end of the day, would I be able to make that same statement? I hope so. So

Speaker 5:          02:07:05       that's the best way to put it. That's an honest way to put it. You hope so. Cause it just, I, I really would like to know. I would love it if you became president and we could stay friends and I could go, hey man, I won't tell anybody. No, no. We'll tell. We'll tell the world, tell them on back here. We'll tell the world I don't want to get shot with you. I'm to run away. I just, it's just the whole thing seems so almost impossibly intertwined that it's like a, you go fishing.

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       You ever go fishing?

Speaker 3:          02:07:37       No, I'm, I'm on my mountain bike as opposed to fishing. I do have a, just a sidelight. I do have a stream running through my, uh, right by my house. I have 1600 feet of frontage on the Hondo River and it's loaded with taxpayer trout. So give me, give you an invitation to come. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:07:54       Beautiful Stream. That would be like probably fly fishing, right? Um, what I'm talking about is, um, there's a thing called the bird's nest with a business is when you use a bait casting reel and the line spools quicker than it can roll over it and it gets it, it becomes this gigantic tangle. And when you, when you use a bait casting really supposed to sort of regulate it, at least the old school ones, you regulate the amount of pressure with your thumb as to like, uh, how fast the, the wheel turns. The wheel turns too quick. That line gets so tangled and it almost becomes impossible. You look at it and you go, shit, what am I going to do with it? There's, there's a perfect image. That's what a bird's nest looks like. You see how all the line is all just deal with it.

Speaker 4:          02:08:36       Good. Try getting through that. That's a mess. See when I think of the government, I think of like that with bullets that like, this is almost like the analogy branches and it's almost like it's so tangled and with all the other variables that you discussed, terms, term limitations that are, that aren't in place, um, ideological blockades on the left and the right supporting your constituents on the left and the right special interest groups, lobbyists, the fact that there's, I mean there's this one area outside of Washington dc that is just all lobbyists, this, these neighborhoods and it's one of the wealthiest parts of the area and it's just because people are making insane amounts of money manipulating the system.

Speaker 3:          02:09:22       So, uh, I am advocating eliminating income tax and corporate tax and as a result of that, wait a minute,

Speaker 4:          02:09:30       hit the brakes. Did you just say you were talking about lobbyists? Yeah, yeah. How are you going to do that?

Speaker 3:          02:09:41       Eliminate income tax. Eliminate corporate tax because you're going to do that. You're going to also be able to abolish the irs and you can read, Oh, you just hear me out here. Just a radical boulevard. You hear me out a couple more minutes and we would replace all of that with one federal consumption tax. Now how do you do that? While there's an actual proposal out there, it's called the fair tax. Uh, and it's uh, how you dot the i's and cross the t's when it comes to establishing one federal consumption tax. If we had zero corporate tax in this country, I believe tens of millions of jobs would get created if we did not have corporate tax. If we did not have income tax, I believe that pink slips would get issued to 80 of Washington

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       lobbyists because that's why they're there to garner special tax favor. At the end of the day, it's all about, uh, advantage and really that amounts to tax money spent. So how does this consumption tax work and how would you possibly implement and how would you possibly get anyone to agree to do this? To get rid of the irs, to get rid of the, yeah, actually come to a couple hundred, a couple hundred congressmen and women, maybe 160 have actually signed on to this proposal. So this proposal's been around for quite a while. And how many oppose it? Well, you got what, how many? 400 f well by pose, not necessarily opposed, but you know, you haven't signed on, haven't signed on. Well that would be more than half have not signed on, but a significant number have. So it's uh, it's been vetted. It's, it's out there. Okay. So this consumption tax, yeah. How does this work?

Speaker 1:          02:11:31       It would be a 28% consumption, tossed the board on, on all new goods and services, not used goods and services. And before you fall off the chair, the theory, the theory is that it wouldn't necessarily, it would be cost neutral. So if I could use a can of coke as an example, can of coke that sells for a buck today, um, has a corporate tax contained in that book. It has unemployment, a contained in that book. It has social security match contained in that book. It has medicare a contained in that dollar. It has the accounting fees and the legal fees that go along with complying with the irs and the filing with the irs. So arguably the can of coke would not sell for a buck. It would sell for 73 cents and then the 28% tax would get applied to the can of coke.

Speaker 1:          02:12:23       So you'd still end up paying a buck for the can of coke. That's the theory. So by doing this and eliminating income tax, how much different would the amount be that the government receives? This is intended to be revenue neutral, revenue neutral. So governments still gonna receive the same amount of money. That's the, that's also the projection that how's that possible? The people are not paying income tax. I say if someone's wealthy filling out $1 million a year and you know $1 million a year, you're probably in a 48% tax bracket. Take away all your tax shelters and all the various ways, corporations, llcs, all that jazz. You're, you're in the 30s probably, right? That's a lot of money. That's $300,000 so how much money are you? How are you going to welding that? Well that if you're making a lot of money, you spend a lot of money, so you're going to pay that money and consumption tax, scrooge mcduck and you just hanging back. Whoa. Then that's a way that you can, uh, isn't there a fairness in that? But the reality is the more people make when it comes to money, the more people spend. But if you want to save your money, when you say new and used, does that apply to homes? Yup. So a new home, you would have to pay 38% that would want to uphold the whole market, 28% that would cripple the home market because no one would want to buy a new home.

Speaker 2:          02:13:42       No, but I'm back to back to the theory. The right now you've got the, when you, when you enlist the aid of the plumbing company, the plumbing company has, so first of all, no more payroll deductions. Um, the social security, uh, unemployment, um, medicare, all of that would come out of the proceeds of one federal consumption tax. So all government proceeds would come from this new pot of money. So it's just a sales tax. So instead of the plumber on your home, uh, giving you a $100,000 bill for the plumbing, uh, theoretically the bill will be 73 grand with me. So it's not the, the, the, the theory is the house really isn't going to cost you any more. Um, uh, because, uh, all these hidden taxes that exist are going to go away.

Speaker 1:          02:14:40       Hmm. That sounds cute. It's theory. Well,

Speaker 2:          02:14:44       and let me, let me also just say, uh, I'm looking to get elected president of the United States. Um, I'm going to sign on to what I think is going to make anything better. But when you talk about making things really better, I think this is a proposal that simplifies all of our lives in a, in a huge way. Imagine not having to

Speaker 1:          02:15:06       deal with the irs. It would be tremendous, but you would also put all those people out of jobs and they're going to fight for that. They're going to, they're going to charge it against that. That'd be a job. That would be

Speaker 2:          02:15:17       the accounting and the, and the, uh, uh, attorney fees that go along with complying with the irs and the irs employees themselves.

Speaker 1:          02:15:25       And if you think about the pressure that the police unions or the, the guard unions rather prison guard unions put to make sure that marijuana is still remains illegal and drug laws remained in place, imagine the kind of pressure that lobbyists and the irs and anyone else that might be affected by these decisions are going to put to try to stop this from happening. Well, this is, this though would be a dialogue if you had a, in this case, Gary Johnson onstage in the presidential debates talking about something like this. Um, wouldn't, that I'm maybe open people's eyes to the fact that Whoa, life could change dramatically. Some would argue for the better. I think at the end of the day you would, you can argue that this would make life a lot better for everybody. Um, we'll certainly stimulate a dialogue, but I wonder if you can get that point across and those little soundbites it do in those debates. I think so.

Speaker 2:          02:16:20       Um, tens of millions of jobs would get created overnight here in the United States because of a zero tax rate.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       Why? So why would you, why would you create a job anywhere in the world other than the United States given zero corporate taxes? So you think that like apple would move, their iphone factors are paying people 5 cents an hour. They'd move into the United States and have to pay a working wage because they don't have to pay corporate taxes. Wouldn't they cancel each other out? Wouldn't it be more profitable to still invoke foreign labor and use third world countries, but they would have to pay that corporate tax in that foreign country? I mean, right, but it's minimal, right? I mean, no, it's not me. It's not minimal, but it's less so now. But now I'm back to, hey, I get elected president of United States and I'm sue and I get legislation submitted to reduce corporate tax. Yeah, I'm going to sign on to that because I think it really is a hindrance to job creation when we have the highest corporate tax rate.

Speaker 1:          02:17:19       But imagine instead of having a debate over, should we reduce the corporate tax rate to 28% or 29% and Republicans and Democrats both get their peacock feathers all up in arms, about 29 or 28 or 27 well, how about zero? How about doing away with the irs? Oh my gosh. Imagine the, I mean if, if, if lowering it is good. How about eliminating it? Well, I think you would get universal support from the United States. I mean from people in the country. If you ask people how much do they love the United States irs system, they would say zero. I mean, I don't think there's a single person other than people who work for the irs and says, I love them. They're awesome. I love when they go after your bank account. I love when they take all your money. Yeah, no, you're right. You're right. No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:18:06       I, I'll drop the, I'll drop the thought completely because of the love that does exist for the irs. You're right. No what I'm saying, no one loves, no, no, don't know what I'm saying. I do mean everyone hates it. So everyone wouldn't hate you would get a hundred percent support. Well, no, there's nothing. There's no such thing as a hundred percent, but obviously, but how about the how, how about, you know, how about this entering into the, uh, the debate? Yeah. What would be a great thing to talk about? Because the system is not good and no one thinks it is. So the idea of keeping it exactly the way it is seems pretty ridiculous, right? I mean, that's like the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. It's crony capitalism. It's, you know, those that have money pay less of their share.

Speaker 1:          02:18:53       Um, this really at the, at the end of the day is very fair. Right. So thinking of that, and along those lines, how do you feel about corporations donating to political candidates? I have no issue with corporations donating to political candidates. But the problem today is, are these super pacs that are 100% nontransparent. You have no idea who's contributing to these superpacs make, make for unlimited contribution. Just make the contributions hundred percent transparent. I'm the one that said candidate should wear, um, nascar like jackets with that was Robin Williams. Actually, I actually, that was me. Maybe. Maybe he got it from me. He used to do a hit a bit about it on hbo show. He didn't go to sleep with the TV on. No, I think I had this first. I think I do have this first. Tell me what the year was. Let's do google it. Well, uh, yeah, no deal.

Speaker 1:          02:19:52       Google it. You know, it's Robin Williams ripped you off. That would be brutal. No, I'm not. There's no rip off. You might have, but this would have been, I had been saying this in 2009. I think he might've got ya. Well maybe so, but, but, but I'm not, I'm not infringing on his stuff. I thought it was original. I want to think of special was in 2006. I want to think, I wonder if you might be parallel thinking it doesn't mean yes, that's the problem with intellectual property is a weight look. If it's parallel thinking, certainly I'm not the only other one either. I mean, I'm sure there are probably a hundred people listening right now that are going, no, I said that first 100%. Well, it's a pretty obvious connection, right? You see Nascar, they're all covered with logos. It stands out and you know who's sponsoring or the logo.

Speaker 1:          02:20:43       The more money, the more money was controlling the direct. I mean this, the, the, the direct comparison because they're the most obvious sponsor thing. The car sponsored, their jackets are sponsored, everything's covered in logos. They're like, if you look at basketball players, you don't see that, you know, it's very rare that you see any sort of a sporting event where they're covered with logos like that. So what, what year that's coming this next season, what the NBA is adding all those logos to all their things. I'm writing one. Yeah, they're earning one logo. And this is a way was actually argued against the reebok deal for the UFC. Um, I, I, I get real concerned with a superpacs for sure. I get real concerned with money and politics and that is a, I think one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders has stood out. It's cause he's the only guy that is not really accepting money from these giant corporations and he's fairly self funded.

Speaker 1:          02:21:37       One of them. One of the misconceptions about a campaign finances is that one of the misconceptions is that if you limit campaign contribution that um, that things are going to get better and you're going to eliminate the influence of big money when the reality is by limiting campaign contribution. You basically, that's an incumbency protection act. So limiting campaign contribution is all about reelecting incumbents. That's what it's all about. Look, if you, if you could get, if somebody would finance me to the tune of $1 billion, they might change this country in a really big way. Should the billion dollars be anonymous? I don't think so. I think that it should be front and center and whom ever contributed. That should be known

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       completely. And that a, their goal was to change America and by giving Gary Johnson a billion bucks, um, I have the opportunity to do that, that it just be transparent as opposed to having to take 500,000 contributions at $2,000. Um, which has, which has, which at the end of the day has more of a corrupting influence,

Speaker 5:          02:22:53       more of a corrupting influence and one super rich person that wants to influence your decision making.

Speaker 2:          02:22:58       Well, uh, as an example, governor of New Mexico, my number one contributor of for two for two terms, uh, gave me $150,000. May sound cheap too. A lot of people,

Speaker 5:          02:23:09       but that doesn't sound cheap. It sounds like a guy with a lot of money you can throw 150 grand your way. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:23:14       Eh, and Eh, over an eight year old girl over an eight year period. Um, he was, he was never, not once did he call for anything. There was never any requests. That's about rare though. No. Well, maybe, but my point is, is it, if I would have had a thousand contributors, uh, giving me 150. Right, I see what you're saying. $1,500 get a hundred people giving me $1,500. I guarantee a Joe that 10 of them at some point would have been on the phone

Speaker 5:          02:23:51       wanting something. Right. Guarantee it. Uh, okay. I, this is, um, it's pretty anecdotal. Don't know. I mean, you're talking about one contributor versus if you're looking at someone who's, or who's trying to contribute though to the United States, to someone running for the United States and if they give you $1 billion, one person who gives you $1 billion, that guy's going to want some, he's gonna want something. I don't think, I really don't think it's that.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       So let's, let's, let's use a more realistic term. A billionaire that wants a, you know, a multibillionaire that wants to give $10 million bill gates or someone like someone like that. Yeah. Is it, is it, is it, is it inconceivable that there is that there aren't a whole bunch of those people out there that would just be looking for good government and just be looking to back that the candidate of their choice based on what it was they were saying? Not On, not on. I don't think it's inconceivable at all, but just let's all know who that contributor was and how much money.

Speaker 5:          02:24:51       Well, I understand that the transparency aspect, that sort of makes sense. But boy, having one person that influences politics that much, it's concerning. It concerns people. And I think rightly so, because someone who has that much money, who they are, they're already in this very strong, advantageous position. And the only reason why you would rationally give someone $1 billion is if you thought that it was going to be an advantage to you. You are going to somehow or another reap the rewards of giving them that money. Good government. So, um,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       in my, I'd never been involved in politics before, running for governor of New Mexico. Never knew businessman, successful, but never, never even pounded in a campaign sign. Well, how did I get elected? Well, I paid for my own campaign. Uh, my primary, this is gonna sound really cheap, but my primary, the first time was $540,000. 510 of it was mine and 30 and motivation, just good government. The note it, the notion of life and what do you do with your life? And for me, my entire life, um, politics, um, I, I viewed it as a high calling. You know, the notion of being in a position to make things better. Now, look, I'm the first person to also admit that if you had people lined up, or if you ask, asked how many, how many are going to line up here to say Gary Johnson was a scourge of the earth.

Speaker 2:          02:26:16       Hey, you know, there'd be, there'd be lines blocks long out out here. I get it. I get it. But you try and do their main criticism be no. Um, I don't think, I don't think you'd actually have that happen, but there's always criticism regardless of what you do. And the motivation for what I've done always is to make things better. But there are always people that, um, have something contrary to say, no matter what. I mean, you could write an article about soccer and you're going to have 100 people, man. Well, so I didn't have to go out and raise any money. I, I gave him the money to myself. Well, why can't you extend that argument and say that if somebody would've given me, if one person would have given me that same $510,000, that that person wouldn't have changed the uh, uh, okay. My contributor that gave me 150 grand for good government. Well he, he had the ability to write, you know, he had the ability to give 510 grand and, and essentially get me elected. Wouldn't

Speaker 5:          02:27:18       been. Isn't that a good thing? Well, it's only a good thing if it's a good guy, but we don't know that it's a good guy. We just know it's a rich guy. And the amount of influence of that one rich person has is very problematic to regular pan should be part of the equation on the analysis of is this having an impact and who is it and how much money have they given, which currently, um, these super pacs, 100% non transparent. Right? But do you think the transparency protects you from influence? Like if it is transparent and you have like one of the Koch brothers, it's given all the money up. You, even if it's transparent, you know what the hell their motivation is. They want to continue to extract massive amounts of money. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:27:57       Well, if, if it's one person that's giving all the money, then there's that much more scrutiny that goes along with that person giving that much more money. And um, and you, you'd have to think, uh, that, uh, the influence wouldn't be as blatant as it was if it was completely nontransparent.

Speaker 5:          02:28:15       Yeah, I'm a little skeptical. I'm also right. That's okay. Wait, what did you think when the Supreme Court, the decision to allow

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       corporations to donate as if they were individuals? It doesn't make much sense to me. No, it doesn't make much sense. What do you think the motivation was for that though? Why would they pass something like that? You know, I am too far in the weeds, but they did it and it just doesn't make any sense. It's kind of creepy though, isn't it? A little, yeah, I think so. I like what you're saying. I really liked this idea of abolishing the irs a consumption tax. I love the Iga of the fair tax, check out the fair tax and, and there are no fair taxes, but like I say, dot the i's and cross the t's on how you accomplish one federal consumption tax. To wrap this up, I'm just going to give you the floor. Just sell it, sell it to the American people. What is wrong, what can be fixed and what can Gary Johnson do to fix it? I

Speaker 3:          02:29:08       want to make a pitch for myself and that is, is that I think I really am a unique package. Uh, I am fiscally conservative. Um, I'm, I'm as frugal a human being as you've ever met, but that doesn't mean that I'm cheap. It just means that I spend my money wisely. I got to serve as governor of New Mexico for two terms. Uh, I served as governor of New Mexico for two terms as a Republican in the state that's two to one democrat. I got reelected by a bigger margin the second time than the first time. Made a name for myself as a real government skeptic vetoing legislation. I may have vetoed more legislation than the other 49 governors in the country combined. Coupled with that, um, I'm socially tolerant. I'm socially liberal. Look, you and I should be able to make decisions in our own lives that only affect our own lives as long as those decisions don't adversely affect others.

Speaker 3:          02:30:07       And then there is a very real terrorist threat out there. It exists. Um, but I do believe that our military interventions have resulted in making situations worse, not better. So I'm a real skeptic when it comes to government and the fact that government is too big. Uh, I've been an entrepreneur my entire life. I know what it is to a hire and fire. I know what it is to share in the profits. And what a magic formula that is that when you share in the profits, amazingly the profit pie grows significantly. Uh, I've been an athlete my entire life. Bit of an oxymoron is a 63 year old, but what athletics has taught me is, you know, life is putting one foot in front of the other. Athletics has taught me that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. It's how you deal with failure that ultimately determines your success. Look, things go wrong all the time. You can crawl up on the couch, uh, you can declare yourself a victim. You can give up, or you can recognize that that's just part of life and wake up the next day with a smile on your face and continue to move forward and just do your

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       best. I've told, I've told the truth. Uh, I think it's really hard to do any damage to somebody who's willing to tell the truth, regardless of the consequences. And then I admit mistakes. I think mistakes have a way of, so compounding themselves just because people don't acknowledge those mistakes. So given this pitch, all I want to do is just get in, uh, the polls that determines who is in the presidential debates. I think that if I'm in the presidential debates, I have an opportunity of actually winning because of this package that you've allowed me to present here today. Oh, thank you.

Speaker 4:          02:32:01       Well, I appreciate you coming on, sir. I really do. It was a very enjoyable talking to you. And, uh, I hope you win, man. I really do. I hope you, I hope you at least at the very least, make enough headway to get people paying attention to you and to get into the Poles and just to listen to your message.

Speaker 2:          02:32:19       And if I'm in the presidential debates, that means I'm representing 25 million people. So what comes out of my mouth if I don't end up getting more votes than the other two candidates, the one that does, you know what? They're not blind to the fact that, Whoa, this guy's sitting over here. He's representing 25 million people because he's in the debates. So we better pick up a little bit on what he has to say, cause they're going to see some sense in it also. Anyway, thank you,

Speaker 4:          02:32:44       Gary Johnson. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, sir. I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 6:          02:33:03       Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:33:06       Yeah.
