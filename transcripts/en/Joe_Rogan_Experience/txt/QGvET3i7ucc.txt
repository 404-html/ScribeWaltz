Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five four, three, two, one. Fuck it. We'll do it live.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Fuck it. We'll do it. We'll do it live.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Josh [inaudible]. Today's a sad day in las bill o'reilly. Oh, am morning at you. Morning Joe. I feel like I should be, but I'm not a ton of loot. What's that? I said he made a ton of lewd. Wow. I mean since 96 when Fox News launched and he was like the big, I'm just making it up, but that's when Fox News launch. Let's check at Jamie, is that when Fox News launched 96

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       uh, he has pulled in so much money for that network and for himself. He was one of the bunch of bulls. The main guy, he really was the main guy in broadcasting. They're going to find another old cut to fill a spot. You're going to have to, that's what people look at. That October 7th, 1996, ladies and gentlemen, you'll welcome America. You'll wear that. He was on like a hard copy or something like that. Right. I don't even know. I was too young. I wasn't even here in the states. Oh yeah, I was at school, child in Australia and was a child. I don't remember him from anything else. I just remember him being on o'reilly and watching it and going, what is it? It's like that longing for in the Stall Gia thing, you know, you see an older gentleman in a tie who just sit well and that's the way it is.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       The tide goes in, the tide goes out, can you define it? What in the fuck is this guy doing? And that was when he was talking, he was talking to an atheist, wasn't it? Who was he? Was it? Oh, I don't remember. It was like maybe it was ricky Gervais' or some, I can't remember, but he was saying, well maybe it was sam. Could it have been Sam Harris? I don't know who it was somewhat. Some atheist was saying like a w was saying, what do you, he was like, Bill was like, I've got the absolute number one reason why you have to believe in God because tide goes in. Tide goes out, always been that way. Always will be that way when one goes round or just spins around. How do you explain that? If not God, it was just super obvious that he was pandering because the guy went to fucking Harvard.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Okay. Bill O'reilly's not a dope. He might be a Douche bag, but he's not a dope. He's not. I think religion makes people dopey and ways that they don't and they don't even know about, I don't even think he's religious. I think he's barely religious. I think he's religious enough to get by with the job. I said, do you think he's in since he has been in some see 100% because I think he's one of the, look, I don't watch the show a lot, so I'm not sure. But I, he's always struck me as one of the more straight shooters. I think he is. He's smart but not wise. Yes. Uh, you know, he feels what he feels in his gut is more important than what the data tells him. And I think he falls for a bunch of fallacies that a lot of people fall for, especially if they're religious. Like the idea that there was a certain order to the cosmos and how could we all have come about? How could this whole thing around us exist with all these butterflies and the moon and the tide comes in and the tide goes out and does his, me and Joe, these spiritual creatures, these beings sitting opposite each other on a, at a table

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       in Los Angeles right now. Some people just find that to inexplicably to explain without a deity, so they're like, all right, there must've been a big guy who did it.

Speaker 4:          00:03:09       It's even dumber in my opinion, to think that one dude engineered this whole fucking thing. I mean, wouldn't, wouldn't you just think that, oh wow. There's some crazy super complex system that sort of works in some odd way where it balances itself out with Predator and prey and food and water and fire and dirt and all this stuff together, and then you realize that it all has to form out of the the, the, the actual elements that come from an exploding star. It's magnificent. Just the actual, this, the full realm of things that they've absolutely proven to be true in terms of like scientific discoveries about the universe and the, yeah, just the very elements that constitute human beings and everything. You see this table and laptops, it's amazing the idea that one dude and sitting there up in his class

Speaker 3:          00:04:00       and of course moderate religious people will say, well, of course we don't believe in that kind of a god. We don't believe in a God with a robe and a beard sitting in the clouds. We believe in a more sophisticated metaphorical version of God. Yeah, but you still believe that whatever consciousness created black holes and the whole cosmos gives a shit whether or not you beat off well also that it has to be a one. Yeah. Hey God, a thin one thing, unless you're a Hindu, in which case I've got an elephant got over here, I've got to emission whoever. Here I've got a multi armed monkey and you got a lot of Hash Hash to say those things. I mean, one of the things that's interesting is I think at any given point in time, people just assumed that the universe was created by whatever thing happens to be around them. It was on the podcast head that that was a great upset. I had him on my podcast with, uh, no, I had him on point of inquiry actually, which is a different podcast than my normal one where the people, like the week before he was on yours, yours was way better. You can talk about a lot of shit in three hours. Joe, you kind of took that theme and that's why I like doing it. Yeah. Broke

Speaker 4:          00:05:09       my brain with this one thing he said. He explained that when you talk about the universe being 14 billion years old, you're talking about the observable universe and he's like, the problem is space moves faster than light. The universe is moving faster than the speed of light. So what we're seeing is what we can see from 14 billion years ago because, but that doesn't mean that's all there is, right. He goes, space itself is bending. But what he's saying is space itself beyond that could be infinite. It's just moving faster than we can see. He just spread my brain. Yeah, exactly. So, but he was saying, it's like when you're talking about the observable universe being, I think it's 13.7 billion years, almost 14 billion years old. That's just how far back we can see. He's like, but before that, like when you go back further. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 4:          00:06:03       It's just that we can't see it because the space itself is moving faster than the speed of light. That's right. And you're also, what you're looking at is not only the edge of the universe, but the edge of time. Yeah. Because it's not even the edge. What he's saying is it's, it's very likely that not only is it infinite, but there's an infinite number of possibilities beyond it. Yes. And those things beyond it may also be right alongside us. I mean, in terms of the other dimensions and things like that, like he didn't even get into all of it, all of that stuff. But if you believe in string theory and quantum physics and if you believe in math, then you sort of have to, well quantum physics and string theory to a dope like me is one of those things where I have to contact your word for it.

Speaker 4:          00:06:44       It's almost like before the, uh, before the Lutheran Times, before the Bible was translated and you have to rely on the priest, just trust the price. I'll just you and your knowledge cause he knows Latin and he speaks Aramaic. You know it's going to read this shit. Yeah. Who told the priest? Well the pope who told the Pope don't ask questions, but when you go into this food, that's why it's so important to, to appreciate like when people are science deniers, it's so frustrating because everything you use, everything you enjoy, everything that you in terms of medicine, technology is based on the work of countless people who have worked generations after generations on the innovations of the past. Like the people before them invented some shit. They improved upon it. They figured out more. They studied the calculations of those people, they added to it. And then you get to 2017 so whenever someone steps in with an incredibly limited understanding of science or of what we're, what we're dealing with in terms of the universe itself and says, Whoa, tide goes in, the tide goes out.

Speaker 4:          00:07:45       You can't explain it like you mother fucker. They've been explaining the tides forever. What are you talking about you? I think what he actually means is Yukon. Explain why there is. Why there is something instead of total chaos and anarchy. I think you can get sold credit. He's a douchebag. He's, I think he's pandering. I think he was just trying to, I think he knows there's a bunch of old dummies out there, crocheting, you know, with three teeth listening to his stupid fucking shit. I don't think that you can be highly intelligent and religious. Yes you can, but you highly effective at individual pursuits. Now when you talk, when you say highly intelligent, as soon as soon as someone is religious in terms of like if you believe in preposterous notions, like there's a guy who came back to life, he turns water into wine, he walks on water. If you believe that you're not intelligent, you're just not well, I don't believe you're intelligent. I think you are intelligent in individual disciplines, but obviously if you believe something that makes no sense whatsoever, you believe that someone was magic. Someone defied physics. Someone had superpowers. Someone was a person who could bring people back to life. Someone could come back to life themselves.

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       There's no evidence. You believe this on the flimsiest fucking evidence that wasn't even written down until 70 or 80 years after that dude died because Christianity didn't even so been worse than that because the old testament is far older than totally notion of Jesus, but that's not it. Hang on, I, I do quibble with the idea that this, that you can't be smart. Stephen Colbert was one of the smartest, the word smart. This is what the problem is like would define smart, what you believe. Stupid Shit. Are you smart? You are implying that the reason why bill o'reilly talks about tide goes in tide goes out is because he's pandering to people because he's, he's a Harvard guy and there's no way that he would be dumb enough to believe that no, I'm, I'm, I'm complying that because I looked at the way he said it and I know what he does and I think he's manipulative and I think what he's doing is playing to his base.

Speaker 5:          00:09:47       I think there's a lot of people out there that want to see some smug liberal atheist get taken down a notch and bill just the guy to do it and talk over him and he's a big giant guys. You can yell and get all aggressive. We went on, I don't understand is like steven called Bay is obviously a very smart guy. He's a Catholic. Andrew Sullivan. I know if you know him, the blogger a, he's a friend of Sam Harris's like he's a Christian and good luck. These people find ways of compartmentalizing logic I guess. So like as you say, they believe in something that is totally crazy. I mean the idea that you can say a certain number of Latin words over a over a cracker and it'll turn bodily into the flesh of someone who existed 2000 years ago. It's crazy magic talk. Well, it's crazy talk, but there are people that are religious that are extremely intelligent and I agree with you on this.

Speaker 5:          00:10:33       Like Jordan Peterson, who's a brilliant man who is very religious in the sense that he studies religion and he believes there's some fundamental principles that are involved in religion that are in extra bowl to the human condition. And I think he think he thinks they're important to our society and to civility and ethics and morals. I don't think he believes people walked on water. I don't think he believed someone came back from the dead. I don't think he believes this stupid shit and I don't think the stupid shit is even the original story. The huge problem with religion is translation over time. That's one of the biggest problems. The oldest version of the Bible that we know of is the Dead Sea Scrolls. They don't even use that because it's so fucking crazy. If you listen to some of the translations of the Dead Sea Scrolls, are you read? Some of it is unbelievably crazy. I mean it sounds like science fiction stuff. And if you go back to that version of it, I mean you're talking about stuff that was written on animal skins. They used to do they, they, they did DNA tests to make sure that the pieces that they got, you don't, you know the whole story behind the Dead Sea scrolls basically, but you found them in Cobra on the scrolls were written on animal skin. So the, they were broken up. So the piece them back together, they had to do DNA testing to make sure that the piece

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       of skin came from the same cow. And then they had to try to figure out, okay, where does all this shit go? And then how to, how to put it into place. But they don't even use that version of the Bible. And even if you use the Old Testament, people say, well that's the Old Testament. We don't really, we go by the New Testament, which is even more preposterous because the new testament was written by Constantine and a bunch of bishops and men decided what to leave in and what to take out. They decided

Speaker 1:          00:12:18       of course, and that the whole chunks of it a contradictory as true as well as the Bible,

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       but I mean we're just talking about the bio for now. Constantine wasn't even religious. I mean Constantine wasn't even a Christian until he died. He was converted on his fucking death bed. I mean he just did it so that he could unite Rome. He knew what the fuck he was doing. He was getting all these people to operate together. Does this mean there's No God, absolutely not. Does this mean that I have in the answers that you don't have? Of course not. I'm just saying people are full of Shit and that story sucks.

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       It's that simple. Why they may. I think what we do too much of is confusing. Two questions, one of which is, is there a god without defining what God is and the other of which is, is there any reason to believe in a particular faith or a particular denomination to be a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or whatever

Speaker 4:          00:13:06       done in further than that people don't know. And anyone who says they know that's not telling the truth. Yeah. We're not talking about, well, we do know that carbon comes from stars when they explode. Yeah. Well that can be scientifically explained and proven. We're not talking about that. We're talking about, do you know whether or not Jesus was a man who came back from the dead and turn water into what you do not know? One

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       it is. I know with as much certainty that he didn't do that. I don't know anything about the past. But you don't hear. You honestly don't. You don't. Well, how do, how do you know what Napoleon did? You don't write well, we know historical records. We know the stories of people from back then, but the idea that

Speaker 4:          00:13:48       this one guy did things that no human being could ever do today. Yeah. Defied logic, physics, the laws of nature, the laws of life and death, all the different reality. The reality is that we accept today in terms of what's provable, what we know about biological life. All that stuff was violated by this one guy. Yup.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Could have happened. They could have, it could have in the same way. I'm like close might not have happened. No. It's way less likely than that. You reckon it's more likely that Jesus was divine? No. The opposite. It's way more likely to called the Holocaust didn't happen then that Jesus did all of that shit and I think the Holocaust is 100% real. He sounds like me too. I mean that's, that's kind of my point. There is a religious people put an undue burden on on nonreligious people by saying, look, who's to say? I say there's a God. You say there's not a god, it's a 50 50 toss up. I'm just going to believe in Christian. I've heard call bear say this to Bill Maher on his show. Look, I'm a Christian. I've got nothing to lose. If I turn out to be right

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and Christianity is true, whoop de do I get to go to heaven? If I, if it turns out that Christianity is wrong, then I just die. But at least you know, give it a chance. This is Pascal's wager, right? This is this idea that you might as well be religious because hey, if it's true, you've got an attorney of goodness, but here's the thing and you avoid hell fire. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:15:11       Can't be true because no one knows like no one has died and giving you the debt. No one's died with a VCR or you know, a vhs tape recorder and comeback with a knock here, put this in the machine and play it. This is heaven. I've shown you,

Speaker 3:          00:15:25       but it's not even a 50 50 shot is what I'm saying. It's not like black. Bertrand Russell kind of demolished this idea with his teapot analogy where he said like, okay, I'm going to claim that there's a teapot circling in orbit between the Earth and the moon, and now if you deny that, then hey, it's just a 50 50 shot. Maybe it's there. Maybe it's not there. Who's to say, obviously you would say, no, I think it's not there because if there's no evidence that it's there, I'm not going to just going to believe you because you say it. And similarly if you say, oh, this guy, Jesus, 2000 years ago, he turned water into wine. He walked on water and then he was the son of God and that God requires you to believe on him. Otherwise you're going to go to hell forever and you say, why should I believe that? And they can't turn around and say, hey, it's a 50 50 shot. It's not a 50 50 shot. There are good reasons for believing things and bad reasons for believing things and religion almost always only offered bad reasons for believing in it.

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       Well, as soon as you start talking numbers, percentages and stuff, like you're just making those numbers up, right? 50 50 where are you coming up with that? How about a 50 50 shot? This is vegas odds. Like what is this little group? A lot of religious people. It doesn't mean, here's the thing. If people are listening to your getting fucking pissed, it doesn't mean there's not a higher power. It doesn't mean it's not an order to this university signs that it's super likely that if there is something that's unbelievably powerful and there's some law that keeps the universe together and some force of good that's trying to guide us in this. There's some, you know there's some beautiful inclinations towards that direction. What I'm saying is I guarantee you that the people who lived 2000 years ago who wrote this shit down on leather with you know, ink that they met at a plant, they didn't have all the data.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       They just didn't know. They just didn't, they didn't know July theory of disease. I mean they didn't even know that the Earth's spinning around the sun. He showed the people who understood the most about the cosmos or some shit today. I mean the reason why they didn't want any pork is because they figured out trick analysis. They're like, oh listen, if you need these fucking pigs, ma'am, kimber getting sick left and really got to stop doing that. As for those things that crawl off on the bottom of the ocean. Yeah. Give me any of that shit. Exactly. Well the got hooked up with red tide. They're like, look, yeah, we're dying. We've got to stop eating shell fish. And there's a lot of like real logic to the Wa the the reasons why they had laws and it makes, makes sense. But the real issue again is the translation. It was that the ancient Hebrew

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       version of the Bible, ancient Hebrew, the words also double as numbers. Like do you know that letters or numbers in ancient Hebrew, right. Their alphabet, they don't have numbers. So the letter a is also the number one. So words have numerical value, like the word God and the word love, they have the same numerical value. All that was lost in translation when you translated to Latin, Greek, eventually English, all that Shit was lost. Like it's the, the ancient Hebrew version of it. Like if you ever read like some really goofy translation of English, Japanese. Yeah. And you're like, what in the fuck are they saying? Or if you translated English into a foreign language and then translate it back from that foreign language into English, if it comes jibberish. Well, one of the things I love about instagram is it has a translation thing that I use a lot of times that follow out of Russian fighters.

Speaker 5:          00:18:40       There's a lot of a Russian MMA fighters and I follow their pages and I'll go, okay, let's hit the translate and now hit translate. I'm like, Jesus, it seems especially hard for some reason. It's got to lead. We had pronouns and things are always saying good. This is the best fight. The well, it's also like their language looks different. Yeah, no, it's totally in cyrillic. If you had the, uh, the claim that the 72 virgins in the Koran or actually 72 raisins, no, but you know what? That wood is almost the same between reason and virgin. No, the expression 72 is like a fuck load. That's what it means. It doesn't mean 72 virgins, but it means like there'll be 72 and you're like, wow, that's, that's enough. That's enough. We're good. I would not need more than 72 virgins or raisins. It's to help me happy bringing them to life.

Speaker 5:          00:19:28       It's probably not even the number 72 it's just like our translation from Arabic to English to screws it up and then someone probably came up with this numerical value a long time ago and they stuck with 72 so I believe in science, paypal. So talking about bill o'reilly, do you think he should have been fired? I don't know what he did and I know I don't know what he didn't do. You know? I don't know. I know he's definitely done some gross shit in the past. Like there's the audio of him calling that check and say he's going to take a loofa sponge Loofah, big, big olive bill with his luther in the shower. I don't know. You know, who knows? I would imagine whenever you hear a story about a guy like that, that's, some of it is probably fabricated. I know. I just don't imagine that all the people that say things about him or all telling the 100% truth, I wouldn't matter.

Speaker 5:          00:20:16       Imagine that would be true because people are just not like, once it gets beyond a few paypal, then you think that the preponderance of evidence is that they're probably, yeah, I guess you can't say they're all telling the truth, but it's hard to take their word for it. No, you don't. You definitely don't. If they're a six, seven, eight people, definitely stories. You definitely have to go. Hmm. But you don't have to take all their word for it because first of all, you don't know those people. You'd have to know those people. You'd have to really know if they were honest. You'd have to really be there. You got to to know what really is so fucking hard man. Because first of all, people, not only are they full of shit, but their memory sucks. People's memories. Like if you, I'm sure you've had a conversation with someone about something that happened that you witnessed as well and you both have totally different memories of memories that terrible.

Speaker 5:          00:21:02       But I've come to accept that though for myself over the last few years, like I used to like clean the memories and then try to argue them. But I think it's been scientifically proven that the human memory is one of the worst pieces of evidence that you could ever call upon. Yeah. The justice system is dining to de prioritize it as well as it should do. Because in the past, like I witnessed, you know, accounts in courtrooms have been very highly prioritized. Like they'd been very highly valued and prized by prosecutors. Wow. Well, I mean this person points out the WHO and the, you know, do you see that person sitting in the courtroom today, madam? And she points their finger and well, it's a slam dunk. Of course that was the perpetrator. Now we realize people are memories all the terrible and wrong all the time. We're really susceptible to suggestion and influence and all that sort of stuff.

Speaker 5:          00:21:48       But I think you kind of remember whether or not your boss who's a television star put his hand up your skirt. Very likely, probably. But there's also someone who could be seriously deceptive and very ambitious and realizes that bill o'reilly's kind of a Twat and this is what I'm going to do. I'm going to get close to this old cut and I'm going to get this guy to get creepy with me. And then I'm an exaggerate what he did and I'm going to profit off of it. Yeah, I mean, do you, you don't understand that they've paid fucking millions of dollars to people. So there's a real industry and getting bill o'reilly to get creepy with you. Like I was a chick, like, especially if I was like a really unscrupulous chick, he tied my knee. That's half a million. He wants to confide. That's a million and a half. This guy's a Douche bag, but this is what I'm gonna do.

Speaker 5:          00:22:34       I'm just going to like kind of give him like a semi green light, you know, just a little bit. I take it back a little bit, take it back. And the problem is though, that this kind of skepticism towards women's stories about sexual assault has, is what has pr permitted? People like him to get away with it for decades and centuries. Right? Like it doesn't agree with you. I take your point that it's hot happening. You know, it's just a, he said, she said, I don't think that's what I think power has gotten, allowed them to get away with it. I think fear and power, the fear of this powerful man, I think that has been the doesn't work. You're not being believed part of that. Maybe I think the repercussions that he's going to ruin your career, that he's going to, that he has influence.

Speaker 5:          00:23:13       And also that if you just play ball, you'll get something from it. You know? I mean, I'm not, especially, I'm not talking about an individual person and saying this individual person not telling the truth. What I'm doing is just making hypothetical's. I'm just saying if I was a check and I was, uh, an unscrupulous sort of social climber and we all know that they exist, and I was the type of person that really wanted to make it in this business, and I was like, look, I'm working for an asshole and I already know this five chicks we got paid. They've already paid out 13 million bucks. I'm going to, I'm going to and move in on this.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       I'm interested that that route that turned on him. Then Rupert Murdoch turned on him and kicked him out when he's still making a ton of money. He's still the number one cable show. Right? Or he was, well, maybe Tucker Carlson had a meeting with him, pulled him aside. They listen. Fuck God. That tide comes in and out. Jesus fucking speaking of someone who will say whatever they think their audience wants them to say, Taka. That's, he got right there with his stupid old bow tie. He doesn't have a bow. Tiny one. It's no, he got rid of it soon. It's a straight time. Yeah. Both ties to gay. Exactly. Don't be associated with that. Or clowns or you know, someone who's got like a camera in it. It's, I'm amazed that he's had his renaissance taka like he was there was that classic John Stewart moment when he used to host crossfire.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       Chuck Tucker Carlson and John went on, he was like, you're a grown man wearing a bow tie, stop hurting America. The Johnston in that regard where he was funny on his show when he was doing a scripted monologue and talking to people who was gracious but did view, if he came on your show and he had an issue with you, you would find out how fucking smart and mean he could really go after you. Absolutely. Which is, which is good cause I mean Taco. Yeah. Would it be to think about whether or not bill o'reilly believes what he believes? I don't think tuck a nose. Like taco has this constant faith. He has this have, you know, if you're listening to audio podcasts, you can see my face, but it's kind of furrowed brow and like mouth breathing, kind of like, you know, he, he, he plays the role of like the bemused clown who doesn't know who's just, I'm just a common man from mine, just middle America.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       I don't understand what you're talking about. And he's like very, very, very riding the fence, very kind of riding the fence. Very like never quite having an, I'm just missed a common sense. Like I'm just saying it like I see it anyway. I don't know. I would assume that a lot of these women were telling the truth. No one. I'm not, I'm definitely not saying that they weren't telling the truth. What I'm saying is, I don't know. I don't know what happened or what didn't happen. I don't know whether he should be fired or shouldn't be fired. You mean? Uh, I think he feels that he fills a niche. Right. And if it's my company and you have to worry about this guy representing you. Oh, okay. I see. Where you wouldn't want that guy representing you because he's problematic and people think he's a creep.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       But he could just go do his own shit. Like Glenn Beck, he little Horn antic of course he wish or something and he's not going to go away quietly. I mean it's an interesting, it's an interesting question about what happens to the right wing media now. Cause if Roger ailes is no longer at Fox News and Bill O'reilly is no longer at Fox News for the same reason, for the same reason, but exactly both guys the same. The plays into the same narrative doesn't let of dirty old white guy. Just a fuck fest going on over there at Fox News may him just young women. It's like an old, like an old porky's movie or like one of those 1970s national lampoon films with women with their tits hanging, hanging out. People are to the dorm tweeten and Hannity now your next handed it. Yeah, exactly. You're going after him now and Breitbart's had its dude Steve Bannon sideline in the White House.

Speaker 1:          00:26:51       So if he can't get along with trump anymore, is that true? I don't know. I don't, I'm not friends with him. I love rumors. I don't call him up. Hey Steve. Hey stevie, Stevie Bay. How you doing? How are you doing with that? With Donnie these days? How are you guys still close? Jared is running the show now. That's right. And I think he had to make a decision and he kind of sideline to the, the white nationalists a bit. Any kind of empowered the old school Republican orthodoxy. Gee, you'd be pissed if you were a trump voter, wouldn't you? Did have a Jew running shit. Well not just to have a job. Doesn't help. Joe's doesn't help. But no, I just mean like so much of what he sort of ran on was like, it's going to be different. It's not going to be the same old politics and now you know we're going to repeal obamacare. Well that didn't work out. That's just going to be tax co. Now he bombed Syria where you weren't supposed to be bombing people. I thought we were going to get out of all these foreign wars and shit. Don't care like that

Speaker 5:          00:27:43       many people, they, they have this cognitive dissonance that they have in addressing his actions as so they're, they're the support of him. They're so happy that they won. They would, they would never want to take away their victory. Like the people that are happy that trump is in office are so happy that he won and they won with him. That any little thing that happens, they just come up with some sort of a way to rational

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       some of them do. Some of them do. I start a story the other day about a, about a county in Pennsylvania or something which is, uh, which had voted for Obama twice and then voted for trump because they thought they were going to get changed and they're all just like, well, he just seems like a regular Republican. He's going to try to attack cut taxes for the rich and go, go to war with foreign countries, isn't from what this is and what we bargained for. But it'll be interesting to see whether or not they flip back and four years. I take your point that they're just really happy that hillary is not the president. There's a lot of people that are really happy. She's not the president. I think bill's the biggest, I think bill's super happy. It's like fine. I didn't want to have to go back. I don't know. There was a law. The tail in that house.

Speaker 5:          00:28:50       He gets plenty of tail. Yeah. Betty downside side. Did you see all that Sheila Riley political system in the wikileaks memos about the Commonwealth. What was talking about him banging hookers on the side was like talking about how bills at home banging bimbos and there was some thing about me, Colin Powell is just fucking blitz it in emails. They talk shit like just like regular people. Yeah. Don't put it in an email very well and we learned nothing. Don't send it to fucking anybody who's got an insecure server.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       No. Well just don't write it down at all and not even get kind of rarely talk now anyway. Cause that means that you're going to be spied. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:30       How are we going to have a private conversations to just to just pull shit on people just let it fly. This like what we've said here, cause usually have been in a, in a private email. Yup that's right. Questioning whether or not bill o'reilly's intelligent or whether or not he really believes that or whether or not in a religious people are actually intelligent, which I f you know clearly there there's a lot of religious people that are intelligent and I mean part of the problem is that people give too much of a crap about things that people have said in the past. I mean we've spoken about this before in relation to political correctness or something or like using the wrong language. I think as more and more of what we say gets intercepted or at least in susceptible in emails and also in phone calls and so on and we're being spied on all the time and things can be leaked and things can be hacked.

Speaker 5:          00:30:15       People are just going to have to chill the fuck out a little bit about people's past. Otherwise we're only going to end up with the most boring anodyne and people in positions of power because it's only going to be people who've always watched exactly what they say, who are able to, who have never kind of triggered a trip wire and who have never gotten people angry and just sense trumps the big victory for that. That's right. You see what I said after trump was elected that political correct. It's just took a missile to the Dick. Absolutely. This is just, it just shows you, you could be out there and grabbing pussies talking crap fucking people, man. It's okay. Like it's, it's not, it's the world has changed in that regard and part of the, I mean part of the problem there is that the things that he, some of the things that he says really I ad like, I don't think that it's appropriate to be to, to talk about women the way that he talks about women. I don't think it's appropriate.

Speaker 5:          00:31:08       Basically. Basically the problem with that is he's talking to a dude and trying to make them laugh. Yeah. I mean, he's having a private conversation with a guy and he's doing what he called locker room talk. Guys Talk Shit. And they say things they don't really mean and he's, what he said was, and I'm not, I'm not an apologist, just let me get this out of the way. What he said was, you can just grab them by the Pussy. They let you, you can do anything that you want when you were a big celebrity. He just grabbed him by the pussy. Like what he's saying is not, I grab women by the Pussy and sexually assault them. Well, he's just being totally outrageous. It's like a punchline for a joke. He's exaggerating the reality of the situation. He's saying he's so famous saying, when you're as famous as me, you can do anything.

Speaker 5:          00:31:55       You can grab them by the pussy thing. He's trying that you, he's saying they let you meaning implying consent. Right. And I say he's not talking about sexual assault. What's, so when people were saying, you know, he's doing sexual assault. No, he's talking about girls that are in thrawled with the fact that they're around. This guy was his fucking name on skyscrapers and he flies around with a jet with his name on it. And if you're that type of woman and there are that look, there's that type of men. There's that type of women were not, it does not a gross generalization about men or women but guaranteed your son some women that when they're in the face of a guy like Donald Trump, they react that way and they let him do anything they want and they love it. Yeah, there is that possibility. There is that possibility. I also thought that the phrasing of that term was, it was kind of funny like yeah they let you grab them but like how

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       do you grab it to see exactly like where do your fingers go? Like, well, when does this some who's doing like, so what? It sounded to me like with someone who is inept sexually, which by many accounts he is like, there are lots of accounts of like when he was married to or dating the most beautiful people, he'd be downstairs eating Cheetos, watching late night news, cable news while they were upstairs. Like not believe that will because well just, just compare it to whether or not it comports with what, what else do you know about him, which is that he's very image focused and cares a lot about being thought to be the best at everything and the most glamorous and the richest. So it's, you would imagine that it would be consistent with his personality, that he would want to present a front of being more of a slayer and more of a sexual demon than he actually is sexual bands.

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       It's a great name for a band. It's the sites. So the grab them by the Pussy. It sort of reminded me a little bit of the way that 15 year old boys would talk to each other. Yeah, Dude. Or two guys say ridiculous things that they don't mean you get other people to laugh. I will, I will grant you that. Girls do too. I mean, my point about political correctness is that I don't think trump has is our best, uh, ambassador for the anti political correctness brigade. Like, and part of his rise, part of the backlash is a backlash against the, you know, we've had so many conversations that we all know it by now with we're bored of like people who go, who absolutely lose their, you know, just go crazy because you use the wrong transgender pronoun or something like that. You know, you say he instead of she or whatever it is all these times or microaggressions and stuff like that, or all of that kind of bullshit, I think gave rise to an environment in which people are so frustrated with political correctness that they unleashed.

Speaker 3:          00:34:23       And it was like a pressure cooker exploding and, and the trump hair went everywhere and just trump, he's the, yeah, exactly. But I don't think it'd be, you know, things would have been better if we hadn't gotten to that place. And we could all just take a chill pill. I think we need to learn, you know, and I think we need to make mistakes so that we can learn. One of the things that's really unfortunate is that he doesn't tell the truth and that he's the president and he shows that you can just not tell the truth and be the president. Yeah. About all kinds of things. The alternative facts analogy, you know what I mean? I'm trying to grapple with this on my podcast. Um, because I think it's, I think what's, what's dangerous about trump is that is not just that he, he doesn't tell the truth because lots of people point out, many politicians don't tell the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:35:09       It's that he doesn't even care that he's not telling the truth and he doesn't behave as if there is such a thing. Really as truth. Like the other day he talked about the, the warships that were heading for the Korean Peninsula. Did you see this, this story? He said that we've got this aircraft carrier, which is going towards Korea. It was going in the opposite direction to Australia to not attack Australia. But do I have a military exercise with the ozzies and now and then Sean Spicer got there, you know the press corps went crazy and the White House correspondence and Sean Spicer was like, well I agree. He was saying that it had been heading, it was going to be going to the Korean Peninsula but it was just do on a DJ. So he wasn't saying the actual direction of the aircraft carrier. He was saying that it was, he was talking about the overall strategy of what and like poor old spicy is out there trying to make trump statements comport with something with reality in some way.

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       But trump is just an explosive like vomit machine just tweeting out stuff that doesn't even have to map onto reality at all. And he always seems to take pride I think in the fact that he can say whatever million people at the inauguration. When I started talking the rain stopped and the sun. That was pretty good. Are you working on that show? No, I like the impression that needs work. It needs a little work, but everyone's got their trump. But you know what I mean? He, he will say things and then almost take, I feel like he gets his Joel, he gets his rocks off through the sheer audacity of being able to say whatever the hell he wants and just make his opponents go crazy because they don't even get to a game of whack a mall then. Right. It's like, well, you said, that's true.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       So he's acting as a politician for the first time in his life and he's 70. So for his entire life he's been this braggadocious guy who is exaggerated facts and built up this amazing persona and exaggerated wealth and he's obviously very successful but exaggerates that success. So like the thing about him winning the inauguration, remember that really interesting exchange that he had with a reporter. It was young reporter and he was up there saying, we won by the largest margin now blah, just margin in the electoral college. That's not true. And he said, well, the law just for, um, Republican, a Republican. And that's also true. So he said, George H. Bush or George Herbert Walker Bush had much larger margin. And so he explained to him, well, you will agree that we won by substantial number. Yeah, well you are the president. Thank you. He was like, good, I want tic TAC toe.

Speaker 4:          00:37:42       Exactly. It's just, it's just he's not a politician and that's what people like about them, you know? But then he starts doing all these different things like, you know, he's trying to get all these different plants to reopen and give Americans jobs and they talk about all the jobs that have been created and people get excited and they signed this new thing yesterday. Uh, you know, American made American sales and try to encourage people to buy and make American and, and then trying to get rid of foreigners that are sneaking over here and doing bad things and you know, the base, the people that have been clamoring for that kind of response get very excited. That's cool. We'll, we'll, we'll deal with the lies. The lies are fine. As long as he opens up that Ford plant, they'll, the lies are bad. But look, he got those, a Guatemalan terrorists, drug dealers out of Chicago or whatever. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:38:26       Yeah. And I think the, I think that there's a feeling that the whole people who regard themselves as being custodians of the truth, a Hoity toity out of touch, a Leitz who've been shitting the trump support, the honest, hardworking trump supporter for so long that they deserve to be slapped in their face with a little bit of untruthful truthiness. Sure.

Speaker 5:          00:38:44       And the judges and the academics people smarter than you. Yeah. People more educated than you and her spitting social acts and it makes you humiliated. I feel dumb. Yeah. Like the tide goes in, the tide goes out to explain it. It's kind of the same appeal. Yeah, that's right. That's right. I mean that people do love when liberals get their comeuppance. Liberals are really classically associated with education, higher education, bigger vocabularies, universities.

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       Funny things about trump that he's the anti elitist as if the, as if it is non elite to be a Manhattan real estate billionaire.

Speaker 5:          00:39:28       How has that, how has that, the anti elite, you just have to say anything. When Rowan, George Bush pretended he was from fucking Texas. Lot of people don't realize he's from, yeah, he's from the northeast. He went to Yale. Yeah. He all he did in Texas was clear brush and brush it. And when people are looking, Yep. Camera's rolling. Absolutely. Chainsawing down trees. But it's, you know, it's the American way. You pitch people an image. I mean it is why they have publicists. Why,

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       I mean when you say though that trump is like he's not a politician and that's what people like about him. Yeah. There's the worry is that when you're president of the United States, shit you say has any impact, right? It is an important position. So things, things that you say can be misinterpreted by the Koreans or the Russians. And there's a, like if you are the president, you should know that people in the executive branch, such as the president of people in the White House, should not disparage people in the judicial branch. Right. Because we have a separation of powers in the United States of America. So when he made those comments, for example about the judiciary, I think a lot of people think like, oh, why is everyone getting their tits on a tangle about them? Just because he said that the judge was a, you know, implied that the judge was biased in the trump university case.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       It's because presidential candidates shouldn't be shitting on judges because otherwise you end up with situations like you've got in Venezuela or now in Turkey, they've just had this referendum over the past weekend, which gave sort of quasi dictatorial powers to Turkey's president. Similar things happening in Turkey come dictatorships essentially, essentially. And Russia has done that over the past 10 or 15 years. And when you listen to people who are experts in these things, they always say, I was just listening to Masha Gessen who's really into, you know, Marcia, she's a Russian journalist who lives in the states now. Fascinating person. She'd be a good person to get to get on the show. And she was saying that the, the, the things that, that nice and to dictators always liked to do is take, take down a peg. People who, uh, who, who rely facts for their living.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       So that's journalists. It's people in the judicial department and his academics. So it's judges, lawyers, academics and so on. That's always what you see. Like the Putin's and again, the sort of bill o'reilly mindset of like tide goes in, tide goes out, hey, I'm just a regular guy. I've got my gut going for me. I don't need all these fancy book learning. It's just you and me. Let's go to Washington DC and take it back from those fancy elites making America great, right? And we're going to do it just without balls. We're going to grab them by the Pussy and we're going to drag this country until the 21st century come. What may you should run for office, goddammit, you're phone out of the country. That's a stupid rule. It is America. Most countries don't have that natural bone rule. Most countries, if you move to that country and you become a citizen and you live there for a certain period of time, sure you can move from the highest office to run for office and all offended.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       Would you run for office if it was available? I think I can run for office. I think I can't run for president. Obviously Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor. That's correct. Exactly. So I hereby announce my candidacy for the governorship of California. Joe Rogan even live here. Dude, I do now. When did you move? I move. I've kind of oozed between New York and Los Angeles over the course of the past four months. But you're an elite by coastal guy wearing an accent. You hear elite by coastal guy and from another country. Look, if I was al Qaeda, I know. I would say the way to get somebody to slip them in is not to get some brown guy who looks like an Arab, nosy, handsome Ozzie. No one's going to think that the an Aussie, especially a gay wasn't exactly. That's right. I'm married having twins, Joe. Oh my goodness. How? How's that work?

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       It's very complicated. Do you have somebody that carries them for you? Yeah. Does she live with, you know? Oh, that's weird. Yeah, that's extra sheets, right? Yeah. We're trying. That's how you don't want to be controlling who's just, did you choose? We used, we used my edges because we used because, uh, um, cause you're the boss. I'm the boss. Exactly. Are you the dad figured that out yet? I didn't say we had twins yet. They're in the oven. I have a couple that lives down the street from me. They're gay couple and I've known them for probably about 15 years. And uh, they have a child and I'm watching this kid grow. They went through the whole thing and they went through the whole thing. Their kids friends with my kid and has been since it was a baby and he's about seven or eight now.

Speaker 1:          00:43:50       And they went through the whole thing where they had a surrogate, the whole deal. She carries it and then at the end of it she's like, I'm keeping this. Oh Wow. Yeah. They paid for the kids and that was Kosha. She won. I mean she got it. Do you know, because you know that's unusual because California is usually outside. It gets not in California, but you, it tends to have pretty good, uh, pro family surrogacy laws by which I mean it makes it hard for the, sorry, I get to change your mind at the, at the end we'll they did in 2000 it was like early 2000 Oh yeah. That might changed somewhere in do bloody Australia. I mean, let me whine for a moment about how backward Australia was 10 or 15

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       years ago when I first started coming to the states, I was able to look down my progressive knows at these fine United States of America and think of it as being a more conservative center, right country. But now you guys are legalizing pot all over the joint. You've got the gay marriage. Australia still doesn't like a lot of, I feel like a lot of interesting stuff is going on in the states, in on the progressive side of politics and culture that Australia has just been too slow to pick up. So on the, on the question of surrogacy, there's this weird like alliance in Australia that also exist in some communities here in the states between essentially extreme feminists and like right wing Christians to say that women should not be allowed to take money to b Sarragut carriers from the Christian riot. They say, you know, we shouldn't let these fags, you know, be using women to about an hour to create life, God forbid. And from the feminists it's, Oh, we have to protect women from being manipulated and taking money for having, for renting their wounds out. But you want them to have the right to kill a, an unborn baby.

Speaker 1:          00:45:44       No, no, no. It's not that. It's what you don't want. It's a medical procedure. It's not telling you baby, it's a bundle of cells until it comes to batch of cells and then all of a sudden until it gets a social security number. Yeah, not real.

Speaker 3:          00:45:55       So you want a woman to be able to kill that bunch of cells, but you don't want her to be able to bring that bunch of cells into existence, then get paid for it. In Australia. You can't. It's against the law to be pet to, to pay a surrogate to carry your child. It has to be a favor,

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       but prostitution's legal. You guys are just confused. We were confused. Nation lost on the wrong side of the planet. Well, you're a tiny land. You know it's a giant chunk of ground as big as the United States, but a tiny group of people, a bunch of Los Angeles. That's right. We're the same population as well. Bit bigger than greater Los Angeles. You're not counting Mexicans. They don't know skins are over here. They just don't. They do and they do a census anyway. Most people say, most people say la is 18 or 19 million. Australia is 24 but who's counting? Listen, it's hop greater. La is connected to Orange County is connected to the inland empire is can. It's not like it stops, you know like when you still chatting Joe, I'm with you. Okay. We agree about the lodge list of Los Angeles County. Your country is not as big as ours. I'm just saying, but it's the same size. The same size. Yeah. If you, if you exclude Alaska then it's the same size as the United States. You take ewas you know the United States. Exactly. So it's got basically half the population in California. Yeah. You have a tiny little spot. I know it's in terms of human beings, so we have some tiny, where have you been to New Zealand yet? No, I heard it's awesome. No, it's great. I mean that is a small place. It's gorgeous. Beautiful. I'm half

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       New Zealand. Yeah. How do you know like aren't on the same shit he has basically. It's like so half Canadian California saying they're from Nevada. Like do you even know? Well it is a different country. Georgia. That one right? It's another island. Yup. Go to fly over there. You have a row to row 1200 miles. Can you row 1200 miles? Fuck yeah. Polynesians can like that's true. They can and did, they did. So they got to Hawaii. Tanga used to control basically all of the South Pacific. They were, they, they were absolutely bad. Atses see the size of those fucking people. Yeah. They big the giant. They have giant bones. They, how do they fit in the canoe? They build big canoes, Bro. Very big canoes and canoe full of toxins can, if I pull a pantry, 350 pound tongue is big humans, they probably really big back then too. Even when people weren't as big, they were probably bigger.

Speaker 5:          00:48:21       I think they've always been bigger. Hello? Americans are giving them a run for their money right now. And a stand I was, he's starting to get fat. Well it's food, foods, the high protein count. I mean you've seen it in Japan as well. You know, people are just larger, you know, they're eating more food and, and we're eating more sugar that too. Well there's also the, I had Gary Tobbs on who wrote that book the case against sugar. And one of the things that he was saying, it was really kind of interesting is that when you feed people a higher sugar diet, the higher insulin count is actually making larger people. So he's talking about his kids and that like you almost like wants to feed his kids more sugar to make, you know, bigger athletes. And I'm like, that's crazy. So big or not in terms of having more body fat, larger, larger humans, larger human, like taller as well.

Speaker 5:          00:49:05       Bigger. Yeah, just bigger people. Yeah. There's some evidence that points to the high sugar diet as well as the high protein diet are contributing factors to people being larger. Could I just ate a lot of Donna's not now. Not too long to miss the budge. Yeah. How old would I had to be when I want to be like a little kid? I think you have to be like, I love you got to have a couple of twins fish out a fuck or sugar stuff. Their faces full of chocolate. Best News I've heard all day. You just kind of get like to the wall of diabetes and pull back. Oh, this'll be great, by the way. Always want to get real clear. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, so don't go feed your kids down at, and I don't even remember exactly what Gary Topp said.

Speaker 5:          00:49:45       Jamie's Colin's a liability of being Joe Rogan story. The other day I showed you. This is after the show. Let's get [inaudible] spilling onto Wisconsin highway. We're headed for cattle feed. Oh yeah, they do do that. They give it the cows candy. Yeah. That's just to fatten them up the cheaper. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They do do that. They feed cows candy to make them fatter. They've done, they also feed them antibiotics just to, just to make them bigger, just to make them grow faster. Oh actually the reason why they feed them antibiotics is their bodies reject the grain there, feed them corn and things like that and they develop abscesses and their books to affections to fall. Apparently it's for that reason. And also it just has this side, the byproducts that it makes them grow faster. Antibiotics, antibiotics. Yup. Oh weird. Yeah. It's bizarre. I don't try to take those things anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I know was I really need them. Surgery when you get surgery should take it. Yeah, that's right. But you should be real careful about taking them for like little colds. I think I'm just going to take a z pack. Yup. Yeah. You're going to make a super virus. You fuck. That's right. And if you do, then make sure that you take probiotics and shit. Eat a lot of Kimchi and sauerkraut and all that stuff. Here you go buddy. Yeah, I know. I've been listening to Joe Rogan. You know where I got that? That inflammation problems. Yeah, exactly. That's right. She's, she's good value isn't she? She's a genius. Yeah. Um, she's making a person, I wonder if she's going to feed it sugar. How old? How long? How far along was it? Third Person. Third Trimester. Okay. Yeah. I needed to learn all that shit. I'm not good with like the numbers of human physiology.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       I didn't know what a trimester was. It's difficult. You're a guy cause I don't have a slide. I don't have cycles. I don't have the cycles of the men steroid administration and the moon and the tide comes in and the tide goes out and the blood comes in, into the band comes out. It's impossible to explain and the baby comes out. Sweet baby. Jesus is the only explanation. Joe. So explain to me what the law is right now in Australia. Like, can you hire a surrogate or is it being pushed back? Well that's a state by state thing cause the strategy of results. So a federation like the United States, which he used to be a bunch of separate colonies. So it used to be a bunch of, you know, penal colonies that Britain basically after the American revolution, Britain had no where to send its criminals. And it was a very, very tough law and order states in the 17 hundreds in the UK.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       Like if you, it was three strikes and you're out. That wasn't even in the start of it. And it was incredible inequality. There was no welfare obviously and no food stamps and shit like that. So people who were starving would steal a loaf of bread and you do that twice and they'd be like, all right, we're going to send you to the moon, which is essentially a strategy. Right? So they went and found, they discovered this great southern land that had been rumored about and had been kind of sketched on the edges by some of the explorers from the Netherlands and from France so far. And they sent out captain cook to settle it basically. So they would have a place for creative criminals to examine a huge, vast sunburnt land for criminals to to run free. And now that they could no longer use United States any of those colonies.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       It's one of the most beautiful places in the world and some of the nicest people in the world lived there like they fucked up. They made it a better place than ain't sent the criminals and the criminals. Like, you know what our problem was? We were living in fucking England. It never, it's never sunny. People are constantly bars or a thousand years old. Jesus Christ, I feel so good. I'm going to be a criminal anymore. I'm going to go south and Oh, oh please judge. Don't send me to the other side of the world to a tropical paradise when I could be living here in London where it's dirty and disease written and it's rainy and drizzly and gray all the time. But isn't it of bid? How there's a balance to everything. Cause when you go to Australia, everything can fucking kill you. Yeah, that's true. Part of the problem is, but goddamn box, jelly, fish, Brown spiders and Brown snakes and all these different things.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       It can fuck you up, but you don't feel afraid of that when you're in Australia. Do you you get over that and 24 hours? No, not me. I'm a POC. Terrified of bugs and snakes and shit. Cause I'm the, I mean you do to typically that you're much more likely to be killed in it on the freeway here in la or by someone shooting you in the states than you are by appspider. Biden say bless you. Go near the spiders and the snakes, which is what I would do. Let me know the problem with me, I don't approach them. We'll have a buddy of mine, my friend Adam Green tree was a big bow hunter in Australia. Yep. So He's trying to get me to go hang out with them and I'm always like, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do that. And then they send me a picture of some fucking spider that a vicious poisonous spider eating a vicious poisonous snake.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       The fuck do you live, man, this is insane. Crocodiles everywhere. They went hunting and they didn't bring any water and they just figured they would find water and they use water purification systems and cleaned it out. So they're drinking buffalo piss water cause he's water buffaloes. They piss in this water and then you have these filter pumps and you pump out all the toxins but it still tastes like piss because you're essentially drinking purified pests and um, they were cooling off in this water and they, they didn't realize that there's crocodiles in the area, Shit. So they easily could've got checked by a crocodile crocodile slide into that water and they just sit and wait. But it's one of those things that you just led about as a kid. It's a bit like, I mean people like, it's like when you talk to Canadians about the risk of bears and they just sort of laugh it off because you learn about how, or like people from Finland about falling through the ice on a frozen lake.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       These are just things that you learn about when you're a kid and you just take it for granted. I know where they will be. Crocodiles 99% of the time and I don't go to those places and I certainly don't. Well sure, yeah, exactly. Get ready. Farmer will be be with a group of people. I mean in terms of the, in terms of like how good it was for convicts. I mean people came out to Australia for um, you know, Brits came out to Australia even if they weren't criminals just because they wanted a new, like a new adventure. I mean, my, and some of the states of Australia actually we're free settler colonies like South Australia, which is one of the states was never a convict, a penal colony. And in fact, when Australia became a country in 1901, they w in the constitutional conventions in the eighties and nineties, which, which created a country out of all of these previously separate colonies, New Zealand within negotiations to be part of that country as well.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       And Western Australia, which is the western half of the continent was going to be a separate country. And the eastern half, the eastern states of Australia and New Zealand could have been a single country. And then at the last minute and New Zealand jumped out in Western Australia, jumped in and now you've got two different countries. But Anyway, oh this massive huntsman spider in Australia is what? Yeah, but huntsman's aren't, they don't hurt you. It gives a fuck. Kill Them. When you get those, you get those spiders, spiders inside even in Sydney, but then on size harmful God damn giant crab. That's huge. It's on a broom. So it's not, you can tell that it's big enough to scare the fuck out of you. If it was in your underwear, you die. Yeah. You know New Zealand is a place that's really fascinating because they brought over all these wild game animals from other countries to turn it into a paradise.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       And I think they did in the 17 hundreds of the 1800 it would have been insane. Hundreds cause I think it was only settled by white people in the 17 hundreds yeah. And now they're the run rampant around the island cause there's no predators. So they have these hordes of red stags from Europe. They're wandering around New Zealand. We spoke last time about the, about the attempt that New Zealand is doing to basically eradicate all of its predators, all of its invasive predators who that have come from abroad like New Zealand because it was the last country to be settled by white people by White Farnaz that is who brought, you know, foxes and rabbits and whatever nasty things. I always forget exactly what called cats too. I can't even remember what, every time I say this publicly, someone from New Zealand, he was like, actually we don't have Fox News on twitter, so I definitely do in Australia caddy and have the same issue.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       You have the same issue in Australia. Totally, totally. But in Australia it's too far gone. There's no way that you would be able to actually eradicate them. Whereas in New Zealand there is like it is, it is a New Zealand, his patriotic duty to murder as many little mammals as they can because those little mammals eat the night of birds and eat all the native wildlife and stuff. So New Zealand is like my cousins over there. They set traps out in their yard and every morning they go down like they with bloodied hands pulling out the caucus is of animals that they've killed and they're like, oh yeah, this good job. Good for you. Well Australia a bit bow hunting magazines show people holding cats up like domestic cat. I hold them and you gotta like an Arrow through the heart. And there was a guy recently who got attacked on instagram because he's an Australian bow hunter and he's out bow hunting and he killed this cat and all these people were freaking out.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       That was some of these pat you piece of shit. And they're like, actually you don't understand this is the ruining the ground nesting birds, all these different animals that live in the ground, that mean to the animals that have never had a Predator to like that and they're missed or do just getting destroyed. They're a menace that as cats they get out. Yeah, it's hopeless on the question of, isn't that beautiful, nice shirt. Reagan nose blow right there and you've got a cold or is it just, uh, I left someone off fighting, went off. Don't take antibiotics and you can say, I'm, I'm almost out of it. But I worked out today pretty hard. Some fucking crazy, bro. What'd you do? Lifting weights. Kettle kettlebells. You know, I do.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       Um, what was I gonna say about Australian animals too? I forgot. Uh, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's amazing that there is imbalanced. Oh, that's what it was. The, you're a Tasmanian tiger, which was an animal that was extinct. Yeah. Apparently there's a bunch of sightings this thing and they're pretty sure that it might actually still be alive. I've read that. I hope so. It'd be, there's, there's this really depressing footage. You can say it online of the, uh, of the, the last day of a Tasmanian tiger eye in a zoo, uh, just pacing back and forth and back and forth, wiped it out completely. 1930s. Right, exactly. Footage it really early. I mean, they basically destroyed everything in Tasmania. They wiped out the, the night of aboriginal through and wiped out the paypal. They wiped out. I mean, it was like, you know, Haley, oh, the British empire.

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       Let's make things better by killing. Everything is interesting. Do you guys change the British accent? Just a little. Whereas like most Americans can't tell where the fuck you're from. How do you not tell? Honestly, it's really, it's the same thing. It's obviously not in the, it's been half up. You're not from here. I can tell the difference between Canadian and American. Well that's easy. Done easy. Cause you were American as soon as you hear a boat. Exactly. But then they're nicer. I mean actually that is less different than the difference between British and Australian. Consider a place. Can you tell us what's going on in New Zealand and Arizona accent and a California accent? Don't know. Neither one have one. It was a trick question.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       Come on with an Arizona accident. What the fuck is in Arizona accent? Yeah. Now the only American accent so that I can easily pick apart from the big city ones. Cause you can tell Boston, you can tell in New York he can, uh, that's a bet. That's basically it is the south. See there's that midwestern thing where like Minnesota and Wisconsin and have that all that cane, da Fargo, that sort of Fargo. We accent. Uh, and then you've got the, yeah, the west coast thing and then the, but that Fargo thing is similar to Canadian as well. A little bit. It gets a little bit confusing sometimes when you're a foreigner, like myself. Friendly people that live in the cold. That's right. Yes. They have to be like helping each other out. Sense of community. Canadians. It's sort of like aussies, you know, they were also big landmass.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Not very many people. Mostly in hospital. Most of them are huddled along one stretch of land in, in Canada it's the, it's the border. And in Australia it's the coastline. Yeah. I think they have less people than California as well. Yeah, they have about the same I think. I think they have a bit more than Australia. I feel like 50 million or something. Yeah, exactly. Um, I'd moved there. Those are the two places I'd moved. By the way, if I didn't live in America, like if some shit hit the fan here, if California, California slid into the ocean and the big earthquake or something, um, I would either live in Canada or Australia. Those are two spots. Hold Joe. Are you aware of that? To be cold on Vancouver? No, but it's rainy and cloudy and gray. Beautiful Green on the three days a week. When it's a year, when it's sunny, it's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       People are cool as fuck. 362 days a year. Horrible. Don't be a pussy. Chrisley so what? Stay inside good strip down gets me down. Mr [inaudible] tell you when it is something I guess. I guess I get seasonal affective disorder because my sister in law is from Finland and when I go to Finland and it's gray and doc, I don't feel good. You get sad. I get sad, I get sad and I actually, I don't mind the cold called and I'm under really frigid freezing. Karl lived in New York for 10 ish years, depending on how you count it and the and the winters out there when it's crisp and bright and blue sky. I mean you grew up in the north face. You know what that's like when it's a nice day. I don't actually care if it's only five degrees Fahrenheit, if it's, if it's like sunny.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       Right. But I don't like gloom New York and Boston in particular. It gets really gloomy in the winter. I definitely think that affects people. I definitely used to affect me, but um, it's not as bad. Like Colorado gets super fucking cold, but it's really sunny and Colorado doesn't have any of that shit. It's not, I agree with you. It's not necessarily the cold as much as it is the lack of Sun. We need clear scars. That's Ryan's feel better. Yeah. That's what I don't like about London and Amsterdam and said he's like that as well. Seattle, Portland, Portland Tomorrow Holla, two shows. Oh Great. Nice city. But again, fuck you. Portland's awesome. How many days of the year does it rain? 289 days of sunshine in Vancouver. That's what he's a pussy. Shit. What is Jamie? What are you looking up here? They comp results. It does say there's 166 days with measurable precipitations that does a bat up at the top. It does because we're rains part of the day, but hang on 299 days of sunshine. That just might mean that at some point during the day there was a bit of a glimmer of some, that's all I need bro.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       Just set up a little alarm to go. I know we're still on a planet. I knew there's, or a bubbles. Good. Uh, have you seen about um, about the election in the cool, quite a few stories coming out of Europe this week. I did a story I did my podcast today about, there's the British prime minister just called a snap election. Try to reaffirm her mandate for brexit. And the French had gone to the polls next week and for the first round of the presidential election, which could see the far right leader, Marine Le Pen Win in France. And if she does, she wants to crash out of the euro currency, you know, break, do frexit brexit crush any France leaves the EU. Then that actually is all live. I like penetration can leave if that happens. When would France leave the EU? I saw that there's massive antifascist protest this week.

Speaker 1:          01:04:17       Yeah. So the way that their electoral system works is they, instead of doing it all on one day, they basically, whoever can run and get on the ballot, they, there's like maybe eight to 12 candidates who are on the ballot next week. And then assuming that one person doesn't get one of them, doesn't get more than 50% of the vote, which I almost never do. That then goes to a second round of Palette, which is next month. And that's the actual presidential election between the two main candidates. And what it looks like is that the far right leader who is softer than her dad who founded the far right party was, but he was like a Holocaust denier and like serious antisemites and she's just a, an anti Muslim like anti-immigration Nteu sort of like more right wing version of trump. Uh, she will get through in next week's election, which means that she's going to wane her, I don't know, the polls say she wasn't, but the polls didn't say that brexit was going to happen or that Donald Trump was gonna win either. So the question is, will people stay at home? Because the person who she's most likely to be running against is just this kind

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       of slick, nice, handsome, doesn't really believe in anything. Not really a politician, but kind of pragmatic. I mean maybe that'll work, I don't know, but it's a bit of a worry if you care about the stability of Europe and like Germany and France not ever being in a war again for them not to be knitted together and into the European Union. I do worry about it. And then there was the Turkey thing that we were talking about, so we've got these three, these kinds of pieces of jigsaw puzzle that had been bashing around in my head over the past few days about like, will we look back on this period as just a starting point to something even bigger? Like I already think that it's amazing like that trump is amazing. Like I mean if two years ago I was on, when was I first on this show? Maybe three years ago or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       You know, if someone had walked in that door and said to us, okay, in 2017 you are going to be back on the show, are you going to be talking to each other? And the FBI will be conducting an active investigation into whether or not the government of the day conspired with Putin in Russia to spread misinformation and illegally hack the emails of the Democratic Party on, by the way, the president is Donald Trump and we know that the hacking happened. We know that the Russians hacked, did hack this and did spread misinformation. But the only question is whether the FBI is trying to figure out whether or not there was active collaboration with the government. What do you think about that? I mean we would be like, that's a cartoon. That's a fucking cartoon story. That is cray crazy cloud cuckoo land. And so that's where my head has been at.

Speaker 5:          01:06:59       But that would have been, if we did have that conversation, that would have been before the nightclub shooting in Paris that have been before the truck ran over those people in Nice. Yup. Like the, those are those terrorist attacks that they have had over in France and in Germany have scared the fucking shit out of people and letting all those people in from Syria with no vetting and letting a lot of Muslims coming to the country that may have some real hate in their heart for this new land that they've found. I mean they've got some real issues and that's when a person who's a fascist who comes along who's like this anti immigration, you know, comes from a racist background, super right wing. That's when those people take hold. Well this is

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       what I always say. I'm actually, I'm talking to Sam Harris tomorrow on my podcast and this is something that he and I talk about a lot, which is we have to find a new way to converse about the problem of, of Islamic jihadism without being so full of shit. If we, if you are, if you are a globalist and an international list like I am, if you basically believe

Speaker 5:          01:07:59       you're a globalist, that's a negative thing. I know I've only started using that term lately because the old Wright thinks that globalism is like this Jewish, you know, global conspiracy and I love, I'm trying to take over the world. I'm open. I'm an open minded person so I think what I would define it, well I would it as being someone who doesn't like borders and who doesn't like nationalism and jingoism and believes that we are all one and should try to get along. You don't want to hear Bro. I hear new world order. That's what I hear. This motherfucker's new world order. I can't hear you if we got him on the show. Is that what that, was that an Alex Jones impression? It was getting close, wasn't it? Alex Jones is a performance artist. Is that what you're claiming? You know what, I ask people on twitter what I should ask you and overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly it's all like why does he legitimize quacks like Alex Jones creates a false equivalents problem.

Speaker 5:          01:08:49       Oh No, no, no, no, no. Why did he interview so many bad act actors like Alex Jones? How many people do I interview? Like Alex Jones? First of all, I don't interview anybody. I'm not interviewing you, am I? Nope. I'm not an interviewer. Um, I suck at that. I've kind of interviewed Ron miscavige yesterday. I talked to people and I record it. It's it. I'm not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination. Alice Joe has been my friend for 20 years. He's fucking crazy. I showed everybody how crazy he wasn't my podcast by getting them high and drunk and have them talk about inner dimensional child molesters. If you watch that and you think I'm legitimising Alex Jones and some sort of way, then you're just, you're, you're just, you're looking at things in a very cookie cutter, wet. You're deciding that this is what I've done. But a lot of people listen to you.

Speaker 5:          01:09:35       And so I think the criticism that these people have is like, people put faith in you and they assume that if you don't raise a question against something, that that means that, that you tacitly agree with what's being said and that that'll, that allows the physicians about Alex. A lot of, no, I didn't listen to the Europe. We raise questions, but we were more bullshitting than anything and having fun and he was hammered. I mean, look, people got a chance to see them. They're actually using footage of the conversation that we had against him and his custody battle because they're saying he was in Los Angeles on film smoking marijuana. He's a loose cannon and that's, that's literally being used against them. He doesn't give a fuck. Really? They asked. They asked him a question about his kid. He couldn't remember. It was op. Sorry. I had a large bowl of Chili for lunch today.

Speaker 5:          01:10:20       I can't remember. He's fucking crazy. He's crazy and he makes ridiculous amounts of money out stones. He doesn't give a fuck. He's a great guy. I swear to God. He's a great guy. He's just, he's just got a ridiculous platform and he's kind of character, but he's he, that's who he is, man. You think he's a performance artist? I think there is a part of what he does that is most certainly theater. I think anybody who doesn't see that goes out. Todd comes in and todd comes out. That's bad impression. You got to work on it. It's almost as bad as my trump impression. Fortunately, I never listened to Ellis Jones, so I don't actually know what he, I mean I see clips of him when someone shares something with me online, but like life's too short to listen to Alec's giant. Just best clips or when he gets mad and then he apologizes. I'm a Christian. I'm sorry. He comes to someone. Someone said something about him recently and he went all, I never swear. I never

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       swearing at 20 years of nurse Warren on the air, but this fucking fat like crazy. Fucking crazy on this one guy and then he's, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm children listening. This is wrong. I mean he's fucking, he's a maniac. I'm not giving him, I'm not giving him legitimacy. He already has a massive platform, arguably bigger than mine. What I'm doing is showing you what I see when I hang out with Alex Jones. People are like, why are you friends with Alex Jones? I'm like, he's a nice guy. I like him. Look, I have a friend do I argued with for a fucking hour yesterday, thinks I'm pretty sure he thinks the fucking world is flat. Yeah. That's another one that I got satellites is Eddie Bravo. Yeah. He thinks satellites aren't real. He doesn't believe in dinosaurs. He thinks dinosaurs are bull bullshit. He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs.

Speaker 4:          01:11:59       He's out to lunch. He doesn't believe in nuclear bombs. It, listen, man, you can't, you can't even hold it to the fire. It's, it's ridiculous. I don't understand his thought process, and again, I've been friends with him. As long as I've been friends with Alex Jones, I'm awake closer with Eddie, way closer. Like Ed. He's one of my best friends. He's fucking crazy. But if you talked to him about conspiracies, but if you talk to them about like mma or he's a jujitsu genius, I mean, he's like one of the very best Jujitsu instructors on the planet earth. Without a doubt.

Speaker 3:          01:12:28       I mean, this is, comes back again to the like how we can compartmentalize our minds, right? It's like a religious person who believes in the story of Jesus, but he's also otherwise super intelligent.

Speaker 4:          01:12:37       That's a perfect analogy. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, and you know, I don't know how people's brains work. I don't understand. I, you know, I've, I've, I've tried to study like people's really irrational thinking and tried it, but you know what? I worry more than anything that worried that it's contagious disease.

Speaker 3:          01:12:58       I think it is. I think it is, and this is why I'm a bit worried about way we're at culturally at the moment because I think that concern about irrationalism being contagious is not too dissimilar from my concern about a disrespect for the idea of truth and falsehood being contagious. So you know it when I was talking about the, the this analyst, this Russian journalist who was talking about the ways in which Putin and Chavez and Atawan in Turkey and the Hungarian dictator, what not dictated Hungarian president who was becoming a quad. I dictated the way that they kind of use the muddiness of the whole question of what's true or false as a way of throwing sand in the gears of the whole democratic process and sand in the gears of people's ability to kind of analyze the world and figure out what's true and false and what's important and not important that if all you're doing every day is just tweeting out like a stream of nonsensical bullshit that is neither true nor false but kind of exists in like this area of like you are trump's ego. Then I actually have found myself becoming less convinced about reliable sources of information and myself becoming more to irrational

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       ideas. Like I don't feel as confident anymore. Like it's easy because there's so much, you see so much stuff of like I'll tweet out something that the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal or The New York Times, uh, have published, all of which I regard as being upstanding publications where I have faith that the journalists are doing their best, not always perfectly, but doing their best in the long haul to tell the truth and only report facts and then people will say, oh, fake news, fake news. That is the bullshit. And they'll link to something to Alex Jones said is if there's kind of a kind of equivalence between those two things. And I have to remind myself to an actual specific thing. You're just speaking in generality. People have linked, people have told me that they believe there's no difference between the credibility of Alex Jones and the credibility of the New York Times,

Speaker 1:          01:15:05       New York Times talking about the interdimensional child molesters. Not yet, but let's give him time. Joe. It's a, its early days. It was administration times has fucked up in the past. Yeah. And they, they have strayed from unbiased journalism, which is an issue because as soon as you start doing that, as soon as you editorialize the news, you open yourself up for people who point out that you editorialize the news and then point out the fact that you're biased and they have but hold on, they have been not that that's an issue. And I think they realize that they, that has been used against them. And I think that's one of the things that they addressed when they talked about sort of reinvigorating the idea of objective journalism. And they started talking about that after the uh, the trump election after he was elected president. They talked about this a reinvigoration and this sort of re re committing themselves to, to real hard journalists.

Speaker 1:          01:16:00       That's right. I think a lot of people also had done understand the difference between the editorial page and like the opinion pages and the news section is true, but even the new section has been biased. You know, there, there have been storms in a couple of occasions been things we have a blind I think yeah they have. But as soon as you just leave open that potential, that possibility, then people go, oh, you're a bunch of left wingers. Like a lot of people think that because they got the election wrong, that means that you can't trust Paul's. He's another way in which in which they, this kind of insidious idea that nothing is trustworthy and there's no such thing as the truth or facts or you'll version of history is as good as anyone's version of history. This is another thing that Lawrence Krauss was saying on my podcast by the way, which is he thinks that there's a link between the kind of postmodern like hippie 1960s like philosopher movement of like, Hey, believe whatever you want to man. Like there is no truth, right? Like truth is all salt socially constructed and like gender is entirely socially constructed and there was no such thing as masculinity. It's all just, I don't know, some kind of capitalist story that we've all been led to believe. So I like put a flower in your hair and bust out of it and let your truth be whatever that you want the truth to be. He stays a link between that and what you might think of as being something opposite, which is

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       the hard right kind of outright trumpy sort of fake news phenomenon because both of them make the claim that there's no such thing as the truth essentially. And your truth is whatever is true for you. There were a million people and a dog. I didn't alteration. Okay. The warships were steaming towards North Korea. Okay. Trump said it. Does it matter? Terrible. This is true or not true. What's, let's unpack that one step at a time. Um, I definitely think that some of the, as we said before, some of the reasons why trump became popular are these ridiculous assertions that gender has no basis in biology. That you can be anything you want. You can be Fox. Can you know that you can, you know, you can identify with being, I mean there's, there's people that are trying to figure out whether or not trans racial is a thing.

Speaker 5:          01:18:05       Rachel Dolezal was on CNN and she was talking about the fact that race is a social construct is interesting, wasn't it? It is interesting because people don't want to accept that black people get really mad. They're getting really mad at her. They also say the same thing. Like I mean anytime worth their salt understands that race is not a genetic thing, that this is a cultural construct. And I mean I find it, I find her logic sort of hard to flow in to fault in a way is most sort of social construct. It's most certainly more solid than saying there's no biological basis for gender. That's right. There's more biological basis to six than there is to, you know, there's more sex chromosomal issue. There's an x, y chromosome that males have and if a male decides that he identifies with being a female, look, there's a boy that's running track now there's a new one, cause they've had a few of these is the one who was a girl that was a wrestler that was taking, she wanted to be a boy.

Speaker 5:          01:19:03       So she was taking testosterone and crushing all these other girls in wrestling. She won the state title in Texas, I think you mean he was a trans, whatever, whatever. But now there's a boy who's not even taking treatment who decides he identifies as a girl and he's just whooping everybody's ass and track cause he's a fucking boy. But no, he's a girl but he's not a boy. He's not a girl. We have to find a way to like separate the psychologic, the psychology from the physiology, especially in sports. Exactly. 100%, especially in combat sports. And I, I took a lot of heat because I was saying that there was a, there was a man who was a man for 30 years. It became a woman and didn't tell people that he used to be a man for 30 years and beat the fuck out of two checks before eventually came out.

Speaker 5:          01:19:43       And now when, once your out look, I say especially in professional sports, um, you have, you have, uh, uh, right, like two to say no or to say yes to compete against that person. I think if a woman wants to fight against a man, if a woman's 130 pounds and she wants to fight against a man as 130 pounds, they both agree. Do whatever you want. I think you should be allowed to. But I think that there's a big difference between who has been a man. Their whole life has said testosterone flowing through their bones, their blood, their body, their whole life, and then decides they're a woman versus a woman who was born, a woman, raised a woman, and as a biological woman her entire life, a transgender woman just is not a regular biological woman. It's this, it's, there's a difference, but saying that gets people so angry saying that a transgender woman who you can say as a woman, I say that, but saying that they're the same thing as a biological woman is just not factually true. Well was a different, they have different chromosomes. They have a different structure. The hips are built different, the shoulders are wider, the hands are big. There's so many factors.

Speaker 3:          01:20:46       That's right. This is what makes people so frustrated about the whole political correctness thing, right? That we set up trip wires and if you trigger one of those tripwires by making a claim, like the one you just made, which is that a trans woman is not exactly the same as a cis woman and non trans.

Speaker 5:          01:21:02       Well, no, I'm not using sis again. Not going to do it. Not Real. What do you wanna call them? Disease. I'll go with Z. Z. Z is the z instead of she for a trends. No, it's not. Instead of she needs a shit. Sorry, did I just triggered one on the tripwires. Did I? It's non-gender base. It is a non gender base. It's he or she for people who don't have agenda, it's what the fuck it is. And you sitting over there as, as as a male. It was an actual mail. I'm a CIS male. Yes. Yeah. Not an actual male biological male. All men have penises. I had buck angel on. Oh yeah. Who's a Trans Jans Jan who uses the term biological male. He says there's a difference between biological man. He was born a woman and then transitioned to being a man and he says, biological male, and he says that Trans people hate on him for using the term biological. Well, what does he mean by the term? It was someone who has x, y chromosome, a biological male versus him who has x, x, y, Z. I see. I thought you meant that he calls himself a biological male. People biology. Yeah, sure. He's like, you should, you should be able to differentiate without being prejudiced. It's so, I mean ha,

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       it's crazy. Crazy town. I just think that people should be able to live however they want to live their lives. And so I don't, you know, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about this, but I just wished that we were all generous enough that when people find it a little bit difficult to understand, you don't assume that they're bigoted just because it's a new concept for them. Because, and I think as you say it, this is part of what gave rise to trump. The, I mean the, the parallel that I was drawing a moment ago between like post structuralist, there is no such thing as gender and trump's fake news campaign was not so much that all the one led to the other. It was just that both, this is the point that Lawrence Krauss was making both undermine the, they both erode the idea of truth

Speaker 4:          01:23:08       and what's ironic is it, it's almost exactly the same thing that bill o'reilly said. The tie goes in the time it comes out. People push this way and then people go, fuck you. There is a biological difference and then they pushed that way and then they get, they get transphobic. I mean there's, there's a lot of people to get upset at ridiculous ideas and then they get,

Speaker 3:          01:23:28       they go overboard and go the other way. It's so stupid. Like Louis Ck has that bit of bad gay people as well. He's like, I don't understand. I don't understand why people get angry at the existence of gay people even if they're not in their lives. He's like even better. The, the gay marriage thing. Yeah, exactly. People get furious. Louie says, like I would understand if like there were a couple of guys fucking on my lawn and I had to like hose him down to get them. Or like gay people were just like touching their dicks in front of my face as I'm trying to eat my breakfast cereal. Right. But as long as they're not bothering me, I don't understand the point in getting upset about their mere existence out there. Yeah, and it's the same with trans people. I don't understand why there's this big thing about trans people.

Speaker 3:          01:24:08       I understand. It's silly what I mean. This comes to also like people who are currently obsessed with political correctness as being the biggest problem facing America today. I feel like have missed the boat. They're fighting the last year's battle. They're fighting yesterday's battle when the actual battle to fight is the day before yesterday, his battle, which is today's battle, which is a battle against bigotry, I think, which is a battle against trump, like battle against the idea of fake news, a battle against America eventually having its own pew. Putin likes strong man. Anyone who's spending all of their time doing all of their shows about how terrible political correctness is. And you know, Milo Yiannopoulos should be able to say whatever he wants, which of course he should is not I think as like well political correct.

Speaker 4:          01:24:49       Yes. Is a response to people feeling that there's an injustice. People feeling that there is bigotry and prejudice and so they go too far with it. They get ridiculous and it's also a natural human inclination to try to control other people's behavior. People like to be bossy and they like to be able to tell you what you can and can't do. They like to tell you what words you can and can't use. It's a weird thing that people do and it may be a response to the frustration that they feel legitimate frustration from actual bigotry and it makes them go overboard. It makes them go too far. Yes. It's a lack of perspective on both sides. That's a giant issue with human beings.

Speaker 3:          01:25:29       Yeah, and you know what? I think it actually was like the past few times that we've, we've gotten together and shot the shit on this show. Political correctness and the extremes of it have been a major topic of conversation. And I think justly so. But I do think that last year with the election of trump and the kind of welling up of kind of subtly anti Semitic coded racially coded language during the, the, the election campaign last year. Why do you claim rent antisemetic when jared Kushner is like his main guy. And I don't think trump has an anti semite I don't think trump hates. So is he

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       a nice romantic? A lot of people who support trump. Hmm. Right. But there's no evidence that he is right? I don't think so. No. I think he's just an old, an old white guy. I think he's an old white guy with traditional ideas about, about what made America great and those traditional ideas coincide with an America that was a lot wider and more Christian than the country that we say today. I think that's the way it becomes racially coded. Never even been a religious person. Really interesting. Isn't it? Talk about no children of God. You should be forced to suffer. Shut to feet, such a fraud. He's such a go and get your steak knives and your trump university dude. It's like, you know, he's a charlatan. Trump steaks, steaks. Amazing. Shizzy how fucking corrupt the religious right off. I haven't gotten behind him so quickly.

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       When he was, he went down to Liberty University. He gave a speech. He was like, you know the my favorite part of the Bible, two Corinthians pronounced two Corinthians. It's second Corinthians every evening. Even if you just went to, went to Bible school when you were a kid, you remember that, so they know he's a fraud. He was asked by an interviewer or what his favorite part of the Bible is. He was like, well, I'm not going to get into that kind of personal, you know, that's personal. He hadn't read the fucking Bible. He doesn't pray. He's got his own Bible going to answer. I wrote it exactly. This is where I'm at night in his underwear and he talks and somebody writes it down one day. That'll be the Bible. The Best Bible. He'd been an amazing Bible. So they're all corrupt and full of shit. Uh, the religious right for getting behind him.

Speaker 1:          01:27:33       When they always talk about how important personal faith is in that, in their candidates. What else are they going to do? They go towards Hillary. I mean, what are we going, I mean, sorry, I mean during the primary, but who else would they go with? He's going to win. They knew he was Ted Cruz didn't have a shot. He's too wormy. People see him sweat too much. It's too of weird. Easily lost the election. But what, but what I'm saying is they would rather, yeah, they would rather have Donald Trump win the election. Then have ted Cruz will lose the election on with principles, which is amazing because you now you see people saying, I wish Ted Cruz was in office. Like there's a lot of people on the left that would have been happy with Ted Cruz. Yeah. No, not me. Well, he's really anti gay. He's very anti gay and he's very smart.

Speaker 1:          01:28:13       He's extremely, you know, he was like a champion of the Harvard debating team. Apparently. I think it was Harvard. I think he's gay. I reckon. You Reckon? What do you think when you look at them? You got Gaydar, right? Yeah, I do have good guy being a gay man. Can you pick out cajuns? Yeah, I'll if you're in a room. Yup. Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good at it. Huh? What do you think really? He gives, there's a, on the, on the conservative, right? There's a fine line between slimy ass hole and closeted gay. You know what I mean? You don't think there's some connection, some, some like, well no, I'm saying they could rise or relationship. It could be, but the problem is that they never underlying root system fungus that sort of connects. They communicate via electronic using fungal. Yeah. Deep under the surface.

Speaker 1:          01:29:03       Pray the gay away as possible, but they often are. They also like, Ted Haggard is a good example. Right? You remember that guy? Yeah, he was, he seemed gay, didn't he? He had a little like his sibilance swear a little bit. S E s s list bees and gay. But I didn't get it. I don't know cause I'm like obviously not the most gay presenting person that you've ever met. So I think that work. Yeah, I don't know. It's fascinating though, isn't that present as gay? Here's part of the thing about gender as well. This is the right is it brings us back to Rachel dollars, Ireland, rice and stuff like that. Like obviously, so maybe there is some biological reason why do to or attracted to dude's tend to exhibit mannerisms that are more commonly associated with femininity. Right. Maybe a sing song. He voice I certain style of walking, Swish sashaying a swishy sort of my friends that I was talking to about the coppell.

Speaker 1:          01:30:03       Very clear. Male and female and the relation, interesting. One of them does appear gay. Like if you got him to be like, oh that's a gay guy, but the other guy, you would have to know him. Right? You wouldn't know. And so, but then so what I think if there's a kernel of biology in that, I think it's been ramped up aggressively over the past century by people also playing the role of gay in the same way that masculine dudes play the role of, you know, masculine structures will play the role of masculinity and girls will play the role of being girly and in that respect, people who point out the gender is not the same as sex or right. Like gender is a bunch of behavioral tropes that we will act out. And so it's interesting to me like when you say, why are Gay People Gay People Act Gay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       Part of it must be an act. What was theirs? Maybe to telegraph to each other maybe. Yeah. But there's also just this broad spectrum of individuals is so different. I mean there's, there's, there's masculine people that are so incredibly different than other masculine people, Feminine Women that are so incredibly different than other feminine women. I mean just people were, they vary very widely biologically, socially they, they vary by their own neurochemistry. I mean, there's people that are just almost naturally inclined to be depressed. There's some people that you could shit right in their hair and they'd be fucking happiest peaches. It's just, people are weird, man. I'm a pretty happy person. Where do you think you lie on that spectrum of happiness? I'm pretty happy. Yeah. But I worked at it. I'm pretty aware of the pitfalls of like inactivity and I'm very, I mean, I exercise a lot, but even how the ability to motivate yourself to take action is also something that you'll need to have. Yeah, I guess. But how much of that is from learned behavior? How much of that is from what, you know, the way I grew up, there's a lot of factors. Yeah. Yeah, there are, my parents did not exercise

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       at all, like fucking zero. When I was growing up. Zero. They would come home from work and drink and uh, I did. I just was like, I gotta do something with this body. This body wants to go to war. I gotta I gotta get out and run. I gotta hit a punching bag. I've got to lift some weight. I've got to do something. I was just always like, ah, like I felt like there was an engine inside of me that was revving up all the time and I had to go run it. If I didn't, I didn't get out there and push it. I didn't feel calm and it took me till I was like a teenager before I figured that out. And then once I figured that out and once I started exercising, it was like there was me pre working out and then me, it's like, oh, now I can think now. And then I realized I was a kid. I was under the influence of biology for

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       well, yeah, I mean you're lucky that you didn't channel that into drugs or, or alcohol or aggression drugs. Flora question. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       Yeah. Violence is the real worry like that. That's a giant issue with boys. And you see kids playing and I was at a party recently, a little kid's party. It was an adult party. Children's Patty. All right. Little kids. Okay. And uh, there was this one boy and this one boy has these two parents that had kids late in life. And they weren't really paying attention. They were inside drinking and this kid was fucking hyper aggressive running around, pushing kids. He hit kids. I've watched him, I watched him a call, this kid a loser and uh, you know, I had to have a conversation with the dad and I'm like, dude, you're kid is really aggressive. And he's like, he's a good kid. I'm like, yeah, I wanted it. It's so hard because you want to say, hey man, you ain't even fucking watching your kid. You read your drinking. I'm like, look, I, I saw him push his kid and him illusory. Like that never happened. I'm like, oh my God. He goes, I look, I'm trying to apologize cause his kid did something cause I'm trying to apologize for his behavior. I'm like, you're not apologizing. You're saying he's, he didn't do anything. I'm like, all right mate, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this is the case, but this is what happened.

Speaker 1:          01:34:02       What is it with parents defending their kids so much these days? If say if a parent had come up to my parents when I was little kid and told them that I'd been doing something like that, it would have been the grownups gathering together against the child in order to kind of communally raise the child. Like, Hey, my dad would not have said that he didn't do that. He will come up to me and said, did you do that?

Speaker 4:          01:34:21       This guy and his wife were both drinking. That could have definitely been a factor and there was a factor in me not pushing it because I didn't want, because first of all he, when a guy says to you, that didn't happen when you know it happened, did you are two steps away from beating the fuck

Speaker 1:          01:34:36       he wasn't there. You were there exactly what happened. How does he know that it didn't happen? And it's such a weird thing to say. We're two steps away from, well he wasn't watching this kid at all. Yeah. And His kid. First of all, he, they had to go to visit his kid because this kid hit other kids on three occasions and it's funny, he has really good grounds for believing that it never happened. It's party over

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       a course of, you know, this is over a course of a couple of hours. This kid hit three kids and so when you say to a guy that your kids really aggressive, he's like, he's a good kid. Yeah, no he's not. He's a good kid. Oh, he's a good kid. You don't even fucking know. Maybe he's a good kid who's being aggressive right now. It doesn't change what I saw, but what I'm saying is kids, especially boys, they have this thing inside of them. Some of them do, some of them don't. But you know, we very biologically, but some of them have this aggressive tendency. That's why boys like to play football. It's why boys gravitate to, or some boys gravitate towards aggressive activities. They got to get it out of their system. You got to exercise with that kid. You got to do something with them, play catch with them, run around with them. Where I'm out there, people are not meant to sit down, it'll fucking classroom and just pay attention all day to some shit they don't want to pay attention to and then go home and sit in front of the TV. And what do they do with all that energy that they put them on? Adrenaline that kept us from, you know, kept us alive, kept us from predators, kept us from invaders mean that all that stuff is biologically programmed in the human animal and we ignore it.

Speaker 3:          01:36:07       You're leading very transphobic by implying that there something male intrinsically transphobic or is it gender? I don't know. Gender Essential Ism. I think that's what it's called. Uh, no, I'm with you and this is a problem. I mean this is a problem about the, about fatherhood, right? It's something I'm thinking about, uh, about now that I'm about to become a file. I'm like, how do I run around? Take care of too. Yeah. And how do I also make sure that like they grow up with good masculine role models and people and then I give that, enable them to be the best kinds of human beings that they want to flourish into. And then you've got the whole question of adderall and Ritalin and saw on the these, my neighbor did that. My neighbor put their kid on Ritalin, one of them

Speaker 4:          01:36:44       Prozac, Ritalin, something like that. They had this kid and he wasn't a bad kid. He was just fucking ignored. The same thing. The wife, the wife was always trying to get dick from everybody. She was like flirting and everybody, she flirt with my friends, flirt with everybody and the husband is just fucking like dealing with this crazy bitch for a wife. He didn't want to be there. He would work late and this poor kid was just bouncing off the walls. It's, they put them on drugs, dogs

Speaker 3:          01:37:07       as I am. There's a, an economist called Tyler Cowen, I don't know if you know of, of Tyler. He was, um, he would have, he's the kind of guy who now that he's in his mid fifties says that he's sure that when he was younger he would have been medicated if it were, you know, if, if he were a young person today and he, and the point that he was making about that was that human psychology is complicated and there's no sort of Yin without the Yang. Right. Like the, the distractedness that he had was bad if what you wanted was for him to sit still in class and pay attention to something that he wasn't interested in. Yes. But fantastic in a whole bunch of other ways that he thinks were invaluable. Yeah. Right. Well, my best friend Sam and Australia, who is a brilliant, like soil scientist, one of the countries and possibly the world's best scientists in his field has a phd. If, if we'd been growing up, if instead of being born when we were born, we'd been born just 10 years later. What would his creative, what would have happened to his creativity if he'd been medicated in order to be able to get through class because he was always

Speaker 4:          01:38:10       distracted. Parents don't care. They want convenience, especially parents at work all day. They work all day and they come home and they want this kid to fucking behave because they're tired and they want this life that they see in movies and in television shows. They don't know what it's like to raise a human being. It's very complex and you know, especially when you're sending these fucking kids to schools that they promote these rigid ideas of how children are supposed to behave and you know, and tell you that if you don't follow the rules, you're not going to be successful. I mean how many fucking stories have you heard where teachers tell rowdy kids they're never going to amount to anything. I had a teacher tell it to me. I'll never fucking forget it. Yup. My head that as well cause she was just so dumb. She was so, she was so dominant, such a bad teacher.

Speaker 4:          01:38:53       And I was a terrible student. I mean she was certainly frustrated ms public schools. Right. But, uh, I said something and she was a black woman, had terrible accent. She, uh, had a very bad ebonics accent and I was, uh, talking to my friend and she goes, Mr Rogan, would you like to come up here and do both of these problems in front of the class? So I go, would you like me to do both of those problems? And everybody, everybody started laughing. Harla kids were like, oh shit. And so she kicked me out of class for that and I said, all I did was talk the way you talk and you kicked me out. I go, just because you're teaching a math class. Shinny, learned how to talk, shitting learned. I taught correctly for our students and she kicked me out and she, I remember said, go ahead, laugh at Mr Rogan.

Speaker 4:          01:39:39       Mr Rogan has never gonna amount to anything in life. Yeah. Unlike being a public school teacher, but I rent, it's nothing wrong with being a public school teacher. Just saying she didn't amend it very much. It's not true. It's a great job if you do it right. What I'm saying has influence over people at school. Teachers are worthless and should be executed. That's precisely the boy. So rude. First of all, you're not even American and come over and say that shit. We have public school teachers. No, of course. I love that she's saying that it's cause she's a cunt. She was not a nice, we should be

Speaker 3:          01:40:09       sizing her not for her occupation but for her constant.

Speaker 4:          01:40:12       What's a fucking horrible job man? I mean I wouldn't want to deal with me when I was 15 yeah. Who the hell wants to deal with a 15 year old boy who doesn't want to pay attention? Who doesn't give a shit about math, but you know she left a weak spot,

Speaker 3:          01:40:24       do you think? Well, it also the whole question of like how of speaking? Well, as a teacher, if you're an educator then you sort of have to have your shit together. In terms of being educated, but then that also bumps up against, are we being racist by implying that black American English is less educated than standard white English? Cause some people argue that the, that black English is just a dialect of the language.

Speaker 4:          01:40:50       Well you could argue that, but you know what the same would be held if this was, I mean this is in Massachusetts. The same will be held if it was a guy who was a teacher who had a ridiculous Boston accent and I've marked his Boston accent. Like if he said, uh, you know something about pack you fucking cat. And I was like, would you like me to pack my cat correctly? Kicked me out because of that. It's the same thing. A lot of stress. They hit him with a bid. You're mocking someone's inability to communicate correctly and it because look whether or not it's good or bad. Like you might like saying both better. You might like it and there's nothing wrong with that. Look, if you're a happy, successful person, you don't like to say both. You like to say both. What the fuck is wrong with that?

Speaker 4:          01:41:31       It's just a sound you make with your mouth. Sure. But if I can say it, if I can repeat it and you, you're so touchy about it. You kicked me out of class. We fucked up. You fucked up. You got a soft spot. That's right. She knows. Yeah. She feels, she feels insecure about it. Exactly. How big lab on this one of my first big laughs, I was like, ah, I could mock things. Yeah. But it's just, you know, she just, she's under pressure. It's terrible job not getting paid very much. And you have to be a babysitter as well as an educator.

Speaker 3:          01:42:01       Yeah. Fucking horrible. I mean there's, I had Frank Rich on my podcast on we, the people, uh, who was, who he's an executive producer on the vape and he was the co, he was, we was like the main columnist on the New York Times opinion page for about 50 from maybe almost 20 years in the 90s and the two thousands and he sort of started the New York Times. We can review section, which comes out in the Sunday paper. And these days. And he had a piece in New York magazine which was about how much empathy we should feel towards uneducated people. He was talking specifically about trump, about like trump voters because like since the election there's been quite a lot of hand wringing among progressive's about like we've been focusing too much on these issues like trans rights and gay rights and so on and, and identity politics and black lives matter and we've lost touch with the working class base.

Speaker 3:          01:42:50       Like the Democratic Party no longer speaks in a meaningful way to white working class, especially males and especially in rust belt cities, you know, in the, in, in the Midwest. And his point was actually fuck him. You shouldn't need to pay attention to them. There were a lost cause. They keep voting against their own interest by voting for people like trump and voting for republicans. Don't try to win them over and stop trying to understand them and wringing your hands about why you've lost them. It's an interesting episode. If people want, I mean obviously I'm grossly exaggerating what his actual position is, but you should, you can.

Speaker 4:          01:43:27       I can see it, listen to the other side. I could see how someone would take that stance, but I think there's just a natural inclination to go left and right with people. There's a natural inclination to react to certain right leaning behaviors by going far left and the natural inclination to go like, like how many people grow up from really a regressive religious backgrounds and then they become like really saccular. As they get older, they abandoned the religion, they become reformed Catholics. It's really common. It's really common to to see the suppression of one ideology and bounce in the other direction. If you have a parent, I mean there's a lot of people that, you know, they grow up and their parents are super hippies and then they become a conservative going to rebel against their parents. It's a really common, Yup.

Speaker 3:          01:44:11       That's what I'm always thinking about in terms of parenthood as well. Like no matter what it is that I try to fix in the way that my parents raised me, where I think they could've done it better. That's just going to swing in the opposite direction and then my kids are going to do the opposite

Speaker 4:          01:44:22       because they, because you always think that your parents did an imperfect job, right? Fighting yesterday's [inaudible] does an imperfect job. It's impossible to be perfect. You're a fucking human being. There's no perfect human beings. They've never existed. Jesus said the sweet baby Jesus, the Dalai Lama's not perfect. How about fucking Gandhi? Gandhi used to sleep with a bunch of girls naked in his room. He was probably a freak, like Gandhi was most likely a freak and he just, they just kept it under wraps because he was Gandhi like, do you know the story? Used to sleep with naked teenagers.

Speaker 3:          01:44:51       Yeah. There's also weird things about, I mean human and also Mother Teresa have weird things in their personal lives do well. I don't think it was sexual, but I think there was a lot, there were a lot of questions about like her ethical dealings in terms of the Mother Teresa Foundation and where her money went. And like what did it go too well for his thought. She didn't think that it was very, she didn't think it was a good idea to empower young women.

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       What have you. W We found out that all our money went to a warehouse filled with dildos. Why thought fuck. Like she did a lot of good but she also bought a lot of Dildos, fucking gigantic stacks of, oh wait, she could use the door kick start these fucking Harley Davidson powered vibrators. I love it. Uh Yeah. Well I mean the people are not perfect and most charitable organizations are criticized for spending far too much on infrastructure and you know, the administrative costs and then you find out how much money actually goes to the charity. Like you just have an organization where you're giving people jobs and by the way you also do some good.

Speaker 3:          01:45:55       Awesome. Good. It's interesting cause like whenever I give to charity, I always try to pay attention to how many, how many overheads they have and how much money is being spent on Admin and so on. But then it was actually I think will macaskill or someone who's involved in the um, like the, the life you can save kind of like give well movement, which is like rational. Is it practical altruism or rational altruism with effective altruism? That's how podcasts, yeah. Yeah, he's great. He was an, and they were saying in actual fact it does take quite a lot of administration to make a dollar work. Well of course. So if you just look at the ones at the charities with the lowest overhead, then that it doesn't necessarily actually mean that they're doing the best work in the field because it might cost 40 cents out of every dollar to make sure that you're targeting the remaining 60 cents in a way where you'll get actually 60 cents of value rather than a place that only has a 15% overhead. But then the remaining 85 cents are all being on bullshit projects

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       that don't have any measurable. And then success. It's signed the complete other end of the spectrum. You have the Clinton Foundation, which was a ruse. I mean, it was not essentially a prestige play wasn't, it doesn't exist anymore. Does not exist any going under. Yeah, they're closing it down. Hmm. Isn't that a fact? Pull up police pull that up. I'm pretty sure they, they said they were shutting it down, but I mean Bill Clinton would take hundreds of thousands of dollars and speak at these charitable events. Like people would jet, they would spend a gigantic chunk of their budget to have Bill Clinton come and speak and he would take all of it. He would take all the money. He wouldn't, we didn't think of it fast. Yeah. So he would, he would take these gigantic donations from people and then he would speak and get paid hundreds of thousand dollars speaking phase of crazy. I mean, even the fact that Hillary Clinton was taking speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and did not think that that would look bad in, she didn't give a fuck.

Speaker 5:          01:47:47       So stupid. No, I, well, I think now she gives a fuck. Well, you know what? Bernie Sanders drilled that and I'm so glad he did. But look, it's bribery. It's a loophole. There's a little bowl and it's bribery. Nobody wants to pay to hear her talk. Get the fuck out of here. She's a terrible speaker. She's not Louis C k. You know what I'm saying? I mean, this is not Chris Rock. We're talking about this is, she's not a good speaker, but the whole painted here, this is the whole thing about these I, late Clinton global initiative to shutdown lays off 22 as donations, but this is the Washington Times. That's a, that's a no, no, no. Right wing rag. How dare you check. Um, that's, that's not the only place that I saw it. I saw it in a lot of places. They're shutting it down at the top.

Speaker 5:          01:48:28       The top click is snipes. So that'll tell level. That's the conspiracy theory of the whole story about snopes though. Do you know about the guy who runs snopes? Snopes is run by a fucking Kook. The Guy, the guy who runs snopes left his wife, he started with his wife, left his wife, married a prostitute, a prostitute as a website where she was as recently as two years ago, was getting reviewed for her prostitute work. She's asked court and there they both have a clear left wing bias clear like, like he's, she's been involved in, well, I mean show me, show me any snips, pages that say that something is true when it's not or the sites. Not necessarily that it's true or it's false. There's these ambiguous areas where they always lean left and that's what people have said about snopes. It's kind of tricky.

Speaker 5:          01:49:17       Okay, but it's not, it's, it's simple. It's not like this computer controlled objective reality and understand Isley. Politifact is also, it also gets accused of being left wing because right wing people who are full of shit don't like being cold out on it. Fake News. Yeah, exactly. It's not, it's not actually, I mean I've, I haven't seen anything on snips that is uh, that is questionable. Even if the guy's an asshole, this CNN thing, when she pointed to the CNN reporter, you are fake news. Oh well this is, this is that me of living in a

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       banana republic reminded me of living under in Venezuela. Fake News. Yeah, you are faking like just that statement. What the fuck does that even mean? You're not news. This is a goddamn person to you in vain. You are fake news. Fake news also, but so effective people loved it when you're, you know, the thug life meme, the sunglasses chopped down. I saw that a bunch of those for him when he said that you are fake news. I mean did you guys were in the states when you were like kids we like, did you have like I know you why you said you are, but what am I like that kind of bullshit. Basically what he's saying like people accuse, no, you like he was elected on the, on the back. He would be elected by very, very narrow majorities in a few key swing states that had been inundated with bullshit stories on facebook that were coming out of eastern Europe with Russian funding and expand, exploding all of these fake bombshell expos. A's is about how Hillary Clinton, how the FBI prosecutor who was looking into Hillary Clinton had been found dead and all this sort of stuff. There was actually fake news then the way the term came into public public consciousness last year. And now anyone who criticizes the administration, he just does. He just pulls a, I know you are, you said you are, but what am I a trick and says, Whoa, that's not fake news. Your fake news you face is fake news.

Speaker 4:          01:51:15       What did you think about when Julian assange, um, implied that that young man who worked for the DNC, who was assassinated, he was shot in the back. They tried to say it was a robbery. Like they left his wallet, they left his watch, they left his phone, they'd left all his money. That didn't take a thing from him and they shot him at four o'clock in the morning in the back. Julian assange was insinuating that this young man had been the source of the DNC leaks. That implied that though, that show that Hillary Clinton and the DNC conspired against Bernie Sanders in the primary, and you don't really hear about that anymore. I mean, that guy's dead. He's dead and there's no investigation. There's no, no one was found guilty. No one was tried. There's no, there's no, no one's looking. That guy was killed.

Speaker 3:          01:51:59       Well, I'd like to look into it. I think [inaudible] has kind of lost credibility by essentially becoming a conduit for the Kremlin. Like all of know wikileaks, we all know that the, I mean people insecurity. So every, anytime I talk about this, people are going to respond and say, Oh, you're just buying the security services. Align years believing what the NSA and the CIA want you to believe. Okay. Yeah. I'm basically taking on faith the conclusions of security agencies here in the United States, multiple to get more than a dozen different security agencies also confirmed by the Brits, by British, the British secret service all believe say that they have good reason to believe that the Kremlin was behind the hacks and that wikileaks released was, it must've been in cahoots with the Kremlin because otherwise how it, how did they release the DNC was there could have been

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       many people that were trying to have, but dealing with like can see fingerprints on things. They know how these things work. They can see the back doors. So do you think that Julian assange was lying and saying that guy was a part of the leaks? I think could have been one of the conduits. I mean, he could have been one of the people that leaked it to Russia in the first place. Uh, that's possible. Yeah, that's possible. I just don't know why I would be trusting Julian assange about any of this because he says that it didn't come from Russia. Well, the other thing that I would worry about with Julian Assan, she's at this poor fuck has been trapped in the embassy in London for so long and he can't get out. I think his head is, I think he'd be, he's got a problem with his head these days.

Speaker 5:          01:53:26       How could he not Pammie's back? Pamela Anderson makes us sixth visit to Lover Julian assange as she brings Vegan cheeseburgers to the Ecuadorian embassy for the wikileaks foundation. What Pamela Anderson is banging Giulia massage. Odd, powerful Julian massage. Wait a minute, hold on a second. Julien is trying to free the world. I love him for this. Pamela Anderson reveals her feelings for a sausage in rambling blogs on sex and faking orgasms. Baywatch actress and model 49 is said to have been dating wikileaks founder has been stuck inside. He's been stuck inside the embassy in Knightsbridge since 2012 with saunders had been stuck inside posters too big for him to get stuck. And I'm saying, well I guess he's done well for himself for a Pale pasty Australian who's never, um, would you just say, Jamie, she's been visiting him there and whatnot. For how long? I last couple of months at least.

Speaker 5:          01:54:18       She's like a pretty good when you cover up and put her all in black, how old would pedal or Anderson Beta 49 we just read it. Oh, I see. Okay. He's 45 she's 49 she's an older woman. Dark and holder and comes around. Doesn't that like a fuck? Yeah, I mean time wins and all of us. Yeah. I looked like shit compared to when I was 25 there's nothing you can do about everyone does. Nothing you can do about it. It just beats you directly. We'll get to a point with science can reverse that. It's on the way 100%. They've already done it. And what people would pay to be able to look and feel like they did when they were 25 well, you know that Peter Teal guys are already getting done blood put into a system. He said, I don't trust the guy. Him and Julie and a son should, should meet up and create some little underground implants and trust him.

Speaker 5:          01:55:01       He's selling something fishy about him. He's a big trump guy, which in itself in and of itself is not bad, but he's such, he's a very smart billionaire. Trump guy. Billionaire gay trump guy. Yeah. Weird. And also that whole, you know, suing Golkar until it went under. Well he's very, he's a violative prick. Well they had a common, I mean they outdid him and then they went after Hulk Hogan and then the guy said that he would release a sex tape of a child, you know, if he could get away with it. You remember that? Yeah, I do. And I, it doesn't condone them, but I don't like setting up a precedent where very, very rich people can just, cause this wasn't the only thing that he was suing them about. He was basically just throwing lawsuits at them that, that so, so fast that they couldn't keep their head above and

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       they went down to our biggest, I mean, how can you eventually the person's going to win a lawsuit. I don't like the idea that media companies can just be constantly sued. They went after a creep. I mean, well, they were creeps and they went after him, but they went after a rich guy. Yeah. Well, we live in, we live in America, which has a first amendment. They're supposed to be able to do that without, without being sunk. But should they be able to reveal details about his life that he doesn't want public? Let's let the First Amendment is, you're allowed to a set of first amendment that you're allowed to go after. Someone like say if somebody decides to just go after you, you're not even a public person. Like keep me. Is he probably as a public person, how has he public, because people know who he is.

Speaker 1:          01:56:22       I don't actually know whether that was part of the, um, part of the defense is crazy shit about you, unfortunately. Yes. Because that's what freedom is. Like. I don't think that, do you think that America would be a better place if fantastically wealthy people could, uh, launch an endless string of lawsuits? Whether or not they're legitimate at media companies that aren't like, it's a good question. It really depends on what that media company did and why they did it. I mean, I'm no fan of gawkers tawdry like I didn't consume any of that stuff. I don't know. I didn't believe in adding paypal. I don't think that they were right. But what it says about his character is what I find troubling it much like trump. I just don't, I basically don't like vindictive people who the moment you cross them, they then spend the rest of their lives and fortune like coming back to hunt you down.

Speaker 1:          01:57:13       I don't think that's a mature character trait. I see your point. I see your point. Um, the question would be what if they cost him money and they profited from it financially and then he will not leave. Cry me a fucking Ribeye. He comes, not the best example. It's not the best example because you know, there's nothing wrong with being gay. She had just been out in the first place. Right. But that's his choice, isn't it? Yeah, it is his choice. And I don't really believe in adding paypal, but on the other hand, like just grow up. Like I shoot them over that and he just decided that they were constant who's got to go out and get sued them about that. But that didn't work. And then he sued him about, he sued them on multiple occasions. If you've got infinitely deep pockets you can ruin, you will find a way to ruin people by dragging them through the quotes.

Speaker 1:          01:57:56       She should have been able to bank roll hall Cogan did you think Hulk Hogan had a legitimate gripe? Yeah, I think so. Right. I mean cause wasn't, wasn't that the case that he didn't realize that he was being 100% of the time. Yeah. You shouldn't be able to have a video of you having sex with somebody that you didn't know it was being taken splashed all over the Internet. Yeah. And then profit from it and then profit from it. So the real question was should he have been able to bankroll exactly. That's right. Yeah. Or or or should they be some limit to the number of like lawsuits because again, you would want people to be able to bankroll cases that they care about deeply but maybe not three or four completely unrelated cases all against the same side. Right. That's where it gets weird. But isn't this the like life in general? Yeah, it's slippery. Yeah. There's, there's,

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       I mean it's like we were talking about with abortion, like what is it? Is it killing a baby or is it a medical procedure? Just agree that it's both that like that. Not to send why there is, especially in this country, like it's so, so polarizing here. Oh come on man. I ain't know Dawson Dawkins and tweeted something about it that there was nothing that people like a human embryo was a essentially the same thing as a pig embryo was like ridiculous comparison to abortion looks like because the religious right. We'll always be crazy about the things that it's crazy about and people will always get offended on twitter when Richard Dawkins tweet something that's unpopular. By the way, I have an interview with him coming up. If, if so if you don't, let me just plug, if you don't subscribe to way that people live in search for we the people, all one word in your podcast App, uh, I'll be talking to Sam Harris tomorrow, which I'll get released in a couple of weeks.

Speaker 3:          01:59:38       And don't shout at me for not releasing it immediately like you did last time twitter and we'll have some not to shout and we'll have some good and that's exactly right. It's true. I'm going to sue their asses and then drag him through course. Uh, and I'll be talking to joe about the be doing, launching a little, um, ask me anything kind of dominates. And so I had, I did an [inaudible] with Dawkins had a stroke, stroke. He's great, he's fine, he's doing well. Well, the stroke did not affect his, his cognitive function. It did affect his ability to sing, which is interesting. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. And it's, so there are a few motor functions that I think it's affected, but it didn't. Yeah, as you say, it didn't affect his cognitive, so that'll be being released. So, so follow at WTP underscore live on twitter and on the school they'll find it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:20       Just find a way with paypal. Anyway, so what Richard Dawkins was saying and his people are going to be angry at him on twitter regardless of what he says, but I still affirm that in the state it's in the states, the conversation around abortion is uniquely different from the way that it is in Europe and in Australia. It's much more of a, it's just much more of a full pipeline issue and I wonder whether in hindsight it wouldn't have been better for row the way not to actually have been decided by the Supreme Court that way. What? Well, just because I know people are going to have, you don't have this as well. You fucking CIS gender piece of Shit. I believe. I believe in what their surrogate mom leave and abortion rights, but I don't believe that it's that you can find in the constitution of the United States a right so inalienable that the Supreme Court, like where is it in the constitution.

Speaker 3:          02:01:13       The Supreme Court said there's a right to privacy, therefore there's a right to abortion because we don't want to interfere in women's affairs. But that presupposes that the embryo isn't a human, you don't have the right to privacy to kill somebody. Right. I mean, if I go into a room, my right to privacy, it doesn't extend to me get being able to get away with killing a baby. The question of whether or not it's a baby is the relevant question. Right. That's not addressed at, you know, in, in row. So I think that it should be legal, but I think that it should be legal through the legislative process. I think that is a legitimate democratic aspiration for people to be able to, and if it means that it does, it's not legal in Alabama because a majority of people in Alabama don't want it. I don't think the founding fathers would have a problem with that.

Speaker 4:          02:02:01       Well, there's a strong amount of large amount of people that don't want men talking about this at all, that they will follow. You should be able to discuss this. Yes, this is the problem. That is one of the main problems and female issue. Remember as well woman being upset that a man with no stake in the game is stepping up and saying that a woman should or should not be able to have an abortion?

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       Well, why? I mean how do I have stake in the game of whether or not, for example, murder should be legal.

Speaker 4:          02:02:29       Well, okay, this is not that. This is, this is something different. This is someone in might be to you, but it might not be to them if it's just having like, okay, here's the morning after pill. Is that the same as an abortion?

Speaker 3:          02:02:46       I don't care because I don't think there's anything wrong with abortion. It, no, I don't think there's any wrong.

Speaker 4:          02:02:50       Well, the shutter is if it's a nine month old baby, the baby's in there and it's about to come out the next day, decided to open her up and stabbed in the head.

Speaker 3:          02:02:57       This is what I'm arguing for is that is a kind of incrementalism which you were just alluding to. Right. It's not a black or white thing. Why can't we? Why can't we all appreciate that it's both because it's become so polarized in the United States that both positions are bullshit and people on both sides know that both positions are bullshit. It's bullshit to say that it is just a women's health issue and has no ethical implications whatsoever. Even if, as you say, you're talking about cutting a woman open at nine months and stabbing in the embryo in the head. It's also bullshit to say that the instant an egg is fertilized, that is a person that should have all of the rights to life than an adult should have and then it's murder to kill a blastocyst, but smaller than the size of the head of a pin positions a stupid, this is an incremental situation.

Speaker 3:          02:03:44       Life evolves. It grows, a fetus grows. It becomes a human being. I mean, Peter Singer, the great philosopher, also an Australian says that under certain conditions, infanticide, the killing of babies should be legal and could be ethical. While he's an animal nut, he loves animals more than, but he makes a legitimate point, which is that, you know, why does it make a difference? One day after the baby is born, I suppose you've got a premature baby that's born four weeks early. Uh, in fact, now we can already make babies survive at right at right around the point of viability, which is where abortion is still on the, on the fringe of. So say you've got a 22 or 23, 24 week old, a baby, not, not we called baby you timing from the, from the moment of inception conception that could live outside the womb. Right? But the moment it gets born, it becomes murder to kill it. But you

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       could have killed exactly the same organism with exactly the same future and exactly the same prospects and exactly the same life if it was inside the womb and of states. Uh, well on underbrush, on Roe v Wade, I'm not talking about late term, I'm talking about the point of viability beat Roe v Wade state, uh, the viability time. Uh, it's, it's been interpreted as being like that 20 to 24 week. But this is specifically say that I don't, I don't think, I don't know whether or not that comes out of the actual ruling where they were writing it in Roe v Wade, but I do know that that is the way that it's been interpreted by lower courts since then. But, but maybe they actually spelled out the number of weeks. Either way, you know, he's pointing to a, to a legitimate conundrum. It was sort of moral hypocrisy, slippery issue.

Speaker 1:          02:05:23       It's not simple black or white. Right. And the idea that we shouldn't be allowed to think and talk about the moral quandary of this because we can't have babies. Well, I'm not agreeing as silly. I'm not agreeing to that. No, I know what I'm saying. That is an argument that women want to take it because they feel, they feel like there's this unjust sort of male dominance on the female reproductive system. Look when I see a bunch of white men, white old men sitting in Congress making rules against women, predominantly young women, predominantly young women of color who are in areas that have less the least amount of access, which siphoned legally women of color. How so? Because safe legal abortions are more difficult to obtain in places like rural Alabama than they are in places like New York City. Yeah, but there's a lot of white people, Rural Alabama.

Speaker 1:          02:06:16       I don't necessarily think it's a racial issue as much as the poverty issue, especially like things like planned parenthood and shutting down planned parenthood's. They're just going to affect people that don't have much money. Yup. Who had disproportionately people of color as well. Disproportionately in terms of the actual numbers of human beings are intended to percentage wise a lot. The actual emotional lives of human beings. It's not right, but you can understand how it would look bad. If you're a black woman ad people of color to that, it accentuates the issue. It makes it even more problematic. It makes it more of a big left wing progressive issue. Right. That can't be argued against. Do you think the is discrimination against people of Color? Oh, don't want to do that. It's people, but do you think that the optics would look as bad if all of the old white men who were writing the laws were black?

Speaker 1:          02:07:00       I think it all looks bad. I don't think I would look as bad. The idea, hold on a second. You're saying that if old white men make these issues, it doesn't look as bad. Know what I'm saying? It looks worse. Bad as possible. It looks worse than it was black and men were making this issue against all poor people because old white men just seem to drip privilege because they use every single checkbox they've got going for them. They both male, they're white and they're all sure argument. Anyway, they're tortured arguments. Thomas, you don't think it looks weird when Clarence Thomas Votes against abortion? Yeah, I do. Yeah, so there you go. But I mean, my

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       point, my point is simply yes.

Speaker 6:          02:07:38       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:07:39       I take the optics as being a bad thing. I think the optics are worse if it's white people and if it's black people, but I'm happy to, I'm happy to yield that point to concede that point if that's the sticking one. The point is we have to be able to have conversations about anything without allowing our identities to prevent us from being able to think. To ponder that I came on this show was because I was getting into an argument with an activist about whether or not I had a right to have an opinion about whether or not Stephen Colbert had been racist. Right. And she was claiming that I didn't, I didn't have a right to have a conversation about it because I'm a white man.

Speaker 4:          02:08:20       Well that was just the way she tried to get out of the argument. You know the whole thing before that was her not understanding the joke and she didn't want to own up to the fact that she didn't understand the joke. And then when you sort of explained it to her, she was using the you as a white man thing. They try to deny your opinion, don't you think? It happens all the time. I mean just exactly what you're saying. I think we're, we're both on the same page here in that I think we both agree that you should absolutely be able to have a conversation about this. The question is, should a man be able to decide what a woman can and can't do with their body and should we be able to make the laws? But you just smuggled in the term with her body.

Speaker 4:          02:08:57       Well, it is a baby. If it's a blastocyst and it is in our body, right? She's a blessing to her body, right? So that is a decision that we're talking about that. So when it gets to be an embryo or fetus along the way, somewhere along the way, it ceases to be just her body, but an unrelated male human being. When should that person be able to make a decision and should a male human being be able to make a decision at all? Because if you can make a decision about the embryo or a fetus, can you make it about the blastocyst? Like when can you decide and why should a man be able to make that decision in the first place? Because he's got, because he's got a brain as well and we're rolling and you deciding trolling someone's body, you are talking about controlling a body. No. Which a woman with a black side of her, you tell her she can't take care of that blastocyst and remove it. She must make it viable and bring it to

Speaker 3:          02:09:45       birth. We're talking about when a homosapien comes into existence. That's a philosophical and ethical questions.

Speaker 4:          02:09:50       No, it's not. If you're telling me framing it as being, if you're telling a woman's body, no, no, no, because we're talking about the rights. Giving someone a ride or stopping them and controlling them. Yeah. If you're talking about a blastocyst inside a woman's body, yeah, and you're a man and you decide, you don't even know this woman. You decide by your moral argument and judgment she should not be able to terminate that blastocyst. Then you are deciding what she can do with her body.

Speaker 3:          02:10:12       No. You're deciding what she can do to the blastocyst. It's in her body. It's inside her buddy. You sure? It's also inside her body when it's nine one

Speaker 4:          02:10:19       it's all so you're, so you're saying a man unrelated man should be able to have input on whether a woman should not determine it. A blastocyst saying,

Speaker 3:          02:10:27       saying that the democratic institutions of the state should be able to decide that

Speaker 4:          02:10:32       mean talking about democratic, we're

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       talking very specifically about a man. What are you talking, being able to decide if it's a dictatorship, then I don't agree with that. I do believe that people should be able to, I think this is something that people ought to be able to vote on. Yes. I personally again, favor abortion rights, but I don't think that the, I don't think that the gender of the person who is voted into power by the voting public is relevant in terms of whether or not the voting public thinks that embryos are human beings, but you don't think that? I just think, I don't think that embryos have a right to life, but I don't, I don't think that it makes sense to say that an embryo is just the woman's body. We're not talking about an embryo. We're talking about the entire process, right? The entire process of conception to birth and that somewhere along the way.

Speaker 5:          02:11:15       What do you like and then you arguing that if, if there, if there are males in positions of power and congress that they should have to abstain from ruling. I'm sure shit in male justices on the supreme court have to abstain from voting on abortion cases. I'm arguing that it's problematic when a man decides who can not get pregnant, decides when a baby is actually a baby, so it shouldn't be allowed to vote for. I'm not saying that I'm the same candidates that are antiabortion. Don't you think it's problematic that a guy should decide whether it, like say if you're a hardcore where I've already said it looks bad, optics is luck, looks man, but what does a couple of medic main other than looks? Well, it's not. It's a, it's a huge issue. It's not looks, it's a huge issue that someone who cannot get pregnant decides that another human being, that they're totally unrelated to can't make the decision that five cells that are bundled together must be brought to life.

Speaker 5:          02:12:10       They think that those five cells are a person. Well, they don't even know this. I mean, you're just a lot of cells. They don't even know this person. They don't know this for wash. They have any power over this person and why should they have any power or his to determining what are they controlling a person's body and when are they saving a baby? Well, that's precisely the, the question, isn't it? Right. That is the question. Should they, should a male have the right to determine whether or not a woman can murder her newborn baby? That's a good question. I say no.

Speaker 5:          02:12:39       At least she consistent. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think anybody should be able to murder a baby. I don't think a man should have the right. I think we, society as a society collectively know. You were just, I thought you were just saying that you'd, you'd think that a man should not be able to prevent a mother from killing her baby. No, that's, I said that wrong. What I mean is no, because that is what you're saying with regard to the abortion. You're saying that a man shouldn't have a, should not have the right to prevent a woman from killing her baby. Very. When we interrupt each other it's not going to work. Okay. I, I know what you're saying and I know that you're saying that we should all have a stake in this. We shall be able to discuss this. I just think that when you talk about like, especially like a blastocyst eventually becoming an embryo, we have to agree in some way, shape or form that you and I don't have a stake in it. We're not going to get pregnant. No, it's a a way, it's a way

Speaker 1:          02:13:31       bigger issue for a woman than it is for Matt. Yes, so we agree. We agree that it's a way bigger issue for a woman that I should be able to discuss it. I just think we both agree that you should be able to discuss it, should be able to debate. Where I'm coming from here is that I feel like we use identity politics to deprive other people of standing to discuss questions that are actually universal because they're moral questions. And I think we all have one thing that I tried to do as much as possible as understand where people who I disagree with, uh, coming from. Uh, and I know you do that as well. So I am pro abortion rights, but in order for me to understand where people who detest abortion are coming from, it's necessary for me to make the sort of leap of empathy and logic into their camp and see things from the way that they see them, which is that the instant egg is fertilized for them.

Speaker 1:          02:14:26       That becomes a sacred, a sacred question of a new life where it's no longer about the woman's body. It's now a moral and ethical question that we're all involved in because we're all involved in what our culture is allowed to do and who it's allowed to kill and how it's allowed to kill them. So it becomes a bit more like a death penalty question where you might say, well, I'm never going to be up for the death penalty because I'm never going to do anything that would require that would put me on death row. So what standing do I have to be in favor or against the death penalty? That's sort of a moot question. Like we're all in the society together. We'll have to figure out what's right and wrong and if we've got a brain, we should have conversations about what's good or bad and the fact that I'm unlikely to be in a specific scenario, it doesn't actually really give me less standing to have a conversation about it or even to write laws about it.

Speaker 1:          02:15:10       If people vote me into a position where I can write laws about it. Well, I certainly think it does when you're talking about a blastocyst, I certainly think it does. When you talk about the argument of conception and when something becomes alive. So let me ask you this. When do you think abortion should be legal? Do you think it should be legal up to nine months or these things should be cut off period? I think it should basically be legal all the way up to nine months. And I probably agree with Peter Singer that maybe, maybe it's occasionally okay to kill by Biz. So you, wow. So you think that a viable baby inside a woman's body at nine months old, she's fully pregnant. As long as that baby doesn't come out, she should be able to kill it. Well, I'm saying even if it does come out, maybe because I'm evil, that's murder a baby.

Speaker 1:          02:15:57       Well, religious people think that you think that because they think that blast assistant blastocyst about religious people. I'm talking about you. Yeah, I don't. I think it's obvious that the process of going from an egg into a Joe Rogan is such a long and incremental passage that I don't see any reason why 20 weeks or 22 weeks or even vaginal birth is like the absolute moral cutoff I would watch. What you think though, that that's weird that you have this like really rigid opinion on it. I don't have any rigid opinion. You could kill a baby. You don't think that's rigid? No, cause I'm absolutely open to being convinced out of that. It's just I happened to read a book by paid us sing or about that. And so he sort of convinced me, I mean what you would have, that you should be able to kill a baby when it's born.

Speaker 1:          02:16:45       Well, that they would be systems in place that would like, that would help mothers. I don't think that it should be, I sort of agree with Bill Clinton's old framing that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, right? That you should have as many opportunities for people not to get pregnant in the first place. Widespread contracept contraception, widespread sex education. Uh, and that this should not just be a form of birth control. On the other hand, if people find themselves in a horrible pickle and that I know of how to get out of it, you think you should be able to hit the baby with a rock? I used to do it. He has a gun. I didn't really, yeah. I don't know, Joe. It sounds pretty horrible, doesn't it? It does, but again, you can't get pregnant. I can't get pregnant, so that's true. Pete.

Speaker 1:          02:17:33       I could feel my kids three holes. They're getting furious at us right now for even discussing it because we can't get pregnant. They're wrong. They're wrong. But you're right. No, I'm right that I should be able to talk about it, but I don't know what the answer is. You definitely should be able to talk about it, but it should be able to kill a baby with a rock. Yeah, probably. Nah, probably not. When I talk about that, I'll never be on death row and maybe that's how I get on death killing my children. It's so evil and unsympathetic and un-empathetic paying a blastocyst is the same journal it is, but you don't see that little fucker last assistance as long as it would have to have like reading glasses on. Do you look at it at the head of it? As long as you put a comforter over the baby so you can't see what's happening.

Speaker 1:          02:18:16       I think what we're talking about is a really complicated subject and I think it's one of the reasons why people like to box it and put it into this yes or no black or white because it's so complicated. You really sit back and think that hey, if you have an abortion at, you know, four weeks, five weeks, six, when does it have fingers? Yeah. Why does it have a heartbeat? When is it? Okay. And it's also incredibly fraught with trip wires, right? I mean, people are not going to be with me, mason, that you should be able to kill a baby and people are not going to be happy with you saying it should be able to kill a blastocyst. But I think more people will hate my position. Um, if it even is a position, well, when does a blastocyst, is it that the moment of conception, like how much time do you have? It's almost like a race to kill the baby. We need, well, some people don't think you should even be able to use contraception. Well, that's right. And also like this is one of those things were a bit like pedophilia. Uh, it's, it's a subject where it's not really possible. Like it's so it raises passions. So immediately look at what happened to Milo Yiannopoulos when he was talking about his pedophilia stuff. Right. Well, he was also talking about his own personal experiences and framing

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       them in a positive way. Yeah. And even saying that he was a sexual Predator last we said on my podcast when he got on the other podcast when he was on the drunken peasants podcast, that's where it get got more weird because then he started framing it in a different way and saying that he thinks that there is a lot of positive benefits to a young man. Like, uh, I shouldn't say young man, a boy having a relationship with a man sexually that can help them and that there's positive benefits to being molested as a young boy.

Speaker 3:          02:20:00       I think that's obviously a horrible thing to say.

Speaker 4:          02:20:03       I think what was going on was he was trying to rationalize his own sexual abuse. Hmm. I really do. I mean, I think in no way, shape or form is it comfortable for a young boy to be sexually abused by an older man. And I think that in this process of rationalization he's created this way that's empowered him. And he's also rationalize that he was the Predator and he keeps saying that and joking around about it, but he was the attain those, I think he's a victim and I think his, his, he's a very strong, smart guy and I think a lot of his intelligence as allowed him to use his perception of that event to sort of shape it into a way that benefits him.

Speaker 3:          02:20:52       Yeah, right, right. I mean the, I was on a TV show in Australia where there was a question of whether or not we should be naming and shaming sexual offenders, sexual predators or people who've been convicted of sex crimes and in the meeting before we went on air because it's a live show, I raised the point that like I think the more sort of interesting and controversial angle here is what a bloody horrible nightmare it would be to be born being sexually attracted towards infants. Right now this is in no way to diminish the monstrosity that is pedophilia. I think it's the worst thing that you can do to abuse the trust of children who are too young to know any better, but it's surely no walk in the park like the reason I'm not a pedophile, it's not because I'm a good person, it's because I have no attraction towards children.

Speaker 3:          02:21:44       Right? Imagine if the only way that you could express yourself sexually and find fulfillment in life was by torturing another human being. Like you're basically a form of, I don't want to use the wrong word here, but a form of, it's a form of psychopathy in some way in the sense that like a psychopath can only get fulfillment by doing something that's awful. So the job is to try to figure out how to stop the psychopath from doing something awful. I'm not saying that pedophiles, the psychopaths, but you can see the analogy where if your only way of finding fulfillment in life is to rape children, then let's address how to figure out how to stop you from doing that thing rather than demonizing you as a monster, even if you don't do it. Yeah, for me to even say that, a lot of people are going to push back on that as well, and it's a very similar thing to where I'm just trying to figure out in my head what makes the most sense to me. And as you say, it's got to be some kind of a spectrum of like it can't be black and white either on abortion or on something like pedophilia. But the moment you start having conversations like this shit's going to explode because people are very, very, very strident. Like you've got to protect the babies. Like you know, going to protect the children. Yes, I understand that. But does that make it impossible for us to have conversations about it?

Speaker 4:          02:22:53       Right. That's the issue is should you even be allowed to have a conversation about it and should you have a rigid black or white view of this and if you are and well, here's the real question. First of all, we don't know what causes someone to be sexually attracted to children. And we don't know how many of those people, but there's a significant amount who are actually molested themselves. I mean that's a huge factor in, in child abuse. So what, what causes that? I mean is it, and here's how to, and even more fucked up throughout history, some of the greatest minds have been pedophiles, really. Sure. Socrates, Plato. I mean you can go back through history. They were all fucking young kids. Well then you had the Greeks were like that when the Romans many, many ancient culture

Speaker 3:          02:23:36       that was, I think that was adolescents though, right? They will fucking right

Speaker 4:          02:23:40       fucking 12 year olds, like [inaudible] was talking about pedophilia and where you're talking about babies, which I think is probably even more rare. Someone fucking young boys. Yeah. But it's, it's a very bizarre part of our human history. Very bizarre. And it makes you wonder how much of that sexual abuse gets somehow or another transferred from a child being abused to that child growing up, becoming an adult and becoming an abuser themselves. What it, is it a cancer of ideas? Is it a dizzy, almost like a sexual disease that gets spread from perpetrator to victim? The victim becomes perpetrator, makes new victims.

Speaker 3:          02:24:21       Well, do you think it's the same act now as it was back then? Because it's more accepted back then it back then. So I wonder if, I wonder if it wouldn't have been less, I dunno, maybe it's not less bad. I'm trying to think. I'm talking, I'm talking now only about people who are sexually immature. Right? So like someone who's like a 15 year old catwalk model, let's just, let's assume that it's a woman who's walking down the catwalks of Milan and Paris and has what she thinks is a consensual relationship with a 25 year old fashion designer that's against the law and it's regarded as being deeply on ethical in our current society happened all the time. And other societies. Yeah. Um, there's no, I'm not saying that I think that the law should be changed. I dine, I think it's good to have, have laws against these things and I don't think that it's ethically defensible for people who are significantly older, um, to assume that the person who is still kind of evolving and still coming of age is capable of giving proper consent.

Speaker 3:          02:25:18       Well, it's illegal if to just three years older. That's where it gets really, well that is weird. That's chapel I think a week older. Yeah, exactly. If they like 17 and 51 weeks and the other person's 18 and one day it's illegal. That's stupid. There's a Romeo and Juliet clause that some countries have. Like I think in the Netherlands it's not against the law to have sex with people even as young as 12 or 13 as long as if you're 14. Right. Or like if you're like, well what does the law to meditate if you're 15 and your girlfriend's 14 does that legal? And I think it's the state by state thing isn't it? But that's a good question. Is that what you would never be prosecuted but the head, there have been these, we had cases where teenagers have been prosecuted for high, for having um, like Dick pics, all walls. Not only their, their boyfriends or girlfriends from, I'm a big piece of they girlfriends unless they're trans but of themselves. And they've been prosecuted for child porn because they're a child and they, they holding pornography the whole bit about it. Yeah. That whole bit about this colony. Ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          02:26:20       Yeah. They arrested her. She was a sending boys' pictures of her pussy and they arrested her for child pornography. She was 15 years old. Yeah. I mean that's a weird use of the law. You know, like if she's sending it to other girls and boys that are her age, it's not your business. Who are you protecting her in jail? No one. But it's a, it's a, an ability what? When you give someone a game called arrest people that are doing bad, this is, here's the law. If they don't, they don't follow by the byline's. You're allowed to lock them in a cage and this is your job. You're allowed to do that end. I want you to rest a certain amount of people per month, otherwise you're fucked. Yeah. I mean that's the issue with quotas and, and, and police.

Speaker 3:          02:27:03       Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's almost like I come in, but who I heard saying this the other day, that police used to go out and catch bad guys and like solve crimes, but now we've sort of outsourced it to police the job of just making everything kind of Nice.

Speaker 4:          02:27:18       Well, police are glorified revenue collectors and a lot of ways, I mean, why, why are they giving people tickets for certain traffic violations? Yeah. I mean the smoking a plant. Yeah. There's a lot of things that people get arrested for where this, they're essentially just providing money to the system. You know, they're not, they're not serving, you're protecting.

Speaker 3:          02:27:38       It's funny. It's one of the things where when I talk to Americans about the best things about America, the number one thing that Americans will always say is freedom. That this country represents freedom. But the actual daily experience. Like I've lived in New York and I've lived in Copenhagen and I lived in, uh, in Australia and like the daily experience of like, I was standing outside my apartment in New York drinking an open beverage, uh, just watching the world go by and a couple of cops came over and one of them was like, Yo Watson, the glass, what's in the glass? And I was like, just soda. It was fuck soda, just soda. And his, his partner had to be like, oh, don't worry about it. Like, come on, don't make a big deal out of it. And they walked away. But I was like, go to a park in everyone's drinking

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       beer. It's, no, they're not getting harassed by cops. Isn't that a kind of freedom as well? We're taking off their shirts and their playing volleyball, topless breasts hanging out. You're talking about one specific area because if you go to New Orleans, people walked down the street drinking all the time. Yes. And it's more free. Yeah. If you're in Vegas, people walked on the stage second. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, is it better to live in Vegas or New Orleans? You know, some people would say yes and other people would say, I don't want that for the children. It's bad for the children that are abort. That's wrong.

Speaker 5:          02:28:52       I don't know, man. I, I mean it's complex. The, all these issues are very complex. It's like when, when should you just let people run free and ramp into the point where chaos and suse and here's another problem then that was talking about this with a friend of mine the other day about North Korea. Um, when people have become sort of indoctrinated into a specific style of life and behavior and then all of a sudden you remove the rains. Like when people who live in Kansas go to Vegas and bay as opposed to someone who grows up in that environment. Or like say we were, we were looking at the North Korea footage yesterday of them goose stepping down the street and the giant throngs of people who are following the orders and doing the bidding of Kim Jong. And we're saying like what would happen to those people if you're a move this military dictatorship gave them a democratic life, would they even be able to appreciate it and understand it or are they so institutionalized or they so indoctrinated into this very specific style of living in behavior that they wouldn't be able to adjust?

Speaker 5:          02:29:55       Like I talked to Ron miscavige about that, you know, who is he got out of scientology when he was fucking 76 I mean stop and think about that. The guy got in in 1970 and got out in 2012 live the bulk of his life in this really bizarre environment and now all of a sudden he's a free man. I think that's right. And this is one of my concerns about, about laws that prevent people from doing things. This is why I'm sort of libertarian ish when it comes to non economic cultural issues because I actually think you need to inculcate in people and experience of showing restraint on the bus by themselves. Because if the law is does it for you, you, you, you then remove the laws and all of a sudden everyone goes crazy. It's a bit, you know, you can imagine that if all of a sudden street drinking were permitted in New York that people will be vomiting all over the place and like getting, getting drunk because they've been so used to so acclimated to never being allowed to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:30:49       That now it's the forbidden fruit. Go and just get smashed in the past because that's what we can, we can do now. Well, do you know about Amish Amish? Yeah. Rubber spring. Yeah. When they get to do that, what was the hell's playground? Is that the documentary in the Senate? There's a great documentary about it. And these, these people, they have this period of time where they're allowed to do whatever the fuck they want. It's basically when they come maintains, right, they, they, they let loose from the amish communities and they were allowed to indulge jay go hog wild hog where they go, they party fucking hard and then they have to

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       figure out whether or not they want to go back to being amish.

Speaker 3:          02:31:22       Hmm. And most of them do. Yeah. Strange. It's interesting that you used the word institutions joe to describing like North Korea because I think this is another thing that I'm so grateful about America for and why I'm sort of optimistic that trump is not going to destroy this, this country that institutions like this sounds like such a valley girl thing to say. I was going to say institutions like really matter but, but it's, but it's true. You look at places like Hungary and what we've just seen happen in Turkey and in Russia, in Venezuela. And it's much easier for people there who are corrupt or who would like to, to, um, to bring people under their spell to do so because there aren't these big robust divided institutions like the press being fiercely independent, the judicial system being fiercely independent, uh, Congress and the executive hopefully hating each other just enough to keep each other in check, keep themselves in check.

Speaker 3:          02:32:29       And also just the, the, the traditions of American life where there's, there's I think more acceptance of descent and of weirdness than there are in those other places. Like Russians are just very, I don't want to generalize here, but allow me to conformist people, like they've lived under csas and fucking empires for centuries and millennia. Like they like following strong men. Americans aren't like that. And some of them are, there is this kind of militaristic jingoistic side to America, which is very kind of like salute the flag and like say yes please. Like you got to honor the honor, the veterans and everything. But yeah, but yeah, exactly. Respect the office or like kind of stuff. And I think that way tyranny lies. I think the best, the best thing as a mayor that America has ever kind of given the world is its flamboyant, boisterous sense of possibility and craziness that expresses itself in Silicon Valley. And maybe Peter Teal who I might not like, but at least he's unusual in Hollywood. You know, even in Wall Street there are a whole bunch of, there's just an excitement in this place, which, which seeps out in so many different ways in America that I think to try to corral it as a dictator would be like herding cats. Like it'll just never, you know, it'll never, it'll never quite right.

Speaker 4:          02:33:39       Well we can only hope because if trump has his way, he would definitely try to do that. He would try to get all these people to do his bidding and figure out some way to dismantle all of these different institutions and make it much easier for him to make America great again and just fucking force that agenda through. Yeah. I don't, didn't think he would think that he's doing the wrong thing. Woody. I don't know. Do you think, I mean he said he admires Putin. I mean, which is very bizarre. I mean, it's very bizarre. And when he compared what Putin does to what we do, that we do terrible things to like, whoa, that's crazy. That guy murders people on the street. I mean he, any political opposition, he fucking kills them. He kills reporters mean or somebody does, I don't know if it's him or somebody does

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       right outside the Kremlin. A W know on the main bridge leading to the Kremlin at night and all of the security cameras from the Kremlin happened to go off and have their footage missing just when the murder, it's insane. The amount of power that he wields. His stunning. Yeah. If someone on the left in America said, Oh, who's who? Who are we to say that Putin is a bad guy? I think of all the bad things that America's done just right. That's a kind of Noam Chomsky thing to say, America's America's chickens are coming home to roost. We did this in Vietnam and now so you know when I better than Putin, fuck that. I mean, it's the right that's supposed to believe in American exceptionalism. Just not trump. Isn't that well, he's got a very bizarre interests in Russia and that's one of the reasons I think why he was want to release his taxes.

Speaker 1:          02:35:11       The real, the real question is how much money does he have invested in Russia? Like how much, how much financial influence do they have on him? I wonder if part of it is when he says that he admired someone like Putin, if it's just his sort of constitutional sense that he kind of likes a strong man, like his isn't his whole life sort of about I am powerful, I am rich, you know you're going to kneel before me and people who can pull that off. I think just resonate with him in some way that's more so I've always found like the how much money does they have invested in Russia question somewhat less interesting to me. Then why does he want to suck Putin's Dixon Ma, you know like is it the whole mean interpretation, a convenient interpretation of what Putin represents because he doesn't really have time to look at all these different things.

Speaker 1:          02:36:03       You know, it was revealed the other day that he's not really aware that Kim Jong loons. Dot. Kim Jong Il. Did you see that? It is confusing. There are too many Kim's in the careers, but you did not say that there's like this ridiculous thing where he was talking about this gentleman, he was talking about Kim Jong and he was referring to conversations that Kim Jong Il has had with Bush and I mean the whole thing. I think there's too many things to focus on and he's so fucking busy with himself and his business interests and the things that he's trying to push through and we're going to Exxon mobile and all these different subsidiaries that he's kind of invested in. He's got his fucking fingers in so many different pies and he's also just not interested in the affairs of state. He doesn't care about foreign policy and stuff like it's, it's a little bit, he doesn't like learning and stuff. He doesn't like it. He's not a good reader or what's one of the big concerns is that he's not concerned with foreign policy to the point where he's putting off all these things and letting the military do their job in quotes. Did you see the point that he didn't even authorize the mother of all bombs when it was dropped on Afghanistan last week? The military, the option to do what they think is right. And that's what Eisenhower warned about when he left on. That's right. But in some crazy way, don't you feel more safe

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       with the military doing it then with trump doing it in some way? Yes, absolutely. Well, I think there's a real argument that the military has been, that they've been held back to the Paul. They have, I mean, look, you're engaging in war, right? And that there's a real argument that the people in the military make that people die because they're forced to take too many steps before they get clearance to do something when they're being attacked. And so their argument is it's better to let people who really understand war engage in more, but then there's the eisenhower argument that, well, you're dealing with an institution like the military industrial complex. You're dealing with a l I can think of it as an organism that survives on war it, there's a tremendous amount of money that gets pumped into this, this thing that this war machine.

Speaker 5:          02:38:08       Yep. Right. And then what does it want to do? It wants to fucking use all the statistics that a war. That's right. Have you noticed how the the military contractors, if you looked at how, how delicately spread out around America that like they have plants in almost every single state so that there's always a congressperson or a senator who are the military contractors can call up and be like, well you, you're going to lose like 70,000 jobs in this little, of course shit. Potel it'd actually be more, it would make more economic sense for them to have consolidated their operations and be making all the submarines and warships in the same place, but they don't. They make one widget in Delaware, then make another one over here. Another one over here. It's very select got congressman. Yeah. No one's ever going to want that plant to close.

Speaker 5:          02:38:48       It's like mudgee things that we've talked about today. There's super complicated and there's so many different things to consider and it's no real one black and white answer when when you're dealing with so many factions in so many variables and so many things. That's one of the reasons why being a president is a preposterous idea. Is it? It's stupid. It's stupid, isn't it? If I have too much power, I mean you talk about black and white and you like shades of gray. How do you negotiate with the North Koreans and the South Koreans and the Chinese and the Japanese and the Russians about what to do about Syria? We'll show a Syria. Yeah. Shit. I mean in some ways. What did you think of the tree of trump hitting Syria? Well, no one died, right? What he did was attack airfields and blew up airfields. It was a show of force, you know, is it the right thing to do?

Speaker 5:          02:39:41       Shit. I don't, I don't know. Um, I don't understand exactly what is accomplished other than you blow up an airfield and have to rebuild it. I mean, you show people that you can do that, but we already knew you could do that. You show people you're willing to act. I mean, back in 2012 and 2013 I thought that Obama flubbed it by saying that we wouldn't tolerate the use of chemical weapons and then doing nothing when reaction by the right and the left people were very weird war back. Absolutely. I think they've relaxed a little over that. Yeah. When will willing to to go in and get a break. Yeah, exactly. Hold on, I'm going back in. It's like, you know, when you go in the pool, you swim for a while, then I come back out again. I want to get cool again without, with a nice foreign war. Yeah. There was Vietnam and we didn't like that and then we can forget it,

Speaker 3:          02:40:29       bad it long enough. So we did it rock and we didn't like that. But now that's kind of fading, receding into the, into the distant past as well. But I, yeah, I, I actually interviewed Phil Donahue on huffpost live because he was a very outspoken antiwar critic. And I was saying at the time, like, can't we be nuanced enough to make a difference, but to understand the difference between the Iraq war, a full scale invasion based on a misunderstanding or a misleading interpretation of what Iraq's capabilities. And it's mean, it's, um, weapons program was, and this Syrian problem, which is a horrifying civil war where a dictator is gassing his own people and we didn't want to invade, but drawing some kind of a line in the sand and saying, you can't do that in the 21st century. You can't just be dropping gas canisters on kids.

Speaker 3:          02:41:21       So they bleed out their eyes and like cough up their own lungs. That's not a way to behave in the United States as an exceptional nation. And we'll do something about that. You're right. That about it really had his hands tied because he went to Congress and Congress didn't give him the power to do it, but I kind of felt somehow sort of slightly vindicated when trump did it. Like I was not one of the people on the left who was like, oh my goodness, what's he doing? I was like, well, okay. I mean at least that's a, at least it's something

Speaker 5:          02:41:48       I agree. But it's also an incredibly complicated situation because Assad is against Isis.

Speaker 6:          02:41:55       Okay?

Speaker 3:          02:41:56       Superficially, yes, but

Speaker 3:          02:42:02       he uses isis as an excuse to be able to target all of his political opponents. It's too much. It's too twice. It's two twice dead end. There's no way to get rid of isis without getting rid of Assad because the locals in Syria who will lift height Assad, who would, who are anti Assad, they hate aside even more than they hate isis. So as long as Assad is there, they're going to give isis their sympathies. So this idea of like, I mean, basically the whole isis thing I think is just a smokescreen to allow Putin and Assad to crackdown on dissidents.

Speaker 5:          02:42:39       But isn't it also like a lot of the same issues that they faced when they dethroned Khadafi in Libya you create this to happen. Exactly. I think it's too late. Failed State. Yeah. I think we've missed the, we missed the boat in Syria or what the fuck, what do we do? President Josh Zaps? What do we do? We build a time machine, Joe and uh, we go back to 2012 there's not much you can do that. And I did. They probably wasn't even much we could do. Do you think you can imagine, oh wait, you should have like one president that deals with just Syria. Like that should be your 100% that's right. The idea of having a president that also deals with Exxon Mobil and BP and then also was talking to the coal people and also is talking to the people in Silicon Valley. You know why you haven't administration, right.

Speaker 5:          02:43:24       I mean, so the, the secretary of State is broadly overseeing it and then they will have a special envoy to the Middle East who should be split, who is basically as the president of the president of the United States for Syria. Yeah. And then Sean Spicer's in, in charge of cleaning up lies. I mean that's what he's using alternative facts. President. Do you think that that the world would be better or worse off if America had just stayed completely out of the Middle East from like the end of the Cold War on, I don't know. And I don't know how you fix the problem of military dictatorships. How do you, how do you stop that? How do you overthrow them? I mean the CIA has been battling that for years. I mean, they will propping them up or propping them up or propping them up and shooting them down or you know, trying to keep that issue over there and keeping them from becoming big enough where they spread to the point where they become another Nazi Germany or what have you.

Speaker 5:          02:44:17       It's a really good question and I'm too fucking stupid to give you an answer. I mean, who knows. I mean look, it's just disturbing that something like North Korea can exist in 2017. I want to go, I really want to go to North Korea. I think it'd be fascinating. Really. Yeah. Cause it's like the last kind of hermit kingdom lift. It's the last true Soviet era. Communist dictatorship. You can probably control. Yeah. I think you can. I mean, but the problem is you have to be kind of um, you know, accompanied by a Chaperon who works for the government who only shows you the things that the government wants you to say. Henry Rollins went, that's right. He to died show. Yeah. That's so gangster. He's so good. I was in New Zealand actually listening to your epis to that episode at the, at the lounge in Oakland airport, coming back to Australia a couple of months ago.

Speaker 5:          02:45:09       And Henry was really inspiring to me in that episode because it made me realize like, yeah, just because I'm getting old and like I'm going to be a dad and everything doesn't mean you have to lose your sense of adventure. That dude is bad ass. He's got a hundred percent sense of adventure to the point where he won't have a relationship. He's like, it's not, it's not worth it. It's just too much work. But he's also an interesting case study in giving kids medication, a very early age. He was one of the very early Prozac kids. Oh really? Yeah. They are Ritalin rather. Yeah, they hooked him up. They hooked him up with Ritalin when he was fucking five years old, man, from five years old to high school. How does he feel about that now? Terrible. I mean he just described it like it's horrible, like he's white knuckled his way through the day and the end of the day the Ritalin would wear off and he'd be exhausted and we'd go through class.

Speaker 5:          02:45:55       I mean that's a good chunk of his intense personality and behavior has to do with him being raised on speed. Yeah, just crazy. It's funny how it has a different impact on people who have add and then people who don't. Right. It doesn't us. Yeah. Well what is add, you know what I mean? It's a real thing, but how does it manifest itself in a person and how does it manifest in a person that is formed in this environment where they're forced to be in is a rigid, controlled social experiment called school. That's right. And why do we have classroom? Why don't we, it has to be 30 people and they all have to be sitting in a row. And then he said, program you to have a regular job that you don't have. Yeah, I don't have, he doesn't have, there's a lot of people that don't have jobs where you have to work in a fucking cubicle.

Speaker 5:          02:46:41       Well that's one thing that I assumed we would have. We would have gotten to today, which I'm surprised we didn't, which is like the rise of automation and robotics and stuff. I mean, millions. How many millions of Americans, I think it's the largest, the largest employment sector full working class males is driving self driving cars. It just around the bloody corner. What's going to happen to the millions of Americans who make a living driving trucks? The big solution to that that a lot of people bring up is universal basic income, but universal basic income, uh, you know there's, there's people that have a problem with that because they believe that people are only motivated by want and then as soon as you give them money, then they're not going to just pursue their interest. They're going to lay around and do nothing and just live off of that money only.

Speaker 5:          02:47:22       Well, the, and this also the question of whether or not that's right or wrong and comes back to America's sort of puritan work work ethic as well, right? The idea that it would necessarily be wrong for a person not to be doing something productive, but like if the robots are doing all the work and they're producing lots of wealth, then who cares if someone's doing something productive or not. Right? We're worried that they're going to get mad at the people like you that are out there being ambitious and they're gonna kill me. Mercedes. Well maybe I would sometimes not do anything as well. I'm Australian. What criminals? We have a saying that, thank God we were convicted by Woo, thank God we were settled by convicts instead of by Puritans to well it's a good point. I mean we've, we've fighting off the echoes of those fucking ridiculous instincts from the puritans Atlanta to here.

Speaker 5:          02:48:04       We're still fighting that off. I mean that's a big part of what America is. Yeah. I think that would be a big impediment to universal basic income. The set, this puritan sense of justice that there is justice and also I think maybe people just want work. They want purpose. Like the people who were retrenched have purpose as well as universal basic income. You would have to sort of program it into the Zeitgeists of the culture, right? And give people what voluntary ways of expressing themselves and contributing that weren't tied to their income. Encourage people to pursue actual interests. Like say if you gave people universal basic income and encourage them to pursue artistic venues or ventures, you know, whether it's a writing or painting or whenever the fuck it is. And you say, look, there's a lot of merit in that. Like you and you can do this.

Speaker 5:          02:48:55       Your food is bought you, you have, you have a home, you can eat and you can sleep. You have a roof over your head now. Do what you want. What do you want to do? I think it'd be a fence. It's a fantastic experiment and I'm glad that there are a few little jurisdictions in Scandinavia and Canada, which seem to be trying it out because I'd be interested to know how many, like there are, you could, you could imagine different groupings of human psychology. Like some people will be like, awesome, I don't have to worry about making money. I'm going to become the greatest artisinal, you know, furniture maker that I can, and that's fantastic. And then at the other end of the spectrum, there'll be people who are like, sweet, don't have to work. Like I'm just going to sit at home. That's fine too day.

Speaker 5:          02:49:33       What else be that crime rates lower because of that. Oh, I'm sure that's what we should be hoping for it and the idea, the real good argument for universal basic income is that the money that you spend giving people certain universal basic income you would save money from people going to jail, juvenile detention, medical issues, all sorts of issues that come out of poverty. There's a lot of issues that come out of poverty that are directly connected to that. Yeah. This is one of the arguments for welfare as well. I mean people who say that it wouldn't have any impact on crime. I would just say look at the different countries in the world that have more or less generous welfare systems and the ones with more generous welfare systems do tend to be more peaceful places. There might be other reasons as well. I think they're correlated and I think also one of the things that I try to do, I really try to support people who make things and make things by hand.

Speaker 5:          02:50:28       People companies that like make stuff. I like when people make stuff. I like when when people pursue like, like this, this tables, I mean by an artist, you know, I like when people make handmade knives. I'd like that stuff. I think the more API, I think people get deep satisfaction in doing things like that. You know, like I'm Russell Bill, the guy made that clock right there. That's a handmaid clock. That dude built that fucking thing. That one. This tgg studios. It built that right there. That's a handmade clock too. I tried to support that shit as much as possible. I think that that is the future. The there's, there's, when I look at that clock, I know a guy made that. Yeah, that means something to me. Yeah. It's cool. It's cool. It is also a really cool looking at, if you asked me to make a clock, wouldn't know where to start.

Speaker 5:          02:51:16       Well, you would figure it out. I would if you gave them the books and all that stuff, but you might, it might not be a clock for you and Maggie. Yeah, that, that Buddhist sculpture. Somebody made that and send it to me. It's great. I mean there's a lot of things that people can make that other people would enjoy. And I think our teasel goods and services and things that people do that are hand crafted, they have a special meaning to them that people they value. I wonder if there's something that's mass produced. I wonder if enough people can find self expression through that to counteract the uh, the job losses that are resulting from and will continue to result from technological advance. Well, I think that with universal basic income is possible, but I think making things is not necessarily the only way to do it. I mean it's, it has making art, being creative, encouraging

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       people to think of that as an actual way to live. Yeah, that's a big, that's a big impediment and a big hurdle to get over it. It's like the North Korea thing that you were saying, like if you got rid of the North Korean regime, would the people who lived under it have the scope, have the just a mental scope to know what to do with themselves? In some ways it's a comparable question with capitalism, right? If you took away the capitalist incentive to work and suddenly all of a sudden everybody was liberated and had a basic income that that gave them all the sustenance that they need. Would they have the horizons available to them? Having been raised in this idea of like, you gotta get gotta work, I gotta climb your way up the ladder. I got to get a nine to five job, go to college, get an education, you know, please the boss, get your promotion to have all of that suddenly fall away and be like, you know what?

Speaker 1:          02:52:50       Just go and make clocks. But Cy, you anyway, boob would figure it out, but other people would be like, lottery winners. They just go crazy. Yeah. Like lottery winners almost universally lose all their money. I know. And they end up on the happier they, yeah. If you just, if you win $5 million in the lottery, everybody goes, Josh, come on. It's free for you. I can't hillsborough. Yeah, exactly. Yup, that's right. And then people start, look, you and I are going to do a business. We're going to paint cars. You're like, fuck, I don't want pink cars. And next thing you know your loan and money out and family wants money from you and you're just dealing with a lot of bullshit. And also you have expectations immediately after winning that things are going to get a lot better. As you know from anyone who has paid attention to there the process of their own consciousness, whether that's through psychedelics or flotation tanks or you know what Sam Harris and Dan Harris, we're talking about recently about meditation.

Speaker 1:          02:53:39       Your, your conscious perception of life is not determined by what's going on outside. It is trivially occasionally and like into like for in the short term, but in the long term, your actual happiness, it comes from within. But people always take the path of least resistance. And oftentimes the path of least resistance is these patterns that we've carved into our behavior, these behavior patterns that we've carved into our psyche. And a lot of times those aren't even the path of least resistance. They become the path of more resistance, but we're so accustomed to those paths that we think of them and treat them as if they're the right path. Hmm. Mind blown. Fucking man. There's no answers. There's no answers to a portion. There's no answers in North Korea. We didn't figure out shit. It's not the point. Joe Pine to figure it out. Let's end this and do yours. Yeah. Wonderful. I'll talk to you. I'm going to do like a quick, quick round of questions and also chickasha terrestrials on my podcast with Joe. Josh motherfucking steps. Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, sir. I love you. I love you too, brother. All right. We'll be right back with Josh as apps.
