Speaker 1:          00:00:40       with such a long absence of two weeks off the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, you were Jones and I was Jones and we had to bring you back the three most pertinent guests in the same week. Joe Diaz, Ari Shaffir and they'll finally, Duncan Trussell my favorite buddy. Hi, I'm, I'm, I'm psyched to have you on for a whole bunch of reasons because there's a bunch of nutty shit that's been going down that we must discuss. All right. Did you hear about the Cork Glue on a particle that the large Hadron collider has created? No. Oh, this is fantastic stuff. We talked about it yesterday or Monday or yesterday. Okay. Yesterday, one sugar tube of this shit weighs 40 billion pounds. Wow. It's more dense than a neutron star. It's like the singer, single densest piece of matter that that theoretically is, is physically possible and they created it. What w

Speaker 2:          00:01:35       they created it and what happened exactly as it go through the ground and the fucking, who knows? You have a marble, you drop the marble and the ground. It shoots right through China, comes out an exit wound like Kennedy's head and then it goes back down and goes, it's like a nonstop thing. You like gravity, you know what you mean? Comes up and down through the earth. The earth, I think I own, hi. What the fuck does, I think I heard something. Not about this, but the possibility of this and how that could be one of the possible extinction events is that it sets off a chain reaction and sucks everything in. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       Oh my God. Well, if you think about the idea of that this, this cork glue on thing, the idea that they can create this, you know, this is the bottom line about all this shit is it's never going to stop right there. No way they're going to keep going and if they can create something that's this heavy, what if they created enough of it? We're really is like something that goes through the fucking earth. If you had something that was so heavy that it would like, you would drop it and it would just shoot down through the earth. Yeah. Where would it stop? It wouldn't, would it? I don't know. I mean if it's so heavy that it smashes rock and then when it hits the core, what happens? Does the core melted?

Speaker 2:          00:02:45       Is it it? Maybe it gets melted in the core. It makes a volcano. Yeah. What does it make a new volcano? I mean, does it matter how big this cork gluon plasma? We're talking probably a tiny, tiny thing. Yeah. It's nothing like a micro meteorite

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       or something. Yeah, it's, it's the, the crazy thing is these guys that are doing this stuff, they all know that this is crazy and they're joking around about it. So there's some photos now of them playing half life. If you just look up large Hadron collider is guys get theater theatrical with halflife street theater. There's them, he's got, uh, the orange safety helmet on just like the half life of character with a crow bar. And the other guys got like a head crab on. Have you seen it? You seen it? I just opened it. It's hilarious. They know what the fuck they're doing. I mean, I guess they just, you just have to keep doing it, but they're aware of it and all the while there's this wall, this all comes out. This is a cosmologists have reconciled this a seemingly impossible contradiction. The contradiction of the super position.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Contradiction, you know, the super position is that something can exist and not exist at the same time. And there's two different, there's, there's the multiverse theory and there's the many worlds theory. And apparently they figured out some way to reconcile these two theories. It's so hard to fucking understand. It's like, it's so difficult to wrap my brain around, you know, I'm, I'm just not really smart enough or have enough experience with this kind of shit. But, you know, the observability of the universe, it's like, it's when you get down to a quantum particles, when you get down to, you know, subatomic particles, it gets really weird. It's a hard to understand how this can be real, that something can appear and disappear and no one knows where it went. And they can also appear in both, in two different positions at the same time. And it's the same particle.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       Isn't there also something where apparently your expectation of the thing somehow impacts it? The viewer, they don't understand that either. You know, there's, it's really hard for me to explain it without butchering it, but you can look up Dr Quantum, you know, there's some, some videos of it online where it's explained in cartoons for complete retards like you and I, and it's basically they, you know, they shoot these particles and there's a different reaction when people are watching then when people aren't watching, you know, and uh, the idea that something is in a superposition basically means it could be in motion and it can be still at the same time. It's like the way they describe it as the, it's like you cannot see a dead cat and a live cat that have the same cat at the same time. You know? And the idea that a lot of people believe is that every single possibility happens for every single it. Like say you open up a door, every fucking possible thing happens once you open up that door. Infinite possibilities, but not to you, to you. One thing happens and you live in this one dimension. And in this one dimension, this one thing happens. And for everyone else, you know, or all these other use that exist in an infinite number of different universes. You don't experience that,

Speaker 3:          00:06:05       but it happens. That's why goals are so important because when you have a goal, you're setting something in the future, which is, if you think about things in the way you just described it, what you're really thinking about is in this great array of possibilities in the future, there's one node that contains within it all the different possibilities that involve whatever your goal happens to be. And so the goal becomes literally a kind of compass that's guiding you toward this place and temporal spatiality where these things that you want to have happen happen. That's what everybody says. If you want to be successful, have a goal, and you know when I want, before I knew about this, I used to think that meant yes, because it will give me the discipline in the motivation to work towards what I want. But metaphysically you may actually be sort of guiding the ship of your life towards this temporal possibility and then getting the things that you want. It's a lot of

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       right. But there's also the problem of the cynic in the cynic point of view, which, you know, Penn and teller or big cynics on that bullshit show. And I really liked Penn Jillette. He's a very fun guy. And uh, one of the things that he really nailed is all these assholes that pitch the secret and you try and tell people with horrible terminal diseases that it's their fault. But that shit is ridiculous because it is not absolute. It does not work in all circumstances. And little babies are not responsible for getting hit by bullets and drive bys. Cause that shit does happen. So it is not, it's not clean, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       Oh No, it's not clean. But if you want to get really weird, if you, if we're talking about this idea that you're, your perception and faith guide you into the different, all the different universes that exist, then Penn and teller, there's such skeptical assholes that maybe they've guided themselves into a universe of absolute boring bullshit. Those guys just want to live in a world of like, you know, what's it called? Newtonian physics where everything comes from an accident and all that stuff. It's the religion that's the religion of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       So you're, what you're saying is that because they've refused to believe in any psychic phenomenon, they refuse to believe in anything trippy or woo woo that they're, they live in a limited world.

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       Penn and teller should know my mom got bone cancer. My mom went to a faith healer. My, my mom, uh, her bone cancer is now like almost gone. You tell me. We did the faith healer do it. Was it her faith that did it? It's fucking bone cancer. Masta ties breast cancer into our bones, her tumor markers. That's how they measure bone cancer or less than when she went in and got the original diagnosis. So it's reversing, it's going backwards now. He went to a faith healer. I'm not a liar. I don't, you know what I mean? I'm not, I, I'm not making this shit up, dude. Do I think it could be other things? Sure. Probably a combination of everything. But that was on medication as well. Yeah, she was. She was, she was, and she also cut sugar out and there's a lot of different things that she did, but one component of it was this event that she went to.

Speaker 3:          00:09:07       Now do I believe in faith healers? Nah, no, I don't. But I do believe that if somebody can create the illusion in the mind of a person, some kind of event, to give them the faith to believe that they can heal themselves, then maybe that works. The mind controls that. I mean, think about it. Your body is, when cancer happens in your DNA starts fucking up. That's part of your body. That's you, yourselves. Are you, your neurons are you? It's all you to think that you can't control that. The thing that some deeper part of you can't control that. It's crazy. Of course you could. Is it that or is it that this faith healer puts her on this incredibly positive vibration and because of the fact that he thinks that this woman or this was it a woman or she thinks she was a woman or as a man, my mom was your mom a metal?

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       Are you saying? I never checked. You don't know if the faith healer or as a man or a woman of faith, you are as a man. His name's John of God. Well, maybe your mom, because of the fact that she so believes and so needs this to happen. She goes and maybe all the sudden she has this incredible feeling of positive expectations and instead of doom and gloom and that's enough to turn things around. That's it. That's what I did. Then she's also on medication too, dude, you gotta you have to, the idea is it's like you're not medication. You know? I don't know. Bone Marrow River where you're, you're, you're in a way your phone away. That's not what you want. You want bone come back. You're, you're, you're not just your mind. You're not just your body. So it's like, I think you'd have to address the problem with, well you are just your mind and your body, but it's all one unit.

Speaker 3:          00:10:54       You are, you want to address each piece, each piece of the puzzle, like give your mind something to work on. Your mind is dealing with the horror of riding around in a car that's breaking down and it will soon turn into warm food. That sucks when you have a western doctor being like, well, you know, statistically, which the doctor did say to my mom, uh, she had six months to live and that was like over a year ago. Uh, the, the doctor, when your, when your mind hears that, it's not like, ah, you know what? I'm going to really start healing now. You're just like, fuck, I'm dead meat. I'm about to go on to infinity. And so then they're like, we understand that you're feeling depression, so we're going to prescribe some antidepressants to you to help you deal with the sorrow of your own demise.

Speaker 3:          00:11:42       Now you're fucking with your brain in the wrong way. You're messing it up with antidepressant. They do when people are diagnosed with terminal cancer that give them antidepressants, Pallium, Xanax, calm down the anxiety or just going to relax you and do infinity. Whoa. That sounds like a good move though. If you're fucked up on ease your mind bone cancer. Yeah, no. If it's a wrap, it's a wrap. Right. And when it's going to be a wrath eventually for all, what would it be better to go out? No, that's the problem man. Especially with the problem with cancer is that, um, we've heard so much stuff about it that you hear, you know, the cancer diagnosis for a lot of people, you're like, I'm dead. Right. But, um, one of the other things that my mom did, and there's some great books out there that are, uh, basically say that, uh, cancer loves sugar. So if you're fucking drinking a lot of sugar sugary stuff, then the tumors will grow faster. So somehow cancer doesn't do that well. And then an acidic environment. So if you start drinking alkaline, alkaline, alkaline. Yeah. So it's something like drinking lemon juice and all this stuff. Healthy

Speaker 1:          00:12:46       for a lot of Greens, a lot of, uh, yeah. Well that's really what's best for the body. You have to know where our bodies, I mean, the Paleo Diet is one that's really popular right now. And the idea is that, you know, during the caveman days, what do they eat? They eat vegetables that were edible and they eat meat. Yeah. You know, and that's really what you're supposed to be eating. You're not supposed to be eating any pastas or grains or anything funky, right. Anything that people created and you know, no soups. Gluten. Yeah. You're supposed to eat pasta and I mean, you're supposed to eat meat and grain or meat and vegetables. Yeah. No Pasta, no grains, nothing human created. And just think of yourself as like, you know, a person living in that era. You know, really that's the healthiest way to live, man. You know, the healthiest way to live is to get a lot of vegetables, a lot of like Broccoli and anything with like, you know, with fiber that's going to clean out your colon vitamins. You know, Brock Lesnar had to go in for a colon surgery. He had diver diverticulitis that you get from eating too much meat. It's a disease that you get from literally not having vegetables and it's a terrible one where your guts rot out. It's really scary shit.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       Can I tell you guys something that's really embarrassing that has to do with uh, in tennis. [inaudible] um, this sounds so stupid and someone sent me this video as a joke, which is this guy showing how to shit what? Yeah, the Western, I was using one of those platforms that you put over the toilet feed up on this platform. Yeah. Cause that's the healthy way to squat. Did this technique, and I have to tell you, I am shitting like a 10 year old. It's the craziest fucking thing ever. Possibly even mean you shouldn't, we haven't brought you shooting before. Where you having promised shitting before w no, not having problems shitting, but it's like, you know like people, Americans will sit on the toilet and read. Right, right. I'm going to read a book. It's like shitting is not supposed to take that lock. Yeah. Look at your dog. How long does it take your dog to shit. If your dog takes longer than like a minute to shit, your automatic like, oh something's wrong. Something's wrong with the dog food. That's exactly right. And that's why you're a scientist.

Speaker 4:          00:14:53       No Man. I, the problem is, is like joy it though it's more of a, I enjoy the whole process. I could squirt it out real quick if I want it to, but I enjoy it feels good. Joy having turds. Yes. You don't enjoy taking a nice shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:07       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       Do you? I love it. I love it to him. I'm going to say his favorite activities, especially when I eat a lot of lettuce and it just comes on nice and loose shows. Ah, yeah. But it's not something I look forward to. I like the little plop splash that plops back and I'm like, gives you a little kiss on your butt hole from little piece of water. You don't look forward to it. Like when you're coming home, you're entered into the door and you're like, I am going to take a giant shit right now. You don't look forward to that.

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       Well now of course. I mean I wouldn't, looking forward to it. It's like a weird, like I, I look forward to it. The walking dead, the second season coming out. That's, I look forward to you don't look forward to a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:15:42       It's not, I mean, yeah. Okay, fine. I look forward to it, but it's not, it doesn't take up my time. I'm not like, I'm not listening to love songs on my radio therapist about potty over there. I know how many times a day do your shit.

Speaker 3:          00:15:54       I shit once a day.

Speaker 1:          00:15:55       All right. Wow. That's it. So you're not enjoying Coby this crazy fucking African African you to change your diet. You're supposed to shit twice a day should all three times a day probably. If you eat a lot more, you're supposed to, first of all, you're supposed to eat several meals a day and that's supposed to be just one or two meals a day, right? If you want to be lean and healthy and have a lot of energy, the key is to not having your body in a constant state of digestion, right? So your body is wanting to adjusting minimal amounts, not some big fucking giant gorging meal that just rent your whole system. Well, if you do that, what's that stuff going to do? It's going to sit inside you and wait for the one big evacuation event at the end of the night. No, it's going to shit throughout the day. It's going to be done, was going to push it out.

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       So, um, have you, because of your mom's situation, have you changed your diet? Any of you started getting like conscious about what you eat?

Speaker 3:          00:16:46       Uh, you know, not because of my mom's situation weirdly, but, um, I, I did start taking vitamins a and, and I've started taking this stuff called fanning and Relora, which lowers the, uh, there's a chemical in your body associated with stress. It gets released by your adrenal gland and it has some, apparently lowers the amount of that stuff in your body. What's it called? Uh, one of the pills is called [inaudible] and I guess t, h, e, t, h, e, n, and the other stuff is called rural Laura. And one's like this. It's one of them's like more relaxing than the other. You take it at night and the other one is just a it like, I don't know if you'd call it a no. Tropic new tropic. How do you say it? Nootropic yeah, new tropics. It does say on the thing, you know, helps focus and I have to agree. It really does

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       wait to try this new tropic formula that we've, we've come out with. We're a, we're finalizing it and they'd just finished the formula that this guy, Chris Markus, have you tried any of it? You've been trying it. I'm done with my supply. This, this shit gives you the most fucked up, vivid dreams ever. I'm going to get you some last night. Here's my dream. My, the House that I grew up in, Arnold Schwarzenegger lives in it, but it's not the house I grew up in. It's some weird house that's on the rocks right in front of water that apparently is semi public. So Arnold Schwarzenegger is living there now and he's like swimming around. But all these people are staring at him because of his situation and because of the scandal. But he doesn't give a fuck. Not only is he not give a fuck, but he's in really good shape now in my dream.

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       And he keeps wanting to pull his balls out and now he's, he pull his balls out, but he puts his little bikini underwear on, like, you know, like a Frenchman would, where I was like, and he pulls his ball somehow or another through the back of his underwear and there where his ass cheeks are and they're giant. These giant balls that he has hanging outside of his underwear by his ass hall. Somehow or another, they're that big. And you know, he's an old man, but he looks spectacular and he moves like with confidence and grace and dives into the water. And I'm like, I gotta get my wife away from this motherfucker. I'm looking at this old crazy man, like he's just going to fuck every woman within a, um, a mile radius. And it's like, he has no, no inhibitions, no, no worries about it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       And all these people were watching him and there's a family that's sitting behind this rock and they're like, you know, there's, they're sitting there watching Arnold moving around swimming. He keeps taking his pants off. He keeps taking his bikini bottoms off and like washing. And what shop, whatever it is. It's some crazy, well, I don't know what it mean. Freud would have a fucking field day with this chair. Like what is this dream supposed to represent? Well, terrified of Arnold Swartz. And I would love to have seen your face while dreaming and just like the little flinches and your face with it, whether they were filings or fear.

Speaker 3:          00:19:48       Yeah. Well you have to look at it like this. Uh, they say, uh, one way to analyze dreams as you look at every part of a dream is a projection of some aspect of your life. So Arnold Schwarzenegger, isn't that your id? Isn't that your lower primal self? Some kind of like that. That would be that the, the dry, the sex drive, the like the drive, the power drive. So you're kind of vanity drive. He's a bodybuilder. That's like the most vain thing you could possibly do. And then the public ocean, you could say, well the public ocean, that's your, um, is that your public life is that you're doing the podcast and you kind of like have all your shit in front of everyone on the planet and so you're seeing like a projection of your ed swimming through are reacting to like,

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       I think I'm thinking about all sorts of negritude. Yeah, we talked about yesterday. I don't think it's me. I don't think that represents me. I see where you're going with that. But no, because what this represents to me now, when I found out that he fucked his maid and they shot Lowe's and it was made in that apparently he was doing it for a long time. What he represents to me, it's like this almost like unbridled hedonist that regardless of the stakes of, you know, of whatever fucked up thing that he does sexually. You now he's the governor, he's a giant movie star, multimillionaire married to a Kennedy, basically Shriver's she's some sort of a Kennedy right in into this respectable family, but yet banging maids fucking all sorts of checks all over the planet. I'm sure he just never pulled it back, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       And that's, that to me is amazing. There's something about it in, in my dream, he was just completely without, without remorse. When in my dream he was owning it and my dream, he was, you know, this is me. I'm this crazy freak. I'm out here. I bathe, I UC my balls, you know? I mean, that was who he was. In my dream, we've smiling and laughing and waving to people and he didn't give a fuck, you know, but in real life, I mean the poor guy is falling apart and real life. He's a 60 year old man, kicked out of his house, you know, and his family knows, he, he, you know, he had a child the literally two weeks apart from the, his own child with the maid, the maid that was there made for 20 fucking years. You think will survive all this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       I know you will. No, no, that's a wrap. Yeah. You think like, if you made a termino fought fire right now, Don people are done with him. How could he do this, this, this, this is what I think. I mean, it's possible. Anything can happen. I might be just talking out of my ass. I'm the first one to say I'm amazed at some of the people that have made comebacks. You know, we'll look at Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton's a respectable, you know, former president now, dude, I remember when I was, it was during the 90s. Well, we were working on news radio and the Monica Lewinsky scandal went town. Uh, Bill Clinton, man, dude, they, hey, you need him. If you listened to Republican radio, which I used to listen to all the time, there are people that wanted him dead. They thought that he represented everything foul about the world and the fact that they caught him getting head from some 20 year old girl and then lying about it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       And then they drag him. I mean, they impeached him. You know, people think impeach means kicked out of office. It's not what it means. Would impeach means you, you bring someone in to decide whether or not you're kicking them out of office. And that's what they did with him. Man, they sat him down and he had to say, that is not my recollection of the war. You know, that's not, what is the word? You know? He's talking about the word, you know, sex. The, I didn't, I did not have sexual relations as I took it to mean sexual relations, you know, and they can't even say, what the fuck are you saying, man?

Speaker 3:          00:23:24       It's the worst man. Wait, when whenever I really start feeling like we live in an advanced civilization and what really, I had a hard time and we're really doing it. Then I hear about this sexually repressed bullshit where like, so what? Swartz and Agar, God, his fucking made pregnant Clinton got a blow job. Who Cares? Meanwhile, George Bush is fucking dropping bombs on Iraqi babies and everybody's like, it's fine. He's a great president. He's killing humans.

Speaker 1:          00:23:52       Well, I liked it out. The Obama's doing it in the liberals aren't saying a fucking boy. Isn't that the greatest hypocrisy of all time? Amazing. Somehow because Obama's dropping bombs on Libya, it's okay. All those democratic actors that love to talk during table readings and where Obama pins, you can all go suck my dick or stupid you guys. You're all dumb. You all got sucked into a system and he's done a lot of other great stuff. Yeah, he's, he is the same thing as Bush. He's just showing them. Yeah. You know, Georgia Bill Mar, which is what I thought you were talking when we have a conversation before podcasts. We talked about it yesterday, how Bill Maher had this really brilliant point about how he calls himself a Christian and yet when they were asking him about Osama bin Laden's death, he was like, anybody who questions whether or not that's good should have their mind, their head checked, you know, like, which is nothing like Christianity's nothing like Christian doctrine.

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       There hasn't been a Christian president for a long, I'd like a Christian president. I'd love to see. That would be a real one. It'd be a real one. Would be Ron Paul. Yes. Ron Paul has a legit Christian. He's so legitimate. He doesn't even believe in evolution. You Know Ron Paul, thanks. Scott says, well, he's not stupid, man. Look, he's got some wacky ass fucking ideas, but he, he believes in creationism, you know, and look, life itself is fucking beyond bizarre. All right. I'm, I'm not ruling out the possibility of creationism, but when you start talking about evolution, just being a theory and you don't necessarily agree with that theory, like you're in Wacko Ville. Like evolution is not just a theory, it's provable. There's like there's transitionary fossils, there's, there's thousands of scientists for hundreds of years have been collecting data and they can show natural adaptation. They can show change, they can show things in our lifetime. We could show about humans, especially like men in Tibet that have gone, uh, that live at very high altitudes and their bodies have changed and evolved to be very different from our bodies. Yeah. And they've done this to, to adapt to this really harsh new environment. It's just what happens man, if you read the trial ogs, yes. The Mckenna. Yeah. Rupert Sheldrake. Yeah. When they start talking about the morphogenic field.

Speaker 3:          00:26:00       Yeah. So that like the idea is that like, and, and so the evolution, like their idea of evolution, they, they, they asked this really awesome question, which is like, you have Newtonian physics, the laws of the universe, how the universe works. And some people apparently think that these laws of the universe are eternal laws never changing. They don't evolve. Everything else is evolving, but the laws of the universe stay the same. And so the awesome question they ask is, well, okay, where, where did, where did these laws exist before the big bank? What did they exist in? Some kind of bizarre field that it's like, you know, the Mckenna has some awesome name, 40 puts hyper, he attaches hyper to everything. So I'm kind of like hyperspace she all platonic field, but like, where do they exist? Do they exist there? So they're awesome. Crazy idea is this thing called a super attractor that exist in the future, which is like this perfect form.

Speaker 3:          00:26:51       This like the mckinna freely uses the word God because he's not afraid to use words to like, you know, put handles on things. But, uh, it's this idea of this super perfection that exists in the future. Kind of like the ultimate goal. Like what we're talking about. And it's so powerful. It's trends in dental object at the end of time and it's pulling us towards it. And so evolution is literally is us being drawn into a relationship with this perfect form and shifting to become it, to like transform into it. And that's what the, the force of evolution has now. You know, creationism, it's almost the reverse of creationism or something. It's like the creator instead of existing at the beginning of time, blasting out everything is somehow sitting at the end of time, sucking everything into itself, which is

Speaker 1:          00:27:41       pretty cool. Yeah. Well, there's a law or, or, or rule or an ethic to the universe and that's a, things keep getting more and more complex. Things don't seem to simplify, right? Nothing in our lifetime does at least nothing that we can observe over the course of the life of the earth does from the earth cooling to earth, developing single cell organisms to multicell organisms and flowering plant life after the, you know, the Yucatan crater after the, the, the big explosion that killed the dinosaurs. I mean everything just keeps getting more and more and more and more complex to the invention of course, of electronics. And that's where things have gotten really particularly bizarre because if you look at life and you look at electronics and you know you were objective, you are not a human being, you are not a carbon based life form.

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       You were just something without form that objectifies or disseminates information. Something that looks at all the, the data and comes to a conclusion. Well if you looked at the human life on this planet and then you looked at the life of technology, man, um, I know technology doesn't have cells and I know technology doesn't have fingernails and shit like that, but God dammit, isn't it growing with us? It, isn't it evolving with us and are there dead ones that are just laying around just like old fossils and bodies at apple, two computer that you have sitting in your fucking garage and we turn on, it doesn't really work anymore, but you still keep it. That's like your grandma's body. You know, that's a dead body man. And we have a symbiotic relationship with this stuff now. Whereas, you know, like I've talked about this many times, I leave the fucking house without my phone.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       I'm scared. I am a lost in the world. I am such a little bitch. I can't drive in my car without my phone. And I'm like, what do I have to goals and money? I, I'm terrified that I don't know anybody's phone number anymore. I know like four or five people's phone numbers. Right. You know? So if I went to a payphone when goodluck fucking finding one, are there any payphones anywhere? I would have to go to like a seven 11 and buy one of those rechargeable, you know, those are reusable phones. Yeah. Murder phones. Those, one of those a fair phones. And, and you know, and try to like figure out how to call people. They're fun. Well that's what I was thinking they use them for. Right. I always feel like they use them for crime and for affairs.

Speaker 3:          00:29:53       Yeah. Um, have you seen uh, the transcendent man? Yes. You saw that? Yeah. Which is incredible. Amazing. What is it? It's cursed

Speaker 1:          00:30:03       well, uh, is a, uh, they call them a futurist and he's responsible for many, many patents. He's a brilliant, brilliant man and um, he is a huge proponent of the idea of the technological singularity. And the idea behind that is that one day artificial intelligence is going to literally and virtually come alive and we're going to merge with it somehow. We are either going to be downloaded into computers or consciousness is going to be replicated and indistinguishable from our current consciousness and that will be downloaded into computers and though our biological body will die, are RF electronic signal, that is our consciousness that has been recreated. Like, you know, like you copy a Microsoft word file. Yeah. You will copy your mind. You will copy your consciousness, your soul. Yeah. Yeah. You will copy something and you will put it into this, whatever the fuck it is that holds all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       But what we're saying is that life is almost completely connected to technology and it's a very, very short time that this has happened 200 years ago. There were no cars, you know, so in those 200 years we have been connected to cars who was, um, a really fascinating video that someone sent me that I put up on Twitter. I retweeted it the other day. You can find it if you just scour through my Twitter, but it's a, a time lapse video of, uh, of cars moving back and forth on freeways and how it looks like blood and the car. Yeah. How it looks like the pulsating of blood coming back and forth, you know, I mean it's, that clearly is the breath of breathing in and breathing out the, you know, the heartbeats in and out the cars, leave the house and come back to the house. I mean, it really is. It really is like, that's crazy. It's a type of life form. It's just, it happens so slowly. All this traffic sucks my Dick, you know, on the fucking my car is dying, shit and all these things that you, you micro manage that, that scenario and then you don't see it as this pulsating thing of of cars coming in and cars going out and how many of them go in the same God damn direction? Yeah, every

Speaker 3:          00:32:10       day. Here's the thing, man, and this is where the, I think about this all the time because the way forever for things to work, the way they're working right now, which is for there to be capitalism and there to be super rich people and super poor people in war and all the things that you know or rather distasteful or seem to be a, I seem to be a destructive for that, to exist. Each of those little nodes of consciousness that represent that bloodstream have to think they're individuals and have to think they're more important than all the other ones. So you've got a bunch of blood cells all thinking, yeah, I got to get to work. What the fuck's wrong with this asshole in front of me? And not realizing they're all part of this one super organism. And if somehow everyone's consciousness shifted from the idea of like, I gotta get to work to whatever the next thing would be, which is I'm connected to this super mind that is the planet, which I think is going to, that's what the singularity will be. It will be some technologically, uh, uh, applied empathy that allows everyone to connect their consciousness to the mother earth. Yeah. That moment capitalism kind of ceases as we know it and capitalism, of course, it's just a, it's a symptom of something deeper. But that, that model, the model that's running everything is no longer possible.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Now, model encourages a competition. Not Model encourages people to push and strive and push beyond their comfort in order to, you know, to create more action and create more money to create more, more building, more construction, more, more things, more prisons, more la, buying more things, more diseases so we can have more realism this out. Yeah. All of it. It all accelerates. They invented diseases. It's a, it's a fascinating thing man. You know, the, uh, the idea that everything moves in the same direction is that the single celled organisms, you know, that, you know, or even how about we look at blood, you know, when you're talking about it looking like a blood moving through arteries, you know, blood is a single cell, you know, single cells of blood move as in the same as this huge animal that has a, you know, billions of cells and not just that but is also a host for all sorts of bacteria and stuff that live inside of our bodies.

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       But we have to, in order to keep it going in the same direction as those cells, we have to have all these different little tools that we use to sort of justify existence. All these different little tools like the love of having your baby. Yeah. The love of orgasms. You know the love of going on stage or of creating something you know or you think about the one thing that's the most satisfying, you know, outside of childbirth and in having your own children is creating, you know, people who don't create things I think as a whole are way less happy than people who do create things. And I know dudes that make pool cues. I know dudes that make belts, they make custom wallets and there's a something that they get when they like, you know, I bought a wallet from this dude and you, you buy a wallet from him and he sells you the wallet and he made it for you and shit. Like there's a smile that he has. Like he created something, he created a piece of artwork and someone else is appreciating a, wow, I love how you did this is wow, this is awesome work. It's so clean and well done. He's like, thank you. I like his effort and his, his creativity have gone into an actual object. And to us that's very, very, very satisfying.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       And then there's the comedy satisfaction that you get for performing mean this all we you and I understand. I mean, I don't understand. I guess it's in music, it's probably just the same thing. You meet, create a song and then people love that song, creating something in. Then what are you doing when you creating something while you're doing the same fucking thing. You're, you're pushing the machine, you're pushing it in your way and your way is making people happy and, and giving people some positive energy by your DVD. And there's an industry behind that and they come see what the clubs, and this is industry behind that. Even behind putting gas in their cars and you know, it's, it's, it's a really, it's amazing how many different pieces are in place. If you, if you take back, if you like, you know, zoom in on the idea of what is creation and creation is taking something from the nothingness and bringing it into the somethingness.

Speaker 5:          00:36:24       And so you sort of become the doorway for something that come from the nothingness into the something that's, so when you're creating, you're actually experiencing as flow through from the infinite into the finite. And that I think that is the feeling that we love so much is that sense of feeling that, that thing when you're working on jokes and all of a sudden it goes from being a drudge to all of a sudden it's like, Holy Shit, you know, it's happening and all of a sudden you get sucked into this weird vacuum and you, you've written for like two hours and it feels like a second. You know, that that sense of being pulled into a momentary current or something's coming out of you that's clearly not necessarily you. That to me is like one of the ultimate. It is, it's the ultimate feeling. And I have the, you know, I think if you go by this idea of this attractor, the, that Mckenna talks about, or this thing that exists and hyperspace that it's what it wants to come through, I send to this universe that wants to express itself through us.

Speaker 5:          00:37:22       And, um, I, I think that's the compulsion that you're talking about. I think that's an alternative viewpoint obviously. Um, there's the cynical way of looking at it. Like, no, no, no, no. That's a natural inclination that people have. Monkeys are curious. This is what we do. We think about things. And every joke that you have was just priest a cumulation of your life experiences and you're figuring out a little bit, congratulations. You're not tapping into the universal consciousness will be ranked back. Sarah Pailin is on the line and we're going to have a nice little sit down with a future president. The United States maybe. Huh? Well let's hope he doesn't fuck anybody that he's not married to buy imaginary rituals. Uh, th the thing about it, but you know what I'm saying, the cynical point of view about the idea of creativity, there's something to that point of view too. You have to address it. You can always go hippie. And um, one of the things, I bet I bounced back and forth. I don't think it is either, but it is a little. Um, I bounced back and forth with the idea of the imagination being a, almost like when you, when you have imagination that the imagination is the real force behind the, the evolution. What imagination is is we think

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       of as like, oh, I can see things. I go and work around problems. I have this idea. But when you imagine an idea, when you imagine a product, do you imagine how to design an engine for a car and you're the first, you know, your Henry Ford or whoever the fuck made the first engine. Yeah. When you're, your imagination has this idea for this thing and then you build it and design it and boom, it's there. That thought what there, there was no thought of that before it existed. It's not that it brought, people were running around thinking of the car and I know what's going to look like. There was no thought of it. You created this or it came to you. There was a something from nothing. Something from, from, what is that from the ether. Something from these. Even if it's just these synapses firing in your mind, where is the, what does the signal, what is the root of this signal to be?

Speaker 1:          00:39:25       So you know, mathematical about it and say, wow, it's just human ingenuity and that's what it is. It's good old sticktuitiveness and you roll up your sleeves and you figure out this world. I want that Henry Ford created a great thing and you know, whilst in there and chop my shadows or news or great felly and federal budgets, neurons sweating. Yeah. You know, I don't necessarily know it's, it is possible that the imagination is something that is information that is out there like the, the idea of the akashic records, the idea of uh, you know, yeah, there's shit out there and then we'll, we are his little antennas and that our, when we tune into something, if we pick up this, this signal for the engine and someone picks that up, excellent. Once that piece is in place, oh and then it flowers and blossoms, like, like a Fibonacci sequence on a fucking a sunflower, you know, it all bursts out, you know, exponentially in certain directions. And then that starts creating more inventions with all, which also burst out. But all of them emanate in the imagination. Initially. All of them have to be thought up auto. All of them have to be created by the human minds, right? Or what the human mind can tune into. There's no

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       play into this universe as a human, but through a pussy and there's no way. Now, there is no way for an idea to come into this universe except through a thought. There's no way for an invention except to come through our mind. Our minds are the, our minds are sort of the creative orifice is through which all innovation, every invention, every idea comes, it's through the human mind. Now, if you want to think that some day you just wake up and you get in the shower and you get lucky enough for your neurons to fire a certain way where you figure out how to reduce the cost of making solar power panels and solve the, uh, you know, the energy problem on the planet. If you want to think that that's an accident, fine. If it helps you, it seems like it helps a lot of people to think that the universe springs from some kind of lightening pole adding plasma or the earth eyes or humor or biological life on the earth. And some people like to think that their neurons

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       get lucky and fire cause they squeeze their brow together in the right way and popped out an idea. But I think you'll find that most of the great creators, they don't think that you know when you write, but is that because the best way to create this and not think about yourself? The best way to create is like when you start thinking about yourself, the ego starts tripping over his own dick and you start thinking about like how cool you are. Yeah. That's like when you see a guy on stage and the guy like obviously thinks she's cool. The worst it's the worst is the feeling is this feeling of gross. Nist is a disconnect and that disconnect also disconnects him from creativity. Whereas if you see a guy on stage and he's just in the moment, man, he doesn't give a fuck. He just tuned into it.

Speaker 5:          00:42:14       It's so compelling and so interesting, you know, so maybe it's a trick, you know what I'm saying? Like maybe this idea that you know that we are tuning into the infinite and that is maybe not, maybe it just requires a certain state of mind to be creative and that state of mind is to avoid the ego. It's also like, like the car, they don't just invent the car, you invent the wheel first and it's because somebody sat there like, Hey, I need to take stone or take heavy thing over here. You know, I understand the intent of that movie. I think it's awesome. Necessity inventions come with necessity. It certainly is. But guess what? Antelopes on event and shit. They keep getting jacked by Jaguars left and right. They're stupid fucks. They never figure it out every year. They never invented Anil mobe car where they can just give the finger to the Jaguar, beep the horn run over the Jaguar babies they see in the road, they can't do it.

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       We can. And the one of the reasons why we can is because we're conscious because we can think and, but what is thinking? The real question is what are, what are all these things firing together, solving problems. What is all that really? Because some people can't solve shit. There's, it's very clear that there's a, there's different types of people. There's people that are super solvers and there's people that can barely solve taking a shit and wiping their ass correctly. There's people that can barely show up for work every day. Everything they do is a fucking mass and they make more people that are just like that. Well, if you think that there's an order to the whole thing, what are those fucks here for? You know, are they here just until robots can become invented to do menial tasks? Is that what it is? Well, yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:43:50       Here's the thing. What you did, this is what you do especially eat them. You think of an IC, you know when things get bad, for sure they think of like the greatest idea ever. Your brain's though. Then he'd get mad cow disease. Try On's will fuck you up. You can, if you cannibalize your candidate, every, the brain, the brain, just the lags, nature, nature's balls and Asshole, they're rates are goes bitch, you got a problem, people brains you fucking crazy pictures. They're delicious. If you look at, if you, so the idea, just to get back to this idea of like where do thoughts come from? Well if you, if you take things out of the temporal perspective and look at things as some unified whole, and by temporal you mean

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       by present and future. Okay. So let's look at the whole thing is like from the perspective, if we could jump out of time and we could look at whatever this event was, let's call it the big bang for now and the series of reactions that happened directly after the Big Bang and those first few seconds that the people at the particle accelerators want to understand. And then you follow that all the way to the condensation of gas. I guess that made matter, an event and the galaxies and the guy. And then you follow all the way that to the first, uh, uh, mix, chemical soup that, whatever that was. And then the DNA starts forming out of that. And then that DNA somehow gets encapsulated in a membrane and we have cells in the cells, gained symbiotic relationships with other cells and become multicellular organisms, which have symbiotic relationships.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       And eventually you end up with us. We still are at basically a DNA trail going all the way back to before DNA to matter, all the way back to this explosion of light. And so a thought is an idea, a merging from infinity from the ultimate explosion trillions of years ago and to the present moment. Now, if that ain't come in from nowhere, I don't know what is, you can say, well no, it's my neurons that did it. Well your neurons did it right now, but you're a chain of super reactions that led to this moment in time when you invented the thing you invented, right? You know, you're not just your neurons, you are connected to the an entire ecosystem and you're connected to a infinite past. You know? And it's just, I guess when you start looking at things that just, you know, there's your 60 year lifespan, I suppose things can start looking pretty grim and Penn and teller ish. But if you really just step out of time and really look at what's going down, it's like it's fucking crazy, man. We got blasted out of some infinite passed and we're like yapping about it right now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       Well, it seems to me that we are passengers on a spaceship that is about three hours from slamming into another planet and we just woke up from hyperspace. Yeah. And we're looking at the maps and we are going, how the fuck did we get here? What are we doing here? Does anybody is a radar online yet? We are starting to decipher radar, sir. But we do have a window and we're moving very close to something. We're not exactly sure what it is. Yeah. And then you know. Exactly. You know what I'm saying? It's like we're waking up in the middle of history right now and all of us are some, at some point in time we're realizing that, oh my God, there were no one has a firm grip on exactly what the fuck is going on. We really are like a space ship about the slam into something.

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       You really are moving. We have massive momentum. We're in a tractor beam. We all keep going. Yeah, we're moving towards that thing. But we're all moving in this certain very tangible, very physical direction. And no one knows exactly why, but everyone keeps it going. And we kind of have to keep it going. I mean, that's one of the beautiful things about materialism and all these different things is that if these things are in place, man, do, you're forced, you know, I'm writing, you know, writing a book and now one of the chapters, it's all about, it's called, um, uh, if you get cancer from your cell phone, your fucking pussy. So maintaining your manhood and ever changing world is the idea of it. That as things become more and more complicated, it's very difficult to be true to your, your nature as a human being, as a man, and that one of the biggest ways that you become a bitch is you get a job and get jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       We'll turn you into a bitch more than anything that a man and counters in his whole life, having a boss, having something that you don't want to do, that becomes most of your life. Most of your life is eight hours a day that you're waking the, the, the, the two plus commuting hours you throw in there, the most of that is it. Shit you don't want to do. Your life becomes mostly what you don't want to do and then once you start getting things and that you have to pay for her car payment or an apartment rental or God forbid, you start fucking shit now the kids and they don't have to pay for them. Yeah. Then you become a real bitch because then you can't say what you want because you're worried about getting fired. You know? I've had people say that to me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       Like you say things like that. Do you ever worry that the UFC is going to say something or do you, well, I'm in the luxurious position where I don't have to worry about that, but God damn, fuck yeah, of course I would, you know, if I was barely getting by and I didn't have money saved up and I didn't have other career paths, you know, being a comedian is the most beautiful fucking thing to ever have as your main occupation because we can always go to that, you know, and we can always speak our mind and if people know they can count on you. Like one of the reasons why this podcast is so successful is because there is no bullshit going on in this podcast. There's a lot of speculation. There's a lot of what ifs. There's a lot of stoner talk, but every fucking thing that I say, I say because I believe it I owl or I'm, I'm being honest about my thoughts, right? Just not a lot of people that are thinking like that in this world. There's not a lot of people who have the luxury with their job to be honest about their points of view all throughout the day.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       But what do you do? And this is something that I always wonder and I share it. You're at this idea that you have I, and you're right, having a job is a form of slavery. When you get locked into the system, you get locked into the machine. But what would the world be like if you applied this philosophy? If everyone on the planet heard you saying that and suddenly left their jobs? Yeah, it would be impossible. Why do we have, we have far too complex society where there's a bunch of shit that needs to get done that nobody wants to do. What is that? Oh, I really want to know, like this is an idea I always want to explore is like what it, what Ha. Okay, let's just say it just for a thought experiment. Everyone on the planet, this thing happens in the spaceship. They all wake up and we're all looking at what we're doing. 90% of what we do is robotic, ritualistic bullshit that that is not allowing us to fully experience life. We'll do it be some good things that would happen. Like government jobs that are completely useless would go away. Like the real stupid jobs that

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       are only in place because the government wants to provide jobs and make government bigger because it's one of the ways they can show they're doing well and helping the economy. You know, that's a, that's a terrible, horrible trap and that would be, those people would be forced to contribute. That would be something you, you're going to now forced to actually have something that you, you know, you're going to give to society and they're going to give you food in return for this thing. You know, they're going to give you clothing, they're going to get you. It's going to be some sort of a system in place. You know the, the real problem though is what about all the shit that nobody wants to do? Right? What about create, what have I'm making computers. What about landscape? Yeah. What are we going to do without, but we're going to only have third world countries that are handling our shit. And this, this entire country becomes a bunch of lay abouts with no jobs.

Speaker 4:          00:51:12       See, that's where it gets fun. There's a lot of people that have jobs that have bosses that love their fucking job. You love being a landscaper or they love the NRA. They love being a true, totally true. But those numbers are pretty small. Yeah, absolutely. Anything. It's 10% I don't think you're 10% of the people I know love their job. Well, I'll tell you, he loves their job. Mcdonald's workers. Have you ever gone into a Mcdonald's? It's like a temple of happiness. Those people are just miserable. Grease stain,

Speaker 5:          00:51:38       the, the, the, the, so, but I, this is, uh, you know, speaking of hippies on the way. That's a good point that you brought up because they're replacing Dunkin Dot Dunkin donuts. They're replacing Mcdonald's employees, the

Speaker 4:          00:51:50       with kiosks. They have that already at del Taco by my house or not. Don't talk at El Pollo Loco and you just go up and it's just like everything's touch screen and you just slide your card and Bam. Now man, cause how many McDonald's customers can read. But you know what the best is, is being able to actually for once order everything exactly how you want to without having to waste the person's time. You know, like, like you order your burger, you're like, yeah, I don't want Manet's. Oh, like mustard ketchup. Yeah. Let's add this. Let's add like your, for once you're actually being able to order shit exactly how you want without making people feel bad anymore. Man, I can't do it. If you see food inc Jesus fucking Christ, watch that and then go have a fucking make rib or whatever

Speaker 5:          00:52:32       card. Yeah, it changed my, uh, my whole philosophy and all that stuff. I still eat fish though. Fuck fish. Flatfish that's all I eat it like burger king or Mcdonald's rather. Are you filet of fish? Lifelong enemy. If the crab really I have no, I feel I did not feel bad about eating crabs. Crabs suck. But like, I don't feel bad about eating seafood. I can't feel sorry for fish. It's really difficult. You don't take care of their young, so I need to know about fish. They eat other fish. They eat other fish. Dethroned by the way, you can catch bash all you can catch bass on little tiny bass. [inaudible] it look like bass. We can catch them. They eat little baby bass. The moment cons. You eat your own species. Yeah. I don't feel bad eating here. Yeah, they'd shit their shit. The rugs out. The guy comes over. It doesn't mean fuck the girl. Just Jesus all over the eggs. It's like what kind of a stupid, they're so disconnected you them perverts. If the seat, well they can't stop for even a second. Even the fuck there's no time and your soul is going to come along and eat your ass. Some eggs on the world of the, of the ocean and of lakes is so fantastic and bizarre and and really alien to us. Hedberg I have a joke about how awful the ocean would be. A fish gets scream.

Speaker 5:          00:53:50       It wouldn't be mad. You think about it, everybody's a murderer. Even whales, a murderers, wells go around eating krill. You know there's very few vegetarian fish and it doesn't matter because even the, whatever vegetarian foods there are, they get killed. I mean the ones that do exist that eat algae and shit like that, you just there to clean up bitch and then every now and then someone's going to come around and eat your ass, chomp out an experimental chomp. How often does a shark, a human swimming? They don't like getting humans, but they take an experimental bike, they're hungry, they're hungry and you're easy and the rest of the world is moving very fast and leave this fucking stupid thing with rubber flippers. It's barely moving just like this fucking thing real quick. It's like eating like something out of your refrigerator that you're just like, man, maybe it's still good.

Speaker 5:          00:54:36       I don't surf. I have friends that do it and they say it's the most amazing thing of all time, but fucking man, every year someone gets jacked. I was using the analogy that if every year someone got attacked by the wolf man, would you still go in the woods during a full moon? Now, why the fuck would you? Well guess what? Sharks are way scarier than the god Damn Wolf Man. Cause they're real and they don't take days off. It's not like, oh it's on a full moon. We don't have to worry. We can go swimming in the ocean now know every fucking day sharks are out there and they're way scarier than Werewolf. But isn't it like the odds of you getting in a shark attack like your, your, your odds will be better if you know, getting hit by like a meteor or something.

Speaker 5:          00:55:13       Like do you know what, you know, they're not that small. It depends on where you're at. If you go to South Africa that your odds are very high that you're going to get bit by sharks. There's an area in South Africa where they can drag a surfboard behind a boat and there's videos of it cause it's that fucked up cause they have a huge population in South Africa of great white sharks. And People Go fucking surfing out there, man. And you'll drag a boat or drag a surfboard behind a great white or brown behind a boat and a great way would just come along and nail it. They had one, they dragged it, didn't just dragged it for like five minutes. Three sharks nailed it in five minutes. It's heroin. And one of the, one of the, aside from being permanently crippled and terrified at the seed for the rest of your life, one of the awful things about being a shark attack victim is always hearing that fucking statistic. My odds of getting bitten by a shark and you're looking at your stub like, yeah, fuck that statistic. I got uh, my, my arm ripped off dude. Recently a write up in Santa Barbara that got bitten half, he a hundred yards from shore swimming with his buddies in a 16 foot great white came along and bid him in half. And they were like, well, it's real rare for shark like that to exist in this part of the world. Yeah. What the fuck are you talking about? Just because it's

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       rare. It's still the ocean. It's all connected. Yeah. The ocean is one big playing field. Okay. There's no nets. There's the occasionally nets for fish of course, but there's nothing that separates this part of the fucking field from the other part of the field. There's just habitat and they choose if they want to, they can keep swimming. They can take a chance. They're in a certain area for a reason. It's because the food sources there, but guess what? There's a reason why with some killer whales are up near Alaska us cause they found a fucking food source. They wandered that area, started killing things there and said I was a good spot. Now Shit moves man. Ocean is like a giant buffet tray and when you go into a, you become part of the buffet. Whether you like it or not, you're your anything in the ocean could eat you and there's so many things that would love to that.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       That last moment, dude, that's what I think about. You're out there swimming, body surf and having fun. You see your girl on the shore, hey, you're swimming. Then all of a sudden it feels like somebody punched you really hard in the leg and then you look down and there's just blood guys are hanging out at your fucking ripped arteries and there's just, there's just some white shape underneath you carrying your leg off to Atlanta has and that and you know what I mean? That's your last moment as you sink under the waves and suck in water because he lost so much blood. Maybe you wake up in the hospital two days later. Right. But you know what, how is that any better than the cows last day when that fucking pissed and goes to his brain a couple of days before you eat them in a cheeseburger. Not a good last day.

Speaker 2:          00:57:55       Last Day. Everybody's last day. Sox Win. Not necessarily really. You think your last day is going to be the shit? I think that there, well, I mean yes because it depends on how you do it, I guess. Depends on how you do it, but some key survival stash of mushrooms around, you know, like a real, like a 10 gram stash that you can just bust into it every time. Then you'll like this, this mother fucker. It looks like it's, yeah, this is it. You know, I'm, I'm drowning in my own lung fluid here. You know, my, my, my feet or black with rot. Okay, it's over. I can't breathe. We just chew down these mushrooms real quick. Just like fucking out of this HUD families like, father, please don't do it. Don't take those things. Don't take those things. We want you here when you're dying. Leave us. You're just trying to have a nice little mushroom trip before you blast off.

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       You know, out of this Huxley on his deathbed wrote because he couldn't talk on a sheet of paper, the medical prescription for 500 micrograms of LSD intravenously, which his wife injected and do him on his deathbed. He's the guy who wrote brave new world. Oh my God, I'm not tripping. Wow. Have you heard of Bitcoin? What have you heard of Bitcoin? Spell it. B. I. T. C. O I n no, it's this new peer to peer currency that's going on the Internet right now. It's kind of based off of Torrance. You know, I know what you're talking about. You're talking about that psychedelic store where you can buy anything you want. I don't, I was wondering if you guys knew about that. There's a store that if you set up your computer

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       correctly, like you have to put like some kind of make it random like IP addresses so it's not trackable. Then you can access to this access as one website called the silk roads. Yeah, and you can pretty much buy any drug you want to. And these guys have been buying acid. They're using bitcoins though, so it's even more untraceable. Is it really untraceable I doubt it. Yeah. I think I, I think anyone could fuck, yeah, it seems like the dumbest age of wired for those folks who don't know what we're,

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       well if you just Google, this is the phrase to Google, the underground website where you can buy any drug imaginable. If you Google that, it'll come up a bunch of different articles from bunch of different publications. I read the one in wired magazine, which just one of my favorite online things to read. I use Gawker Gawker's awesome too. Uh, but basically what they're saying is that, you know, it describes a guy who did it. It's this guy here, I'll describe it. Three weeks ago, US Postal Service delivered an ordinary envelope to Mark's door. Inside was a tiny plastic bag containing 10 tabs of LSD. If you had opened it, unless you were looking for it, you wouldn't have even noticed mark, a software developer had ordered 100 micrograms of acid through a listing in the online marketplace. Silk Road. He found a seller with lots of good feedback who seemed to know what they were talking about. Added the acid to his digital shopping car and hit checkout. He entered his address and paid the seller 50 bitcoins, untraceable digital currency worth about $150. Four days later, the drugs sent from Canada arrived at his house.

Speaker 5:          01:00:55       Um, what was the website that you order? The LSD. That seems to me like this is one of those things that was a great idea for a little, but until everybody started talking about until Gawker put it on their front page. Yeah. Or wired. It's actually emanated from Gawker. I did like the idea of bitcoin. So trying to start a currency, you know, outside of the normal currency, you got it. You got to have balls to order LSD. That I would start off with Tylenol pm and then work my way up cause you gotta give me your address. I'm going to no matter what. That seems just crazy. I couldn't enjoy that. I do the acid you'd get so God damn paranoid that someone was going to boot down your door and fucking stick a gun in your mouth while you're sleeping and scream at you.

Speaker 5:          01:01:42       Where's the fucking drug? Shoot your dog. You know, I mean, did you hear about the DEA raid and fucking, I think it was an Arizona. We're a guy who was a former marine, was a gun down in a, in an ill conceived drug raid. They shot him 71 times. He had a little Baggie of weakness house. Yeah, I heard of that. Yeah, that's, that's the kind of shit that are really killed. Hi. Yeah, no shit. That shit kills my eye anyway. That's like it. That's how I know I'm about to have a bad trip. Is that the fantasy swat team starts. It's surrounding the house. Well that's the problem also in environments where drugs are illegal, psychedelic drugs, marijuana where those things that

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       you'd want and are nice and they're illegal end. When you buy them, you have to be in contact with bad people. You have to be in contact with drug dealers. You have to be in contact with people who are willing, willing to risk going to jail to sell you this shit. And a lot of times these fucking guys get popped and a lot of times maybe they don't like you. So when they get popped and they have to talk to the cops, the cops is, where are you getting this shit from? Hey, I'm buying this from this former marine man. This guy's fucking crazy. You know, he's got a gun and he's selling coke at his house. And so what did the cops do? Well they said, well we've got to fucking far marine and coke and the guy's crazy and he's got guns. We need to get the swat team together, put on the vest and the helmets. And so then they fucking gun this guy down when really maybe all it was is he knew a shithead cause that's where he bought his pot. You know who the fuck knows? I mean I'm reading into the whole thing. He might've been crazy, but when you, my point is when you're dealing with the world of illegal drugs, you're dealing with criminals. Right. And that's, that's one of the biggest travesties of, you know, the, the having these personal freedoms taken away from us is that it's forcing you to interact with people.

Speaker 3:          01:03:22       We're at a father fucking mind. But that's the annoying thing. Yeah. Cause you know, you hear, listen, marijuana is a gateway drug. You start smoking marijuana, you're going to have a heroin needle hanging out your arm by Christmas. But it's like really marijuana is not a gateway drug. Drug dealers are gateway drugs. And when a kid can't go to a store that solely sells marijuana and goes to a dope dealer in some trailer, North Carolina, like where I used to go, the guy's like, hey boy, you want to, but you want to try and get an eight ball on top of that. It's great coke. And then the next thing you know you're like, oh sure, why not? I'll try some coke or I'll try some meth.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       That's one way you're looking at it. But I could see that someone who's curious and tries marijuana would eventually be curious and try heroin or be curious and try math. Or you know, if they have friends that are dumb, especially if you're young, it's very deep. If you do math, I know this person that fucking moron, you are a fucking moron. But what of your dumb and what a few young and what if you have a friend who just did math and he's like, it was crazy. It was wild. I thought you get hooked. No, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine. And you're dominant. You listened to your dumb friend and then boom, you're doing math. You know, I can see that, I can see that, but it still doesn't take away from the fact that one of the main problems is that we have this distrust of the, uh, the, the entire system.

Speaker 1:          01:04:34       We have a distrust of the police and the law enforcement, distrust of the lawmakers. And one of the big reasons for this distrust is marijuana laws. We know they're ridiculous. They know they're ridiculous. It's 2000 fucking 11. And you go online and you look up the statistics and you look up all the studies. You go, well, hey, this shit isn't deadly at all. Not always. It's not deadly. It seems to shrink tumors. And look, it seems to help people with add and it seems to help children. When you go online, you find the information. It's so completely diametrically opposite of what they're fucking telling you and beaten your, your, your head. And with that you start to disregard what they say about other shit too. And then you try math because you say, well fuck, they were lying to me about weed. Maybe methane that bad. You know, maybe coke's

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       not a big deal. And then all these fucking terrible, really dangerous drugs that are, I don't know if you've had a friend that has had an addiction problem and been there weather while they're in the throes of addiction. It's like having a friend that's bit by a vampire. Yeah, it really is. It's like you can't do anything for them. You can't, you're, you're holding them down. Their fangs are popping out and it's like you see them shaking. Shuddering sweating. What did you, what was your friend? What happened? What did you have a, my friend was addicted to Vicodin and I went over to his house because he's like, can you come get rid of my Vicodin? And I'm like, I'll be right over because it is, I love biking. It has a good friend. You went through a period of time where you got a bunch of pills and you got real weird for a while.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       Man, I dunno what the fuck you were taken, but you took too much of it and you kept taking it. You were telling me, dude, if I have it in my house, I just take them. Yeah. It's like world of Warcraft, I to flush them down the toilet. What was it? What were they? Well, so what had happened is a friend of mine who really isn't, I clearly probably not the night sky, just gave me a fucking handful, a shitload of pills, like its own weird mixture of pills. So like I, I think I was a little depressed at the time and like listening to a lot of Elliot Smith. Oh No, it's okay. Go stab themselves today. Yeah. So like I went, I was living in echo park and have these pills and I go into my depressed little apartment, like eat pills. It was really it

Speaker 3:          01:06:44       dark time, man. And, and, and uh, and I got sick. I wouldn't, I guess you could say, I don't think I got physically addicted. I don't think I got a habit, but I got a little psychologically addicted and I got scared because I could see the, you know, the fucking, I could feel the pole, so I flushed them down the toilet.

Speaker 2:          01:07:02       Wow. That's a smart move. That's it. Hard move to make though, right? You were at the door of addiction, right?

Speaker 3:          01:07:08       Yeah. And I could feel, I could, I could see where it could go. Um, and that's why fucking pills suck. And that's why you should avoid them at all costs because they fucking suck. I, you know, I just threw my back out and my dad gave me some pain medication, which I took and this is the first time I've taken like a pharmaceutical pain killer and a long time and I hated it. It just made me feel like shit, I was puking yesterday. I don't know if that it was from that or the fact that we had pregnant old shell fish or I'm pregnant, but like those things suck, man. Uh, all pills, uh, suck. They're terrible for you, but they're awful for you. Outside of like, you know, Xanax and Oxycontin, which I still use every day.

Speaker 2:          01:07:54       I do, I did kind of see your, your drug, your drug dealer giving you kind of like the gateway thing. I know a friend that allegedly recently went to go get mushrooms and this person has only done we'd and mushrooms and their whole life. And the first thing the guy says, hey, I got some DMT right now also. And it was like, can you imagine just giving somebody TMT

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       going from like, oh, what's the DMT? I'll try that. That shit's all my fault. I Know Jeff, you started a DMT explosion. Crazy. But I did. How often do you get emails from fake cops? Probably every day. I don't, I can't respond to emails anymore. It's impossible. I get too many of them. So don't even try. I do what I can to respond to Twitter messages and nice short form things and talk to people outside of clubs, you know, after shows and stuff like that. But there's just too many people wanting my time and too many crazy fucking people. But there's definitely fake cops. There's definitely other cops. Fake people returning to your cops, I'm sure. But look, it's real simple. I always say like, I don't travel with it. I don't, I don't, uh, you know, I'm not looking to get high and other towns, I'm not looking at, you know, get fucked up on mushrooms in Seattle.

Speaker 5:          01:09:01       I'm not, I'm not doing anything stupid. And I have a respect for law enforcement. I know that they know these laws are retarded. I have no, a lot of cops, man, believe me. What they hate is criminals. They hate scumbags and murderers and people knocking over fucking people stores and houses and stealing and making societies suck. And a lot of that is drug dealers too because as we said, you know, people were willing to take those fucking chances to sell drugs. A lot of times they're doing that because they were doing something else before. They had some fucking pyramid scheme before that and before that they were, you know, selling stolen car radios or there's a lot of people involved. When you get involved in that illegal world, the world of Shit that can get you locked up in jail. There's a lot of people that only operate inside that realm.

Speaker 5:          01:09:45       You know, they go from one little illegal scam to the next cops hate them and they should for a fucking reason. I personally like cops, you know, people think that because I like pot, I don't like cops. Cops to me are a huge fucking important part of a healthy and safe society. And when you hear about bad cops, I personally believe that it's a, a small fraction of the actual cops. Most cops are, they behaved admirably in front of a bunch of fucking cunts. Cause that's what most people are. Most people are dumb cunts and they're out there doing dumb stupid shit. And these cops running these dumb cons doing dumb stupid shit all day fucking long. Every day of the week. I admire their fucking patients for the most part. By the way, I'd love to see the cop painters out there cause I think fallen apart in you're ready because the way you handle it.

Speaker 5:          01:10:34       No, I just tend just touch them. I like that. And it did it. It's fine. You sit right on top of your belly too. Maybe you should like back that bitch up a little bit. So you know there's some space between me and the microphone. I'd love to see, I'd love to see what a copywriter does when they're fucking house gets broken into. Yeah. Cops. Some cops are bad man. I know a guy who was selling weed who got robbed by cops. Don't think I've talked about it on the podcast. I've never had a problem with cops. I think if you have a problem with cops for the most part, watch the show cops and you'll realize what these cops are dealing with. They, they seem pretty nice and then they're dealing with it, but like you said, a bunch of fucking retards or watch Steven Seagal law. Man, what the fuck is he doing? He's a cop. He just busted

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       a cock fighting ring and Arizona. They bridged, drove into a house with the fucking tank and they busted people fighting roosters. Steven, look, dog gets out. This is real life, man. He's so strange to me. God is no one more bizarre to me and Steven Seagal. It's hilarious. Why did he drive into a chicken house to the tank? Well, I did our TV. Why did real cops let him come to a bust? The whole thing. I mean, I guess he's some sort of a weird real cop in Louisiana I guess. I don't even think he is. I think he just shadows them or something like that. I think he's like an honorary sort of a thing. Like Shaq was Shaquille O'Neal was like an honorary sheriff. Well he loves chickens. Shaquille O'Neal, Steven to, he just loves chickens. These are my precious, these are God's children. I don't give a fuck about birds either.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       Birds to me are just like fish. I have a pen. Go fuck themselves. Guilty eating chickens cause those little, those little fucking orange checks. There's Tony chicks eat chickens. Chickens are cunts. Once they become full grown, their cuts chop their fucking heads off and cook them up. I don't have no problem with eating chickens. They're cold blooded assholes. They don't give a fuck about you slap a chicken. I do jokes about birds like people. So like saying that the apocalypse and the birds are falling from the sky as the apocalypse and I'm like, you don't know if people were falling from the sky, it would be the apocalypse. Like birds. I said my pet bird, the moment he died, that thing's going to eat your fucking eyeballs about you, man. Let it shitheads something happened and saw that fucking offered Hitchcock movie the birds. I just watched that today's I got, that's happened to birds.

Speaker 2:          01:12:53       Hey, have you seen somebody back then didn't have a fucking shotgun? That that is the dumbest fucking movie. If there was common sense, that movie would not exist if it was so retarded that there were so many, like just watching it. Like, why don't you just fucking get in that room and don't move? Why are you having bird attacks and you're scared of birds, but you're still going outside at all. You know what I mean? They, every time somebody went outside, somebody died. Oh, how come nobody's got a goddamn tennis racket up in this bitch? I'll tell you what, these are only crows are right. If it was crows outside, oh fuck. Off Off Hosan Crows. I'll go out there with a, a goalie mask on and uh, some sparring gear like to cover up all my vital areas and a cop and to tennis rackets, and I'll take on a swarm of birds.

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       I'll just swap those pitches out of the sky. It would be an awesome workout. Cro advocate here, if a big enough flock of crows descended on you, yes. They could carry you away. That's true. Yes it was. Because what happened? I would be a whirling dervish like a fucking tornado of tennis racquets or you're going to get swooped into. That may be you, but I got some cardio bitch. I work out. The real product would be if it was eagles, if you had a swarm of eagles, you're dead dead. Never seen the videos of eagles killing wolves.

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       Yup. Yeah. What the fuck did you know? They train them to kill wolves because they get the wolf furs and they sell like wolf pelts are worth a lot of money because you know a lot of the guys where they do it, you know they're, they're farmers and shit and they have sheep and the wolves come and eat the sheep. So they, they, they train eagles to kill the wolves. And I would've never believed it was so easy. These eagles are like undefeated versus walls feel sorry for the world. That's incredible. Feel bad for the, they swooped down and they just Jack. These motherfuckers grab them by their necks and you realize like an eagle has like they have like five fucking knives in each hand. You know how many closets they have? I don't have feet. I don't know. Four. Let's go. Let's go with, you can see on the Internet, but they in basically they have some fucking wolverine type weapon and they just grab the neck of this wolf and just fuck him up, man.

Speaker 5:          01:15:04       Yeah, but it's not just that. It seems like they get them by the neck and then they plunge their beacon to him. They just, oh, their beak is a murderous weapon. A Cessna stone. When I watched birds that I thought the blonde chick was so hot in that movie that I was like online trying to find out if she was alive. Five. You ever thought like leg fucking somebody that was so desirable back in the day and it still fucking hurt just because of who's just used to be, a lot of guys are still doing that. I would fuck that girl. You ever watch a celebrity rehab this this season? I think so. You know, Janice Dickinson, she's that model who's a, seems like a troubled lady. I'm sure she's a nice person, but she's got a lot of issues and she's always like fucked up and Rehab and she's got a lot of plastic surgery and she's got this young boyfriend and his boyfriend is like really not a very good looking guy and he shouldn't be with Janice tickets.

Speaker 5:          01:15:53       You know, if Janice Dickinson was 20 there's no way she'd be with this fucking dude. But you know, he's 30 and she's 50 or whatever the fuck she is. And he's, you know, he's with Janice Dickinson, that plastic surgery phase that all droop. She's got like early eighties plastic surgery or they hadn't, it hadn't evolved to where it's at. So it's kind of fallen off the blonde checks daughter with somebody like Melanie Griffin or something like that too. I was, I was like, wow, really? Yeah, I hate those puffed lips now. And people so say gel in their lips. Friend of mine, his wife did that and I had a conversation with her and I had to avoid looking at it while we're talking. I'm like, oh gross that you expect an alien to pop out of it. It was so weird. She had just done it, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:16:35       Have you ever had a time to have three and then the bottom one, that's what it seems like the wolves have. There's a video online called Golden Eagle domination. It's just eagles fucking up everything. Fucking of wolves and rabbits and just swooping down and snatching things. I got to see a few of those fly when I lived in Colorado, I saw a golden eagles. They actually live there. You can catch them in the woods. Um, yeah, they're, they're pretty scary man. That whenever I see them fly over, I always think of it, decided to attack me, take my eyes at this video should showed one just ate a fucking Turkey and then one just caught a deer. There's a dare, some murderous mother fuckers. Man, there's a Fox jacked. This is just an all, there's the wolf hope. Fuck man. Watch this shit. Watch a shit.

Speaker 5:          01:17:25       Yeah, dude, you're going to freak freak out, man. They're so big. We don't realize how big they are. First of all, look at this. God takes the wolf down and grabs him by the neck and just kills his ass. You don't realize how big these fucking things are. Look at this man. Look at that. He flipped him over and the poor. Whoa. Look at that. Boom Dude. They kill wolves. Wow. The natural world is so scary, man. There's so much crazy shit going on in the natural world. Yeah. It's like a big barroom brawl that she's been going on for after constant fight, but I mean the, the, the really nutty thing that our little pea brains is the idea that almost everything in the world eats and kills everything else with its face, the most intimate way possible to grabs things in with it's fucking face.

Speaker 5:          01:18:15       Just reps things apart and that's no, that's how life, that's how life passes on. That's the cycle of life. The cycle of life, his teeth and claws and just murder and tearing with your face. Yeah. Wrestle it down. Get your face inside. It's rib cage and eat its heart. Does Golden Eagle is a bad motherfucker now he's pulling goats off of cliffs ever. See when they do that, they pull them off cliffs and just drop them on the rock. Which is that, this is something I've wondered about that. What did they do it that's like a tool that they use or is that, did that guy just catch an accident happening? Well, they do it a lot. It's, it's, it's common but it's also a product of the environment where they're fighting them. If they were on, it looks to me like to do an an on purpose, but it also could be that the trying to pick them up, but they're doing it over and over and over again.

Speaker 5:          01:19:05       But it also where they're fighting or they're trying to kill these things and fly off with them. I mean it's in a a crazy spot where if you go six inches to the right or six inches to the left, you're going to fall 3000 fucking feet is this one's flying off with one, but then he gets to the bottom and he lets it go. So I think they're trying to fly off with them. But Eagles are such evil fuck eds that they'd try to bite off shit that they can't even carry. They try to like claw into this big, big goat and fly away with it and they can't. So like all right, well I'll just see at the bottom and just drop it. You look at this, this one, a tax a bear. Well it's good for, the energy's good there. You know, you're expending fewer calories and that's like, isn't that what it's all about when you're an animal, you're conserving energy and trying to get, trying to get more energy before you run out. We are so lucky. There's no Mortera doctorals uh, could you imagine, cause that's what a fucking bird is by the way, which people don't understand is that a bird is a dinosaur. That is the direct descendants of dinosaurs. They are the closest

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       thing that we have to understanding what real dinosaurs look like for that things. Do they run times? Did you know about that? Yeah. Chickens will grow Fang sometimes. Wow. Fucking hate chickens. They think a lot of dinosaurs actually had feathers to dinosaurs that existed even in, uh, you know, the, the pre 65 million years period where the, the, the thing hit. They had feathers. I wish I could, or accord at the time. Eddie Griffin explained to me how dinosaurs super intelligent creatures, Eddie Griffin, he explained to me how Bruce Lee died once. He told me, he talks to me for like 20 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       He came in the room and there was a hundred other motherfuckers in this room and Bruce Lee looked at all them bitches and said, which one of y'all niggas wants a dot first and then they all came at him and they could not get close enough because his feet and his hand was moving so fast. These pitches was just dropping left and right. But they had a chill day. Had to kill him, would poison season if I couldn't get a call to him, he had to kill him. The poison. And I'm sitting there listening to this call. Oh my God. And I'm trying to remember in my head, I wish I knew how Bruce Lee died. Yeah, I could tell him cause I felt like he died like of a drug overdose or something. What does Bruce Lee's actual deaf. I don't know because, hold on one second. Bruce Lee. Firstly. Yeah. How did he die? I thought he got murdered. Didn't know Brandon leave at Bruceton Brandon. We got like, it was supposed to be a blank. Yeah. I thought Bruce Peace

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       inside of it. Oh, let's see. How did his, how did he die? Die, Die, die, die, die. Appreciate. I should know this man death. Here we go. Bam. I mean, he collapsed in while doing dubbing work, suffering from seizures and headaches. He was immediately rushed to the Hong Kong Baptist hospital where doctors his cerebral edema. So that's bleeding of the brain, right? They were able to reduce swelling through the administration of a man, a tall whatever the fuck that is, uh, the same symptoms that occurred in his first collapse. We're later repeated on the day of his death. So he started having a bleeding of the brain apparently. You know, who knows the man that could have been from kicks to the head. Yeah, it's very possible. Um, he did a lot of stunt work and the, the reality of movies is that you get fucked up.

Speaker 1:          01:22:23       Brock. A, I mean, not Brock Lesnar Bas Rutten was telling us about how he got injured on the set of that show lights out. Remember he was talking about him or his arm? His one arm that's smaller than the other arms. We just had, I just did a movie with him. I just said this here come the boom movie. So it was hanging out with him for a couple of weeks and he had um, surgery where they open up his nerve canals because his nerves were compressed and they like atrophied his muscles and his arms stop working correctly. Yeah, it's pretty fucking serious shit man. This is all from just stunt work, just doing his own stunts on this, this TV show course and Bruce Lee was, you know, he was doing movies. We're dudes, we're swinging sticks at him and nunchucks and throwing

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       kicks at his head and punches. Guess what man? Shit's lips and things happen. Man. Did you see that tweet? Someone sent to us about the, I think it was in the UK. This woman's slapped a Dj on a bat and killed him. She punched him. Oh, she punched him for $5. Five bucks. Yeah. And he died, dropped him and in Santa Monica in front of, Oh, a guy pushed another guy down, killed him. He hit his head or he went into a coma. He fell on the sidewalk. It just went into a coma and are trying to find the guy. My buddy, my buddy was living on long island and he was a, he's a standup comic and he was a bouncer at the time, you know, uh, it was like, you know, for, for extra money. And one of the guys that he worked with just punched a guy.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       The guy was drunk. I got loud, guy punched him, guy fell back, hit his head, dead, dead. Wow, you're in jail now. Well, your body is fucking fragile, man. You know, I'm amazed at all the shit that I've seen. I've never seen anybody die in all my years of competition and all my years of, of, of watching UFC fights, I've seen some close calls though, man. We fought in a tournament once at the bay state games in 1986. And the, when you have no regulation, like a sport like taekwondo, taekwondo has very little like local regulation. You're allowed to have these tournaments where you, you have high school gymnasiums and you fill them up with people and they're fighting on hardwood floors and they're kicking full blast to the face and getting knocked the fuck out. And people getting knocked out and falling unconscious and slamming their head off the ground and they have, might have an EMT there to watch out for you to help you when your brain is bleeding through your ears and nose.

Speaker 5:          01:24:42       And um, so we fought in this one and the arena was a thin piece of nylon, like a, uh, like a competition area that they would lay out. Their wood was marked with a square, with a circle in the square over a frozen, like an ice skating rink that was thought out. So it was cement. It was just straight cement with a thin layer of vinyl, which was the competition area. So we fought on cement. Wow. Yeah. And no one ever, someone should've died. Someone got hurt. I knocked the guy out and he fell forward and he smashed his face on this because he broke his eyebrow open. His biggest injury was his, uh, his eyebrow more than I kicked him on the other side of the head. I kicked him on his, um, uh, kicked him with a wheel kick. So that was his right side of his head and he fell on his left side of his face got fucked up.

Speaker 5:          01:25:32       Well, you know the thing man, where like, there was like a certain amount of time it took to run a mile. You know, there is like, I don't remember what it was, but that time keeps getting shorter and shorter and shorter as humans evolve eventually because of the UFC, some ways he's going to develop enough punching strength to punch through someone's face and to their brain. That's going to fucking happen, man. Someone's going to get the punch. Someone's going to punch like a watermelon right into someone's like a movie fucking head. That's going to happen. They're going to develop this drink. They're going to learn the training and it's going to happen in front of millions of people, and that's the end of the UFC. Really think that's going to happen to your hand will fuck up. That's not what they said about the mile. They were like, they're still, we've gotten a lot better at taking it to people.

Speaker 5:          01:26:14       Gotten not just better at throwing punches. They got better at taking punches too. There's a certain amount of pounds that it would take to punch through a human head. Someone knows that there's a certain amount of pounds and the same way there's a certain amount of time they thought someone could run a mile in. Someone is going to turn someone's head into a fucking glove on front of millions of people. It's going to make the worst sound you've ever heard in your life. We'll hear rogue and he'll go, ah, you'll hear a scream. Everyone will scream and this guy I'll just be looking down and it'll look like it's fucking fist is in a strawberry pie face. That's going to happen man. And then the UFC, they're going to have to start wearing like helmets or something. Well that was one of the proposals that people have proposed helmets, super proposed, all sorts of crazy thing.

Speaker 5:          01:26:56       Helmets like your cycle or cycle? The whole, well I think they were thinking about like contact sports, like football or football players have to helmets. Yeah. But you know, it's been kind of statistically proven at least when in comparison with rugby, which is a pretty God damn violent game that rugby players suffer less brain traumas and football players do because football players, because they're wearing those helmets, they just feel like they can just charge right the fuck at union and smash heads. Whereas you know there's a real repercussion for bone to bone contact, head to head. But that helmet man just gives you that feeling of protection. But what doesn't get protected as the brain? The brain inside rattles around like a fucking, like a jumping bean, a little sack of Jello that was attached to the walls with thin string, you know, and then snap, snap slosh slosh.

Speaker 5:          01:27:43       I'm thinking how strong the brain is that like imagine if like you, if like you punched your hard drive, like it would never work again. It's like our brains get slammed around and they still work. Yeah. It's amazing how much trauma the brain can take. By the way, man, if they start making people wear football helmets for the UFC, it will be the funniest sport on a planet to see guys in Speedos with the flooring. The weirdest looking. Well when then someone will rupture someone's liver with a kick and then body armor, you know, and talking about no tournaments. We used to have the where these body things. He's like chest protectors right now because they thought people kick too hard. The body, it was certain kicks you still even the chest protector on your fucked. If so many hits me, the turning side kick to the body with a chest protector on, that's not good enough.

Speaker 5:          01:28:27       Sign up protection. Like you hold pads for someone. You know, if you hold Moy Thai pads, they're like a big thick pad and you know you slam into them and still some guys where they kick all, you hold that shit for Bas Rutten he'll kick right to that pat. It'll fucking hurt man. And that's a big ass thick pad. The thing about that little ass thin thing that they put on their body and talking window tournament. So if someone in a Shin kick, like a roundhouse kick that they would do to a tie, pat is nothing compared to like a spinning kick, right? When you can spin your body and really get that, that fucking that torque into it, whether it turning side kick, it's just there's so much power that can be developed

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       by martial arts techniques. It is kind of amazing. No one's ever died. It's gonna. Well No, I think that is the UFC. 50 years from now, something's going to have to change because it's going to be people punching through faces. People, someone's going to kick right into someone's stomach, Paul back and just a coil of intestines. Just wrapped her legs break. I've only seen one in person live, but it was a trip, man. It was Corey Hill. This dude is 155 pounds and he was like six one or six two. It was really tall and skinny. I mean he's like a beanstalk man, like amazing aided looking and he threw a kick and the dude check the kick and his leg just snapped. Just like in those videos that you see online, you've seen a bunch of them alive. Yeah, Dad. I never saw that growing up.

Speaker 2:          01:29:48       Never saw that man. I saw Moy Thai fights. I saw kickboxing matches. I never saw anybody break a leg. But as soon as the internet came along he just slept. You know like oh it's happening. It's not that often, but yeah, it happens, man. I that's like one of the worst acid trips in my life. When I was in college, I was, I was on acid and I'm with my friend and I was downstairs playing ping pong with somebody having the, it was like going to be a star spangled trip. You know where you can tell where just like this is awesome. You're feeling great. We're playing ping pong. God, life is beautiful. I love my friend comes down the stairs. It's face. Why does it ghost stumbles into the ping pong table, knocks it down. He's like, I broke my arm man. And He'd been outside skateboarding and just fell on his arm and snapped his arm.

Speaker 2:          01:30:33       And then that was like, you know, entering in a six hours of hell is my tripping friend. Had to go to the hospital and get a cast put on his arm. So he was tripping and his arm was, well Joey Diaz is a way we're story. I'm sure you know Joey Diaz was tripping when he found his mom did. Uh, yeah, I'll take a broken arm over that every day. Especially when you 13. Oh, I've had my arm break. I haven't had my mom when you're 13 probably tripping for the hundredth time to have these 13 hey, if you guys can I, this is kind of off subject and if you've seen it, I don't even know if you can play it legally, but if you guys seen the widest kids, you know, pledge of allegiance sketch. No. Can we play that? Is that okay to play it? Are we allowed to again, because we're on Sirius now. Ah, it's so good. God dammit. It's get started Aaron on serious last week. So this is probably, we get sued or they buy insurance and everything for that jam. Yeah, you gotta be very careful that as that I got a Thai massage the other day was first massage I ever had

Speaker 4:          01:31:33       and it's so weird how, how [inaudible] this stranger like climbs up on that first they turn off all the lights and your lay there and you're only in your underwear and this little Asian girl just jumps on you came and see who she is. She's jumping on you and just like rubbing every part of her body against your body. And she had her, both of her hands down my pants, just like go like massaging my ass like two inch be beside my asshole. And then there was this one point where she had me in like this weird commerce Sutro thing where she had to her my legs up and like been around her and like it was like having sex with somebody but not having sex. And at the end of it I wanted to fuck this girl and I didn't even know what she looked.

Speaker 4:          01:32:15       Where's the parlor? Where is this? Uh, this was just burping. That's the only reason I didn't get fucked. So if it was outside of Burbank, I'm sure that I check would have like, it sounded finished me off or something because that was, she was pretty close though. It was an hour and a half of just this girl. If you're not getting laid out there, go get yourself a $50 Thai massage and find it the sketchiest neighborhood. You can man that. That was awesome. I wish I knew about that when I was 18 years old. I would be getting one of those once a week or so. Good for you. You should get them.

Speaker 1:          01:32:45       I should. I don't, but you know what? I started lifting weights really heavy again. I had this guy, Steve Maxwell, who's is a world famous strength and conditioning coach. He's a friend of mine and I've worked out with him a bunch of times and he flew in just to work out with me for two days and it, you know, and he put me through two hours of incredibly brutal shit like yesterday and the day before, two days in a row. Unbelief. You feel fucking fantastic when it's over though. You feel like further where you feel fucking completely exhausted but your body, you feel like fuck if I do this, if I do this two or three days a week, every week I will be a fucking superhero. You know, he just, cause he's got me doing all kinds of crazy kettlebell swings and all these clean and jerks and all the strong man shit is crazy different fucking exercises. But he said one of the most important things is you need to get body work done after you do stuff like that, you need it. It's not a luxury, like you got to get massages, deep tissue, and even that painful shit that you don't like. Like do you ever get like a real sports deep tissue massage?

Speaker 4:          01:33:50       I don't know. I don't think I, yeah. This took, was standing on me at one point digging her po like foot into my back and it hurt like hell. Massages are supposed to hurt a little bit. That's how you know you're getting a good one. He's like the, they're digging nd you, we've mad cute. Most of us, maybe not you, but most people just take the worst care of their bodies. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:34:09       I take pretty good care of my body, but not as much as I should because I use it so hard. You know? That's why I had to take a couple of months off of Jujitsu because of this reoccurring back injury that I had. I thought a thing called a rib head that kept popping out. So I kinda stopped lifting weights. I stopped doing Jujitsu. I just concentrated on just kickboxing or two whole months. I did very little weightlifting like once every couple of weeks. So we'll do it when it pops out. Like was fucking brutally painful. Where is it in your chest and your back? It's in the center of my back and it would pop out whenever I'd roll with like really big good guys. Like when I have a crazy sparring session where it's, you know, you know me and some other black belt and it's just a attacking, attacking, attacking, you know, and you're moving so much in, there's so much explosion that you, this little thing in my back was weak and that would be the weak link and it would pop out and I would keep rolling too cause I would, I knew why it was hot.

Speaker 1:          01:34:59       It was okay. It would hurt. I wouldn't be able to move right for another, you know, it would fuck me up but an hour from that

Speaker 2:          01:35:06       I'd be fucked. That's how it works, man. I just, My, my dad came to visit and I just moved all this shit for like a bed frame and I was like carrying the bed frame and you always know you're going to be fucked up. Cause there's this moment where your back's like, hey yeah, that you knew it doesn't really hurt you. It's just like a spring or something pops in your bag, something fucking shit. Then the next day I was in agonizing pain, but I want, what is that window of not well that's right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       For the inflammation sets in the injury sets in and then your body's going to inflame around it to try to protect it and that's going to tighten everything up and emailing, Gosh. Yet. So this fucking back injury just kept happening over and over again. So I said, all right, it happened like three or four times over the course of like three or four months. So I said, obviously I need to take some time off. So I took like two whole months off and then after that two months I just started, uh, like lifting out, lifting heavy again and working out hard again. And my body is just starting to ramp back up, but now is the most important time to get massage and time massage too. And Maxwell put me through a a bunch of different time massage stretches to where he got on top of my body standing on my back, like pulling on my back while he was pulling my wrists and stretch. Everything's popping and stretching it. Ah, but you need to do that man. Amazing Body needs to be fucking you. You body's pliable. It needs to be manipulated and it's malleable.

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       I've been trying to get back into the gym again. There was a time I was running five miles a day, which for me that's like, it's a lot. That's a lot. I was doing five miles a day working out all the time. I can't get hooked on the gym again. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've, I'm thinking about going to a doctor. It's like I want to work out, but like I can only get, you know, two workouts in and I feel really great, but then I just don't go back again. So hard to get that. Did that structure that this is very similar to the problem with writing. It's very similar to the idea of resistance that was offered up in that, uh, Steven Pressfield's book, the war of art. It's the same thing. It's like you're, you've come up with excuses and reasons to sabotage yourself and then not doing it to resist the progress.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Were you exercising before, during a breakup or something? No, it wasn't like a d no, it was, uh, it was, it was, what was your lifestyle at that time? That was when I was doing that ridiculous show for fuel TV, galaxy cabin log cabin and space. That was where we were. Joey Diaz played a, a guy living in a boat that was inside your nose. Is that what your neck now? He was playing, he was fishermen and so he's playing a fisherman inside my dead grandfather. His neck, the fisherman, fisherman that lived inside of the boat. Right. He's like an alien in the way that he tries to attack people as he like lives in the next, if they're dead grandfathers and try, their grandfather comes back and you think it's your grandfather. It was a really absurd, that was the best show ever. I think it's online.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       It's on the website, right? Galaxy cabin. If you Google it, did you have some of the weirdest ideas running through your fucking head? Well, yeah. I mean that's the thing though, man. Like the trick is to let yourself make those weird ideas and it's, it's like really hard to like give yourself permission to really make the weird shit. But sometimes I'll see, I'll see stuff, I'll see videos and stuff that people do. Like a, Tim and Eric are like, some of the people are really out on the fringes of things and it's like, God damn it man. You have to have such balls to make something like that. Right? It's so insane and so weird. And if you try to describe it to someone, they're there. It's not, won't even sound funny and it might not even be funny, but it's still, you brought this bizarre thing out into the universe.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       Well, it's because Tim and Eric can do what they want to do. They either on what does it fuel TV or something like that and now they're on adult swim. Who's watching? You know what I'm saying? I mean how many people were watching, how many people are watching what they're doing, how many people are telling them what to do? There's show is so weird. You got to think that someone is letting them be them. You know what I'm saying? And that's why it's so fucking good. Imagine if they had, if they were working for center it live and they said, listen, I got this idea for a sketch. It's called dance floor Dale. Have you seen dancing? If you haven't seen dance floor deal at leas and gentlemen, please Google Tim and Eric's dance floor. Dale. It's one of the most humbling things I've ever seen on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          01:39:20       It's so good and so weird and so out there and so perfect in its weirdness. Everything. The guy and the girl, it's about a guy and a girl meet on a dance floor and they start crying. And a, both of them are real odd looking and they start fucking, and it becomes crazy and psychedelic with all these colors. And uh, and I remember watching it clapping after it was over alone, alone in my office, just clapping in front of my laptop. Have you seen the two Terrys no. That's something they did for funny or die where they play. Uh, I think we're hiring plays this, but they play like trailer trash or hooked on glass. Uh, and uh, Tim has bay is fucking Eric and it's really vulgar and disgusting, but they give birth to a puppet that's kind of this mystical puppet. It's like 10 minutes and it is the trippiest, darkest most awesome thing.

Speaker 2:          01:40:11       It's, I think it's called the two Terrys. It's so funny, but it's, they're really man there. They just did a movie, you know, what is it that Tim and Eric Million Dollar movie there? I tell you what dance for deal was so good. I'm actually scared to watch their other stuff cause I don't want to be disappointed. It's all good. I mean they definitely go to these weird creepy places like half the time you're like, Whoa, what am I watching? But some of that shit is very just amazing. Brilliant. Especially at like the fake company was the fake company that they use throughout the Cinco. Cinco. Like any of the product from single, the one with, uh, it wasn't a single apple or something like that. Uh, the guy from growing pains, the father who was in it, I can't remember his name. I don't know guy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:55       Anyways, they're the, they're the best man. But you know, you watch David Lynch or like, did you ever get to watch the antichrist? That movie I mentioned, you watch any of these fucking shows, these, these giant productions that get made and whenever I see something that's really vividly weird or like gummo think of fucking Gummo. Whenever I see a movie like that, I always had such respect for the person who made it because they had balls man to like, what does Gummo Gum owes this movie by? What's the guy's name? I, I'll tell you the guy's name right now. He just did an, I believe, hold on. I'll tell you the guy's name. Gummo is by harmony Corrine. Corrine. And he just did a, a little video for Diane word, which you guys are saying that he did this video for them, but harmony Corrine is this insane director who one documentary made that never got released his, he was going around New York and provoking fights with guys much bigger than him to videotape himself getting his ass kicked.

Speaker 2:          01:41:50       Like he's a crazy, crazy, crazy guy. Yeah. Check him out in any way. Gum. I was just this weird fucking movie about these weird like white trash kids living in a neighborhood. It's awesome. But G, G U M M O and it's a documentary. It's not a documentary. It's a movie. It's a movie. It's a move. So it's not real. It's not real. I just wanted to clearly get that weird kid eating some in the bathtub. This kid just sits in the bathtub and his mom like feeds him in the bathtub. Like, that's one of the scenes is fucking creepy man. She's awesome. Well it is cooled and stuff like that can exist. It can exist because you know the normal Hollywood machine is not going to approve something like that cause it's too hard to sell. You have to get someone who has money in a vision in the org can talk someone with money into like, hey, here's my vision.

Speaker 2:          01:42:43       What do you think? Can we do this? Right. You know? Yeah. When that's the thing, when you go into a pitch and you have a really weird idea, all anyone at a network is going to think is like this will never, no one's ever gonna Watch this. Even if in your mind you have this pristine virgin up version of it, it's awesome. Selling really weird stuff is quite difficult, but when it, whenever weird stuff makes it through, a lot of the times it does really good. People love it. That's why adult swim is so popular because there the one of the few guys that actually let the weird shit through and they, they produce just nothing but weird shit. Sometimes I'll turn on my TV and uh, I have a projector and there's a projector. The projector comes down and the, it takes like maybe 30 seconds for the image comes on, so I'll hear the words before I see the image.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       And so it's like, I can't do that. Why I'm part dog. And then I'm like, what the fuck? Oh, it's adult swim once. Fucking weird show after the next. And if my TV just happens to be an adult swim, when I turn it on, it's like play the game of what the fuck show is this? Before I could see the image, I can't tell what channel it is until I see the image. Have they played your episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force aqua teen hunger unit now our special, they changed. They changed the name. What does that man, it's, I got to be on this cartoon, which is my favorite cartoon and one of the funniest shows ever. Like I, it's just such a hilarious show. But yeah, I got to play a, I'm on one of the episodes and I play, I didn't get to read the whole script, but I play a triangle. I am on the episode with Neil Hamburger plays another triangle type alien. Um, and I guess we're inventing these cell phones that are basically in the future are going to destroy mankind, but right now they're just very convenient and everyone kind of knows it. So like, oh yeah, that's fine. They're like, yes, in a hundred years it will devour all matter. But you know, for now they're very, they haven't really fast Internet connection.

Speaker 2:          01:44:50       That's what I recall. It's been a while since I did it. That is by the way, so true. That could still be real. That's what it was in that Kurzwell doc. That's the thing is like these guys in the Kurzwell doc, which is like you, they don't just show raise the transcendent material. Man Kurzweil has this quite optimistic version of reality where nanobots exist in our bloodstream, heal every disease and we live forever. But then they go to these other computer experts and when you watch it, or initially you think they're going to kind of refute this ridiculous idea, but they don't refute the idea. They're just like, well, it is an inevitability that in the future we will invent an artificial intelligence. It's more intelligent than us, but to think that this artificial intelligence is going to be kind to us and not just treat us like bugs or insects will think of the thing is a god.

Speaker 2:          01:45:35       It'll look at us as these like weird little like Mala ski insects, like basically we're like cows and right now we're in the process of building a butcher. That's the idea. We're trying to construct this super powerful butcher. That's what knows everything and knows everything. Yeah, it's really weird. Not only that, the butcher that can create an even better butcher, almost instantaneous, yeah. Can go through 50,000 years of progress within months. You know? That's going to be the really nutty thing about artificial intelligence. It's once it's actually sent in and you can create its own artificial intelligence that's far superior to anything that we've created and I'll do that instantaneous. Yeah, they're literally, we would be able to harness all matter. I mean, thinking about what they're doing with this large hadron collider. Simple little monkeys like you and I, but with autism and much more college education, they, they've created this crazy machine. It's 17 miles in a circle that's spinning these atoms around a cunt hair under the speed of light and slamming them into each other, making the most dense matter known to man. I listen as humans. This is us doing it. Imagine the kind of shit that a, a computer that can think centi and artificial intelligence

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       or are they going to even bother though if when artificial intelligence becomes sentient, maybe they'll just clean up all the stupid shit that we've done. Maybe they won't pro progress any further at all. Maybe logically they'll look at it and go, what is the sense of, you know, maybe that is a biological imperative of human beings that we've created intelligent life, but that may be intelligent life won't be under the same restrictions or programming as we are. And then it'll say, well, why don't we balance this fucking place out first? Well, we don't know. And that's the thing. That's what this thing's about. It's like we really don't know what it's gonna do, but sometimes I think about it and I think, oh, maybe the way the alien comes to earth is not an a spaceship, but maybe the alien is outside of time. And the way an alien comes to the planet is it goes into the minds via thoughts.

Speaker 5:          01:47:41       The denizens of the planet gives them the inspiration to create it. So then they all start creating the alien. The alien comes through the organic beings. And then it's just some weird thing made of metal and wires and some super intelligence that we made. But that's the alien. That's, I think it's in Kurzweil's book. He says, the first contact we have with extra terrestrial intelligence or intelligence outside of humanity will be through the roof. The machine. It will be with a super intelligent, uh, I don't like that word. Will, it could be, yeah. Could be, may have already happened. Very possible. We've already made contact with some, something from somewhere else or that we're in constant contact with it, you know, I mean, human beings, we, you know, we've found tribes in Brazil that are isolated from us and we try to stay as far back as possible.

Speaker 5:          01:48:30       That's the, uh, that's what they do. They try not to interfere, you know, there, you'd find them online. There's photographs of him and his tribe and they're covered in red paint, pointing arrows at a helicopter. It's pretty trippy. Well, I mean, that's the, the stitching stuff, you know, that's such an Cichon Cichon Zachariah, Zachariah Cichon just watch this documentary on Netflix about that shit. And it freaked me out, man. What's it called? Ancient aliens. Maybe it's a series on Netflix. I can't remember the name of it, but it's like, it's a series on the history channel. Yeah, I watch it. But it's, it's, it's, it's very sensationalistic though. But just the drawings, I mean when you look at the cave drawings, yeah, it does look like helmet, not cave drawings and you have to worry, think about, it's the Mesopotamian stuff from Babylon and from Iraq, from Sumir.

Speaker 5:          01:49:18       That's the fascinating shit is really the constellation stuff. The really trippy shit as they have clay tablets from 6,000 years ago that show the solar system shows the son and shows all the planets in their correct order in the correct size and the correct orbit. And it's a, it's a trip because, you know, we didn't, well first of all, there's an image of Pluto. I mean if they add all those planets and one of them was in the place where it should be. If it was Pluto, they didn't know about Pluto until 1930 and this, this is 6,000 fucking years ago. I mean this is way, way before

Speaker 1:          01:49:47       people were getting burned to death for suggesting that the earth was round and that the earth was not the center of the universe, but rather, you know something else. I mean with Galileo and Copernicus and didn't Copernicus when they subject to house arrest for suggesting anything other than the, the, the, the, the church, his idea of what the universe and how it was all structured. This is way, way, way before that. All the Sumerian shit. And for those who don't know what this says, Zechariah [inaudible] guy claimed, he claimed that the, uh, the ancient Sumerian text detailed a race from another planet, this planet called Nibiru that came in an elliptical orbit and it came within Mars and Jupiter and got near Earth every 3000, 600 years. These people called the Annunaki, which the literal translation is those from heaven to earth came, which is like very similar to the Elohim of the Bible, which is those who came down or giants, you know, people thought of them as giants and cause all sorts of different ways of describing them.

Speaker 1:          01:50:48       But there's these, uh, this crazy fucking images that they had in these clay tablets of little monkey people, not just black people. They say a black person wants. And I was like, wow, that's an alien. You know what I mean? No, I don't know what you mean. This is the, they all have beards and they all, they're all look like, like people that probably lived in that era. They don't look like black people. They look like a weird gods. These weird helmets on and shit. They're much bigger than everybody else. And what about the skull compressions that people did where they like tried to stretch their heads out for some reason? Yeah, I mean it's, it's very, it's obviously there's something, something crazy was going on in that era. You know, there was, there was a lot of, they knew a lot of weird shit and they knew it out of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          01:51:31       Like they went from 5,000 years ago. I mean you're literally talking about there was ego you go to like 6,000 years to 10,000 years ago if you follow what most archeologists believe. They were basically cavemen 10,000 years ago. I mean there was no written language. There was no, there was none of this shit. There was no astrology, astronomy. I mean they had all the signs of the Zodiac. They had constellations mapped out. They had. I mean there is an amazing culture that came out of nothing and there's two ways of looking at it. There's the way that they look at it. The Zechariah Cichon and fans, I believe that aliens came down and genetically altered a lower primates, added their DNA to monkeys or some apelike animal and made us, and this is a constant theme throughout, you have fall adjusts lore and people who are really into flying saucers and alien invaders.

Speaker 1:          01:52:27       They all have this genetic engineering theme to it, that that is the missing link in quotes, the difference that separates us from from lower hominids because there's like, there's a, there's that giant fucking leap between us and any of the other monkeys. I mean, there's not, there's no god, it's not nothing close to us. All the other apes or nothing like us. We were so fucking advanced in comparison to all and we were amazed that we can teach a chimp to spell his name for a piece of candy. You know what I'm saying? But you know what, if we came into a village in some champ was sitting there with a cell phone that he made out of a coconut, you'd be like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hold this chimp down. Hold them down and put the, you know, trank I'm tracking. I'm tracking them.

Speaker 1:          01:53:10       Get them in the cage. [inaudible] Kevin the cage. He's making his own cell phone. He made his own cell phone. You know, we would freak the fuck out if we know we had a, a chimp to figured out how to make his own house and built a car, we would arrest that. Chimp, chimp figured out how to build his own cars and he's out there in the forest, you know, with a, he taught all these other chimps to melt down metal and they're hitting it with hammers and flattening it out and building shields. We'd be like, Whoa, what the fuck is going on? Primitive, primitive, primitive human shit. We would never allow in chimpanzees. You have imagined like if chimp started building castles, fuck that. Exactly. But bows and arrows with chimps had bows and arrows and started hunting. Other chimps, we would kill them. We would lock them up.

Speaker 1:          01:53:50       There's no fucking way we would let that go down, but you know this, this idea that that human beings at one point in time were like that, that we were some sort of a lower animal like that and slowly evolved and then rocketed ahead of everybody else. The big question is how did that happen? I think probably would happen. I mean, who the fuck knows? The, the ancient alien theory to me is possible to me. I, the way I look at it, if there are humans and there are monkeys, it's very possible. There's something as far removed from us as we are from ants. You know, if this, if this exists, this, this model of the world, if you just use your imagination and very simple steps and think about what we're, we're going to be, if we don't blow ourselves up a thousand years from now, if we do have this, this human, you know, a technology interface a thousand years from now and we become like super fucking hyper advanced.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       That is just as the distance is just as far to me as us, to some sort of an alien that comes here from another planet and it seems like very possible. It also could be that human beings have existed in this form for far, far, far, far longer than we really true. Then the W W we we care to believe because the, the current like sort of, uh, the way, uh, a straw, a astronomers or, um, uh, excuse me, um, uh, anthropologist when they, when they look at, you know, the, the, the history of this earth, you know, you can only go back a certain amount of years before things are just total guesswork, you know, and for human beings, when you talk about like ancient civilizations, when, when those anthropologists sit down and try to study clay pieces of pottery and shit and you, you start getting into like six and thousand and 7,000 and 8,000, who the fuck is to say there wasn't some incredible

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       shit 20,000 years before that. If we're talking about sue mayor and today we're talking about 6,000 years. Okay. What if 6,000 years before that, there was an amazing civilization that had existed for 50,000 years. So much more knowledge than we have today. But they all got fucked up by asteroids or by shifting of the polar ice cap or supervolcanoes artificial intelligence that's possible. Too long made us, and we're all actually programs. Right. And the artificial intelligence eventually ran out of batteries. Fucking died and rotted. Gotcha. It's the old, it's like in a Mad Max. Beyond Thunderdome. The kids have a record player and they figured out how to spin it and it makes us sound, which they like. Do you remember that? It's like that we're just like, you know, we're, we're grasping at these like ancient, we barely have an understanding of these ancient technologies. I, I, I, you know, I'm obviously much less of a skeptic than you are, but the idea that some like genetic Johnny Appleseed style aliens that are outside of time and space came to this planet fucked a monkey, put some genetics into a monkey in a way that allowed that monkey over the course of a certain amount of time to build a spaceship.

Speaker 5:          01:56:59       In other words, the planet or a time machine or whatever it is, and you're going and doing this all over the universe because for you planets or just some kind of factories to organically grow the super advanced machine that we're all being compelled to build and we don't, many of us don't even realize it. That makes a lot of sense to me. It's a simple way to produce something. It's a, especially if you're something that's not stuck in time the way we are, or if your lifespan is millions and millions of years, then why that sounds like something we would do. Yeah. Does sure. If we leave all the other aliens, say if we came to a planet, it was filled with only monkeys and, but we could say, let's take one monkey and and our shit to it and just monitor that monkey. Yeah. And then we'll come back after the things created.

Speaker 5:          01:57:41       Whatever the thing is we're working on, you know, when the things created the art of super artificial intelligence, that's when we come back. Or maybe we don't come back at all. It sounds like such stoner hippie talk. But look, if we exist and we study monkeys, you look at all the Jane Goodall Work and all the fucking shit that people have done throughout history by studying chimpanzees and gorillas and people have been doing that shit forever. They'd been studying lower primates for forever. Why would we think that we're the end? Why would we think that something else couldn't exist? It's far more advanced than us, just as advanced as we are to, you know, in comparison to fucking monkey swinging from the trees and in Venezuela we can be just like that. But it is also possible that we are a slow process of evolution that keeps getting jacked by natural disasters.

Speaker 5:          01:58:30       There's a lot of evidence for ancient society or not interest societies or other, but ancient cultures that we don't understand. There's a thing called the, uh, anti [inaudible] mechanism. I don't know if I'm spelling it, I'm not saying it right, but this is the way you spell it. It's a n, t. I. K. Y. T. H. E. R. A. It's an to Kethora mechanism and it's something that was found in 1901 and it dates back to a 150, 200 BC. So this is before Christ supposedly. And it is this incredible machine with a degree of mechanical sophistication is comparable to a 19th century Swiss clock. And they don't know what the fuck this thing was. And first they thought that it was a, they speculated that it was a designed to, uh, maybe look at, first of all, they thought it was a hoax. And then when they realized it was real, they said, well, maybe they're, they're charting the stars with this fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          01:59:28       They really don't have any idea, but no one believed that anyone from this date was capable of something of this sophistication. Like as far as like what we understand about inventions when you're going 2000 plus fucking years ago, people couldn't make shit like this, but apparently they could. There's a lot of evidence, man. There's a lot of weird evidence that trickles down. You know, it shows like that. There were probably some ancient cultures that were like, all right, way ahead of where we thought there. I believe that the most out of everything, yeah, that seems to be more likely than the alien thing or that we, where are we crashed here like a friend, like we were from Mars. There's a lot of people on the ship and people that believe that that Earth was, uh, only a inhabited with lower animals and lower primates and that Mars was the more sophisticated planet.

Speaker 5:          02:00:21       And then, you know, Mars there, they're absolutely convinced. Now Mars had life and Mars had water, a lot of water flowing water and that something happened to Mars and Mars lost its atmosphere. Whether it got hit by a media, which is very possible. And you know, that's where all these fucking people like Richard Hoagland tweak out about all these weird shapes on the surface of Mars and try to say, yeah, we'll do no faces. They tried to say that this is a pyramid and this is a, you know, this is a dye condor. He drew structure and you know, Tetra Hydro and they try to like make all these weird connections between one rock to another rock and they use mathematics and say, this is very similar within one degree of the, you know, the math, the way the layout of the great sphinxes and the Pyramids of Giza. You know, so who the fuck knows?

Speaker 5:          02:01:03       But you know, the thing is it's like, look at the alternative thing to believe in. You've got the idea that aliens came inseminated the planet. We're descendants of something from another planet or the more popular theory, a bolt of lightning hit a plasmatic. See what the fuck is that? Now that sounds crazier than both of those theories. But wait a minute. It's not, because what you're saying that the aliens always existed and then that they didn't, no one made them out of a bolt. Enlightening. I mean where the fuck did it all comes down at Wyatt Bolt. The lightening got thrown in. That's why not look, it's a, it's a can of something happened. Oh it's like a fucking lick up a storm. A storm caused some shit. You know that electricity somehow or interacted with amino acids and created some little fucking Amoeba. I'll tell you this, if I pause and choose between hanging out with Penn and teller are you, I'll take you any day of the week, man.

Speaker 5:          02:01:56       Penn's a great guy. You'd like hanging out with them and the whole fucking like I'm sure Penn and teller. I'm sure Penn is great, but I'm saying like that version, that current religion, that current idea of things is so dry and boring to me. What do you, when you're saying that current, like what do you exactly do you mean? I'm saying like the skip dice, cynical rationalist view of how life came into onto this planet c is, so if nothing else, super boring, it's the most boring a bolt of lightning hit, uh, hit some carbon and cause it to, is it Darrell man? To me, that Shit's not boring at all. That's so fascinating. The idea that that can happen and that it is an inevitable process that happens just with nature. If that's what we're creates it, if it's, you know, amino acids or water or whatever, it gets in contact with some force.

Speaker 5:          02:02:45       I mean that's amazing to me that I don't think there's anything dry or dull about that fact that that eventually becomes consciousness to me is just, it's just higher order life from single cell to multicell to this thing that we are now, which is some sort of an adolescent stage of evolution between, you know, a conscious, a universal being and monkey fuck monkey like Arnold a uh, fuck monkey. You know, Arnold is like, he's like the epitome of the, the, the, the transition. No Man wants to be the governor and he's still a fuck monkey. Just shoot loads and has made, what if he, what if he just Jerome about him every night now. It never stopped. I haven't as giant. I go back to fleet. Joe, remember him? His balls. I remember like this guy is just taking his underwear off in front of everybody.

Speaker 5:          02:03:34       How fucking crazy it was. It was one of the strangest dreams I've ever had in my life, but it was so vivid and it's because of these nootropics. I'm taking a guarantee. You Chrissa Marcus who's doing them with me. He told me one of the weird side effects of these things. You have crazy as well. We're going to get him. It'll be where we are. We're filling out the, we're finishing our paperwork and everything where the testimonies, I want to get tested. I'll get you some, I'll get you some right after the podcast. We'll, we'll call him and we'll have them shipped over. But um, all right, so that's the end of the podcast. Listen folks, we were sorry we took the two weeks off, but we enjoyed the fuck out of coming back and we're very, very happy that we stayed in the top 10 of iTunes the entire time we were off, which is amazing.

Speaker 5:          02:04:13       I, I'm honored that you guys are a downloading it and telling your friends and all that good shit. We got a lot of cool shit coming up. We've got a lot of things in the works. Click gas. Yeah. Cliffy be tried to reschedule to another. He wanted to move to Friday. I can't do Friday. I want to be in Vancouver. I think that's going to be Tuesdays me a special edition at like 10:00 AM what we're going to do. Either way. We've got a lot of other stuff coming on too and we uh, we, I can't tell you about some things, but we'll be back next week.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       Um, I'm not sure with WHO, but most likely next week it'll be Monday and Tuesday and I'm getting together with Kevin Smith next week two and we're going to blaze and do a podcast at his place. Just me and him. So I'm looking forward to that. That's going to be fun as fuck. And I'll let you guys know about all that shit. Sounds comedy. Hold tonight. We've got a show tonight at [inaudible] hall. If you're in La, come on down because it's a, what is it, like 15 bucks or something like that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:02       Like that. Yeah. Links on your Twitter, my Twitter south, the whole.com.

Speaker 1:          02:05:06       Yeah. And there's a lot of people that are going to be on who's on the show tonight.

Speaker 2:          02:05:10       Ah, we got our magical uh, Tony Hinchcliffe. Uh, Jason [inaudible]. Um, his girlfriend, Danielle and uh, I think I'm forgetting somebody, but yeah, it's going to be good show. Yeah, those are very funny comedy. What are you doing? You wrong? Nah, I can't do it tonight. Fuck Bro. He's allergic to hanging out with us. I'm not allergic and using us for the podcast. That's cool man. Yeah, that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       Um, so the other dates that we have coming up July 1st is the big one at Mandalay bay. That's a Joe Diaz, me and Ari, and I think Doug Benson is going to do a guest spot too. And uh, tickets just went on sale for that. If you go to Joe rogan.net, you can find the links and all that shit. It's all up there, right? So it's a, that's at the Mandalay Bay theater. Um, and also, uh, Pittsburgh on June 25th, there's a UFC down there on the 26th. So I'm doing the Carnegie Music Hall on the 25th. And that's what Joey Diaz as well. And that's a June 25th in Pittsburgh. So tonight, if you're around, if you're in Hollywood, come on down. It's 15 bucks. It's fun. It's a cool little intimate room. And we've got a lot of funny people and we're going to have a good time. So that Sal's comedy hall, and we do that intermittently whenever I'm in town. So that's like a, it's a good spot to come and hang out and just support live comedy and, and we fuck around and come up with some new shit. Um, thanks to the flashlight. If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link on the right hand side for the fleshlight and enter in the code name Rogan. They give you 15% off. Remember on sex toy from apple?

Speaker 1:          02:06:44       Alright, that's it. Love you guys. Thank you very much for tuning in. We appreciate the fuck out of here.

Speaker 1:          02:07:11       Hm.
