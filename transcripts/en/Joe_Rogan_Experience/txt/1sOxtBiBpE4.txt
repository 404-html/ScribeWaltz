Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Oh, you creeps that are controlling money all throughout the world. Your time is slowly closing in. Am I right? You Hip Andrea's Antonopoulos author a published author of the Internet of money. Uh, you've been on the show many times before, but you've never been on the show two days after a book, fresh off the presses. Tell a story about how this book got delivered to you today because it's kind of hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:00:35       Yeah. So nobody knew about this. This is my announcement. This is my second book. First book was mastering Bitcoin was for techies. Uh, the internet of money is for everybody else and it's a collection of my talks and I was having the first copy delivered to my hotel this morning in order to bring it to the show and give it to you. And uh, it was a day late. It was supposed to be delivered yesterday and I'm waiting and I'm refreshing the tracking number site. And then you said, you know, we can push it back by half hour because you're running a bit late. And, and in that half hour, the book God delivered, it literally was printed September fifth. This is the first copy I've touched. And this yours.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       Oh boy, I've got it. Folks. Issues Zero, zero, zero one. Now why did they do that? Just one. Why don't they just make it one? Why does everybody have to do a one?

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       Well, I'm not printing 10,000 issues so.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       Well, they never go. It's never like zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero. Zero one. Did they ever do that pair of shoes once? Recently with that? It was like one out of. Why are you in one of my ears? Only. What the Hell's going on there? That bond. I can't have you in my left here. It's like you're like the voice of good or the voice of bad. Oh yeah. Yeah. I got it too. Yeah, that's too weird. We can't have that. Try it again. Check. Check. Nope. You fucking Weirdo. You're coming in my left ear. Only. Probably the. The rest of America too, right? Yeah. They can't have that. People are at the gym going, what the fuck? Jamie's in my left ear. So this is a collection of all your talks, what has changed in the world of bitcoins. And so last time we spoke we spoke and we hung out in Vegas, which was great. I had a great time with you and um, but what, what has changed in the world of bitcoin since the last time?

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Well, it's been a bout a year and a half almost, and so much so much happening in the meantime that we had a pretty slow 2015 and 2016 picked up again 2015 still coming off a slow and gradual drop in the price. People were very reluctant and skeptical. The media was constantly bashing bitcoin. And then, um, at the same time we saw this really interesting phenomenon where the banks started getting interested in this thing, but

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       not bitcoin itself. No, the blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, which is rather amusing. I, I look at that a bit as if, you know, the Horse Buggy Association of America is going, oh, we like this automobile thing you've designed, but we have a very big investment in Hay and horses and stables and veterinarian. So we're going to use the technology behind the automobile pneumatic tire and we're going to revolutionize horse buggies.

Speaker 1:          00:03:28       But in all fairness, I think what you're saying, it's hilarious, but in all fairness, it is a weird thing to invest in, like to go all in on bitcoin. I mean, I know you do it, but you also make all of your money this way and this is, you know, you're. You're a proselytizing person when it comes to Bitcoin, right? For good reason. But for the average person saves, saved up actual cash money their whole life and is involved in this established system of money to throw all their money into bitcoin would be insane. You watched the money fluctuate, it goes up and it goes down. Well, I'm thinking, I'm glad you said that, that it would be insane. That would be a terrible idea. Right? But don't you think that that's probably why the media bashes it and why banks are just looking at it going like people see that there's a growing number of people that are using it for transactions.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       There's Bitcoin ATM now and people are using it to to purchase things. There's several companies that accept bitcoin for for products, for actual real physical products, but yeah, but I mean it's not an investment so it shouldn't be treated as an investment. I mean not don't even mean like as an investment. I mean as like a primary source array of money, of, of, of if you decided to take all of your money, not as an investment, but just say, I'm going going to live off a Bitcoin, I'm going to spend bitcoin. Much like your money's going to go up and down.

Speaker 3:          00:04:52       Yeah. What are you going to be really hard, especially if you're. If you're accustomed to privileged banking, like if you have the kind of banking that we have in this country, if you actually have access to that and you have a a nice visa debit card and you don't pay account fees and your money doesn't get confiscated by a dictator too often and you know you can earn your money and interact with other people, then why? Why would you use bitcoin? The simple answer is that's not really the use case, but there are lots of people around the world who simply don't have access to that and for them, you know, in many cases bitcoin is the stable currency, you know, ask a, an Argentinian, Venezuelan, Brazilian Supriya to Greek and the list goes on and on and on. Whether they're worried about volatility in bitcoin and in many cases if they've heard of it, if they've used it, that's the stable currency.

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       They're national currency is far, far worse. Right. Did you say Brazil? Yeah. Brazil has had a massive devaluation the last year. How much devaluation, because I know that they have experienced some sort of a really radical economic downturn, which is really interesting because a few years ago when we first started going into Brazil, their economy was booming. W W we. I'm saying the UFC, yeah, they're at a currency crisis right now. Massive currency crisis. What's going on? Well, apart from the political crisis that's going on, and I won't speak for that because I'm not the Brazilian, but you know, they've had impeachment proceedings. They just impeached their president. There's been a lot of economic difficulty with the country and I think they, their currency has devalued almost 30 percent in the last year of 20 or 30 percent. Some staggering amount in currencies don't move like that. Mainstream national currencies that have very large economies behind them simply don't move like that.

Speaker 3:          00:06:42       We've seen it happened only a couple of times. We've seen it happening in Greece and Cyprus during the economic crisis. We saw it happen in Britain, uh, during brexit. And we've seen it in places like Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and places like that. How much currency did, how much of a percentage of Britain you lose during brexit? Almost 20 percent in a day. And three things responded to. That's in the opposite direction. Gold, the Japanese yen and bitcoin heading in the exact opposite direction. A bitcoin climb, 20 percent that they almost really. So did Britain rebound. Um, it did a bit, but it's still in historic, close, multi-decade lows. So they took a really big hit. And what we've seen again and again is at times of crisis, um, we see this pattern repeating where people use bitcoin as a safe haven investment to get money out of a national currencies, especially where there are very strict currency capital controls.

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       So one of the reasons we've seen a bitcoin, probably one of the reasons we've seen a lot of activity with bitcoin in China is because of currency controls. Every time the yuan, the Chinese currency devalues against the dollar and it's done. So I think four times in the last year, every time there was a massive uptick in bitcoin buying in China. So people are parking their money in bitcoin or using it to convert it to other currencies and get money out of the country. So what is the biggest fluctuation that bitcoin has had? Um, well, it, it depends whether you look at it on a monetary basis or on a percentage basis. If you look at the movements now, it can go up 30, 40, even a hundred bucks in a day. Um, which seems like a lot, but as a percentage, the biggest fluctuations that had were in 2010 and 2011, uh, when it rose from under a dollar to over $30 and then back down to under a dollar in a period of a couple of months.

Speaker 3:          00:08:48       For people who don't understand what this means when you're, when you're saying it a hundred bucks or a dollar $30. Like what is that in relationship to one bitcoin, one bitcoin equals $30 or in 2011. And what does it equal right now? Six hundred and 17. Six hundred $17. Jesus, it was about $230 at the beginning of this year. So I've seen a massive ramp pop and a renewal of interest that. Okay, so massive ramp up. But like what's the fluctuation? So if it's at 616, is that what you said? Yeah, it's tripled since the beginning of the year almost. Is it possible that it could drop to like 200 tomorrow? Yes. See that scares the shit out of people. Yes. And, and which is why, you know, here's, here's the, here's the truth, over the seven years that it's existed, the volatility as a percentage has been going down every single here.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       So as the economy gets bigger, the bigger it is, the more stable it is. A doesn't get buffeted around, right? It's just like a very large boats doesn't get pushed around by the waves. And bitcoin is like a Zodiac next to theU , s dollars, titanic and the Little Zodiac is bouncing up and down on the waves a lot. And it might be uncomfortable at times. Of course, if you're heading to an iceberg, you want to be in the thing that can actually turn on a dime. That's a good way to look at. But, uh, I don't know if it's a fair analogy, but it's a good way to look at. Yes, it's volatile. And that's part of, it's part of the fact that a 10 to $12,000,000,000 economy stretched across the entire globe is a small economy, is a currency. Now in the interest of making this a standalone podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:10:29       So people are not going to go back and listen to all the other podcasts that we've done. Explain very briefly if you could, what is bitcoin and how does it work? I'm glad I have this opportunity to do it again because every time we have a new audience. So bitcoin is internet money. It's a system of money that exists on the Internet, was created on the Internet and it allows you to send and receive value the same way you can send to receive an email anywhere in the world instantaneously without intermediaries. And, and that's kind of what you see at first glance behind that. It's a whole platform. It is as the title of the books as the Internet of money. It is, it is a set of protocols that allow you to basically exchange value with other people. But you can do a lot more with it than just that.

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       Most people will use it as a currency. It's basically money that you can transmit from your smartphone to somebody else's smartphone directly, just like cash. Um, but electronic. And the thing about it that's unique is that it's not owned by any corporation, any bank or any government, just like the web isn't owned by anyone or email isn't owned by anyone. And there's lots of companies that can send or receive email. There's also companies that can set up websites. There's a lot of companies that can set up applications that use bitcoin. And I should say that when you set it up for me, the first time you did it, a bunch of people donated bitcoin. So what I did was I'd said whatever people donated, I would match or I would double it, and then we would donate it to fight for the forgotten have build wells in the Congo.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       And we built. I don't remember how many Justin Wren said, but it was A. I don't even remember how much money, but it was many thousands of dollars. People donated. And then I doubled it and then we sent it over to the Congo. So the bitcoin community is very generous, is my point that that is true. And part of that generosity comes from the fact that a lot of the people in this community are very excited about this technology and want to share it with others. They want to tell other people about this technology. It's really quite interesting what happens when you create a form of money that is truly global. We really don't have forms of money that are truly global. If you even even with your very advanced banking system and your access to all of the technology that you have in the American banking system.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       If you try to send money to some countries, it's almost impossible to do. And I experienced this every time I get paid in Bitcoin, I'll go into a conference in Europe, um, and I'll do one conference with the banking industry and one conference with the bitcoin community and the little bitcoin conference. It's going to be free to attend and I don't make any money, but they sometimes cover some of my expenses and I'll send them an invoice. And the banking industry conference will send me a wire transfer. It takes on average four weeks for me to get it with several calls to find out where it went, what's going on, why did it get lost? And it takes me on average 15 minutes to get paid in Bitcoin, no matter which country and being paid it is. This is the cynic in me is this because when they take the money and they're transferring it, they're moving it around and now it's sitting in banks.

Speaker 3:          00:13:50       When banks have money, if they have your money, even if it's just for a few weeks, they have the opportunity to use that money to make more money. Are they doing that? Um, it, it certainly doesn't. It doesn't hurt to keep it a bit longer. They're doing it primarily because, um, because the system has a series of intermediaries and each of those intermediaries represent a risk. If one of those intermediary says, I have the money for Mr Antonopoulos wire and you give that money to Antonopoulos, but the intermediary doesn't give it to you, you're out of money. Right? So there's those risks with every intermediate you put in, there's risk. And that's called counterparty risk. The because of the way the banking system is with perhaps five, six, seven intermediaries in a single transfer, uh, that creates a lot of cumulative risk and they protect with at risk by slowing things down and um, that risk doesn't exist in bitcoin because it's from one party directly to another, no counter parties. That's one of the core principles.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       And the funny thing, I had this conversation with my bank instead said I had done this, um, conference in Germany, Frankfurt at the headquarters of the Bundesbank. Now, for those of your viewers or listeners who don't know, the Bundesbank is the Federal Bank of Germany and they probably consider the United States Federal Reserve to be a mediocre creditor compared to the Bundesbank. This is like the best credit rating on the planet. Right? And I'm going to speak at a conference there and they're paying me for my expenses and they send a wire transfer and I call my bank and after four weeks they finally find it and tell me we've received your bank, your bank wire transfer. We're going to hold it. Um, because of the risk profile. Like I don't understand, well, you haven't been paid by this particular payer before, so we're going to put a hold on it said you do know this is the Bundesbank you are holding and they held it for two weeks. You are holding for two weeks because of the credit risk of the Federal Bank of Germany, the most credit worthy institution. I'm not trying to receive money from Somalia, you know, this isn't even something weird. And if, if even they campaign me in the age of the Internet instantaneously, there is something wrong with this banking system. And there is because I got paid for the bitcoin conference was doing in the same town instantaneously.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       But there's also concern on their end about fraud, right? I mean, isn't it, but there's fraud with bitcoin as well. I mean, wasn't there, um, that issue with those guys that were investigating the dark web, it turned out that the agents were stealing bitcoin to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wasn't that the case with.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       Yes, absolutely. So the difference, the difference is a difference between systemic fraud and individual cases of fraud. Um, so I'm in Bitcoin as in the traditional banking system. If, if a bank or an organization concentrates a lot of money, then you can go in and steal it. You basically robbed the Big Coin Bank just like people rob the normal bank. And how would they do that? Just hack into it. So they hack in and they do it. And this has happened many, many times. And this is a problem with bitcoin banks as opposed to person to person exchanges. Correct? Because the whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't need to put your money in the custody of someone else and if instead you use bitcoin as it is intended, where everybody keeps control of their own money, then in order to hack all of those people either have to hack the bitcoin protocol itself has not happened in seven years. And the way it's structured is impossible. Do or you

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       have to hack each individual account holder and you can hack individual account holders depending on their level of security and sophistication. But, um, you know, to get very large amounts you have to wait for them to give their money to someone else. What was that exchange? The bitcoin bank that started off as like a fantasy website and some, what was that again? Uh, this was a Mt. Gox in Japan. The magic, the gathering online, which they see in the early days of bitcoin. There wouldn't know exchanges. So you've got to think back like, do you remember on the web, uh, in the early days when even the largest, most sophisticated corporations had a page with a single logon, a gray background, and some flashing lights that said under construction, like in 1994, that's where we are in bitcoin's still. So there's, there were no, um, well run exchanges at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       It was very difficult to buy and sell bitcoin. And so this guy in Japan had a site that could trade these magic, the gathering online cards and um, he converted the site to trade currencies instead to create trade cryptocurrencies. It turns out it's a lot easier to hack in and steal cryptocurrencies than it is to steal the cards. Whatever happened with that, because the story was like hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoins, just hundreds of millions of dollars. Millions. They didn't vanish that event or someone stole it. They got stolen. Uh, they got cycled through the economy and they're back in the economy now, but just not with the same owners. No one knows who. No one knows who. That seems bizarre. Like if you rob a bank, like they can put a trace on the bills and they can figure it out eventually in most people get caught, right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       Yeah. Not really. I mean, no, no. If you, if you do wire fraud perhaps, but in many cases with cash, bitcoin is ly cash. Uh, it is equally untraceable. It's very difficult to actually catch like, I think recently, um, I was reading about the FBI closing the, a db cooper case is the Guy who robbed the bank, got into seven, one seven aircraft, opened the rear staircase and jumped out to the parachutes over the midwest was never seen again. Um, you know, they think that guy died though. Hm. Well that, that, that would be a convenient to explanation for the failure of the FBI to catch him. Yeah, it would be convenient, but also didn't even like drop into the woods. Uh, I, I don't know the details. They never found him body or money ever again. But that can happen pretty easy. I would be more likely or more, uh, apt to believe that if someone dropped into the woods, out of a parachute with some fucking haphazard gear and left out of the back of a plane, they probably died.

Speaker 3:          00:20:46       Probably got eaten by bears or something. Yes. Or, or found by a local woodsmen and the cabin who's like some, some dude fell out of the sky with a Satchel full of money from my money. I need a new chainsaw. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but when you're stealing money from a bank, can't they trace the serial numbers? Like if you steal cash, like if you go, you know, this is a robbery, stick them up and he pointed gun at the tower and they fill up the bag with currency and you run out the door. Don't they have like a trace on that money like where they can if you spend the cash? No, no, not really. And they can't because they have all kinds of. I mean, yes, if they had a batch of sequentially numbered clean money, yeah, but that's not how most banks work.

Speaker 3:          00:21:34       What the money they have on hand is the stuff that came to positive did in the last week by various people, cash businesses like Delis and grocery stores and things like that, and they have no idea what the numbers on those bills are and they don't trace it. It's simply considered part of the risk of business. And what does this avoid? Deb Cooper's money before. Oh Shit. Some of them get this out of the left side of my ear. It's bad cable after reset. Okay. No sign of DB. Cooper ever emerged. Investigators doubt he survived and never been able to determine his true identity, but a boy digging on the Columbia River beach in 1980 found three bundles of weathered $20 bills. Cooper's cash according to the serial numbers. That guy's dead as fuck. They found his money. Some of his money. Was he like left of because being sneaky, I'm going to pretend I'm done.

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       I'm just leave some of those fears. No, they. They only found like a very. I don't think they recovered more than a tiny fraction of it. Oh yeah, but I don't know. I mean I remember the details always stealing like 200 grand though. I think it was only like $200,000 or something. In those days you could pay the national debt with that kind of money. What year was it? Like sixties, 71. There's a lot of money in those days. That DB Cooper store is an interesting story. It's A. People love a story like that when people don't get caught. Yeah. The mystery of the unknown. All the Mt. Gox thing. Exchange is kind of a mystery to. It's a $100, million dollar. Many hundreds of millions of dollar mystery inside story of Mt. Gox bitcoins. Four hundred $60. Billion dollar disaster for 60. Look at that guy. They're leading them around. That's Martin who is a. Yes, it was the guy who is now out on parole. I believe four on or pending trial. So that guy's out $460, million dollars and he's out. Yeah, of course. Well, is he responsible? Just because he's retarded, you know that. That's one of the things we don't know and maybe we'll never know how much of that responsibility, whether it was deliberate, whether it was an inside job, whether it was a in something in competence. Well, he was certainly. That was an enormous amounts of incompetent. That's clear.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       And when you listened to him talk, I've heard him in speeches when he's discussing the issue of you're like, wait a minute, that guy

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       I. Yes, exactly. What have you heard Bernie madoff talk? Yes. True. Yeah, right. I mean, the thing is the, even, even the most. And the interesting thing is that just up to the day before Bernie madoff was indicted, indicted, he was the top trusted name on Wall Street. He had the most stellar credit rating. He was the head of the credit rating agency for, uh, those types of funds that he was rated under. Um, and the next day he's a CROC. So you can see these things happen throughout human history, the changing the form of money you used doesn't change that, but if he changed the architecture of money and you make it less necessary, uh, and I'm less useful to concentrate the money in the hands of third parties that has an impact. And so that

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       it's one of the issues with this. Something like Mt Gox or with any banking system.

Speaker 3:          00:24:48       Yes. Other than the bitcoin system. W, yes. I mean, the problem is the counterparty risk. If you give your money to other people, the entire reason we have oversight in banking is because of the simple truth that if you give your money to other people, eventually they'll try to steal it. That's it. And the only reason they, they don't get someone in the bank is going to have a tremendous need. The tremendous gambling problem and addiction something, right? Or just have a lack of empathy in and social socialization and just be, you know, correct. Crooked, but they don't even have to be crooked. They can make a mistake and trading and tried to cover it up with customer money. They can have a, uh, debts there, their parent may require an expensive surgery that they can't afford. There's lots of reasons why people commit financial fraud and not all of it is because they're just greedy, evil assholes. But, but the bottom line is that all of the oversight system we have in banking, which by the way fails again and again and again and again to protect and regular people from these thefts. All of these systems we have exists for that one reason. So the answer is not build better systems to watch the people who hold your money. The answer that bitcoin gives us, don't let others hold your money, hold your own money and then you don't have this problem. There was recent

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       investigative report about a firm in Georgia, I want to say it's Atlanta that has a ridiculously high rate of success with investments and they interviewed the Guy who runs it and you know his reasons for why they're so wildly successful and they make so much more money than anybody else. We're very suspect and they're closing in on this guy like, what's going on over here? And they think that not only is the Bernie model, not just Bernie Madoff, but they, they think that it's common and that there's a lot of people that might be supplementing legitimate investments with a pyramid scheme and that it's been a standard operational model for a lot of these firms because they've been able to pull it off.

Speaker 2:          00:27:01       What we've seen again and again throughout history in the area of finance, is that when there's a recession, when there is a drop in income and profitability for everyone, uh, that event is actually really good for capitalism. What it does is it washes out the frauds. It washes out the failures, it washes out the unprofitable businesses. It's a great cleansing event, right? Because the tide recedes and suddenly you see who's not wearing swimming trunks. So we knew there was something fishy going on the water, but it's a good way of looking at it. When that happens in, in Wall Street's all of those companies that were simply reinvesting the recent gains to pay the people who are withdrawing their money or the retirees that are supporting in their pension funds, et Cetera, suddenly they don't. They can't do that anymore. They're washed out of the business.

Speaker 2:          00:27:59       A badly performing businesses on profitable. As all of these things get washed out. We haven't been doing this in this country for the last three decades. Instead what happens is every time there's a recession, the Fed steps in a or the government steps in and basically they pump water to raise the tide again. Right? As much as possible, and that means that a lot of the crux float from recession to recession without getting revealed worse, it encourages that kind of behavior. And so you get all of these businesses whose only ability to make profits is when the interest rates to zero and this $20 million dollars a month being injected by the Fed and their business model is take that and lend it to consumers for 29 99 Apr Right? Or do payday loans or subprime loans or subprime auto, student loans, mortgages, etc. Etc.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       You nEed a cleansing events to wash out the fraud. Um, I, I liked the example of a forest fire. If you suppress all of the small fires will happens, is eventually you build up a lot of undergrowth in the forest. A small fire doesn't kill the trees. It just cleans out the undergrowth. You keep putting out the fires, which we've seen since the seventies here in the states. You let all of the undergrowth grow up. Then when a fire comes through, it's not just a little forest fire, it's a raging inferno. Now. You can't put it out and it burns the trees and destroys the soil. Sterilizes the top foot of soil. We've seen this happen, right? And so this is now happening in terms of our economy, which is that all of this, um, bible creation doesn't get washed out in a recession. More stimulus, more funding.

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       The federal reserve pumping more money into the economy. Trillions of dollars since 2008. And all of this stimulus, where does it go? It goes into inflating not one bubble. We had real estates, but now we have real estate and subprime auto and student loans and and and and bonds and stocks and currencies all inflating at the same time. Is it possible to do a controlled burn for the economy? Like that's what they're doing in some places where they want to deal with the issue that you're talking about how there's stop forest fires. That's theoretically part of the mandate of the federal reserve, which most people don't realize is a private corporation owned by the banks and not a government agency. Yeah, that's a tricky name. Yeah. Yes. Federal reserve. That has nothing to do with that. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of gross. Yeah. In fact, I can't name say my pUblishing company for the book, the, the, the federal publIsher.

Speaker 2:          00:30:52       They won't allow me to put the word federal in the name of my company as they shouldn't. Right. But in order to create an organization like that, you need an act of congress. In fact, actually what you need as an act of congress passed in the middle of the night on a recess, which is exactly how they passed the federal reserve act in 1913. It was a long ass time ago. It's so ridiculous. They keep that name, but there is federal ammunition. I should just say that you could buy bullets. Company called federal ammunition, has nothing to do with the federal government interest is to good good company to buy bullets from. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       just seems like the. The controlled burn idea. How would you apply that to the economy? I mean, if what we're talking about, raise the interest rates. You raised them. Yep. It was. Drains the drains. The swamp. Raised the interest rates. Basically the interest rate controls the cost of money. If you make money more expensive than those who borrow have to have a pretty good rate of investment return on their investment to invest that. Right. Otherwise they don't borrow money. That's an extremely unpopular idea though, right? So how do you get that across? Well, it's an. It's an unpopular idea because it benefits savers instead of debtors. Right? So if you, if you have savings, it's a great idea. I remember a time when I could get a certificate of deposit for my savings in the bank and I could get three percent a year, three percent a year, right? I can't get point three percent now. So savers get wIped out. If you're a retiree who's got all of their money in savings right now, the return you're getting on those savings isn't enough to cover your cost of living. So your money basically is shrinking and that's a tax on savers that benefits

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       debtors, especially very large debtors like the federal government. Yeah. It's such a complicated system that for the average person is working all day and you know, you get home, you have hobbies and family and things that you want to do. It's very difficult to get a grip on exactly how money works. Yes, it is, and it's one of those,

Speaker 2:          00:33:00       the things I found through my experiences doing these talks that I do, and I talk about that in the book too, that the whole point of this particular book of the internet of money is why bitcoin and I talk about the philosophy behind money, the, the topics of money that most people don't understand. And what's really astonishing is that here I am and I'm talking about the greatest experiment in money. Um, started in 2008, 2009. And this great experiment is completely unprecedented in the history of money. And I'm not talking about bitcoin. I'm talking about 22 central banks simultaneously taking their interest rate to zero and pumping the largest amounts of money ever created into the world economy, trying to stop it from collapsing. And that has created the largest bubble in history. and the weird thing is that most people are not even aware that they're living in a time where we're doing this completely unprecedented, untested. No one knows where it goes. Huge monetary experiments in which 2 billion people are hostage as part of it, at least, right, and nobody knows where this is going to go, but most economists, mainstream economists say, this doesn't end well. What does that mean though? And then we have the other lifts, monetary experiments, which is, hey, money on the internet with a controlled issuance, only a certain amount of the money is created. It's controlled by a mathematical formula. You can't make more and as a result it's got a stable

Speaker 1:          00:34:36       ply. It sound money and it cannot be manipulated by governments or banks will. It's so confusing for anyone as it is when you get into the issue of what is money and where's money coming from and how does the federal reserve, how does the government, how does anybody create more money? How do you print more money and if you are printing more money, where's it coming from and what is it? Debt. Right? But what is it like? What is it used to be gold. It used to be the gold standard. It used to be if you had a dollar, a dollar's worth of gold, it was a note that was worth a dollar's worth of gold. Yes. That made sense. And that stopped

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       first stopped in 1936, I believe, bretton woods agreement. And then it stopped completely in 1971. when nixon closed the gold window, he basically said, if anyone comes to your bank and gives you one silver dollar, a one gold dollar and says, I want my silver, you say no, and basically defaulted on the backing of us dollars. Buy gold.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       I met this wacky guy

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       a long time ago that was, um, he was coming around the comedy store's this really odd guy for a bunch of reasons. Um, but one of the things is he cArried a gun everywhere he went and he believed in. He believed in precious gold coins that were minted outside of the federal government and using those as currency. Yes. And so he would have these coins that he carried with him, everything. And we try to pay for things in these coins, like gold and silver coins, mostly silver. It's silver coins. And he was trying to explain to me that this is legal and that, you know, they're supposed to accept these. And it was a very weird stuff. It was a very, very odd. He was very annoying too because one of the guys, they like talk to you. He kept touching you would talk to you and like hold you.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       And like, like grab your arm and hold you and touch you. And all right fucker. What are you here here? A control freak. A weird control freak. You know, if someone's saying something to you and they are holding onto you while they're saying that to you, unless you're in love with them, you know, like you creates a very strange moment. Why are you holdIng me? Can I get loose here? What if I have to run away real quick? Do you have to break this grip? But this guy used to carry these coins around with them. I can't fucking sack. He likes to touch his money. Elvis off commercials and shit like that. No man, they were like some weird fucking coin with like an american eagle on them. Yeah. This. Yeah. They're not weird, they're minted in the u. S full silver coins. Now they're weirdest.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       Fuck their weird if he tried to use them to buy a coffee. Although a lot of people buy these and gold coins and small gold bars as investments, they keep them in a safe. Right? And the idea is if there is a significant crash in the car and seat, then these have holding value, right? And it's not. It's I think, perfectly sane to say if you have some money put aside in savings, don't put it all in stocks. Maybe diversify, put a bit in precious metals, maybe put a bit in digital currencies, maybe put a bit in commodities and other things that's kind of reasonable investing. And here's the thing, a lot of the people who have these kinds of attitudes come from families and from cultures where there has been the time in the past two generations where you leave in the middle of the night with all of your belongings in a pillowcase and with people with guns and dogs after you trying to murder you.

Speaker 2:          00:38:09       And this happens today in Syria, right? Um, it happens one generation to go to my parents' generation in, in Greece with the nazis, and it happens to the russian people. It happens to people all over the world. And when that happens, and it's, it's really close when it happens, is generation before, right? Your parents tell you the stories. It's a, it's a different feeling. It hasn't happened to most americans in at least two or three generations. But when that happens, what do you put in the pillowcase? And I'll tell you something, the pieces of paper are worthless when that happens. And that's why some people do want to have physical coin. Now, one of the things we've noticed now is that digital currencies may start to serve a role. Uh, the, the fact is that you can memorize 12 english words and carry your entire bitcoin wallets in your head. And if you do that well, you 12 english words. What are those words? Celsion party on? Yeah. So, um, you can generate a bitcoin wallet, right? And then make a backup of it. And for convenience, some of the inventors and the space developed a system where you can back up any bitcoin wallet, even if it has millions and billions of transactions and assets in it, you can back it up to between 12 and 24 english words that are generated automatically by the program. So we can

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       be like that speech and pulp fiction where Samuel Jackson pulls a gun on that kid. That could be your password.

Speaker 2:          00:39:46       Yes. You don't pick the words though. Oh, you don't pick the words. You're going to get a series of words and they're going to be a, you know, asparagus, forest, a attorney, whatever. All. I like dick's please. Shit on my head. Yeah. No sentences and no words like that. But think about the power of being able to transport an unlimited amounts of money simply by memorizing 12 words that can't be confiscated from you when you're a refugee.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       It's amazing. the whole, uh, the whole idea behind it is incredibly fascinating to me. And I've been a fan of it since the time I met you. And before that I was reasonably interested in it. But of course having you illuminated and such a great way, it really made it much more, um, much more enticing and much more interesting and I've always been, I'm curious from that point on as to where it's going to go. And, uh, I just don't, I don't know, when I look at the landscape of money and I look at the landscape of people that are willing to make this leap. I don't know what it would take to get people fully onboard with bitcoin, but I believe like you do that the system that we have now, the banking system is incredibly corrupt and just bizarre

Speaker 2:          00:41:06       and fragile and fresh. And I think that's the thing that most people are missing. It looks giant imposing. It's been there for a century that is not a sign of strength.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       You find that the company in atlanta that has this massive return on your investment that's being investigated. I'm not sure if I found the right guy and I don't want to call them. Okay, I'll look. I'll look again, but

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       it's got to be a bunch of those people out there that are doing that, right? Yeah, absolutely. The, there's, there's a lot of um, a system like that which is, which is very opaque, which most people don't understand is the kind of system you want to corrupt because that's where you can make the most money without anybody noticing. And of course, You know, financial crime is not really prosecuted in this country. Um, in 2008 giants crisis, millions of homeowners kicked out of their homes, illegal foreclosures, robo signing, mills, blah, blah, blah, blah. The only person who went to jail, bernie madoff, who stole from the rich, uh, pretty much everybody else, scott free. And that was pretty interesting. It's almost like he was just a scapegoat. Well, he was obviously a crook. He was obviously, he was obviously a crook, but in sociopath or something, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of books in the same scale and giant investment banks that are just as corrupt and we don't see that right.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       You, you can get, you can get pulled over for a busted tail light and thrown in jail in plenty of the states in this country for six months for having an herb in your car. And aT the same time you can put a million people out of their homes through straight up fraud with mountains of evidence and emails and things like that. And they're untouchable. That system, the problem isn't the fact that there's fraud. The problem is that the system itself is fragile because of that. And if it was just them going out of business, when the fragile system has problems, when it has hiccups as it did in 2008, that's fine, but it's not just them going out of business. It's a generation of kids who leave college with nothing waiting for all of them, but a job. Um, and you know, coming into a generation where their parents could get by with one income and a household and now three jobs each in a household of two.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       And you can't afford to buy a car, let alone a house. Right? So we're part of the new sharing economy. And what is the sharing economy? It's the, I can tone anything because I can't afford anything economy, so that whole generation is now suffering because of that fragility of the system and the fragility hasn't gone away, but I don't want to dwell too much on the negative, right? Because they're. The thing that I find positive and interesting about bitcoin is that it serves a global society. It is truly global traNsnational money. There's plenty of places in the world that have it worse than the u. S there's some places that have it better financiallY. Um, but it really is quite an incredible concept to be able to have this money that can operate on a global basis. And with that the opportunities to a buy and sell and trade and invest and borrow internationally. The fact that what we did with the fundraising here to fundraise for those wells, right? We don't know if that was just people in the us donating. It wasn't. I can guarantee you there were people from all over the world donating and that's almost impossible to do with traditional payment systems. You could have sent that money directly to where the wells were being built again anywhere in the world, and that's really exciting to me.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       People are uncomfortable with bitcoin because it represents changing one of the fundamental ancient technologies of civilization money and we've only changed that technology four or five times in the history of human civilization. We've gone from bare bones, barter systems. here's a goat, give me three chickens, right to systems of precious metals and other nice objects, feathers, shells, etc. To excluSively precious metals to a precious metal stamped with the faces of kings, and then at some point around the 15th century, you start seeing certificates of deposit for, for precious metal being exchanged. Paper notes that I have a deposit of gold there. I'm not going to move the gold from my deposit to your deposit. They'll just give you the piece of paper that says you're now the owner and paper money is introduced and then plastic in the 19 fifties, a diner's club, a traveler's checks and the first credit cards, and if you think any of these transitions were smooth, none of them were smooth.

Speaker 2:          00:46:23       You go to someone who's been using precious metals for 10 generations and you say, hey, this piece of paper is money. They're like, give me something shiny that I can bite. That's money that this paper, I don't know who you are. Go away. How long has that transitioned? For? A hundred years, right? Until broad acceptance of paper money for 100 years with huge resistance. It took almost 40 years for credit cards to go mainstream. With bitcoin, we're going to do it probably in less than 20. You think so, but it was almost 10. It's seven. Seven, yeah, and it's accelerating very much. I think in some countries you're going to see either bitcoin or cryptocurrency very similar or based on bitcoin be used as commonly as a national currency. We're not looking to displace national currencies. We're looking to supplement them. I think the idea being that people will get comfortable using multiple currencies just like many places they are.

Speaker 2:          00:47:27       If you're, you know, between the border of Kenya and Tanzania for example, you're probably going to use for different currencies, kenyan money, Tanzania in us dollars and euros easily. Possibly also south african rand, so you've got four or five currencies, you can stop at a four year old in the streets and ask them what the exchange rate is and they'll tell you right, because they trade for their parents and merchant stalls along the border and they have people come in with all kinds of different currencies. It's not that difficult to assume that there's digital currencies in that future, either there or in a major modern metropolis Where people are using bitcoin to transact online to buy things, virtual things, a music video, things like that. What you want to make very, very small payments with credit cards and not suitable and use bitcoin as well as their normal currencies.

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       What is the progress it makes you so optimistic? Like what is the. If you could point to any one thing or several things that make you optimistic about bitcoin's future? Well, I think watching it as, as a computer scientist, as a technologist, I look at this and I see innovation that is accelerating and I see much of the early vision opening up the possibility of doing things that are so far outside. What we could do with traditional money, um, that it, it often blows my mind, for example, I'm a technology that's being introduced into bitcoin now is called payment channels. And what it allows you to do is to do a very high volume of small transactions at a very rapid rate. Let's say your, you want to watch a video and you want to pay the owner of that video to send it to you.

Speaker 2:          00:49:21       Um, how about paying by the second. And so you say you set up basically an account and you pay by every second of video, maybe every fifth of a second, 200 milliseconds of video at a time and you're paying a fraction that is a thousandth of a penny and you keep watching video and paying a thousandth of a penny for every fifth of a second on this drip metered basis. Well, you're not doing it. You're a computer. Software is doing it, communicating with our computer software. And now you can do this really incredible thing. You can pay for content what it's actually worth. Um, whereas the thresholds for a payment on a credit card is two to $3, unless you're apple and you're doing billions, in which case you can take it down to ninety nine cents. That's about the lowest you can go. So meaning watching something on youtube or some similar video streaming device, you would have to pay service rather.

Speaker 2:          00:50:17       You'd have to pay, but you would pay a very minuscule amount. Yes. Like what? Like whAt are you talking about a couple of cents like to watch? No, I'm, I literally mean a of 500th of a cent to watch a video. Well it depends how long the video is, but you could, you could. Yeah. it could be a scale. You could pay a penny. Yeah. You could pay a penny or half a penny or a 10th of a penny to watch a video. But what, how would that work for the people that are providing content like. Well you see the thing is they operate at a scale. I have 30,000 views on one of my videos, right? So youtube pays me 30 bucks for that. If I put ads in front, if I was getting a penny from each of my customers or because these are like hour long videos, maybe I'm going to charge more baby. I'm going to charge twenty five cents. Know 30,000 views. Twenty five cents. Somebody do the math please. Uh, not good at math. Seven grand? No, it's like 70 bucks. $70.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Twenty five cents as a quarter of a dollar. No, it's 7,000. You're right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's a rare time where I'm writing the math fucking quick question like that. So maybe I'm going to charge less maybe, but in any case I can beat what youtube gives me in terms of ad revenue with each customer paying a fraction of a penny. And here's the real question, but I get this content for free right now. Interest. Why would I pay a fraction of a penny? You don't get it for free. You're paying, you're paying in. Yes. In micro violations of your privacy. What's your. If the product costs less than two or $3, making the stank face now if agreeing with you. But that was a weird way to word it. Yeah. If it'll get another cord, if, if the payment is worth less than two or $3, right?

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       Which means they can't collect it with a credit card. What they're doing is they're selling your data to advertisers. There are selling your identity, your demographics, your data to advertise a series here you're getting. You're having to give up things you don't give them up at that moment. You've given them a previously when you registered for the thing and verified your email and then verified your age and your gender and provided all of this demographic information which they then parcel often and gives to the advertisers, But you're still paying for the content. What you're paying by the fact that you can no longer engage with the web without it being filtered to what they think you want and who they think you are. Right? So you're getting this highly filtered pigeonholed view of content, and they do that using your information to present what they think you would like to watch based on what they've sold to the advertisers. You're no longer a customer, you're the product, the customer is the advertising agency. Whereas if you sell content directly, you reestablish the relationship of who is the creator

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       and who is the customer, the consumer of this content, and you cut out the middleman. Yeah, but you're cutting out advertising. Good luck. And also the other thing is like people don't want to pay even if it's a fraction of a penny, they just don't want to pay. I disagree. Do you think if people. There's a lot of dopes at watch youtube all day, like they sit in front of the coMputer, they slack jaw from morning to night and they just watch youtube videos. If they just calculated those fractions of a penny all day, that would be dollars and dollars every day, which would mean hundreds of dollars every few months or. Well, you got to think about this as a broader economy because a lot of these people could also earn a bath by making a a good comment, which actually ends up covering some of our costs of viewing. So you've got to think about.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       You can earn from comments. Yeah. That's where it gets really interesting. Blockchain, all this that you're talking about. No, you could do this with bitcoin. You could do this with blockchain. What is the difference between blockchain and bitcoin? Sorry to hijack that. No, no problem. Um, so blockchain is one of the technologies used in bitcoin. IT's a distributed database where all oF the transactions are linked together using cryptographic proofs. Um, bitcoin is one implementation of a blockchain. And blockchain has now been used as a maRketing term. That means very little. It's kind of like web to datto. We don't really know what it is. Right? It's a lot of datto yet. Yeah. Which is blockchain. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:54:55       That's ironic, isn't. It? Is. Yeah. And it's nebulous. Um, but the point is that you can do more than just currency. Um, earlier we were talking a bit about a trolling on twitter and other platforms like that before we started the live broadcast. Well, think about what a troll is doing. What they're doing is they're stealing attention. They're taking attention without contributing anything back to the community. Uh, there's an interesting and fairly effective market solution to this, which is instead of assigning someone to do oversight and decide who is and who isn't a troll and censor them, you basically allow people to contribute again, a minuscule fraction for the comments they like. They are power like thumbs up. But with each one of those likes and thumbs up, you attach a 10000th of a penny with it, you know, irrelevant, small, tiny money. Um, and then the people who write comments that are broadly appreciated, that add value to the community or in a tiny bit of money, not really anything serious, but if they tried to come and they have to spend a bit of that credit that they've earned that reputation that they've earned.

Speaker 3:          00:56:06       And if they're not a troll, it doesn't. It all comes out equal in the wash. They don't end up spending anything. They don't end up hurting anything. It's just participation in the community. But if they're a troll is suddenly starts getting interesting because now it gets expensive to steal the attention to the community because the less you have

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       positive feedback, the more expensive it gets for you to post until eventually you're priced out. BuT does that also,

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       they're also can kind of enforce or or encourage confirmation bias because if you go to a website that's just completely ridiculous and it's a message board filled with morons and you argue with them, it could cost you to argue with morons [inaudible] they're going to downhill you.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       Yeah, yeah. It could just choose to not comment, but you, you've got to think about this again, across a broader economy with a broader set of forums in which in some you are valued experts in other. You're the idiot who's arguing against the conventional wisdom and, and you know, you can actually balance these things out.

Speaker 1:          00:57:08       Well if you go to a flat earth forum and argue with those people and it costs you money.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       Yes. I had an argument with someone about chem trails. How did thAt go? It went really went very, very interestingly. I wasn't expecting them to change their mind, um, and they really wanted to hear my opinion and it was really interesting because we started the conversation. I said, okay, first I'm a pilot, I have a pilot's license, I fly small planes. that puts you at an extreme advantage. Yes. This conversation will you think you would think that it's. I mean, it's, it's not, it's not appeal to authority, right? It's saying those nozzles that you're pointing at, I know what those are. I have to, I have to walk around the plane before I take off and make sure all of them have correctly attached into the place they should be doing the things they should be doing. Otherwise I don't survive the flight.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       So you are a part of the chem trail sprayers, association of America,

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       what you're saying? Yes. So that was pretty much the conclusIon we reached. What are those nozzles? I'm actually in the, in the, in the ones pointing forward are called peto tubes and they're used to measure the velocity of the aircraft through the air by a pressure differential. And the ones pointing backwards are usually to break up of fortresses, these little swirly current severity that come off the wing, the cause turbulence, and you want to break those up so they don't swirl. Um, by the weight of the trails are clouds. How long have you been a shell with a water? The government. Indeed, of course. I'm michelle. I'm michelle for. Can't believe one of the things I'm interested in. Shut it off jamie. Yeah. I've had these conversations with people and frustrating you can present mountains of evidence if someone really, really doesn't want to believe they, they really will not belief. There's also,

Speaker 1:          00:59:05       I mean, it's been going on forever. I mean if you go back to the 19 forties, there's pictures black and White photos from world war one or world war two rather where you can see planes leaving behind these enormous trails. So it's a stupid argument. I mean, it really is. I mean, we've known for a long time that depending upon how much moisture is in the atmosphere, when planes pass through it, they will create clouds. And it's just real simple changes the temperature of the air. And it creates clouds and it's usually on hazy days. Not only that, but nasa has a website where you can go to it and it will accurately predict contrary. I was like, ooo, that that is, those are from propeller engines in the 19 forties. And what's happening is the propeller is compressing the air and when it compresses the air of the change in pressure changes the dewpoint and the dewpoint is what determines whether the error moisture consensus into a visible vapor into droplets that are clouds.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       And so by pushing a thing through the air, you're pressing on the air and when you press on the air is that causes condensation to form. And that conversation follows you in a circle, a cloud behind the plane. And this happens at any plane propeller plane that I, I've done it in a, in a four seater cessna that's smaller than a than a fiat sedan, right? And on a, on a, on a wet day, you can see little trails coming off the tips of the wings. and I pretty short and put any spray nozzles there or flip this. I didn't, I saw this, which it said chem trail them and I didn't flip it. I didn't, you don't how much liquid you would have to have in your plane in order to spray these enormous jets across the sky. I mean, it would be insane.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       It would be insane. I mean if the entire plane was filled up, I mean filled and you would have so much liquid that it will be visible from the ground floating in space. And then he talked to people, you know, I did that television show on scifi called joe rogan questions, everything. And one of the things that I questioned was chem trails. So I talked to a bunch of temp trill, air quote experts, and one of these guys had this study that he had done on water and the standing water study was proving that the spraying and the air was making aluminum. Uh, it was putting aluminum in the water and the water supply. And so he had this water tested. And so I, he showed me the test. I'm going over the test. I go, well, it says sludge. And he goes, well, it was water.

Speaker 1:          01:01:44       I gave them water, I go, okay, but it set sludge like the laboratory that you sent this stuff to says sludge and he and he was like, well, what is exactly sludge? What's the definition? I'm like, well, let's google it. So we googled sludge and with sledges is water mixed with dirt. So I said, okay, so your water mixed with dirt contains aluminum. Do you know how much aluminum there is in dirt? Because it's the exact amount that they tested when they tested the world. The water that you had with dirt. So what happened is your dirt tested positive for being dirt and you're using that as proof that the government is spraying the skies above everybody's head and you want to talk about like a piss poor cost ineffective shitbag program that does absolutely nothing. Chem trails would be it because it's not doing anything like no one's getting sick.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       There's no lake rise in illnesses. There's no like mind control going on. There's nothing. There is no mind control going on. There is no mind control going on. There Is no mind controlling. I mean it's the dumbest fucking thing. It can be easier to just put it in your municipal water supply. Yeah. Well I mean as arguments that are doing that too. It's. Well, of course, of course they move it with the planes to the spraying. It drops. It falls in the water supply. And then you drank something like that. Anyway. Yes, themselves too, by the way. But they're immune to it because there are lizards, you know they're down here too. So you spray the sky indiscriminately. I guarantee you some illuminati or getting sprayed. I'm going to get some hate mail for this. I know it well. Yeah, for sure. We're getting it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       People are wiping the cheetos off. They're greasy little fat fucking fingers right now in hammering at the keyboards. Ready to call a shills. It's the dumbest. It's what? There's a guy who runs, um, what is the website? Metta bunk. [inaudible] dot com. What is his name? Anyway? He, uh, he calls it the training wheels for conspiracy theorist because it's above your head. Are you seeing it all the time? You're like, what is going on up there? Why does that look very cloud? Like what is that when you started thinking, man, the government's doing something secretly. Yes. Mapquest. Thank you. Oh, metta bunk debunked. Look, mic west is a shill. He's a shill. Debunk, debunk, debunk, debunk, debunk it, but he got death threats and hate mail when he came on that tv show with me. Woo. Yeah, no, this is the guy. Yeah. This is. How does this hedge fund manager makes so much money?

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       Look at them. Just look at him. Sweating will get is. Look at this annual returns of 30 percent, 24 percent, or even 91 percent since 2013. Telling anybody how it's done. Just a computer program. You have to pay for a decade upfront and if you leave, he gets half the principal. Oh gee. I wonder how it works. Jesus fucking christ you crook clients. Hold on a second. Lose clients aren't sure how it's done. And joseph a myer junior, the man behind the obscure hedge fund, our our june lp is keeping his cards close. Oh, jesus christ. Invest most of his client's money and safe treasury bonds. Yeah, it's safe as fuck. If you can't take your money out for 10 years, you know, everybody in there can't take their money out for 10 years. That's insanity. That's insane that that's kind of like. I mean, you don't know this guy, but look at that. What's that? What is that? All right. I don't

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       know. I mean, if you had to guess, if I had to guess, I'm going to give you two options. Yeah. legit or scam. Yes. Um, I don't know. I would say it is most likely a ponzi scheme, which is outrageous. Something people throw around a lot. But here's the interesting thing is why do these schemes happen?

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       Right? what do you look at his offer? He offers an extraordinary guarantee with our june. You never lose money. Well, first of all, what kind of names?

Speaker 2:          01:05:50       I think that's actually part of the definition of investment fraud is guaranteed returns. So if you make a guarantee like that, it's usually one of the triggers that gets people investigated. He doesn't, but you never lose money.

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       Yeah. That's a great investment. That's fantastic. Investment should get involved. Maybe put some bitcoin in that and to solidify it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       Yeah, okay, I'm going to do the opposite. If you invest your money in bitcoin, you will lose money. Whoa. You will. You will gain money. You will lose money, you will gain money, you will lose. We don't know. That's no one is an. And I want to be really careful about this because many people go out and they push these things as investments and you can have a lot of volatility and sometimes when you have a lot of policies, some people get lucky and they make a lot of money and some people are great at picking their moment and they make some money

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       bail out. They make a ton of money. Like right now we're at 600 bucks. If you bought it back when it was like, what was it? The lowest point,

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       uh, the lowest, lowest point, lowest lowest, uh, about a thousandth of a dollar,

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       uh, thousands of a dollar to two to $600. He says, yeah, you could.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       Yeah. So I mean if you put in like a fucking big pile of money, yes, five grand and he took it out the wrong moment, you would lose all of it. And this is why this isn't, this isn't a speculative instruments. People can speculate in it, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       It isn't. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but isn't the well kind of poisoned the financial well with speculative investing like what, what people are doing, it seems like it shouldn't be legal and what's really fucked up about it is that they're doing it with algorithms and they're, they're gambling and they're, they're, they're buying and selling within like a fraction of a second and they're doing it in the point where there was a radiolab podcast where they talked about how investment firms. Did you see that one or listen to that one. I have heard that one yet. We're investment firms moved their servers closer to the exchange so that you get in there their orders and their exchanges quicker. There

Speaker 2:          01:08:04       is small on New Jersey where the data centers of the. None of the stock trading happens in manhattan. It happens across the water in New Jersey as a data center. There were probably largest amount of money moves ever and they have measured runs of fiber, meaning that in order to be fair, the fiber optic cable between the service that do the trading and every one of the racks that are in the room are measured to be the equal length so that the speed of light to limitation across a room of a hundred feet does not advantage one customer over another. Isn't that incredible? We're talking microseconds, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       Yeah. Well, people have been forced because of this, to move their offices from the middle of the country where they were to right there or rent space where their servers are right there. It's really. It's so bizarre because a lot of this stuff is actually done with computers, so these computers are operating on an algorithm. The algorithms recognize patterns. They start these exchanges and they buy and sell and buy and sell and buy and sell and do all of this within fractions of a second.

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       Yeah. Over the last decade, most trading floors have seen 90 percent of their traders disappear. So they're empty rooms, you can see photos all that to align where it shows before and after photos of very big banks like ubs and jp morgan, goldman sachs, companies like that. So you see their trading Floor and it is empty because a lot of that has now moved to algorithmic trading. So strange. What a weird, weird way to invest in bias. Thank you. Oh my god. That's the before and after and it's not because they're making less money. Right. This is not. This is not a downturn. This during this time they've actually made more money,

Speaker 1:          01:09:48       but there's something about those stock exchange videos that were in movies, you know by, by sal, sal and they've got their hands up and there I want to have these and five of these and they're holding up pieces of paper that is so daunting. All that stuff is so confusing to a person on the outside looking at that and trying to figure out what the fuck those people are doing. Like it seems exciting and chaotic and vibrant but so confusing.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       Right. But that is. That is the american economy right now. Essentially it's based on confidence all that's happening. Yeah. So should we talk about a slightly different topic? Sure. Whatever you want. I want to tell you about some of the new developments that are happening in bitcoin, which I find interesting and I'm not going to show because this is not really about a company or a specific product, but I want to talk about one of the things that has me excited, which is a, um, what happens when you combine a technology that looks very much like peer to peer napster or bit torrens with a merchant service like [inaudible] bay and you create this hybrid technology which is a completely peer to peer, um, store service called open bazaar. And, and this is basically a system where you run on your computer some software and you can open a store to delivery the physical goods or virtual goods, have them listed, have them found by others, and then all of the payments are done in bitcoin.

Speaker 2:          01:11:26       So by decentralizing the payment system, we can also decentralize the store system completely. And it is a completely borderless multinational, uh, open and peer to peer open source software merchant system running on top of bitcoin, which I just find fascinating. The ability for anyone to open a store, especially in countries where you don't have ebay. Right. And be able to sell goods and services anywhere in the world and receive payments in bitcoin. And does this operational right now? Yup. And I'm selling that book, uh, on open bazaar. So how does one access openbazaar to the, to the luddite? They run software, no fees, no restriction. And they downloads the software, run it on their computer funds a bit bitcoin wallet and which sits on their computer. They don't have to give their money. Twenty one. There was no intermediaries. And you buy directly from the store and the person running the store is running the same software.

Speaker 2:          01:12:35       Well, let's see what some of the things that they have available. We went to openbazaar.org. I have to download the program so to find another way to look at it. Oh, okay. Yeah. If you go to, um, do. Oh, search is a search engine on top d u o s e a r c h. So duo search. Yeah. So because this is an open protocol and because all of the listings are in a peer to peer network, you can just go online and run a search engine and create a search engine that searches the store. Wow. This is the third party that just has a search engine for searching the store. So you can um, you can search online there and tell him what you're looking for and find something from tee shirts to gary and find my bank. Okay. But no, that's not what I want to buy a flip phone.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       Go back there. You can get a phone for ari. What's going on there? A lot of these darks are going to flip phones now. 20 bucks for a cryo. Sarah or that's an lg lg 44 damn bargain. Have you ever thought about going flip phone? me? Yeah. no, I'm, I'm in the opposite category. I haven't actually received a phone call on my phone probably in three years and I don't have a phone I had out of here. I have a portable computer which also has a phone function on it that I keep switched off. You keep it off pretty much. Yeah. It doesn't bring ever. It doesn't every text you um, but people text you. Um, yes, but that actually gets redirected to my email. So I don't do texts.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       I, I, I do it through either hangouts or email. So when I send you a text, it doesn't really appeal to you as a text? No, it comes through to a google hangouts. You are one of the weirdest guy. I know. I use it as a portable computer. It's my communicator device. The phone function is irrelevant to me. Well, don't You ever want to talk to people? Don't you go, hey man, how you doing? Um, I do video talks most of the time. I know. I'm worried. OkaY. Uh, when I talk to people, it's on where they're selling cbd oil, cbd oil, organic, pure, raw, natural cbdc. That is where the god damned government's going to come in and close this whole thing down. What do you guys do? And mitigating pain. You pieces oF shit. We're going to come in with dogs and bite you.

Speaker 3:          01:14:55       Yeah. They're probably actually only selling that's within oRegon within a jurisdiction where it's legal, right? Because they can sell it within that jurisdiction from that jurisdiction and it's perfectly legal in Colorado. It's growing and getting insides. It's funny, we're talking about how weird you are. He showed up. Uh, andrews has a apple laptop and I was like, how dare you walk in here with an apple product? I expect you to have some linux box. And of course he's running linux on his apple compuTer. Well, I'm also running linux. I'm running a bunch of things, but yeah, it's a beautiful piece of hardware. I like it. That doesn't mean that like everything else the company does or will, you just don't like the restrictive aspects of it. Yeah. Yeah. You're all android, right? Yes, I am on my. What are you using now? Which I have a nexus five.

Speaker 3:          01:15:44       Oh, that's okay. So this is the newest and the latest greatest of the google phones. So it runs the pure google or did you know carrier branding? It's I bought, I own the phone, right? It's not a lease. Well, those, the newest, latest and greatest android phones, or at the very least commensurate with the newest and latest and greatest I iphones, I think the theme average person, the slight differences in hardware really are irrelevant at this point. While it does matter, however, is watch You can and can't do with the software and how much of your life at controls and how much privacy you have with the software that you run on these devices. As You may have noticed, I'm all about control and privacy. Being able to control my money, control my devices, control my privacy. I think that's, that should be a principle that we should all celebrate. It's, it's a fundamental freedom and we're gradually losing it. Well, I'm a big fan of options as well, so I'm happy that, uh, androids come along and created options, right? Because it was for a long time. It was like, yeah, it's an option, but it sucks. Right. And now it's, it's not just me. The galaxy s seven. Have you ever messed with that? The samsung galaxy s seven, but I've seen it. Yeah. It's a phenomenal phone. It is easily as good as an iphone. It's amazing phone.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Throw it into a gear vr headsets and you get fully immersive vr that is mindblowing. Yeah. I actually have a little headset that I can put this phone into, into vr.

Speaker 1:          01:17:21       That stuff's good, but it's not as good as the htc vive. MY friend duncan duncan trussell as the vive.

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       AlrIght. I also paid $30 for my headset is what? 1,200?

Speaker 1:          01:17:34       It's probably something like that. Slight difference in price. Yes. There's definitely differences in price, but it is, it's very encouraging that not only is there a competitor to apple but it is actually an equal now, you know, and I just think the more options people have like that, the better there are for everybody and it, it'd be nice if there was a commensurate operating system because there's not really.

Speaker 2:          01:17:57       Well no, not really. Um, for, for geek heads like me, it's linux, but essentially what happened is because linux was so successful, it became android. Android was built on top of linux. Essentially it is at its very core, it is linux, right? But why don't they make, um, that kind of an operating system for a computer, for a laptop, um, because from what I can tell, really laptops are gradually disappearing. The laptop market is disappearing really, really fast today. There were some announcements from apple. They're changing some of their operating system commitments, but they're making the seven. Yeah, they're making the operating system more and more like ios and gradually diminishing the importance of, of laptops because most people do pretty much everything they need to do on their smartphones. Nowadays.

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       It is, it, it makes a difference that it's nice that I can take my phone with me. I have the larger iphone that I use most of the time and I also have a samsung phone, but the larger iphone that I use most of the time I can take with me and I don't feel like I'm missing a laptop, but if I need to work on and get some stuff done, I want a laptop keyboard. I want to. If I'm writing especially I want to be able to work. Yeah, you know, I want to be able to also plug in headsets and listen to music while I'm working and also have power at the same time. And so there's a lot of. I'm a big fan of actual computers. I like an actual computer at home with an attached keyboard and a real monitor. I mean just, I just think those things. There's some benefits of those things to someone who writes in particular. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       Do you think the great american novel is being written by thumbs right now?

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       Well, Steven Wright was writing a whole book and tweets. Yeah. Yeah. He was writing a novel in tweets on a real keyboard book. Money were for people who are listening. So what else is exciting for you right now about

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       bitcoin? So I think one of the things we've seen that, that has been quite interesting is that it has become easier and easier and to use and easier to get into bitcoin and easier to use bitcoin in your everyday life. I remember a time when it was very, very difficult to do all of those things. Now there are probably six or 700 exchanges around the world. Uh, you talked about mt. Gox in Japan, the first bitcoin exchange, the really the first major bitcoin exchange at the time it was the exchange, there were no others and that was both a single point of failure and a weakness for bitcoin as it proved. Um, buT it also made it very difficult. Now there are at least four or five major exchanges operating in the us, very easy to access, um, access the system to connect it to maybe to a bank account or a debit card.

Speaker 2:          01:20:57       And two, if you want to convert dollars to bitcoin or bitcoin to dollars. Uh, I'm mostly on the other side. I earn bitcoin and then I converted into dollars to pay for things. The, I campaign bitcoin, very easy to do that. Um, that's a major advancement that makes it much easier for people to get involved as much as they want. They don't have to earn everything they don't have to do. There's a company called between age, uh, which allows you to take a percentage of your paycheck and have it sent to you in bitcoin. Um, and it's very easy for an employer to set it up with any of their traditional payroll systems where they say, you can say, just like, I'm going to put two percent of my account into a savings account and a 98 percent into my checking account. A lot of companies offer that.

Speaker 2:          01:21:47       Well now you can say, and I also want to put two percent of my paycheck every month into this. And to the employer, it looks like a routing number and account number, but on the other end it gets converted into bitcoin and send to your bitcoin wallet. So you can very easily incorporate this as part of your everyday life. Now here's another thing, I'm going to try and show this in a way that doesn't cause me a big problem with my finances, but how it, it caused you a big problem if someone sees something to show the credit card number. Oh, I see. So this is a, this is a super crypto bitcoin credit card. It's a bitcoin debit card and basically it operates. I'm one of the exchanges in the us offers this and there's actually tore three in the us that now offer this kind of service.

Speaker 2:          01:22:38       Now, what's behind this is a bitcoin wallet. So I don't have dollars in this. I have bitcoin in this, but when I went to the coffee shop or I got this coffee earlier today, I swipe this. And um, did they look at you sideways? No, I mean they can't tell they they see a visa card. It says visa on the front says debit visa. It doesn't say bitcoin anywhere. um, and so I make a payment and I get a little message on my phone that says we've debited zero point zero, zero, zero, two bitcoin from your account for your purchase at the coffee shop. So you can even tip them in bitcoin. Yes. Here's where it gets interesting. You know, I tRavel all around the world, do these talks and these conferences. So I'm constantly on the road and I've tried again and again with my bank account to tell them, listen, I travel.

Speaker 2:          01:23:27       When are you traveling, sir? All the time. Where are you traveling next? Oh, 16 different countries in the next seven months. Can you just put a note somewhere in my account that says do not Block his visa if it shows up somewhere we don't expect because this person travels. American express can do it. My bank can't. They simply can't. They want me 24 hours before I leave to call them and give them a specific list of places that I'm going to be. Um, and when I don't do that, when I tried to use my card, it gets blocked until I come back to the us and talk to them on the phone and a whole bunch of questions about whether it was really me who bought, you know, a pastry in prague or something like that. And then that all block it. And what's happened repeatedly in the last few months is I'll go somewhere, my card will get blocked because I forgot to tell them and then I'll pull out the line card and it works everywhere without fail because it's a prepaid because it's a debit everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:24:24       Without fail, if I need to move more money into it, if I need to take money cash out of an atm when I'm traveling, I can use this and it's so much easier. I can simply transfer bitcoin into that account and 10 minutes later I can withdraw that in cash in any currency in any country. You say that it was such glee. It's convenience. So excited about you are. You can't hide it. But yeah, I get it. I get excited about these things because it makes it easy for me to use bitcoin, right? And, and yes, it's visa as the evil empire, the banking system, etc. Etc. But for many people who are going to experience bitcoin as an additional currency in their life when they use for online purchases, having the flexibility to use both and making it easier and more transparent is how you get to mainstream adoption, especially in the developed world.

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       Now, how would someone get ahold of one of those cards? How did, how did they just open an account with an exchange? They have to do all of the patriot act, bank secrecy act, show me id, proof of residence, et cetera, et cetera. But in the end they get a visa card and what exchanges are available for getting visa debit cards like that. Like can you name some? Sure. Uh, in the us a coinbase, coinbase.com, uh, and bitpay bitpay.com. Both offer a visa debit cards, uh, in many countries around the world, uh, zappo x, a p o offer a debit card and there's a, there's a bunch of others. There's a bunch of others. interesting. That's interesting. That's actually very promising because that makes it practical. Yes, so that's one side. Then a few other things that have happened in this space. Certainly we have seen a lot of the banking industry realized that they could actually use this technology and not just fear it and you know, we have this and I certainly bring this view of banks as giants, kara couture, dinosaur evil things, but within them there's just normal people, right?

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       So swept up in the institutional inertia of this beast, but there's people who, some of them get it, they get this is exciting and interesting and disruptive. They want to use it within the banking system and they're trying to work from within to get people interested in this and we're seeing more and more of these organizations gradually try to find ways to adopt this technology to streamline and to improve banking itself. This is very similar to what we saw in the early nineties when the internet started happening muCh more mainstream. The phone companies at first fought it tooth and nail, right? They fought. The service providers tried not to give them access to their lines, try not to kick them off. The knock of them dsl networks at the tIme. Um, they faulted the fcc, they tried to control it, and eventually they all became isbns, right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:23       So eventually jumped on the bandwagon and use it to improve their own infrastructure. Now, if you make a phone call on a regular traditional old phone, your phone call is going over the internet, almost 90 percent sure that it is. So they wouldn't let the internet beyond the phone network. Now the entire phone network is on the internet. Well, if flipped, that's called infrastructure inversion. Um, in the early days of the automobile, they wouldn't let automobiles in towns too because they would disrupt the horses, the horse traffic, right? And they had all kinds of weird laws, including in the uk, they passed the law, which required someone to run ahead of the Car with a red flag. I call the red flag act. That did wonders for the british automobile industry, which was 20 years ahead at the time. And then wasn't, um, wow. That kind of reactionary behavior is very common in new technologies and then infrastructure and version happens eventually.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       The thing that was considered impossible, the roads will be paved to make automobile travel, practical everywhere happens and horses were quite happy to ride on paved roads, right? Uh, whereas for automobiles was almost impossible to use in a rutted, muddy road when you have a four wheel drive vehicle trying to compete against a four wheel drive animal. And in those early days they pointed that that said, look, this thing is never going to work. Automobiles and never going to happen because you don't have the infrastructure, but if you have the need infrastructure happens, and we've seen that with, with the automobile up with electricity, we've seen that with the internet. We seen that with all of these technologies and now we're going to see it again with money because if you have this technology, building the banking institutions on top of this is easy, but making bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, making the internet of money play by the rules of the old banking system is almost impossible.

Speaker 2:          01:29:24       Now I like that expression, crypto currency and crypto currencies. One is the stop banks from creating their own cryptocurrency and what I mean, what is so wonderful about bitcoin in comparison to other cryptocurrencies? Now, that's a great question. There's nothing to stop them. In fact, they're already doing it. There are, yes. First of all, you've got to realize there's more than a thousand cryptocurrencies already. A thousand. Yes. More than a thousand dollars. What's the worst one? Was the one we should avoid that, that list is almost 900 long. Oh yeah. I mean, it's a long tail, right? Um, there's a couple that are interesting that offer different perspectives. Um, but we're, we're seeing a lot of private institutions interested in creating their own, um, and there's nothing stopping them from doing that, but they have to make a fundamental choice. They can either create some things that is controlled, contained with specific outlines and borders, with controlled access, permissioned access, as they would call it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:31       Um, and that by definition is not global. It can be global. It has to be contained within a specific jurisdiction because that's how they operate. Both corporations and banks operate within specific jurisdictions so they can do that, um, but then it has to be close to innovation, close to permission and not global and transnational, and so what? Bitcoin has a, not just bitcoin, but any public open cryptocurrency of a global nature like bit coin is that you don't need to ask permission to join. You don't need to ask permission to innovate. You don't need to ask permission to create a new application and any application, you're right will instantaneously work anywhere in the world to anyone without permission. That's the magic of bitcoin and if you think about that, that's also the magic of the internet. That's why the internet has been successful because it allows anyone to join without permission connect to any application or service.

Speaker 2:          01:31:32       They won't write an application and launch it globally without tasking the phone company if they're allowed to do that, there's no one to ask permission from. And to extend that analogy, they also tried to build private internet and they're still trying compuserve, aol, prodigy, and the early closed networks that had their own content that you could connect to. The part of the internet and then after that corporates internets, have you heard of the internet term? Right. So when you have an internal network within a company that has stale content, crappy applications and doesn't talk to the rest oF the world, and it's behind firewalls, that's an intRanet, intra and tra and they've built those and they sometimes serve very useful purposes, but they're not the internet And you can't scale them and make them secure and make them useful enough. So essentially that would be

Speaker 1:          01:32:30       exactly be what would happen with money if local banks or national banks.

Speaker 2:          01:32:36       Yes. So to follow from the title, the internet of money is a very powerful expression because it really explains what this is. This is the internet of money, which means it's open, borderless global, and requires no permission to participate and people will try to create the intranet of money and it will have all of the limitations that the traditional banking system has. So yes, they can come along and do that. Um, and the nIce thing is that people don't have to make a choice to use one or the other. The only system of monopoly we have is that you have to use the national currency of the country you were born in and you live in, in order to pay the government of that country. Other than that, you're free to use any currency you want anywhere. some of us are free, many of us are not, and bitcoin fits into that model. It's the if you want to use it for this particular use, use it

Speaker 1:          01:33:37       well. If, if you extrapolate where all this stuff is going, if you look at. I mean if you're correct and if over the next 20 years, bitcoin really does emerge as not just an acceptable currency worldwide, but it's right up there with everything else and and maybe even preferred by a lot of people that are in the know or tech savvy or what have you. If that really does take place, it's going to slowly but surely erode a lot of the major problems that we have with society today as far as this government having massive amounts of control over the economy and the banks being the ones who sort of enforce the kind of laws that have allowed the mortgage crisis is and I'll allow these bubbles to occur and also to fund and help fund the politicians that enable them to keep these laws in place. I mean all of That sort of is a lot of that is because of power and a lot of that power is going to go away if something like cryptocurrencies emerge as being the predominant way that we use and exchange money.

Speaker 2:          01:34:50       That's the optimistic way to look at it. Yeah. The less optimistic way to look at it is that over the decade we're going to gradually move into a cashless digital money society. We're kind of doing that now with apple. We are doing that already and there are some countries that are completely cashless, really were that are very close to completely cashless the ironically one of the. One of the countries that has a very high degree of, um, digital money is Kenya because of empaysah, which is the mobile money they have, which has now taken over a significant percentage of the gdp. We're also seeing in scandinavian countries now, cash is less than, I think is less than eight percent of, um, of the productive use of money and other using credit cards is what you're saying. I credits debits mobile pay, uh, what is kenya's mpa? What is that?

Speaker 2:          01:35:48       And paste it as a text message. Text message money. Yeah. It's money you can send through sms. it started off as basically people exchanging minutes, mobile minutes that were transferable by sms and they started using it as currency and then eventually it became officially a corresponding currency to the kenyan pesa. Announced the predomInant currency. Um, it's, yeah, in most places. From what I understand, uh, I haven't been to Kenya, but I've talked to a lot of kenyans who told me, yeah, we, we all use that. And only that we don't use cash. We don't use credit cards. Wow. It is kind of shocking, but here's the problem. The problem is we are going to a digital current society where cash will be gradually eradicated either through non use or a lot of countries and a lot of governments are trying to actively ban it so they're putting limits on how much you can use cash, say you know, a thousand dollars and if it's more than a thousand dollars using cash as illegal when we go to the society, we have to really think about the implications.

Speaker 2:          01:36:53       Do we want a society in which our digital money is under complete surveillance and complete control where if you go to the wrong protest or if you support the wrong political campaign or if you make a payment to the wrong person or receive money from the wrong person, suddenly your money disappears. It's no longer yours anymore. It's frozen, it's seized, it's gone. Um, and someone has control of that. Corporations, banks, governments, and in most cases there is no difference between corporation, bank and government. Right? Um, and so that's one scenario. And the other scenario is one in which individuals control their money and it is digital money, but it's digital cash like bitcoin, where you can pay an individual from one person to another just like I can with cash today without tiny other party getting involved. What really strikes me as amazing is that we've gotten used to this idea so quickly, which is that we no longer pay people, we no longer pay people directly.

Speaker 2:          01:37:58       The less we use cash is the more we pay people through a corporation. Right? So from tipping your valet to tipping your taxi driver to tipping wherever tipping is pretty much the last remaining part of our society and where cash is used to pay from one person who is not an incorporated entity to another person who is not an incorporated entity. Everything else you have to pay through a corporation, whether it's a bank, right? Whether it's venmo, whether it's paypal, whether it's any of those things. And we've gradually gotten used to this environment where we can't pay another person unless there's a corporation involved.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       And that's astonishing to me. And as cash disappears, that then becomes a final fact that every single payment in your life will be from you to a corporation and the corporation takes a piece of that every single thing and not just that, it doesn't just take a piece, it also controls and surveils and monitors your use. And if you violated the terms and Conditions, you are destitute. Wow. So are. So the issue is not what we have today versus the digital currency of the future or bitcoin or whatever. It's both futures are digital currency and in both futures. Cash will no longer exist. That is inevitable. We are going down that road and now we have to choose. Do we go to the digital, cashless society of corporate control over money with the complete and total merging of corporates and state money

Speaker 2:          01:39:38       where instead of having separation of state and money have the merging of states and money and corporation and money where your money is branded money, you have chase dollars, you have goldman sachs dollars, you have coca cola dollars, right? You have money that is controlled by a corporation or do we go down the other future where we have money that is basically an internet protocol that is completely global, that any person can pay any person they meet in the streets without any corporations getting involved just for me to you digital cash and that's really the. It's a less optimistic view because I'm fully aware of what the other future is and it's already playing out and it is a very, in my opinion, a very dangerous future.

Speaker 1:          01:40:24       This is so fascinating to me because it's so speculative and I love when you don't know what's going to happen and someone presents a bunch of different scenarios and you get the mind starts to wander in and then you also sort of plan for the future. Like it becomes something to. It almost become something to look forward to our bet on. You know like, boy, I bet it's going to work like this or I bet you because we really don't know what I mean and what. What is the resistance that bitcoin is facing from standard financial institutions that are in control right now? Because there must be some form of, of resistance. And is there any fuckery involved? Like is there any sabotaging of bitcoin that has been suspected or proven?

Speaker 2:          01:41:09       I think I don't really know if there's any sabotaging going on. So that's, that's um, that's expected. I'm not going to make any, any claims, just wink at me. Tell him what to say. Well, what I'm going to talk about is the progression of what happens when a giant, well established financial institution that's been around for 50 years or 100 years is faced with a disruptor that they cannot tamp down. They cannot shut down sue by coopt eradicate band legislates against. Right? And, and what happens then is what I call the five stages of grief. First we start with denial. So, and, and we saw this play, I think exactly like this with the banking industry. The first reaction was denial. Bitcoin can't possibly work. It's not real money. It doesn't really exist. It has no value. It will never survive. Fast forward five years, you keep making that argument.

Speaker 2:          01:42:10       It becomes less and less credible because it's not real money yet. The big metal bird that brought me to los angeles today was paid, was not money, so you can claim it's not money all day long and I've been living on it for three years, which kind of undermines the argument, right? If I earn it tonight, spend it, and people give me rides and big metal birds, it's money. Um, so that isn't working. It's going to go away on its own. It's going to die. It's going to lose all its value. Every time it dumps in value, they cheer. It's like finally bitcoin is dead. They write another obituary, we publish them on bitcoin. Obituaries.com to make fun of them later. Now has 110 obituaries I think published. Every time they say will die, which is every two months. Again, denial only works for a while. Then they go into anger. It's the money of terrorists, criminals, pedophiles, pornographers, and the unsavory elements of this world. Pedophiles. That's always the one they pull out,

Speaker 1:          01:43:15       right? Oh, they love to use that one. Yeah. If they find one by one pedophile, he uses bitcoin. Pedophile kern.

Speaker 2:          01:43:23       Yeah, exactly. I'm dirty trick. It is a bit of a, it is a bit, a bit of a dirty trick and they've tried to do this again and again and again. They did it with the internet, right? The internet, when it first came out, they, you heard this media narrative, the, it's, it sells papers. It sell, it didn't sell clicks at the time because they were doing, it's about the internet, but it sells papers, which is the idea that the internet is a haven of crooks and fraudsters, terrorists and pedophiles and pornography. Great. Um, yes, criminal use of advanced technology, criminal use, the most advanced technology they can get their hands on because they're in a very highly competitive, high margin, high risk business. And of course they're going to say they criminals wear shoes to run away from bank heist criminals drive cars to get away from bank robberies.

Speaker 2:          01:44:14       They use cell phones to coordinate with each other. They drink water. So it is not to die of dehydration. We're not going to ban all of those things. Right. And so you have that anger. Um, and they tried that for awhile. Um, every time they try that, you just turn around and say, oh, well, you know, actually the biggest money launderers of drugs in the world are hsbc, the Hong Kong, Hong Kong, shanghai banking consortium. Inconvenient fact is that this is the laundry is in the world. Yes, they would call it the model new laundering $700,000,000,000 for the sinaloa cartel over a period of 10 years during which 19,000 people died in Mexico as a direct result of that. Um, and they got a fine and no one went to jail. So there are inconvenient facts like that. Every time they say bitcoin funds terrorism, you say, oh, I see them driving toyota's and humvees.

Speaker 2:          01:45:14       Um, right. Uh, that doesn't, that's a bit incongruence. Like they're, they're driving around in the vehicles. We left behind and there they got a lot of their funding from pallets of money that we left behind and they're getting paid for dollar in dollars for oil that they're selling to our closest allies. We shouldn't really mentioned Saudi Arabia. Um, so these are the inconvenient truths, right? So you don't talk about these in polite company or at least you do like, that's what I said when I was invited to the, to speak in front of the senate in Canada and they started asking me about terrorism and I said to actually mostly funded by our allies. And what did they say when you do that? That was the end of that train of thought. They stopped, you know, it was live public tv, but what, what, like what went down when we moved on to talk about more realistic and interesting things in a much more positive view of what this thing is.

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       So they tried to discredit bitcoin by attaching it to terrorism and you informed them of the facts of where terrorists are actually funded from. Yes. In a very public forum on live tv, which was very difficult to continue that line of conversation. So that's anger. Is there a resistance in Canada? Like there is in the United States? No, actually, um, the, they've been very, very positive, very positive to, towards, um, towards cryptocurrencies in general. Yeah. Interesting. And there's a lot of development going on. There isn't that much resistance in the United States. Really. The banks were shutting down bank accounts. In some cases. We've seen that in the United Kingdom to what is the right right now, what's the percentage of people that are using bitcoin on a regular basis? It's very difficult to say, um, primarily because there is no clear association between one person in one bitcoin address or I can't.

Speaker 2:          01:47:07       There is no account right to, to use bitcoin. All you have to do is download an application on your phone. Nobody. You don't have to register anything. And so as a result, it's just like how many ip addresses are in use. Does that tell you anything about how many people are using the internet? You can't really tell. That's a good thing. It's because of its nature. I would say we're probably looking at about two to 4 million users based on. It's very interesting based on activity levels, based on logins to websites that some of them, the published results. It's very hard to say for sure exactly how many mostly concentrated in the us at the moment. So it's plus or minus one percent, somewhere in the range of one percent of, of the United States population. Oh no. This is globally, globally, globally, globally. Maybe two to 4 million people.

Speaker 2:          01:47:56       You said most of them are in the United States. Most of them in the United States. Many of them are also in China. So was a $4 million. It is possible. That's one percent of maybe yes, less. Yes, maybe half a percent or something like that. That's interesting. That's a lot. But what is happening is it's doubling every year in terms of transaction volume, transaction amounts, number of everything is doubling every year. And that's, that's the kind of characteristic curve you see in disruptive technologies being adopted. And that's a very promising curve. What is the tipping point like what needs to happen? Is there anything that needs to happen for, for widespread adoption, you've got to need it. Uh, it's got to be ready and it's got to be easy to use. And so right now it's not easy to use. It's not ready for adoption. And in many parts of the developed world, we don't really need it.

Speaker 2:          01:48:51       So in order to make it something we need either what we already have has to not work so well. This is what's happening in the developing world where you have banking crisis, which drives people into a safe haven or you invent to applications that couldn't be done before, a self driving car that you pay by the mile. I'm automatically, as you're driving along, I'm a, I'm a micro payments industry for paying for contents directly. Um, the internet of things where devices can buy services online automatically. Things that you can do with credit cards. I think if you start seeing applications like that to merge and I'm very confident they're coming because we're seeing the innovation behind them, then you can make it something that is more needed even in the developed world. So what, what do you think could be done to sort of further this along or to accelerate this?

Speaker 2:          01:49:51       Is there anything that can be done? Um, as I said, I think the third ingredient is making it easier for people to use and that's a matter of innovation and maturity and we're doing that. I mean, that's already happening. Other than that, it's just a matter of time, we just have to wait and be patient until it happens. What could be like the steps that can be taken to make something like bitcoin easier to use? Well, there's a lot of things to do. Um, user interfaces, design, security, making backup, etc. Providing infrastructure services, exchanges, uh, uh, your paycheck, your atm services, your debit card services, merchant services, things like that. Um, well, one of the examples I like to use is I got on the internet in 1989. I sent my first emails shortly thereafter about 1990 and in order to send my first email I had to have a unix command line skills, a login into a unix mainframe with access to an internet connection at an academic institution.

Speaker 2:          01:50:54       And then I worked very hard for about two days to get the software working. And then eventually I sent an email and then it took a couple of days to cross the internet. Right. And then almost exactly 20 years later, my mom went, swipe and did the same thing on her ipad. So when you take, you know, two days of compiling software writing complex unix command, sending an email, it takes a while to get across the internet and then 20 years later that's down to swipe when we can take a coin from after install a wallet to understand what it is, the qr code of the bitcoin address and how do I back it up and secure it, et cetera, and you turn that into swipe. Then we'll be ready. But there isn't there a vast difference though between something like email, which is not just a disruptive technology but a completely new innovation.

Speaker 2:          01:51:47       The ability to send things wirelessly through the air or even wired like electronic mail did not exist but. But males but mail did. I mean it was just a change in the medium. Essentially you're doing correspondence but it's so much easier and more convenient. Whereas like using a credit card right now is fairly convenient for gas or online banking. Fairly convenient for people who have credit cards and now that's, that's where the numbers really benefit bitcoin because we're, we're in the age of the internet and instead of economic inclusion becoming crater instead of more people around the world having ready access to these technologies, we're seeing entire country's getting cut off from economic inclusion. The banking system is not expanding as fast to reach these populations. And there's this vast gap left and this gap is several billion people into that gap. You can fit anyone who has access to even a rudimentary, a feature phone or smartphone with a very basic level of data service.

Speaker 2:          01:52:51       Um, so the level at which you need to have technology in order to, for someone to adopt bitcoin and immediately become in themselves, a global bank in the back pocket of their pants compare to the level that you would need to reach before jpmorgan chase built a branch within their area and offer them services after going through a very careful verification of their identity and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's never gonna happen. So we're going to get to leapfrogging effect, just like in many places in africa. The first leapfrog a event we saw that was noted upon people wrote books about this is the fact that in many places in africa, landlines were never deployed because the the difficulty to actually extend landlines was so high that when cell phones came along, at some point it became easier to just go directly to cell phones and bypass that entire generation of technology. Right? So we're expecting an. I certainly see it as very possible to see a leap frogging and economic inclusion, the ability for people to join the internet of money long before they ever see a bank. The end result is it's not just about banking, the unbanked, it's about debunking all of us. Banking is an application. You don't need an institution, you just need an application. And that that transition is pretty powerful.

Speaker 1:          01:54:22       Is there any concern that people would take people's phones and hold them at gunpoint and just steal all their bitcoin? Like if that's all you own, like if you have a wallet, that wallet is all you own. If you're on bitcoin 20 years from now, whatever it is, and that's your entire financial portfolio exists in your phone and someone can come along and force you at gunpoint to transfer that over their phone and then they take off in the night.

Speaker 2:          01:54:44       Yeah. Uh, well, first of all already today, you wouldn't keep your entire financial portfolio on your phone. I certainly don't. Um, there are a number of very convenient and easy to use devices that allow you to store your bitcoin securely on an offline device. Um, I have a couple of my bag, I might show them to you later, which you might, but you might not mean if you want to show them to you now, you might just say, okay, let's see.

Speaker 1:          01:55:12       The way you said it was just like teasing me. This is for people at home that are listening to this. You're like, I don't know what to make of this.

Speaker 2:          01:55:25       I didn't want to get wrapped up in the, uh, headphones for it. And why is that? So this is a device that a lot of people in bitcoin are familiar with. Can we see that? Yeah. Yeah. So this is called a bitcoin tresor.

Speaker 1:          01:55:40       It looks like one of those things, those old ladies press when they fall down. Yes. I've fallen

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       and I can't get out. Yes, it's a bit different. Um, so this is a usb device. I can connect it to my computer. Can I see it? Yes, please. Well, all your money now. So I feel weird. You don't have all my money. You have got it. So I have a, I have a backup of that device and this is where what I mentioned before is this 12 to 24 word backup that I have, which means that if I lose that device, um, I can recreate. It's on my backup device which I'm carrying here. Alright. The second one, I have a second one. I actually have four of these and you can transfer that 24 words seed to any device you want and it will immediately have access to all of your money. It would render this. No. Yes. Well, I mean it won't render this one now because it can coexist on all of them, but that one has a pin number and a pass phrase that you have to put in.

Speaker 2:          01:56:37       He would not be able to break into that device could. Yeah. Maybe most people can't. I'm good at that shit dude. Yeah. Excellent. But is it possible that someone could figure out a way to crack your 24 word code? No, no, no. You say that man, don't say that online. I, I say that fucking hackers man, they take that shit as a challenge. Never say you can't hack me. Here's the thing. Bitcoin in itself is the world's largest bug bounty and this is something that most people have been realized, but bounty a bug bounty is when a manufacturer of a piece of software, for example, puts out a bunting bounty and says, I'll give you a $10,000 if you find a bug in my software that someone could exploit to break my software. Apple does bug bounties. Google does bug bounties. A lot of companies do these bug bounties.

Speaker 2:          01:57:30       It's very wise and it's great because what they do is that way they. They find these, they have professional packers really who go in and break the software and it's legal. They do it perfectly. Yeah, but another way to look at this is the bitcoin has 10 to $12,000,000,000 of market capitalization behind it and if you can find a way to break, say my 24 words seed, you have access to my money, so my money is the bounty that sitting behind that bug and this means that bitcoin is being tested and has been tested every single day of his seven year existence with an ever increasing jack bolt at the end of it, which is why you see bitcoin exchanges. When they don't do good security, they get hacked and whoever hacks them gets the bounty, but bitcoin itself, which has the biggest bounty of them all remains secure and the reason to remain secure, it's not magical.

Speaker 2:          01:58:26       It's about spreading out the risk in such a way that there is no single points you can put your thumb on and attack. So anyway, this little device, these types of devices, there are ones that have a fingerprint scanner on them that are easy to use there or they come in various form factors. We call these hardware wallets. And what's interesting about this is that the bitcoin keys that control my bitcoin are created on this device. They remain on this device and this device signs transactions, which means I can take it and I can plug it into this laptop and if this laptop is compromised, I don't care, it will not be able to compromise this. I can take this and I can plug it in to the, you know those desktops they have in hotel lobbies where you can print your boarding pass. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:59:19       Consider that the cesspool of computing you. You go there. That thing has 25 different viruses fighting for dominance, right? Once you plug into device, they start tearing each other apart, trying to get to your device. I can plug this in there and make a bitcoin transaction and not have to worry about that because the keys stay on here, right. And no one can figure out a virus for one of those. Well, that's the thing. This is designed specifically to have a very, very narrow well defined interface. So the only thing you can send to it is a bitcoin transaction. It then displays that bitcoin transaction on the screen and I can decide, is that who I actually wanted to pay? Yes. Confirm. And then I've paid them and nobody else. Is it impossible to integrate a virus into a bitcoin transaction code messages and certain software or wasn't that would, uh, al qaeda was doing.

Speaker 2:          02:00:13       They were sending pictures and inside the actual digital image, the ones and zeros, there were encoding actual information that you could read and you can embed data differences. You can't execute that data because this thing will not execute the data it receives in the transaction. It simply runs a fingerprint function on it and signs it. So yes, the point of this is that jamie's incredulous look at them. Yeah. Seems like it's, you're setting a rule that's going to be broken in a month. Like, yeah, I can't do it today, but next week we figured it out and now we're, well, I, you know, I've had this device now for three years. Um, this is one of the first additions. Um, I, I keep my bitcoin on there, um, and I haven't had a problem yet. I don't put my money on exchanges. I keep it on devices like this, which is why I haven't had low money stolen.

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       The point of this is not to make it more secure, although it does, it's to make security easy for someone who's not technical. I could create a whole elaborate system as security experts to secure my bitcoins. That was never a problem. The point of this devices that you can secure your bitcoin, my mum could insecure her bitcoin without really knowing how, but just simply following how this works. So it takes security packages, attendant device and simplifies it dramatically. Um, that kind of thing. Here's the other question you asked me. What happens if someone points a gun at you? Right? We call that the $5 wrench solution. It's like, should we build a $10,000 super. It's, it's from a cartoon by randall monroe and xkcd says, should we build a 10,000 supercomputer to crack his encryption? Um, no. Here's a $5 wrench. Just beat him until he tells you what the password is.

Speaker 2:          02:02:08       Um, so resistance to that is difficult, but one of the things that these devices have in an all the systems in bitcoin have is duress passwords. So you can put a small amount of bitcoin in a specific accounts that opens with a different password and so shouldn't know so that people know, get the mother fucker. You gave me the duress password. Yeah, but they don't know which one is which. And this is a well known technique and we absolutely recommend using that as part of it. Listen, when I go to a country, uh, where security isn't as good, right? I carry my cash in a money belt or leave it back at the hotel in a safe. But I also carry a bundle of notes, high value notes like the equivalent of say, $50 here in the United States in my front pocket. And if somebody comes at me, pulls out a knife and says, give me your money, I will hand them my phone is a throwaway cash.

Speaker 2:          02:03:12       I haven't in my front pocket. And I will walk away from that. Listen to this podcast, they're going to know this motherfucker as a belt. And that's real ludas. There you go. That's it. So I mean this is something a lot of people do, right? Yeah, I'm sure. And that's why roberts are aware of it. Yeah. But for the most part they'll take the cash that you hand them in runaway probably. Yeah. Yeah. I can't help thinking like, although these little devices that you're storing your bitcoin on look elegant in 2016, I can't help thinking that they're just going to be like those gordon gekko giant brick phones when he was walking around the beach looking like a pimp from wall street. Remember that movie that they are, that they're like, he's holding that big ass. They are, that people will be watching this show, you know, a decade from now laughing at laughing at those things.

Speaker 2:          02:03:57       And that's fine. Because guess what, I, I just found a photo yesterday. I was looking through some of my files. I just found a photo of me. Yes, thank you. Look at him like a pimp with that big stupid phone. I found a photo of me on the 1991 with a leather, a side carrier with one of those in that holster, right? One of those brick phones. I think it was second generation. Motorola was about this big document, like ruin your hip. Like all that weight. Okay. That. Yeah, I was, I was uh, I was a sophomore in college. It's like 1991 first cell phone. So just come out. I'm in computer science. I'm a geek. I love gadgets. So I go by one of the first cell phones. It cost me an arm and a leg. I paid like $5 a minute to make calls on it. It's like $2,000, right? I think I paid something like 750 pounds sterling at the time. It's probably about a thousand bucks for a thing like this. Who's battery lasted an hour.

Speaker 2:          02:05:03       Batteries. Just so terrible. I've got a fantastic photo of me with the leather holster with that. My and I looked so cool. Can I see it? No, I don't have it with me. You don't have a physical photo somewhere. I actually found the physical photo. I haven't digitized them yet. When you do, please send it my way. I will. Absolutely. It was straight up on instagram. I also have poofy hair in the front and I'm wearing a ridiculous shirt. You were pimpin 1991. Nineteen 90 nature college. Yeah, I understand. I understand. So yeah, it will look ridiculous. But the point that you make so well is that we did go from gordon gecko to the right and and we're going to do that again in the bitcoin technology. This isn't something that's standing still. The amount of innovation that's happening today, even though it's not mainstream yet, is staggering.

Speaker 2:          02:05:56       I work in this space full time. All I do is read about what is new in bitcoin and that's a full time job. How many people are there like you? Are you the only one like this? No, no. Absolutely not. The only one who's this integrated. No, absolutely not. There a bunch of people like you. Yeah. There's probably about a thousand people like you who are doing this. Yeah. Who were living off bitcoin constantly investigating big corn, reading about it all the time. Lecturing and writing books about bitcoin. Well, not so many lecturing and writing books about it or speaking of conferences, but there's 100 to 200 who are doing that too. Yes. One hundred to 200. Yeah. Maybe you should talk to the other 199. Maybe they make better guests out there. You know, I, there's, I, I'm not claiming any special mental here. There's lots of people who are very much into it as I am and it is a full time job and because so much is happening.

Speaker 2:          02:06:51       So yes, you're right. These devices will seem antiquated. What this shows, however, is that when I came on the show the first time, I think about three years ago, um, I didn't yet have one of these and I used to store my bitcoin on what was called a paper wallet, which is basically where I print out the digital keys with a convoluted process to make sure my computer that's doing the printing isn't compromised because then they're compromised and then send the money to those digital keys and then put those in a vault in a safe deposit box in a, in a safe. And that worked great for two years. I kept a small amount of bitcoin safe that way. Problem is, it took a lot of expertise to execute on that. And there were many ways to get it wrong. So we've progressed. Now the way you back this up, as you write down 24 english words, like how hard is that?

Speaker 2:          02:07:47       That it shows to you one at a time on the screen and it tells you, write them down a runs with software in a website which has really three or four buttons. It's fairly easy to use. The device itself has two buttons. I could probably teach my mom how to use this and she owns bitcoin so that would be useful. But. And she owns one of these but it's still not ready. She probably only use it when you're around. Yeah. No, she doesn't use it or get out my little goofy fucking bitcoin thing. Let me pretend I use this for a. She wouldn't humor me that way. No, no, no. So, um, the bottom line is that five years from now this is going to be even simpler and we keep iterating and maturing of the technology. It's not standing still. And as it gets easier and easier, more people come on board.

Speaker 2:          02:08:38       Not only are they able to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but they're able to do it with security in a way that doesn't require an enormous amount of expertise. And this is the same. This happened with the internet. I remember this fantastic show you see in 1994 and they've got good morning America and there's this clip from the outtakes they're doing before they're doing this big internet story. And they have the host chatting amongst themselves before they started story and one of them saying, so what is the intranet? Is that the um, email? No, no, no, no. That's just email. So the outside is the internet. No, no, no, no. The outside is email. It's the www. That's, that's intranet and dotcom. That's internet. And it's going through this process where they're trying to grasp this alien and strange seeming technology and all of the terminology is weird. Let's play this.

Speaker 4:          02:09:38       As I was doing that little tease with the a and then the ring around it. So that's what I said. I'm katie said she thought it was about, but I've never heard of. Never heard of mark but never heard it said. And then it sounded stupid what I said and violence at nbc in the lunch room. So there is violence@nbcg.com. I mean alison should know what that is. That massive computer network. The one that's becoming really big now. What do you mean you. How does one know? What are you right to it? Like male, now a lot of people use it and communicate it. I guess they can communicate with nbc writers and producers. Allison, can you explain what internet is? She can't say anything in 10 seconds or less. Alison will be in the studio shortly. What? What does that mean? A giant computer network made up, made up of a startup from. Tell us what this was. It's not an. It's. It's. It's a computer billboard, but it's wide and it's several universities and everything all joined together and others could access it and it's getting bigger and bigger role. Just correct it during the quake. A lot of people, that's how they were communicating out to tell family and loved ones. They were okay because all the phone lines were down and I was telling katie taught me, you don't need that. You don't need to fall in line to operate. No,

Speaker 3:          02:11:04       so can you show this? That's awesome. If you show this to a millennial right now, they're like, oh, 94. That was just before the civil war, right? This is 18. Is it 18? Ninety four. Slavery was legal, right. They had back then. It's like they can't even conceive of a time when the internet was just so completely impossible to understand. I feel very fortunate that I grew up without it and got to experience it in my twenties. I experienced it emerge and I was like, whoa, what is this? But it didn't really have the same sort of impact on my life that it has on the lives of young people today that are growing up with a word there. I mean, you look at kids today, you go to a store or go to the mall or something like that and they go to a restaurant, they're fucking glued to their phone.

Speaker 3:          02:11:52       They're glued. Yeah. Here comes the prediction. This generation, which is growing up right now, they'd never know a world without internet. They also never know a world without bitcoin. Now 15 to 18 years from now, none of them are going to get a driver's license because there will be no self driving cars. I need one wouldn't be fucking Montana where I could drive my own goddamn car hobby, a hobby. It will be a hobby and you'll pay $3,000 a month in insurance to drive your own car. How much? I think you'll see. That's where it's going to go. Come on. I don't know. Humans behind the wheel, grandpa. That sounds insane. Thousand dollars a month didn't. So you're, you're going to be telling your grandchildren. Yeah. We use to drive our own cars. They say that sounds crazy. Did hundreds of thousands of people die every year?

Speaker 3:          02:12:45       Yeah, but we live like men. We didn't live in this digital dick. Like all these other pussies out there. Yeah, there you go. But think about it this way. Imagine a child born today that never sees cash. No. Unless they traveled to another country where they're backwards and they still use paper as money, right? Yeah. It's entirely possible. So what seems inconceivable to us then becomes the norm. Then it becomes inconceivable to live without it. Right. And then you're trying to explain, you know, so what consensus algorithm did the federal reserve use? Oh, it's used the 12 white dudes decide for you consensus. What is a

Speaker 2:          02:13:31       proof of work algorithm? No, no johnny, it was a proof of war algorithm backed by oil.

Speaker 1:          02:13:38       I am happy you exist. I love having you on the show. I love talking to. I love the fact that you have this beautiful vision of digital currency and if it works, if you're correct and it all pans out, I think it's going to be amazing. I love that. You know so much about it. I love you. Come on here and educate us. I love that every time you come on there really does seem to be more and more progress. It is tangible. It's trackable. It's interesting and it's fascinating and I'm all in. I'm on team bitcoin. I'm 100 percent committed. I really wanted it to happen, but it's just one of those things, man. It's just entirely fascinating. And until it absolutely is here, like credit cards, like the car, like all the other things that you were describing that really didn't exist before and now exist almost primarily.

Speaker 1:          02:14:31       I mean, I think um, it's, it's, it's absolutely amazing and fascinating. And again, in a lot of ways it's a solution for the control that the federal government, the federal reserve, the bank's end, even politicians have over us today that can control, is slowly being eroded by the internet. Not even slowly, pretty rapidly being eroded by the internet even whenever control politicians used to have. It's not nearly as. It's not nearly as easy to hide. It's so much more transparent. It's so much easier to protest today. It's just a different realm. We're living in a different world and that world is happening incredibly rapidly from a I got on in 1994. You were on before then when it was like this really fragile, strange internet. I mean you were in the early days. I'm really fascinated to see what it's going to be like 20 years from now and I really do hope you're right.

Speaker 2:          02:15:29       Well, that's one of the beautiful things about this is I think if you've experienced things like this before, and we're very lucky to be part of a generation where we have advancements in technology happening at a rate where you don't just see one or two, but you see several in a lifetime, right? That are pretty earth shattering in their complexity and involvement. We've seen the internet, we've seen social media, we've seen the miniaturization of computers. Now we're going to see self driving cars and digital currencies and all of these other things in a single lifetime. Once you've seen two or three of these, you start capturing the pattern and the pattern is when it starts, everybody ignores it, makes fun of it. Can't possibly see how change would happen. Right? Um, and this happened with the automobile that happened with electricity. It happens with credit cards. The first time credit cards

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       were introduced. Nobody thought they were going to work is a crazy, stupid experiments nobody wanted to take them. This happens with every type of technology. It's ridiculed at first, and then gradually it matures, it gets less cumbersome to use. And if it has some, some fundamental properties, some utility, something that's useful for that's different, that's new, that you can do things with it you couldn't do before, then at some point it hits an inflection point and it becomes mainstream very, very rapidly. And then everybody is both surprised and at the same time claims ownership and say, well, I always thought that this bitcoin thing would succeed. Well, let's hope we're those people. Um, this book is available right now. The internet of money. Where can people get it other than some funky exchange in some dark web corner of the world? Where can people get this?

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       Yeah. So this is available on an obscure side called amazon. Thoughts on that fucking one. Yes, it's, it's also available. Uh, it's going to book booksellers, worldwide's and amazon worldwide. It's available on kindle, kindle unlimited kindle lending library. If you buy the print, you get the kindle version for free. It's available for sale for bitcoin. And uh, yeah, it's out now actually. Um, it doesn't have any pictures in it. What's up with that? It does not have any pictures in it. I have a giveaway for five copies of the kindle edition in five copies of the print edition. Um, people don't have to purchase anything. They sign up, they follow me on twitter and they have a one in 100 chance of winning a free book. So if they want to try that, uh, jamie here has the links, maybe they can go in the show notes and people can try and get that giveaway. Is there something you could say over the air of the kingdom beyond that? I'll put it in the info on youtube info on youtube. Okay. Alright folks. Uh, thank you very much andreas. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. I hope you're right. I really do. And the internet of money is available right now. Yes. Right now I have copied number one. You fucks right here in my greasy hands. Thank you, sir. Always a pleasure. Thanks for having me.
