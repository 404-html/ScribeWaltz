Speaker 1:          00:00:03       What this episode is. Ladies and gentlemen, if you, if you tune into this podcast, he go, oh, I'm going to elicit to an intellectual discussion. This is going to be fascinating. No, this is four guys sitting around watching the UFC and we might get drunk. Okay. Brendan Schaub is here. Brian Cowan is here. Aubrey Marcus is here and I'm here. And what we did, we decided to do is while the fights are going on, we're in my podcast studio. We figured, fuck it man. Let's watch the fights with friends. Have a good time. Have a cookbook. Gag Dale's a couple of adult beverages. I brought some 2003 Bordeaux. Did you really? Where is it? I'll put it into my class. I don't want a real glass. Well, you'll learn. Oh, you, they call me the aristocratic for a reason. Anyway, so if you look in for a regular podcast with skip, oh look, I've got a million of them, but this ain't one of them. This may not ever happen again, but it's happening right now. Uh, shop and Cowan and I talked about doing this for awhile. Aubrey just happens to be in town right now.

Email it to me so I can email to RB. Oh yeah, I'll get right on the [inaudible]. [inaudible] it's so hard to email people and it's almost impossible. One piece of writing for my best little yellow pad that just want to do kettlebell workout. Right? He doesn't care about mine.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Piece of paper. You should have seen Brian trying to pull back a 90 pound bow the other day. He told me

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       things have ever seen. He tells me it's all in tech. It's all in the technique. Oh yeah. I saw that technique of lifting weights for many years, so shut up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       I wasn't warmed up. It was so sad. My back. Anyway, he needs kettlebells. Aubrey, he needs a lot of things, but kettlebells are also on the man. I don't know if he wants one.

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       Yeah, I want the Chevy doesn't want no man. Maybe if he has it earlier today,

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       the, the, the main fights cost of was good fight versus Lauren's locker. That's the combien. Uh, Eric Koch is a, is fighting on this car as well. Let me pull it up on ufc.com which a ufc.com is a very good website, but the UFC app, boy does that suck a fat one. That is a fucking terrible app. Whoever made that APP, how dare you call positive a very, that's a very good fight. Eric Koch versus Dan Crookshanks. Very good fight and Cruickshank, who's, who's his last opponent, he's so fun to watch. Oh yeah, no shit man. Darren is a, he's a taekwondo taekwondo guy. Originally. He's got wild ass fucking kicks, but he's also like putting together the rest of his game. Now you might have the best nickname in sports. What is it? Detroit superstar was a little long. No, it's dope. They should be shorter.

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       Creepy takes it from me. That's pretty good. A little creepy. That Detroit superstar. It's not a buy my name be. If I was a fighter, Brian, the irritable, irritable, he wouldn't, when he doesn't eat, he gets grumpy. Callen you really wouldn't have a nickname. No. No. What do you mean I have, I need a nickname. You'd be the kid need Brian. Brendan Schaub gala. Mike Rio was the, the last fight. God Damn, that was a good fight. She's the Mike Rio Fight. Uh, Darrin Cruickshank was on fire. Kicks, right. He's laying a lot of kids whose land and everything. He just looked sensational and coke's a bad mother fucker. Dude. You know coke is a, he's a very talented kid. I mean he lost to a poor. Yay. But then he came back and beat Hafi Elo. Oliveira he lost too, right? He lasted a poor. Yay. And then he lost.

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       Lost Him. Ricardo Lamas back to back. Yeah, but too tough fucking guys. Two really tough guys. Why did you pour this in the glass? You made sure you poured it in glass. Well, it tastes better in a glass coffee mug. The, the, the blue. Shut up. Shut your mouth, bring it to your nose. Shut your fucking mouth. Take it into your mouth. Hey, next year, see Eddie, Eddie Wineland lost today. I know. Got knocked up by this kid who was caught in two years. First round. I believe it was the second round. I think he's the end of the first. Could am I crazy? It might've been. I was watching it while I was working out. So you might be, who is the guy lost to? Uh, I'll tell you right now. I have a computer, but a Wineland. I mean, coming off of a title fight, right.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       You know, uh, it comes off of that fight. Then look sensational in his next fight. He fights. I'm just get caught. He fought eve job, Wayne and stopped him and looked fucking sensational. Not well. He fights in a weird way. He Wineland keeps his, never lifts his hands above his nipples. Aggressive too. Super aggressive, super strong. And he's a really good fighter. He moves his head a lot. He's got a lot of faints and he gets away with it. And the punches come from all kinds of crazy angles because his hands are low, but that's never a good style. It's just never a good stock. Keep your fucking hands low is never good. And this kid correct him. Johnny Eduardo cracked him with the right hand and the first round. Um, yeah, you were right. Round one, four minutes, 37 seconds in Brown one caught him with a right hand earlier in the round and then stunned him with one for about four minutes 20 in and then followed up with another one and dropped him in his legs.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Just completely gave out. He's always that guy who is one away from the title just in that weight class. He's always, he's always right there, especially when he's there coming off that eve job wave five where he looked close fucking sensation and Jill boys up, bad motherfucker dude, that was, that was a really good fight. And Eddie what? What rank number four? I think so it's close number four when exactly. He's number four. He takes his fight against an unheralded guy who hasn't fought in over two years. This kid hadn't fought in. I think it was something crazy, like 700 days. God said,

Speaker 3:          00:06:11       God a man top. That's where it doesn't pay to take fights.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Yeah, you're right. You're right. Well, a lot of guys sit down and people give him a hard time and they said, Ooh, fighters fight. But

Speaker 3:          00:06:24       man, it's a business. You should have a manager. Listen, UFC Austin a fight. I take it. But at the same time too, you want to fight the highest rank guy, the most famous guy possible. That's all anyone cares about me. And the highest rate guy who'd ever turned down. Have you ever turned down and why? Um, man, the only fight I ever turned down, it was once, I don't remember his name. He a huge guy. A grappler. Abu Dhabi fight, peewee Herman. Last few Herman fight of the night. You know, I'm talking about, but he retired enormous dude.

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       MMM. God dammit. Okay, let's Dave Herman

Speaker 3:          00:07:02       pull it up. The Rock. He really sweats a lot. Is that the guy? Okay, I sweats. Last guy who sweats a lot, man, I forget his name. God super muscular. And My, my, my manager called me and uh, with the fight and I was like, uh, oh, John, olive, Imo, Imo, Imo. So they called me the fight and uh, I just got off fight Nogueira so I'm not going to go no gear. I know, right? I was just like, no man, not happening. And uh, my manager's like, well, let's see what they come with. I said, all right, well if it's a do or die, I'll take it. Let's do it. I'll destroy this guy. And then they came up with a different opponent, came up with Rothwell, but that's the only fight where I was like, ah, I don't think so man.

Speaker 1:          00:07:44       Right. Yeah. The only time, yeah. It's a tricky thing, right? Like when you, you want to take a fight if you're, you know, if you need a fight, if you need the money, you want to take a fine. But if you're in a situation where they offer you something dangerous on two weeks notice, yes. Like sometimes cards fall apart and they try to pull that car together. Like they're making a bunch of calls this week to try to get someone to fight Vitorin Brazil because junior dos Santos just broke his hand. Junior dos Santos was supposed to fight Steve Bay chick, he broke his hand. Um, they had meo chick is now gone. Fabulous Maldonado who is at two oh five or who's fan at two oh five true. You know, and now he's stepping up to fight heavyweight and Steve Bay Myoshia cause a top 10 guy. So it's a, it's kind of a crazy matchup that probably wouldn't be approved in the state.

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       I agree. And I also heard that you can get your money back. Oh wait. Why would, why wouldn't that fight the, are you sure? I heard the states like what? There's actual five or fighting a top 10 heavyweight as a commissioner that

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       says that's just too much of a mismatch. Well not even a two oh five or two or five or that's been zombied you know, I mean, he's been beaten senseless by a bunch of guys. He's a tough mother. Fucks as tough as they come. Fabio Maldonado

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       is so tough that you got to watch out for him if he fights a big guy because he's got to go, God, this guy takes so much punishment. He's so fucking tough. You've got to almost protect them from the other end though. I can see cause Steve Bay has in the past don't you rung because he is a beast. Used to be a trading part in mine. Super Freak to athlete to monster. However, when he fought strew if he kind of gassed out and got knocked out, correct. Yeah. Now in this fight, you know what I mean? The cardio, it could be an issue. And uh, Fairview auto boxing is really, really good. Yes. He's got the most rabid fans in the world driving him. That's true. We watched him in Brazil and they'd go crazy for five year. Well Maldonado was just as tough as the heroes. Toughest. Fuck man. He's, and he's probably one of the best body punches in this sport. My concern would just be the size, just the sheer size difference. What is Tbi? Walk around at two 30. So who this right now, who's fighting right now, and Jane will give us some volume so we can at least hear it. Hearing it is fine. Chris Kerry Yasso and who is he fighting? They'll give us some volume.

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       Bruce buffer with the official introduction. Yeah, and

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       that's the coolest. The coolest fucking thing is watching Bruce buffer introduced fighters in Brazil because everybody together goes, it's really 2000 people will be doing it in sync. No Way. Oh, it's amazing. It's one of the coolest things ever is actually great. He's got that great voice. Ooh. Bruce buffers the bat. He really is the best, the best Bruce buffer. I've seen him at Gold's gym. I work out there in the off season. I saw him in Gold's gym on the cable machine doing the Bruce. What was it? The one 80 turn though? No, it works it out. You worked it out and so explosive. I didn't see him and I'm walking through the gym. I hear [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       I was so embarrassed. Oh, that's funny. He's good though. He doesn't take, he doesn't have a a card with them or anything. He just remembers it all. That's not true at all. He has a card constantly. Shit, what are you talking about? He reads off the cards. He throws the cards in the ground when he's done. Good Jack Ass. Get your facts right. I was talking about the rock again. Shit. By the way, all you can't. They get mad at me for giving Brian a hard time. Do you know what? I'd love this motherfucker like a brother and I would give them a hard time if it was a podcast or no pot. That's how friends hang with. He took a sensitive for me. Thank you everybody. Thank you. A marathon by the way. He'll do that to me too. Okay. That's what friends are all about.

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       It's not in the podcast. Joe Rogan, I just don't have as many weaknesses as him, so it's more difficult to find holes. That's openings, but if he finds holes in my game, he will chip at them. One of the things that friends are for, I liked the USA keep each other honest. We've got a good friend keeps sending to jump on board. What's that? USA judo jumping on board. Just restaurants or shun? Well USA recipe for what? Yeah, it is. You'll see wrestles beings and I feel like when you kick to the body with your, with the top guys are fighting. No, it did say that last thing. I want to fight with them. When you kicked your butt, when you kick to the body, when the top of your foot, I always feel like that's so risky because you could break the top of your foot.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       So we shut the fuck man. We're talking taekwondo. Not well. You know I broke the top of my foot many times on elbows. Yeah, that's what you gotta be. You gotta be scared. But look, obviously you could break your fucking shins, your mind, everything lightening fast. Cause I go, I go up and then I can't, you see Tyrone Spong brings lay against fucking bill con Saki. Holy Shit. No, I didn't see. It's weird seeing a high level kickboxer do that. It's a super rare. I agree. But to me it's surprising that not more guys break their legs. It is, well, it's weird. There's like this rash of broken legs. You know, Anderson Silva, Tyrone Spong civil last week looking pretty good, moving pretty good. Well, Tyrone Spong is only four weeks out. I think he's already walking. He's walking on a treadmill. No CAS, no nothing. They've got a bolt in there.

Speaker 2:          00:12:57       When you, what, what they do now back in the day when you break your Femur, I'll break your bone in half like that. They would keep you off it. What they do now is within 12 hours, 24 hours, they tried to get you walking on it immediately. And the reason for that, they'll set it and have you actually start putting pressure on it because to the Bot, what they found is it you heal faster because your body rushes calcium to that part of the bone and that weird, that is weird. Within 12 hours, 12 hours, 12 hours. Like if you were walking on a broken leg and 12 obviously you don't put, yeah, you don't put a lot of, you don't put a lot of pressure, but when they break their femur skiers, they got those guys in their feet as soon as possible because apparently you know the, you, you heal much faster.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       Wow. Yeah. So Carrie also is a, he's a wild mother fucker man. I love watching their kid fight too. And now that he's dead, this is one 25 right? These guys are fighting at one 25 or are they not a fly wakes 25 cause he fought at one 35 for the longest time and he was kind of undersized. I'm glad they have that. They're, you know, they're thinking about doing a straw weight. A one 15 for guys and for women's. Obviously they are. But for guys there Straw weight, man, that is a small dude. That's right. That would be such a nightmare to fight that guy because he'd probably still win and he's so respectful. I box with that Guy Wayne McCullough. He light you up. I know him. You kidding me? Worst thing ever. It just takes so much longer. One 19. Oh, what's like Ken and Floy and you see Kenny flew into a bar, probably going to pick on it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       Yeah, I'll let it says dresses like a hipster, although he's hitting the baddest dudes on the planet. But both my head and your head would fit in Kenny's head. He's got a giant head, big head, huge head. When I first saw him in person, I went, that can't be Kenny Florida. And that's the biggest head I've ever seen on that gentleman. And uh, I wonder if there's a real direct correlation between taking a punch and having a big head. I always joke around about it and talk about it in podcasts. Well, boxing boxing trainers thing, Emmanuel Steward said that they look for when, when trainers looking for boxers, they look for a wide face and a short neck. We'll look at David [inaudible] who took a punch better than that Guy

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       [inaudible] Nelson mark on Roy Nelson. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's some guys that just like Tommy Hearns always had a hard time taking a punch. Just has that narrow face. And there's nothing you can do about that. Just it is what it is. You want to talk about a guy spinning? So I'm fucking wars. Tommy Hearns. I was watching some Tommy Hearns fight. The other guy on Youtube, a couple when he knocked out Duran Dude, he knocked around and he was and he was and he fought at 47 which I can't believe. Yeah, well he fought as high as a light heavyweight. I believe he went all the loss to Iran. Barkley. I think that was at one 68 I'm not sure. You know what's interesting about this fight is a, usually you have to have, so for instance, homeboy on the cages, red shorts, car Yasso. Yes. And the other guy is black and red shorts.

Speaker 3:          00:15:42       Both similar shorts usually have to be complete opposite shorts. They force you to do that. Yeah. It's just the bottom of the trim though. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? You think? I think it go cut. This guy, the guy, um, what's Carrie asked? Mocha Curiosa. No, he's a morning Thai guy. Caught on using that term is try to dope dope response. First of all your word. Don't let Rhonda tell him some moves. She my favorite word though. How are we go? She is, Oh shit. Oh it's tight. Oh nope. Lost the position. But I'll let go of that. Getting a lot of guys who've been catching that von flue choke. Yeah man. Cause they hang on the routine. Look at this. He gets forward again. It does not under the Chin though. He's just a that crank and I'm, yeah. Nice. Oh Nice fish. Then the round scrappy, crappy end of the round lolly guys hang onto that key.

Speaker 3:          00:16:30       A teen and then all the guys doing is taking them down. Pass the side control and you can't get your glove out. You know what I'm saying? Can't you? Your glove out. So then you have a choke there. You just ramming your shoulder into the artery and the, yeah, they can't get it out. It's called the von flue choke. That's what, uh, everybody calls it because someone just had a big finish with that recently. Now OSP crew. Yeah. Opens saying against Al Capone, a guy who was fighting and heavyweight most of his career, really undersized. A smallest heavyweights ever. Yeah. He's fighting a Cody Donovan in Dublin. Now I OSP is a no, a alcopop two oh five hmm. Interesting that that von flue choke. You very rarely see in Jujitsu though. That's what's interesting about that. Jitsu guys don't a good GC guys not gonna hang onto that.

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       Yeah, he's just not, it's true. They're not going to waste the energy. High level juice guys don't go waste his energy on it's up. The guy was kind of panicking in a fight and a fight gets taken down and doesn't want the guy to posture, so he holds onto the gay thing and then when your gloves caught in there, you're screwed. Man. It's a lot of pressure. I mean, I'm sure you felt it. You know, with a glove on. It's a different story when you're stuck. It's like, Dang. Yeah. When a guy really knows how to put that weight on it too, he's got a good side control and knows how to pin you down. Put forced that shoulder and your neck or yeah, you'd to sleep. Some guys

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       can fuck you up. Just head arm control when they're passing your card, like there's different kinds of pressure. It's like his wrestler pressure. There's some guys straight on top of you. They just, they know how to put all their weight on a very small point like this. Some guys who get side control on you, but they're like laying on their knees and even if they're cy controls solid. If you can't get out of it, you're not hurting, you're not in pain. And then there's other motherfuckers that we'll have all of their weight unlike the left side of their chest and they'll like put side control on you. Just

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       where do you like a collage of science? Yeah, it really is. It's a balance. I'm still working on it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       It's hard, man. It's hard. It's interesting because I have like a nasty twister side control on, on the right side, but then when I do it on the left side, it feels alien because I never go to it on the left side of some positions like that. It's, we're, we would think that this is a position I know in my head inside and now it's not that complex a position, but on the right side, Bam. It's like, I'll fuck, it's like a clamp bank. It's like locked in place. But on the, on the other side I'm like moving too much and I'm slippery.

Speaker 2:          00:18:53       It was, people could see Joe because he's actually moving around in his chair wiggle. I'm a wiggler. He's a wiggle in this corner. No wiggle. I'm a wiggler Brian, Kaitlyn and Brian Callen number. We, are you ever going to go back to Jujitsu? Um, I think I'd like to talk about on the ride down and I miss it a lot and then he goes, well everyone has nick problems who does Jujitsu. That is true. A lot of people do. You're a big guy. Yeah, it's the real problem is rolling with big guys. Don't roll big guys stacked. Getting stacked is a big problem and exploding, trying to explode from the bottom. A lot of times guys get injured doing that bridge. Going to be smart. Brian, you're not trying to win Abu Dhabi. Just grapple with girls. Only when, when? When Brian and I first met each other, I brought him to Carlson Gracie's and he started working out with Sergio Cohen.

Speaker 2:          00:19:39       It was one of Carlson Gracie's black belts and he like grabbed Sergio's neck. Well because I was grabbed his neck, like Claude is never going into a Sergio headbutted him and his nose and broke his nose and just smushed him like a bug because I was actually, I went in there like thinking as a wrestler I was going to take these, I was taking like people down because they've, they don't care about that may limit. Let me clarify, this is not what happened. He, he just got aggressive and Douchey with a guy who was a big juiced up crossing gate. That guy, I mean he's a big guy to play to watch that. Yeah. I didn't have any respect cause I thought out this is the wrestling bad wrestling. I didn't know where that meat head, who's going all hard. I was just taking, I would like they'd white belts and they're like blue belts.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       Who'd never done any rustling, so I'd be taking them down and then I go third year. Who Decides to go, let's, let's do some you want to take, you want to go take downs? And he grabs me and I was like, oh well that's a bear. And it was so much bigger than him. Okay, now we're back. We're back to Fox sports one. Everybody, the fights were on Fox sports too. And then what happened? The the base guy handles over. So we'll get back to you. We'll get back to my fighting. That bullshit baseball game. What was it? Nine. Nothing forces us to baseball. If they invented baseball today, people would spit in your face and we tried to sell it. I agree. If you try to pitch and given one bill, why I got a gain, it'd be could take forever. It's like fucking like cricket.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       Imagine trying to pitch cricket. Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why is he throwing the ball like that? What is he doing? Why does he have a pet? Your arm is your arm on? He has a paddle wheel. The guy has a paddle. And why is this game lasting three days? You can read the fucking guy is nick it and make it go backwards. And where is the game? Last three days. No satisfaction. Even if you whacked the ball hard. And guess what? In baseball, if you hit the ball three out of 10 times, you're in the hall of fame. Yup. Three out of 10 guess what? In the UFC, when three out of 10 flights, you don't know, three out of 10 10 cracks him with a nice left car. Yasso throws a very deceptive head kick to he. He hides his head kicks. Well he'll sneak him over the outside of the shoulders like the right outside, right over the Jag.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       It's fucking Deontay wilder. Yes. Beat the fuck Internet troll classic. The guy he fought, first of all, that guy who the troll is insane. Like clinically, something's wrong with him. Like he's like bipolar or something. I want him to knock the troll out like really bad. The troll had me laughing because it took a shot during the gym and he takes a shot and hit some of the body and then they're like, break it up and then the troll just goes, got you to the body, bro. Hit you, hit you the body man body, and they went back at it and while they're crushed him, smashed him, got him on the ground, dropped him, hit him when he was down. He still like hit you in the body. I hate that. Made me laugh because I know he's going to sleep. He's got a power game going to sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:22:31       Oh, he's trying to get out of it. That's a good way to get out of it. Guys do get out of it that way. Just drop into their back. Wow. He got right there. That right there. That's how you hurt your neck. That is how I, my fucking neck has gotten hurt so many times because I didn't tap and I'm like, boom, fucking no Turpin I'm no to happen. Meanwhile, your neck is ruined for weeks if you just have that ego. I don't have that. If I'm going with another UFC heavyweight, if we're trained together, I'm not tapping and then not had enough that he got no. However, if I'm at the Gracie Academy up, man, I don't care. Do not. The idea is that you shouldn't have been in that position in the first place. You know how to learn from it. You're going to learn from it and UFC.

Speaker 2:          00:23:13       If you're a heavy weight, you have to be under to 60 right to 65 to 65 somebody was saying that there is a purpose, there is a, there is a number, there's a perfect way for a heavyweight, two 42 42 in other words, that's where the best guys seem to lie at [inaudible]. Even if you would let made the weight class 300 and you got a 300 pound guy, well the differences in boxing, in boxing, it's a little lighter because you don't get it got away on you. Like you have to deal with the fact that you're moving bodyweight around. Right? Like there's a different way like in boxing look at, in my opinion, Mike in his prime,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       the Mike Tyson of the early, the like the 85 Mike Tyson, that range. I think he's the greatest heavyweight of all time. That's my opinion. Just a lot of the people that have opinions, but I think the Mike Tyson, the destroyed Marvis Frazier, the Mike Tyson that knocked out Larry Holmes to 20 to 20 maybe two eight just Hauer mother fucking guys just motherfucking them. Yeah, but I don't think you could get away with that as a UFC fighter. I don't think in boxing, by the way, doesn't even have a fucking wait Mendez. He would have been what? Two S two too small to handle a big guy on top of them that they'll guy like Cain takes you down, lays on you and starts. You got a guy like big foot who's capturing 300 men. You're talking about a different game. It's always funny to me and granted, listen, cutting weight. I'm sure it's horrendous. I've cut from two 50 to 25 for Metamorris and it was tough, but not like these guys. You know, Bacon, one 55 one 45 but we'll be at the wanes and nothing drives me more crazy. Everyone goes, God wish I was a heavyweight. Everyone tells that English. How's everybody? Oh do you?

Speaker 3:          00:24:50       Oh really? That's cool. You're fighting a guy at one 55 right? That's cool. Because I weighed two 38 the guy I'm fighting to 65 I'm scared shitless. 25 pounds a lot of ways. A lot of weight. 25 25 almost 25 men. 25 with 16 ounce John Stacked on top each other. And then that drops on your head. Just that is that two weight classes pretty much. And there's, there's no other division like that and said there's nothing like that. This guy keeps giving his neck to carry off. So carry also on the bottom here. You're right. You know the, the shorts are confusing cause I just thought [inaudible] was on the bottom. I've never seen it this close. Usually Yossi doesn't play that game. You know, you're fighting a superstar if they're like, yeah, he got some black shorts. Oh, okay. Make you cool. Change the color of your shirt, you're wearing white. He's obviously when the Croatian flag black. Cool man. Nobody ever had to worry about that. With rich Franklin, he's got the pink shorts and you can have your Brown oh carrier Aso's mounted. Oh Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:25:53       Smokers on top of him. Did you guys see the Zak Cummings fight earlier tonight? No. Fucking incredible fighter and credible. What a fight. It was awesome. Yeah. And Cummings was the underdog and he wound up winning. I don't think mount is a dangerous positions. Everyone thinks as it's notoriously known for. What do you think of that, Joe? Um, I think in MMA the, the problem with the mount is when you go to rain down punches, you give up space. And when you give up space, guys put their hands on your hips and they pop softly. Like people think when you get to mount, like, oh no, it's over now. Especially if a guy knows what he's doing, depending on the mound posture. But, but if you're, if you have your hooks in, you control them, you're not going to go to punches hard. Well, some guys have a nasty Malik Benevidez has a wicked mount because he does, he does a guard from the mount.

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       I love that position. And when, uh, when you Mount Guy and you cross your feet underneath his body, you can constrict him the same way you can with a guard and Benevidez if he gets a, uh, an arm anywhere near your chin, his gay teen game is so strong as, as your, I favors as his cello Mendez. All the teen guys are ridiculous when they get unit. I'm just saying as far as taking punishing them, if you have a decent amount, dark defense guys are evenly matched. Scramble. This is a great Jujitsu match actually. Yeah. There used to be a time where mouth or like back mount was game over. People got used to that. It's like for like five years. Is that all you've got his back. It's a similar thing. Like so gets a mountain even in even a camp right now. So I want to get to mountain was like, oh no.

Speaker 3:          00:27:28       And I was like, well do you remember when big of a deal rem co Pardot fought Marco who was Marco who has mounted him and he tapped sheer terror. You've got the mountain. He's like, he says over the position is no Gui. You know what one guy where if he got mount it was actually over and you should tap shank Carlin. Oh yeah, that's a good point. And it's like having a building on it didn't matter how good your Jujitsu, we haven't a building on you, but Brock Lesnar survived it. Otherwise Way Shankar strong. Scott Bardelli any postured up Dan Carlin's strongest guy you've ever, ever rolled with? Yes. I mean he's like, he's like an alien from a muscle planet. You don't want to say it's like, Oh did you come from muscle planet? That fucking guy was so big and his arms were so long to get my car and cry man.

Speaker 3:          00:28:20       After practice you'd think you'd be getting better. Cause he takes like a week off cause he just didn't give a shit. Yeah. And then I'd beat, you know, in the gym and electric in the gym seven days a week he'd come in and just what my ass now when he got injured, you know, like what, how, how much did his injuries progress and how did they progress? Cause I know he had a lot of back injuries, back injuries, then they had a horrible neck and it was like, like when he fought Frank Mir, he might've hit myths three times. He just couldn't do it. Wow. We just got fucked up when, when Shane, Colin flat, Gabriel Gonzaga, that was like his very first big test and he knocked them out with like, uh, like this. He just went boom and knock Gabriel's and after you got tagged and he got his nose broken.

Speaker 3:          00:28:57       Exactly. But, uh, when Shane was getting me for that fight and I've seen a ton of fighters, man, my time a ton, the best in the world, that was the best heavyweight and I've ever seen in my life. She was about two 55 sure. Ratted. It looked like you shaved a silverback gorilla and put boxing gloves on them. And I had to be his main training. I like, I had to give myself a pep talk in the car. I was talking myself up like, you can do this bro, just get, just get through it. Yeah. But I, I've never, his speed, his quickness, his cardio was good. He hit so hard and they'd be like, Hey, we got other guys for Shane today. I'm like, thank God cause I don't have to go one round with them. These other guys would go in. I'd just sit back and like, you would knock everybody out, man.

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       In training, in training now. Did at grudge, was there too much of that going on at grudge? Uh, I would say yes. Big Smile before you answer, I would say. But you know what, that was the thing that like back then I think every gym was like that. Cause I go to for you knew better before you go down to Jackson's and all we would do is punch each other in the face. It's all we did. It's a weird thing because a lot, you know who criticizes a lot of that is um, Ernesto hoost or nuts. So who's who's talking about gyms that do that? And he was like, it's ridiculous. It's horrible because it's very, doesn't make you better. It's not necessary. It doesn't make you what's doing it. It's taken yet it's taken out potential fight of the nights. You could have getting paid a lot of money for it.

Speaker 3:          00:30:26       Like a on Friday. Um, it's spined at rain and there's a bunch of new guys. They're tough high level guys. And if they don't have headgear on, I won't smarm really nothing cause my head. But if we both can you cut my list, man, I got to fight in four weeks. Right. Beating you up does nothing for me. I don't get paid to do this. Well they, they were wondering why it's like that now I'll say something like, Nah Bro, get headgear, we'll do it. We'll go next round our role or something. Right. They did it really? And somebody was talking about how smart, when somebody gets knocked out five times or whatever and they start getting a glass chin, so you touch them, they go out. And what they were saying was that the reason for that was that your brain, when, when you, when you get caught, you're brain will shut off.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       It's so used to that. It goes, oh danger time, don't want any more punishment. Gotta protect itself and we'll shut your body right off. The Dell, Dell explained it to me. We were talking about at once and he said that he just couldn't take a shot anymore. What it was because he said he was, you know, he was, he would grit his fucking, it would bite down on his mouthpiece and cough it out and just absorb punishment. And his brain knew when he was getting hint that he was going to do that and his brain knew that he was gonna absorb punishment. So the is like, fuck you, I'm going to just shut off. That's good though. Yeah. So when I said somebody who can be the point of you and I'm telling the story again. All right, so that's right. Yeah. Johnny Hendricks came out pretty publicly and talked about how he didn't take head shots for that whole camp against Lawler.

Speaker 3:          00:31:49       Well it's smart. You see him in the cage there and those guys are just trading back and forth. Then you got to save it for when it counts you football, don't they? They're not going to see, they don't scrimmage like all these certain guys cause they're getting smarter. Like Michigan, Ohio state, they don't hit during the season. It makes in the NFL you really don't hit, you don't hit your paying these athletes so much money. Why the hell listen, if you can't take a punch now or void a pinch now, you're not going to do it four weeks from now. Exactly. That's a very good point. And your ability to take a punch a lot of times depends on how many punches you've already taken. I mean, we've all seen guys where they just, their chin starts to go. We've all seen guys like that where they just start to hit. Did you see Pat Barry's last fight? I did. Pat Barry had never gotten knocked out before. When he fought Chuck Congo, check Congo was the first time he ever went out. That was a great fight. It was a great fight. But then he got knocked out there. He got knocked

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       out by soul politely. He got knocked out by Lavard Johnson. He got knocked out and he got knocked out by this Zach Movie Casa. Holy Shit. Is that guy up to hell? What was that? That's the Congo son. That's a girl. Grew up in the fucking Congo. Congo. We we're talking about when we were talking about Russians, Russians are scared of people from the Congo cause that's some next level shit. Next level shows dudes who climbed, he's got silver backs in Russia, the wrestling, grizzly bears. Here I am in Malibu playing grab ass with Bruce Jenner. How the fuck am I going to do this, man? My kids are screwed. So I kick a Jaguar in the, I kick his shuck water, I DVR it. And when I got home, I fast forward to Pat Barry's fight in the dude. He was fighting. I was like, no, who signed this fight?

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       Why would you do that? Movie Casa has a, he's got a pretty good boxer boxing background. Yeah. And you know, I think it was 12 and one is a pro. I like Pat Barry. But I hate when a guy says I fight one round fights. So I fired one round fired some other. If I wonder if I stop, we stop saying that it's a mental week. Well not only that, like what do you, I understand that you want to be exciting. I understand that. But you're a fighter and you're skillful. You know that guy should be doing and he should be training at some high level camp, you know, some high level Moitai. Can you want to be a more anti fighter? Fucking go to Golden Glory MMA gym. Go Do. Yes, exactly. Go somewhere. You know how was the guy who had walked into wrestling and literally you'd be like, dude, just don't kill your dog on the way here. Or You'd get to watch wrestling and just be like super sad, super sad.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       The other heavyweight shop go with pat and like, all right, come here and Mopey Murdo let's go. Let's go. This is how you avoid hitting stuffed on your back. He just hated wrestling that much. Hate, dreaded it. He was gone. He was doing wrestling and was like, you know what? Fuck this. And then was like, I'm, I'm, I'm retiring. I don't wanna do this anymore. That's hilarious. Hear. I hear he's like a really funny guy. Like he's hilarious. He's a great guy, but for how much longer? How much longer? If he keeps getting knocked out like that, you know? That's what I worry about. I like that. It's a sweetheart. He's a great guy. He's tough as shit. He puts on exciting fights. I mean, when he knocked out the late, great, Shane del Rosario, that was like one, a, one of my favorite heavyweight fights ever. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       I'll take some more. You're not mad at this wine, by the way. Very. I'm not mad at this. Bulletproof coffee. The only reason I come, somebody is in camp. I swill line like an aristocrat. By the way, it's one of the reasons why he can't pull back in 90 pound ball. Your body's rejecting. It doesn't matter. I've got good taste buds. My buddies, I'm belt for dancing, elbows, whatever bullshit. Afterwards I can do 28 champs, which, okay, which is Peter, tell me how to tell me. He's like, I don't get it. You could do it so easy. You could do it easy. By the way, heavy weights. I was all bunched up. I was like, Huh? Heavyweights. How about pots was selling mouthpieces. That's how he got into the game. Sell mouthpieces, pots and sour politely. [inaudible] he's not, he's not Samoan isn't, how do you see he's a happy boy.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       His name Ruan pots. Let's put some volume here. Is He from Holland? Where's he from?

Speaker 4:          00:35:56       Heavyweight comes to the UFC. Haven't finished.

Speaker 1:          00:35:59       Let's back it up so we could see how John Annex says his name and then fast forward. So we're not out of line with all the people watching at home. So am I be besides big foot. The second biggest guy back it up again. What a bad ass. I wish I was. Simone,

Speaker 4:          00:36:16       you'll see on the back it up again and welcome to the big show.

Speaker 2:          00:36:24       Rule One. Alright,

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       for this shit. Where is Ron pots from? He lives next door to you,

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       your wife right now. Hey Man, I'll tell you. I'm not there to videotape it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:34       What is this? What is this? Why does Fox News insists on putting hot chicks in dresses that talk about sports? I'm not mad about it. I'm not mad about it either, but it makes me uncomfortable. My Dick gets hard, right?

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       I'm watching. I'm like, what are you doing? Are you sending me mixed mixes and had a big sweaty Samoan comes on the screen. You're like, oh no, I'm really confused. I disagree with your political outlook, but my dick is hard listening. Got a hard on. I want to argue with you and give you a better point than you're capable of making. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       Just so I can fuck. You can remember on a freak, your friends would just walk into the room with a heart on. Well that's what they're trying to do when they're putting these women on Fox News. I mean, look, not, not saying there's anything wrong with these women or that they're not intelligent. They surely are. That's how they got on you. Look, it's very difficult to get a job where you're a political correspondent or you're doing sports. I mean it's even harder for a woman to do sports and it's for our man, cause he's got to stand up to all the patriarchy, all the bullshit that guys don't want to hear women talking about sports.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       However, they're all hot. Like that's a, that's a fucking strategy. They know what they're doing and you tricking us. We can have large Marge up there and be like, let's just Wayne Wayne back that up real, oh, packed that up. I need to see this. There's no need for that. When you think about a boner,

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       so here's the commercial is all this Wayne Newton's spinning around.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       That might be a wow. Who's hot as fuck, by the way, is excited that we Newton still don't let it let it roll because Oh and look, she gets excited. No, she knows that. Oh Gee, you're not a good enough factor, ma'am. You're not a good enough factor for that to go to videos and face. Zombie did touch her pussy moist. No, he does not. He's a thousand years old. Yeah, and I know you want to get your sag card, but that's, there's better ways vampires. There's fucking better ways. [inaudible] who's able to wink? He had a fucking sweat. You doing squats. Weekend is like 40 pounds. The Botox. I bet he has so many bitches in Vegas. It's not even books ridiculous. He probably has so much money, so if he has so much money, of course he has so many bitches in case there's so many lost, confused people get these girls to the show seeing some little song.

Speaker 2:          00:38:59       I think at this point in his career it's probably done. I disagree. I disagree. He's performing at Hooters casino though. He is he. Okay, well let's find out where he is. Well, he might still be, believe it or not, either way and cause he's going, he's going back to the villain. Just haven't bitches. It's one of those things like Tony Bennett. Will you pretend it's good if Tony Bennett between the spearmint rhino or going to see Tony Bennett? Me, it. No, because I just feel like those girls, I feel sorry for them. Most of them are nursing students. Wayne newton.com schedule. Let's go to sketch. You guys want to get boners in the meantime or no? All right. Oh, okay. He might not even be in Vegas anymore because it says here he's in Nebraska, five 17 Lindenwood university. Yup. Casino Dude. He took, he took your shit on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not even defending Wayne Newton. You're a contrarian, but university is spelled wrong. It's you never city cit. Why that's not how you spell university isn't, well, if it's a university, Brian, who you got in this fight, heavyweight, Samoan on principal, Mr Las Vegas world tour and he's going to some university in Saint Charles, Missouri and then another place in Wisconsin, Lake Lake. Of the torches resort. Casino lock do Flom Bay, Wisconsin. Holy Shit. You know, he just, he wishes Hooters casino. Wow. He might not be in pain. This is really true. He really does. He still, he still calls himself Mister Vegas. I don't know. It's a good question man. It seems like he's not in Vegas anymore. That's insane. It's a shame. Really. So, Brendan, for the heavyweights, how much tougher is a heavyweights chin versus the punching power? Like what's that relation there?

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       You people ask me this all the time. I mean, besides Mark Hunt and Roy Nelson, there's really no such thing. Everyone's been knocked out at heavyweight. I mean name a guy, he's been knocked out. All the top guys have really been knocked out. So, and if you haven't, you're not finding tough enough guys. Yeah. So if you say from middleweight to heavyweight, how much more of a punch does it take? 20% 30% it's tough to say Tufts. It depends on the fighter. But like if a soul, it lands a good jab here, it could knock at that size of a jab, the size of his legs. So saw my God,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       Brian, please control, sorry. Sorry. It's a big boy. He's put your back straight. But I'm just saying so it was a big boards a hands, Huh? But he fought, he, he felt part of against Eddie Sanchez in his first fight in the UFC, just hardier adrenaline, adrenaline dump because Ryan Parsons was very high on this guy who was saying like, the guy's a beast. He just, he just had a hard time. He's light on a hard time dealing with the pressure. The pressure's a motherfucker, right. I mean, oh Brendan, you feel like the pressure was you sold on so yeah, exactly. Doing saying guys do that drives me nuts. But Paul, Ellie, his, he had his arm trapped, trapped. But if it wasn't, he would come over. But I bet he doesn't do that cause he's not a graph. No. Well, you know he did Mount, um, Pat Barry.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       Pat. Yes. So did my brother. But he did work with a lot of wrestlers. He did work with a raw. So it did. So look at this. This guy's using this gay teens to, he's using. Can you just gave him half guard so it just, and then he gave it back. He's still holding onto his neck. Look at, Hey, roll the ball with the neck. Oh my goodness. This is some blue belt level shit is a good thing for it to be a horrible idea. But uh, pulled guard, Eh Brendan Schaub getting crazy. Yeah. Not a good move. What look what level of Jujitsu when you compare, like say Metamorris Abu Dhabi and then you watch grappling like an average match in the UFC. Give me some volume there. Young Jamie, how much a difference do you think? What do you, what do you, what would you say the average is like in, in metamorris black belt in the U s level black.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       The average. His purple belt. I would really, I would say this is blue belt. What we're seeing, this is low level. Yes, this is blue belt, but I think the [inaudible] I'd say on average I'd say purple. He's not as having an arm bar. The elbows? No, no, he doesn't have that either. I was saying it was in the family and the, in that family. Do you think the average is purple belt? If you had, let's say, purple belt, whatever about yeah, that's a pro belt. And then when he went and then, but at one 55 black belt. Black belt. Yeah. Yeah. One 55 one 70 oh Hellboy how fucking good is Jim Miller's Jujitsu? God Ron's out and see that cause polarity hits fucking hardest shit man. Had kissed him on the back of the head. Wow. Where did he kiss the referee? Yeah. Good move.

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       Yeah. Keith Peterson's a sexy bitch. It's a good guy to kiss politely. See now there's a guy that is getting comfortable in the UFC and you're getting to see what everybody saw from him in the gym. Neon belly gets the mount. Dang. Oh, oh no. Even not even a lot behind it. Oh, he kissed him. Yeah. Awesome. Left underneath all that. Needed them daily check out the left. Not, but this is what everybody said about him. The guy fucking hits wicked hard. Look at this pump that left town and I look at guys that one eye open. Oh God. He's seeing all kinds of shit that you used to see when you were a little kid. When you saw those cartoons where a guy got hit in the head with a frying pan.

Speaker 2:          00:44:38       I think I saw that in the jungle. [inaudible] we'll talk about that tomorrow. So it's like 21 and three now I think. Yeah. Impressive. [inaudible] it's outside the UFC, so I don't want to do the Haka because I can only get behind it. My favorite thing, I watched the all blacks hoc all the time. I do it. Am I going to be up? Yep. Sorry for yourself. You haven't a fucking pity party. Well, no idea. Youtube with a Haka. Nobody wants to be Samoan more than me, so I may or may not have written my own Haka actually really go to battle. Sorry sir. Swim across the orange potion, the dugout canoes. I realized that I couldn't do anything with it, but I've tried. It's all right man. So right. As was motivated as far as that Haka, I watched a lot of watch, a little cowl Drogo game of Thrones. As far as Joe, if you think Jujitsu, is that okay? It approvable

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       level overall we're talking I'll weight classes. What would you say? Striking purple belt as well? Probably would say, yeah, I mean if you pay attention to like look at high level boxing, look at high level Moitai look at high level kickboxing and the difference between kickboxing and Muay Thai. For folks who don't know, if you watch him like glory, what they're not allowed to do in glory and I'd Love Glory but what they're not allowed to do his elbows to the head and the not allowed to clinch and throw knees. But Moy Tai, that's a big part of my time, a big, and it also protects fighters and in a, in a good instance, a good a example rather a guy like John Wayne par multiple time Moy Thai champion, but not really allowed to use his full skillset when he fights in glory. And I'm a fan of why is that?

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Why? Because Gloria has decided they want to go to the k one route. And what k one decided was they used to let you clinch with two hands, but then Alastair started kneeing guys into oblivion. So they changed two hands to one hand. Sakharova yeah. Could Sakharova fun with it? Oh No. It was a who did he fight where he broke his, his chin, uh, soccer. Rob and broke his chin over him. Did it to him. No, no Overeem. Never fought soccer. I think you're thinking of Melvin Manhoef. Nope. No fought soccer. Rabo Sakuraba only in Muay Thai. MMA. He never fought when we tie it was MMA booze in the clinch. He broke his chin. Sorry, I just heard, I'm not sure what fight that wasn't me. Soccer Sakharova has taken some fucking brutal beatings in his time. But the bottom line is that you're, you're not as able to defend yourself if you're fighting kickboxing because kickboxing, you have all these other things that you can do.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       You know you can grab the plum, you can shove your head up into the side of his head and really control that clinch, a need of the body and trip and throw him to the ground. There's all these different things that you could do. Like you watch the only promotion in America that allows that as lion fights and you can wash out an access TV. Great, great, great fights. I love watching that and you, you, we see some really like high level Moy, Tai, you see all the elbows, you see the, the, there's, there's all these tools that guys are allowed to use and stand up an MMA that you can't use and dream we can't or rather a you can't use in k one and he can't use in glory.

Speaker 2:          00:47:53       One of the most confusing things I ever saw was watching fights in Bangkok and similarly in Thailand because the rule system there for the Muy Thai fight, first of all it's epic cause their bet everybody taught at that time like come on the way though they will do like in first round they'll a lot of times because they bet on things like how many, how many, uh, roundhouse. Second I sort of the right side. They do all kinds of stuff. You're a guy, if you're betting on your guy, your guy will get that notion. He'll get that note and he'll actually, so that you can never tell how somebody's going to do, how good a fight or somebody is by watching their first round. Yeah. There's a lot of times, a lot of the best things in a lot of guts came in after that.

Speaker 2:          00:48:30       But you would watch these fights and there'd be some, the crowd would go crazy for a knee to the body, like crazy for a need of the body or kicked in the leg or something like that. And then you'd see like an American guy in their English guy, I don't know, white guy in there and he would just start like in late around just start lighting somebody up with punches to the face, like Hook, cross, upper cut and you're like, oh shit. Oh Shit. But I'm the only one yelling. And then at the end of the fight I'm like, man, that guy kicked the other guys as Joe and hit me. It's the, it's the Thai guy who landed more knees that when what is going not Sakharova Fujita

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       No. Yeah, he got a plot. Overeem, Overeem. What he did was kick was nice. Yeah, it kicked, that was Eddie Wineland and he knocked out. He's gonna Fight Tj Dillashaw such a good back. Bacchic yeah, that's Hanan. Barao he might be the best pound for pound guy on the planet around phenomena. Phenomenal. He's not the best. He's close to it yet, but I'm t j by Japanese necktie. Oh yeah. Maybe I wouldn't that be crazy though. That'd be dope. I showed it to him at the Onnit headquarters. Did you really? I couldn't believe you didn't know it. Never seen it. No, neither did a t TJ didn't know. And Danny Castillo, neither one of those guys knew it. Amun Ra and the Japanese neck hold with them. Yeah, well I showed them some techniques that I, well the only tapping was uh, that and then I just put them in rubber guard and asked him to escape.

Speaker 1:          00:49:51       And then I got him in the M and Ari. Do you know the MNR well, I was trying to show Whitney. I don't know the names to a problem. A lot of Bravo. Well [inaudible] not Bravo's. It's a and technique. It's a, it's basically an Omoplata. We finished with a neck crank. You go for the Omoplata when you got the guy, you know how you got a guy flatten down, you've got the seat belt. Yeah. You grabbed the neck. It's a fucking devastating move. I'll pull it up for you to just do it to me. No, I'll show you. Just do it to me. Well, you can just voice gets raspy my dick out on God. The bone or is everywhere. This podcast is the best, but because Google uh, imaginary all my plot, a neck crank, there's a video of it. It's pretty fucking dope dude. He um, he really knows how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       He and he invented that. Ever seen it? I never saw anybody do it before. Mnr He did. We got some videos of you teaching that on the, on it youtube too. Oh is that on, on its youtube? I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Better get audit. I asked, I asked Danny if he had ever seen it before and that strangle, the minute I had him in the eye, I asked him to get out of a rubber guard. He couldn't get out of rubber guard cause if a guy's got a good mission control, it's pretty surprising. Like you get in a guy like Katie Bravo's guard and ask, you know, like try to get out of it. You're completely clamped down. But the, the thing about it is that you don't know where you're in danger. You don't know which, which Mu, it's, there's so many non traditional attacks from that position.

Speaker 1:          00:51:32       But Suman, Ari figured out this dope ass grip neck crank. You just reach under the Chin with the escript and you really can't fucking defend it because your right arm totally trapped in the Omoplata. Right. You're attacking the shoulder just sitting up getting an s grip on the neck anywhere around the neck and just yanking that motherfucker back. It's essentially your entire core, all the weight of your bag and everything on the unprotected neck. There's not a lot you can do to defend hard to finish. It was very hard to finish it anyway. A lot in the heavyweight heavyweight. I feel like it's even worse. Guys are so big. What is that? What is the one? Jujitsu and man is one. If they'd done a stiff at stat on what the one Jujitsu move in the UFC the most, the most successful submission rate. I'd say Katie because more people know it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:23       A lot of guys aren't going to pull off, you know all these kids be interesting. Is the chat rear naked chokes cause that's been on a steady choking [inaudible] up there. I don't know. It's hard with the gloves. The gloves is what makes it hard, man. It's almost now people have to be dazed for you to see, you know, see someone famous or they have to be giving a cowboy Serone when he had a Barbosa days. Then even, you know, just all over. Yeah. Tj. Hello Tj. Let's do this shit. Tough to be a good one. That TV over there. That's a crazy fight, man. That's going to be a crazy fight. Oh, there's an Minari pulling it off on that foot. Look at that. On that TV. Pull it. Pull back it up a little bit, Jamie, so we could get a look at it as the guy rolls repeating Gif this. See how he gets it. Look at that in the world. Is that strs? That is so nasty. Oh no, that's bad, man. Let me do it to Brian. No Way Tot death. That's how it went away. If you've got a neck problem now, fucking forget that. That's just from count with terrible. That's literally how break your fucking

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       body. Beautiful technique though. It's super effective. Rarely Plata, and you just grab his head like that. Especially if the guy's trying to release your legs to try to save his arm because you kind of give up. Your right arm is trapped now there he gets underneath that checks, but you don't have to go anywhere around the space. It's basically a net crank and you're, you're breaking your spine. I mean, she's a horrible, horrible position. You're putting so much pressure on the discs. It's honorable man. I mean I'll, I'll show you after the podcast, the set up, it's super, super clean and it's one of those techniques where it's there the whole time, but nobody does it. Sort of like the Japanese necktie necktie where a lot of guys want to get the dark. He can't get the Darth, they don't know that neck ties, but you weren't there the whole time.

Speaker 3:          00:54:11       You know that right? You, you do that Japanese necktie on familiar, we should go over it after your Doris is fucking nasty man. That Darcy you hit mitre on with that was locked down tight. That was bank vault tight. Yeah. Darcy, that's just forever. You know, things could just come to you for whatever reason. I see Darcy's everywhere. It's for whatever reason. I just see as soon as surgeon and Jujitsu, they show me the doors and then I was just right away. It was just something they showed me once and it was in my [inaudible]. There's some guys that just like certain techniques really click with them. So weird. Now we're like Paul Sas triangles, Bang, Bang, Bang. He just, that's his thing. That guy you'd get caught and Paul sasses guard you gotta fucking get out of there and run. That mother fucker would triangle the shit out of you.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       It's weird. Other guys, that triangle is just dog shit week. He could find a way to get on high level guys to the like, uh, I'll do Darcy's on guys, super high level guys and then I'm like, you're not a dark sky. Like No. Like they don't even, they don't even mess with it. They don't even care to mess with it. I don't have to arm bars or whatever. I don't understand that Darcy is such a potent weapon such as shit man. When it with the guys. The reason I developed it a lot. It's because with Shane car I was shooting in on me. I should come up with something, right? So it was gay teens and Darcy's had to come up with something out of desperation. Rilla out attack feet. Watch me in the face. Browse a beast, man. He's a motherfucker, dude. He is as good as it gets.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       Undefeated winning streak in MMA. Is that true? That's crazy. That's the longest I think. Something crazy. Let's find out. It's 36 38 well, when you're, when you're training partners, uh, Jose Aldo that, no, the thing is the weight class he's in, he's fighting black belts and everything. Everything. It's hard to even comprehend that long. The fight streak as a fighter. To me, that's kind of speed and stuff too. Like where everybody's fast length. Yeah. Let's see. Daniel Cormier, who was about five foot one picking dudes up and just look at that. He's not fight for one five, eight, five, nine. He's not that much taller than that. He's five 11 that's a lie. I stood next to him. I towered over him. He was like, man, you're tall. I was like, thanks man cause I love your work that I was like, thank you. I was like, you're way more athletic and person.

Speaker 3:          00:56:26       I was like, I know I wrestled six feet tall. Go fuck yourself feet tall. Towering. I was literally, you are wearing stilts. I was, that's true. Women's shoes. Well this is a good meal. Magni and Tim means you'll get mad at me. Eye strain within Denver. We call him the Gazelle because this kid's cardio is insane. Insane. That guy has fangs. He's so tough. He's really tough on animal to both guys are animals and both guys are very similar. Real tall guys for 55 and means he knocked out Pete Spratt at once. 70 man listen, the the difference between means and magnesium, magnesium, my boy, but the difference is means is just nasty and each switches things up. Like you'll see Neal, his movements great, but it's more of like a point scoring system for him. He's just touching like Neil's, I don't think it's ever knocked anyone out in his life.

Speaker 3:          00:57:23       All he's doing is beating you off points. You'll see a jab of right hand jab right hand and he's just moving the whole time. Means does not play that man. He means reminds me of a Carlos condit. Isn't that interesting that that's one of the reasons why magnet can keep going forever and ever. I was just like that. He's not putting on a commander. No. Yeah. That's a weird thing, isn't it? Where you're not totally 100% committing to techniques, but you can keep going for a way longer with that. What do you think about that? That's what you have to have a, you have to have a mix of that. You have to, you look at the guys at the top. There's a mix, right? You can't go. For instance, if we look at the fights recently, look at Travis Brown and I talked to her doom last Tuesday about this.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       Verdomme said every shot that Travis was stolen was that had bad intentions, knockout power. He's trying to knock them out in one shot. He was up putting combos together. It makes for a high as an ad, a high level. It's, that's not gonna work, man. Guys. See it and they're getting out of the way and they're gonna take, you said it, you said about Travis Brown and you said there's no method, there's no method to the madness. And you said they keys, there's nothing behind. There is no strategy behind. Listen, you can't put, you can't floor your car in seventh gear and just it's gonna burn out. You just can't do it. You have to use all the gears and the guys at the very highest level are using all the gears, like looking at dos Santos, he comes out very relaxed, Jab, Jab, and then you're gonna see a big shot and he's back down to second gear, but he's not chilling at seventh gear like Shane Carlin.

Speaker 3:          00:58:54       Yeah, I see what you're saying. I would just say first gear, first gear, third gear, but yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah. I think that there's a, there's not good, it's not good. There's some guys who do fight like that though. They just explode, explode, explode, explode, explode. And then by the time the third round comes along and a high level guys, I'm like, cool, let's we're going to drag his ass to the third round, the third round we're going to go to work and submit this wall. That's why I was really interesting to really interested to see what would happen with Tyron Woodley and Jay and Carlos condit. I agree. Unfortunately for Cangelosi and Roy McDonald though, right? With dollar drag is athlete. You have to wait before maybe if he had survived the onslaught. Woodley is so fucking fast. Wrong. You should see this guy in the gym hit Mitts. Nah, I don't want to see it scared me up at night, bro. It's insane.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       I don't want to see it. Any might place third and miss the Olympia right now. He's just never ever say, why does he, why would you wear clothes when you walk to the grocery store? It's ridiculous. Just a Bandana just to keep this cutter from dragging him. I hope I saw me myths with his trainer Wildcard Real Pete had some type Valley Tudo showing things to do. I just chill man. How often is it wildcard? What's up? He's not an la guy. How often is he out? He's out here cause straighten coat. A striking coach Arnold. Is that a wildcard out here? Arnold? I met Arnold doing stunt director now was an extra in a B movie with heath herring and heath herring was beating me up and stealing my girlfriend in the movie and Arnold was the stunt coordinator. What's he doing now? He's playing poker. Poker.

Speaker 3:          01:00:37       I used to have, he's playing poker. You have more round shirt. What a fucking legit wild man. He's hair. I'll never forget his fight with Tom Erickson. Tom Erickson was on top of them dominating him and he was getting tired and they stood them up and pride and when they stood them up, heath herring just goes, Woo. Fucking slap. Erickson was like, oh fuck. And he just charged after herring and smashed him, kissed him and yeah, hailed him classic at the fucking stare-down right now. He shook his head before he punched him too. He could tell he thought about it. He's like, no, fuck this. He got suspended. That's dope. Got this bent. They probably gave him some money to. These guys are very similar, but the difference in this fight will be Tim means it just has a nasty, nasty streak. Oh, this is one 70 yes.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       Means has been fighting. If 55 though, has he not, he's been fighting in the MFC, but before that, when he fought in the UFC, I look at this learning, look at this. Look, what are we doing? He does remind me of Carl's comment, right? Yeah. He's fought lightweight, lightweight quite a few times. I'm going to get to, that's what kind of tattoo should I get, guys? You should get a dove daddy dick on your chest. Like Brock Lesnar. I dealt with a Dick flying loss twice in the UFC at lightweight. He lost against Muscovy doll and he lost against Danny Castillo. So I think that he was having a hard time making that weight. And why would he was only six foot fucking to these crazy six three bro. No, it's crazy. It's crazy. Fuckers that drops off my boys,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Loren Landow and the battery one 17 he's got muscle on him. That's crazy. What I mean, that's magnes reaches insane. Yeah. Like I said, the differences, these guys are very similar, same size. Magna has great footwork, but Tim means just has this killer's Macchiato for Jack Timber. No, Denver. Yeah. Means is like a dirty means. It's like you want to go to the ground does not cure where it goes, man. He just wants to finish the fight magnet will not get tired. Huh? Nope. Means it's got real good head movement too. I like how he that Longreach another thing that people don't talk about about Longreach. Yeah, but the long reach, the ability to bend at the waist and move away from Shit. That's, that's one of the things that Jon Jones does so well. Best in the moving away from Shit not getting hit. Yeah. I guarantee you the game plan here for Neil Magni is don't wait.

Speaker 1:          01:03:09       As soon as you hit the cage, get off. You're going to see them circling, constantly circling. It's interesting how different body types have different advantages like he got that who some are Paul Horez body. What ted is just a huge advantage for ripping off legs. Rip on a hall of legs and if you watched his fight with Ivan salivary, basically anything he does in grappling, he's just so ridiculous. Came out of his mom and put her in ankle lock just to tick is dude. Do you ever see video of him rolling with the Mayhem Miller? Yeah. It just talk to mom about that man said he was really hung over though. Yeah, whatever. Whatever. I would say that too. If I got fucking two cost, it's trial that day. Such a monster for a guy like me. Paul hires is scary man. Me and Doug Davidoff tried to fight mayhem on time.

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       We tried to grab him and He Ooh, get jab. See I like this moving out of Neal. But like if you see, you see what I mean? Went by point sparring. It's just Jab, move, Jab, move, Jab. Well he's, there's no bad intentions. It's not loading up on any, what's the difference between his style and like the Diaz brothers then cause they kind of, his brother's load up eventually but pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, boom, boom to the body. Diaz is, it's, it's almost like a machine gun. It's like for five rounds. They also seem like high level boxers and comparison. Well, he also has, Diaz has an incredible chin, especially nick. They just come forward, just keep coming and nick as an eventual cheers guys out. Well, frank shamrock said it best when he fought Nick Diaz. He's like, you can't breathe because he's always hitting you and every time he hits you tighten up because even if it's only a 50% shot, you still have to hold your breath and then he rips you to the bottom and then you're just, you never, you never breathe and he's landing 80% of those 50 shots.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       It's crazy, man. He does triathlons and he swam back from Alcatraz twice. Come on, stop it. Yes, he did shark infested waters. He's out of his mind. I love that guy more than I asked him to come on the podcast. I just don't believe he'll show up here. I would have him on. I love that fucking guy. Like, I love my mother, but I would, I would only have him on if I had a backup guest. I'm coming please, please, please, please. Out of the rankings.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Huh? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:05:19       I don't know about all that. I don't know what that was all about. That that bothers me. Just doesn't want to fight, Huh? No, he wants more money. He wants more money. Cause you found out what Gilbert, because Gilbert's his buddy and there was a, a contract negotiation with Gilbert Bella. Toi was trying to pick up Gilbert when his contract was over and they gave Gilbert a shit ton of money. And Nate is like, what the fuck? And so there's some sort of contract negotiation and I think there's also at that I should pay Nate. I love Nate and I agree, but I don't know who his manager is. I Dunno who negotiated his contract. I don't know what the deal is. But a deal's a deal's a deal is a deal. You got to stick to it and nice take down by name. It's one of those things where you talk publicly, you talk shit about the UFC and you're not going to win.

Speaker 5:          01:06:01       Man. What? What motivation did they have to, you know, to give you more money? Well, the other thing is too is guys forget there's no bigger guy than the UFC. The UFC is going to keep on the circus, keeps on going if one of the elephants fallout. So it just keeps on going. How about Eddie Alvarez backing out of the fucking Michael Chan Bell Tours? First pay view loves. It's gone. It's gone. It's going to evaporate. There's not going to be a paper if you know they're still doing it. They got it. They found a backup. Right? If some guy, Phil, who I've never heard of him, that's the problem. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       And now you want people's money. This really strange bike because it almost looks like they're sparring and it doesn't matter. And they'd still, I told you saw the point sparring. It's don't look that it's interesting. Tim means is a slow start. It doesn't seem concerned about any low kicks whatsoever. He says, well, he's just Kinda, oh,

Speaker 5:          01:06:52       by the way, this might be one of my favorite podcasts ever.

Speaker 2:          01:06:57       Just hanging out, watching our guys. Watch him fight just for guys with their pants. Oh, tagged them left by Magni out. Now you should have kept book means a fucking hanging in there, man. I brownie you coach. No, I wasn't. No I wasn't. I said, see, I stopped myself. I was like, hold on. Brian and I have conversations and they're not nearly as frustrating to me as they must be to you. Ryan and I have conversations. I just sit on the outside and call the fights, but Brian and I have conversations where I go, that's, that's no last week. Last weekend. Why don't guys just, just crescent kick, no crap. Well you haven't seen my crafts and kick last weekend during the Mayweather fight. I have to look over Miu. Hey Bro, do you mind just shutting the fuck up? I saw two rounds from me and he goes, can I shut up bro? You need my, you need my knees up one. Nothing

Speaker 5:          01:07:49       for sure. I want to get a shirt that says venom. So get a dove. Huh? How about venom has a tattoo. You do need? I have a problem. The only problem that I have with Bella toward the only problem is that there's not crossfit's like what do you mean? Like you know how like if a Bob Arum promoted fighter wants to fight a golden boy promoted fighter, they figured out a way to make it happen for pack. Y'All made it for Pacquiao, Mayweather and arguably that might be May. Whether it doesn't want to fight pack, pack. Yes. I want to find new about that. Want to do the drug test? Oh, I dunno about that. I don't know. It might be true. I mean total complete speculation. That also could be propaganda from the May where the camp, I'm not inside enough to speculate. However, what were you saying though about matching?

Speaker 5:          01:08:39       There's smoke, there's fire. So many people have said that pack, y'all was doing something. When a guy moves up one weight class, you go, well that's normal. The guys growing when a guy moves up eight week classes and knocks bitches [inaudible] that's weird. Hey, no speaking as a guy who's actually done steroids, I would say maybe he's done some steroids. I'd say maybe. I'm just saying, I'm just saying, I used to take this shit called Mag 10 that used to buy at Gnc at all this shit. I've done testosterone replacement. All the Shit I've done. Mag 10 was the crazy shit ever. Couldn't believe you could buy it. That's the shit they would take. Industry and Diane, I don't know what this mag 10 was, but they made it illegal quick. But I did a cycle with it. I grew tits. My Dick was as hard as hell.

Speaker 5:          01:09:28       Cat couldn't scratch it. It was unbelievable. I never had roid rage with anything that I've ever done cause I'm pretty calm guy. But the closest I ever got to Freud wages is on that stuff. You take 10 pills a day, you would buy in a store, take 10 pills a day. And I was like, how could I gained 10 day? I gain 10 pounds of muscle in six weeks and I'm not know healthy. Well, here's how I know it's not healthy. Cause when I stopped taking it, my Dick just went, hey, I'm going to see my dick was like, they kicked the row it, I quit. My Dick wasn't normal for a month and a half. Internet searches for bag 10 just went through the fucking roof. I know, I know. Not Legal. You can't buy it anymore. Okay, let me see if I can find it. If anybody finds mag seven, it just makes you shit. You'll find that in the store. And that's the thing that I'll say that I did steroids because I did this. I mean even though it's not like it's not considered a steroid because he could buy it at GMC, GMC rather. It's fucking steroids, man. Biotest mag 10 it doesn't exist anymore. You can't buy anymore more. 2001 it's illegal now. Yeah, it was incredible. I can't, might've been the greatest thing I've ever life.

Speaker 5:          01:10:57       It's 10 lbs. Daily recommended dose. I did well the daily recommended, just whatever it did. Turn your fucking monkey. It was crazy. But uh, that was when the game plan is for either one of these guys. I was recovering from an ACL, so I was taking it at the same time was taking, I was really lifting really heavy because I couldn't go everybody. Yeah. Yeah. All upper body, lower body. For the first couple months all I was doing was bodyweight squats. Just very light, trying to increase my, um, my flexibility and all that. Tim means all over him. Man. I like his nickname too. Dirty bird. Dirty bird. Dirty bird just said sponsors. Nah, I'm good. You know what I like about magnet? Put my dirty brick logo on the bag in the back of his legs. You know what I like about Beltour Jimmy Smith, that motherfucker, great guy and fucking on point as a commentator, he's very clear, very clear, knows his shit.

Speaker 5:          01:11:54       Black belt in Jujitsu. Damn means hitting him with a head, knees to the head when he was on the ground. I don't want to graph what the fuck man. He definitely got one hand was down one or two for sure. It's a tricky thing, man. I don't like that knee to the ground thing, knee on the ground. You can kind of sit there, right? You can job the system by touching your hand and lifting it up and touching your hand and lifting it up. That doesn't make sense for fighting to me. No. I think the knees to the, to the head for grounded opponent should be legal and less a part of your body is touching the cage. Why did they make that illegal? Because it's dangerous or this is where I think it should be illegal. When a guy's got his head pressed up against the cage ain't going.

Speaker 5:          01:12:32       You can't go anywhere. You can't move. That's why I like soccer kicks and stomps and pride because you could always spin your head around and go under the cage to avoid the technique. You know? You know why? I don't think they ever make that illegal because a America is not ready for it. Teeth. They think this hotel flying to violent as it is now. Then the terrorists win the terrorist wing. You can't punch somebodies head like a soccer ball, but why not? I mean, I know Bob. It would hurt. It would hurt to it. You would get some of that fancy wine. Unwanted press. Yeah, but I don't believe in unwanted press. I think it's bullshit. As long as you could debate it. Why? Why should you be allowed to wheel? Kick your guy in the head. But I can soccer kick probably cause a wheel kicks harder to get off.

Speaker 5:          01:13:12       Mirko Cro, cop soccer, soccer kick. Ron Waterman the face. Yes. Horrific. Little short about Ron Waterman chucked me out with this titties when I was a white belt. Literally put my face between his tits and choke me up. Come on, I'm conscious unconscious or you tapped that but, but he almost broke my nose. He almost broke my, he's a big fuck. And he was doing it for Jesus and real set of tits on him though. And he was choking you for Jesus, right? He shows me for Jesus. Did he give you a cross afterwards or maybe a Bible? Give me a little pep talk. Slap on the ass. Give me a pep talk after he bought me a sandwich. Pity. I'm super embarrassed. How many shines goes. Don't worry brother. He did that to me before. Look at that sandwich to the KFC thing that they're promoted that double down. I'm a big fan of that. Hell No. I'm going to fast food home with 12 you don't need to have it. You know there's a place in Montreal called Joe Beef and they did a variation on a double down, ready for this two chunks of fog. Voila. So time is of deep fried duck liver. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       in between Bacon and cheese. And it might be the best thing I've ever had in my life. You know what? I wonder if I don't like shitting my pants so I don't eat. I do not eat that stuff, bro. You want to shit your pants? Okay. I don't, but [inaudible] good question. If anyone, if you want to shit your pants, drink a shitload of coconut oil. Okay, sure. Oh, I drink that shit every day. Not a heavy dose. Heavy dose in the morning, I have to run back and I said to the gym or cocky rocket shit out of my asshole like Kale shakes. I drink a Kale shake in the morning. Those that love me for me, it doesn't bother me, but it just, it's, it's basically like rude or down the drain. They say you're not supposed to. You're not supposed to drink too many Kale shakes.

Speaker 2:          01:15:06       Too many spinach shakes and things because it actually, because it's a big leafy green vegetables. There's a lot of toxins in the lead is not toxic. Wildcats, healthy Brian, you could use listen, knucklehead. Listen, I ahead. You've got to stop saying shit like that when you don't research it because you can't. No, you haven't because you can counteract all that stuff with calcium. Oxalic acid is the problem, but you can counteract it with calcium. No, no, no. Here's what, here's what I'll say about when you and your friends, when you eat, when you eat a lot of meeting, a lot of raw leafy greens. Here's, here's the, the issue with the problem is that a lot of times leafy Greens because they have to keep insects and they produce oxalic acid. He countered that with calcium. Just go online, not just stocks, Chasse, fuck these other things.

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       Well, what are these other things where they're all Tim means it's all over Neil magnate. That's, that's no close fight. This is fucking great fight. Whatever things Brian come toxins that keep, no, no, no, no, no, no other talks. You know better than you. Green Leaf expert pro and googling shit before. Talk about it. Okay. I have a very [inaudible] back guys. Go to their back. That's twice. We've seen that with Karrie Yasso dos Santos and cane Sean Shelby people not even watching the fights guys fucking ring side of the greatest fucking supporting of it. Look at Bruce Buffer. He's sleeping, sleeping. Sean Shelby people. Too many fights. You're never going to see that for me, man. Never going to see that from me. You, you see me ringside in a fight. You see me either glued to a monitor or watch the fights. People always ask me that like, you're bored. Fucking never. Never. When when those bells ring, especially a fight like this, this is a great fucking fight back and forth. For sure. Fuck yeah, man. It's a great fight. Brian Coogler,

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       people telling me that David Asprey, Dave Asprey, and John Duran, Dave Aspery, you fuck you not even paying attention. Dave Asprey offers solutions. He offered solutions. Calcium was one of them. God Damn. Fuck I fucking, you hurt my feelings because I love you. Whatever, dude, I love you but you. You give out shit tweets they fucking hate. They hate it comes at me. I'm like, I love him. I ain't got you don't know him. He tell you fuck whores. We're flawed. I am flawed too. Everyone's flawed. You know I have a real problem with people that only complained about people. You don't talk shit about themselves. It really bothers me. Know there's a lot of that with people who write blogs. I never talk shit about anybody I said bore. You're just talking shit about vegetables. I'm a preacher about spinach.

Speaker 6:          01:17:58       I spent I juice every morning of fuck

Speaker 5:          01:18:01       every morning. Yeah, I feel great. You look very toxic feelings to Brent. It looks pretty healthy. By the way, a healthy fucking animal is going to be a sabbath. Looks pretty healthy. That'd be healthy. He's a fucking UFC fighter. Got No choice. Really. It's a professional comedian voice. I don't have any convictions. Oh fuck. I don't fight for my kid. This man can be the difference. And, and look at me and starting to slow down. Neil Mag, these main training partner named Mark Cart. So is that right? Oh boy.

Speaker 6:          01:18:26       Oh

Speaker 5:          01:18:28       Wow. So close means fucking mouth loaded out of it. These gates in his long legs, man. Good body triangle. Oh good. Uh, but rather a bag. So when, when needed that switches to mount, when Neal came off, uh, I think it was the ultimate fighter. 14 when chin, Carmen was the coach. He lived with Nate, Mark Cart and his wife. They loved having them around so much. He basically stayed there for a year and became their babysitter. Is that right? True Story. Wow. Take some freaky stuff was going on. I like to think,

Speaker 6:          01:19:01       well, your information before you say things like that, that's on Google. Brian Magni.

Speaker 5:          01:19:07       And he keeps trying to get that back triangle but can't get it. Look at me. Man's controlling that alarm. Yup. That's a big move. But get this, he gives up the fucking mountain, goes to butterfly half guard. Neil was trying to isolate that arm in arm. Yeah. Get that arm. But it doesn't have the arm in the right position. No. If you're going to isolate it, you've got to go down and cross. It shows you can go to mountain. Why is this doing? Why is he going to head and arm the first place? So weird position. He's holding Super Weird homeboy get past the side. He's just taking a break, taking a little break there. You know, he's still in his half guard. He's just taking a little break. Was there, but Neal's given him all sorts of space, like oh space. When I was over the baby, I was over Hixon Gracie's house once and we watched coliseum 2000 is a mixed martial arts event in Japan back in the does a, when a Hixon fought who? Nakia. And uh, that was think Hickson's last fight. And uh, was he talking to him? Look at him. I dunno, but Neil, one to one I think. Where were you saying though, Joe? But Hixon uh, was, uh, it's so amazing watching fights with Hixon when he starts breaking out positions. He, yeah, he, he gets this gusted when he sees space,

Speaker 2:          01:20:19       when they see these guys, they're shitty

Speaker 5:          01:20:22       side controlled shitty mounts and he goes, when I go to, when we start, we're neutral position. Well if I go to one, we're not going back to wall zero. We've started at zero. I moved to Juan and from one I go to, I'm not going back to zero. I'm going to one and then two, two and then checkmate.

Speaker 2:          01:20:42       Yeah, he's made and then they say this, I believe you. But by the way, maybe it has. No, I've never seen I does he ever cracked jokes in his life? Is he dead serious all the time? I don't know. I mean, I'm sure if you're around them and you know you, you've fucking been strangled by him sufficiently that he knows pretty cool. You understand your position. The mean he is Frank Grillo and my buddy trained with him for a long time was on his competition teams. Z, a green baret navy seal zipper that you know that name ever guys serve combat riot police, little former world champion. He Won. He won the world championships and everything. Tell me about her friends cause they make you a better person, but he said, he said that all your friends does to make you a better person and you find that a frat girl, it doesn't even exist.

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       He was in captain America. I played this one of the Jerky boys. No, he's an American play. One of the Philippines. I don't mean I didn't see it but then the latest captain America had a big part. Okay. And he said that picks someone, let you put him in and his purple belt, anybody put them in and literally like a choke hold and count the 10 he'd be like, I'm going to get out of this and ten nine hey tell you what he was going to do. Black belts do that. Yeah, he would. He tell you what he was going to do to you. I'm going to put you in an arm bar, no matter what you do to it.

Speaker 5:          01:21:57       He full back control with the hooks in a rear naked choke locked in and you would get out. It's ridiculous. It is Neil getting the win, but it's not. If you let a white belt do it to you. Yeah, I would let a white paper that to me, I agree and hates Kale. Yeah. Yo magnate. Nice big. That style, that style of, you know, never committing 100% to everything. What's his name ran off. Huh? He's not to me Brian. He just lost a really big fight. A big fucking event. Where's on magnet train now he's at grudge. Oh Colorado. You know what? You know he's not, he's not at crutch. Head coaches. Lease for bowling and he's with a date mark cart and Cody Donovan, those guys in Denver at elevate. Ah, yes sir. Team elevate and they turn out that muscle farm. Jim, that Jim's read Dick. Is it? Ah, state of the art. It's from Kennedy was on the podcast here. They talking mad shit about muscle farm products. I've never had them.

Speaker 2:          01:22:55       I've never had it myself. I just know the facility. I love six star products. I just know, I just know the muscle farm. Jim Is Nice. Their products probably make you shit your pants. I Dunno.

Speaker 6:          01:23:06       I Dunno.

Speaker 5:          01:23:14       I'm not a big fan of shitting my pants bad. Depends what I'm spoiled with that. It depends on what I'm doing. I'm Sarah and I ain't got nothing to put on a good movie. Shit my pants by the way. Thanks for animating that. That shit story. A video that Joe and I did you see animated it. Oh Dude, you didn't get it. Some Guy Online. Yeah, they animated. It made it really funny too. There's so many funny fucking people. So great. Was your shit story about you running around from away from the girl in the woods when we were talking about when we were doing well, I was telling you, oh the one the shit story when we were we shit shit on a stick to your story that no one's animated. Someone hear my call. The story that you told about running away from girl? Yeah. Brian was hiking with a girl and he had a shit, his pants, so we made a game out of it. I ran into the woods. She's like, what are you going,

Speaker 6:          01:24:01       we are back. I'm trying to scare you. Oh, shouting out of my ass hole shouting out of mass mass. It was literally by the end it was like as I, and she came walking in, I was like, Ooh, look at the hawk. Ooh, make faces at her [inaudible] here and has a beer, more tasks. You finally heard it cause I couldn't get around and tie and she goes, are you sick? I go, I think so. She smelled it. I had to walk her through it back through the minefield. We had to turn back around my floor, asshole, all chasing dirty.

Speaker 5:          01:24:35       You know if a girl can deal with that, if you can say, hey listen, I don't want to lie to you, but I got fucking crazy diarrhea. It was like a first day and guess what? She couldn't deal with it. In fact it's are a year later. She ran out of the fucking door, but that's good. That's good. You got off light. What would you do if you on a date with a chick and she said she has bad diarrhea. I said, it's, look, we're human. It's all good. I would, that's what I would say. Well, yes. Are you tad fucker anyway? Well you definitely fucker anyway, but even I probably wouldn't fuck her right then and let her wash up. Diarrhea, diarrhea doesn't really get my dick hard. That's the thing is I wouldn't judge her but some people would get upset at you and that's like just a weakness thing.

Speaker 5:          01:25:13       They would sense weakness in you but they probably sense weakness in you because you tried to hide it. Whereas the guy like me would say, hey listen, I got fucking diarrhea so we deal with this or not. It's all good. I can understand if you hate me now, but I'm going to go shit behind this trip I was in, I was in an acting class and this huck, the guy goes, hey, I got to say this before because this is on, I fucking hate this nas commercial and I'm done. You can't keep showing this God damn thing. What was the guy throws all these wild kicks and the other guy comes out and punches him in the face and then drink some caffeine. Yeah. Punched him in the face and then eat. And then these are folk who cool, calm and collected caffeine because I was knocked out. I totally need to be stimulated because I just knocked the guy out. No, because I wa

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       I was once on a like really super early in dating this girl and I got food poisoning, were sleeping in the same hotel room together when we met him. We met in Greece. So I drink a bunch of Ouzo and pass the fuck out. I like terrible food poisoning. Quick work. Yeah. Cause I thought maybe it helped the food poisoning. He could call up like a fucking baby. Woke up, woke up here. Oh my God. And I was like, wow, what? I was like, no, no, no, no. And she just jumps out at [inaudible] and a huge, that's a huge issue you have to throw away. That's not what's important. What's important is what happened. Tours with the girl. It was a lot of laughter. And anytime I tried to be like romantic and we'd be having a wine, she just looked at me and just crack the fuck off.

Speaker 2:          01:26:55       I'm like, how is he says I shit myself. Right? And you're like, oh, your friends are the best for you. Look at this fucking pregame. This girl's tits are popping out. She's with a black guy or on TV. I'm upset that your voice gets very high. I get angry that she's hot as fuck. That's ridiculous. Have you had, have you ever had a girl blow up your bathroom? Oh yeah. Oh, I deal breaker. I have lose my number. No, you blow up my bathroom ever. You and I are different now. I had a problem. I was fight of the night right here. Oh yeah. Cooking, uh, Derek Cruickshank and Eric Cooks Superstore about to fight right now. New Breed and Detroit superstar about to throw down great coke, Duke Group, Phis trained fighter. And so his Cruickshank, by the way, when I was at Duke's camp, um, I was, I was trained at Duke's place when I was in Minneapolis and Cruickshank was there and coke is one of his boys.

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       So this is kind of interesting. I didn't know that. Brendan, you have a tough, this isn't crazy. I gotta just say, please don't say something stupid. [inaudible] job. You got a bottle opener. I'm nervous as shit when, when you see that little thing pop up at the bottom says you have to see one 74. I was like this. What makes you scared? I'm scared. It's just nervous. I can see it. So you have to think about it. Do you try to avoid thinking about fights is much as possible before you do them? Um, that's a good question. By the time I get home, I'm still exhausted. I really don't think about it. I'll wake up. Sometimes I'll sleep like shit thing about our Lawsky, stuff like that. But I'm just so exhausted by the time I get home. I'm really just know I would never compare myself to anything that you've done. But I did some competing when I was younger and one of the things that I found was I won the US Open when I was 19 years old. And one of the reasons I think that I want it is cause I didn't think I was fighting and it was because I had fought the week before and I had injured my hamstring on my groin rather. And uh,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       the, the tournament was the week after that and I was like, well I'm not going to find him. I'm, I'm hurt this thing I need to heal up. And then I woke up the morning of the fights and I had a bunch of donuts and then I had some coffee cause I used to have a paper route. It's always to make money. When I was fighting, I said, get up in the morning, I'd get up at 5:00 AM and I would deliver papers from five to seven. Then they go back to sleep. Wow. And so, uh, I, I had these fucking Dunkin donuts donuts with powdered sugar and lemon filling and a, and I had some Boston cream donuts and I was cooking for you lit up with sugar. And I was like, I'm fucking fighting. So I got in my car, I went home, packed my bag and I w I, I not only did I not think about it, I told myself I wasn't fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       Right. So for a week I was relaxed as fuck and I did no training whatsoever. I mean, I might have liked, did some stretching. I would definitely worked out in the pool because that's what I would do when I wasn't fighting. If I was injured, I tore my, uh, Sartorius muscle besides my ACL is one of the biggest injuries I ever had was a bit, it's a hell of a sartorial, connects your hip to your quadricep. It's a pretty big muscle. And it was a pretty bad in terms like a dinosaur. It was a for a few months, I couldn't throw any kicks. It all, it was pretty bad. But, um, so besides that, this I'd hurt myself. So I said, you know what, let me just take some time off. I did a little swimming and this and that and the day of I decided, fuck it, I'm fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       But I fought so good because I had slept. I slept good. I relaxed I the whole week, I wasn't nervous. I was Z. I had zero nerves the whole week because I was convinced that I wasn't fighting. So it was just a sugar rush, a split decision. And it was one of them. I did work, but as a taekwondo fighter, it was one of my biggest victories. Winning the US Open. It was like a big phone. I've also heard from some athletes when you're a little bit injured too, it kind of takes some of the pressure off of you for your own performance. You're like, well, I'm injured anyway. You just relax. You don't have a train. Like I think Bernard Hopkins will you telling me, Bernard Hopkins says that it said something like, why would I train most of these guys? Overtrain he doesn't even train them. Well now as he's older and Larry Holmes said the same thing, he realized, why am I training an hour and a half for a 30 minute fight?

Speaker 1:          01:31:17       True. And that just comes with experience and about Roger Federer. The top tennis players do not practice more than two hours a day. It sounds really surprised. Hours a day is a long, it's a long time. We were just talking about some bad motherfucking sport. Nobody's playing in Chins off your head. Play four or five hours, bro. I don't give a fuck if you need to learn tennis. Rob Talking about [inaudible] for two hours. Here's the, here's the best today. Take it guy who weighs about the same that I do and who runs an ultra marathon. He runs a hundred miles, right? Give him a month off and I'll fucking strangle him. He doesn't have a chance, is no

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       chance. You know why? Because it's not a marathon. If you lock up with me, you don't know what you're doing. I'm going to choke the shit out of you. See, a marathon is nonsense. You just running. No one's kicking you. No one's throwing rocks at you. There's no niggers historic, difficult ignorance in this room. Ladies and gentlemen, I will make you give me some volume to drown out. You see my fucking wheel kick? I'm going to flip out right now. [inaudible] whoa. He's the underdog. Huge underdog. Plus the 55 is what does that mean? What does, how do they come to that number? Put $100 on him, right? You know what I'm saying? He's basically a three to 100 almost four and a half. That is fucking interesting. That's an interesting fucking who dog. Who makes those yards. They what experts are doing that? Who is doing someone sets an initial line cause a bedding.

Speaker 2:          01:32:57       Whoa. He's minus four 50 sees a heavier fabric. Look at that Tattoo. Of course he's mine is four 50 what is that? It's terrifying. I think it's a Jrr Tolkien or something. Who knows? It's probably his favorite author. Hello, Gary Cohn. Gary Copeland is as wide as he as tall and he's not very tall. He's fantastic. He is fantastic about Chrissy. How she's good girl. By the way, Brian, if you ever want to put you said she's a good girl. You played tennis gentlemen in the room and make you make you quit or table tennis is an athlete. I felt this back. He's got to valley for a back. I appreciate it. Let's see. Cruickshank and oh gosh, a tag coke with right hand double valley tuto shorts, cooked, shine. Coming off of that victory is very, very hyped dude. The way he mixes things up is insane.

Speaker 2:          01:33:45       You just can't train for it, but the kicks, the angles. His hands are low, dude. He's trying to make him pay with every kick. That's what you gotta do with the kicker, man. If you're a coke going to Barbara, a chart who gets the girl? Well, the shop does his fight versus he's too small. The giant is my first as Mike Rock. When you see a girl like shop, you just got to get her away and he's on fire. I've got to run. It's true cancer. It's fucking, it's Ariel. I disappear when I'm standing next to him. I disappeared. I looked like a cup of coffee. I could be a candle. It doesn't matter when you might just go girls, Brian is aids. I'm like, I look like I do. He wouldn't get tests. I'm all gone by the way. Definitely the last guy on earth that gets tested. Definitely not like Bro. It's not meant to feel fine. Whatever. I just say he fights, I play tennis, whatever else. He has his Duke in and out with the A's. He's happy to just be a battle. Just a huge cock block. His body is a battleground with a big kick to the body. You know it's interesting. Like I said, because when I was at Rufus Sport, Cruickshank was trained there when they had the UFC

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       in Milwaukee. That fucking southpaw stance, it's always tricky. South paws are tricky man. They are tricky, but they're opened up for right hand. Right, but they also start to deal with, they're used to it more than you are correct. Unless you train on a regular basis. They're really good. South paw, south falls are tough, man. Metro was a south pole. It's tough to find a high level South Pole guy. Oh, nice. Little snappy, snappy, right. Jab is a motherfucker man. Straight rights or how you beat a South Pole. But Cruickshank I was so impressed with him in that Mike Rio Fight. And I know Mike Rio is primarily a grappler. So, uh, the difference between, Ooh, nice inside leg kick. I like how he set it up with the punches. He's got the boat, got crazy explosion this fast. Good Job Ryan.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       Cause I liked it. I like to come that myself, I keep myself going because obviously I'm surrounded by enemies in his fucking surrounded by people would not appreciate tennis except for Aubrey. Aubrey gentlemen. Oh God, thank God you're here.

Speaker 5:          01:36:03       God, you're here fighting a bunch of parents. Oh right hand by Cruickshank. God Damn. Tell you what, whoever made these odds, men are way off. They need to educate themselves. I get confused sometimes. It's some of the odds. I mean, Adri has made a killing allegedly by, I was a betting man by, uh, some of the things that I sometimes, you know, he'll come to fights and I'll go, whatever you do better

Speaker 2:          01:36:29       fucking hell. He's out Bro. I don't know. Yes, I do know. He's just taking punishment. Oh, he's hanging in there. Gary is close to stopping this fight. That's it. Oh shoot. Oh shoot. Victory. And I would told, watch this setup.

Speaker 5:          01:36:53       Those odds are off. Those odds are off. I text my brother right before we got in and he said, he said he should. I bet on, I said, Detroit superstar. That's a big victory. Who the fuck made him a three and a half to one underdog and a four and a half to one favorite for coke. Some fuck. Who's used to doing an NFL and NBA was like, Oh yeah, I'll do GFC this week. Some guy who doesn't train. That's all that is. That's a guy who doesn't train. Look at this head kick. Watch this.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       Oh, and by the way, Brian caught him with the foot towards Sam writing. Did you and I know the difference. You and I know that Gary stopped the fight because he got tired of being so low. How about the others who's squatting? He gassed out and he's like, I gotta stop this fight. [inaudible] that's that stick legged man. I would have stopped that fight. I gotta be honest with you. You wouldn't have no, no. It wasn't enough. I mean he was definitely in trouble. But look, when Crookshanks on top of him, he's dropping these shots and every time she goes shopping these shots, he's grabbing him. Coke is trying to get up. I mean, he's definitely tagging them, but I don't think I would have stopped that fight because I like to see a guy survived that kind of shit and come back. And I know that sometimes when guys burn themselves out trying to finish a fight, it can like they could gas and just got ourselves here.

Speaker 2:          01:38:08       Stole your can do a back flip on a trampoline on the trampoline. I can't even do it on a tramp fucking, I can't either. I can have a problem. We could have. I took the time. I did gymnastics forever cause I used to hang out with GSP all the time. He did gymnasts. Those I want to be like him. So I started doing gymnastics, then he went back to Montreal bottling it. Worst body for gymnasts. Not really. You got really good. Sorry. I got really good. And then as he's trying to criticize you, he's so tall. Shut down your body for fucking you. You wouldn't get sensitive about your body. That body for gymnastics, by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:38:48       I'm six five, two 50 I'm not really. Yeah, you do. Well, but the one objective kept doing it and then I was getting really tired from it and he's like hurting my knees. I was like, what the fuck am I? What am I doing gymnastics right now? If you tell your needs covered and there's 10 year olds everywhere doing way cooler shit than me, 13 pounds. And I was like, you know what? I should probably be in the gym rolling. I'm at the fuck out of there. I've never been back. Good for you. That's very smart. [inaudible] no one ever want to fight by doing backflips. No, it's the only reason I went so I could do a backflip. I'd be Brian, do you think this, this fight is a fucking interesting fight, right? It's a couple of interesting fights in this card. The me a Dan Henderson is very interesting, but the thing about me and Henderson is like, Henderson is off the TRT now. Trts been banned. They shut that shit. There's a couple of guys who were like, Ah Shit. He Tour Vito. I put out a statement and I feel I'm a beast without TRT. The Holy Spirit. Really? Yeah. He said the Holy Spirit tweeted that out.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       Well I do, but I like seeing guys win at the same time and one of them has to happen for the other to happen and I'm a big fan of Cruickshank get to really, I'm a really big fan.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       it. A let him fight a little bit more because I don't think that any of these shots are putting them away. He's not flat lining. I agree. His head is off the mat and he's trying to make him the route away. He's trying to figure out a way to get out of that scenario. But when the guys on top of you and a guys blown is wildlife that swarming as a guy who's experienced a lot of fights, I think that you got to let a god try to fight out of the bottom position listener. Yay. Yes, because the guy's head, he never laid back. There's his dad. I mean it was dad's karate instructor. What did he have kids?

They kept Elian downstairs and uh, and the informant was talking to you as well. If they, we had a problem, we take them down and see the lion, that's all it was. All we needed for the guy to comply and they just had this huge male lion down. I would imagine that's the last way you'd want to die. Well, the Uday and Qusay whatever who say, yeah, some, a lot about scenes. Kids used to feed sweet up dogs to rottweilers. They was not feed the dogs for days. And then they would throw people to the dogs, including like women that they raped. They would rape women on their wedding day. They would find them on their wedding day, steal them away from their, their groom, raped them, and then feed them to dog William Wallace when that shit was at biggest assholes on the planet.

Was He? He was great. He didn't bangers that was pretty like shooting the shit out on him, right? Yeah. That fucking cunt. She should be boycotted for life by the way.

Speaker 5:          01:53:30       When you guys, when you asked her, you knew she was the one when he met her. Well, she get pregnant. There's some game. Listen, here's the reality. There is no perfect person, not me, not you, not anyone. And it's when you enter into a relationship, it's really all a matter of where are you in your life? Where, what? What are you deciding? What decisions do you make as far as like how you proceed and when, and I've had friends that are like, you know, hey man, I'm thinking about getting married. I'm like, stop. Stop what you're doing right now and understand what you're doing because a marriage, all it is is a legal contract with the state. That means you're going to have kids and you want to have kids. Marriage is all good, but I didn't get married until I had kids. And on that smooth, I'm going to take it. I'm going to have a pickle break right now. Go much. Why am I going if I want to connect to grab, grab hold on. Pickle. Yes. It's that close man. And just so everybody understands, there's nothing wrong with getting married. There's nothing wrong with having kids. Nothing wrong, all those things. But it tends to be the right time and know the right person to, it's gotta be the right fucking, it's gotta be the right scenarios.

[inaudible] funny thing that you do on Instagram. You do have a really interesting thing that you're doing what you do. The splash on the devil. That's fucking hilarious. Really funny man. It's really original to ma'am. Good. I'm going to do, I've got more to come. Well I fucking hope so at least. Ah, Brian's doing this thing where he has a cell phone on one side and the iPad on the other c has two things talking to him at the same time. That is me. I always have a you doing that when you're on the road? Yes. And isn't one like hey fuck guys. Like wait, what? Yeah, the guy. I was like, fuck yeah. Keeps me. Yeah. You have to watch it. Well, this is a broad who was in the broad, this is

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       the girl who's in love with Wayne Newton. Here comes here comes who still knew and we knew their guys excited. Whether that, wait, how does he not know? Buzzes girlfriend? He doesn't know for the same reason why bodybuilders don't know. They look ridiculous or anorexics don't know. The liquid gets a fucking, did they run out of people to sponsor the UFC? Did they not have a guy in the office? Does quality control? It goes enough with the fucking spinning. Na's guy, bro. Real quick. Let's talk about bodybuilding. I think there'd be a game sport. It's guys suck for competitions. I actually went, I had a friend who's competing. This girl competing in one of those. I went to the first time ever guys on guys, right guys? It was the craziest, scariest thing I've ever seen in my life. Wait a minute. Racks on racks, on racks.

Speaker 3:          01:59:30       Guys. Philip, who's Polish muscularity, he's Rasta. Philip, do you know it's interesting. Casa Philip who left ray long goes camp, you know, because he's 185 pounds, most likely Weidman's one 85 they might have to fight. I don't know what all the drama was. Do you, do you know anything? Um, but since then he's is not looked as good as last. His last two against Luke Rockhold and Francis Karma. I uh, on my last fight with [inaudible] UFC one 65, me and him shared a locker room. I'm not making this up. This guy did maybe half a jumping jack and went out and fought no warmup. Zero. Look at, I'm not a sweat out sweat. He does not warm up. He didn't hit Mitts, he didn't do anything. He did kind of this half ass jumping. Jack goes, let's roll. And here I am sweating my ass off in the back, getting ready.

Speaker 3:          02:00:22       Look at this fight because he's fighting Lorens Larkin. And my take on this is that Larkin is like a really multifaceted striker. It goes a lot of kit, very tricky, very tricky. But Phillip, who is almost exclusively a boxer, he's like a sprawl boxer type care. And he's been getting taken down a lot lately. That's how he's been losing his fights. What Carmona really kind of tricked him. I don't think he ever saw that coming. I think he's on the call it up though, because Karma is GSP. GSP is running double the differences. Phillip, who has crazy knockout pyre? Larkin's really not known. Does he though does fill up whoever you crazy knockout mouse. Who is he knocked out? Who's the last guy who knocked out though? Uh, just see his fight with Jared Haman. Oh Man. Talk about brain damage. Really not fun to watch.

Speaker 3:          02:01:08       These are my new favorite pickles. I can't get enough of these pickles. I don't feel good. I'm a little lightheaded, but I'm eating the shit out. These big goals. It might be the bulletproof coffee. There's no, she's pickles with the fucking, it's the perfect storm to shit your pants. 30 seconds people. I blocked five guys who complained about me chewing pickles. By the way, are we allowed to ask? I know you guys don't make predictions, but if you had to put your money on the silver Brown fight, can I get, can I get a call? Which fine. On the seventh round main event. The main want to wait for the main event? Yeah. No, I like Matt Brown. I don't like the fact that Eric Silver is a big, uh, a big, he's two to one. Who makes these odds. Crazy eyes. Fuck. Do we do it?

Speaker 3:          02:01:49       Math four fights in a row. All knockouts. Eric Silva's one one seven fights in a row as it is. It? No, it's four for whatever it is. Um, I'm always impressed with him. You might, you might be right on seven. Maybe it's four knockouts in a row. I'm not unimpressed with Eric Silver. I think Eric's Silva's a fucking, I think Matt Brown spot tougher guys. But don young good knocked him out and that makes me, uh, not that don young calves out and animal. He is here at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, six in a row. Fulfill, fulfill the 44 knockouts in a row, right? Yeah. His last loss was so proud of him and a good team. Either way. Oh, you just got tagged Phillip. Who's tired of losing man? He was ranked, what? Six at one point he was up there. He's a beast.

Speaker 3:          02:02:38       He's so strong. His leg would imagine he is strong. His legs are insane. Look at his calves. They ain't giving those muscles way in a cracker jack box. You know what I'm saying, folks? You know what I'm saying? Not that'd be me as a, as a, as a the kids creek, he's got to go tease balls. Good leg kicked by Larkin in there and Larkin used to fight two oh five right? Yeah. Do you don't lock in as a win over Robbie Lawler? Do you know that and striking? You look good. Oh good. In that Robbie Lawler, man, he's really clean as far as like as tech and you know what? In Strikeforce he was a, he was a killer. I think the UFC was, I don't see a big jump, but it's different. Strikeforce and UFC or different. He's, he's stumbled a little bit in the UFC so far are conceives a very can be, just hasn't gotten current combos.

Speaker 3:          02:03:23       The haircuts freaking me out kid and play kind of thing going on in the eighties back stop. What about vittores? Vittores haircut. I'm a fan. I am too. I like, I like them in cornrows and I let them in and we were see towards white face and make it what beautiful woman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's, he's a named mark cart to train with him. His wife came and I was like, he's a fucking, you don't spit it back if I can stare at it or I will eat a spinning back kick to the face and, and uh, ooze classic. He's getting hot chick dual Larkin and the truck hit Costa Philip who are thrown. He's got beautiful kids, right? They look like x men. All of them. Yup. Beautiful. Both of these guys have their back up against the wall. Oh, big kicked by. Largan. See that's a different gene.

Speaker 3:          02:04:13       Larkin is the kicking techniques. I mean Philip who threw a kick but missed, but Larkin is real clean boots. Going to counter when these kicks with a big right hand who maybe, it's funny how it's used a little more active than this. These Kickstarter started like they start changing like what becomes a trend now? Everybody is throwing those oblique kick copied copycat league. Tony Man. Yeah that front kick Anderson does now everyone does it. Everyone does it. We'll kicks everyone wheel kicks. That's a cool thing. Superman Punch was the thing like a denim jacket. Oh about two months ago. I'm wondering waiting for body shots. Look body punches to be like God, that's it. No you're fighting a high level striker that he's gone to the body. If he's comfortable gone the body by Philip boot. Oh it's coming back right counter one of those kicks. Hey who am I? We got ourselves a fight here.

Speaker 3:          02:05:07       I want to say that you took it out of her own. We tagged them. Taking the wind out of my sails wasn't gentleman. These guys are sweating where his cost of Phillies guys strong cause you still training on Long Island? Yeah, he's still on the east coast. I know that. And his managers. Lex Mcmahon. One of the best in the business that Catherine plants her. Um, is there anybody that would ever fight with an implant? You imagined dudes. That's the number one. Number one implant for guys, his calves. I'm weird. You think they'd have a Dick Implant by now? They do. How do you know? I don't want to talk about it in Africa. They so rocks in there sometimes. Yeah. Say what you fucking with me and the entire continent. Oh, lucky. Went Down Phil Pool. Huge win for holy Shit. Yeah. Some tribes. I don't know why.

Speaker 3:          02:06:00       I have another picked on that Dude Phillip, who he's got, he is jacked. He is sweat and Brian, he's jacked. Wow. That was a big women. Here's, here's my felt. This got some muscle lost. His last two man, he needed that one had to do or die and not, not only that, I think you might've been the first guy to ever stop. Lorens Larkin is tracked for us or the UFC. Look at him. He's fucking wobbled, ma'am. A lot of power, right? Remember I said a lot of power. You're talking shit. Boom, boom. Oh, clean, bright, happy. She's got short. That right hand is he hit his head up. Folks at home, when you watch how short he threw that punch, let's call it the tower that's called power is power. It's technique because he didn't wind up and pull it way back before he launched it.

Speaker 3:          02:06:44       And that's why it landed in the first place. And so people got understand donk. Oh, beautiful box. And that was a beautiful right hand. There's, you're knocked out hard left hook. And here's a right hand cod donk. Dot. Dunkel oh, look at that. Lumped it curd underneath his ear. What is that? That's not even a bone. So you know how Joe Silva, you'll see him in the ring when he congratulates guys, what did he say to you? Well, if he's unhappy with their fight, he doesn't come in the ring. Even if, right. If he's happy comes in and says like, great job. Has He ever seen on the weird to you something like, you're my idol. I was like, come on. That's true. Really never. How you doing Bryan County? Just a liar. He's your cock is big as I hope my Lavar Johnson fight. When I just kept taking them down, beat were booing me. I was like, Yo, where's

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       Joe Head? I won my fight when the bank, you just walked right pass and I was like, yeah, but that's what you gotta do when you're fighting Lavard Johnson. That guy's ridiculous. What I want on the scale and I'm like, I turned my coaches, I think he's on steroids and was like, Nah, you're the same size. I was like, I look like him. Like yeah. I'm like, Oh fuck. Yeah. I was in the hotel, the hotel taking selfies. I asked him to chicks and then after the fight my coach can, good Lord, that guy was way bigger and way. Fuck man. He's like, we just want to say that so you weren't so scared and he tested positive for steroids. Steroids is fucking hilarious. You wear a panty behind live t by 15 seconds behind live TV, which was asked for that. I got in the clinch with him.

Speaker 2:          02:08:27       I was like, this is not snowflake. This is not stuff like, oh, the Internet is behind by, he was just ridiculous. A strong, so folks, if you're watching this and you're like, you're behind, it's because of the Internet. So back you fucking Tivo up by 15 seconds. And by the way, if you don't have Tivo, go fuck your mother. All right. Fuck your mother. Fucking people have to walk. I was at a friend's house. They don't even have a DVR. I'm like, why not use candles? Why not live in the guy told me, how much do we a message by pigeon. Alright, yeah, send it over to stand with a good friend and a, you know, their family. My family friends and I saw that they had, uh, they had the channel where glory was on the head spike. I was like, oh perfect. I'll just watch it on the DVR.

Speaker 2:          02:09:14       I'm like, Whoa, what is this? Where's your, where's your fucking Dvr? I'll try to pause their TV. I can't pause it. What the fuck is happening? What am I living in a different time? Do you guys have steam powered machines? Philip was interviewing himself. That's not true. They don't look anything alike, but the joke they do chose may do. What does his shirt, there were tea with a backwards torque. Dawn do it. What? Whoever made that shirt stop was going to say it doesn't stop. Kind of confusing. If you want to get your name out there just like that. With this going to confuse the fuck out of people. I'm confused right now. Costa Philip, who's a good guy, man, I'm, I'm happy for him. He too went into, listen, I've lost two in a row. That third fight is so stressful. It's not even funny because guess what? You lose you going back to fricking dancing, shaking your ass for guys white and a man.

Speaker 2:          02:10:20       You're back at Starbucks. My balls so sweat. You lose. If you had a high level and you lose two in a row and you're getting paid decent, that third one, you better win. Otherwise you're getting your pink slip. He was under a lot of pressure. Is that like a hard rule or is that just kind of informal? Depends on the guy. It depends what you're getting paid. Yeah. That's a weird thing. If you have like a good contract, like there's certain guys that come in and they're like highly touted and they lose a couple of fights in a row, 400 g's and you lose two in a row. UFC, he's like, Huh, what are we doing? But if they're fun fights, if it's an exciting fighting, you're fighting top level guys. Oh, look at that fucking right hand. That's beautiful. Tell you why. Losing two fights that third fight, most stressful fight of my career. I've been in the UFC a long time. Quite a while. Beautiful combination. That left hook right hand that's short right hand. Why I told you he's a fucking knock our arms, Bro. That's right. I said what happened to flight in the kid podcasts available centered on Fox.

Speaker 2:          02:11:21       Oh, they must have listened to me telling them you're going to leave the fucking offering you guys to come over to hire primate.com for free. We've got Travis Barker right on Wednesday. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah, he is. He knows a lot about finding. Yeah. Seems like a good dude too. You know what, man, if he's one of the nicest people I've ever met, he's so nice. You know when you meet someone, the show nights, you think they want something from you? Like, what do you want me to see my Dick? Or something like, what do you, what do you want to ride in my call? Whether that's your first option. You must want to see my Dick. Well, why is he so friendly? Nice. Yeah. Cool man. Just start taking my clothes off. I don't know what's going on, right? I guess this is what you want.

Speaker 2:          02:12:06       Oh, I'm not used to it. When he was on pump two, he was on punked with Ahmed Ahmed. Ahmed. Ahmed. Ahmed was talking crazy shit to him in a restaurant and he was like, come on. What the fuck it, let's go outside. He likes, he's a rockstar. He's ready to drag someone outside of fight with them, Bro. That dude's cardio is insane. Really. Jim, he does like 12 rounds in a row. Just submits, moving insane drums to do the best drummer in the world. Drums are a lot of cardio, man. Hey, hey, hey bro. Calm down about the best drummer in the world, but, but I understand who's the best drama for sure. For sure. Calm down. Don't know, cause I'm not a drummer expert, but I imagine fucking Neil Perch. Got Something to say. Who's Neil? Perts drama for rush. Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          02:12:59       It's fucking pot. Yeah. 85 and has a grape nuts. Hang down on the drums. Hey Bro, guys, Neil Peart is probably the, I tell you what, Google best drummers. I just did best drummer in the world. Okay, Neil Peart according to you. Fuck you Jay, Bro. Fuck guest. You don't get to say James, James, James, James. There's a lot of people that believe in different things. The sparker is definitely one of the best of all time. Uh, you're out of your fucking mind. Okay. Brian, what's your p's and q's to understand that you're out of your mind and I've had to take you serious and Neil Peart from rush is on this. What I just looked up, John Bonham from led Zeppelin is number two. I am writing Chad Smith, red hot chili peppers. Number three. Why? You know when they say still alive, it's like is I'll lead the greatest boxers still alive because I'm pretty sure that Vladimir Klitschko would fuck him up right now.

Speaker 2:          02:14:00       Ryan would fuck them. Point well put. Well put. Yeah. I mean there's a current drummers Travis brown still look at and we'll get [inaudible] fucking drum set. I think of that. Any more questions Brendan? Shop but doesn't know anything about drumming. Travis Barker. I take drum lessons. Brian, you're 57 you don't know when they have to is. You have no idea. I've never heard of that. That band, Travis Barker can drive upside down. I'm pretty sure Travis parks a bad motherfucker. I will slap you right and I talked back. Collins is in here. Joey Jordan. A lot of people think who is he from? Do we have from young? From a slipknot Korn. Okay. Rob Zombie is another one that folks consider to be number one. Yeah, whatever. I believe the guy from the Allman brothers, Gregg Allman, who is it? Who played the drums, I believe notes might be the best in oats, which, oh, by the way, I'll tell you who's a better looking guy than there.

Speaker 2:          02:15:03       Then a big brown Brendan shop and that would be Mr. Silva Silva fear. He's got his throwing fucking waiver throwing for a hair. I am looking forward to this fight. The only thing that I can hope is that this fight goes five fucking rounds. Got Beautiful Hair. Really? I wanna see I wanna I don't wanna. I don't want it to be a quick one. One because they can't get enough pick. If I was a betting man, I would have bet on the over on this fight. I'm just saying I just can't hold. The three arrows were one and a half. I can't believe that all of is the for one and a half minus one 50 people. If you're out doing, if it goes over to go over one and a half. Yeah, that's how much you get for that. It was minus one 50 so you have to give away a little bit, but it's still, I think there's a pretty good chance. I would tell you to bet the fucking farm on that man. Brendan, did you train with the Michael Bisbing? Yes. Recently. On a Tuesday. How's his eye? Good. Okay. Your Voice was too active to hire folks at home and not going to get into. That was a weird pause cause he went good.

Speaker 2:          02:16:09       It seemed good. He team, we were sparring. He's going hard with a heavy weight. I tell you what, it was our warmup round. He came at me like a banshee. Are we show video here, chairman? By the way, here's the trivia questions. What is a banshee? But don't look it up yet. What's it been a banshee? Uh, let's a band shit like, gosh, it's an avenging spirit. Not Bad. What's it Bangy. It's a, a very upset spirit. Fucking liar. Some shit that screams that doesn't fancy. It's such shit. The little kids believe is real. A banshee, I believe and I think is a, an Irish, Irish, very of mischief. Please look it up. Why are you trying to like gain Brownie pans from the oxalic acid debacle? Sorry, go the stupidest facts of all time. Oxalic acid. Once you go make me some fucking juice. Hey Bro. Yeah, Brian, that's when they'll come back. I went, Hey Brian. I had no comment. What about the toxins? The other toxins, the toxins in fucking leafy Greens will kill you. Feel Great. I'll tell you what they are. They're oxy there. I'm fucking chlorine.

Speaker 2:          02:17:23       Nick [inaudible] color farts. What's wrong with you? Really? What is wrong? I am a lawyer. I say things for attention. We don't like looking things up cause it's a bore. Who are you? I just work on instinct. You fuck. It's hard to blue. When did Brian just drop all this stuff? You stopped doing combat sports. You stopped juicing. You played tennis juice in my life, but I will. I'll start. Oh, juicing. I thought you meant choosing this truce. I drink a, I have a press juices delivered to my house every day. That's gangster. God, it's so good. You were right. Very good. Banshee's a fairy woman who begins to whale. If someone is about to die, don't be fucking my boy. Aubrey. Just don't fuck with no Joe. He doesn't say shit unless he knows what he's talking about. Is very different. No wonder you in that respect.

Speaker 2:          02:18:13       No wonder if Aubrey doesn't know he's got this crazy thing he does. He goes, I don't know. You should try it. Brian makes the block that I love that. I don't know. That's a boring, just trying to ask me any questions. You can answer it. Don't be scared. Try to, I now if somebody has somebody has their hood open in that car, I'll come over and give him by giving him nothing about car. I literally will come over and go find a ranch on the side of the road and pick it up and see if it fits. You. Check the fucking a carburetor. You have distributor caps, disturb your calves cause she fucking, how's the HVAC valve on that? This is a big fucking fight from Matt Brown and for Eric Silva. Look at this. Here's the rankings. See, okay. Matt Brown, rank number seven. Eric Silva, not even on the fucking top 10 for Internet. They have him as a two to one favorite. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:19:07       Look at how tough. Look at that shit. Crazy feels holding. That's also why allegedly Aubrey has made a shit fuck ton of money. Yes. There you go. On my advice, allegedly, what is the percentage? Allegedly like 80% allegedly it'd be, hold on, hold on. Hold on. One fight where allegedly we won 10 out of 11 so you allegedly talked to Joe Rogan before you put money allegedly Callahana for only certain ones. I go bet they'll fucking farm on Tyron Woodley allegedly. Hey Bro, this certain ones, those tips. Yeah, I will, but you won't bet. You'll go to a buddy who was used to be a navy seal. He gave me contrary advice. I wanted to make him happy, so I showed him my slips. I held him. I have a friend, hey, let's hear this. This

Speaker 5:          02:19:56       breakdown. Oh, it's me. How convenient. This is a fucking great fight, man. Really good fight. Well, I'd love just Matt Brown for a little bit. Hurt his back. Yeah, that's what's I'm, I'm interested in this. He nodded. Not just hurt his back. You fucking herniated discs. We had to pull out of a big fight. You're supposed to fight condit cold out and herniated discs are not something that heals up real quick, man. You know, I know. I, I, I had, um, you know, it took me a long fucking time of a lot of different types of therapies to deal with. Uh, my, uh, bulging disc that I had. You know what's weird is, is Matt Brown, he came to Denver to train with us one time and I was like, oh, this pacing would be insane watching him spar Neil Magni nope. Nope. It's a different, like his octagon pace.

Speaker 5:          02:20:55       And is sparring paces completely different? Well, it probably should just putting in work, you know, he's probably smart about that and that sense. Was He, um, was he with Beecher? Yes. Yeah. Beach is a good dude, man. A really good dude. Features have got to turn me onto my tattoo artist. Oh, really? Who's your tattoo artist? Aaron Dellavedova from grew tattoo in San Diego. Great fucking guy. Do you have to go down to San Diego? San Diego. He, um, he did a, I talked to Beecher. I was like, who did your fucking sleeve? Yeah. He's like, Karen DeSalvo over the guy's fucking awesome. He gave me his number. I called the guy guys cool as shit. I saw stuff online and it was worth it for me. Do you have both? Just your arms. Both guys are Erindale widow and has your back and chest onto, oh, nothing's done. But these just arms.

Speaker 5:          02:21:40       Both sleeves. Both done by the same guy. He's awesome. I want to get, I want to get just one sleeve. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did too. But I had this uh, idea to do this. Me and Moto Musashi sleeve. Oh. It was kind of important to me, so I said fuck it. That's book of five rings. I love that. But yeah. Oh, we'll get Eric Silva slapping himself before Matt Brown does their pro there. Press poster for this fight. It was pretty fucking epic. Pretty towns. Yeah. They're pretty intense dudes, man. Yeah man. It's like the young lion versus the established line. Cool. How old is this kid killer? He's young. I mean, I don't think he's holding than 25 I think he is. Is He? Hold on. I want to say he's 27 or 28 okay, let's pull it up. Eric Silva.

Speaker 5:          02:22:32       I feel like he didn't feel like he made Bieber was separated at birth. One went to Brazil, right? He's, he's actually 29 29 yeah. Wow. I guess I'm pro basing it on how old he was. He looks 20 words. You look 21 looks 21 yeah. I kind of forget that guy's age. The answer the UFC at Leesville Eg. Oh, look at him. Ishmael. His last name is Ishmael. Ishmael lead. Gee, that guy, he rides one of those little crotch rockets and he takes him to Aziz. Oh yeah, he does. He's a serious to some end goals out here. Yep. Yeah. He's to work out and goes all the time though. He's still doctor. Great Guy. I saw him the other day. Guy, original Carlson, Gracie black belts. He is choked. Hoists Gracie unconscious in Rio on the beach. That was a community fucking heads out, didn't he?

Speaker 5:          02:23:22       Didn't he beat Hendo as well? Jujitsu match. You might be right. Yup. It might be bright. Believe he did. He's a serious guy. He's a tank that was back when, uh, there was the rivalry, you know, the Carlson Gracie rivalry with Elios kids. The Leo side and this hall is rivalries. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's a family. Even the family like holy [inaudible] criticizes Henner and he ran for doing the grace university. Like I don't get that criticism man. I really don't. A lot of guys think that you can't have Jujitsu instructions online. Of course you can. Is it as good as being there in person? No, it's not. Is it still good? Yes, it is still bakes Jujitsu available to a lot of people. Can't get to the, I have a buddy lives in Kentucky, man. He lives in the middle of fucking nowhere and him and his buddies, they watch videos and they practice together and that's all he has.

Speaker 5:          02:24:15       He's like two hours away. You can simply get better that way. But that's how rich Franklin learned. Hey, you got a lot of guys learned like that man Tanner Bas Rutten's said he was, he'd been beginning of kind of self taught. Well, he definitely learned a lot of grappling that way. Not Striking. He's also just a gorilla is pos. How about, how about when he was doing like just demonstrating shit for us? My God, let's just like he's getting Regena keen done at the same place where I get mine done on his arm, on his neck. He's got a real problem though. Here's for folks at home, man. Here's the thing that my doctor told me. Once you start getting um, numbness and then you start getting atrophy, if you don't catch that shit quick, you have a small window where your nerves have the possibility that he just stumbled there and slipped. That scares me. He ripped his fucking knee right there and then played it off. Um, you, you have a small window when you, uh, when you lose muscle and size and you start atrophying, it's only a couple of months he said, and in those couple of months, if you don't get surgery or they don't get something that reduces the pressure on the nerves, those nerves can die off and then you never get them back to you and there's nothing you can do. So it never comes back 100%. Never.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       Cause Bas Rutten was telling me, you know, he was trying all these different things to get his nerves back, but it's a long fucking time. It's been years. He's got this massive atrophy on his right arm. Like boss had neck problems all the way back that to the tea Yoshiko Osaka fight. When he won the UFC heavyweight title couldn't wrestle training for that fight. Same Shit is Carwyn had like serious neck injuries and couldn't fucking wrestle. And so then I think it was sons of anarchy was doing stunts for the, he fell on his head. It's spiked on his neck and he's like [inaudible] fucking pain. Herniated disc in the neck, atrophy of the nerves like the whole deal. But boss is just such an animal. He's like one of those guys that like if he gets injured, he just sucks it up and keeps working out. He's the one, the original filers who was a freak athlete just picked up things so fast.

Speaker 1:          02:26:16       He was one of the best strikers in the early days, asking strictly how would boss do nat who have the old guys. I know you can't ask that because we're so involved. The whole hall comes out. The day that it's evolved. I tried to do the Bas Rutten jumping double kick on the trampoline all the time. It's totally useless unless you're in a movie. Hence the trampoline and two dummies are running at you. I would imagine Matt Brown said to a super high pace, being in some townies would come out pretty amped up. Well, it's also a big question like how, how much time is he had to fix that back? You got to remember this is five rounds, so that patient, there's no way you can do it for five rounds. Just can't, I don't know. You know, I don't know what his injury was like, but I know that like Matt Serra, when he came back from herniating, a disk in his back and he fought GSP, he was really not the same.

Speaker 1:          02:27:06       It was really not the same. And most guys, when they injure a disc in their back, you're back is a lot like your knee, which is a lot like your brain. You know when, that's a good analogy like a guy doesn't understand what a brain injury is like when you get owed and then you get CalEd again easily afterwards. It's just like tweaking a knee and you rip it the ligament and then you get it fixed but then you need is always kind of sore, you know. Well when you hurt your back though that's so different cause it's connecting your nerves back injury? I don't think so because I've never seen Nate except I guess a brain trauma. I mean but I've never seen anything as far as like a mixed martial arts related injury that can just end it. Backer that yeah, back or neck and end it and your, your arms shrivel your leg show. I have a friend and he had two back surgeries and for whatever reason it didn't take and his leg is, he has one leg that's shriveled. His, his right calf is like a bone to heal and he's super self conscious about it. He like wear sweat pants, he won't wear shorts and he's all fucked up about it. He's hoping it comes back, but the reality is if it's more than a certain amount of time, it ain't coming back. It's tough. And so if you're out there and you got any sort of an injury,

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       fucking don't tough it out. Deal with it, deal with it immediately. Go get it. Prolo to fuck. Yap. Prolotherapy prolozone had probably therapy on my neck and I worked for me. Yeah, no he didn't. Yes, you had a neck problem, man. Yeah. Join digits here and I had a showering. No, I had told I really did. I pull it in therapy and they shot him. They shoot. Um, I think a saline solution in your next Chicago, whatever it is. And it worked. Ooh, that sounds intense. Oh boy. This is a nose to nose. Exactly the same height about to kiss good. Soft there he goes matter. It doesn't matter. No. You know what's interesting about Matt Brown and like he doesn't move that fluidly. Like if you looked at the way he moves his strikes and everything like that, you wouldn't like there's certain guys, you look at them like perfect example, Hector Lombard. You look at a move and you go, Oh, fucking Christ. See this place. Leave this space now. That just super kick. He was kissing guys. Fuck down. Spacious. Maybe with his back, he might just let them take them. Boom. Oh boy. Oh boy. Pulls him over on top. This is what I'm telling him of time at the high pace. Charged up home crowd, body kit.

Speaker 5:          02:29:40       Brown breaks. Motherfuckers too. Does Ooh, good body kick. But he's sold like Eaton shots and comes back. He's not a front runner, man. Big liver kick. Oh No fucking hurt, man. Don't stop it. He's not. He's not locked out. Oh He's, he's gonna Survive. He'll survive. But look at this. [inaudible] Silva's got his back. He's got to work that defense. But you know if you can get ahold of a glove, this is a good little break right here. If you get two on one, you're pretty safe. Oh, this is just a neck crank here. How about zero on one hand? No. Why does it need turn into the choke turned turned towards his right. He doesn't have body triangle either. He might be taking a little break you as long as it take to recover from a kick, like that tight body kick. You're in trouble for a while.

Speaker 5:          02:30:25       It depends entirely on how bad and where. God George me and dropped him with a fucking body shot and he hit him with a vicious body. Punched 200 201 I was trying to get to the right of it. This is great. Back control sort of, but he's got his legs crossed. If Matt Brown steps over that and he could make it at least let him make his legs uncomfortable. He doesn't have his legs crossed again. But then like when Hixon choked out food knocky he has legs cross too, but Hickson, I am worried about that shit. Come on. Oh he's got a deep now. Shit. Nope. Oh boy. It's just a neck crank. Ope. If it fits under the shoulder. What's he doing? Oh man, that is a neck fucking Kremlin. It's not under the neck.

Speaker 8:          02:31:07       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:31:08       It's under the Chin there you go to o two on one for the love of God. Defend your, it's such a weird thing is to find your body triangle, but he's not rolling dot. Not Rolling towards the triangle. Now. He's not a good thing. Now he's doing a good thing. See how he's, you know, I see. You got to tap once from an arm bar from that position. He got two on one on a guy's arm and then extended it against is exhausting for him though right now, right? It's Eric silver or from Africa or if I'm at Brown. Yeah, but Matt Brown was getting bad. That was he. Yeah, he's tough. He's tough. He's tough. Yup. The UFC fighters. Pretty tough. Hey, you calm down back there. We've tracked up though. He trapped this right arm that's dirty, fucked up and I was going to take that other handout.

Speaker 5:          02:31:54       You've got it back. This is very nerve wracking. We've got two minutes left, but she know what Matt Brown, he relishes these kinds of fights. Man Goes to the second round. This is a lot of shit, but Eric Silva tried several times to exert a lot of energy to try to finish him and what he's trying to trap that arm again. You see how his heel, his heels blocking his arm from coming in and he's out. He's out. Oh boy. Oh Shit. Here comes the Nissan. Oh, there it goes. One of the body. The body shot was great and there's an elbow and another need of the body and this is Eric's Silva.

Speaker 2:          02:32:30       He my God, Matt, Matt Brown has Robo is coming coming on, man. All that exertion. This is a kid that wilted against John Fitch. The same sort of scenario. Brown does not stop coming. This pace is got Brian. Keep making comments versus guys in total wars. Oh Man. Oh I'm sorry. I can't help it. Huc Site. What? These guys sweat a lot guys. These guys are all muscle. There's no fat on a minute and 20 seconds in my no bullshit aside. This is crazy crazy. The crowd. He's rugged, rugged. This is exactly what I keep your hands up, man. Keep your hands up. Please. Fuck. Keep his hands up. Oh.

That's about to break and my 45 fucking seconds is a long time. We get beat on. Ooh, that's more tied to, that's that Muay Thai dump. Oh Man. He's all over this. He kicked him in the head kick. No, Jesus Christ. Last thing you want to see this? This is fight fucking stopped on a DQ. Oh Dude. Silva's exhausted. Look at him walking away. Don't do that. He can't even pick his legs up to hick. Somebody calling out. It's crazy, Matt Brown trout has. That's crazy. Oh, that's crazy. For your morale. Oh, cut. Drags dues into hell, man. I want it to get to. Oh boom. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:34:05       Wow. Please let this fight. Keep going. You guys didn't even better, dude. He run down one does it half rounds. Are you kidding? Clearly give that round to Matt. Right? Wow. God Damn. Let me see the replays that, wow, this is a commercial for light. Fuck nigger wearing a wig. It's commercial thousand times that came out like a banshee. Arlo can play some ping pong. He actually his peer legs on. You haven't seen me play ping pong. I'd actually kind of like Matt Brown and Pink Pong is anybody like suffered less from fucking their housekeeper and getting her pregnant and then oral. He's the greatest. He went right into that to several chai.

Speaker 2:          02:34:55       I don't think I'm speaking actually ask for enough loose some about that and he goes like this. I go, what did you do? And he goes, just laid low. I swear to God. I go, what did you do when that happened? Because he was going to do a movie where he has a Spanish lover and they said, look, you know it's probably not a good idea. And I go, what did you do with that? I just laid low. Yeah, he is a remarkable vision of what, what's going on. It's kind of like he's kind of a macho, he can't hear me. Here's the replay. So this is the gate. Oh my God. And you see him tighten up. Boom. Brown is all over silver. That's the thing about Matt Brown. You can't blow your wad on this motherfucker cause he relishes. He'll look at us. He relishes.

Speaker 2:          02:35:37       Ward kept this pace. Two and a half minutes, boys, come on, you can make it so not brown. It's fired it around and a half and you uh, you, you win the bet. I don't think you're probably still was going to wait to make it Silva's getting fucking fuck stop. He's going to have to hurt Matt Brown. I mean, I'm assuming you can kick. You need to take down. You need to take, that's same. Kicky fuck. Sato up with his last opponent. Oh, both a little fatigued. How could you not? Well, I mean Matt Brown just ate another liver kick. He throws that whole, Oh God, this kid will drag you in a fucking hell man. Take him down short elbows to got to love it. He's got a really weird strength and conditioning program to what does it feel to five minute rounds like holding a hundred pound ball.

Speaker 2:          02:36:32       I got to get, can I get my fucking kettlebells please? You guys just got to get the edit the address. You write it down in that yellow sheet workout equipment at home. I'm getting a Matte Brown Tattoo. I'll tell you that much. What would a Mel Brown Tattoo be? It's going to be, it gets going to on my entire torso and my back. Would it be him? Oh Man. Oh, this dude is just shots. Silver tried to trip him. This could be it. How much more time you need to admit it. I got it. You need to take down for, I think the kid might last a minute. Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling that you graze the head all that hair. Oh my God. He's all done. Silva's tough though. There's no way this kid's last in five minutes. I'll tell you that.

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       I agree. He's exhausted and he's not going to win and he's not going to last. He just not going to at this point. Look at that. Who? He's exhausted. He's exhausted. The only thing that's keeping them up right now, his heart and will, does Sylvia have a huge wake up call? Beauty is, yes he does. Yes he does. So he's a big guy. I've seen him walk around outside the octagon in between fights and I was like, Geez. Nasty. Very nasty. You Know Matt Brown's only upper body workout he does for his arm. Oh, he kicked him again. Delivered Kick Matt Reynolds. He does. He does dumbbell presses. And that's it. By the way, silver can take off.

Speaker 6:          02:37:54       Oh,

Speaker 5:          02:37:57       his poor liver. Incredible. Well, he might have a broken rib. I mean, if he's getting hurt that easy. Beautiful takedown inside controls.

Speaker 6:          02:38:05       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:38:09       man. Damn mounted crucifix. He better get an energy. Are you going to stop the fight here but crucifix him. Just keep that. Well, I'll tell you what, Matt Brown also has a very good fucking ground game to a lot of people don't respect that ground game. His ground games nasty. I got to, I mean if he can step over this. Oh No, no, no. Oh my God. Oh Man. Oh boy. You attack the arm. What do you call that? The fuck out. Inverted triangle. Yeah. Yeah. That's a bad position for other way though. That's, that's hell. He needs to attack that. How is silver breathing right now? He goes, nope, he loves a wild fucking fight, man. This is what I love about Matt Brown fights. They're wild. Did you never see a boring, oh, he's done. The kids done. He just, he can't, he can't defend. Look at his left arm.

Speaker 5:          02:38:59       It's like, it's just floating around there. He's not doing anything. He's just hoping to get a break. It's like a dark dark from the mount, but he's like, oh my goodness, this is going to be it. Yeah. This kid's not getting out of the mouth. Really. Not leaving anything though. Yeah, but Eric Silva doesn't have anything left. Look good. You know, I love Herb Dean in these situations because her, look how closely and calmly herb Dean's looking at this. He's not freaking out. And I like how he took a knee so his legs don't burn out like the Big Guy, Huh?

Speaker 6:          02:39:32       Oh, oh,

Speaker 5:          02:39:37       holy shit. Matt Brown is he locked up? He locked up the triangle. So I was in trouble. How seleg he's attacking me arm to keep attacking the arm. The arm is the shit, but he also needs to hook that leg that, you know he'd been, that leg is important. Oh my God. It's fucking hard coming up. If you had bet, if you had bit the over for two rounds, you'd be having a goddamn heart attack right now on that is going can get us back for them to this round. Nope. 20 seconds is fucking fight is incredible. Just needs to attack the body. I feel sorry for the people that are watching us online that are 15 seconds behind

Speaker 2:          02:40:24       cause we're like, we're talking, I mean one of the fight could be over. This is pause your DVR. You fucks. Stay with us. My 15 second talk about a main of wow being inspired. What are we doing? I got to go.

Speaker 5:          02:40:43       Oh my God. This is incredible. What a fucking fight for our best fight. I remember saying, Hey Michael Bisbing eye. Let's go back to this cause we're maturing rounds. Um, it's good. Is it all right? Is it all right? Yeah. Yeah. Damn Dude. Maybe the worst.

Speaker 2:          02:41:01       Don't ever try to go in an acting role when we're smart and good.

Speaker 5:          02:41:07       Did it seem good? It's like one of them is dark. Yeah. He's looking at me like, let's not talk about this. All right. I'll let this go. I'm going to, yeah. He wouldn't ask if I asked him. He wouldn't tell me. You know. When are you going to do, he's a tough motherfucker. He's having problems too. He's got a weak arm. Really? Same thing. Yeah. Pinched nerves here on your boy here on the same issue. I know I haven't wrote, well I wrote with you on last week for the first time in about six months because he's had a neck issue. Yeah. How's he doing now? Is he better? Yeah. What did he do to get better? He saw some specialists in Beverly Hills. Oh yeah. What the guy tell him? I'm not sure

Speaker 5:          02:41:51       what a fucking fight this is so far. I want to see that dig into the body. There it is. Out of nowhere. He heard them. I mean Matt Brown was coming on strong. Here we go. Round three bitches throw to the body. This is a, this is a matter of whether or not Eric Silva has that second wind in them. You know, these mother fuckers that caught all this incredible weight, it catches up with the right [inaudible] in this kind of a fight because Matt Brown is not a big guy. He's not cutting a shit ton of weight. He's not a 200 pound roll. Oh Man. He's just breaking motherfuckers piss break in her way. Oh God, this is awesome.

Speaker 5:          02:42:33       Oh, spinning back fist and he's just constantly on you. You never get a break. There's no rest. There's no break, no risk. Your heart rate's consequently would fucking love to see fight Matt Brown, Nick Diaz. I think that might be the greatest fight in the history of the universe. You might be really back, oh my God, Matt Brown versus Nick Diaz might be the greatest match up of all the holes that go down. I don't know. I don't know. Just chaos. Just pure chaos. Well, you know, Diaz is not, he's not a guy that's gonna wilt like Eric Silvis. I think this kid, I think there's a lot of people that do great and training and they do great when they're not cutting the weight and then they cut the weight and they think they're going to be okay, but they don't take into account that diminished effect that it has on your body.

Speaker 5:          02:43:21       I mean, it has a big effect on your body when you're in a war like this, you really shouldn't be fighting a fucking guy like this at 170 pounds. You don't football games when it gets to the overtime, when they go, this is a war of nutrition, not bitch for real. They never say nutrition, nutrition, nutrition. The pub we gave. I gotcha. I gotcha. I hear you, but this podcast, I'd probably let that go if this wasn't on the Internet. Browse on top of them. Fucking Eric Silva. There's a cut now though. Now they're going to look to stop. That was mixing up. Where's the blood? Eric's Elvis bleed. He's not, he's not protecting himself. Do you stop it now or now? Nope. No. Herb Dean. We'll give them some chances, man. He's pushing off a little bit with his feet, his feet, but that's it. That's Eddie.

Speaker 5:          02:44:09       He turtled up. He gave up. Wow. Matt Brown. Fuck you odds makers. You pitches were wrong twice. I'd make yourself look at and look at that kind of chuckling. Dell outfit was hell. It's good. Look at Eric Silverman beaten down. That motherfucker broke him. Matt Brown is up. He is a fucking beast. A great fight. Holy Shit. That was fun. Joe Silva doing it. He's in the ring and he'd like to fight takes. We know the facts. We know the secret code was already making the next fights. He's texting. Johnny has texting. He says, listen to this podcast idea robos to the eyeball. He just elbowed him right in the eye socket where the cut. That's where the Kate Tim Silva Silva game. Serious fight though. Well he did in the first round, but really the only thing he did is that left kick to the body. He just wiped blood off of his, I took too much and you know it's just, he's not in that league man.

Speaker 5:          02:45:06       He's just not in that league. This guy isn't a hell league. He dragged you into hell. Hell member. She looks just him. He is rough as it gets. He's been in there for a long time. He knows what it feels like to being hell. I'm just super, I'm super impressed that he bounced back from those herniated disc to not a scratch on his face. You can go drink a beer right now. It's five Kenny ever. Wow. That was, took some shots to the liver and he's the God damn. Do some core work. Maybe help his discs. Help the body. Well, I mean I'm sure he did something. He has a very unique training regimen. They were talking about it on my message board. They were detailing it, talking about some of the things he does. It carries a barrel filled with water like kill cause like you have to carry it with your hips and he carries it for five rounds and moves around with it.

Speaker 5:          02:45:54       It does a lot of crazy shit level interesting shit. All like hips and cores and glutes, all bunch of things that uh, his strength and conditioning coaches some pretty Monday. Monday you're going to see on my Instagram, me just carrying the big gas water bottle. It's a copycat league. You know what else works girls true could carry girl heavy chair and even big old heavy chair around the thing about a barrel as he puts it on your hands around. So what does he, I don't understand. Hoist it up, you know arches his back hips into it, you're saying, right? Yeah, exactly. You have to have your hips into it. The same way you would take, take a person down, bad technique and I can get a hold the pill or even defend a take down. Who are these fucking jokers? I'll tell you what, these little skinny neck pitchers don't know shit about MMA. Shut your mouth. They probably made the odds. Jay and Dan, did you make the odds? You fuck heads. Why don't you go talk about cricket? Talking about some shit. You understand. So, uh, I guess the podcast is over, right? I mean this is bad. It's a good time.

Speaker 5:          02:46:56       I'm calling us to success. I think this is a great, probably the greatest idea we've ever had collectively. Come see me in the admin. Matt, look at this. Eric Silva's still hasn't gotten up, man. He's sitting, he's exhausted, he's broken, and you know when he announces he's, he's realizing right now I'm not going to be the champion. Like I might be able to, you can't beat that kind. Not going to beat that guy. I'm not going to beat guys like him and I'm not going to beat guys that can beat him. Maybe it needs to fight 85 yeah, well baby needs to stop lifting weights. You know, this is the thing that dudes have to realize. I look at Matt Brown, not a big guy, man. He loved. I wish I could give it some bond. Give me some volume,

Speaker 5:          02:47:40       give it up campaigning for the title a little early for that baby. While he's one that man, he's won eight in a row about that. I would say I would definitely let, let him fight for the title. I mean Hendrix, right now, Johnny has to recover from a torn bicep surgery. This is the thing about the top of the food chain. So if you're fighting Woodley, if you're fighting Roy McDonald, you're fighting Hendricks and you've come forward like that, you're going to take it down. You're right. It's a different animal, right? It's a total, it's all about matchups now him verse coils conduct. That's an amazing fire. Carlos isn't shooting a AA. Yeah, but Carlos has got an ACL reconstruction. He does going to be out for awhile. I'm just saying there's certain guys, there's the top three guys that the very top are horrible matchups for him.

Speaker 5:          02:48:27       I don't know. But they wrestle man. But here's the thing, what if Woodley Beats Hendrickson, the title Matt Brown Fights Woodley and it gets into the fourth round. You know, I agree. I'm thinking about this motherfucker is, look, I don't think there's a baddest man on the planet anymore and it is. I totally agree about matchups. I totally agree. But this kid, man, I'm telling Matt Brown might be as fierce as anybody have ever seen fight as anybody. And everybody was saying that when he was in the octagon, you know, like, or rather when he was on the ultimate fighter was said, there was a thing about him. It just, he breaks motherfuckers, he breaks motherfuckers and I don't think people realize another UFC fighter is insane. Insane. Especially when the ranked number 14 in the world. I mean, think about the gritty guys you've seen. Like he was man just over and over. I mean out of all the guys who have fought in the UFC, who is fiercer me Vandelay when he was in pride, right. He's in pride is another level, but he was also juice to the gills. It's, that's why I meet another level. It's a different thing to different thing as having a real struggle time. That bell all sorts of, yeah, that kind of needs to learn how to tie, but you can't give a belt if you don't like, ah, fucking granny knot. That's shit. What are you fishing?

Speaker 5:          02:49:43       Tying up a boat to fuck. It's all goofy in the back. Look at it. It's all I ruined. The cockeyed shit is boys. That's toss. Horrible. Horrible. Imagine that you will go to your Fucking Room when your dad tells you to go to your room. Matt Brown, those kids, they just watched him crazy shit that they don't understand. Like Jenny getting a serious fight. Pure scared

Speaker 1:          02:50:07       eyes, but plus genetics, UFC active WinStreak John John 11 and, and Barao seven Matt Brown. Seven. Wow. Damn. Widen the sets. Impressive. Oh, either differences. Weidman never lost. John Jones. Never Lost Hanan. Barao never lost none of those guys I've ever lost the RQ. Wow. The last time I'm Matt loss was a is in ski, which is pretty crazy. He's, he's choking around. Yeah, they're choking. Right. And you know, happy. But I'm just saying after a war like that, he's fine. So right to he was completely disrespected by the odds, you know? And he's talked about it quite a bit in the pre fight that it's two and a half to one. And he was like, what the fuck is that about man? He's like, I've won six fucking fights in a row. And you look at the quality of competition. True. And then you look at the guys that Eric Silva fought and lost to Fitch and knocked out by Don Young Kim. Again, Don Young, Kim's up beast. No doubt about it. But how are you going to have that kid losing to that guy? Beating Sato and then coming off of that fight being a two to one favorite. That's crazy man. That is weird. Super Weird.

Speaker 1:          02:51:20       Well in fights. Nice. Get him

Speaker 5:          02:51:22       right. Fights is a success. I'm going to quit the UFC and just do this with you guys. Yeah, I'm done. This is more fun. It's way more fun to do it,

Speaker 1:          02:51:32       you know, just about as good as it gets. But I think I found my future. I don't like traveling guys.

Speaker 5:          02:51:38       I don't either. No one likes [inaudible]. We just did this right from the comfort of the podcast studio and the fucking might've been my favorite podcast of all time. Um, I need a shit load of pickles, pickles. It goes bulletproof coffee. You guys enjoy. The wines were good. I enjoyed every aspect of this. Look at this as a stare down. Here's the highlights again. Eric Silva, Eric Silva, and he heard him with that kick. It's kind of a friend kiss. It's, it's almost like a cocoon, knows kicked that sort of crossing kick did. He does, but look all over him. Work in the nic crank too much effort in that. Yup, you're right. And he, he gassed out because of that. But I think it's also the body, the body weight cut. I agree. When I rented to Silva in Brazil, I swear to God, the kid had to be 200 pounds.

Speaker 5:          02:52:29       If he's not 200 pounds, he's fucking clothes. There's that cake again. It's like a front kick butt at an angle. It's how cocoons throws it. It's like they call it a crescent kick, but it's not a crescent kick because it's a front kick because it's with the ball of the foot. I'll get you hooked him in the body there. Probably same spot where you got hurt before. It's a nasty inclusive. Eric Silva was just overwhelmed by the ferocity of Brett to do. Just was never comfortable ever. I'll tell you what I got. I'm gonna say it right now. Matt Brown was my favorite fighter next to Brennan shop, my favorite fight. I mean, not that he's the best, but his fun is to watch. He, he just forces everything to be war. You have no choice but to be in the war. Yeah. No, you're not going to sit back and make it look pretty. It doesn't matter who you are. When you've signed them to fight Matt Brown, you better get ready to have a crazy pace. All the pretty shit's out the window. You can be in the clinch and be eaten body shots. It's crazy to watch something like that. Like he must've won a lot of fight of the night bonuses. Oh, well if he didn't, there's a fucking terrible travesty. Amazing, amazing fights. All right.
