Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two, one,

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       and we're live. What's up? Right. Hey Man, let's go on. Great. Sam Harris, ladies and gentlemen at Harris and Harris. Dan and Sam. No relation, obviously no relation and brother from another mother kind of thing. Aw, sweet. Actually know how we work this out. We are deeply unrelated because you're your Harris is the Jewish side of your family, right?

Speaker 3:          00:00:24       No, no, no, no. To my Harris is the Yes to actually, no, you're right. My Harris is the Jewish side of the family. It was changed at Ellis Island from allegedly from Adis, which doesn't sound Jewish either, but uh, yes,

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       right. Your heart is the Glam side of the family. Funny how many people's names were changed at Ellis Island? Yeah, like what are they like? Nah, not American enough. Meanwhile, snorts egg made it proudly. Yeah. Odd. So, uh, anyway, thanks for coming you guys. Thanks for having some weird time. You know, I've been extra weirded out over the last couple months and I just got back from Mexico, was on vacation. I didn't do shit for a week and in not doing anything for a week, I really got a chance to sit down and think about stuff and I'm more weirded out by life today than I think I ever have been before. So I'm excited to have you on because I want to hear your story because Sam has been telling me about it and I looked into it and please explain like what happened to you, like where you were and what happened to you.

Speaker 3:          00:01:27       Okay. So it was a, you're, you're talking about the panic attack. It was 2004. I was on a little show that we do at ABC news called Good Morning America. Big shots, a big show show. It's not a little show. And I was, I was doing the job that I was filling in as the news reader. That's the person who comes on at the top of each hour and reason the headlines. And I just freaked out. I just lost it. So as a couple seconds into it and I, I started to get really scared and it just, uh, if you've ever had a pet, have you ever had a panic? No. So it's like anxiety on steroids, so you start to worry, but then your fight or flight instincts kick in. So, um, your lungs seize up, your palms start sweating, your mouth dries up, your heart is racing, your mind is racing. You just, I couldn't breathe and therefore couldn't speak. So a couple of seconds into reading what was supposed to be six stories right off of the teleprompter. I just, I lost the capacity to speak and I had to kind of squeak out a, something about, you know, back to you,

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       to the main anchors. Wow. That sucked. Uncontrollable. No. What, what caused it?

Speaker 3:          00:02:41       I do, yeah, definitely know I'm some dumb behavior in my personal life is what caused it. I had spent a lot of time as a war reporter at ABC News. I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza six, six trips to and uh, I had come home from a long run and I covered a kind of pre-invasion invasion and then a insurgency in one's kind of six month run and I came home after that and I got depressed and I didn't actually know I was depressed, but I was having some obvious symptoms in hindsight. Uh, I was having trouble getting out of bed, felt like that, had a low grade fever all the time. And then I did something really smart, which is I started to self medicate with cocaine and ecstasy. Uh, and even though I wasn't doing it all the time, I like to say it wasn't like that, you know, you ever see the wolf of Wall Street where they're popping ludes that that wasn't me.

Speaker 3:          00:03:38       I was, and I wasn't getting high on the air or anything like that, but, you know, I was getting, I was partying in my spare time because it made me feel better. Uh, so after I had the panic attack I went to a doctor who's an expert in panic and he started asking me a bunch of questions, try to figure out what, what, what had caused the panic attack and one of the questions was do, do drugs, and I was like, yeah, I do drugs. And he leaned back in his chair and gave me a look. That's communicated, uh, the following sentiment. Um, okay asshole mystery solved. And he just pointed out that, you know, you raised the level of adrenaline in your brain artificially, uh, you, you make it much more likely to have a panic attack. And I at at, at baseline, I'm a jittery little dudes so it doesn't, doesn't take much to put me in that zone. We can just offer me coffee. And I said no because that even that will freak me out.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Well, it's weird that ecstasy and cocaine was the combination because ecstasy is something that they actually give to a lot of soldiers that have ptsd. And there's been quite a few tests on that. Yeah, I don't, I don't actually think ecstasy was the problem. The coke, I think it was a coke. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So those are the two drugs I was mostly doing. How often were you doing it?

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       I would say, you know, there would be months where I wasn't doing it at all because I would, I was off. I covered the 2004 presidential campaign that I didn't have a lot of time to be snorting coke. So, um, but when I was home and around my friends, you know, on a good, on a busy week, you know, two, three times a week.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Wow. That's a lot. Yeah, that'll do you [inaudible] there's a, there's a comeback right now that cocaine is experiencing really ever go away. I don't know, I've never done it. Was there some sort of cocaine recession that had to bounce back from? I believe there was really. No, this is what I'm talking totally ignorant. I've been out of the game for a long time, so yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm kind of boring now. I'm a, but it feels to me like it's kind of a perennial favorite. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I feel like it went through a recession, maybe it's just my perception. I had a buddy of mine when I was in high school and his cousin was hooked on coke and I watched while we're in high school, we start selling it and he withered away, lost like 30 pounds or something like that and just him and his girlfriend just hide out in the attic. They lived, they had an attic apartment. They would just hide out there and watch TV and do coconut oil, coke to people and I was like, well

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       fuck that drug, whatever that drug's doing. Like these people. It was almost like knowing someone who had gotten bitten by a vampire become something different. It was very strange. So my experience is seeing people do that led me to never do it. Yeah, I mean it certainly was not like that for me, but you know, I, I could see it over the horizon. You can. It's an incredibly addictive drug. So I think you've made the right call. Yeah, it seems a little. It's got a little too much gravity attached to it. Yeah, I mean, you, you, you can get hooked and it will bring you down. There are other drugs you can do. I'm not recommending drugs, but, uh, the way of my friend Sam, my, my half brother, Sam over there. Let me get to it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       Uh, there are other drugs, drugs you can do that have vastly lower addictive, uh, a character, a character. What's the word I'm looking for here? So, characteristics. Yes. Thank you. Um, so how did you recover? I, so I wasn't actually doing it that long. I actually never done hard drugs into my early thirties and when I came home from the war zones and, and that's what started it. Yeah. Were freaked out by seeing too much. No, you know, it's actually wasn't ptsd. Uh, it was, I was addicted to the adrenaline I was having was not that I was traumatized. It was that I was enjoying it too much and I would come home and the world would seem gray and boring. Uh, yes. That was, that was the problem. Did you watch her locker? I'm sure you did it, yeah. Did that resonate with you? It's been a while since I watched it, but apps, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          00:07:32       I want to just be clear that the experience of a journalist is so different from the experience, so much more mild than the experience of a, an enlisted man or a woman. So I don't want to compare my experience to, to the hurt locker. I'm a observer on the side and I, and, and I don't even want to compare my experience to more experienced work correspondence out there. I'm thinking of like guys like Richard Angle and I'm absolutely just actually sat down with him the other day for he's got to do documentary coming out. Um, my experiences are much more mild than that, but certainly enough to really get a sense of how thrilling it is. There's an expression, there's nothing more thrilling than the bullet that misses you. And in my case, luckily they all missed. That was not true for some of my friends.

Speaker 3:          00:08:18       Um, but you. So I, I had a real sense of the stakes, but 80 is exciting. It's also thrilling on a, um, on a idealistic level. I mean, I believe in the importance of bearing witness to the what, to the tip of the spirit, to what we're doing, to what our military is doing in our name. So all of that is a heady mix. So you knew people over there, a journalist that got killed? Oh yeah, absolutely. A very good friend of mine, the guy who actually ultimately set me up with my wife. It was a guy named Bob Woodruff, who was the anchor of world news tonight on ABC News. He had only been in the chair for about a month when he was on a trip to Iraq and he got hit, literally got his head nearly blown off when he was in the back when he was in the top of an Iraqi tank.

Speaker 3:          00:09:04       Uh, almost died. He was an absolute miracle is alive. There are pictures of him on the Internet with basically half ahead. Um, traumatic brain injury was brought back to life is to this day walking miracle that he's alive. Uh, and, and after he recovered, he then introduced me to the woman I married. So he's a close friend and I, uh, I saw cases like that, lost friends, both Iraqi friends and journalist friends. Um, my, the woman I was dating at the time when I, when I was spending a lot of time in Iraq, she got hit by a tank show. Um, she was in, in the hotel Palestine where all the journalists were staying. She was on a balcony in or one of her colleagues in the balcony below or he got a direct hit and died. Uh, he, she carried him to the hospital and she basically got the reverberations and couldn't hear. Still can't hear as far as I know.

Speaker 2:          00:10:02       When you're a journalist and you're over in Iraq or in Afghanistan, you're in war and what you're experiencing is so far removed from the day to day life that most people experience. What, what is it like trying to relay that to people? How difficult is it trying to. Because I think so many people have this almost a dramatic television movie slash view of, of war where they don't, they don't ever experience it. Like I would imagine probably 99 percent of the people that are in this country will never experience.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       No. And that's good. You know, it's, it's, I don't know that you can describe it, uh, in a way that will really give the full picture of, it's a absurdities and, and horrors and long stretches of boredom punctuated by terror. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:11:00       and also this other piece which is taboo to talk about, which is the pleasure and excitement. Then people get fighting wars. I mean, go. This is Sebastian younger's thesis as well. I mean they just, the comradery is the most intense comradery they ever experienced. And so they, that's something they come back to civilian life and are missing it in and it's part of what's so difficult about coming back

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       and that's why you see them there. A lot of risk taking behavior among a vets. Um, because I know that you're looking for another way to get that hit of adrenaline for sure. There was a, there was a book, and I'm blanking on the name, is a great book written by a much more experienced war correspondent to me that he used the phrase war is a drug and that to me sums it up, at least in my experience, I got hooked on the experience of being in these really elevated, heightened situations, cinematic dramatic situations and I would come home and I just, I didn't know what to do to replace it. And so this synthetic squirt of adrenaline that you can get from cocaine seem to do it for me, obviously had tremendously negative consequences and so I wouldn't recommend it, but I see why people do this.

Speaker 3:          00:12:17       So how did you, how did you bounce back? That was actually the question you asked me before that I somehow neglected to answer. So the doctor who pointed out that I was an idiot and doing drugs and it caused a panic attack. Uh, I agreed he didn't think I needed to go to rehab because it was the, it was pretty short lived. It was. I was in my early thirties when I started on. Still in my early thirties when I had a panic attack and so it was only a couple of years, he said, just have wanting to come see me once or twice a week forever, forever basically saying it. He said basically indefinitely. So I still say it, but not, not. Yeah, it's a good business model, but not that. I mean it's been, well north of a, it's been about 13 years, so I don't see them that often now, but for a long time I saw him intensively so that, you know, it wasn't easy. It's not easy and I wouldn't have, I wouldn't call what I mean, there are people who have had drug addictions that are vastly more severe than mine. Um, but it's, it sucks to stop a habit that is giving you pleasure on, you know, pretty, pretty prominent areas of your brain while you're

Speaker 5:          00:13:30       situation. What you're talking about is very, very, very extreme situation. Like being a journalist, a war correspondent, going over there, experiencing that intense sort of adrenaline rush and then having your, your issues with it. But it seems like there's a tremendous amount of people today that are stimulating themselves. Adderall. It was a big one. I mean it's just A. I know I've, I've found out recently like four or five people that I didn't know that were on adderall and it seems like you just sort of start asking questions and you find out how many people. I mean all these, my kid goes to school with a bunch of other kids and you get to meet the parents and like fucking half of them were on adderall. It's very weird. And adderall is a form of amphetamine and it seems like, um, it just, it's mind boggling how many people are doing this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       We're dosing ourselves with all sorts of things so it can be stimulated stimulants, but it also can be a Benzos, you know, cousins of Valium. Um, it can be shopping, gambling, it can be a, a whatever except the twitter. Um, and I think it, just speaking, we have a neuroscientist in the room, so I'll let him say more about this. And also a guy who's more experienced practitioner of Buddhism that I am. But, but, you know, it does speak to the nature of the

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       human mind that we're always on the hunt for the next little hit of dopamine and now there are lots of ways to get it. Well, it's also very bizarre that you can just do that. I mean, I don't think there's ever been a time in history where you could just take a pill and you'll be elevated for five or six hours. I mean that your doctor will give you this pill and they'll encourage you to take it and then you'll find out that 50 percent of the people in your community and take it. I've been, I've done stories about parents who steal it from the kids.

Speaker 4:          00:15:20       Also just caffeine. I mean I'm, you know, I'm reaching for the coffee here, having slept poorly last night. But that is, and that's just as much of a drug. It's just not as. It's not as potent. The drug is taken methamphetamine or, or, or adderall or anything else that's a drug drug. But, um, mean as a whole, this, this had civilizational consequences when, when humanity, more or less switched from alcohol in the morning to caffeine in the morning, that's just, things got a lot different than we used for, for hundreds of years. People were just drinking ale and wine in the morning, uh, before, before coffee and tea became huge in Europe. And, and it, it kind of colonialism the, the, the engine of colonialism to a significant degree was coffee, tea, sugar, and, you know, things are behavior changed.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       So people that were drinking ale and wine weren't, wasn't a big part of it. The reason why they drank it with food is because the water would get stagnant.

Speaker 4:          00:16:21       Yeah. Well there's the issue with clean water too. Yeah. Yeah. But when, if just imagine the consequences of you and everyone, you know, getting up in the morning and just starting with beer or wine

Speaker 2:          00:16:34       that

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       long day or a very short one. Yeah. So, um, but yeah, it's. But the fundamental point of the underlying neuroscience is that all of these drugs, anything you're putting into your body, it is modifying the behavior of your brain, is only modifying the existing available neurochemistry of your brain. I mean the these, these molecules either gets your brain to secrete more of an existing neurotransmitter or they mimic an existing neurotransmitter binding to the same receptor site where they keep something in play longer than it would otherwise have been, that they block the uptake of of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. So it's not. You're a drug is never get in your brain to do something. Your brain is incapable of doing so. And that's the most extreme thing, like dmt or Lsd in the brain. The brain is still doing all of that. And so it stands to reason that there are potentially other ways of getting the brain to do that. Whether it's meditation or whether it's computer interface ultimately to the brain. People who are interested in in brain computer interface that not only allows a quadriplegic to move a robotic arm or gets a a, a Parkinson's patient to be able to move. But you know, the, to the ultimate degree, I mean actually augmenting human function that's a or opening landscapes of mind, psychedelic and otherwise that have been unexplored. I mean, all, all of that is

Speaker 6:          00:18:15       um,

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       in principle possible because again, we're just talking about electro chemical phenomenon happening in our heads which are being, which is just there to be

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       modulator. Now when you were talking about being depressed and Sam, you're talking about re uptake inhibitors, I want to know what are your, what are your thoughts on the massive amount of people there are on Ssri is now. I mean this is another thing that I know how many people I know that I'm either on or have been on some sort of antidepressants and it seems, I mean to the layman, to me, to someone who's never taken them or doesn't have personal experience with it massively overprescribed.

Speaker 4:          00:18:57       Yeah. Well anything I say is with the caveat that this is. I mean, I'm not a neurologist. I don't have. No. I have zero clinical experience and I'm certainly not my area. I'm not up on the recent literature on the efficacy of antidepressants, but there is clearly, it's like anything, there's a spectrum. There are people who have been unambiguously helped by antidepressants and there are people who are on them who shouldn't be on them, you know, and there are people who are on them who wants to get off them and find it surprisingly difficult to get off them. And it's uh, it's just, it's, these are blunt instruments by by definition because it's anything that's modulating serotonin in this case is effective everywhere. Serotonin is effective and it's just, there's no magical property of

Speaker 6:          00:19:54       have a

Speaker 4:          00:19:57       finding the neuromodulator where, where only the symptoms you want to relieve our effect because these, these, these chemicals do a lot of things and a lot of places and even in your gut, right? So it's not said that hence the side effects you get with almost any medication. And we would have to get, it would be in many respects as a matter of luck to find a pharmacological target that actually does just what you want it to do. Because it just to say that, that those receptors are not elsewhere, that are going to reduce side effects for you. So, um, that, that's why a different kind of a intervention, something like ultimately some, some electrical or magnetic or, or a machine based could be more targeted because then you're, you're not just putting something in the bloodstream that spreads everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       Bye Bye. Machine based. You mean something like electrodes that they put on the mind to or the surface of the head to stimulate areas of the brain.

Speaker 4:          00:21:01       Yeah. Yeah. And again, what we have now is also still pretty primitive and anything that you would have that would be super futuristic wouldn't seem to require that you, you put something actually inside your head, right? So whether that's a neurosurgery or I'm putting something into the bloodstream that somehow gets inside your head what it is an injectable, um, you know. So for instance, Elon Musk just mentioned something called a which he called neural lace, which is a, believe a term that came from a Scifi novel. I don't think it originates with him. I'm not a big science fiction reader, but he's got a, uh, he announced an investment in a company called neuro neuro link, which is looking at looking at some advanced brain computer interface, uh, based on the idea that you could get a way with the, with these new micro electrodes, you can get an injectable Mesh like a, like a wire mesh that just integrates with the brain or very likely just the cortex.

Speaker 4:          00:22:11       Uh, and I believe this work has already been done in mice and the mice are, you know, have survived and are living with, with this mesh in there in their brains. And again, this is not research. I'm close to it all. I'm in and he just announced it a couple of weeks ago. But, um, in principle, yeah, you're, you're talking about having a, whether it's a mesh or whether it's, it's a bag neato electric particles and it's something that is on site around individual neurons or assemblages of neurons which can both read out and input wirelessly signal from those neurons. So just both, you know, putting your thoughts into the world by, you know, influencing effectors, a robotic arms or cursors on screens or whatever it is, and also influencing your mind based on whatever

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       puts you want to put in there from the world, whether that's Doug mentions, hack you and yeah, exactly. Well that opens, it opens all of those concerns. You know, the Russians, it's always the Russians, Chinese gambling. I think the Chinese people are responsible for a lot of the propaganda that makes us think about the Russians. Just push it off on them, push it off on them. Um, I'm prepared to blame the Russians for a lot at this point. Blame a law. What a slippery slope though for humans becoming cyborgs. I mean we're, we're already like some weird form of semi hot right now. Karen, our cell phones, like it's a baby, you know, like you leave your cell phone or home like, oh my God, I forgot the baby. I mean it's a very strange thing that we already have and there's not a whole lot of steps between that and snapchat glasses.

Speaker 2:          00:23:49       Jamie's got the snapchat glasses and seeing those things I didn't know they existed. The other very strange they are. They have little cameras on them and now you to go ahead, throw them on. So. But now he knows how to use them. Google glass just was totally still born right? I mean I didn't. Yeah, it didn't work. So He's, he's, he's transmitting or he's making a video right now with that left side. See how the left side of spinning with snapchat do like 15 seconds, 10 seconds at 10. A little counter. It's just flashing. Was like the last three seconds and you can hit it again and do another 20 seconds so you can hold it and do like 30 seconds or something like that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       Step one. Is that spinning just to alert the people you're looking at that

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       to sort of alert me to, to let me know that my recording is done. Probably a little bit to let you know too, but that's probably the only notification. You know that I'm recording and it just posts. It doesn't post automatically and now I have to link it to my phone and then post it from there. Okay. The Google glass thing made people very uncomfortable. I mean I, I tried to very early prototype. I have a good friend of mine who was a executive at Google at the time and she got ahold of one of the really early ones that actually had to be tethered by a cord and you know, you talk to it and swipe it and I played with it a couple of times and we used it once at a ufc way in where I put it on and I broadcast from the way and it's very, very odd. But it made people made people very uncomfortable. Like you could see the difference when they saw you with that thing on all of a sudden there was all this apprehension. They're being recorded, are transmitted or. But how long? How long do we have where we're still people?

Speaker 4:          00:25:19       Well, how long before you asked that question? Our sense of private. I remember, I remember what it was like to be neurotic about the sound of your voice on a voicemail or Laura on the answering machine, right? Like rerecording the outgoing message and, and just just being worried about your voice showing up and someone else's tape. Right. And now we were living in this pan optic on surveillance society where you just assume you're on camera virtually every moment or in public, although I guess people don't think about it all that much. Um, yeah, I mean I think we're the norms around privacy shift just because we get so much value from having the data ultimately

Speaker 2:          00:26:06       I guess, but it just seems also like to just this inexorable pole towards this connection we're going to have it. It just seems like if you just, if you take where we are now and sort of look at all the data points and extrapolate, it doesn't look good,

Speaker 4:          00:26:24       it just salt, but it's both. It's both bad and good. The fake news thing is horrible, but the ability to fact check in, to be able to pick up your phone and find out what's true is has also never been better, so it's like we're both vulnerable in a way that we've never been and where we're empowered

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       in a way that we've always been true, but technological progress. Yeah. It just seems like there's a certain amount of time we have left before we give birth to some new thing we're talking about just integrating ourselves biologically with, with our machines and also something that's independent of us, some artificial intelligence independent of us. You want, you want to look for some fear around that. You got the right guy, right? Yeah. Well we've talked about Evan's past those fears here. Yeah. Yeah. I mean Josh has apps freaked me out this morning, sent me some articles about the self driving trucks that are already going in Australia that are as big as a seven 67 and they're driving down the road by themselves with cargo, probably nuclear waste or something. You know, just to wind down the road, but people are so bad at it.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       Driving that, yeah, the robots just have to get reliably better than people and then you'll just feel nothing but relief. They probably already are yet. Well, yeah, I mean they're. I think they probably are, as far as I know from what I hear from Tesla that yeah, the, the accident, the man hours, they have people using the autopilot in the autopilots not at all. Perfect. Obviously two people have died already from, from using it badly, but still they have something like some millions of man hours. You have autopilot assisted driving and I think that is has been safer than just pure ape.

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       Did you see the video of the guy who fell asleep in traffic in San Francisco? He's literally out cold and his car is driving on the highway kind of fit. I mean he's just some guy on his way to work, just pass out completely mouth open and people are filming them. His cars driving down the road and actually probably the people filming him or doing the. The more dangerous thing. You're right. Yeah. Well texting and driving drive me crazy to see it. Like to be in an uber now you can look around, you can see how many people are texting. Yeah. Including your driver sometimes. Yeah. That drives me crazy. I. Here's the guy that dude's Alcoa is cars creeping along and stop and go traffic and he is completely alcohol. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       Well it works. The autopilot works. Yeah. No, it does work. Yeah. Texting and driving scares the shit out of me. That pokemon go thing. Thank God that that died off but stopped. I was driving on the highway and there was a woman to the left of us and I noticed that she was being, her face was illuminated by her cell phone. So I look over and she's playing pokemon as she's driving. So I guess I don't know how pokemon works, but I guess you pick up things and as you're driving you get stuff. And so she was playing the game while she was on the hot, barely paying attention to the road. Looking at her phone. This is the argument for, for robot drivers. Yeah. Yeah. And also it will open up and when you are ultimately being driven safely,

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       buy a car that you trust more than you trust yourself. Then just imagine the, the, the information consumption, entertainment options that open up there. You'll watch movies, you'll, you'll, you'll listen to podcasts, you'll get work done and it will become a space of more not, we're not gonna miss having to pay attention to the road. You know, maybe maybe there's some people want to drive recreationally for some reason, but um, it's, it will just be a new space where you won't believe that 40,000 people every year were dying because we couldn't figure out how to drive safely. But isn't that a slippery slope like $40,000? Well that's a great thing that 40,000 people are not going to die. But the idea that we're going gonna stop people from driving a car, you're gonna have to live with these 40,000 people. That's not what I was going to say, but I was gonna say, I mean pretty much all the things that people do.

Speaker 4:          00:30:34       And then it's going to get down to why have people mean ultimately that's the. When I look at the event horizon of artificial intelligence, it's why, why would we were so far? We're not going to get our shit together by the time artificial intelligence is given birth to. While that that all goes to what we build, we build artificial intelligence that is independent of us and seems conscious and is more powerful than us. Well then we are. We have built a in limit. We have essentially built a god that we now have to be in relationship to and hopefully that works out well for us. And it's very easy to see how it might not. I think they're even scarier cases in that that we could build something that has like power, but there's no reason. I think it's conscious. It's just, it's just, it's no more conscious than our current computers, which is to say that intelligence and consciousness may be separable phenomenon that you could.

Speaker 4:          00:31:36       Intelligence can scale, but consciousness need not come along for the ride. And that for me is the worst case scenario because we inherit all of the danger of, of, of this, the power of this system being misaligned with our interest. We could build something that is godlike in its power. And yet, uh, we, we could essentially be canceling the prospects of the evolution of consciousness because of this thing wipes us out that, you know, I think it's, I'm Nick Bostrom, the philosopher who wrote a great book on this entitled Superintelligence, I think he calls this the Disneyland without children and were like, well, basically we could build this, this incredibly powerful, intelligent landscape that continues to refine itself and its own powers. Uh, who knows what ways, my ways perhaps that are, that are unimaginable to us. And yet they're, the lights aren't on. You know, there's, there's, there's nothing that is like to be this machine or system of machines is in the way that is probably nothing that has to be the internet right now.

Speaker 4:          00:32:41       You think of all this going on, on the Internet. I, you know, I don't think the Internet is conscious of any of it right now. The question is could the internet become conscious of what its thinking and um, I think there's no reason to think it couldn't, it's just we don't understand the, the physical basis of consciousness, yet the real question is why would it do anything? I mean if it doesn't have any of the biological motivations that people have to breed and to stay alive and to, you know, fight or flight and to be nervous and this desire to carry on our genes mean if you really did build the ultimate supercomputer artificial intelligence that was beyond our capacity for reason and understanding what niches do. Nothing because everything is pointless. Well, no, because what we would do, we would program it, it would do whatever we asked it to do initially, right?

Speaker 4:          00:33:29       We things we program now have goals, right? Your, your thermostat is trying to regulate the temperature in the room. Um, and when get, when it gets too warm, it kicks on the air and it, when it gets too cold, it kicks on the heat. And I mean, that's just it. That's a goal, right? And um, so we would, we are everything we build. That's automated, has goals explicitly programmed into it, and when you're talking about a truly intelligent machine, it will have, it will discover a goals that you have never programmed into it, that are our intermediate to the goal that you have programs. So if, if the goal of this machine is to pick up all the trash in this room and you physically try to stop it, well then it's gonna try to get around you to pick up the rest of the trash and the room.

Speaker 4:          00:34:20       Right? So it's, it's, you know, this probably already true of a Roomba, right? I actually don't have a room, but, but if you, if you put something in the way of the room, but it's going to get around the thing you have put in it's way so that it can get to the rest of the room. So that's an intermediate goal. And some of these goals need never have been explicitly thought about or represented, which is to say programmed into it. And yet they, they're, they're formed by, by the fact that the thing has a longterm goal. And one of the, one of the concerns is that we could build something that has a longterm goal, build something that's super powerful, that has a longterm goal, which in principle is benign, right? As executive, this is something we want, and yet it could discover instrumental goals that are deeply hostile to what we want.

Speaker 4:          00:35:09       I mean, the thing doesn't have common sense, right? We haven't figured out how to build common sense into the machine so that the cartoon examples of this kind of thing. But one example that Ilan used when he first was expressing fears about this, if you built a machine, the only goal of which was was to cancel spam, right? No more. We don't want it. What we want. No more spam. Get rid of the spam. Well, an easy way to get rid of spam is just killed all the people right now. That's a crazy thing to think, but it's not in unless you've built, unless you've closed the door to that intermediate goal, there's no reason to think that a

Speaker 5:          00:35:47       for powerful machine couldn't form such a goal. My question would be, if this super powerful machine has the ability to create new super powerful machines, wouldn't use the same mandate, would it, would it still try to follow the original programming or would it realize that our original program is only instrumental to the success of the human race and it might think the human race is ridiculous and preposterous and why? Why not just program something that it thinks is the ultimate intelligence? Something beyond our capacity for reasoning and understanding now and that thing. I would wonder in the absence of any sort of biological motivations and the absence would mean. Do you think of all the things that we do, I mean you, you break it down to what motivates people to get out of bed. What motivates people to do good, but my sense of community, a desire to breed the social status, all these different things that motivate people to do things. We remove all of those. And what actions would it take?

Speaker 4:          00:36:46       Well, I think, I think you want to build it in a way that is focused on our wellbeing. And so for instance, I had Stuart Russell on my podcast, he's a computer scientist at Berkeley who, um, unlike many computer scientists takes this problem really seriously and has a thought a lot about it. And in his lab, I believe they're working on a, a way of thinking about safety that is, that is open ended and flexible without, without pretending we have any of the right answers in the near term or, or likely to have them. So you want to build a system that wants to know what you want, right at each point. Like, so that's tracking what humanity one wants in terms of its goals and wants to stay aligned with whatever it is we want, um, wants to, wants to learn from what we seem to want based on our behavior.

Speaker 4:          00:37:50       But, um, and so there could be some kind of clarifying function. Where were we, you know, we can get our priorities more aligned in dialogue with the super intelligent machine. But the bottom line is it always wants to do it. It doesn't think it knows what we want and it continually wants to keep approximating better and better what we want. And so from my point of view, the most crucial thing is you, you always want the door to remain open to the statement. Wait, wait, wait. That's not what I wanted. Right? Like you wouldn't want to be in the presence of this. God likes super power that will always take direction from you when say, wait, wait, wait, that's

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       not going in the right direction and this. So the fear is we could build something that is, is just not amenable to being controlled in that way.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       Is it not the case that computer scientists are starting to come around to the idea that there's real danger, a, potentially there's dangerous potential in, in, in Ai. I mean, I was listening to when you talked to will macaskill a few weeks ago who was saying, you know, we, it was, it was just a few years from starting to think about how to split the atom to actually having a bomb. Um, are they not coming around the idea that these, that technology can progress much faster than we think of?

Speaker 5:          00:39:13       Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, it's a whole spectrum of the people who think that this is never going to happen or it's so far away that thinking about it now is completely irrational to people who are super worried and think that huge changes are imminent. And so it's just the spectrum. I'm with the ladder. Yeah. No, it's as am I, what my concern is not even with the initial construction, like the initial ai, my concern is with what the ai creates. If we give the AI ability to improve upon itself and look at are irrational thoughts and how we've programmed itself to support the human race. And then it might go, well, why the fuck would I do that? Like you guys are ridiculous. Like, oh, this is a new life form. This is a new. We've given birth to some incredibly potent new thing that we think of it as artificial by.

Speaker 5:          00:40:01       I mean, is it really, it's just a form of life. It's a form of life that we've created. Human beings have sort of, the analogy I always use is that we're some sort of an electronic caterpillar giving birth to some spectacular butterfly we're not even aware of while we're building our cocoon. We're just doing it. I mean there's a caterpillar fully conscious of what it's doing when it makes that cocoon, probably not, but it just does and there's plenty of examples of that in nature of something that's doing something that's going through some metamorphosis that's completely unconscious. My worry would be. I guess it's not even really a worry. It's more like looking at the possibility of the AI improving upon itself and making a far better version than we could create like almost instantaneously. Right? Isn't that if you give it the ability to be autonomous and you give it the ability to innovate and to try to figure out what's a better way around things and what's a better way to program things and then make its own version of what it is.

Speaker 5:          00:40:59       It's going to be spectacular. I mean it really will be just. I mean it's obviously just talking shit, but really would be a god. I mean, you're talking about something that if we give it the ability to create, we give it the ability to think, reason, rationalize, and then build, build something better. I mean by bill, you should be thinking more software than hardware to make it there. There's obviously there's anything is possible. Anything that can be built with intelligence can be built with intelligence, so you could be talking about armies of robots and nanotechnology and everything else. That's. That is the staple

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       of the PSI Phi scare scenario, but I'm more likely and certainly faster and ultimately more powerful. You're talking about something that can rewrite it's own code, improve. I mean it's, it's, it's the code that is that is dictating the intelligence and so you're talking about something that could be for the longest time, invisible and just happening on the Internet, right? You're talking about code that could, could be put into financial markets, right? Which could be built to be self modifying. Right, and then it's already out in the wild. It's not. It's not sequestered in some air gapped computer in a lab. It's out there and it's changing itself. Now. That would be totally irresponsible thing to do from a, from a, uh, a software designers point of view, I think at this point, but um, there's just no question that we're going to get to a place where I'm going.

Speaker 4:          00:42:35       It's either, either it will be the province of one lab that gets there first or it will be open source, but you're talking about software rev, US figuring out how to write better. It's better software which becomes the basis of general intelligence and then where that gets put and what gets done with that. That's, that's the question isn't in the real question of also the race to see who can come up with one first. I mean once, once the idea gets put out there, like the idea of the nuclear bomb. I mean obviously no one in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to make a nuclear bomb. What that story is. Especially a sobering because I may forget the, the details. I think it was. I couldn't, I could have this backwards. I think it was Rutherford, the two famous physicists involve to Rutherford who said we're never going to unlock the, the, the, um, I think, yeah, I think it was Rutherford gave a talk saying that we're never going to unlock the energy that we now know to be in the Adam and Leo Szilard the next day produced the, the, uh, the equations that I'm locked in the next, next and an indirect response to this announcement.

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       Like, okay, let's just wait. That's bullshit. And they gave him the next morning, woke up and produce that. They produced the math that gave us the, the atomic bomb. So it's, it can happen really fast and if you want to get those details exactly right. Listen to what's Stuart Russell said on my podcast. Well, oppenheimer in like a really ironic twist wasn't a Buddhist. He. No, he was a fan of, of um, Hinduism. Technically. I mean he was, he taught himself Sanskrit apparently in three months. One never how much this is exaggerated, but his, his publicists will tell you that he taught himself Sanskrit in three months to read the Bhagavad Gita, which is the one of the texts of, of Hinduism, the quote that he gave out as the first bomb was tested. I've become death, death destroyer of worlds. And then when you hear him saying it's even more creepy because you could see the sort of remorse.

Speaker 4:          00:44:57       And so have you seen it? No. I also get the photo. Every photo of Oppenheimer. He looks, he just looks haunted. Well, he was hanging out with weird to see him with his general. I was watching some documentary on the creation of the atom bomb and he was, uh, you know, it's hanging out with these generals as they're probably Curtis Lemay. Yeah. And you see the two of them together and you're like, what a bizarre pairing. Like this one monkey needs this other genius to make this bomb so he can drop it on these people. And the guy realizes that if he doesn't make it, someone's going to make it and it could be dropped on them. And that's, that's the thing we are, we were genuinely in a race condition there and we, and we didn't know how close the Nazis were. It turns out that they weren't as close as we feared. But yeah, just imagine Hitler haven't gotten there first. Right. With the help of Heisenberg and others play at Jamie

Speaker 7:          00:46:08       scripture, the game test persuade to pressed him takes on form. Now I ended up coming to worlds.

Speaker 4:          00:46:43       He does not look like a happy dude. What a, what a burden. But it's actually, I read the history of that, that effort, the Manhattan project and the Trinity Test. It is super sobering because there was, they move forward in, in a context of real uncertainty about what was going to happen. I mean there were they, in terms of the yield of the first bomb, there was a, a range, I think of a, a hundred fold difference of opinion of what they were going to get. This thing went off. Um, and there were some people who still placed some possibility a on the prospect of igniting the atmosphere. Yeah. And just canceling all of life right now, they had, they had spent a lot of time to, I mean, they did something like due diligence where they were, many of them were confident it wouldn't, but that was not without, beyond the realm of possibility for some of the people working on it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:49       And um, so we, we have shown a propensity for taking possibly existential risks to develop new technology because there's, there's a reason to develop it. And in this case, the destruct, the destructive potential is so obvious because it's all destructive potential. I mean, we're, we're building the biggest bombs we possibly can build. And so it, it's just, it's not difficult to think about the danger. It's all danger, right? Um, and these bombs, you know, now getting into the hands of the wrong people with Ai, it's so seductive because if you looked at it, looked at in, in, in one light, it's just all upside and there's nothing better than intelligence is nothing more intrinsically desirable than intelligence. And so to get more of it is, seems an intrinsic good. And so it takes an extra step to say, well, wait a minute, this could in fact be the most dangerous thing we've ever done. And you have to, you have to. You have to spend a lot of time fighting that, that ideological battle with people who just think, no, just this is just all upside. This is what could be. What could go wrong. You're just, you're just scare mongering and the year just evil that you've seen too many terminator movies.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       Is that even possible to. No, not. Not with the first. The first was good. First one. Second was good. There's one in there that I don't think I've seen all of the three or four. I don't know. Like I think it was. I think I lost touch after the second I've seen. I haven't seen any more than two. I, I dunno, I just, I feel like it's been because of the race because the idea that there's a race to get to it, it seems like it's inevitable that someone actually does create it and much like the atomic bomb, it'll probably launched, probably be launched without a true understanding of what his potential is. That's my fear. I'm terrified of it. I think about it all the time. I, I stepped back sometimes and I look at like the city of Los Angeles, of the skyline. All the lights go off and I'm like, this, this is all new. Like this has only been here for a few hundred years like this, this, there was nothing here. 1,700, there was nothing. This is nothing. Now look at it, it's all lit up and there's a gigantic grid you see from the sky, like what are we looking at 300 years from now? Like what? What are we looking at with all these things that were feverously attempting to build and create.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       Yeah. Well the, our dependence on the net is sobering. I mean, just what you just forget about all of these highfalutin fears of, of roguey. I just, just, we don't have a backup for the Internet and the Internet goes down. What happens in the real world a lot. That is, that is very difficult to recover from. You know, what happens to your money, right? I mean, what is money when there is no right or, or just just imagine some malicious code just destroying the record of, of uh, money, you know, just to getting into the banking system, right? So it's like you, you have men have to go look for the paperwork you may or may not have in your desk to argue that you have a certain amount of money because you know, all those bits got scrambled, right? Um, and we need some, all of this is just this, there's so many aspects of this, but the fact that you can now credibly fake audio, right?

Speaker 4:          00:51:21       So someone can listen to sample, you know, five minutes of this podcast and then produce a conversation. We've never had invoices exactly like our own. And those edits will no longer be discernible. I mean, we're basically there now and we're almost there with video, right where you could just have our mouths moving in the correct way. So I go to snapchat these crazy snapchat filters. I don't know if you know about these, but my daughter did pull up the one of my daughter being Abraham Lincoln. I mean, it's fucking crazy. I mean it's really rudimentary right now, but my six year old loves it. She thinks it's hilarious and she constantly uses it all the time. Like she just like, can I pay with your phone? And she grabs my phone and then she starts doing these little videos like somehow or another, their little brains like sync up immediately with the technology. Whereas if I gave it to my mom, she's be like, I don't even know what this is. What do I do? That six year old could figure it out like that. Check this out.

Speaker 8:          00:52:24       I lost my tooth

Speaker 4:          00:52:27       if I showed that, if I showed this to my daughters, you just never hear from them again. It would be the most captivating thing. I mean, this is obviously black and white and she's being silly and it's really obvious. Obviously it's fake, but man, how far. I mean this is thing in the world who looks like Abraham linking. It's mimicking the voice. You can't, like you see her, her mouth. You can't discern where her mouth ends and Abraham Lincoln's face begins. But here. But what's so insidious about this technology I'm talking about now is that someone can fake. I mean it's basically what is already true of Photoshop, right? Where you can't tell. You have to be an expert to tell whether the person was standing next to Donald Trump at the time because they could have just been put there, but with expert and expert use of Photoshop.

Speaker 4:          00:53:15       But now we're talking about being able to produce content where you are saying the thing that completely destroys your reputation, but it's pure. It's just fake news is just fiction. And so we need. I mean, I don't know what the fix where this is a, you know, I've just Spec, and this is again something I know very little about, but I've clearly something like the blockchain has to be a way of anchoring each piece of digital content so that there's like a chain of custody where you see exactly where this came from in a way that's not favorable. And so if I take, you know, your podcast and example, if someone is producing a clip that purports to be from your podcast where you're saying something insane, um, that just has to be a clear fingerprint digitally, which shows whether that came from you and Jamie or whether this came from some Macedonian hacker who just decided to screw with you.

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       Yeah. Well there's not. No, no, I know, but that clearly we need that. We need that tomorrow because the technology is here to produce totally fake content, which is. I am worried about that. I'm also worried about the idea that someone anywhere is completely in charge and knows what's going on. You know, I always point to you remember that guy that went onstage with Obama and pretended to be a sign language translator, that one that was really that this guy was South Africa or something like that. I believe it was, was it? That sounds right. But I forget where it was. Um, but, uh, but yeah, I mean that was amazing because it's just so few people read sign language that wasn't it around a Mandela. I don't know. I don't remember the details, but I remember thinking this fucking guy is three feet away from the president who was three feet away from the president and you would think that they had vetted everyone out.

Speaker 2:          00:55:10       So here's this guy talking and that guy is just completely making things up. He has no idea, has no idea how to do sign language and that, that, you know, that can happen. There was another incidence where a guy had gotten in an elevator with Obama, a security guard here with a gun, with a gun loaded gun in an elevator with Obama. Nobody's screened them. It's just people aren't really on the ball. You know, there was a bit for my last comedy special about the uh, guy that broke into the White House, but there was a woman guarding the front door by herself and they had shut the alarm off because it kept going off, so they had a fuck up, just shut it off. And then there was a guy who was on the lawn who's supposed to be, he had canines, supposed to be guarding lawn.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       He took his earpiece out to talk to his girlfriend on the cell phone. He had a backup, a walkie talkie because they have a backup one, but he left that in his locker. So it was like all these steps and this guy just hit the perfect sweet spot where you hopped the fence, ran the whatever, 100 yards plus to get to the White House, got to the door. It was unlocked, got through it. There was a girl by herself through her to the ground and just ran through the White House and was in there for five, 10 minutes. He had a knife, the knife. He

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       was basically trying to. He was basically a suicide by cop situation because they hadn't caught him. This is what's really hilarious when people think that the government is watching out for you. They weren't even watching this guy and listen to what this guy did. He got arrested. They pulled him over, I believe it was less than three months before that with 800 rounds of ammunition. He had two rifles, a shot gun and the ax and a machete and a map of Washington with a fucking x where the White House is and they let them go. They have. There has to be a crime there, but they weren't even watching that guy. Like the idea that they're watching you, but we're not built as a species for perfect vigilance. That's so not perfect. I mean, that's so ridiculous. Thinking about even the Tsa, you know, we, it's just, we're just, we're just not built for that.

Speaker 4:          00:57:21       Twitter and twitter can confound even the perfect vigilance, but just look what happened at the Oscars. That was just their only job is to get those envelopes right. You've got two people with briefcases and one guy starts tweeting and produces the wrong envelope. I mean, it's just. Is that what happened? He was tweeting. Yeah, he was tweeting. This is brutal, but he took a photo of. I forget what actress, but it clearly he was. I mean they have been deleted the photo, but people recovered it. Yeah, he. He took a shot of somebody I don't charlise their own or somebody who was walking backstage and put it on his twitter feed and then that. Then the very next moment was the moment when he had to hand over the right envelope and he just handed over the envelope for the best bankers, but that's been their only job is to get this straight, just safeguarding the envelopes so it's all adorable.

Speaker 4:          00:58:25       Yeah, there's some. There's something I really enjoy about the folly of people that. That's one of the main things that I worry about with ai that are the things that we find cute about us being ridiculous like that or like the sign language guy or any of these things, but that. But that's the thing that computers are really good at it. I mean one is computer to get good at this sort of thing, but we're programming them right now. But we, we can, we can program them to, to fill in the gaps for stupid. We want. What we want to do is automate repetitive behavior and error detection that we know we're not good at the moment. You have a, a TSA screening robot that, that doesn't get distracted. I mean these machines don't get distracted, right? They don't, they don't get hungry. They don't have to take bathroom breaks, they don't, they're not looking at the person who's looking at them and get captivated by some social glitch.

Speaker 4:          00:59:23       Right? So that it all, if you have a bomb screening robot, that's all it will do and it will be better once it, you know, whatever. Whatever they visual signature or of a, of a bomb is when you're talking about looking for one in a bag. Once computers get better at that than people they will be. They will be reliable in a way that people can never be. And then we know that about ourselves, so that's we want to, we want to outsource all of that stuff is driving is the perfect example, you know, you don't, you don't have self driving cars that are falling asleep or you know, will reading billboards and while they're driving at 80 miles an hour and um, and so we want that and, and, but the scary scary stuff is when it can change itself, that that's a principle that will allow it to kind of escape from our control or we just, we build something where we haven't anticipated the consequences and, and the incentives are wrong.

Speaker 4:          01:00:23       The incentive, the incentives are not aligned to make us prudent in the development of that and what an arms race is. The worst case for that because with the incentives are to get to the end zone as quickly as you can because the guy next to you is doing the same and you don't know how you don't know whether he's ahead of you or behind you. Right? And, and it's a winner take all scenario because the amount of wealth that will go to the winner of this race, if things work, if, if this person that doesn't know, if this group doesn't destroy the world is unimaginable. I mean, it's just, we're talking about a level of, of um, kind of windfall profits that we just haven't seen in any other domain. Well, perfect example is the creation of the atomic bomb. I mean, look at 70 years from the creation of the atomic bomb to today, which is literally a blip in human history.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       Just a tiny little blink of an eye. And then the United States emerges as the greatest superpower of the world's ever known. And that's going to be directly attributed to those bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mean that from there on, that's where everything takes off. When you look at human history, if you look at us from a thousand years from now, it's very likely that they look at that moment and then they go, this is the emergence of the American empire. But this is so much bigger than that because. Because the bombs, the power and the bomb was just, just the, the implicit threat that you might use them if you get pissed off. Right? But you can't do anything with the bombs here. We're talking about the resource that does everything. We're talking about intelligence. We're talking about. We're talking about the cure for cancer.

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       We're talking about the best virtual reality entertainment we're talking about. Uh, that the, everything, everything that a human being, once you, you're talking about general human intelligence and beyond, you're talking about now having access to suddenly having access to the smartest people who have ever lived, who never sleep, who never get tired, who never get distracted because now their machines and the smartest people who have never lived, right? People who are a thousand times smarter than those people and getting smarter every hour, right? And what are they going to do for you when they're your slaves, right? Because now you're talking about because you don't have to feed these people. These are working for you. Just how powerful would you suddenly be if you had 10,000 of the smartest people in the world working for you full time. They don't have to be fed, they never get disgruntled, they don't need contracts and they just want to do whatever Joe Rogan wants to do and get done and you just, you flip a switch and that's your company, right?

Speaker 4:          01:03:07       Um, that's some version of that going to happen. The question is, is it going to happen in a way that where we get this massive dislocation and in wealth inequality where all of a sudden someone's got a company and products and a business model which obviates, you know, 30 percent of the American workforce in over the span of three months, or you have some, some political and, and, and economic and ethical context in which we start sharing the wealth with everyone. And this, this is again, this is the best case scenario. This is when we don't destroy ourselves inadvertently by, by producing something that's hostile to our interests. Daniel terrified.

Speaker 3:          01:03:54       Yeah, no, this is. This is what hanging out with Sam does. Just listen. You spot. We get to a high spot, we get a pitcher of Margaritas and we just watched this whole thing. We're not gonna make it anyway. None of this room was going to live forever when I hang out with Sam, usually his wife's there. So it's like with the conversation is a little less elliptic. Yeah. Yeah. Well she keeps me grounded. She is actually awesome because when she's there she's like, just tooling on him and um, he giggles and stuff like that. It's like a completely different Sam than the guy who's under it, like being an undertaker here and telling you about how we're all going to die from Ai.

Speaker 4:          01:04:27       Yeah. She's, she keeps me honest. But um, I mean the truth is it's not. I mean, I'm, I'm cautiously. Whoa. This is, there's no way to stop. I mean, there's no, there's no brake to pull. Right. So it's like, this is the inevitability you were describing before. We're moving toward this thing because intelligence is the best thing in the world. I mean, intelligence is the thing that allows us to solve every problem we have or don't know we have. When we discovered what continually discovering new problems and the question is, what are we going to do? There's some global pandemic arrives and the challenges, do you find a vaccine for this thing or not? Right. Only intelligence solves that problem for us. We either, we either have the data and we can interpret it. We have to get that. We have to design the experiments to get the data. Um, and it's. So, it's, there's no question of us deciding while we've got. We're just going to stick with the intelligence we've got. I mean, we're just, we're not going to do that. We can't, we can, if there's other people that are working on it, it's exactly right because that's just too much power. Even if even if we decided that as an American policy, you know, we were not going to let China and North Korea and Singapore and Iran and Israel and all these other countries do it for us, so I'm fine,

Speaker 5:          01:05:52       but right above denver, big bucket of Margarita or, or, or the meditation that has helped a, that's, that definitely will help you. While human beings are a real thing.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       Yes. Although I wonder if you know, the getting enough people meditating might improve the quality of whatever gets created in the Ai community. In other words, if you have people who are a little bit more sane as a consequence of meditation than maybe a, the people designing these products that the rather these, uh, don't know if products the right word, this stuff that somehow this stuff is better.

Speaker 4:          01:06:33       Well, I think it's especially relevant for the other side of that which is when you mean in the near term, we clearly have a, an employment problem. I mean there, there are jobs that will go away that are not coming back and this is a perennial problem where people need to find meaning in life. But, but we've always had, it hasn't been such a pressing problem for thousands of years because there's always been so much to do just to survive. Right now what we're. In the ideal case, we'll get to a place where there's actually much less that has to be done because we have machines that do it and we have to. We have seen the wisdom of mitigating wealth inequality to some extent

Speaker 5:          01:07:20       bilevel were so every, so all, all boats

Speaker 4:          01:07:22       begin to rise with this tied to some degree, uh, so whether it's universal basic income or some. So we have some mechanism to spread the wealth around. But then there's the

Speaker 5:          01:07:31       question of what do you do with your life? So what do you think people will do that, that's the easiest one is not, but it's not so easy because people will. People are confused. People in St Louis need to get their shit together. I mean that, that's giving someone free time, but find a hobby man. I mean there's a lot of stuff to do. If you told me that I never had to work again, that we just have to find things to do all day and all my food and everything would be taken care of. That would be the easiest choice I've ever made in my life. I would just pursue things. I would just learn how to speak a language. I've learned how to play an instrument. I'd practice archery more. I do Jujitsu more. I don't. That seems to me, so riddick, that seems to me that can be solved really easy was a guy, but

Speaker 3:          01:08:12       I think that the. I'm not convinced I feel that I could fill endless swaths of of free time with a number of things that I'm interested in including but not limited to meditation or just hanging out with my two year old. However, I'm not sure that the vast majority of humans are like that

Speaker 4:          01:08:32       guidance. That seems to be the be the easiest thing to solve that. Just let them know it. Go find something fun to do. Can start running up hills, man, go up, take up Frisbee Golf. Just to shift to do. There's a lot of shit to do. My concern is that more and more it will. It will take the form of being merely entertained, so we'll plug into some vr.

Speaker 3:          01:08:55       Last scene of wally. I never saw that movie. Well, okay guys, you should maybe pull it, pull this up, but the. They're in wally. That's a dystopian future where everybody's riding around in those little jazzy. I'm a mobile wheelchairs that people sit, sit in Disneyland and they are also there. They've got huge buckets of soda and like Turkey legs and and draped like kind of hooked over the back of the, of their motorized vehicle as a monitor at the front, which is entertaining them. It was just obese and entertained and immobile or mobile, but not actually ambulatory

Speaker 4:          01:09:35       is Disneyland. What were. What's happened in our lifetime that the smartphone has made it virtually impossible to be bored. Boredom used to be a thing like you'd. You'd be sitting in the waiting room of a doctor, right? And they have crappy magazines and then you're just sitting there. So at the end, if you didn't know how to meditate, you had to confront this sense of on board right now, a while you just go. One thing you discovered when he learned how to meditate is boredom is just an inability to pay attention to anything and you can pay attention. Once you learn to pay attention to anything, even something as seemingly boring as your breath, it suddenly becomes incredibly interesting. So, so focused attention is intrinsically pleasurable, but boredom is the state of, of kind of scattered attention looking for something that's worth paying attention to. And yet now with technology, you're never going to be bored again. And I've got, I have at least 10 years worth of reading on my phone, right? So it's like if I'm standing in live, I, I'm constantly pulling this thing out as a bad thing. Well, it's, it's potentially a bad thing because you for images to take this example of, of one interesting insight you get when you learn to meditate.

Speaker 4:          01:10:54       It's incredibly powerful to cut through the illusion of boredom. I mean, to realize that boredom is, is not, is not something you can become interested in the feeling of boredom and the moment you do it bites its own tail and disappeared. I mean it's just like a, it's there no such thing as boredom when you're paying close attention

Speaker 3:          01:11:15       to your experience. I think the bad thing about the hyper stimulation that we get through our phone and, and all of technology is that we have lost the ability to just sit back and, uh, for lack of a less cliched term, B and w we're just constantly stimulated and that means we have trouble paying attention when we're holding our kid in our lap and reading him or her a book or we find ourselves without our technology for a moment. There was a recent study that asked people a, would you rather be alone with your thoughts or get electric shocks and a lot of people took the electric shocks and I actually think that is a fundamental problem, uh, in terms of not being able to get in touch with the Ra and kind of powerful, although obvious fact that you're alive and that you exist. Right? But

Speaker 5:          01:12:07       don't you think those people are idiots? I mean, you don't want electric shock. You don't want. I won't take an electric shock. You're not going to take an electric shock. We were talking about the dude with the snapchat. Jamie is on the ball. I don't want those glasses either, but you know what I'm saying. He doesn't use the glasses. He just explores it because it's fascinating. But you know what I'm talking about. I mean, we're not talking about rational people. We're talking about lowest common denominator. People that would take an electric shock, you would take an electric shock

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       study of they're not just picking idiot

Speaker 5:          01:12:37       are they asking and what? How are they phrasing the question, but it also doesn't. I have

Speaker 4:          01:12:40       to be conscious. So for instance, we, we willingly grant our attention to things which retrospectively we can judge produce more or less nothing but pain for us. So I was like, well, I mean I'm continually thinking about this and rethinking about this with respect to social media. Like I. So when I like what comes to [inaudible], what's the effect on my mind of looking at my twitter at mentioned? So I wondered that when you were asking people what kind of questions they said, yeah, we should ask what some of this podcast. Sometimes it's incredibly useful. I was thinking of what you're doing. You're opening yourself up to the green frog, but I've had both kinds of experience. I've had people send me articles that I would have never found otherwise and fascinating, super useful and it's just, it's like this is the perfect use of this technology and then again, then I, then I get this river of green frogs and weirdness, but the.

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       But the to the previous point, I pay attention to something for long stretches of time rather than do in something I know is good for me with my attention. I kind of spin the roulette wheel with, with twitter and rather often there's just this kind of toxic undercurrent of, of mental activity that it produces in me that I'm mean. It doesn't make me feel. I mean, it doesn't equip me to do anything better in life. It doesn't make me feel any better about myself or other people. I mean, if, if it has any net effect, it's. It basically grabbed a dozen dials that I can just sort of dimly conceive of in my mind and turn them all a little bit toward the negative. You know, I feel a little bit worse about myself, a little bit worse about my career, a little bit worse about people will go a little bit worse about the future, a little bit worse about the fact that I was doing this when I could have been playing with my kid or or writing or thinking productive thoughts or meditating or doing anything that I know is that you still do this twitter compulsion, you argue with people.

Speaker 4:          01:14:49       I found that fascinating. You. I go, I go for. I go for weeks without arguments as well, but also you argue with people on your podcast. Well, yeah, but that's, that's different. But I mean it. Just on the podcast you'll also be talking about people you're arguing with on twitter or a. So the arguing is a part of your. Well, I get trolled a lot on twitter. I get trolled. You have guests, you have guests who come on your podcast and savage me on the podcast and then troll me endlessly on twitter and abby. Abby Martin. Well she was. No, she doesn't try. I mean, she, she, she, she, she hates me, but she, I don't know. I haven't noticed her at trolling me, but no, you got in a room with her. Everybody would calm down. She just has. There's people that have radical misconceptions of who you are.

Speaker 4:          01:15:35       You. Yeah. I'm sure you heard the josh steps a patent Oswald thing or Patton Oswalt don't, don't listen to it because he went off the rails pack, went off the rails, like Hannibal style. When are you thinking of Andy Kindler? Oh yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That's good. So sorry. How do I connect patents? Great. Good patents. Very smart and very reasonable as is andy for the most, most of the time. But so, so the end is kind of discovered this very late. I did it. So I kept seeing this guy. I didn't know who he was. I kept seeing him in my twitter feed, Andy Kindler and they can learn and then I realized, wait a minute. He is actually, he seems to be mean. He's an established comic. He seems to be friends with people who I really respect who I don't know. Like, you know, like Sarah Silverman, who I don't know personally, I mean we've, we've communicated a little bit on twitter, but it's like I, I, I'm just nothing but a pure fan of Sarah, Jim Gaffigan, other big comics, so I totally respect.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       I don't know how close he is with these people, but he basically, he has endless energy for vilifying me as a racist and a bigot. Right. I mean he's just, he's a madman. And I discovered so I did a search of his twitter feed and he's got hundreds and hundreds of tweets where he's, he's going after me in the most retail way. So for instance, like I, I, I tweeted out a can anyone recommend 500 seat halls and all these cities and I think your friend is Duncan Trussell, a friend of yours. Okay. So Duncan wrote back saying, Oh yeah, Dma, I've got a great place in Boston or something. And then Andy kindler jumped into that thread talking to Duncan saying, don't help him, Duncan, he's a bigot. Right? So like he's like, this is Andy kindler just got endless energy for this. And then I, then I looked at what he was doing and he had been doing it for years and I wasn't aware of it just to you just to me and Bill Maher, he hates Bill Maher, but then you've got another guy on this podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:17:29       I'm hunter mats once. Okay. So he was on here and I actually had to go back and watch what he said here because I had been getting so much of this on twitter and I mean it's incredibly common. People are tweeting at me saying, why won't you debate hunter is, is Matt? Okay, why won't you debate hunter mass? I went back and looked at what he said here, you know, half of it frankly didn't make any sense. Um, but his attacks on me on twitter are the most juvenile. It's like the idea that he thinks this is a way he's going to establish a conversation with me by sending me to tweets and then sending me 400, which say you're scared to debate me. Right? Um, it's, I mean, I don't know, maybe it's very, very, very smart guy, but taking a terrible socially retarded approach to establishing a debate.

Speaker 4:          01:18:21       And I've contacted Brian Cowen about this and Brian Cowen contacted hunter about this. It's like, what the fuck are you doing? And he continues to do crazy behavior. He said he wouldn't do it anymore and then he gives more. I mean, every time I look, I, I see him somewhere in there, but then there's this guy, Mike Cernovich, who, who's actually has effects on the real world. I mean, Mike Cernovich is again, he's a twitter troll. Um, again, one of these other guys who's challenged me to debate him and uh, you know, I mean there's, there's, there's no, there's absolutely no possibility to suitable dialogue, spend less time on twitter, but Cernovich's was just on 60 minutes. I mean, he's like, he's in the world and he's affecting people's psyche. Oh yeah. Well, for sure. Right. Yeah. So they can come back. It's, it's not, it's not the nine times out of 10 looking just makes me think, um, I mean it's an illusion because if you met most of these people with you, if they came up to you at a conference or at a book signing or so, you know, after a Gig of yours and you thought you had more information about them, you saw all of the, you know, all of the crazy coming out, um, you would say, I don't have to pay any time.

Speaker 4:          01:19:33       There's no reason to pay attention to what this guy is saying. Whereas on twitter, everything is, has the same stature. So whether it's a Washington Post columnist who's tweeting at me or some, some guy like hunter who I had no idea who he is, but he's telling me I've got something wrong. Um, everything has the same stature and you just, there's no signal to noise sense of what you know. Well, first of all, you fucked up because you talked about them, both of them. You said candy man five times and now you've got a problem. You talked about him right now on this project, and this is the first time I've ever mentioned the gun out, but I'll go in and talk to you before this. I'm bringing it to you because you you, but you created it. I mean it was, it was, it was his.

Speaker 4:          01:20:14       It was his podcast with you. They kicked this whole thing on. 100 was going to do that and I know for a fact that hunter is actually a fan of yours. I think when hunter is trying got a strange way of showing it. I don't think it's a smart way. I think what he's trying to do and he, he, when I was trying to hold his feet to the fire and get some sort of a logical definition of what you do wrong, he really didn't have anything we'll hit but he thinks he does and he. But did he, when I talked to them about it and send half of what he said about Dawkins and me, it was totally wrong of what he said about the relevant biology was wrong. I mean he's just, he's not. He doesn't have his shit together, but he thinks he does and there's this, there's a, there's a level of arrogance and, and in civility and just kind of a lack of charity in, in interacting with other people's views, which is now kind of getting rebranded on the Internet as just just American can do Chutzpah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:16       Right? And it's like, it's, it's given us trump, right? It's like you've got a trump as the ultimate example. He's like the cartoon version of, you know, a person who doesn't know anything relevant to the enterprise, who doesn't show any aptitude for civilly engaging with differences of opinion. And this thing gets amplified to the, to the place of greatest prominence. Now in human history, everyone's on social media or many people on social media are playing the same game. And you know, Ms Dot Cernovich is another, you know, just malignant example of this where you have someone who's got a fairly large following. I mean, it's not as big as yours, but it's, you know, it's, it's a very engaged following. This whole trump phenomenon has, has, has, uh, shown me that Pete, that if a small percentage of, of one's audience can have like 100 times the energy of the rest of your audience, like whenever I went against trump on my podcast or this is still the case, the level of, of pain it causes in, in the sort of feedback space is completely out of proportion to the numbers of people who are, who are on that side of the argument.

Speaker 4:          01:22:31       And it's so. It's incredibly energized, but it's just this weird style of self promotion where you'd. All you do is that you brag about yourself, you say you're the best, you're, you're, you're, you're someone who has absolutely no basis to back up those claims. And yet an audience thrills to that level of arrogance and an empty boast. It's just bizarre. But well there's a, there's a big issue I think online where people find likeminded people and then they develop these communities where they

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       just support each other and they, they just have these, these gigantic groups of people. I mean, not even necessarily gigantic, but groups of people that find any subject, like for me, you know what it is flat earth, right? I get trolled by people all day that claim I'm a sellout because I don't believe the earth is flat, Mrs Reel. But, but don't think that there's a, there's a,

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       I think this phenomenon that you're describing is both, um, has really serious negative consequences. But it also has some beauty on the same. By the same token, you've got parents, uh, all over the world who've got children with a rare disease, but they can connect on the internet and bond over that and share tips and Dr. sure. So it is, it's actually, they're both outgrowths of the same kind of phenomenon, but he can be a, we see the, the really difficult, uh, uh, consequences of this in our politics right now, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 5:          01:24:04       I think we're talking about two different things. You think. So I'm talking about confirmation bias. I'm talking about a bunch of people that get together and say, yeah, obviously I'm woke in the earth is flat and pay attention. There's an analogy allows ball, yes it, but there are different things. The groups of people that will find communities where maybe your child has autism and there's some sort of an issue that can be mitigated with diet and parents have had some success with that and they could give you some enlightening information and you can communicate with each other and that's nice. It's beautiful and I'm some of the hashtags that people use that they find search through. It's great, but you know that these little communities that you bond, that they're not those those ideas. There's no confirmation bias in those ideas, but there's confirmation bias and the idea that trump is the man is confirmation bias and the idea that the earth is flat. You know, and if you just huddle in those little communities and just bark the same noises that everybody else barks, there's some sort of sense of community in that too. And people love that. They love being a part of a fucking team. Even if it's a stupid team of green frog

Speaker 3:          01:25:09       and you don't have it. You don't have to listen to other people's views and you get deeply, deeply entrenched. I think we're seeing. We're seeing this all through our politics and media right now.

Speaker 5:          01:25:20       Well, you also see when you go to those people's pages, which I do often, I don't engage with people in a negative way online very often. Very, very rarely. Do you not look at your ad mentions, are you? A little bit. But you know what, man, I just like to just go on about my day. I've found that the negative consequences that you're discussing, I rare. It's rare that I go down the rabbit hole and I go for days without looking at at mentioned. I mean it's more that if I publish something, if I asked for feedback, I want to see the feedback.

Speaker 3:          01:25:50       Silly. Did anything wrong? I mean, just as your friend. I mean I feel like there's nothing wrong with. I look at my app mentions, but um,

Speaker 5:          01:25:57       but you can function in a very different space. I mean, you're not pushing controversial stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:26:01       Definitely not. Definitely not. So I'm, I agree.

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       I'm just fine. I'm sorry, go ahead. No, I was just more worried about, again, back to your psyche like it feels like you need a a little bit of a middle ground. I stay offline after UFC is for the most part. That's when I get the most crazy. People said if there's any sort of a controversial decision, but are they criticizing you for something you said or they get fucking mad at my commentary. They'll just disagree with who I thought water and when they're so fucking vicious about it. I'm just like, just yell. Just yell on your own. You don't want to see any of that. There's too many people. You're dealing with millions and millions of people and who knows how many of them are rational when you're dealing with. You know, there's a bit that I had one of my specials where I was talking about the number of people that are stupid in the world.

Speaker 5:          01:26:46       Like if you get a room full of 100 people, the idea that one person isn't a complete fucking idiot. Of course you're being very charitable being shared in one, but if you do that, we're talking about 300 million people in the United States. Plus that's 3 million fucking idiots. Yeah, so if you have 3 million fucking idiots and all your ad mentions, if you look at your ad mentions and $3 million comments are saying you're a fucking moron and there's just too many people. The numbers are, they're not manageable. The numbers of human beings you interact with online are not manageable. So anytime anything gets negative or insulting, and I just check out. I just next, next, next. I don't pay attention because you can't. But if I fucked up and I know I fucked up, I think one of the most important things that I do is I admit that I fuck you and I talk about it and I apologize and I say, look, I'm flawed.

Speaker 5:          01:27:39       I'm human. I made a mistake. Sorry, and then just step away. Let the fucking chaos ensue and the comments, but all the people call you a shill and a whatever. Let all that happen, but don't let it in like you're letting it in and then you stew on it and you have to bring up, you know, a hunter and all these other people and you're letting them way too. No, no, no, no. I perhaps I gave a false impression of, of how under my skin this has gotten. Just the fact that you talked about it at all, those too much. Well, no, but I think it's a huge consequence and I think it's given us trump this way, this way. The fact that this style of communication is attractive to so many people. The fact that you can bluff and bluster and empty boast and lives with it being caught in lies without consequence.

Speaker 5:          01:28:28       Um, the fact that the people never admit mistakes. I mean the, the, the, what you just described to you, you do. And which I do, you know, you make a mistake. You want to hear about it. You want to correct it as quickly as possible, right? That is the antithesis of what we're seeing now in this space. I mean, it made when has trump admitted a mistake, but isn't the difference being that neither you nor I have any desire to control anything like I don't. I don't want to be the leader of anything. Well, no, but you want effective. Can we? You want good ideas too? I am sure and you want the truth to win. You want the truth to propagate. We want facts to

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       propagate. You want to be able to correct errors, whether they're your own or others, especially when they're consequential. And I think that we need a. We need a common ethic where align has real consequences. I mean, so many people are trying to figure out what's the antidote to fake news? Well, one antidote is to be caught. Line has to be devastating for your career, right? Like it hit politically, journalistically, academically as a, as a public intellectual. I mean to be caught in a whopping lie without a will require at minimum some serious atonement. And historically it has been absolutely

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       and it in many spheres

Speaker 4:          01:29:46       we have slipped those rails just to, to a degree that I've never thought possible. We're going lightspeed right into the woods. Yeah, I mean, we're talking about people have figured out how to, just to use dishonesty as extra fuel. I mean, it's like, it's, you know, the whatever the, the nitrous oxide boost in those hacky cars, right? It's like we can use this stuff, right. And the getting the way you behave when you get caught just, which is to say, just go fuck yourself. Just redounds to your credibility in your, among your tribe. Right. It's like this guy is so powerful. He, he, he, he, he so fully doesn't give a shit what people think that he can catch him in a lie and just watch how he, he gets out of it. Um, and, but that's, that's what, what, what, what I'm, when I was bringing up these guys, Mike Cernovich, I mean this, this is, um, I actually, I mean, I, I trolled Crna, I decided to troll Cernovich one day and I, I thought it was hilarious and I, it was just nothing but fun. So there was only topic about that. But, but the thing that bothers me is that this has real political consequences. And I think that this is a, this is a time period where we're in the sort of adolescent stage of communication online where you can get away

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       saying things that are dishonest and that there might be some sort of a way to mitigate that in the future. There might be some. I don't think we should act like dishonesty and bluff and bluster to use a phrase you used before is started somehow knew to the human repertoire. I get that. The acceptance of it seems to be though I think we're in a period where that is true and I think it is aided and abetted by technology and social networks. I agree with your diagnosis on many levels. But I, you know, I was having an interesting conversation with a guy that you introduced me to Joseph Goldstein, who was a, uh, eminent meditation teacher, become my meditation teacher, old friend of Sam's. And he was saying, we were talking about the current political situation. He used a phrase that I like when I was asking him what he thought about it, he said, I'm kind of slotting into geological time. And I think that actually makes some sense not to say that. What does that mean? Meaning that I'm just viewing it from a

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       far. I'm widening the Lens to look at the broad scope of human history to see that, you know, over time we've got these ups and downs. He's getting to the top of the mountain near Denver with a big bucket of Margarita. So that's exactly right. That's exactly right. I just lucked out with binoculars, watch the bombs go off, learn how to get water out of the ground, get a solar powered generator and make good Margarita. I mean, it just doesn't seem to me that this is sustainable. It feels like this is just going to be some spectacular moment in history where people were Rah Rah Nixon and now they look back and go, my God, Nixon was a fucking liar and a buffoon. I mean, take

Speaker 4:          01:32:44       this. This is a point I've made before and I don't think it's original with me. I think other people have made it, but my, my claim is that if trump were one 10th as bad, he would appear much worse. Because like everything he does now is as appearing against a background of so many lies and so much craziness that you can barely even weight its value. But yeah, I mean just so I just, uh, this is one of the things I find useful about twitter because I follow some very interesting people. And so Anne Applebom, The Washington Post columnist, it was just awesome on twitter. Everyone should follow her. She just keeps hammering trump with, with her own points and other stuff that she finds. And um, she just pointed out that. Did anyone notice that trumped trump threatened a war with North Korea two days ago? It was in the financial times and yet no one can talk about it because no one believes him, right?

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       Like, it's like, it's like we have a president whose speech has now become so denuded of truth value, right? Perceived truth value that he can say, you know, where if China doesn't handle North Korea, we're going to. And no one even feels like they have to ask a followup question on that topic because it just, everyone assumes as an empty bluff. I mean, images imagined, like you've just stepped back into the previous presidency of Obama had said, if China doesn't handle North Korea, we will write. That would be top of the fold. This is all we're talking about today, right? Like it's just comes out of a blizzard of, of inanity and craziness that, that, that, that, you know, he's, he's, he's going after Meryl Streep is, he's lying about Obama wiretapping him now his, he's threatening war with North Korea and you know, nobody knows what to talk about.

Speaker 4:          01:34:42       So it's like the, the, the consequence of this is we have a president who not only can he not be trusted to tell the truth, he can be trusted to lie when ever he thinks that suits his purpose. And now so, so, so the, the, the, the state of mind that everyone's in, including the press in listening to him is just his to take potentially the most serious things in the world. Not seriously and the least serious things in the world. Like, you know, Meryl Streep or what he thinks of her acting, you know, that becomes a, that dominates a whole new cycle. It's very upside down, it seems to be to be quite new as opposed to the or are perennial, but I feel like we're in a very different space now with the consequences of of misinformation and we certainly are. Do you think that they're connected to what we're talking about before we said that people would rather be electrocuted than to be alone with their thoughts that we have gotten to this weird place with our society, with our civilization where we've made things so easy and made people so soft, so dependent upon technology.

Speaker 4:          01:35:51       We've slotted out these paths, these predetermined patterns of behavior to people for people to follow where they can just sort of plug into a philosophy, whether it's a right wing or left wing, one with very little room for personal thought at all. Very little room for objective reasoning. We've sort of made it easy. We baby.

Speaker 3:          01:36:09       I do think that it's imperative if you want to be a good citizen to have a varied media diet, you're not going to have a clear view of the world. If all you're reading it well for the New York Times, you know, I think you have nothing against the New York Times or bright part, but I think you need to read many things and follow up many different sorts of people on twitter, not just because you want to troll them, but because you actually want to listen to what they have to say and take it serious. Well, the New York Times really fucked up where they're really fucked up is well, they said that they're going to

Speaker 4:          01:36:40       the election. They're going to rededicate themselves to reporting the truth and read like, what? Why'd she say that? Like, I wish I was there. I wish I was in the office. Why? That just sends the wrong message. We weren't into the truth that says they are biased. They fucked up. I mean, as they were by saying, you're right, the enemy is, is was so grotesque in this case that it was impossible to not have been biased. Seemed an abdication of responsibility and I feel it myself like people. Everything I say against trump from a trump person sounds like mirror partisan bias. There's zero connection to the Democratic Party or two. I mean it's like, uh, there's, there's no partisan bias and that every 100 percent of what I want to say about trump does not apply to some other Republican who, who, uh, is just a stands for things that I don't know, policies I might not like. It's completely, completely unique circumstance and um, yeah, so I mean it's true that you went to read the New York Times for the longest time it was, it was reading like just the thing had become

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       the opinion page on the Huffington post or something. Yeah. I just feel like at this stage of our, our society, there's real consequences to the infant tylenol if that's actually a word of, of human beings in our culture. We've made it very easy to just go to work and just get home and watch television and just not pay attention to anything and not read anything and not really think and, and then be manipulated. I mean, I think it's incredibly easy to manipulate people, especially people that are aware that they don't have a varied media diet. People that are aware that they don't have a real sense of the word and there seems daunting to try to take into consideration like what is, what is involved in foreign policy, what is involved in dealing with Russia, what is involved? How do you negotiate with North Korea? Fuck, it's too much. Put it in the hands of the strong man.

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       This is true on both sides of the spectrum though because I think we've got folks um, who, who slot into just a, a, a media diet where they're just hearing things on the left and they're not, they're not curious about or uh, um, I guess just just not curious enough to hear things from a different perspective unless it's just some right wing political who comes on and they beat them up. Um, so I, I, I, I really do think and I think it put places, and this is going to be a self serving argument, but I do think it places increasing important sun media outlets like the one for which I work to be really vigilant about being seen as fair arbiters or fax.

Speaker 5:          01:39:32       Yeah. I think the consequences have never been greater for that. Absolutely. The reason that so many people on the right, somebody trump's support supporters fear, feel like they're right is because it has been proven that the media was biased and that they did get it all wrong and they were absolutely wrong when it came to who was going win. The huffington post has some ridiculous thing where it was the night of the election and they said that Hillary had like a 98 percent chance of winning or something crazy like that. Well, I think there were some polls that were bad, but the pole like the, because I remember this because I sent out a tweet which said like by, by Donald or something like that, the day of. But when I did that, I mean that wasn't a prediction and the, the, the polls that I was going by that most people were going by that point, it was like 80 slash 20, you know, or at best 75 slash 25 that she was going to win. Now that's not. I mean, you roll dice for a few minutes, you realize 20 percent chance comes up a lot, so I guess that's infinite test. Melodic plus Florida. Yeah, but, but, so, but. Well, you should, you should tell the story about what it was like to anchor. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:40:39       well I guess. Yeah. So I was anchoring the ABC News digital coverage that night. Um, and uh, you know, they, they give you the exit polling, well you're not supposed to report it publicly, but the exit polling that we were seeing before we went on the air late in the day really made it seem like it's going to be a Clinton landslide. And now you have all these folks who say, look at the crest fallen faces of the journalists because they're so upset that trump won. Certainly that was not the case for the folks on my set was that it was, that we didn't see it coming. We weren't prepared for it. Everything that we're seeing in terms of the math made it look like this was a Clinton victory. A shoe in. It was just about just tying a ribbon around it. So when the night became long, there was just confusion about what was going on, how do they get it so wrong. You know, I think it actually goes back to what Sam was saying before that people think when you see numbers like 70 percent is that Clinton's going to win 80 percent odds that Clinton's going to win that, that she's definitely going to win. But there's room there for trump to a lot of room there for whatever

Speaker 5:          01:41:46       present comes up all the time. It's Russian roulette bills or bad. If it's Russian roulette, those are bad odds. Right? You're not going to take that one single bullet, right? Yeah. No, you're a hunter. Yeah. That's really good. Awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:42:01       I don't think so. It's so much about blaming the polls as it was blaming the overall tenor of the coverage, which made it seem like Clinton was inevitable. Yeah. Yeah. It just, it was. It was so shocking. That's a hit. That's a hit. I think that we, we can and should take. Yeah, we definitely know. I think we, we weren't giving the 20 or 30 percent chance a serious enough look.

Speaker 5:          01:42:25       What is your thought as being someone who covers these things? What is your thought about the electoral college? Do you think that that's an antiquated idea and then, I mean, it was kind of established back when you really needed a representative because otherwise you would have to get on a fucking horse and ride into Washington and it would take six months.

Speaker 3:          01:42:41       I can see the, you can make very powerful arguments that it's deeply problematic institution. I can see the, I can see the power of those arguments for sure. Um, there are people who argue make similar arguments about the United States Senate. Yeah. Um, uh, there was, uh, there was a piece that ran in the New York Times, uh, in their Sunday we can review not long after the election making the case that the angriest people in America actually should be those live on the coast because it's taxation without representation that we, that the people who live on the coast are paying more in taxes, but they have less representation actually in Washington. Um, again, this, I, that's not research that I've done, but it's an interesting idea.

Speaker 5:          01:43:26       Have you ever seen anybody present any sort of a logical argument that there really shouldn't be a president anymore, that the idea of having one alpha champ run this whole thing seems pretty outdated and just not sure that he runs the whole thing, but he's got a lot of info.

Speaker 3:          01:43:42       It's an enormous amount of influence, but, but we're seeing Donald Trump is seeing right now the limits of presidential power. He couldn't get his, uh, the healthcare bill that they, that didn't even make it wasn't even close to what he promised on the, or in some ways wasn't even close to what he promised in the campaign trail. In other words, he couldn't get the bill that he wanted and then he couldn't get that passed. And now he's looking at having to watch his party employed the nuclear option in order to get a, his supreme court nominee a seated. So I, I don't know. I think that the founders designed in many ways a really ingenious system and we put a lot of attention on the president because it's one person who get who's in our on our TV screens or our phones all the time, but I'm not sure how much power is vested in that person. Now when it comes to foreign policy, it's a different kettle of fish.

Speaker 5:          01:44:38       Well, it's enough that the EPA has been sort of hobbled. I mean what they've done with the environmental protection agency standards, especially when it regards to emissions. He's rolled back emission standards. I mean there's anything that we should be concerned about. It's the air that we breathe and we are moving in a direction we. We're clearly moving in a direction to get away from things like coal and he's going the opposite way. Not only that, but what I've heard is that that's not even going to be effective because most places have moved away from coal to the point where restarting coal production is not even gonna recharge the economy in the way that would make it a viable option in the first place.

Speaker 3:          01:45:20       The issue of climate change is just, um, I'll say as a member of the media and area where I feel, I'm just speaking for myself, I'm really one of our biggest failures, um, and I don't think history is going to go just kindly and I get off, I'll put the blame on myself. It's become, it's a hard story to get people just interested in, um, and especially for television because it's a lot of sort of graphs and science. Um, and you, there's only so many pictures of polar bears you can show. Um, and so I've, I anguish about that because I do think it's, it's, uh, there isn't a debate. Climate change is real, almost certainly caused by humans. I don't think we. And for too long we fell for that in the media where we presented it as a debate when it wasn't a. Now I think we're past that, but I still don't think we're covering it enough and as robustly as we should.

Speaker 5:          01:46:18       Climate change I think is very sort of almost abstract to people. It's very difficult for them to wrap their head around, especially when they look at the ice core samples and there's plenty of stuff online where you could sort of convince yourself that there's always been this rise and fall of the temperature on the earth. In many ways that is true, but pollution is another thing. I think. I think actually I just walked in so I might have missed what you said there, but I think that's a crucial shift of emphasis. There is no

Speaker 4:          01:46:51       argument about air pollution runs consequences. It's undesirability. I mean like you don't want particulates in your lungs that you don't need to have there. And the idea that we could see, you could completely justify a green economy on that basis alone. Maybe it just imagine if we had no pollution coming from the exhaust of all the cars out there and there was no coal fired power plants. We just had solar and wind and and you know, safe nuclear technology powering the grid. It will be fantastic from just a pure. I mean forget about the health. It just taught me the, obviously cancers is, is a lung cancer and, and cardiovascular diseases is a huge issue there. But just aesthetically it's, it's so desirable. I mean, there's no argument against it and that's, I feel like people don't make that connection

Speaker 3:          01:47:45       because climate change is slow moving, you know, and it could be way out in the future before pollution isn't. I know, you know, but it pollution is a much less controversial than climate change. Well, that's why this coal thing, so disturbing. Reigniting this production of coal. Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's ridiculous. I mean, I guess I have questions about whether it's even going to happen. In other words, you can roll it back. But the coal industry, there are many, many, uh, they, they are many factors to their decision making about, for example, will, if they go and do the mining is, is what they, uh, a mine going to actually even be consumed. So I uh, you know, and I, I think that even though they're doing some pretty radical, making some pretty radical noises at the EPA, I'm not sure how far pruitt can, can take some of this stuff given the existing body of law case law that has formed around a Obama's decisions. So I think it gets, it gets pretty more complicated the closer you look at it, from what I can tell and I won't claim to have studied it too too closely, but it seems to get more complicated. The more you look at it, the headlines maybe scarier, I guess is my point. Well, what's pretty clear though is emission standards rolling

Speaker 5:          01:49:02       back emission standard sends a very clear message that it's okay to pollute the air. I mean it's, we were moving in a direction of going towards electric cars, going towards cars that pollute the environment less. I mean even cars that use gas, you know, for a Porsche, porsche has a nine slash 11 turbo and the standards of emissions are so strong. What they've developed as a car that you drive it through La, the exhaust that comes out is cleaner than the air. It sucks in.

Speaker 4:          01:49:30       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:49:31       Imagine that you're driving through. It's an air filter. Yeah. It really is bad air filter. It can be done very expensive hair filming. It can be done. I mean that's. I mean, and we can move further and further away. I mean obviously the problem with that is it's taking in polluted air. That's the issue in the first place. I mean it's not clean. You don't want to breathe the exhaust of a Porsche, but what they've done is managed to make something so efficient that it actually does emit clean air coming out of it or cleaner than the polluted air that it's sucking in. Now, if these environmental protection agency standards keep getting rolled back, I mean we're going to go back to. I mean I don't know how far the rolling it back, but what you said is so clear. There's nothing good about polluting the air. I mean it's what we need to breathe and there's options. The idea that business should take precedent over the actual environment that we need to sustain ourselves.

Speaker 3:          01:50:27       So let's not forget there are a real human beings in coal country who have generations of, I've done, have spent generations working in the industry, take great pride in it, and we've got to think about what we do.

Speaker 4:          01:50:42       It's only the numbers here as uprising and also little reported. It's only 75,000 coal jobs we're talking about in the country and there's something like 500,000 clean tech jobs just in California alone. I mean, the numbers are completely out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       No, I think. I think the cleantech to, um, uh, industry offers an enormous amount of promise, but 75,000 families is not nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:51:07       And when we're talking about and give them money, they don't want to end up going to work. This goes to the question of meaning and you know, like what are we going to do? Because we're on the precipice. We're getting to is everyone. Virtually everyone is going to be in the position of these coal miners. When, when you were talking about and that that's a good thing. That's the thing, I mean, that's, that's why can't they figure out that they just want to learn new languages and spend more time with their kids and play Frisbee and, and uh, have fun. We need a new ethic that and politics that decouples a person's claim on existence from doing profitable work that someone will pay you for. It says a lot of that work is going on.

Speaker 3:          01:51:51       We could, I mean, we could view it as an opportunity and it is actually something that it does dovetail with this hobby horse that you and I have been on for awhile about, about, um, kind of about the power of meditation and what it can do to a human mind and the way you view the world and your role in it. For sure.

Speaker 5:          01:52:08       What are you thoughts on universal basic income? Because bring, bring it back to that with this rise of the machines. If we do have things automated, I mean some ridiculous number of people make their living driving cars and driving trucks now when that, when those jobs are gone, I think it's millions of people.

Speaker 4:          01:52:24       It's, I think it is in the states, it's the most common job for white men. I think something like 9 million white men are driving trucks and cars, and the problem with that is most people like fuck white men, white men, patriarchy. This is trump's. Yeah, no, it's these, um, I think universal basic income. There, there reasons to worry that it's not a perfect solution because you do want, you want to incentivize the things you want to incentivize you to. You need to just understand the consequences of, of any system you would put in place, but there's just no question that in the viewed as an opportunity, this is, this is the greatest opportunity in human history. We're talking about canceling the need for dangerous, boring, repetitive work and freeing up humanity to do interesting, creative, fun things. Now, how could that be bad? Well, give us a little time and we'll show you how we can make it bad, but it'll, it'll be bad if it leads to just extraordinary wealth inequality that we have.

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       We don't have the political or ethical will to, to fix. And because if we have a culture of people who think I don't want any handouts and I certainly don't want my neighbor to get any handouts and I don't want to pay any taxes so that he gets, he can be a lazy bum if that's the, if we have this, you know, hangover from, from, uh, uh, calvinism, you know, that makes it impossible to talk creatively and reasonably about what has changed. Yeah. That it could be a very painful bottleneck we have to pass through until we get to something that is, that is, um, much better or a hell of a lot worse depending on, on where the technology goes. And I think at a certain point the, the wealth inequality will be obviously unsustainable. I mean, you can't have multiple trillionaires walking around living in compounds with razor wire and just moving everywhere by private jet.

Speaker 4:          01:54:39       Um, and then, you know, massive levels of unemployment in a society like ours. I mean, at a certain point where the richest people will realize that enough is enough. We have to spread this wealth because otherwise people are just going to show up at our compounds with, with their ar fifteens or their pitchforks and you know, that the society will not sustain it, mean you can't use the, there has to be some level of wealth inequality that is unsustainable that people, people will not tolerate. Um, and you begin to look more and more like a banana republic until you become a banana republic. But now we were talking about, you know, the US or, or the developed world where all the wealth is a. So redistribution is the end game. We and that's that. But that's a toxic concept for half of the country right now where the idea of the welfare state in perpetuating that and spreading it across the board.

Speaker 4:          01:55:41       Yeah. But these are so, yeah, I mean, whatever the solution is for coal mining, we should not be hostage for the coal miners. We should not be hostage to the idea that they need jobs so that whatever job they were doing and are still qualified to do that job has to continue to exist no matter what. No matter what the environmental consequences, no matter what the health consequences, no matter well how it closes the door to good things that we, we want, we don't do that with any that we didn't do that with the people who are making buggy whips or, or anything. Slavery. Yeah. Or Yeah. I mean that's just, there's no, I'm at a certain point we move on and we make progress and we don't let that progress get rolled back. And when you're talking about a developing technology that produces energy that doesn't have any of these negative effects, um, you know, whether it's global climate change or just pollution, of course we have to move in that direction.

Speaker 4:          01:56:47       And the other thing that's crazy is that we're not talking honestly about how the dirty tech is subsidized. I mean, you have the oil. People say, well, solar is all subsidized, right? This is, is this a government handout that's given us the solar industry? Well, one, that's not even that you have to produce an argument as to why that's a bad thing. We, this is something we should want the government to do. The government needs to incentivize new industries that the market can't incentivize. Now, if there are industries that are just intrinsically good and are going to lead to the betterment of humanity, but carbon is massively subsidized. We Ha, we don't have, I mean if we actually had the, the, the coal producers, um, and the, and the petroleum producers pay for the consequences of, of carbon and pollution. It would be, it would be much more expensive than it is, right?

Speaker 4:          01:57:44       So it's already subsidized, you know, we do it. So we should, I mean, we, we, we need a carbon tax. Clearly we need to the tax code to incentivize what we want to incentivize. Well, there's a ton of industries in this country that you could make that argument for. The corn industry is one subsidizing the corn industry and when you find out the corn and corn syrup is responsible for. I'm just a huge epidemic of obesity in this country. And the amount of corn syrup that's in foods. If you have USA, USA polluter had to pay the, the consequences of your pollution all the way down the line, right? Um, you had to compensate everyone who got emphysema or lung cancer because of what you were putting into the air, your industry, it would be less profitable, right. And it might not be profitable at all and that's, and we don't have, we haven't priced all of that in to any of things, whether you're talking about, you know, the, the chemical industry or, or, or the industry. I mean, we're, we're, we're addicted to the use of these fossil fuels the same way we're addicted to some people are addicted to the use of cigarettes when the health consequences of those things are there, they're almost parallel and a lot of ways. Yeah. Well and amazingly, as you have the same, I mean, I think you turned me onto this documentary. What was it, merchants of doubt that the same phds you got like 10 guys who moved from India, you know, just toxic industry to toxic industry defending whether it's big tobacco or the.

Speaker 3:          01:59:17       I'm in the document a, I interviewed a guy named Fred Singer who was one of these people. Uh, and uh, he's a climate change denier and there's just some, um, it's been awhile that it was, there were some key moments where I was like listening, listening for him, all the major scientific organizations that say that climate change is real and that humans are our major contributors to it and he basically just refused to accept it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:47       Those shows where you have the three heads, you and then the two experts and they yell over each other and then we'll, we'll be right back. And then you go to commercial fucking things on solving anything, those weird moments where people are yelling at each other and you can't figure out who's right or who's wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:00:02       I'm not a big fan of that personally. And I think that especially it was a failure to do that with climate change because it, it, it created the doubt, it created the doubt. Um, and I think that was a very successful. It was a very successful strategy.

Speaker 4:          02:00:20       But, but that's intention intention with what we just said about the New York Times. Because if you, if you take a position as a journalist, if you say, okay, actually one side of this conversation is full of Shit, then you seem like you're not an

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       information. I think it's different to take us a, a position. I don't know. It's not controversial for me to sit here and say, if you smoke cigarettes, uh, the science strongly suggest you have a higher odds of lung cancer. Same thing with climate change, but it became politicized. So I don't feel. I don't, you'll notice I've stepped out of some of the discussions that have been taking place because it's not my role as journalists to come down on one side or another. But with climate change, I feel absolutely comfortable saying this. The, the, the, the vast majority of scientists believe this is real and a big, big problem. So I don't what, what you're talking about with the New York Times and I don't really. I'm not going to step out and take a view on it, but what, what I believe you're saying with the times is that they were pro Clinton and anti trump. That's different from having a position on climate change.

Speaker 4:          02:01:25       Well, it's not. Well no, because they have a position on just just take the Lens as climate change. You have one candidate who's denying the reality of climate change. Where? Who's, who's just claiming that the, the Chinese trump? Well, no, because it was. Because when trump says climate change is a Chinese hoax, you have to call him. Here we go. He said it's a Chinese hoax, so he should go to China and see those people that are walking around with gas masks on because they can't breathe in Beijing. Okay. But that's, I mean, that's, that's the pollution argument, which I think is actually much stronger because just you can't go to Beijing and say this is how we want the air to be. Right? Uh, but I think something like 20, I think something like 25 percent of the air pollution in California on some days is coming from China.

Speaker 4:          02:02:18       Maybe there's some amazing. I could have that slightly wrong. Jamie can check that out, but please do. There's some, there's some extraordinary amount of air air pollution that we get from China. That's insane. I did not know that yet. Just makes its way across the ocean. There's no wall build that wall. Um, but no, but at a certain point, I mean there's some, there's some level of dishonesty and misinformation that's so egregious that if you're a journalist, commit at all committed to being an unbiased or disinterested broker of information and a conversation. If you set up a conversation between, you know, the Sean Spicer's of the world or, or the Kellyanne Conway's who have their alternative facts and someone who's honestly talking about whatever it is, climate change, um, it's very, you know, you can't split that baby,

Speaker 3:          02:03:09       but I don't think you have to create mock unnecessary debates around climate change. What I do think is that, uh, with the trump administration, uh, that it is imperative for journal that journalists a call out, uh, when things are said that aren't true, but that I don't think it's constructive for mainstream journalistic organizations to have an openly hostile anti trump attitude or pro somebody else attitude because then you lead. That just leads to further polarization. But when it's exactly what we don't need,

Speaker 4:          02:03:43       but you call him out on all the times that he said things that were just absolutely not true. Absolutely. It was like you're anti trump. Yes it can.

Speaker 3:          02:03:49       There's no question. There's no question. And I think that's a issue we're dealing with and I, but I think this is a time of real soul searching in my industry because I, I firmly believe there is a very powerful place in a functioning democracy for a press, for, for media that people generally view as fair.

Speaker 4:          02:04:10       Well, it's also really highlights the responsibility of getting accurate and unbiased information to people because there's not a lot of sources of that left. Mean when you look at Fox News and sometimes you look at CNN, sometimes you look at him and Msnbc and you're like, boy, how much of this is editorialized? How much of this is opinion? You know it. You need unbiased facts and you almost need it not delivered by people. You know, the

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       problem is when, when people are delivering the news, like I, I, when you talk to someone, you know, they're educated in an ivy league university and they speak a certain way, they act a certain way. You almost kinda assume that these intellectual people, these well read people are going to sort of lean towards one way or another.

Speaker 3:          02:04:58       I think that there, there is that issue. I, I, I would argue, and again I know this is self serving, but I still believe it, that the three broadcast networks have actually fared quite well in what is a incredibly difficult environment, right? So you don't Count Fox as a broadcast network. Fox News as a cable network, but Fox, uh, but they don't have. Fox broadcast does not have a news division. ABC, CBS and NBC do

Speaker 5:          02:05:25       so just broadcast meaning traditional old school signaling the air that nobody uses anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:05:31       Nobody uses them. But we will refer to them within the industry as the three broadcast. And that bizarre though it is, it is. Well, some people, you know, they put up their rabbit ears and get the signal. Fuck those cord cutters, extreme cord cutters. Jv He got was 20 bucks if I get like 30 channels and it's way better and it works. There's no lagging, there's no buffering. You do that. And then you get like Netflix for Hulu and I have sling. But when I wanna watch a basketball game like this, the Ncaa basketball tournament last night, I had to walk through the air at work. Really good. Wow. Interesting. It's like a collection tool. What's the, what's the viewer benefits on a, um, an evening news broadcast. And I was like 5 million now it's around eight or nine. Yeah. So this is a really big number.

Speaker 3:          02:06:16       I don't know, I don't follow all of the, uh, ticks, um, when it comes to the numbers, so I can't answer that accurately, but people have been predicting the demise of network news for decades now. Every, you know, I've been at ABC news for 17 years. I've been reading obituaries all throughout that time. Eight dollars million a night on each of the networks is still out. That is a gigantic number, especially in an age of complete, you know, of micro, uh, information of niche broadcasting and uh, the Internet. It's all that. Here are the numbers right there,

Speaker 5:          02:06:52       NBC. So ABC's in the lead

Speaker 3:          02:06:55       ABC is the lead in total viewers. Uh, so and ABC and NBC and this is just one week, March 27th right around eight. And then CBS is six point five. So gets a lot of people excuse super old though because it does because that demographic, absolutely as soon as excused. Very, very old.

Speaker 5:          02:07:09       Well, it's all people. That's the majority is people over 54 or under 25, but I don't think that's the case at 25 to 54. ABC as one point. 6 million as opposed to a 8 million total viewers. NBC, seven, eight, seven point 8 million total viewers. One point 7 million. Twenty five to 54. And then CBS, six point $4 million total. One point $3. Twenty five to 54. It's funny. Like after 54. Fuck you put before 25. Fuck. You concentrate on this one.

Speaker 3:          02:07:43       It is what advertisers want. It's funny, the vitality.

Speaker 5:          02:07:48       Yeah, it's gonna be the ads, the ads you run. It's like, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:07:53       that are anti inflammatory in, on the morning because in the morning shows where we're also, it's more, it's closer to four or $5 million for ABC and NBC and a little less for CPS. Uh, the percentage of that audience that falls within the demo as we call it, 25 to 54 is higher. And so the ads are kind of different. But I guess my point is that you still have a really significant number of people if you take the mornings and evenings on these broadcast networks that are getting their news from these places, which just gets back to the polarization, the polarized media atmosphere you were talking about before. I think in this atmosphere that the, that having the networks be seen to a certain extent. To the extent possible as above. The fright actually is important for democracy is Alex Jones get was I think 40 million a week, but they include like a website hits and they're big number. So it's a skewed number. I've spent some time with him to have you know him very well. I went down to Boston and I went down to Austin and sent. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How long a basically spent a day at hanging around his operation. This was, and I would say 2009. It was a while ago before the monolithic. Pretty big back then, but not what it is now

Speaker 5:          02:09:14       in 1999. Alex Jones and I put on George Bush, senior and junior masks and we smoked pot out of a bong and then danced around the white, not the White House, the capital building in in Texas for a standup video that I did. Yeah. I've been friends with that guy since 99. I listened. I listened to your recent podcast with, which was just it'll dimensional child molesters that are infiltrating our airwaves. Yeah, he, he went deep. We got them high and drunk and he went. It's amazing. He went as deep as he's ever gotten before.

Speaker 3:          02:09:48       Do you find that he is different when he's not being recorded? Uh, yeah. Are there, is there, is screaming and yelling.

Speaker 9:          02:10:02       That's him singing, by the way.

Speaker 5:          02:10:14       No, it's the. He made up these lyrics. This song is all him. I believe he might've ad libbed it to give us. Give me some volume on this.

Speaker 9:          02:10:22       Oh, that was the name of my dvds, belly of the beast from Austin, Texas. Strap yourselves. That's Alex.

Speaker 5:          02:10:39       he's so crazy. I mean, he's definitely different when he's not being recorded, but he is that guy, you know, he believes it's sincere. People leaves all this stuff. He believes a lot of it. I mean, whether it's correct or not, that's a different argument whether or not he believes it.

Speaker 3:          02:10:58       I was struck and we had, I spent a full day with them and then we had dinner with him afterwards who were not recorded. And uh, I was struck by the difference in demeanor, uh, off camera and not being rent.

Speaker 5:          02:11:11       Yeah, there's definitely that. I mean, not saying that,

Speaker 3:          02:11:13       leave it. I don't know. I'm not gonna. I can't, I'm not sure.

Speaker 5:          02:11:17       He's a showman for sure. What's really disturbing is when he gets stuff right. You know, like the World Trade Organization is a perfect example. He was one of the ones that highlighted the use of a agent provocateurs now what agency, who hires these people, but what they do is they take something like the WTO, which was a big embarrassment that people were protesting the WTO and they hire people to turn this peaceful protest into a violent protest, so these people come in, they were ski masks, they break windows and they light things on fire or do whatever they do that makes it violent and then they have the cops come in and break it up because now it's no longer a peaceful protest and so it got to the point where people were trying to show up for work. They had WTO Pinzon that aligned through it well.

Speaker 5:          02:12:01       They had created a no protest zone and they were taking his on footage on the news. They were telling people, you have to take the pin off. You can't go through this area where you work with a WTO pin on your backpack or on your jacket. I mean, that's crazy, and he highlighted that and made a in that use of agent provocateurs has been documented. This is a real thing and it's a real tactic that again, what agency, what, what faction of the military would fashion the government hires these people to do that I don't know, but it is a real thing and I did not know about that until Alex highlighted it on one of his V, one in one of his videos. It's been proven. It's been proven that it's real and so that alone is disturbing when you stop and think about all the different things that he's informed.

Speaker 5:          02:12:48       People of that turned out were real like operation northwoods when the freedom of Information Act came out with the operation northwoods document where the Joint Chiefs of staff at sign this and this was something that they were really trying to implement. They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them attack, wanted them obey. They were going to blow up a drone jetliner. They're going to blame it on the Cubans and they were trying to use this as impetus to get us to go to war with Cuba. You have, but how do you feel about the things that he's talking about that are well, okay, but let's talk about that first. I mean, there are things that are true. That's what gets really squirrely. What gets really squirrel. He's like when when you find out that there have been things like the Gulf of Tonkin incident, like there's many things that have happened where there have been false where the government

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       has conspired to lie to the American people and people have died because of it I think will. I don't know a lot about Gulf of Tonkin, but although I know more about it than than those other examples. I mean there are definitely cases where it's an additional interpretation to say that the government lied to take even something that's closer to hand. Like we have weapons of mass destruction as a pretext to go into Iraq right now. It's one thing to say that people knowingly lied about that Bush and Cheney knowingly lied to the American people about that or they were misled by people who are knowingly lying or just everyone got it wrong. Yeah. Like it was just. It was. It was totally plausible to everyone who was informed that he had a WMD program and they misinterpreted whatever evidence they thought they had and they were just wrong.

Speaker 4:          02:14:26       Now. So that's a spectrum. I'm not claiming to know which one of those is true. I think it's probably probably the last is much closer to the truth and that explains many of these instances. But the, the, I mean that was so corrosive about pure examples of line, um, is that, uh, and we may have one case now this just emerging in the news. I don't know if the, maybe the, the, the story has been clarified while we've been talking, but this is now seems that Susan Rice came out at one point, she said she knew nothing about the unmasking of, of trump associates in this recent surveillance case. And now it seems that she is claiming that she actually asked to have certain names, unmasked and stuff like this. This is being seized upon again, just in the last few hours as an example, an example of a lie.

Speaker 4:          02:15:22       Right? Which seems very sinister. I'm at, but as though it equalizes the two sides here, right? Let's low. So let's say worst case scenario, Susan Rice lied about having some knowledge of this investigation. Um, that doesn't. It says something bad about Susan Rice. It says something. I mean, she has to deal with the consequences of that lie, but it doesn't exonerate all of the line that trump has done about everything under the sun. Right? So w what so destabilizing here is at the moment, the moment ms dot even true of honest errors, the moment that a news organization like yours or the New York Times commits an honest error that it gets pointed to from those who want to treat the mainstream news media as fake news as see everything's the same. Like, like, like, like you're no better than than somebody who's just manufacturing fake news on a laptop in his basement.

Speaker 4:          02:16:18       Um, so it's, it's, and, and the flip side of that is when Alex Jones get something right, it seems to, it seems to make him look like a, a dignified journalistic enterprise analogous to the New York Times or to ABC News. And neither of those things are true. I mean, there are small lies and then they're a huge lives. There are honest mistakes, but be committed by totally reputable organizations that are really trying to get their facts straight. And then there are malicious that's just militia malicious propaganda outlets that are not at all trying to get their facts straight and trying to engineer everyone's credulity and ignorance into something that is just purely a matter of, of, uh, you know, tribal, a sentiment, you know. And um, so we lose our ability to distinguish these different projects when we say, oh look, you know, fake news. It both sides do it. Or here's a lie. Here's Susan Rice's one lie that she told in the last 10 years maybe in got caught for. And we have a president who lies every time he picks up his approaches a mike or, or picks up his twitter.

Speaker 2:          02:17:26       She had other problems because she had gone on, I believe, on the Sunday morning talk shows after Ben Gazi with some talking points. Yes. Yeah. No, soon as Susan look like she was itching to get caught. I mean, whether this was a case of. Yeah. Uh, no, I, I think your point is very, very important because I think that when you have, um, if you have one side that lies all the time, it's imperative that the other side don't lie at all. Yeah, yeah. Oh. And in the line and say, look, everybody does this. Why it's a tense time for people in my line of work because we were so much scrutiny and then we get it wrong. We really, you know, we take a lot of heat, but when we get it wrong, I think we're pretty quick to say we got it wrong. Here's the actual. Here's the truth. Do you know the Donald trump

Speaker 4:          02:18:15       junior said that cernovich get a pulitzer for exposing Susan Rice. Really? Yeah. Right. Yeah, it's a bit. But that's it. That's why this drives me a little crazy because it is not cernovich is the fact that, that this is

Speaker 2:          02:18:30       why did you lead them down the Cernovich that you just gave them right back into its yard in front of the kit. And we're only now discovering the consequences of this. Let's come back in five years, see if, if we're talking about anything that makes any sense. Well, it's all very blurry. It, it really is very blurred because we've never had a situation like this where we have a president that people just don't trust to be honest. And when someone would, if someone lied about anything in the past, I mean if Donald Trump got caught having his dick sucked in the White House to my on film and you know, he built like, look, I made a mistake when he wouldn't be, nothing would be nothing. Photoshop did that fake news. Just again, just slot to use Joseph Goldstein's phrase before about slotting into geological time and just looking at the broader scope of history, you know, we've had really, we've had periods of time where we had media than the muck rakers, you know, where the media outlets

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       were. Didn't even pretend at times to, to, um, to not have an agenda. Items where those. And the early parts of our republic where we had was a teddy Roosevelt called the journalists muck rakers where, um, they basically, he was saying that their job was to write muck, uh, to be working in filth and uh, the media and American politics have been filled with instances, American media and American politics had been filled with instances over our short history of a untruths and agendas. And, uh, then we have times of relative stability. And then sometimes we slide back into more tumultuous times. I think maybe the Pollyanna here, but I think that we, the republic will survive and that we will. It doesn't inexorably lead to a time where truth doesn't matter.

Speaker 2:          02:20:27       Well, it seems to open up the door for a viable alternative seems to open up the door for someone who comes along who is in many ways bulletproof. It is a very ethical. It's opened a door. I mean, now anyone talking to somebody to run for office. Yes. I, I just don't think anybody's bulletproof humans. Humans. I mean with the exception of Joe Rogan, but definitely not bulletproof. You don't have to be bulletproof. I mean, this guy has got nothing but bullet holes in him when he's president. What Joe was saying is it opens the door to somebody who's on a strong, viable alternative for someone who is ethical seminar. His door is open to anyone who, who couldn't be president at this point. I mean, there's no one that steps forward right now. I mean is, it doesn't. Do you think they're waiting? I mean like who? First of all it will say you couldn't be president. There was never. Has never been an atheist. They would attach your twitter page. First of all, good luck. They would hire him.

Speaker 4:          02:21:21       No, I mean I think, you know, if you're going to use a conventional political calculus, well then yeah. Then you know, an atheist be an atheist to having a history of psychedelic drug use, having edgy positions. That alienates, you know, massive a constituent constituencies I, but all of that. A deal breaker. But I could, you would never have predicted that someone this scandalous and inept and dishonest and provably so at every. I mean he can't. He literally can't get through an hour of the day without something that would have been a scandal in some previous age of the earth coming out of his, his mouth. Um, it's just, it's, I think, yeah, I think, I think there's no predicting who could be a president in the future mean it's, it's, it's you need a, you need wealth and you need charisma on some level. You need to, you need to be able to, to get a tribe behind you. Um, but I don't think you need any of what people thought you needed even a year ago. Well, what he's done by circumventing the whole system and bay being independently wealthy is really kinda. But even that was a jam. I mean that was amazing is that he is like, I don't know how much money he actually put into his campaign, but it's just not nearly what you would have. What you. I mean he really only had to pretend to be that wealthy and it was incredible. What happened.

Speaker 3:          02:22:48       Like is what he achieved with very little campaign funds and you know what I mean, you as a, he, it's like them or not, you have to give him credit for an unbelievable victory that very few people saw it coming. It's a popularity contest. Isn't that part of the problem as you made a popular person president of a popularity contest? I mean, that's what it is. He was, he was running against somebody who wasn't popular. So that's it. Let's put it in context. We're always coming after eight years of a Democratic president who was controversial in many ways. And it's always harder for somebody at the same party to run. So there are a lot of dynamics large or impersonal dynamics that were working in his favor. Yeah. It's just. But when we get back to the argument about like, are we in apocalyptic times or whatever, I guess, and I mean, I don't know anything, I, I, but my instinct is just as a country, we've, we've seen times have much worse division. We had a civil war. Um,

Speaker 4:          02:23:51       it's telling that you have to go back there for, for a compelling example,

Speaker 3:          02:23:57       this would've been the sixties. Yeah. People in the streets. We had the weather underground. We had to, you know, we was pretty to what we had. We had mlk and rfk assassinated right at time.

Speaker 4:          02:24:10       Yeah. What I'm worried about now is I think he's truly unique and I think, I think the, the way we're becoming unmoored from kind of the ordinary truth testing in politics I think is unique. I mean the fact that we have a president who seen it because there's a whole feedback mechanism and maybe trump seems to get some of his information from info wars and from places like info wars at all.

Speaker 3:          02:24:40       Yeah. I don't think he pays a price for, for his, his, his, his popularity rating is not high.

Speaker 4:          02:24:48       Oh yeah. Yeah. He's, he's paying some price. But the question is, is it going to be enough and what happens within the next terrorist attack? Right. I mean, so, so the real fear is that if we have a rush dog fire kind of moment, right, engineered by him or not. I mean, I'm not so paranoid as to think he's going to do it, but I just think it's inevitable. Something that's going to happen. I mean, we've, we've had a, we've had 80 days, 100 days, whatever it's been of his presidency were basically nothing has happened and it's been pure chaos, right? And the work of governments not getting done. The government's barely even staffed and this has been a period of work. Nothing really has happened, but imagine a nine slash 11 size event or something really goes off the rails with North Korea or China or Russia.

Speaker 4:          02:25:39       Uh, it will be so. I mean, the, the pressure when the pressure to normalize him as commander in chief will be much greater than it is now. And already everyone's feeling that pressure, um, but to the, the, the, the ability to clamp down on civil liberties and um, uh, just, uh, use the power of the presidency in a way that, that will be very difficult for, um, our society to recover from. I think it's just, I mean, I think the, it's, it's a scary moment and I'm, I mean, I, I the, the people who are drawn analogies between him and, you know, the thirties in, in, um, Germany. Um, I mean, I think those analogies are misleading in ways, but again, you just don't know how strange things could get in with a big negative stimulus to the system with what I think we know is that we have someone in charge who is a malignantly selfish conman.

Speaker 4:          02:26:52       Right? I think that is an objective fact. That's not a partisan thing to say he is. I mean, that's as obvious about him as his hair and to have that much power in the hands of somebody who is that, whose, whose ethical compass is that unreliable or reliably bad in my view? And I got, I wouldn't say this if pence who scares me for other reasons. I mean he's a theocrat. I wouldn't say this of, of most Republicans who I might disagree with, but there's just something. But to put that much power in the hands of somebody who, um, is so disconnected from facts and a and reasonable concern for the wellbeing of, of the rest of humanity and the future. And I mean it's just, it's, it's an incredible moment and I don't think we've ever had a president who you could look at and say that about. So clearly. I mean, not even Nixon, Nixon was pathological in other ways, but you know, Nixon Nixon was given us the clean air act, right. I mean, Nixon had some point of contact with terrestrial reality which wasn't just about figuring out how to, how to burnish his, his imaginary grander, you know. Um, so yeah, I mean, I, I mean, I think we're one huge news story away from finding out how bad a president he could be and think. I think that's.

Speaker 6:          02:28:23       No, I think

Speaker 3:          02:28:24       he could surprise that he could surprise even the people who are very pessimistic. Well, he could also rise to the occasion.

Speaker 4:          02:28:30       Yeah. Yeah, I see that. Well, no, I mean also like to know how I would be the first to give him or the system the credit for that. I mean it's like, it's like, it's not that I, I, if he starts doing something good like let's say a massive infrastructure project, right. That includes building out good things, not coal jobs, but you know, if you know, fixing bridge, clean infrastructure. Right, right. If he starts doing that, that, that I have no, I mean that's, that'd be fantastic. Right. And it's possible he could start doing that for his own. His motives wouldn't even matter ultimately as long as he was doing the right things. But his motives are so reliably,

Speaker 6:          02:29:15       uh,

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       self-involved that give me what we need is a system we need to. Someone needs to be able to play him. I mean, this kind of narcissistic Glockenspiel well enough to get him to do the things that would be good for the world, but I just don't see. I just, just, there's just too much chaos in the system for that to be a reliable. Well, like you, they, they try to keep him away from social media. Oh yeah, well that's working out. I mean, that's, that's a big thing, don't they? They try to pull him away from it. Yeah. But that's been impossible. No one can do it. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, remember that crazy press conference that he had like just a few weeks into being president. I was unbelievable. I had, I got text messages from friends that are Republicans and they're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          02:30:04       Yeah. But you know, there are, it's an interesting, um, it's an interesting sort of Roshak test because there are millions of Americans who watched that press conference and founded delightfully thought they thought that he was killed, but pounding on the, on the liberal media.

Speaker 4:          02:30:19       Yeah. When you read a transcript, when you read a transcript of what actually comes out of his mouth, it's, it is amazing. I mean it, the, the, the poverty of the passages in terms of information and I mean it's just the fact that we have a president who speaks like, this is cool. I could never have foreseen that in our lifetime this was going to happen. Just, it's unimaginable to me.

Speaker 3:          02:30:47       Yeah. I think a lot of people there are just indisputable, millions of elitist signed it, riff league concern to. Did you see bill Maher's

Speaker 4:          02:30:55       thing about Anthony Wiener that he thinks that Anthony Wiener should run against trump. We need our own crazy mad anthony wiener. Besides his obvious addictions to sexting with people was a very powerful politician and a very good speaker and he had a lot of very good quality. Who's going after bankers? The same as the Eliot Spitzer, Eliot Spitzer did a lot of good things. He was going after the bankers. He was going after corruption and yeah, well I've said it but that. That's an example. There's a flag planted that shows us how far we have gone from the normal. I mean Elliot Spitzer destroyed himself with one instance of hypocrisy. Right? Right. What was pretty bad? Trump level bad. I mean there's just no, we don't have. Well, they'll pop in the law in this way. I mean, he was. He was with a prostitute. Well, that's a stupid law.

Speaker 4:          02:31:52       The real problem was that he was going after going after Ross Johnson giant. That was the real problem is the hypocrisy. The hypocrisy wasn't that he did something illegal where you paid someone for sex, that that law seems to me to be so archaic and so ridiculous. You could pay someone to massage you, you can't pay someone to touch your genitals. It seems ridiculous. But I guess the other piece you have to put in play there is that there, there are some percentage of people working in the sex trade who are not doing it voluntarily or coerced to one another. And that's a horror show. And that's part of the problem with that is that it's illegal. I mean, that's the big argument is that, well, yes there is. There is that argument and I agree with you that, that it consenting adults should be able to do what they want to do, but the coop, but the crucial variable there is consent and.

Speaker 4:          02:32:45       Agreed. Agreed. Yes. Um, I just think that someone is going to have to be dynamic. They're gonna have to be, they're going to have to engage people in a way that they're going to have to deal with his attacks. It's case or maybe what's people will be thirsting for after after four years is a is actually blend. Yeah, right. Maybe right? Yeah. I would do with land right now. Fantastic blend at blanded. Actually super religious would be the might be happy for Ted Cruz and that blend. No, but my enthusiasm for impeachment suggests that I'm happy with pence. Right. Like so like if, if I could find the impeachment button, I would not hesitate to suppress it. And pence, given his religious commitments, you know, a few short years ago would've been among my worst nightmares. I mean I would be talking about the rise of the Christian.

Speaker 4:          02:33:41       Right. And the danger of theocracy and I mean his, but he's a psychologically he seems like a normal, predictable, solid American compared to what we have. Isn't the other question like trump's age, he's a 70 year old man. People don't really live that much past 70, especially people that are overweight and people that don't exercise all to healthy. And that campaign was, I can't believe. I mean that's his energy and his credit. Yeah, I mean that's an amazing thing to be able to do. How do you think it's most punishing thing in the world? I can't even imagine.

Speaker 3:          02:34:22       Schedule is always having a good time. Seriously did and in that press conference we're talking about [inaudible] 77, I think it was 77 minutes press conference. He looked like he was having a blast. Yeah, he gets like he gets really energized.

Speaker 4:          02:34:38       Yeah, I mean that's. It's got to be the most punishing, beat down ever if you're, if you're not designed for it. I mean I can't imagine how tiring.

Speaker 3:          02:34:47       I'd never done a campaign. I mean you get exhausted for 30 minutes of looking at your, at mentions

Speaker 4:          02:34:54       now you have to be wired differently, but you know, he clearly is, is he's wired that way. It's worked for them. But you need someone who's willing to submit to the punishment of running and that's a rare person or it's not. And the problem is that kind of selects or things that you don't actually want in a president or at least I wouldn't think you would want. I mean, it's Aleks for kind of narcissism and a sense that, that really has to be you, right? It doesn't, that doesn't select for the normal intellectual space. You, you're constantly aware, aware of the ways in which you are not the best guy or gal to be doing the thing, right? Like you want to defer to experts and, and um, you know, trump is only I can fix it, right? And that worked. And so you need something of that that creeps into the, um, the headspace of most politicians it seems. And, and, um, so scientific humility and I'm just a kind of a sense of the limits of, of any one person's expertise is not necessarily the right piece of software to have running at when it comes time to run for president.

Speaker 5:          02:36:12       Now I wanna switch gears a little bit. It's not, it's not totally related, but it is in somewhat in some ways, headspace. I'm talking about mindsets and talking about like we've brought this up but really haven't delved into it much at all about meditation and about how much it's affected you and how it got you back on track. And I know that you're a big proponent of it and I am as well, although I think I'd probably do it differently than you guys do, but I'd love to hear how you do it by using an isolation tank. Oh really? Like a sensory deprivation tank. Yeah. And I do a lot of yoga. Those are, those are two big ones for me. You know, I think those alone have straightened out my brain in a great way. Yoga in particular, Yoga, because it's, um, it's not yoga forces you to do it. You're either doing it or you're not doing it. There's no room for distraction. You know, you're, you're essentially forced to deal with what these poses require of you. And I think that in doing so and having a singular focus of trying to maintain your and stretch and extend and do all these different things while you do it, then concentrating almost entirely on your breath, which is a big factor in yoga that it has remarkable brain scrubbing attributes. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:37:28       I would say, and I don't know much before I say this, let me just ask, what are you doing in the isolation tank? Like what are you doing in your mind a lot? Well, you know, do you use it for

Speaker 5:          02:37:38       a bunch of different in a bunch of different ways. I don't use it as much as I should honestly. Um, but I concentrate on and sometimes I go in there with an idea, like I'll concentrate on material like that I'm working on or maybe Jujitsu techniques that I'm having problems with or some other things I'm dealing with, you know, any, any sort of issues that I have. Sometimes I do that sometimes it just go in there and chill out and relax and breathe and concentrate. There's a lot of physical things that happen inside the tank is the amount of magnesium in the water because it's epsom salts. It's really good for you physically. It's very good for the muscles. It loosens you up and relaxes you and that eliminates a lot of stress. And that physical elimination of stress allows the brain to function with just less pressure and allows you to relax more and put things in perspective better. And it also, it gives you this environment that's not available anywhere else in the planet. This weightless floating, disconnected from your body environment where you're. You don't hear anything, you don't see anything, you don't feel anything. You feel like you're weightless. You, you have this sensation of flying because you're totally weightless, weightless in the dark. You Open your eyes, you don't see anything, you close your eyes. It's exactly the same. The water's the same temperature as your skin so you don't feel the water and you floating.

Speaker 3:          02:38:55       I'll say this, I don't know how this is going to have to go down. I actually don't have any questions about the, the, the benefits of being in an isolation tank even though I don't know too much about it. And I also am a PR. I think yoga is great, although I don't do much of it myself. I, I think though that there may actually be a difference between those two activities and meditation because it a kind of highfalutin term metacognition, sort of knowing what you know or knowing that you're thinking that happens in the kind of mindfulness meditation of which, uh, Sam and I are proponents proponents that I think is a different thing where you're seeing. And I'll just try to put this in English. When you're meditating the way we do, you're seeing how crazy you are. You're sitting, you're fucking nuts, and that actually has a real value.

Speaker 3:          02:39:45       Is systematic collision with the asshole in your head has a real value because when the asshole offers you up a shitty suggestion in the rest of your life, which is basically it's job like, oh yeah, you should eat the 17th cookie or say the thing that's going to ruin the next 48 hours of your marriage or whatever. You're better able to resist it. So what, like what do you do? So I mean the basic steps of mindfulness meditation or to sit. Most people close their eyes. You bring your full attention, the feeling of your breath. Just the, you're not thinking about your breath, just feeling the raw data of the physical sensations, and then the third step is the Biggie, which is as soon as you try to do this, your mind's going to go bonkers. You're going to start thinking about what's for lunch to an eight, a haircut, where did your bills run wild, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          02:40:31       You're just going to notice, oh, I'm my mind's going crazy right now. But that noticing is the key moment is the fact that victory. It's interesting because this is when most people think they failed that because, oh, I can't meditate because I can't clear my mind. This is the, the biggest misconception about meditation. You do not need to clear your mind. That's impossible unless you're enlightened or dead. Uh, the whole goal is just to notice when you've become distracted and start again. You return your attention to your breath and you just do that a million times and every time you catch yourself wondering and go back to your breath, it's a bicep curl for your brain. It changes your brain and that over time creates the kind of Meta cognition I was discussing before where you see that you're a homo sapiens sapiens another word zero, a, that's how we're classified as a species, the one who thinks and knows he or she thinks and that just that knowing that you have this voice in your head, uh, as Sam likes to joke, he feels like when he thinks about the voice in his head, he feels like he's been hijacked by the most boring person alive.

Speaker 3:          02:41:36       Just says the same shit over and over. I'm a, a joke that I deal from them all the time. Yeah. Uh, that, that is enormously powerful because then you are not held hostage by this voice.

Speaker 2:          02:41:49       A similar thing happens in the tank. Um, I do a do a form of meditation, that tank. Sometimes when I go in there with or without an idea, like if I'm not working on material or anything else where I just concentrating on my breath in through the nose, out through the mouth, and I just literally concentrate on the breath. And the same thing happens to meditation. Meditation. It's similar, it's the exact same thing. The difference is in the tank. After Awhile, after about 20 minutes or so, that breaks loose to psychedelic states. Wow. Have you ever combined the tank with psychedelics? Altered state, so yeah. Yeah. Sweat trip. What? LSD or mushrooms? Mushrooms, but the big one is edible pot. Edible pod seems to be as strong as anything in there. Like I've got enough pot where I'm convinced I'm going to die, then I climb in there and every time I do it I go, don't do that again. So just get out. So terrified

Speaker 3:          02:42:41       your motivation when you're eating the pot and climbing into.

Speaker 2:          02:42:44       We'll see what happens. Okay. Yeah. Just be scared. Be terrified. Yeah. Because nothing ever happens. You never die, but God damn you just convinced that the universe is imploding around you and that it just. So it usually has the, the character of fear being part of it. It's also not embracing the fear, not letting the fear run rampant and just sort of relaxing and giving into the vulnerability, your, the finite of your existence

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       and just breathing and concentrating and letting. Letting the dance take place because there's some. There's some sort of a weird that one of the things that there's a big misconception about when it comes to edible pot, is it edible pod is like smoking pot. It's an entirely different process. Physiologically. Your liver time course is very different to it. We can stay stolen for three days. Yeah. You, you could fuck up and eat too many brownies and you'll be gone for a long time. That sounds miserable. It is, but it's not because he gets something out of it when it's over the. The process is excruciating, but when you come out of it, you just feel so happy. Feel so happy. It's over.

Speaker 3:          02:43:50       Is it like the joke about the dude is banging his head up against the wall and somebody says, why are you doing that? He says, because it feels so good when I stopped

Speaker 5:          02:43:58       in a way, but there's no physical damage banging your head up against the wall. You're going to hurt yourself. This is true.

Speaker 3:          02:44:03       Uh, yeah. I don't know. I think there seems like there might be easier ways to get to the same wisdom.

Speaker 5:          02:44:09       Maybe, but I think there's also creativity that gets inspired by the edible pot, something called 11 hydroxy metabolite that your body produces. It's so different than most people when they eat pot, they think they been dosed like anybody who smoked pot before and then you give them a Brownie. They think, oh my God, there something in that, and they're convinced because reality itself just seems like it just dissolves and especially inside the tank, there's something about the tank environment that produces. In the absence of any external stimuli, your brain becomes sort of supercharged because what you're trying to do when you're just sitting down and concentrating and relaxing as you're trying to focus on your thoughts, but you're still aware of your body. You're still aware of your elbows touching this desk, your butt touching the chair. There's all these different factors that are that are.

Speaker 5:          02:44:58       There's stimuli that's coming into your senses. Whereas in the tank there's none of that virtually. It's almost completely eliminated. There's some, but you can. You can. You could phase that stuff out, like you could still feel the water a little bit. If you think about it, you could still use, sometimes you bump into the wall and you have to like center yourself and you have to relax again and make sure you're not moving so you don't touch things which can kind of dissolve the experience, their experiences, meditation where you have that same experience where you lose your sense of the body, but that usually comes with more concentration. You have to be very concentrated on it. I feel like you would have that experience and it would be even more intense if you did the exact same thing that you do outside the tank in the tank.

Speaker 5:          02:45:44       I don't think you need any psychedelics and the tangle. It's one thing that I tell people when they ask me, should I get high before I do it? I'm like, no, just do it. Just do it. If you decide after a while, if you've done it three or four times, you was like, I wonder what it's like if I just take a little bit of a hit of pot and see where it takes me and there's nothing wrong with that. It's not going to hurt you, and if you're a type of person who enjoys marijuana or whatever, but the tank alone by itself, just the absence of sensory input,

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       your brain goes to a very, very different place and as long as you can relax and as long as you don't think too much about the fact that you're in the tank, just concentrate entirely on your thoughts entirely on your breath. And again, let all those crazy like where to hamsters live like all that shit. Let let all that stuff run wild through your mouth, but I feel like in the tank at least that gets to a certain spot. Then it stops existing and then the psychedelic state takes over. Yeah, well it depends on what the goal is. I think there can be many different goals of meditation or quasi spiritual practice and they're not there. They're distinct. So the center of the Bullseye for me is not suffering unnecessarily. Right? So. And so one thing that, that mindfulness gives you is so it's potentially, it's compatible with every experience you can have.

Speaker 4:          02:47:07       I mean, there's is nothing in your experience that isn't inappropriate object of meditation. You just, most people start with the breath because it's just a very convenient thing to start with, but once you know how to do this particular practice, you're just, your goal is to just be clearly aware of whatever your experience is in each moment. So it's emotions arise, thoughts arise, sounds come in your, your attention is wide open to whatever your experience is. So it's not like. So. Nothing in principle is a distraction. I mean that could be, you can be meditating right next to a construction site and the sound of the hammers is just as good and object of meditation as the breath or anything else. So there's nothing. Everything is included, but the, the, the superpower you're after, which you actually can acquire through this practice is to realize that virtually all of your, of your psychological suffering and actually arguably, virtually all of your, your physical suffering or the difference between physical pain and suffering, which I mean, those two are not quite the same thing.

Speaker 4:          02:48:17       Um, is a matter of being lost in thought as a matter of thinking, without knowing that you're thinking and what and what mindfulness does. And really any technique of meditation ultimately should do, is teach you to break the spell of being lost in thought and to notice a thought as a thought. I mean the, the, the huge difference is until you learn how to meditate or do something like meditation, you're just helplessly thinking every moment of your life, you're having a conversation with yourself. You're having content, whether it's images, stick or linguistic, poor forth into consciousness, every moment and so incessantly that you don't even notice it. It's just white noise. And not only does it completely color your experience moment to moment. So like if you're, if they're angry thoughts, you're angry. If they're depressed thoughts or you're depressed or sad that you're sad.

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       So you become your thoughts, but you also feel, you feel, you feel identified, you feel that you are the thinker of your thoughts. You feel like a self and it's completely structured by this flow of, of mentation every moment and it produces everything you do. It produces all of your intentions and your goals and your actions, and he said this about me and now I'm going to say that. I mean, so it's like it's everything coming out of you is born of of this same process and meditation is a way of recognizing that consciousness and then what you are subjectively as a prior condition of just be awareness in which everything is showing up, sounds, sensations and thoughts and thoughts can become just other objects of consciousness and I'm so I'm going to take eva, Eva, at a very basic example of the difference between between pain and suffering.

Speaker 4:          02:50:04       You can feel very strong physical pain, I mean unpleasant pain and just be aware of it in that sense that it's unbearable is virtually always untrue because you in that moment, you've already born it, right? That may, that the feeling that something's unbearable is really the fear of having to experience it in the next moment in the future. Right? Because you're almost like if some. If someone drives a nail into your knee, right? You might only. That's a. That sounds like it's unbearable, but every moment you're feeling it, you're burying it, right? It's like, it's, it's what you're, what you're thinking about is the last moment and the next moment. Then you're thinking about how much you know, when am I going to get some relief and you know, what's the cure and how badly is my knee injured? And you know, like you're, you're, you're, you're worried about the future continuously and you're not noticing the automaticity of thought that is, that is amplifying the, the, the, the negative negativity of the experience in that moment.

Speaker 4:          02:51:04       And we all know that you can have super intense sensation which is either either pleasant or unpleasant depending on the, on the conceptual frame you've put around it. So for instance, if, if you had this massive sense of soreness in your shoulder that you would experience it very differently if it was a, the result of you dead lifting more than you ever had in your life and you were proud of it, right? Be probably cancer. And you're waiting for your, you know, the, the biopsy results. And, and, and, uh, you know, you're worried about this is the thing, the thing is going to kill you or you're getting raw for some deep tissue massage and it hurts like hell, but you actually totally understand the source of the pain and you know, it's going to be gone the moment the guy pulls his elbow back, right? So it could be the exact same sensation each one of those, but the conceptual frame you have around it totally dictates the level of psychological suffering and, or the or

Speaker 2:          02:52:05       the can dictate the total absence of psychological suffering. Now we were talking before the podcast started about your apps and we were talking about the amount of different meditation exercises on the APP. So like what kind of different meditation exercises are there? If you're talking about just concentrating on mindfulness and breathing,

Speaker 3:          02:52:26       uh, as it turns out, you can iterate off of that basic exercise a in some to, to like a infinity essentially because you talk about not only will I lose my, I don't want to get too ahead of myself, but basically the, the, the basic instructions are that we listed before. You're feeling your breath coming in and then when you get lost, you start again, but then you can add onto that. So one big thing to add on is something called mental noting, so you're breathing in and out, you're feeling your breath, and then you get distracted by a huge wave of anger. Generally speaking, when we get hit by a wave of anger, we just inhabit the anger. We become angry. There's no buffer between the stimulus and our response to it, but there's this little technique you can do of just making a little mental note of, Oh, that's anger.

Speaker 3:          02:53:18       And that kind of objectifies the thing. It's a little bit like pressing the picture and picture button on your remote control where the story that's taken up, the whole frame can be seen with some, uh, perspective. Uh, so that's just one example of the little techniques that you can add onto the basic exercise. And you can go for a long time. So as we were discussing Sam's about to start his meditation APP, which is going to be called what sent waking up, waking up. And I have mine, which is called 10 percent happier. Sam is going to be doing all the teaching on his APP and my, on my absence. I'm not a teacher. We have experts coming in like Joseph Goldstein, who's again the friend of a friend of both Sam and I, um, a and you, each teacher has their own emphasis and you then start talking about applied meditation.

Speaker 3:          02:54:07       So how do I use it when we're, how do I use in my everyday life? How do I use it if really what I want to do right now is, um, control my eating. So meditation, for example, we have a course on the APP that talks about using it to not overeat. By the way, I'm terrible at this, but you can use your ability, your mindfulness, your ability to know what's happening in your head in any given moment without getting carried away by it to not overeat. Notice, Oh, I'm having this urge right now to eat as I did last night in entire bag of melted chocolate in my hotel room. Uh, but I don't, I can ride that urge and not do the thing that I know is stupid. Um, so anyway, that's just a little taste of how you can take meditation and bring it in numerous directions. Do

Speaker 2:          02:54:54       you guys feel competitive? Both of apps now isn't even out yet? No, not yet. When he comes out and completely cannibalize cannibalizes

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       men both then yeah. How happy is for me 10 percent happier. I'll be like negative 100 percent. What's 10 percent of zero? Yeah, exactly. No, I actually think I'm of the view, you know, now that I've been in this meditation APP business for a little while, I'm kind of, I don't think it's Uber, I don't think the business model is that there's just one huge app that everybody uses and maybe there's some distant, you know, second, I actually think it's more, a little bit more like fast food. I think it's going to be a bunch of big players and uh, in, you may switch back and forth. Um, and so I think it's just one need a nap. No, no, no you don't.

Speaker 4:          02:55:42       But I mean, the thing that's useful and it's really useful at any level of expertise in, in meditation and that at least this kind of meditation is having someone guide you. Yeah, it's, it's like a a mindfulness alarm that's constantly going off, going off and you know, periodically over the course of 10 minutes or 20 minutes or however long you're sitting and because distraction is just continually the problem and you're either meditating or you're distracted. You're either, you're either aware of what's happening at that moment or you're lost in thought. And that's true throughout your life. I mean, you're either hearing what I'm saying right now, or you're thinking about something else and you don't know it, right? Or you're. You're either reading the book you're intending to read or your mind is wandering. You're going to have to read that paragraph again. So this, this failure to concentrate, this failure to be able to focus on what you're intending to focus on.

Speaker 4:          02:56:35       Is it just this, this universal problem of human consciousness. And so meditation trains that and other benefits follow, but the having a voice in your head reminding you that you're even attempting to be meditating is a very powerful, even if you're, even if it's your own voice. I mean, even when I'm listening to a meditation that I recorded, just my own voice, remember it reminded me that I'm, that I'm supposed to be meditating. It works like any other voice, you know, and it's um, so it's, it's just, it's a feedback system that you can't really provide for yourself, although you, obviously you can, I mean, you can meditate without an app and most people do. I mean, I've spent very little time meditating with apps. I just think they're very useful.

Speaker 3:          02:57:30       But you see, both of us started meditating. I started meditating well before I did, but we both started pre worn around. Um, uh, so the, you can read, you can read a book, read a good book and learn how to meditate out of the book and just basically remember the basic instructions and do it. Uh, but a really is useful to have an APP, especially for some people because one of the biggest problems in meditation is this persistent fear that you're not doing it right. And so to have a voice you in your ear just giving you, reminding you of the basic instructions which are so simple but very easy to forget. It can be very useful.

Speaker 2:          02:58:10       I like the idea of it being like bicep curls for your mind. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:58:16       I mean, you see, you see it in the brain scans and no Samuel correct me where I run a foul of scientific accuracy here, but this base, this, this simple act of sitting, trying, trying to focus on one thing at a time. And then when you get distracted knowing you're distracted and returning to your breath is changing your brain. When you do that, you're boosting a, the muscles. Uh, the obviously the muscles. I'm using a, a light loosely. You're boosting your focus muscle and in many cases, whether there was a study in 2010, I think it was done at Harvard, uh, that took, people would never meditated before and they scanned their brains and then they had them do eight weeks of a, I think, a half hour a day of meditation. The end of the eight weeks they scanned their brains again. What they found was in the area of the brain associated with self awareness, the gray matter group, and in the area of the brain associated with stress, the gray matter shrink. That to me is pretty compelling.

Speaker 2:          02:59:16       That is beautiful. Gentlemen. We just did three hours. Wow. Wow. Flew by. Yes, it did. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you. My pleasure. All right, everybody. That's it. Go do something else. No.
