Speaker 1:          00:00:02       It's like old school, Russian

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       three to do something I like about the fact that you could smoke in here. I liked the people can be relaxed. I had to find a comedy club to shoot our special word that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:18       Where'd you go? Comedy cellar. The underground. The underground. They let you smoke. Well, but I left. It was just like a rule where if you're a performer you can get away with because it's a part of your routine that you get like a cabaret old still on the books. To don't take my word for that. I believe I learned that from dice while he was onstage. Yeah, I think you read that in the dice. Chappelle manual. Yeah. Well they can get away with it, right? Yeah. Dave's always smoking on stage. No, I don't. I don't smoke anymore. But I'll tell you one thing that that year in between like, well, you're not allowed to smoke on stage. That was a tough year because he used to like smoking in the crowd smoke and you know, it was kind of a fun thing. A punchline enhancer to Dave. You do smoke on stage. Not all the time, like towards the end of it, maybe not only that, but when we were on the road and we'd do like an hour and a half, he'll pretend he's getting a phone call or something. Go smoke. Lead me on stage by myself. Really? Yeah, but it gives you a chance to like open up a long form bit. Now you're hearing it, Joe. Now you're really hearing the whole story behind the bumping mic. When you behind the bumping Mike, what do you get out of here?

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       Smoking onstage. It just fulfills the nicotine fix. Or does it actually give you something? Because they say, I've smoked a cigarette. I smoked one at Tony Hinchcliffe cigarettes a couple of times before I went onstage and you get like a pick me up. There's a little something. You get an enhancement.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       All right, Jay. I, I'll say it right now. It definitely is a weakness that like, you know, now I don't drink, don't do anything but like coffee and cigarettes. It's like it's breathing for me, but a onstage. It does focus. It helps focus you. They

Speaker 2:          00:01:56       said it's legitimately, they say new nicotine is actually a good nootropic yeah. It actually enhances cognitive function. Like if you do a test without nicotine, then do a test with nicotine nonusers. Yeah, it makes me nauseous if I accidentally smoke a blunt and not just straight weed or tobacco. Like snoop handed me something the other day and I thought it was all pop, but there was tobacco and those things are the shit. There's a back and deal with it on the paper champion. Once you get these, where were they at this company? Hollywood's for. I don't know the stores these days. These are my favorite. I'll check them out. It's a Charlie Murphy got me into these things back in the day because he would roll them himself. He would get those swisher sweets and he would tear them apart and then he put the weed inside of it and roll it out. Oh yeah. Old School and then a Chappelle got me into it again because I smoked one with him one day at the back of the comedy store. I was like, damn, this is a weird high. What is the like you get a buzz, it's like you're a little high, but you're also

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       a little bit buzzy from love from the tobacco. Well, I want to get my fan, whatever it takes to make the jokes fly, bro. Whatever they were. When they made your jacket, they will smoke a cigarette and I'll take like one hit of weed right before we go on and we meet in the middle. One hits good one hip before you've gone too much before? No, no, not in a long, long, long, long time. You feel like I'd like one more, but Ooh, that's a dangerous dangerous decision. Yeah. You want to stay a little quick coffee though? I need coffee before red bull will make me too like jumpy and nervous, but coffee will get my brain work and just a little bit quicker than the audiences. Did you guys do this one time as a goof and then start touring with it? Or did you just put the idea together? Like what? What made you decide to work together like this?

Speaker 4:          00:03:54       You know, it all started out just late night at the comedy cellar where, you know, I'd be on stage and I would just see jeff in the room and I would bring them up and then we would just, you know, like throw down basically and have a great time. And we kept doing it and doing it and people actually, you know, like they wanted to see it. It became like this Kinda like, are you guys going to go up together? They would always ask us, how are you guys going up together? We would get the next mic go,

Speaker 3:          00:04:16       you know, that kind of thing. How it really when I was living in la or not even when I started, but in the last few years I'd come back to New York. I have an apartment in Greenwich village near the comedy cellar and you know, it's like cheers. I mean with knows your name, you, you land, you go sort of go into my empty apartment. I'll go, let's see who's at the seller and get something to eat. And I started booking my flights where I land around midnight day. When would inevitably have the 1:00 AM spot and I would, I just wanted to get my yas out and he would just bring me up and he'd sit by the piano and I would goof off or I'd sit by the piano and he would tell jokes when we started setting each other up and it organically, our friends started popping up with us or people from the audience or whatever, Bachelorette party and we just started making an act out of it without even realizing it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:03       Yeah. Wow. It was like a, it was a lot of fun like in the beginning especially because it was like, you know, he really kept me on my toes. Like listening is like the hardest thing listening on stage, you know, because once you're up there alone, locked in, you know, like you control all, like facets of, of the performance. But when there's another president up there, especially jeff and I, we have so many different skill sets. So like it was really cool to work off of him. A brought up my game a bit. It definitely made me quicker and faster and funnier to have to like, you know, really pretty much roll with it, you know, and I, I think that the crowd dug that too. It was like a different energy than just straight up like a showcase, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:05:43       the one thing that you would do on a podcast so you wouldn't normally do on stage which is look at someone else and it took me a long time and I think I could

Speaker 4:          00:05:52       a million arguments on looking at each other like sports. If you look at you're

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       never going to not catch that ball, but when you're wondering what the other guy's doing and you're kind of going like this, but when I, it's like w we connect now and instead of doing like in tandem one at a time jokes, we do jokes together.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       That's how like that's a weird thing. We're twins, we're twins will do an act and one guy will do the setup and the other guys and then they do a double punch line to gather. We're hoping for that one day to coordinated.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       I feel like it's one plus one equals three. You know, two headliners get together by choice, not by necessity, but then, and then Dave, you know, I, I, it took a lot. Dave did not want to go to Montreal. We went up to the comedy festival and I basically begged him. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       do it together. Yeah. I just, I saw it mostly it's just like a fun thing to do. Seller.

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       Yeah. Like it was just like a cool, like, you know, basically like just let it all hang out. But Jeff saw like I guess the next step to it. So

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       I always just thought it was something that if the comics wanted to see it that bad and then more and more comics corner to come on stage with us and then more and more like Jim Carrey came to one of our big shows in Montreal and, and, and, and, and all the headlines are sort of popping up with us and I thought Oh, this is more than just us as a hobby. Like this is something that no one else is really doing. Yeah. I got really into it really quick and I tried to call it clumping mix and Dave was like, no,

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       it's like it's too on the nose. That's good for a title. We don't have any other structure to our show. By the way. We don't rehearse. He has a flip phone. I can't even talk to him before the show. We don't have any plan. What's stressful job? Why do you have a flip phone? Why? I'm trying to stay off the grid. Dude, you saw me with a sword in front of the flag. I'm ready to go. I'm ready. I'm ready to be activated. No, I'll tell you. This is the best

Speaker 4:          00:07:52       title for it. Jeff is really a good producer and all those different things. All the same skillsets. I don't have like he's produced producer. He know show busy, all those different things. But like I was like we should have like really like workshops. Some other names like, like to Castello's looking for an Abbott Nichols

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       and May I

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       teams out there. I'm not going to say there aren't, but the thing is that like we're not really a team, like we both have our separate stuff, but when we get together it's like this kind of like almost like, um, you know, like within 48 hours we're a team again, you know, it's only really difficult, but I think we rock out in certain situations. Like I want to go through it with you because you've done every venue now you've an outdoor, you've done theater, you've done casino. I think we are one of the best casino acts I'll say. Right. I think we really are. I think at a casino we take it to the level that needs to be. Especially in a d level casino. I'm talking like, like you're like hoping. Yeah, yeah, exactly. They're hoping for like a, you know, like one of those electric poker thing like

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       that kind of the woods yet. Well Fox would we do rock the casinos because I guess they let them smoke my people. That's true about casinos, but it's also a very body audience and you can say anything. You don't have to hold back at all and you know, we just fearless. Um, I have a filter up, but he is fearless. He really has actually been changed. Is that place in Temecula, right? That place is actually nice. What am I thinking of? I'm thinking of what's the plan? What's the fucking place on the five playboy one marina. You sell the hustler because that would be great if we just do one like that. Planned Pa. That's our best one too. I love that one. The other one, it's an old steel mill, but now it's a casino in deadline. The, I think it is Bethlehem. We always have our best shows.

Speaker 1:          00:09:44       They're so excited. Man. First roadshow. Very. Yeah. Those weird road gigs and the one we were going to cancel it, but we never canceled and like Utah or something. Uh, we did the Oklahoma, right? One. Oklahoma. Yeah. You guys did in Oklahoma run. Well he did. I did a one casino that I drove through like this crazy storms in the next one. Oklahoma. Man, you can drive as fast as you want. Fuck. They don't care. Montana hidden even have dry. They didn't have no speed limits. Isn't that cool? They just had to impose speed limits within the last decade or two because of the federal government. They said, look, we're not going to fix your fucking Rhodes to tell people that can't go 150 miles an hour. I love it. That's a Montana though, you know, burst says that Oklahoma's fucking amazing. It was fantastic. Yeah. I want to play there for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       But I was playing the casinos and then I met Jeff at this one. That's like right on the border of Texas and uh, you know, Seinfeld plays there fact Kerrville. Yeah. Seinfeld plays there. Kerrville. Townson. Yeah. And it was like a rough roughly Toquerville yeah. But he's got it down to a science man, you know, fly in, fly out, that kind of thing. You know, we're in bed, we're in bed at night, I guess if you have a nice life in a nice house. But I like going and looking around the local places and eating the local fair. I still kind of love that. Well, he's in that weird place to where I don't think he can go places. Yeah, that's true. We can't rely on the street. You're like, Holy Shit. It's held. It's gotta be weird, Joe. That's what we do at this show because we're both a little older now.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       We, we really eat. That's what we do. We really enjoy it. What's your like? Do you like steaks and stuff? Oh Dude, you should hang with us because we eat cow steaks. He likes to eat like steak and shit. Like game of thrones giving kids their breakfast. Kids eat elk. They really do well. Well it's delicious. I wish I, I need to set up a kitchen here and cook for you guys. Oh, that will be great. Fucking fantastic. Kids eat for breakfast. If you ate it, you'd want to get it more. Really. What does it taste like? Meat scale. Like a bison like him a little bit

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       more. Uh, unusual. Better than venison. Deer. Venison slowly on a pellet grill. And then I sear it on the outside of the end. Oh yeah. So your thanksgiving Mr. out of control. Well, this year. No, I'm just here. We just did the normal Turkey thing, Turkey in a deep. Uh, but he caught it with his own hands. That's true. Roof of the studio. We did the peanut oil thing. We deep fried peanut law makes it better. Yeah. But it's like it's a scam. How do all this stuff? He's like, every time I meet you have like two other skills, like how do you do this stuff? You're pretty busy. I need things to occupy my brain. I just have one of those brains. The only way I'm at peace as if I have a bunch of difficult shit that I do all the time and constantly challenging themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       I have to. That's how my brain works. You know, everybody has their own weird kink. Kink is I need to be exhausted just for your brain itself. It needs to be fed. My brain's needs. Shit. Do it needs things to concentrate on. If I, if I don't have things to concentrate on, the things that are really difficult. I uh, I started playing tricks on myself. I mean, mental or physical? Both. Both. Mental and physical. Yeah. I'd have to have both. How do you handle the time management with family and career and get up early. Get up early this morning I was up at 6:30 kids. Go to school there. They're leaving the house by seven. Take the dog running. I'm gone for two hours. Then I come back, get a bunch of shit done at the house then come over here. Then you know, hang out with you guys for a few hours.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Then I'm going to lift and then I'm going to go to the store and uh, do couple sets. I have a good time doing like a 16 hour day there. Right? Well yeah, but the thing is like the way it works really good with me with families that most of the stuff I'm doing either while my kids are at school or while my kids were asleep. So by the time I leave I have a 10:00 spot at the store. Dirty asleep. They'd go to bed at like 8:30. How old are they now? The youngest ones are eight and 10. Oh, okay. Yeah. So it's, it's a, they'd go to bed, get up at like 6:30, they go to bed at like 8:30. So that's perfect time for me. Then you got your own. When's the last time you just quit? Something in the middle was like fuck it, I can't figure this out.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       Like what? A bit of a team. Sometimes bits. You just got abandoned them and come back to them and a couple of weeks or a couple months or a couple of years sometimes. Yeah. Everybody has that one like great beginning of a bit. And they're like, where does this go? And then you just keep throwing it out, thrown it out, thrown it out. That's the cool thing with jeff is that like, um, you know, we both bring material up on stage, but at the end of the day it's the stuff that just comes to us like that, you know, in the moment stuff, especially with the audience. That's the stuff that I really think, uh, you know, we should give a shout out to Andrew, the director of core capturing all that Jeff's friend who is now a one of the best directors out there. Man, he really, uh, he really, you know, once again it was jeff's choice and he did the job and then some. I mean, it's so good the

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       way he put it all together, you know, when you guys have,

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       it's more than just you guys going onstage. There's a bunch of other stuff happening. There's a bunch of people are dropped by three, three episode series. Oh, really? Docu series. So I don't know if you saw the jinx on Hbo about Robert Durst electrode wires, that phenomenal documentary. I heard my buddy Andrew directly directed that he also directed capturing the Freeman's years ago was an Oscar nominated documentary. What was that about? That was about a family of convicted, actually child molester math science teachers in Long Island. Oh, father son member. The based on a short that he did about a party clown who's family wound up being implicated in this crazy controversy. Oh, that's right, that's right. Oh, that was him, Huh? Yeah. Wow. Andrew and I are tight and Dave and I were sort of going back and forth on who could sort of direct us who had no our moves but yet had the experience and doesn't like anybody that's too hip.

Speaker 4:          00:15:52       I just want, I want, I like it straight ahead of Andrew. I liked it straight ahead and I, and I also think some of these comedy specials or over directed, so I didn't want to fall into this whole like, you know, instead of like lighting the stage, you guys hold lanterns, that kind of thing. Know bumped lanterns and then we'll have, you know, like that kind of thing. Like, you know, that'll be the essence of the humor that could happen to. Exactly. So. But he really, he really was cool and he really was patient and he really brought a lot of things outside of my wheelhouse. You know, it's a collaboration, which is another thing you're not used to doing when you do your own special, like, you know, you're like, Hey, I want to do it this way. I've been doing it this way and I want it that way, but we have other voices in the room and uh, you know, other ideas. Then, you know, you've got to like pretty much mesh together into something that, you know, pretty much I guess captured the spirit of it and also like hopefully the funding of it, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:16:44       well, if you've got that guy as your director mean, that's fucking incredible. It looks cool. And he also understood our personalities and our friendship. You know, I've been chasing Dave my whole career. I always just an open mic or I would go watch dave or, you know, I always thought like, if no one's gonna make it in our crew until Dave makes it. Dave was always the one that everybody, even when Ray Romano was popping on TV, he would call it down to watch Dave attell, you know, riff and you know, my first tv spot was a seven hour train ride with Dave to Canada. You know, when we were really young and I've heard three versions of the story. Joe, what's the first version?

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       No, it's like, it's like Canada or Syracuse.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       No, it was candidate, it was, it was a Hamilton, Canada, whatever. We took a train from the. Anyway, I'm just saying Hamilton. It's called. Isn't that an Ontario? I guess so, but uh, I'm just saying I've been. Dave. Dave is my favorite comic.

Speaker 4:          00:17:44       I didn't know that until we really started working together. I consider it consider contemporary weird you out and he's like, you're his favorite comic. I'm a little bit and know, be honest. Yeah. But no, I, I see, I see jeff is like beyond unique, like there's nobody like him and what he does and what he is able to do is really, it's really, it's not only fun to watch but it's really like, you know, you're a self starter. He's a self starter. Like it's great to see self starters who find success because it really is difficult to like take something and like make it not only financially successful but also like something that, that we all respect and love, you know. And that's, you know, I'd say the roasting thing that Jeff really pretty much has rebranded into, like, you know, every, every, every possible way you can do it is always good because he's behind it, you know, when it's not, when it's not really with him, then you're like, I'm not so sure. There's other people who are really good at it too. But I'm just saying that like, you know, that is when we're on the road and people will scream out the car door. It's the roast master. I mean like, you know, I had my insomniac time, but he like 20, 30 times that in terms of like, recognition. I mean it's just amazing. It is.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       We're the year. You're synonymous with roasts. Yeah. You know, people say roast, they think Jeff Ross, I earned it because when people laughed at me and thought, oh, that's a dead art. It's a lost art. It's antiquated. It's Corny. It's old guys. I stuck by it and said, no, it's alternative comedy. No one's doing it. I get to, I get to hang with legends like Buddy Hackett and Milton Berle, you know, and I stuck to it because it was a lot. There was a, there was a time where I was like embarrassed, like, oh, I'm going to be pigeonholed as the roast guy. Were you embarrassed? Not In my, I don't know if embarrassed is the right word, but uncomfortable. Yeah, because you're like, well, I want to be more than that. When was this around? This was probably 10 years ago, and I was in Vegas, Chappelle, again, words of wisdom.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       He's like, dude, that's your lane. Make that a five lane highway and ride it. And that's kind of what we started when I started doing sort of really owning it and loving it and to the credit of the world as we became more pussies in the world. Like roasting became more and more potent and important. Yeah. And the world needs to develop thick skin and I think roasting honors people and it's done with love, but it also kind of toughens us up a little bit. Well, I think it's of the time when I came back to the comedy store, first thing I came back to watch was roast battle. Yeah. And uh, I hadn't really known I'd heard, but I didn't really know where it was. And I remember that night. I remember that night really well because I remember thinking, Holy Shit, this is so mean.

Speaker 4:          00:20:30       It is. Sometimes I'll be like woke, you guys go deep,

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       but really good. We were at the other club, the Improv. Sure. Thanks. That's a great tobacco though. I'll take a, I'll take a real leaf. The leaf, I can deal with it, deal with it. Doesn't have any inside. Is My company going crumble because of this. I'm not going to get audited by NASA. Pumped him up. He went down with, he went back up, Tesla went down and then it went out. Really went down six percent. Then it went up. Nine studios still smells a little Muskie, but that night when I walked in there, I remember thinking, this is a joke writing thing. This isn't just a simple as um, the art of the insult. Yeah, it's, but it's, it's, it's a joke writing and one of the things I love about roast battle is how Moses makes everybody hug at the end of it. It's very cool sort of judging it and people were pushing each other and screaming at each other.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       And I wrote the rules of roast battle, original material only. Um, no physical contact. Yeah, that's scary. And every battle went to the hug. I've seen that with them. Rap battles guys punch each other in the face. Rap battles also like the way more mean version of roast battle. Those fucking guys I've seen some just horrible, horrible shit. People say to each other and Moses like he owns that, that, that, that circus. You've got to admire the fact that he can week after week make that work. One of the reasons why it works, he's so likable. Like Brian is such a nice guy. He's such a, he's such a good, good hearted, sweet person. We were at the Improv that night. You hadn't been at the comedy store and years and years and years and years and I don't know all the details and it never really was part of part of my and you were asking me about Roche Pat or somebody started asking me about it in front of you and I saw you getting curious and you get more curious and you were maybe a little homesick for the comedy store.

Speaker 3:          00:22:27       Who knows? And I said, come on, let's go jump in my car and you're like, I'll meet you there. And you sat up on the balcony where the judges sit and you hadn't been in the belly room in five years maybe. Who knows? Seven, seven years and you're sitting there and Moses does a double take and he's too afraid. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't really know you. You haven't been back there, you haven't been in the store. And finally I say comedy store legend back after a long time, say hi to Joe wrote real low key intro and I've been in that room a lot for roast battle. I'd never heard anything like place reverberated like I thought we were going to fall into the main room and it was it. That was it you even back everyday since I had to go back to.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       Because Ari was filming his comedy central specials tonight. It's one of the reasons why I had to go to Rosebud and I loved him. I really love them. There's no way I was going to miss a special. I was like a half to go there. I don't want to go there the night of his special. Let me just go there a day early. So I went there a day early and you, uh, you end up judging roast battle on comedy central and Dylan. Oh, you're part of our, your, your royalty over there. Earl Skakel came out shirtless with a gold chain with a code on this day. That was one of the greatest entrances I've ever anybody take

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       onstage and he fucking murdered. He was on fire on fire.

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       It's like the art of the insult. You might not be the strongest headlining act, but if you can put five jokes together, you can take somebody down.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       But here's the question, why is it that so many people excel at that, like, especially young comics, but they can't seem to figure out a way to generate that kind of energy during a regular set

Speaker 4:          00:24:12       different? I think they don't get stage time. I think that's really what it is. There's a lot of that for sure that this is their moment. So they throw all in. But can I say as an outsider since I never was really a west coast, you know, comic like you guys, uh, is that the comedy store from back in the day to before the roast battling to, to the roast Batak like an amazing difference. I remember walking in there and it was like, it was like a haunted house, you know, you're like, where is everybody? What's going on? Sam Kennison played here, you know, and then like, you know, you go onstage and it was like, you know, 12 tourists in the room and then a bunch of comics in the back. And then after the rose petal, I like the energy. You could just see it just went out like through the roof of just like it was the place to hang and like it became like when you're in town you want to go by the store and just check it out and like go on stage and you know, the crowds there became way better and I think that you were part of that have really helped reenergizing that club

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       hundred percent. That's what I felt when I went back, I was like, this is a different place.

Speaker 3:          00:25:09       Even Lil rel howery said there's no other comedy competition where other comics come to watch true 100 percent cheer on their friends or kind of roll their eyes at the ones that they don't want to win and there's a fraternity there. I feel like comedians and I feel like we're a cult in a weird way sometimes I feel like I'm a comedian before I'm even an American, like comedians from all over the world and I feel like I know them my whole life and roast battle is now international. Yeah, so that's a great story. It really is a movement like that where it was sort of a corny thing that nobody really understood the roasting. I couldn't even try out roast jokes when I first started. It was like so mean. If I would stand there with a piece of paper and read 10 William Shatner jokes people.

Speaker 2:          00:25:56       You were doing that one night at the Improv. I'm trying to remember who you were practicing for. People have the same people that would be at the roast. It'd be dying. It's hard to put yourself in that roast mindset. Like when you go to see the gross mindset, it's like going to see a fight. Say if you went to see a fight and you knew you're going to go see a fight, you can handle the fact that the fight was going on, but if you just show up at the movies to people, start head start. We can agree to to horrific shit. If we just know it's going to take place in advance

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       as part of that and it, and it is a sport. Roasting has 100 percent of a sport.

Speaker 2:          00:26:40       It's definitely a game because there's strategy. It's not just

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       jokes, it's like you're trying to disarm someone's material towards you. Maybe like sometimes guys will go at themselves first and then go out the their opponent like in the same joke, but they go, they're already sort of there. It's very smart. People are being clever with because they've been doing it for a few years now, so they've seen people bomb, they've seen people murder

Speaker 4:          00:27:06       other strategies like any other sports and you punch back and you have your, you have your a retort ready and you know there's all kinds of other little things like, you know, maybe don't mention the obvious thing till the end and then you're going to. Sure, yeah, yeah. I don't want to give too many secrets away, but better roast battle battlers. We'll study the game tape if you will, and figure all this stuff out. And you know, five jokes. I mean it's not easy. No, it's not easy. If you trip or stumble, can you recover?

Speaker 5:          00:27:39       Tony Hinchcliffe that goddamn assassin. If that shit, that motherfucker. He's an assassin at roasts. He's got an evil little black spot in his heart and he likes to open up whenever those roasts come at. Those jokes are vicious and clean, tight.

Speaker 4:          00:27:57       But I, I've generationally, it doesn't, it's not unfortunately do off the top of our head. I mean if you can do that also, but tony takes it seriously and it's like, like I say, the, it's an art. Yes. That's also the skill of joke writing, which is like in today's world of more storytelling and all that kind of stuff that it's, it's, it's few and far between where you actually see like someone who can put together a couple of jokes in a row and you're like, wow, that was a great run. You know, like everybody has one good joke and then like, you know, maybe a couple of tags but like to actually have a great run. You know, that's the thing that always excites me about comedy and when he'll tell you like when work together, he'll go what new stuff they have and like we'll just throw it up there and like I'll try and um, you know, basically work it out on stage because I know it's not like one of my own bits, like a form bit yet.

Speaker 4:          00:28:44       It's like something that I can work with him and that's fun too. That also like opened your mind to a whole other world of like joke writing and I'm sure especially you're doing it right next to another comic. Yeah, we started, we wrote it is difficult. We always start by talking about each other. They looked like an umpire during a rain delay. I'm actually wearing the same stuff right now, especially jeff mixes it up a bit. It's easier for me. Makes a statement. Let is a very clear David tail outfit. This is, it makes a statement. Flip phone. What? What's, what is it? I know how to delete a hard drive. I do. I do. Creep it up. Why do you still didn't answer about the flip phone? Why do you have a flip phone? Well, I like the flip phoney like you don't get distracted with the web because it takes forever to get the web on there. But uh, it's just, I don't know. I don't really like technology. I don't like the web. I feel like, um, you know, there's something about the virtual experience and the live experience that like we're, we're really in that world now of like coming to see someone live is getting harder and harder, but like they'll know all your clips on Youtube, you know? So I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:29:50       I think more people are going to CB beloved than ever before. Well Joe, not me. If there's any reason for that at all, it's definitely not your, your act because he's got to be content. It's your lack of connection with the Internet. If you are connected more with the Internet, more people would be going to see you. I'm not a good promoter. I know that I ever sent, believed that 100 percent believe that because you're, you're, it's hard to talk complimentary about someone there. Right in front of you. You're, you're brilliant. As a joke, right? Are you one of the most prolific? I know one of the most clever that I know, but you're also the. You have less ego than anyone I've ever met in my life. You're like some weird fucking Tibetan monk dude that's been sitting up in some cave somewhere mean you one of the best comics ever in my opinion. You're so. You're so low key. It freaks people out sometimes.

Speaker 4:          00:30:41       I, I, I'm all about the. I really love the hang. Like he was saying like the cult of the comics, like us hanging in, like coming from you dude. That's like extra special. So thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:30:51       To get recognized. I don't like any of that stuff, but why I think I've, I think there's a correlation. You're my own self hate more bandwidth for what you're doing. Your stand up, don't. You're looking at. It's a good mixture because you've obviously you've obviously been really successful with like staying in this group particularly after you stopped drinking and everything. You're, you're in this tight group present. That's what I can say. But you're sat at the Improv that I saw was about like six months. We were at the Improv together, something like that. Six months. God Damn. That was funny shit. But all the fun.

Speaker 4:          00:31:29       You know, it's funny like when you talk about like I love, there's no harder fan now than your fans. I mean like they know comedy, they know a lot of things and they totally respect the art form and like the craft of it and that's thanks to you and you're out there doing it. It's not like, you know, it's like back in the day I was a comic. You're out there every night to when you go on the road. So it's like you're talking from now, now from the past and you get it. How like, um, I, I feel like the web, the web stuff helps and hurts comedy to some degree, but it probably helps more than I'm giving it credit because it really did connect to people. It really did connect with more people. You know? I

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       think it helps or hurts. I think there's always been shit comedy and there's always people that are doing really well, but there's always been inspiring people and there's always been thieves. There's always been all the bad things that exist now and now it is. It's like way more people can find you and those people. It does translate into clubs and seats it they do want to come out and the thing about the show, the reason why this works is because we can all talk about it in a way that a person doesn't do it, can still understand it and then go, oh, there's these guys like this is what

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       you could be into. Whatever the fuck it is. Rebuilding muscle cars, playing chess, whatever the fuck it is that you're into. When people get really into something is a very similar thing that happens. Will you get together with other people that are also really into it and really good at it and he'd go, well, how are you? I'm always asking like, do you write it out? Like what do you do? Do you just work it out on stage d? How much time do you spend alone with the bit and how much time do you spend? How much do you love? Just because a lot of guys don't like to do anything outside of, right little tiny bullet points and then let it all express itself naturally on stage. Some of the best guys ever. Right. So it's hard to say what's right or what's wrong because

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       there's a lot of work to comedy that people don't get which is the writing, but it's also the listening to yourself like a taping and listening. That's the thing I have been doing. I have not been doing lately. We worked on this thing. I'm working on other stuff and it's like data is the thing where when I go back and go like, you know, when I was really hardcore into the, into like, you know, material turning an hour, that was the thing where it's like you almost have to like, like you telling me you have that tank, that's where like go in there with your act like especially like a hard show on a Friday, late, late show and like listen to it. That to me is like a form of torture to like all the bits that don't work late on Friday. Right. I disagree. I believe he's very optimistic. I'm very pessimistic. Optimistic. We'll. He really like. He really is like super optimistic. Friday, late shows. He loves everybody. I like the active audience. It fuels me. I feel like a lion tamer up there and when Davis beside me, I'm indestructable what's probably a really good man.

Speaker 5:          00:34:12       So for people that don't want to be quiet to don't want to yell out.

Speaker 4:          00:34:16       Yeah, get rowdy and drag people onstage. We go into the crowd. We do all those different things that like, you know, I'll say it, I'll say it. There's a lot of things that we do are like old school comedy in terms of like old school hockey, like it's just no longer done. It's like you could say it's, it might be a little cheesy, a little this, a little of that, but at the end of the day it's just inappropriate, fun, silly. Like move to the next bit. Like remember, we were looking into the edit and I go, hey, I got to tell you there's like a hundred punchlines in this thing. So even if like, you know, the law of averages like turtle swimming into the ocean, if only like seven or great, that's still a lot for an upper netflix special. I mean, honestly I'm not, I'm not patting ourselves on the back, but that's pretty good.

Speaker 4:          00:34:58       Our show is the episodes or three episodes of Friday. Well the first one's called Friday or Saturday and Sunday there three nights. Oh Wow. And I love that Friday crowd. And we had like Nikki Glaser, Amy Schumer, Rachel Feinstein, Michelle Wolf. You're talking about all the people that showed because we really like jeff called in these amazing people. Shut up. Gilbert was hilarious. Gilbert was, he completed us. You know what I'm talking about? Like he was the third piece of this, like ancient, like scroll. Once we found out, I was like, where's he been? Gilbert is the thing. Because you can give us like, yeah, that is the best one to savage. Yeah. I mean he's. What do you think of Gilbert? Like if okay, like your kids or whatever. Now I'm trying to think of like if you were like 16 years old, what would you think of guilt? Like he's so out of there, like, like wheelhouse in terms of like, what is that? I mean I think he's classic. I think he's like nobody else.

Speaker 6:          00:35:54       Tim, I think I probably thought he was really funny when I was 16, when I was 16. I was really getting into standup. Oh No. My parents took me to see live in the sunset strip when I was 14. I guess it was a movie theater. When I first discovered Gilbert, he was like on the MTV awards imitating dice. So to me he was like not hero comic. He was the guy that made fun of the hero. Right. He had the, you know, he was, he was always like, people would talk about him in interview. So it was always revered by other comedians. You know, he's a guy that's always been like, he's a wild man, like a legit wild man. He murdered in our show, like standing. Oh, we got a standing o w lately have like friends from our life in the audience, my aunt and his family and like Bruce Willis is there and he does a bit with this, but I had my friend Craig Moss from high schools in the audience with his wife and kids and Dave starts walking around the village underground looking for my guest list.

Speaker 6:          00:36:51       Craig Moss, where's Craig Moss? So finally, like they started goofing on, this guy was just in the audience. So that was a long jump in and go and I jump in and go, Oh, you know, Craig, when my parents died, craig was my best friend in a new town. He was, you know, so I'm explaining to the audience and Dave who this guy is and how much he did for me as a young man. And uh, and then Gilbert jumps up out of the audience and just screams, doesn't even need a microphone. He was like, when my parents were alive, Greg came over and

Speaker 4:          00:37:21       killed them and says, perfect timing. He never, he does. He's just his delivery. He's an animal. No filter with him. And that's the beauty of him, like, you know, I'm always like, ah, I don't know what, how they're going to take. He's like, boom, that's it. I think I'm going to say three times. You know, the kids who love comedy would love him, but I was 16. I mean, I, I, I would listen to everything. I always like a mix of different types of comics. Like that episode, Bob Saget and Hassan Minhaj or the other guests at one point were all up there together and you, these are guys who might not even know each other in real life, but the comedy kind of brings it together. That's awesome. It's like a party mixed with a roast mixed with A. I don't even know Dave. No, it's really cool because Jeff's family, like wherever we would go on the road, just family, you know, it'd be like, can I get your comps?

Speaker 4:          00:38:16       Because I, you know, I've got like three third cousins. I didn't know there were Jews in Oklahoma, but evidently there were five distinct 23 and me people out there for me. And I was like, it was funny to see because I'm really a lone wolf, like I'm on the road alone, you know, I go out there, I do my thing and jeff really does like, he's very with his family, so I give him a lot of credit for that. Like, you know, they're all invited to come hang out in the green room and all that kind of stuff. So that's cool. And he brought that on stage with your aunt. I thought that was like one of the best moments of the whole show. You know,

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       we bring up my aunt is the first episode is, is my aunt Bruce Willis, Michelle Wolf. Amy Schumer, Nikki Glaser, Rachel. So it's like a weird mix of. But you know what for, for just to say one more thing about Dave and the flip phone and like how the process works. Dave is also the most, like you say, president, but also informed like he knows all the references, he knows what's going on in the world. So he's not like he's living in a cave man under the, under the eye. I keep my eye out there. So what do you do? Do you read newspapers? I have a raven sent me, sent me the most important news from Westeros isn't, uh, by uh, he's in the back reading and like really like getting in touch with the world and the audience and he's the first one to say, Oh, we're in Vegas. Let's talk about this. That's going on in Vegas. Let's talk about that in Vegas. You know, it. He'll say an unstaged to me. Like he'll bring up all this relevant stuff where like, I'm the son of a caterer. I'm more about this live experience. Who's in the audience? Who is here

Speaker 4:          00:39:49       keeping it to like, that's that show. And I think you agree with it. It's like, Yo agree with it too is like each show is its own thing, right? So it's like, you know, the fact that it's always like some guy taping in the back, you're like, dude, why are you doing that? Because this is your experience right now. And you know, you know, like Stan Hope, who is my favorite comic, Doug Stan hope is like, he was the first guy that like we both talked about like this whole thing of like why do people think that like, you know, capturing this show is like important. And like, you know, they're also disposable. It's like beautiful, like fireworks, you know, it's like, it's never gonna. It's never gonna happen again. Like that, you know, so you might as well just soak it all in instead of trying to capture it.

Speaker 4:          00:40:26       And I think when, when we talk about like topical stuff, I do that for like as a joke raggedy thing, but also as a, keeping the act alive because I feel like my job in this team is to push it forward. Like, you know, it's like, Okay Jeff, what else is happening? Like to keep moving it. Otherwise we can't. We can always get into a loop of like, you know, just putting each other down or like working the crowd. So I like to move it forward. And I think that the, uh, the cool thing about that is that like it does, it does move forward to an end, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:40:55       people are making those videos, they're not making those videos to look back on them to making those videos so that other people could see it. Right. But the difference between today and the past, are you for that or you are against it? I'm not, I'm neither. I think your, your personal experience is going to be better if you just watch it, but I'm not, you. Maybe you, maybe you just get more of a jolly off of filming a clip and putting that clip on facebook and they're getting a million downloads. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       I just know that like when I go to a place and I'm working on new material, I want it to be figured out and then then put it on the way I want it. But I totally understand what you're saying, which is like, you know, the uh, you know, like it's, it's a, it's an open, it's an open

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       world now and it's just like the idea of controlling is like an antiquated idea. But I think that for me, at least as the joke writer, it's like I just want it to where it's where it's going to be and then get it out. You understand? They're not going to completely agree. I think we, if we established an etiquette, you know, and most comedy clubs say you can't film. There's a reason. Yeah. I don't know what, like I have a bit right now that I'm working on and I've only done it twice and it's all over the fucking place in the. If I somehow or another released it, like if I had to do a Netflix special tomorrow and it had to do that bit, I'd be fucked. I'd be like, what is this? This malformed gelatinous preposterous. Yeah. You're working on if a joke yet, but sick.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       I know for a fact that six months from now there's fruit in this. I know the subject is, there's something to it to figure out what that something is and it's gonna take a while and it's going to be a lot of missteps. Yeah. There's just no way around it. And the only way for us to do this, it's like if you are a musician, I'm sure it feels awesome to practice in front of a crowd, but you can practice at home. Like you can actually get the band together and play the whole song. Right? We can't do that. I'm glad you brought that up because people always bring music as like, you know, it's kind of like music. I'm like, it's Kinda not like music, the audience. It's not like music at all. If anything I really, you know, talk about like self hate for a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       I'm like, how come like, my bits don't rock like within six months. And I'm like, you know, then I started like, like directors and writers and when I, everybody has first drafts, everybody has it and like the best people have multiple drafts and it's the same thing with a joke where it's like it'll work and then it won't work. And then you'll change a line and then it'll work better and they won't. And you're feeling it out. You're feeling out that you and your head are filling in the holes that you only can see because it's, you're the creator and I love that process, but it also is terrifying. You know, it really is like where is it going to go? But basically saying, okay, that's finished now because it got like a little laugh. You're like, I'm not satisfied. There's something. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:43:35       Yeah. But you have a, you have a real issue with this because they will get a joke, you know, I'm sure he's the creator and he knows where the destroyer are. Go ahead. But no one is more connected to him. Then me watching the process, right. He's on tour and doing like, you know, a week of shows. I know, we know each other's moves and we see how it develops. He'll finally get a joke, not where it's killing, where it's like a showstopper, like killing, like what do we do now where I run around a circle, like the jokes hitting so hard that we have to do something while there are laughing, you know, take a sip or some will just roll around on the floor and I'll destroy it. And then the next night I'll go, Dave, what's your workout routine like? I'll give him a softball layup to go like this joke. And he'll look at me like I'm speaking another language because I'm already just be like in his eyes. Fuck you joe. I'm not repeating

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       myself night today. And he'll deconstruct and completely rearrange the same joke. I will. I will turn that funny until like a boring couch. Ikea that joke into a snooze fest. Isn't that so the mindset that keeps you present while bit and keeps him present? It keeps me like I really am letting down the team. They're like, feed me, feed me. And I'm like, no. But, uh, I think that's the full of it. I also like have a problem with it. If a joke works continuously somewhere, I'm like, there's something wrong with that. Attacks goes wrong. Netflix special. And you're not using your aim material. No, dude, I, I had, uh, you know, I think of the jokes is children. I gave up a lot of my, uh, you know, my first born there or the ugly ones, my pharmacist joke, my homeless joke. It's because it's so important to have that mindset to be a great club comic. Right? Because the show has to be its own thing, you know, that's, that keeps you like, restart

Speaker 3:          00:45:35       for every show. There's nothing worse. There's nothing worse than seeing somebody go over and over and over there. Same thing every year. You see them. It's terrible. That's sad. Well, because it could be so much better. That's what you like as a person who's a comic. You understand what they're doing. They just don't want to take any chances. But as a person who's, you know, also you know how good it feels to write something new and eventually get it to the point where you could say it, Gilbert Gilbert live this hilarious, right? So like, but for years, like he's gotten out of it now, but for years he wouldn't update as material and I took him, my sister and my brother in law and John Stamos, we all went to see him at Caroline's when Gilbert's up there. Let's just like three years ago doing like Calista flockhart

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       can you not even update and we're just

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       dying. And by the way like stainless is criticizing him. He's like whispering in my ear. I heard that five years ago, I heard that tenure. I go, you're on Broadway doing Chicago

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       30 or 40 50 year old play, what are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          00:46:38       But. So I defended Gilbert, but I did like I did talk to Gilbert and Dara and like, like Gilbert, you're too funny to, to not evolve like your first hitting your prime as a comedian. And now to his credit he's like on another level he's just, that's great though, that you've inspired them to start running again. I embarrassed him to start writing again. That's fucking great. But he,

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       when he's with us, like when that thing I said to Jeff, I go, if we ever tour again, we have to bring him on some of these cakes because he really does like he was the third element of this, this whatever chemistry of the thing that really did for me at least I always knew that like if it wasn't going anything with me and Jeff and that's the truth of it too. And people will see that in the show that there's, you know, there's a couple of bits that go nowhere, but we left them in to show people that it's real and all that kind of stuff. But what about getting norm? Did you guys do anything with Doris? I wish we could do something with norms kind of thing on Netflix. Yeah. But

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       he was in the, in La. We were in New York and another dude, he's so God damn,

Speaker 4:          00:47:36       I wish you would normally stand up. I'm not saying we will, but if we ever do this again, this pumping MC state, we should get norm. Did you see his tweets, his Thanksgiving tweets? No. No. Once again, on my flip phone friends, I retweeted it. He's just so ridiculous, man. So funny. There's something about norms, just like his ability to, uh, you know, I have this thing about timing. I don't know what you think about it, but it was like there's something about that timing that like, you know, I know in today's world that people don't care about that. It's more about identity and all that stuff, but like norm is a master of timing. He really is like a master of timing and this whole thing that he's trying to do is finding these classic jokes. I love that. No, he's genius. He's, he's one of the road gigging

Speaker 3:          00:48:19       opening for norm. Really probably road gig ever. Nineteen 91. Maybe. I'm a catch Princeton somehow. I talked my way into an MC spot and rich vos was the middle and norm was normally normally the only famous for doing a few late night shows whatever. Wasn't Letterman at the time. What was the other one? Uh, was it thick of the night or something? Or Bob Costas? No, it was, it was a leader with Bob costs. It wasn't as cool as that. Even bill boggs, it was going to give you some some show you'll remember in a few minutes and you go, oh yeah, like syndicated whatever it was, but like I meet norm and he's catch prints them and he'd do an hour to 45 minutes every show. He either destroyed or he got zero lasts for 45 minutes and whenever he got zero laugh, he would stand by the door and say goodbye to people as they left.

Speaker 3:          00:49:20       Oh, that's great. And if he killed, he would go back up to the room with Boston and we would play poker like he was. He was still up for us. And then while we were there last, he got booked on Letterman for the first time and I had a jeep. My sister bought me a jeep, but the money she got from a car accident and I drove to norm the best. Hi Robin. And I drove. I drove norm to his letter taping his first letter. That's incredible. Cool. I learned a lot that week. That's what a great guy to have. The first guy opened for them. It was so funny. That's amazing. Todd Barry was so obsessed with norm. He came out and flipped on my bed. First Guy I ever opened for was a guy named Warren. Mcdonald's is really funny, like old school veteran Boston comic, but the second guy opened for was Lenny Clarke. Atlanta Clark gave me advice that was totally contrary to his brother's advice, but he's Mike Clark, who's the best, nicest guy. I love Mike. He helped me. He's. He's fucking awesome. My book me back when nobody would book me when I was just starting out, but he

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       was. When I opened for lenny goes, he goes, kid, you have funny, but you're too fucking dirty. He said, yeah, you just told me like, yeah. He was like, you should kind of clean your act up, and then Lenny Clarke came off stage. He goes, whatever you do, don't clean your act up until them kid. He gave me great advice. That's strong. Those two guys than Isis there. So Boston too. When I was going to be used into the core and when I. When I was preparing a roast of the Boston cops and Mike really helped me, like warm up, got me a bunch of local gigs in the Boston flavor. Oh beautiful. For the Irish people, Italian people, it's a good place to do comedy, man.

Speaker 4:          00:51:13       That is definitely of the two towns I'm thinking right now. Boston and Philly are the two towns that have changed dramatically. Comedically. And also just in terms of like, like when you walk around in Boston now you're not like, Hey, I'm going to get jumped, you know, because I'm wearing a Yankee, you know, if anything it's like, you know, everybody here is so like metro and you know, someone's gonna invite me to like a poetry reading at a, at a wine bar or something like that. It's very metro and the comedy there was still good, but it's funny, that old Boston was such a challenge. It really was like, especially the outsiders. What year did you start going, going into next? In their nineties, you know, and every time it dreaded it. Yeah, they really were. They were, they were battles every time

Speaker 2:          00:51:54       and they had local headliners that could destroy you. The greatest comics ever offstage.

Speaker 4:          00:51:59       It was, it was definitely one of those things. You were terrified what you would hear just like, hey, you know what, I'm a Giana. I don't know what to tell you about. Um, Gavin might come down like he just wants to do a few minutes. Yeah. They would go on stage just to fuck with you. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I, back then, I don't know if it's still like that for people starting out, but comics were me, but that was their town and they and they, and they saw you coming into their town and they were like, you know, you better, you better prove it. You know, it's like before step up revolution, you had a, you had to own and never hold grudges. I don't know why. I'd never people who were Douchey to me in the beginning, I'm like, I don't know. It wasn't ready for your response.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Respect. I'll learn it eventually. That's a great attitude. But Hackett to that, to me once, he said, when you're holding a grudge together, guys out dancing, it's a great piece of waste energy. You know, there was a horrible Hackett though going on. What was going on back then was a famine mentality and I don't think we have that anymore. I think that famine mentality is gone because now everybody realizes that with the Internet there's, there's literally an unlimited amount of viewers and people that could come to your gigs and it's way more beneficial for them to know that you, if you're talking about someone that's really good for them to know, you have good. Like

Speaker 5:          00:53:25       if Dave says, oh, you gotta. See Jeff Ross is fucking hilarious comedian. And I go, well, I love Dave, so he must be right. You know what I'm saying? And this is, this is, this is the not having a famine mentality. That's the thing that fucked us back in the early days, like in Boston, it was before my time because when I came along, they had already started. Steven Wright had been on, was he on Letterman? Jay Leno had already taken off and he was on Letterman all the time. Those guys had already broken through to tv, but there was a sense that some of them had that like, where's mine? Like, how come I didn't salute? Yeah, there was a tiny amount of slots. It's not like Steven Wright couldn't go on Letterman. He'd say, Hey, you think I'm funny? You got to see this Guy Lenny Clarke, or you gotta. See this Guy Don Gavin are you got to see Steve Sweeney. All these murders that he came up with and they were all like, where's mine? Like, what the fuck

Speaker 4:          00:54:20       you just like in my head to have too few spots, but also like we're of the generation and that's not to make this like a whole like trip to the museum, a comedy, but we're of the generation where we actually saw people who crush a room, like crush room. Like today. I was like, oh, you killed it. You crushed it. But like seeing Richard Jenny at his height, like, hey caroline's, or something like that. Crushed that room. People leaving exhausted where it's like two hours in. You're like, oh, he hasn't even hit his this thing yet, and he's like, he'll get off the stage. He's like, ah, what did you think of that tag? I'm like, which? I'm like, dude, you like throw like a million jokes up there. I would watch that and be like, oh my God, that's terrifying to see. It was like watching a wave come at you, and it was like what people consider now killing a room or crushing a room. Like I never got to see Sam Kennison or any of those people live, but I assume that was the same thing of where people could not breed. They leave the room, like just going like, Oh man, I'm just like exhausted.

Speaker 5:          00:55:15       I got to see Kennison. But I didn't get to see him until after he released his HBO special and after he released his hbo special, all that material was gone. Like what I would've wanted to see was that because that was like a culmination of 10 years of doing standup and then boom, he does that hbo special and it's just, I'm a murderous nuclear missile that's. But I saw him after that. What year was that? He did the HBO because I wonder what year when I saw, I think it was either 85 or 86. I think it was 86, so five plummet. Rascal for the sold out show and I was in college and I knew how funny he was. He was probably already famous old. Was He at rascals? Wouldn't be doing a bigger venue by the guests. You're right, because I remember it felt like a special event.

Speaker 5:          00:55:58       I saw him at theaters. I saw him at a couple of big places. I saw him at one place down the Cape. It was, I want to say it was like if I had a guest today, I would say somewhere around 2000 seats and I saw him at great woods, which is considerably larger than that and that's right after his hbo special and this is 80. This is 86. 80 seven. Wow. It's like a work of great words. Did you shut the fuck up? I was. I worked for Wbur, the the public radio station and I would record classical music concerts as a. As a. As an engineer. They called it Tanglewood or something. What'd they call? Great Woods. You have a great woods and Mansfield. Yeah. Yeah. I was a security guard there that have been weird. If you're better than linkedin. How did you guys.

Speaker 5:          00:56:46       I was reluctant security guard because I would always bring a Hoodie with me and if shit went down I'd cover up my security jacket and get the fuck out of dodge that you'd throw in. I brought, brought a Hoodie with me. I have to like my first couple of days in the job, the first day on the job, there's a dude named alley cat. He was a dude who ran the security. They caught some drunk kid who stole a golf cart, so they chased him down, tackled him, and he was beating him in the face with a walkie talkie. That was day one and I was like, oh right. It's one of these jobs and it was a. and I'm not a big person. I'm five foot eight outside the fight looking in. Yes, exactly. Right. So and back then I was competing so I was only like 160 pounds.

Speaker 5:          00:57:31       I was really lightens, I was not getting any tangles with some big giant drunk dudes. I'm like, fuck for 20 bucks an hour or whatever I'm getting, so it just bring a Hoodie with me and when Shit went down it would zip up and one day shit went down a neil young concert and they wow. During the Neil Young concert, the back area is all grass and they started bonfires. These fucking crazy neil young fans through a bunch of shit on the ground. Just started fires and then they started trying to break up these fires and people were pushing security guards and then my friend Larry, who was like the nicest guy in the world, punch this guy in the stomach and I'm like, okay, that's it. If Larry's punching people, like he's the nicest guy, but like these people are crazy. I put the fucking Hoodie on and I'm out.

Speaker 5:          00:58:17       I just walked straight to my car and drove the fuck home. I didn't realize paycheck, nothing. I'm like, I'm out. Full blown riot. Two dudes were throwing down and piles of people beating the shit out of each other. There was fires, they canceled the concert, they shut the concert in the middle of what's happening for Nila. Who is the opener? That was the problem. It was the, it was, there was two problems sometimes when you were in the back area where the grass was, the acoustics weren't so good. So like when people went to see comics it was bad. It's not good. Like maybe they fixed the sound, but back then it was a big issue you had inside the canopy to hear what the fuck was going on. What do you think

Speaker 4:          00:58:55       a odd ball in like outdoor comedy, what do you think of that?

Speaker 5:          00:58:59       I've done some outdoor things. I did a big outdoor place in Kansas City this year and it was really fun. It was really an awesome. Yeah. But it was a summer night, you know, it was beautiful. We got lucky with the rain. There was no rain or anything

Speaker 4:          00:59:11       when Jeff and I did, uh, the odd ball, like we went on together. That was my most fun doing the odd ball thing and I always thought it was a great. Like jeff was a super cool to comics and everything like that. Like the only guy I've ever seen, like actually looked like he's having a great time with Chappelle doing it. Like I really like. He's so comfortable everywhere. But like in the outdoor venue, you know, he's taking his time and there's a club. Yeah. Like I, I, it's just amazing to watch them do it. But the outdoor thing with the kid never here, you know, like the joke going off into outer space. That definitely is, is, is something that um, you know, even the theater in the round, which is one I saw Rodney Dangerfield, they when I was like 17 and that was another situation where this guy is just like crushing, crushing, crushing and the room cannot breathe, that kind of thing. And I was like, this isn't in the round, you know? I was like, wow, that's weird. You know, I was 17. I was like, wow, is this how it goes? Like, you know, why is he circling around like that? Is that, is that part of it? You know, I didn't understand that it was in the round, you know, but that, but now I realize that that's another like really hard venue to play is the round, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:00:09       Yeah. I've only done a few of those. Uh, did the, uh, that place in Phoenix. That one's in the round Hollywood theater. That's a, that's a great. Oh, I know that you did one of his hps was there and because George Carlin did one right? I think so, yeah. He did so many of them, like I did them everywhere. I mean every year that is bananas. That's one of the craziest places ever. And talk about someone who did it totally differently. He would basically write a monologue. Right. You know, it's, take us out, work at it at all, not working out, kind of tightened it up on stage. They would say, you know, as you know, the bits as you would just keep doing them and figure out a better way to do them, but write it, write the whole thing. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And he did it every year. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:00:51       That was like at the height of that hbo comedy thing, you'd like tune in specific just to see

Speaker 5:          01:00:55       national. Well he was in a different place than anybody else because of how prolific he was and some some would say like, yeah, but some of it wasn't my favorite stuff and like listen, it is impossible to write an hour every fucking year and have it your best version of that hour. You need more time a lot of the times. But he had an honor. That commitment of getting the special right, but what he did was he did something that was slightly different than comedy either because it was even because it was like a lot of it was like a state of the union, a state of civilization. The state wasn't just comedy. It's like here's a really wise old guy. He was super smart but he has some really good points and he's going to do this every year. So it was, it was, it was different. It was more that it wasn't like he never worked out in clubs. Like I went to see him once and he was. He had this whole bit about fuck everything. It was like basically fuck this and fuck that, and part of it was comedy clubs. He's like, they say, George, you got to work out. You're shitting comedy. He fuck comedy clubs. Really?

Speaker 5:          01:01:59       I saw him years later the store. I mean it was just fucking around. That's when I knew I'd made it. I was at the Improv back in the day and I was probably going on at 2:00 AM and I still have it. It was a schedule that had George Carlin going on 30 for like five hours later. I went onto the prom show or something, but Carlin came into the Improv. I got to say hi to

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       him in the back patio. The store just. Hi, how you doing? Nice to meet you. Yeah. I was like, wow.

Speaker 4:          01:02:26       I saw him at the Aspen comedy festival with comics. Oh sorry. Yeah, no, no, he, he definitely.

Speaker 2:          01:02:31       So hang on with comics necessarily. Right? I remember once like he kinda like just the friars club. He's like, I don't want to hang with the older guys I want to. It was weird.

Speaker 4:          01:02:41       I saw them at the Aspen comedy festival and he was like, not doing anything, like, you know, he had like substance stuff going on and it was like he was treated himself to one glass of wine a day, but you know, how like up to the brim, like it's one of those where it's like, hey, you see like sipping on it, you know, like, and he's looking at me like, hmm, you know, like, he's like, oh, he's a new comic. He's a big, you know, I'm like, hello, Mr Carlin. And he's like, hmm. And back to the sipping on this one glass of wine a day. I love that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       Well he, he, he got injured right hand the pain pill problem. Oh Daddy. So many fucking people, man. He was a hardcore guy too. Well, yeah, he did a lot of that back in the day. But I think the uh, pain pills was later on in his life and he just said, reached a point where he realized I've got an issue. I've got to stop this. But he, he, I respect that he really committed to his craft and you know, maybe he was trying to do other stuff here and there because he did a few acting things, but that was not his thing. His thing was hbo specials every year. Well, no, no one else was doing there. You figure out what your thing is. Lucky happened. Yeah. Well his thing was always, you know, having a brilliant social point with humor attached to it. That was his thing. Like some of his best bits were just like really good points about hypocrisy and the ridiculousness of our civilization with like really good punchline. He would write to a subject. Does that too.

Speaker 4:          01:04:09       He also like a religion. He was like the first guy to really like him and Bill Hicks I always thought were like, you know, that was so cool. Their takes on religion, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       Yeah. Well, you know, Lenny Bruce obviously opened that door that opened the door and it was a pain in the ass to get used to Tommy about lenny bruce. And he was just a pain in the ass. They got everybody in trouble all the time. There'd be cops, comedy clubs and Shit. You can't be that guy unless you're a pain in the ass. I mean, he was arrested multiple times. So what do we have that bad words like? I like. Yeah, yeah. I think. I don't think we need a guy like him in a sentence like crowded, difficult guy if you live today, right? You know, I mean if he was alive today, he would just be a great comic. He wouldn't, he wouldn't have to do all the shit that he had to do. Like if there was, it's hard for us to. Whenever you go back and listen to stuff like lenny bruce, it's really almost impossible unless you live through it that time yourself in that time to put it. That's why like I can kind of put myself back in the eighties. I can kind of remember vaguely. I have a sense of what it was like. I can kind of tell you, I don't have goddamn clue as

Speaker 5:          01:05:17       to what it was like in the sixties and so when he was doing this, we have to put it in context that there was no, there was no freedom. You couldn't say certain words, you couldn't talk. Yeah, I mean really crazy restrictions on the way people talked and they brought him into court over and over and over again. Essentially bankrupt them. He couldn't work anymore and by the end he just died of heroin on the fucking bathroom floor and then he became a mess and a lot of him bms was him dealing with his court cases like he's got. There's recordings of him where he's going on stage with his legal papers. Just reading the diversity of the audience. He lost his fucking mind,

Speaker 4:          01:05:56       but we also came up in a club system and I consider myself a club comic. Like that's what I do. That's what I'm supposed to do. But like these guys were before, like you say, Hackett and all these guys way before the club system, they played the catskills. They played some, you know, a Jewish camp somewhere, you know, they did that kind of thing that was there, like proving ground and I'm sure that was probably the hardest of the hardest gigs to do. You know, it's like, it's an all ages show. It's, you know, there may be a late show where they get to be a little saucier, but you know, it really is a tough thing and it's the same crowd for a whole week. I mean honestly, you know, that's crazy. Yeah. So like I give it up to those guys like Joan rivers who I think also is like an unsung hero comedy. Like she, she's like, crosses over that thing from like TV comedies becomes like a big deal. Like where you see them on like a Johnny Carson, all that kind of stuff. Like I love her sets. I watched them one. Yeah, she really was a great joke writer. She was really young. Savage

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       to. She'd go after it. Well, who else stayed relevant and they're at 80 years old. Who else had new material at 80? No, but it's really just those two. Just Carlin and her. I guess so, right? I mean, who else? And she died trying to improve her voice. Her instrument, like she was still staying in it. Sad one. I was at her funeral. It was a really amazing. It was like a king died. She was the greatest. She had some serious fucking horsepower when it came to like her ability to deliver punchlines and one of the best books I ever read. Young comics out there read, enter talking by Joan rivers about her early days in stand up and acting. It's really don't read ladies and gentlemen, Lenny Bruce will start putting foil over your windows and shooting up. I, I, I did read that. It's a great book.

Speaker 3:          01:07:40       So I started, I took a comedy class in New York who was teaching Lee Frank, buddy of mine. He's asking his writing and I was fat loser living in New Jersey with my grandfather and my buddy said, hey, take this comedy class. I think you'd be good at it. I go, what? They think, yeah, I think you'd be good at it. And I thought, well, it's near the bus station where I would go to work. And then go visit my grandpa and take care of him. He was sick and and I would just go to this class for three hours. It was like a way to socialize really. I didn't have a desired. I didn't even know what stand up was, but the first assignment was to memorize a comedian's act and do it just for the class. Just to get a sense of timing and what it was like.

Speaker 3:          01:08:23       We understood it wasn't our material. It wasn't about that at all. And I didn't. I had heard Lenny Bruce was the coolest. So I went to the springfield public library. I took out a lenny bruce that live at Carnegie Hall Double Album. I still have it and I remember I had this routine and I didn't get it the that the class didn't get it. And I realized like God, context is everything. It just didn't make. It just wasn't funny. It didn't hold up at all. It made almost no sense to me. So I realized that it really is, like you were saying before, Dave, like the moment the tide isn't the experience of being there.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       People were so restricted back then in terms of their access to information in terms of the way they talk to each other that anything outside of the norm, anything being broadcast, and we have to also remember that broadcasting itself was only like 40 or 50 years old, so this is a fairly new medium. Right, and anything that was even remotely just outside of what the ics excepted standard operating were behaving was was considered decadent and racy enlists dirty lenny. They would. He would talk about things that you're not supposed to talk about that. Yeah, the taboo subjects, but today that same stuff has already been. He opened the door, Richard Pryor kicked it down, lit it on fire. Eddie Murphy nuclear bombed it and then it kept going on Kennison and Hicks and it's those. There's nothing there anymore. There is no shame in any of these subjects anymore.

Speaker 5:          01:09:51       You can't. There's no built in weirdness to it that he experienced back then and he would've never been able to do comedy any differently. I think that's also what we need to understand as if like Eddie Murphy went back to 1960 and did his same kind of material that he did in Ra, they wouldn't take, it wouldn't, everybody would be like, he's yelling at us like, what is he doing? This is not comedy. Like they wouldn't be ready for it there. There's these stages that have to happen and I think you kind of have to have a guy like lenny who's a spelling it out for people and then a guy like Carlin takes it to a different place and then uh, and then they just keep going and prior comes along and introduces this incredible honesty to it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:33       It's like each comic had one less layer of exposition in there as almost like they opened for each other

Speaker 5:          01:10:39       decade or by five years most. Right. So interesting. And Kennison, when kinison came around, it was the first time that I'd ever saw something and went, oh, well, that the comedy can be anything. Yeah. Because I thought that comedy was these guys who would go on the tonight show because that's mostly what I'd see where they would go to. You ever notice and they will be talking about stuff they noticed and I loved it. I would love standup comedy, but I never. I never thought that standup comedy was anything like Kennis. And when I saw Kenneth for the first time I was like, oh, this is a totally different thing. Like this guy's doing a totally different thing. Like this is crazy. He's still going to enter anxious monologue when he was standing in front of a guy going, you know, you look at this face, you didn't marry. Look at this stage. I was married twice. I was married for two fucking years old. No, but nobody had ever done anything like that before. And I remember thinking at that time like, wow, comedy is really fascinating because it can be so many different things,

Speaker 4:          01:11:38       but you also want it to be a rockstar. So rockstar, but that. But when you see all those great things that he could do, like his staged craft, I guess you would call it, the things he could do, he could really hold the stage. And in today's world where it's pretty much everyone's located, that's Kinda like the new style of like low key whatever like that. That to me always was like, he was like a force of nature. That's what I was like. It was like this guy. Like somebody opened the door in a hurricane came in. She knows. I love that.

Speaker 5:          01:12:04       He has something very seriously in common. Roseanne, yeah. They both experienced significant head injuries at a young age. From then on became this new person. Roseann had the exact same story. She got hit by a car that she got fucked up. She was in a mental hospital for nine months. I mean really bad. So when, when people talk about Roseanne and say bad things about him, like you really are doing, I didn't know that everyone a disservice by expressing this the way you're doing it because you're not even taking into consideration everything she does. You should take into consideration. She had a significant brain, a massive trauma to the brain when she was 15 years old, right. Her head bounced off of the fender of a fucking car. She was laid out. She was in a coma. She was in a mental institution for nine months after that.

Speaker 5:          01:12:54       Like this is like asking someone who has broken legs to not limp. Even when you are asking. Even when you. I heard you talked to her about it. She almost like skipped over it as if it was something she didn't really want to address. And you were like backtracked. She had I, I had to get it out of her because this is what I know about her and she, she knows that I'm a giant fan. Like she knows. I always say if you have to list like top 20 comics of all time, Roseanne is 100 percent in there and probably one of the most important ones because what she did when she first got on Hbo, when she first, when people first start, she would, first of all, she would fucking murder domestic on it. She would murder and she. She had a totally different style.

Speaker 5:          01:13:37       Her, she didn't give a fuck like when she was up there as a first time you saw a woman who was like aggressive and insulting and didn't give a fuck. Didn't give a fuck what she looked like, didn't give a fuck what you thought about what she looked like. She was just there to be funny and she knew that I had that, that opinion ever when she did the show. So it helped. It helped. Like I'm not trying to hurt you in any way and I just want people to understand who you are. She's a fucking bunch of different psych medicines, man. They've got her on all kinds of crazy shit trying to move it around. And then on top of that she's taken and she's drinking and like everybody relax. Leave that poor lady alone like you're going after when she's in her sixties for a fuck up on twitter.

Speaker 5:          01:14:21       You thinks that that lady looks black is lying. You're either full of shit. Like if you didn't know if I said okay, you don't know anything about her, what's the ethnicity? You'd be like, Oh, a boy, right. You know, I've got, I, I saved the picture on my phone in case I get into conversation with people about it because it's such a. because it's one of those things where nobody wants to look like they are in any way racist, right? No one wants to look at their racist. Right? I don't want to, but you also have to be honest, doesn't mean you're racist. If you look at that and go thought that was saying that Herman, she could be a lot of things. She could be a lot of things. She has long, straight hair or not long, short, straight hair like she can be a lot of things. This is not obvious for you. Say that. It's obvious you're being disingenuous. I can't talk to you because you're not being. You're not realistic. This is not obvious. It shouldn't be tweeting about politics and middle of the night on ambient. Well, she also shouldn't be tweeting about lizard people or any other crazy shit. She tweets about trails and right

Speaker 4:          01:15:18       before her Cheryl, when she went from comedy to her show and once again it was uh, you know, uh, like her act was her show and like that was one thing that like since her, everybody was always like, you know, you got to like throw out in your act like 20 minutes about like what you are and who you think the sitcoms should be. And it was like, it didn't work as well for anybody else except for her because that really was her life. And it was her thing like Ray Romano was another guy was really good at that where he would put up, you know, his act. He's really great joke writer too. He was like totally like had these great jokes about his family and his wife and the expectations of their relationship. And then that became the essence of that show so that you see, like everybody, you remember that it was definitely a decade of like agents going like, hey, you gotta get like, you know, you know, did you have a dog growing up? Do a joke about that you. And get a sitcom going on there.

Speaker 5:          01:16:09       I went through all that shit when they were trying to do sitcoms around people and they would try to get you to put together like some sort of a theme and do it on stage for a sitcom. I'm seeing guys specifically craft and act that they thought was going to get 12 minutes. Yup. Yes. People got seriously into it, man. It became like a different thing. It's like a goal. The goal was the Sitcom. The Lachlan was another one. Did you like those days acting? I got lucky. Okay. I got super lucky. I got super lucky first of all, I'd never had my own show. All right. So never had to carry anything. And then two, I did a really shitty one. First a one that should have been really funny, but then too many people got involved and it got too convoluted and fucked up and it just didn't work.

Speaker 5:          01:16:47       And that show got canceled. And then I got lucky that I got on a show that was already. They already did the pilot, when I came onto news radio, Ray Romano was supposed to do the pirate, the pilot rather he gets fired. They hired a new guy and then they filmed the pilot and then after they filmed the pilot, they got rid of the new guy and then I came in that. So there was a, there was a lot of steps. So you jumped the hard part of jumped off it and I. But I mean creatively, there's no way you found that fulfilling. Maybe at the time of news radio was unusually free in how much you could create. You could constantly. Paul sams is a genius and the nicest guy in the world and he would let you, like, he would just use no ego whatsoever.

Speaker 5:          01:17:30       The Best Shit. Like he would let Dave Foley was constantly rewriting jokes and constantly introducing new punchlines. So he, he, he was like, you know, probably one of, if you look at all the punchlines that had ever been on the show, I'll like a percentage of them you would attribute to date photo, like a significant percentage. It's genius, but they would let them do it. They wanted everybody to do that. They wanted only job where you want to do more than you're supposed to do and you're like mad if he did all that. Well, there was eight people in the show too. It's a lot of human beings to be talking for 22 minutes and of course Phil was the star. Phil Hartman was.

Speaker 4:          01:18:03       He was so talented. That guy super talented.

Speaker 5:          01:18:05       He. He was also super professional. I would prepare. You would have. He would have a clipboard, right, or a notebook with all of his scenes in there with different colors for the tabs and he would practice them. You'd be. You'd see him sitting there by himself just going over his lines, moving his head back and then after. Yeah. I mean he was a fucking meticulous professional. Like I said,

Speaker 4:          01:18:30       I'm just saying. I'm just saying about like some guys, especially the comics where they go and they get that, that microphone. Oh, sorry about the comics. They get the Sitcom and then they ride it as long as they can and then then they go back to stand up and we've seen that, you know, you can throw a dart at like a schedule anywhere in the country and you'll see that guy and I'm on. I'm always like, you know what? Isn't it sad that you didn't keep doing the standup because now you're kind of right back to where you started in terms of standup. Like he didn't get to grow that way apart. Yeah. And I don't do it for years and like everybody's always like, you know, this is the best touring time when you have a sitcom, but most people don't want to go on tour like that, you know? To me I would be like, yeah, you're right. Let's get out there. You know, but well you, you could do it for a few months, but yeah, the schedule

Speaker 5:          01:19:13       you're filming, you're going to be stuck at in La. And then on top of that, especially back then when you start out a sitcom, you're doing 12 hour days until you figured out how to do it. True. Once the show had been figured out by like season three or four, we were down to like three days a week, sometimes four days a week. Mostly. Mostly for very rarely five, unless there was some significant crazy semination make we did 98 I think. Wow. We just did three, maybe [inaudible] 99, something like that. But, um, I did a hundred and 48 fear factors. Wow. Then I did six more than we did when, when it came back six or seven more. I think we did seven but 48. Yeah. That was preposterous. That was when I was losing my mind. Wasn't even one a day or was it less than. Well, no one took three days. Sometimes you could bang out one, two days. Like you could have the beast on early in the day and at night, like the final stone at night.

Speaker 5:          01:20:14       Um, you know, again, very fortunate. It was a great gig. Plenty of money and it was all good. It definitely helped my standup because it gave me fuck you money too. It gave me the ability to not worry about like having money in the bank because I'm not, I don't have like extravagant tastes. I'm not too ridiculous with money, but I like feeling like I don't have to worry. Like as soon as you don't have to worry about it. Okay, good. Don't think about that anymore. Now think about other things. So it, it really helped me there and also the apostrophe of it was a boundless source of material. We just such a ridiculous show that

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       I hosted a spinoff that didn't get picked up. What was it called? Say uncle her. Her. What's his show too? It wasn't and I was right on the man show and that's how I knew David Horowitz who was producing fear factor and they had a show called say uncle. They try later paranoid in the De Niro movie. I wrote the comedian called like stop uncle or whatever it was. But anyway, the big, one of the big things was a guy, a contestant got in a Turkey pen and we put maple syrup all over when he rolled around in these like birds, like pecked at him. And He, his family's there watching and he starts bleeding and she and I stopped a thing and the producers were mad like, you can't stop in the middle of like the guy's crying. I go and it was just a total disaster.

Speaker 3:          01:21:34       You could tell it was going to be a big hit, but it was risky. And then I remember going to Jimmy Kimmel's like Premiere Party for Jimmy Kim alive. And uh, I saw the head of ABC, they're a. and I'd never done this in my entire life. It was like getting a drink. And I walked over and I said, please don't pick it up. It's rough. It's going to be, it's going to be too hard to stand behind really torturing people. Didn't pick it up, but he just kinda looked at me and smiled. And there's this, this would've been 2003.

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       Yeah, that was right after fear factor was first launched. When, when those shows what happens is you get used to one thing and so you have to do something that's bigger and better than next year. And so when we came back, I felt uncomfortable with a lot of the shit they know how to do it, like these guys are top of the food chain. They. But they were doing some sketchy shit. Like one of them we had these people chained to a tree with a bungee cords that were attached to a helicopter and they had to figure out the right locks to unlock the bungee cord that they're the straps to keep them to the tree. And then as soon as they do, they undo the strap and they go fucking shooting out into space into the center of this giant Canyon and they're bouncing underneath this helicopter.

Speaker 5:          01:22:55       And I remember thinking like, this does it. We could do this a thousand times. One of them, someone's going to die. Of course one of them, someone's going to die and it might be the next one. It never. We got lucky dude. I really feel like we got lucky. I really, really honestly, 100 percent feel like we got lucky. There was a few things. First of all, there's a certain amount of risk that you take whenever you're doing anything like jump your car off of a building roof, which we did. We had people fly cars across a train, a moving train. Okay. There's risk involved in that. Right? But the one that scared the shit out of me the most was bull riding. We had people ride bulls. I was the only time I had told contestants, don't do it. I'm like, if you, if you want to ask me, I would say don't do it on air.

Speaker 5:          01:23:35       No, no, no, no. Before we go on air. I mean I gave them the standard, but when I would talk to them I'd say, look, it's up to you, right? I mean if you want to go on me, people do know how to ride bulls, but you don't know how to ride a bull. We're not teaching you how to ride a bull. You're not going through classes. You don't have to. Slowly but surely building up your techniques. You're just going to go ride a bull. Don't do that. Don't do that. That's what I would say. And we had this girl, she was like 98 pounds. She got launched off the back of this bowl and she'll do this. These people went fucking flying that things kicking fall. Bear. Yeah. Barely misses them when it's kicking. I mean they're wearing helmets and shit. But look at this.

Speaker 5:          01:24:15       Look at this, look at it. I mean, come on man. Look at this. I mean that's, that fall. The way she felt like that. That is like getting hit in the back of the head with the world. Yeah. So like my personal feelings about trauma and about what's dangerous and shit like this. This is a no, no. Especially for a 90 pound woman. Like this poor lady. Oh my goodness. You got up cute little fellow. I was back then. Yeah, she got up, man. She was tough as shit. But everybody. I feel like in that one I feel like we got lucky. I feel like we've rolled the dice because if they stop you, they, they lacerate livers and crushed. Crushed. They can stump you. The funny thing was those stunk. Guys are so fucking tough. Those guys are so used to putting their ass on the line that they don't think anything about someone doing something risky to them. That's what you do. You show up for work and

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       that's definitely a different in your head like Alpha something. Animals have to do that to be a fight, to crave that. Like a wonder what the family's saying. Does it keep them from having a family? There's a wall. Who's going to marry you if you're throwing your life in the line unrelated to war or famine. I think there's a certain allure to remember that TV show. The fall guy. How about evil knievel? Women loved him. Women loved evil knievel. If that's a good point. We may love risk takers. They like bmx, guys that do those flips and shit and those guys or those guys really shit. And now they have the park core guys were there, like climb up a building with no. Any, any, uh, any kind of. So you could smoke. You could do park Parkour on a iron iron grid. Do you exercise at all day? I do the kettlebells, yeah. You were telling me that. I'm still doing that. I can I, you know, because I wanted to ask you this off. The microphone

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       is like I seem to be getting more out of pull ups and, and just regular calisthenics and am out of the, out of the Kettlebell experience. I think it's because like maybe I'm just more into it now, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:26:13       Well there's definitely no better exercise for you then pull ups and push ups. That to me is if I, if somebody had to save for the rest of your life, you gotta pull up bar and no weights. Yeah. You know you're going to be okay. I'd be like, I'll take that over. Not having a pull up bar because I think there's certain amount. There's certain kinds of workouts when you manipulate your own body to pushups. I think too, because you could vary your pushup widths and you could do so many things just with Chin ups and pushups and then with bodyweight, like single leg squats and things like that, you can get a tremendous workout in with just a chin up bar.

Speaker 4:          01:26:46       Yeah. Body weight and then there's something about like that. Do 100 of them, like I can't even do like 10, like 10 would be great for me. But like the guys who can do 100, it's so hard. It's almost like torture to do ups. Chin ups. You can do 100 chin ups is a fucking sap. Yeah. Like I, I, I mean that definitely is the goal.

Speaker 5:          01:27:06       Do. Um, I'll do 100 in two sets. Yeah. I don't do it though. I do sets of 10 and I don't do any more than 10 and I do them multiple times a day. Like I have a chin up bar in my house so I'll walk in and I'll just jump up and do 10, 10 and I've found that like the one thing that's helped my squeeze with Jujitsu and with being able to pick my body and just move around better. It's just, just do them randomly throughout the day. I do chin ups all the time, like whenever, like those bars in the back, I'll do a show here and then I'll go back and do tension.

Speaker 4:          01:27:39       I'm like that with masturbation so I can have sex any time you're ready to go, ready to go. But

Speaker 5:          01:27:45       if I had to pick one thing, it would be that it'd be a chin up bar and then bodyweight stuff, you could do that for sure. That's not into the kettle bells

Speaker 4:          01:27:52       on the, on the road. It's hard to do, you know, like I don't like go into the hotel gym or anything like that. I like to keep it in the room so sometimes you jump rope or something like that. But I would say I've gotten in better shape, but I still feel like, you know, um, you know, crap most of the time. But uh, when I was a kid when I was a kid, like it was all that stuff like pushups and sit ups and all that kind of stuff. And now that I'm back to it, I'm like, you know, I forgot how great this is. You know, it's really cool. You know, what's a great thing for the pull ups afterwards? Those trx things. Oh yes. Now my trainer was

Speaker 5:          01:28:25       to the door of the hotel room and you could do all these crazy exercises and it's real small. You can just tuck it in your bag.

Speaker 4:          01:28:32       I love that. I love the hotel room. Like we've all seen that in the movie, the assassin doing a couple, a couple of very slow pushups.

Speaker 5:          01:28:39       Sometimes if I go down to a gym and there's nothing that I want to do in there, I'll work out my hotel room.

Speaker 4:          01:28:44       You, you never were like a runner. Were you like a run now? But it's only been over the last couple of years really. But even when you were like doing a taekwondo, right? Never had much. I thought that was part of their thing. They had like a military kind of feel to it. Definitely

Speaker 5:          01:28:56       a military feel to it and some, some different. Uh, they would call it Dojo gangs. You know, Jeff's a black

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       bow tie.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       No, we are actually on the show. He pulls out the nunchucks. That's not a part of it, but that's okay.

Speaker 3:          01:29:10       You know, I'm rusty. I have to admit I need to get back to you exercise these days. I've been doing a little bit of Yoga but honestly I've been doing a lot of not exercising lately. Like feel good. Like I'm going a place now where I need to start exercising again. We talked about this in the parking lot the other day. Right. But on a standup hiatus and when I'm not performing I don't care as much about my instrument and I've been editing and writing and producing so I don't know. I've gotten a little not late I guess lazy and I don't feel as good. Like I know I recognize it in my body so I need to snap out of it. I think he needs,

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       it's like a, like a, like a group or like people to hang with because you know, that would make it more fun going out by myself. Yeah. If there was like a. If there was like a group of guys, you know, come on man, don't let us down.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       You could find like a crossfit class to join or some shit like that. I mean they always have those kinds of things. There's all sorts of different classes that you know is awesome. I've done one of those high intensity interval training things at a yoga place to whether you do some yoga and some like really light weights, but all these crazy little exercises. That's fun too. You got a dancer pose. We doing. Let me see me say. Oh, you trying to do that? Don't hurt yourself. Yes. Oh that is that what it's called? Standing bow thing. It's called standing bow and there's this one. Keep it going. What are you going? No one can see you. You're supposed to grab both legs, but that's okay. Do it. Grab that other leg.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       Bet You got it. Nope. This is really do. Come on son. Here he goes. Nice. And the headphones on. Take it to the new level. It's like a NASA mission called again, a cry for help. The crab. So when you, when you say you do yoga, like how often do you do it?

Speaker 3:          01:31:11       What I would go, I would go to hot yoga. You go a couple times a week are now I just kind of do it in my backyard to stretch out after a long flight or something. That's good. Anything kind of like you had the tank like that's a time to think about life. To think through it. Think through a mission that you're working on. Some family issue. It's like quiet. You're. It's about you. For me, Yoga, it's like giving yourself a massage. It's more gratifying than going to glory awaits and stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:31:38       Stretch out before sets. You ever do that? Stretches before you go do set feels real good. There's something about that that's very relaxing. Puts you in a good. I think you carry around. When you're tight, you carry around a lot of tension that you don't necessarily want.

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       Pigeon pose. That's where all the tension is. Pigeon pose. That's the one where your. Where your leg comes under

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       your. I want to ask what the fuck is he doing? Oh Wow. Jeff, that. Oh, I've seen this one. Yeah, I've seen that one. That's called a hip opener. Yeah. Good. Good. That good hips, Bro. It looks so sad. That's one. Like if you go to your yoga, people will do that pose and start crying because there's so much emotion and anxiety release from the hitch. That's not real job. You're just crying because someone tells you you should cry. Sit. Do you want to be a part of this group cry nonsense. They always want to say that this is opening up your colon. You don't have any fucking. There's no diagrams. You don't know where the colon is like, you better stop. You better stop saying that you don't have any fucking. There's tension in the hip. Cat Scans. What's that stuff called? Magnetic residence Mris. You don't have that Brown. You don't have any real evidence. There's emotion. Who should lead a bowl of me?

Speaker 7:          01:32:57       What? I was just thinking about my dad much

Speaker 2:          01:33:01       get the fuck out of here with that shit. You're not. You don't have any memories specifically and people say, no, no, no, but when I'm in that position and they tell you that it's an if emotions come out here, you just let them like what emotions

Speaker 7:          01:33:14       cut out.

Speaker 2:          01:33:17       You've been hypnotized. Someone told you our mission to be emotionally vulnerable. Yes, that that in hypnosis and you don't get that eating lunch at a deli or working out with the boys in the gym. If you're at a quiet, dark yoga place with other people that are staring at their own at the floor, right. You can relax a little emotionally. That's a logical definition. That's a logical way of explaining what's really going on. I'm going to stay. It's just good to hear. Let me ask you a question. Do you eat before you go on stage? No. Me Neither. This guy has to eat like he asked. He eat before he goes on stage like right before, like pretty much right before. I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with eating some fruit right before you go up on stage, but for me, I don't want to.

Speaker 2:          01:34:03       There's a certain amount of resources your body is going to use for digestion. That's just a fact. There's a reason why fighters don't eat a fucking car. You can mash potatoes, right? I hate that fight because your body will be like, fuck you dude. We got to digest this stuff and it sloshed around your stomach. It gets in the way. I hate it. Obviously this. I know plenty of people who have to eat. Sometimes I in that first episode of our show, I eat during the show, I ordered Mozzarella sticks to the stage. That's how hungry I was by the late show. There's nothing wrong with that meant it's not. Not to say that you can't do it and for you you're so casual, like you're probably better off feeling good then you are like being, having more mental alertness. Slightly out. Also like being hungry. Hunger. I liked it. There's annoying. I ate in the car. Coming to your studio today and the first thing I said to Jeff Atlanta, the door, was there anything to eat around here because it's

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       like it's an anxiety thing too, like before you're going to perform and I remember reading years and years and years and years ago that David letterman would eat pineapple right before he went on, so I always ask for pineapple in my writer's. Hi Stacy Pineapples, a good stacy marketing sales. He'd also would do a fasting and then he would pick out. That was his thing. Let him in. That's what I heard, that he would like not eat for like two or three days and then he would do that and that's how my friend Russ does it. Like that kind of thing of like where you like just basically spartan, like nothing. Nothing, nothing. And then like you get to eat whatever you want. I believe for sure that people eat too much food and me included, I eat too much meat

Speaker 5:          01:35:37       and when I, when I fast like especially intermittent fast, I do like 16 hours at night when I do do that. I feel way better. Way Better.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       Wait. What fascinates between dinner and the next time I eat is 16 hours. Jeff, can you imagine that? No. Could you just decide in, do you go to bed? Would have to be getting a colonoscopy or you just look, you eat dinner, you'd done it eight. You go to bed or do whatever the fuck you do, but just know more. How do you. What are you talking about? He can't. Yeah. You have to eat to come on at 10. The last thing I want to do is eat any later than eight. I go right to the cookies in the back of the comedy store. Cookies

Speaker 5:          01:36:20       are different though. That's quick. Carbs. That actually is not a bad idea. I see. That's not a bad idea at all. Like you don't need that stuff to you. I'll eat that stuff. When I was doing this sober October fitness challenge with Ari and Tom Seger and Bert Kreischer, I eat everything in sight. I ate pizza and cookies. I eat everything because it's just one calories, but the problem with cookies and stuff like that, it's like you can eat them, but you just can't make a habit of eating them all the time or will fuck you up. It's just gonna fuck you up. When you go on stage, not a bad idea. Got a little pick me up. Energy, quick carbs. Your body's going to break down those carbs. No Sugar and glucose is a very good fuel for the brain. Really works. Yeah. Yeah. Carbs are good for the brain, especially in like if your body's carb adapted.

Speaker 5:          01:37:05       If you eat carbs all the time and you can eat some carbs right before you go onstage, that'll give you like a little energy. I feel so much better. Even lift. Yeah. Really, like if you wanted to have a cookie or maybe even a snickers bar and then lift weights, I wouldn't. I wouldn't say don't do that. Say that'll give you some fucking sugar to burn off. Like it's not the best food for you in the world, but you're asking for it for a very specific reason. Like after it's over, I'd say yeah, go have some salmon and some vegetables and eat healthy, but right before you want to work out. Like you could drink a coke, like you could drink a coca cola and if you're going to lift for an hour, okay, go ahead. Drink a coke. Who gives a shit. You got to burn that shit off and it's just going to be fueled. That you use is. I wouldn't suggest you do it all the time, but it's not going to have a negative effect on you. It's really a cumulative thing with people in diets. It's eating too much sugar or too much bullshit for too many days in a row and not giving your body a chance to relax.

Speaker 4:          01:37:59       So when I, when I don't eat, I never considered like, oh, that's lightheadedness. I'm like, I'm probably having a stroke. Right? This is it. I should find a place to lay down.

Speaker 2:          01:38:10       I think that's awesome. Well listen, food is fucking phenomenal, right? And you're lucky you live in New York City and then you come to la so you're in both places and you're in two spots that have some of the greatest restaurants on the planet earth. And if you're like a Foodie, Foodie, some cash, Jeff Ross, you can go wherever the fuck you want. I do order a nice bottle of wine and have a fucking beautiful steak with the right accoutrements and you know, why wouldn't you? I mean it's, it's a beautiful pleasure and evaluate a stake. Some red meat fucker fight. It's like I'm either on

Speaker 4:          01:38:51       as soon as I eat a steak and I don't need them as much as I used to, but a lot on the tour. Maybe it was you, me and Monica. That was a great. What was. What were you guys having? They're like a porter house, you know the thing where like not only at the ribs still there, but the hubs like that kind of thing. That really basically like a do it yourself, do it yourself kind of steak bone in real. We really went to. Yeah, we went to town on that. She'd eat more that I love a good steak.

Speaker 5:          01:39:15       I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I think what's wrong with steak? What would people think was wrong with Ron? With red meat is all the stuff you eat with it. All the sugar and bullshit and bread and pasta and then alcohol and sedentary life. There's a bunch of things, but I think if you're a healthy person who exercise all the time, I don't think stakes bad for you at all. I don't even think a little bit. I think it's good for you. I think it's the opposite of bad for you. I think all of our preconceived notions about what's healthy, all of them vary because some people that really don't do good with red meat. Some people don't do well with fish. People have weird,

Speaker 4:          01:39:46       but I don't eat fish. I don't like it either. Do you eat it? Love it. You do that right away, like steps up your whole game, right? That's for sure. It's a lifesaving thing.

Speaker 5:          01:39:55       Well, if you get it, a lot of those essential fatty acids that you can get from like an oily fish, like a salmon, there's. They're so good for you, man. So good at reducing inflammation. Do you take fish oil at all? One of the best things you can take fish oil, Krill oil and anything. Getting those essential fatty acids which so many people are missing from their diet. Just getting a good healthy supply of it everyday. It's just good for everything, man. It's good for your skin. It's good for your brain. Good for muscle development. Oil. Yeah. Official is phenomenal. It's good for inflammation and if you have joint aches and stuff like that, officials have a burger. I feel like I have a booger, you know, how you like touch your nose and it feels moist and you're like, what's happening here?

Speaker 2:          01:40:33       Do you have a cleaner? What's going on here? We're good. I think you're clean. You're good. But officials, just one of the best things, man. So good for you. What does it, what is fish oil? Oil extracted from fish and the fish a little bit of calm. They, they, they excelled. Merge booth at the Joe. So because like David, have you ever

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       caught it? Caught like a what? What is it like a sport? Fish, you know, like a big one or anything like that. And then you would make steaks out of that too. Um, I've done that with the, the most delicious thing I think I caught was a Wahoo other names for it. So we're,

Speaker 5:          01:41:09       we caught in Hawaii. It was phenomenal man, because big we brought it. We were staying at a hotel and we brought it to the, uh, the waiter or the chef in the hotel would cook stuff for you and you would just bring them to the, uh, the fish and, you know, he would go, how do you guys think, do you want to prepare this? And so we said, I don't know, like, what do you think? It's like, what would you do if somebody brought you this? He goes, I would prepare a bunch of different ways because there's a huge fish so I can make you guys a little bit of [inaudible], a little bit of Sushi. My perfect. So it was, he cooked it six hours after it was dead. I mean we caught it and then six hours later we're eating it for lunch. It was insane. It was so good. That is cool. Oh, that's it right there. Wow. That's what it looks like. There's another name for it. And the Hawaii, they call it an oh no. Oh no, that's right. That's right. It's still licious. It's so good

Speaker 1:          01:41:56       fishes looking at the camera too. Oh wait, that's crazy. But yeah, it's. You like fishing over hunting? No, fishing is harder. I like them. Both you do

Speaker 5:          01:42:09       is way more intense and I feel way worse for the animal. Like I don't feel bad for them.

Speaker 1:          01:42:15       Fish. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 5:          01:42:17       For whatever reason, I'm just being honest, like if I catch a big salmon and I'm like, sorry dude, right, but this is what I'm here for. Like, but when I shoot a deer, um, there's always a little part of me and it's like, oh, you know, this is what I, you know, I eat and I know that if I don't do this, they're going to die of starvation or disease or they're going to be ripped apart. Asshole first by coyotes. Like this is not a good end for them no matter what. And me shooting them, it's probably the best end they're ever going to get all those justifications aside. It's a different feeling when you see like an elk down. Then when I catch a salmon salmon, it's 100 percent happiness.

Speaker 1:          01:42:56       But what about when you pull the trigger? I'm seeing the animal downs one thing, but what about knowing it's coming? It's hard to keep your shit together. That's a hunter. That's the hunting. You get emotional.

Speaker 5:          01:43:07       No, you don't. You get nervous. You don't want to fuck it up. You don't want to injure anything. So there's a lot of anticipation in that moment. It's sort of, it's very intense and uh, whatever amount of meat you get from that animal, whenever you eat it, you're going to think about that moment. You think about that moment. Every time I eat, let slip while you think about it. Like this is, this was a intense life or death moment in life, like this circle of life chain moment in life that I participated in it and now I'm eating it so I know exactly what the food is as opposed to going to Morton's get a nice steak and mashed potatoes. I don't know where the fuck they grew that potato.

Speaker 1:          01:43:47       I get that feeling when I opened the can of pringles went on Monday when I'm in the

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       refrigerator. Creamsicles do you think, do you like fishing at all? I used to fish as a kid and the Hudson River with my grandfather. We would catch bass and I really loved it. I haven't done it since I was a kid. Really. It's fun. It's a fun thing to do. It's a passion. Yeah. With just if you could find like if you're doing a gig and you could find a spot that has like a party boat especially, and they. They'll take out and everybody dunks a line and people pulling fish left and right. Nobody's laughing and people drinking beers. It's fucking fun, man. It's fun. Yeah, but that was a big thing in New England. We do party boats for bluefish and just go to a spot and everybody dropped their line and they'd be pulling these fish up and then, you know, you cook them later that night.

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       It's fantastic. Wow. Just makes you think about what a fish is too and how weird it is. We got this alien world connected to us. We pull these things out, cut their fucking heads off and cook them up. Well, you've been to Japan and all those places. I've been to Japan, but I fucked up when I was there and I didn't go to the fish market. The fish market in Tokyo is one of those like a million fish. We don't even know about that. They liked it. It's crazy, but it's so, so interesting to see like, you know, we're so used to, like you said, bread and all that stuff. It's like, you know, is it a meal without bread? It's like these people like go months without seeing a piece of bread. Yeah. They're not in the bread and they're all thin. Yeah. It's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:45:15       They're their noodles. A lot of times they're rice noodles. It's very different. You know, there's wheat noodles there too though, right? They just, they eat different than us. They have a completely different style of eating in just. It's one of the coolest things about Tokyo man, is that it's almost like an alternative country. It's, Oh, you mean this city because it's so different. Like say if you're in Los Angeles, right? You'll leave from Los Angeles and you know you're here in 2018 and you drive it around. This is the way people live over here and this is how people were in traffic and this is how people are when they come to the comedy store, all these different places, and then you go to Tokyo, you go, oh, wow. Is also people in 2018 to live in at the exact same time, but they're doing it totally differently.

Speaker 2:          01:45:57       Like everybody's super polite as you walked on the street. There's no people bumping into anybody. Nobody's yelling at anybody. They're very polite, but they're also very Japanese, right? The majority of people you see are Japanese homogeneous, lightly integrated, right? I mean, there's some, you see some Africans there. See some people like us there, but it's mostly Japanese people. It's, uh, it's interesting to see it. Have you seen this TV show on Amazon called the man in the high castle now? What is it? It's a future. It's basically America. If the Nazis won the war and they partner with the Japanese and the Japanese owned California, Northern California, and the Nazis on the rest of the country and the Midwest, sort of a no man's land. So New York is Nazi, New York. They split it up. The but, but Japanese. Whoa. It's third season

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       and I'm obsessed with it. Philip Dick is the, uh, is the PSI writer. So he's classic. It's one of his books. He's the mayor, he's gracious guy. That guy has been in a lot of stuff, was really good.

Speaker 2:          01:47:01       What is his name? I forgot it. The actor's name, Rufus Rufus. See? Well, is that I say it. Yeah, it's really good looking place. The governor of New York. Let's see, food for the Arbor group in proofers. The governor of New York pure is the governor of New York. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:47:20       But it's a very interesting show. Basically New York cops wearing Nazi armband. So there's still New York cops like, hey, the furious says I got give you a ticket. You know, it's like that. And it's fascinating how they do the show. But what's interesting about Japanese culture and the show is you see the, the, the, the fancy class, the, the, the, the aristocratic class of Japanese of Japan, uh, runs essentially, um, San Francisco. And you see how they're very snobby and

Speaker 2:          01:47:50       particular in and they don't really like to mix with the Americans. Wow. With the Anglos. It's fascinating. Really.

Speaker 6:          01:48:00       That Guy Philip k, Dick, you know, am I saying his name right? He really is. He's really a, he's really super cool. Like in terms of the Scifi stuff and um, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:48:10       what else has he written? I've, I've seen there was another movie that I saw his, like within the last two years. Could you, could you bring up his, uh, his books because I would know what other movies that you do or did they, do they adapt of his movies? What do we got here? So this guy wrote that show scanner darkly. Wow. That's right. Damn. He wrote a lot of shit. The adjustment team. Isn't that a movie, Tim? That's bureau. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, the art direction is really cool. The idea of not so fine America. You know what's interesting too is you can still do that in a movie where you can still play Nazis as long as they're, you know, the bad people and some historical thing or some something that's going on now. That's really the only way you could portray Nazis. Like you're not allowed to be a Nazi for Halloween. Sorry. Right. Like people have said like people have tried it and you get called out for it. Like there's rules now. You can't be

Speaker 6:          01:49:21       get on that show. What are your. What did your kids go for Halloween? Did they, do they do that or do they even.

Speaker 2:          01:49:27       It was very adorable. They were Mermaids, but when you're, if you're dressing up for Halloween, you could be so many terrible things. He could be vampires and werewolves and demons and everybody's. Okay, cool. Cool. I went to a plastic straw. Kingus Khan. You can be kingus Khan. Can't be Hitler.

Speaker 6:          01:49:45       It could be Saddam Hussein and people will laugh if yes, sit down was saying we got them, we got that guy. But if you dress Mengele, you've ruined the party. You dress as Osama bin Laden. That might get your ass kicked, you might get your ass kicked for that one or that was too soon, but if you dress like you could probably dress like a. The president of Iran. What's that dude's name? That dude came over here and set a bunch of crazy shit. Gay People Boucher, Boucher, blah, blah, blah. No, I'm talking about. Let's just talk about it for a second. I remember when people were offended that there was an Anne Frank Halloween costume. Now if the point of talking about the Holocaust or something like that is never forget and a 14 year old in a non mocking way wants to embody and frank, why is that offensive? I don't understand that, but they're never going to do it.

Speaker 6:          01:50:38       Non Mocking. Right? Every time you're making a halloween costume, you're almost always trying to be silly. Right? Frank? He's hiding in the attic. Halloween Halloweena cost, but I don't know. It all depends on, to me, your intentions. One hundred percent. You should be able to wear whatever the fuck you want. I never understood when that Prince Harry got all this shit for dressing like a Nazi. It was like, I don't know, maybe wait, did he dress, like announcing he was dressed for, it was a costume party to veterans. So like what, what would you do? Why would you do that? You know, because it doesn't mean he's glorifying it, does it? I guess if he's the prince, right. But you could be a Mongol, you can be one of the Mongol hoards tour through Europe, but he's also a symbol unto itself. He's assemble the English royalty and all that kind of, I guess because it's hundreds of thousands of years later.

Speaker 6:          01:51:29       But he grew up all right. He got out of it that motherfuckers living under a microscope though when he can get away with, but pretty much no one can get away with being a Nazi anymore. There was a guy from North Carolina or something like that recently. Him and his son were Nazis for, for Halloween. One person that could get away with it and I can't say too much because we haven't released it yet. But uh, Gilbert godfried so he can get. I know it. If you're a Jew you can get away with it. Yeah. Yeah. You can, yeah. Everybody's, everybody's, you know, everyone seems to. Yes. Go ahead and put your right. I mean remember when she did that? She dresses a Nazi. Yeah. I always think that stuff's funny. When I was a 13 year old kid and he was school or grade school, learning about the first amendment, this, one of the reasons I became a comedian was because I used to just draw swastikas on my notebooks just because, just because I knew I was like, they would teach us about dictatorships, so I would go, wow. So in any other country they can't do this and I would just do it, make myself smile and then cross it out and I go in any other country, I'd get my tongue cut out. I go, that's the beautiful thing is that you can say fucked up terrible. You can dress like an asshole. Like bad taste is not a crime. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       Yeah. And that was what one of the, you remember the Yale uprising a couple of years back, there was a guy, I'm Nicholas Greek name and his wife, they were at Yale and the wife sent out an email saying that we need to stop policing people's costumes. It's Halloween costume. She got fired and you can have a politically incorrect ca halloween costume like we should relax. And people started freaking out. They cornered him in the square or screaming and nick, here it is, Chris Christakis, Christakis, I don't wanna fuck up. So Nicholas Christakis. So uh, he's a Greek American sociologist and a physician and he was teaching at Yale and these kids were, they confronted them and they were screaming at him like, this is our safe place. You fucking ruined our play. It was so bizarre and strange and hostile. And he was just trapped out there with these nonsensical kids screaming at him that he's racist and this whole thing is racist and he shouldn't be able to wear whatever costume you want. Like no one even specified like what we're talking about.

Speaker 4:          01:53:56       It was, it was ethnic costumes that they, that's supposed to appropriate another culture. Even even though like, you know, it's just for the party. I got Adam and people are just looking for a reason to be upset. It doesn't have to make any sense. But, but the whole idea of like this thing, this woke a thing like my niece and my niece and nephew are going to call, you know they're going to get ready to go to college and I'm like Oh God, this is going to be so difficult, you know, because they're going to come out of this machine, you know, pretty much looking at me as like, you know, pretty much I'm already not that relevant but like just like all of my references and stuff like that and just going to be so you know, inappropriate. And it's like when you go to college it's supposed to go to the open your mind not to really focus your opinion that you already have.

Speaker 4:          01:54:42       So that's what I felt was like, I felt like everybody's like, I don't want to play college show and we're all dreading the day when we have to play a show like that where, you know, everybody there has that group think, you know, you have to adapt and you do a dot. I know, you know, I'm hoping to tap tap fine, but I'm just saying like playing a college and now you probably could do it, but I don't think I could. Of course she could. Uh, yeah. You adapt in terms of doing a set. You can, you hate yourself, that ride home, you won't want to do that. What you'd want to just be able to do whatever you want to do and it would make you want to do it. So, so you're not gonna go push it. Not Offensive or mean. Yeah. You're not a bad person.

Speaker 4:          01:55:20       So they don't take that into account. It's the words coming out of your mouth. They taking them literally. That's why we're in this state, that we're in that. Exactly. That's what I'm saying. I'll see the irony or the sarcasm in that. The sense of humor in this country has never been lower and I can say that as like what Jeff's talking about, like when we were little kids like blazing saddles and a young Frankenstein, these movies that everybody was watching them enjoying them and stuff like that. Now they have all these hidden and people look

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       into that and I'm like, you know, it was just a fun time. It was just like a fun experience. It was. It wasn't like that was like the template for how to live. You can bounce back, but I think what's happening now is there's a certain number of people that want to be able to change the way other people talk and what they talk about because they are ultra sensitive so they have this giant reaction to things that may or may not be relevant and it's a debate whether or not it's relevant. Some things we've changed, right? Like certain words that used to be able to say easily just a few years ago, way hard to get away with saying now because the culture is shifting in a way that's becoming more sensitive. So probably that's good as long as they understand context and intent context and Mel Brooks, because he used the n word 50 times in a movie.

Speaker 2:          01:56:32       Of course not. Of course not. It's a different time. When my uncle Murray said, you know, I brought, when I brought a Chinese girlfriend home to my pop jack and he's like, east is east and West is west and never the two shall meet. We didn't kick my grandfather out of the family. We just said character mine into Congress. Listen, guy grew up like we're watching. We're that guy grew up in world war two. Of course. I mean that this no one could ever. There's no way we're going to understand that. The difference in the way people saw the world that had to deal with an actual world war two, this soft pampered ass life we're living. I don't condone racism, but I understand why people hold grudges. Right? If you went over to Vietnam and lost half your fucking friends and you came back over here and you're fucked up still because of it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:23       I don't condone racism, but I think that anytime you're forced into a situation where your country is at war with another side, it's probably really hard for people to forgive people. Right. You know? I mean, how. How hard is it? That was one of the things that someone said about the Japanese and not really too thrilled with Americans and I said, well, how? How do you think you'd feel if you were showing up 40 years after someone had literally nuked your country twice, just annihilated hundreds of thousands of people with one bomb. I mean, mean, made shadows on the concrete of where someone's body used to be. Just vaporize them. Women, children, babies, grandma, grandpa, everybody gets it. Boom. I mean, who the fuck is going to be nice after that? It takes a long time to forget that shit. Who is that baseball? The Japanese baseball guy. How are you? Oh yeah. That got to negotiate that into the contract and you've got to give me a little extra for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Reparation little things. They did it twice. America doesn't give itself enough shit for having the interment camps here. I had been on one of those. There's one up on a Washington state on Bainbridge island, right? There's one on Bainbridge island. Really? Bainbridge is beautiful. I can't believe you to determine camp there, doesn't Jesus? We're not all and we got into that

Speaker 6:          01:58:41       war late, man. We don't give ourselves enough shit for that either.

Speaker 5:          01:58:46       Yeah. Does it once in. I'm the guy from Star Trek. Yeah, isn't, wasn't he? It was his name.

Speaker 6:          01:58:54       George George. George Guy. He's a survivor. He lived in a Japanese internment camp. It was a little kid and for FDR was president for four terms. Isn't it crazy? What's he really president for four term? He died in a year and it was fourth term. How can you share about that? Was it for three? But it definitely was more than three and then he got elected and they stopped after that. They will like. It can only be two, but I bet you that are going to.

Speaker 5:          01:59:18       Yeah. That's amazing. If you had a great president though, like I want to keep doing this job. Did that awesome. CEO of Google, like kicking ass. Now you got to step it down, Bro. Only eight years, right? It's like the only gig where when you're really. It has so much power. Really. You just can't keep running this. You got to give up the reins. Like everybody has to give up the reins. We'd never let the best person to run it forever. You would think once Clinton got ahead of steam under him, you know, just feed is carnal desires and just

Speaker 6:          01:59:53       quarterback. You know, you're only gonna have a few good years. Seasons.

Speaker 5:          01:59:57       Right? But how many years do you think the public would have kept him in? Like say if you had a guy like Barack Obama, how many years, if they just let them go until he doesn't want to do it anymore, until we don't want them to do it anymore. How many years you think you keep doing it? Man, he might be able to do it for four or five terms maybe more easily. Especially if it showed that his policies were working. Because you know a lot of these policies, economic policies, they take years in order to see real world benefits.

Speaker 6:          02:00:23       Look, if you take the actual campaigning out of it, you know, they're really only president for two years because it's like they're campaigning on the way in and then the campaigning on the way out and it's like, you know, that's for all of our government and like we're all like I guess victims of that so sad, but calender,

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       trying to explain it the other day about the amount of time that a congressman or senator or any politician spends raising money versus the amount of time that they spend actually doing their job. It's like it's not even close

Speaker 6:          02:00:50       and it's so humbling that their job is awesome. We see them on cspan banging a gavel and making a point and handing out a metal to a soldier and then you go see an actual political fundraiser and it's like boring. It's like cory booker standing on a basement floor at canter's on a Sunday morning and there's no glamor to it at all. Now. They have the worst gig ever. If I took you to, if we were, the three of us had to show up where politicians have to show up to raise money. You'd be screaming at your age and going, are you fucking kidding me with this microphone? And there's no. There's no lights and no one could hear me and I'm fucking talking to a wall. There's no food. Wouldn't starve. That's like the worst. That is a could see why anybody would do this fricken job of, of trying to. I'm going to try to help people. Fuck you. We're going to expose. You are going to beat you up. We're going to go at all your busy, you know. But trump was the only one that did it with a built in giant audience right from the jump. Like right from the jump. He had a giant audience going crazy tours on our dime. If Hillary right now, real housewives instead of the Senate, she would've been president. She had just feed. You mentioned seeing Hillary bill around the house.

Speaker 6:          02:02:15       Famous for just being a lady sort of being a politician. That's true. She probably would have and in some ways, right? She was almost like hindered by the fact that she was Bill Clinton's wife. If she was just a, a senator by herself with a lawyer who became a senator, she probably would have way more of a shot of winning. Same Person. Right? People always say, you know, what did bill, what did trump do for the working man? He entertained them. Like show is great. People love that show. It's true. Don't you click on the stories first? You don't go to, you know, you're not reading about the, the, the genocide in Rwanda. You're, you're reading the trump, like accidentally spelled something wrong. Right? From top news story. That's our. Yeah. Lately there's all these new charges have been brought up that I didn't know about and new people are getting arraigned and it's like, it's a crazy. It's like watching a crazy separate. We have very short attention

Speaker 4:          02:03:16       that man in this country and like we, we expect results, you know? And that's why in the new cycle the way it is now, it's like, you know, you. Have you ever been in a hotel where you'll watch, like for some reason you're caught in like the three or four hour news cycle where you see the same story, whatever, and then there's like one more detail and then they'll start it up again and you're like, wow, you know, I'm going to get a phone call because now I could be a panelist. I know everything, you know, like we figured it out. He was wearing shoes, but I still watch TV news shows though online. Dave knows every show I love. I love, I like the um, I, I liked watching the whole day cycle, you know, like I, I just think it's, especially when it's something like an event that's happening and you get to see, you know, them figuring it out because they can't wait for, to know this whole story now because he has to be immediate. So you get, you get to see them, like started, you know, and it's like, it's really like, it's like going to journalism school almost, you know, like, okay, something bad happened here. And then like they're working on their bits. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 6:          02:04:21       They have to introduce them like right where breaking news, breaking news. We'd been told they don't know exactly what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 4:          02:04:28       That's definitely like, you know, my mom, she has some memory issues and stuff like that, but like waiting till 6:00 to find out what happened in the world, you know, like that's those days over. Can you imagine if

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       we did that? Like that's a new rule, you know, those days are over like a guy. I remember when the. I'm like, how did we get through the whole day? Right. How did we get to the door? I remember when the challenger blew up, what they used to do back in the day, they would interrupt. Yes. And that was exciting. Yes. Big.

Speaker 6:          02:04:54       We have some terrible news and the world of entertainment. We have to pause the game. Just to Howard. I was sitting on the bed with my dad watching Monday night football and cosell just changes mood. All of a sudden the music, Beatles legend John Lennon and I thought he said John, Jack Lemon, you know, John Lennon was assassinated outside his apartment. And that's like, yeah. You remember broadcasting Howard cosell announcing something or when the moon launch took off. There's no moment now where you're like, oh, I remember a certain members, certain broadcast are announcing a certain thing.

Speaker 2:          02:05:35       No, no. You hear one version of it. Then you hear so many versions of it. You forget which one you heard first. Like I remember when I saw that fell when I saw it the first time I saw it on television. I didn't know. I don't know who said it. I don't know who was giving the news cast. It didn't, doesn't even register. Just have to. You just have to be believable.

Speaker 4:          02:05:54       That was. Yeah, that was definitely a local news moment because I was in New York and my mom goes, turn on the TV and then we could see the coverage right there. So was like, that was before the web where you could go like, okay, I'm going to get deeper into this. It was like waiting on the next bit of information.

Speaker 6:          02:06:10       So I was, I was laying in bed in New York and I found out from the great newscaster, Ralphie May, who was

Speaker 2:          02:06:17       screaming into my Edward,

Speaker 6:          02:06:23       he knew I was flying out of New York that day and he had, he had, he was in la and he's trying to, he's like Toronto and it was just him yelling to my answering machine. It was like entered my dream and I kinda heard sirens in the back of my dream cars. They'll look ambulances running down Broadway and I turned it on just to see the second tower fall down. And Ralphie, he was my Walter Cronkite, Ralphie, ms dot that guy.

Speaker 4:          02:06:48       We lost a lot of good ones this year. Sean rouse? Yes. Do you know Joe is a great opener of mine. He was so funny, man. Great Guy. I only saw them in weird places with Dave. Like guys, we're pals. Yeah, he was really good. And um, you know, right out of Texas and uh, he was such a good guy. He was out of the Houston area, Houston. He was such a good,

Speaker 2:          02:07:13       a lot of that old laptop in river oaks. There was a lot of great comics. Those local guys, they had quality local comics like you would, you would do a set there and the guys would open for you. You'd be like, Holy Shit, you guys are funny.

Speaker 4:          02:07:27       And do you remember like the whole myth of the Texas outlaws? Like I used to eat that up. I was like, tell me another story. I want to hear another story that was Hixon Kennison

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       really low. And, and, uh, Jimmy Pineapple, the pineapple. I worked with Jimmy Pineapple first time I ever did that club there. Great Guy. Funny Dude too. Yeah, those guys like Jefferson, Jimmy, Joe. I never thought it could be pineapple. I don't think I even heard of him until funny dude. He was one of the outlaws. Early outlaws will shoot Schubert. Schubert used to go on the road with them too. You know, Marin Marin was one of the guys that was with them in town. I didn't know that. I to become one of the Texas comedy outlaw. How deep it was. Like a group of these wild comics down in area. There was Jimmy Pineapple looking guy. Gloria, small springish on microphone. Funny Dude though. I don't want to put in new stuff out there. Get a good guy though too. I've worked with them. Was Really Nice. James sign up. That was when I first worked at club.

Speaker 6:          02:08:25       I love that club. That was one of the greatest rooms of all time, man. I did my, uh, warner brothers cd there in 1999. Wow. Yeah. That fucking club was so hot. It was packed. Tight ceiling. Wild motherfuckers, Texas people. Wild Texas Pete. Just chaos. Drinking good times. Fun. Nice. People that are smart, but they're also like to get fucked up. Absolutely. You in Texas this weekend? I don't know where I am yet. You don't know where you. I'm waiting to hear on my schedule because you have a phone. Exactly. Yeah. It's buffering. But I actually took dave to a phone store. Yeah. You know, we were preparing for the tapings and he never texted me back and I'm like, we're walking by this and I'm like, just come in and look. And he literally looks at the iphone like it's the enemy of the people.

Speaker 6:          02:09:16       It's the stain. You have an iphone also. I got the guy goes, you could do anything on this. You could text, you can make a point, you could do anything, you can record your shows. And Dave goes, should we really play? God? I had a couple of good lines, but uh, I don't go past an iphone too. I feel like, you know, that's pushing it because now it's like up to 10, right? You have an iphone too, like, yeah. How many are, how many articles compared to Jv burst? How many iphones compared to how many rocky movies are there?

Speaker 6:          02:09:50       Rocky movies are there now. [inaudible] name is Hobie rockies because now we have d dos creeds. The second thing act now, like I say it is because it's working off of the actual narrative of rocky. Do you hear Michael b? Jordan is talking about boxing. Roy Jones Jr. Yeah. I thought that was a cool kind of hope. It's a joke. Just straight up boxing and not like a meu moitai. Listen, don't do that michael. Just don't do that. I'm sure he's a great athlete. He's a beautiful kid. Has got a great bodY. It looks like he knows how to box when he throws punches. It looks like you really actually knows how to box. I'm sure he's a really good athlete and it's built like a brick shithouse, but boxing. Roy jones jr is a pastor. Someone that had to get hit upside. You'll never work again or you'll become a box. Yeah. You hang in there with them and you

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       look like your hero. Me. You clip them and hurt him. I mean it is. It is a humanly possible thing, right? Like when two people throwing punches at each other that one of them could hit the other guy, but the downside is ruined. Boy jones is one of the greatest boxers of all time and still to this day knows how to box. it's not like he forgot he's pushing 50, 49. Yeah, he's pushing 50. If you think somebody, someone who's like deal with it. I think it was just talking shit. He was just probably being asked like who would you like to box? Who is your hero and how many rounds to go certain amount. What exactly happened? He said he would. He asked them, who would you want to fight today? And he said, Roy Jones, he would probably beat me in his prime, but I'd probably find them today.

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       It's probably just like that is an outrageous thing to say. Just an asshole thing to say. George foreman. Listen, he probably would kill you in his prime when the idea that he would just beat you mean Roy Jones jr. When he was in his prime, you would Just waiting to see. He was a nas song. they said Roy Jones is in the new mike tyson's Roy Jones. It's in. This is like in the 19 nineties. People forgot how good Roy Jones jr was. He was putting his hands behind his back and then knocking people out. He was doing ridiculous shit. Knocked out light heavyweight champion. Virgil hit with a body shot to hear it so we can hear the context. Okay, sure. Let's listen to it.

Speaker 8:          02:12:00       I heard that you, after all your training for the creed, you can hold your own in a fight thing a little bit. You know what? I've been working out with rocky, but we're going out with like, you know, saying like apollo creed. I'M going to go up. Absolutely. So now who all time would you want to step into the rooM with? But there's a boxer, a wrestler by Roy Jones, bro. That's my dude. I can do my thing a little bit. Yeah, that whoLe monthly. Right now it's prime now. Hip hop. It knocked my esl, but like right now I can do one thing.

Speaker 2:          02:12:28       Why answer that question? He was a show where you funnier than george carlin and his prime. Can you just answer that right now? Since he did? I know you've had a few drinks and the restaurant and take some right now. I'm on coke. Coke. Let me answer some questions. Roy jones jr said he was trading with rocky. That was the best part. And apollo creed, you know their names and he doesn't know that old dude. The old dude, the black guy, the black guy. Black panther too. He's awesoMe. Plays a good superhero. He's a great guy. I love his movies. He was a good bad guy in that movie. But you know, it's like, just shouldn't answer that just made a mistake, you know, young, cocky, full life. Look, everything's going well now. and again, built like a goddamn superhero. Probably thinks he could box the world. There's Just a different thing that's going to be happening if you're standing in front of Roy Jones jr, it's a different thing. He's, yeah, he's got a computer that's many, many times more robust

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       than yours when it comes to box, it's just taking the punishment. It's not like, you know, it's like, okay, that's enough. It gives you a concussion and you never act again. What's the upside for? You can tee up on the way a 50 year old boxer. It looks at this actor, pretty boy. And it's like, uh, when they bought that, when they broke, um, what's his name? Out of the box and pulp fiction.

Speaker 5:          02:13:52       Yeah. I mean he's jack though. Look at them to them seriously. But see, the thing is like, there's such a giant difference between learning how to box and being a good athlete. He clearly is. And being Roy Jones jr, the, the gap is so wide. It's so, it's like if I did a movie about playing basketball and then I wanted to, you know, play a one on one versus coby. Brian, you'll have been planning this movie for a couple of.

Speaker 6:          02:14:21       I'm feeling good even though I never did any competitive basketball player. You were in the white shadow. It's like He got beat up. It's like he's, he's a movie star brown. He's got fake blood on his whelks that was in the movie.

Speaker 5:          02:14:33       I'm sure he knows how to throw his hands. I'm sure he does. He looks good in the movies. He looks like he really knows what he's doing. but Roy Jones jr is one of the greatest of all time. He was a female. He knows how to box in a way that you never going to understand. So how long has he been simply boxed? Ten years. I mean Roy Jones had a fight within the last two years. I think his last fight was, I wanna say it was two less than two years ago. I think he retired. He had a bunch of fights over in Russia. He actually became a russian citizen. Is that it? This year? Jesus christ place some of it. Play. He's a retired boxer. Challenging a box. Fucking Roy Jones jr. All right. Just this is a different thing. It's one thing if you're like a top level pro right now and you feel like you would have got knocked out by ryan is probably, but you can give them a goal right now. Okay. that I. That is. That's believable. You're a professional boxer. You've been honing your craft in the gym for years and years. You've been sparring and work with high level coaches. Look at him. He's still Roy Jones jr. Still Roy Jones jr. Even though he's 40, it doesn't matter if he's boxing one's a boxer, but Roy Jones is in a boxing match here and he's looking good. I mean, he's obviously not fighting a guy who's the best.

Speaker 6:          02:15:54       Roy jones jr. Do you call your your agent right now? Serious. What's the money? He's already been doing all these interviews. Just said, look, I don't want to get out of bed early in the morning, but if you know, if he wants to really do this, we could do this. I think it'd be a wonderful opportunity to show people what boxing is. Oh, let me see what he said. I would love to see that here. Let's see what roy says. Of course I saw the video. Birthing is a duct to fight in my life. NothIng right now. Hurricane to come down here so ain't nobody real content

Speaker 9:          02:16:31       and we will make happen. You got my number. He can cut you and get my number. So there's no question about high. No. From tmc. The list may happen

Speaker 10:         02:16:44       right now. He said in the video, he said, I think he would probably have killed me back in his prime. That's true though. Do you actually many kids beat you now even though you are 49 boy.

Speaker 9:          02:16:58       No, you can't beat me still because I mean I know he's probably a better condition because he's younger. He probably think he can go longer and probably thinks he might be able to even at working now, but I'm a bit old. School ain't going out like that to me. I love you. Understand me. So opened unstable box. We'll just take them out right away because then you don't get the experience with box. I'm a professional like I am, and I know you big and strong because you've got strong for the movie. Then I should be able to avoid all of that. Take them into deep water so you understand what a boxing match release comes out. He don't want to say, oh, I've got. No, no, no, no, no. I'm a nice five, six rounds. So I want you to see how it really feels. So that's why I'm talking like that now because I think he can really match my skills. I really don't even that for tonight.

Speaker 10:         02:17:48       How long would you need to get right to where you could step in there? Like, what's the soonest we could make this fight happen?

Speaker 9:          02:17:54       Uh, probably for him about four or five weeks.

Speaker 2:          02:18:02       Michael, please listen to me. Don't do this. Someone called stubhub. Just don't do this, do this. This is not gonna work out well, especially if they're, I would assume both of them are not going to be drug tested. I don't think either one of them wants to pee in a bucket. If they just let roy, they let roy go to dr feelgood, pump them up with hormones. This is going to be a route. This would be terrifying. I imagine getting a call from his agent, hey, we have an offer for you to do this, like new superhero movie. It's gonna be amazing, and michael is like, ah, I'm booked that whole five weeks, five weeks. I got to train for Roy Jones jr, like, don't do it, but this is a new genre of tv show of the real guy versus the guy playing. Want to see doctors against guys who played a dr alessi astronauts against guys who was picked or an astronaut. I want to see it all. Navy seals, navy dinosaur versus chicken. I want to say it. Isn't that what mark walberg side, if he was on the plane with five versus city, did he really say that though? That's what everybody says. I never heard him say the things. Think a crazy thing.

Speaker 5:          02:19:09       Thank you. Know who knows what the fuck you would do if you thought that you were just going to land somewhere. Now that's the idea is that you knew what was gonna happen before it happened. Nobody knows about. Well, that shit's going down. Someone's got box cutters. They were holding the waitress. They're holding a stewardess by the neck, like you know, you don't know what fuck's happening. You have no idea what's going on. You're afraid to move and you know, I'm sure that a lot of people would step up, but you know, it could potentially cost that person in their life and then when the plane lands, that person's dead when they may be. If you don't know, right? You don't know the actual scenario. Now obviously we know was a horrible thing and you should do whatever you can to stop them because they're going to kill everybody no matter what.

Speaker 5:          02:19:51       But back then you didn't know what I mean. If someone just took the plane and landed in the stewardess, he would be like, glad I didn't do anything. She jumped up and he cut her face off. You know, it's like in those moments when you don't know what's going to happen to. I was on that plane. Okay. With my kids, the window went down like it did. That would have been a lot of blood in that first class cabin. Then me saying, okay, we're going to land somewhere safely. Don't worry. Know that. See I, I see where he's coming from. Right? He's got a. He's got kids that he loves. He's got a family that he loves. He wouldn't have said still. That's what he's saying. Yeah. That's what you're saying. And then in his mind he probably has that conviction. Even if it meant the thing that winning everybody's life, would you know, would it work if it didn't work?

Speaker 5:          02:20:40       Like what do they have? Do you know what they have? You know, they don't know. You don't have a box cutter. They have anything else? How many of them are there? You don't know. Is anybody going to back you up? Does anybody else know how to fight? You know, you could get fucked up. You could. You could step up thinking you'Re billy bad ass and this guy is some train the trainers who smashes your face in and cuts you up with a box cutter that could happen to. It still pulls his belt off the planet. You could. Who the fuck knows matt the. That's why there's professionals, right? That's where there's professional. Those air marshals can assess the situation and figure out and obviously, you know, they weren't either they weren't there on that plane or they couldn't help.

Speaker 6:          02:21:19       I was thinking about if I was in that position, I'd, you know, how could you. I mean, who the fuck knows what you would do? Well, since I look like I'm on the other team, I would've said my friends. Fuck, come on, get up and do your. I'm like, I'm not part of the team. Do your foreign guy. Fuck man. Yeah. You'd be, you know, I've never been so scared that you're frozen instance for a second.

Speaker 5:          02:21:50       Oh yeah, yeah. I mean you, you can't know what the right thing to do is in the wrong thing. Could be so catastrophic. Right.

Speaker 6:          02:22:00       As far as to say that he's making announcements on the plane and this is all happening like brittle landing safe, like he's now the pilot in the movies, right? That's true movie. You get to grant the intercom at the end and go, thanks for flying solo and solera.

Speaker 5:          02:22:17       Sometimes you say things like that because that's how you feel and you don't think about how other people are going to perceive it. That's what I would assume that statement is. It's kind of how he felt like, fuck that. I'm landing this fucking plane. I'm killing the fucking terrorists. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:22:28       that's what he told his kids one night.

Speaker 5:          02:22:30       The problem is you're saying that to billions of people and billions of people hear that and they go, what? And then all these people get to assess your. Your statement whether or not it has any makes any sense. Like what are you going to do? You can kick everybody's ass. Okay, sure. I know a lot of dudes who, if they were there and you try to do that, you'd get smashed. Like they're scary people in this world than weapons on him. I would assume. If you're ready to die like that, you have a very strange kind of conviction to if you know you're ready to die and you know how to fight like woo Jesus. I don't mean who knows, but it's

Speaker 11:         02:23:09       Just

Speaker 5:          02:23:11       the idea that you would have to think about it. That's what's really terrifying. What do you mean? The idea that you would have to think like, what do I do if something is someone does. Hi,

Speaker 6:          02:23:19       don't we all think that? Yeah. Every, every situation now there's what we do do. Do.

Speaker 5:          02:23:26       Do you hear people run and they survive and people run and get shot down and they go to the wrong way. Anytime a tragedy like that happen, like what the fuck? Horrific random Set of sequences and you're in the wrong spot.

Speaker 6:          02:23:42       You can do the right. Heroic. How about how many people must do the heroic thing and then you die anyway. You never know about it. Oh, for sure. I wonder what uncle steve did in that situation. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       Wow. Yeah. That's a lot of. It seems like those fucking things are happening more and more lately. It is. Is the rate more accelerated now than it's ever been before, as well as the numbers of these shootings and shit. Sorry, what is happening? Like what the fuck is going on that this keeps happening? If they happened like every couple of days there's like a little one, like a two or three people. One, she's like not that big a deal anymore.

Speaker 6:          02:24:24       Well that's what it was when it was about knives and swords. People would go on a killing spree, but now it's, You kill more people and you know, not everybody would die with a knife.

Speaker 5:          02:24:39       London. And as a bunch of knife attacks, london has so many knife attacks that their uh, their, their murder rate exceeded New York city's murder rate with just knives. Wow. Oh, google that. Make sure that true. The machete attack, the fucking president or the mayor of president, the mayor of london saying something that they won't tolerate knives anymore. Can't have knives. Sounds sounds better. I know, but everybody's like that

Speaker 6:          02:25:05       in New York know knives. You have a guy who's a off his meds and he's just like walking around with a hammer. you know. So it could happen, it doesn't really matter what the weapon is.

Speaker 5:          02:25:15       Okay. London has overtaken New York for murders for the first time in modern history, after a surge of knife crime's across the capital verdict, though selective of statistics

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       from the start of 2018 appeared to bear this out. But the reality is that New York still appears to be more violent than london.

Speaker 1:          02:25:30       Yes, that was written. It was written by a new yorker, New York, and back. Right now, man, New York is on fire. It's great. We love it. It's great. I haven't been there as much in the last few weeks, but when I'm there and all summer I was there. It's, you're a freedom guy. I love the way you're living your life. You just fly here, fly there. Have you been to his houses or have you been to? I've seen photos of the pool. The la one is awesome. The New York one is like, um, I dunno, dump he. You could tell like he doesn't live there, you know, it's like a crash pad, but it's a, it's a, it's a nice place. I'm not saying it isn't, but it's an old school, New York building with the elevator with the guy has to use the elevator operator gold. Fancy snobby fifth avenue. Co up Mr. Ross. Snobby. But like, you know, I had to go through a co op interview. Buddy hackett wrote my recommendation. That's hilarious. York. It's all rules. So many permits. Um, you know, out god is tricky. There's shootings, there's fires. That's why the caravan turn back. Does that one,

Speaker 2:          02:26:42       do you see the photos of people like running towards the border and gas coming out? Him and the whole idea of like knowing that there's a big group of people headed towards the border. I'm like, what is this? Like, what's going on here? What? What's people are flinging? They're terrified. Imagine what they are leaving to come to that. Oh, for sure. Yeah. No, I imagine what's at home, but it's always playing that it's all this planned out event. Like everybody's watching the migration board. The board this ever happened before. Yeah. There was something that someone posted about obama in 2013. The deal during the obama administration wasn't like obama was fucking tear gas over the fence, but somebody during that administration appeared to have used a tear tear gas on an illegal immigrant as well, but it wasn't. I don't think it was this kind of thing. This kind of thing seems

Speaker 1:          02:27:37       like the cuban boatlift, like that's what I felt like about it as like they're fleeing, you know, like a dead spot or you know. Yeah. It's political and economic.

Speaker 2:          02:27:47       It's everything mean we, they want to come to the promise land like all of our ancestors did. That's why we're here. But then we got to a point where

Speaker 1:          02:27:54       I don't think it's just about just about they want to come here, it's about what's at home. That they got to get away from this. Yes. And now with the internet and information, they go, wow, maybe we don't have to be in this gang.

Speaker 2:          02:28:07       Sure. Maybe I can get my kid out when he's three instead of watching them die at 15. Yeah. And have opportunity. I mean, that's what everybody wanted. The came here in the first place. It's just at this point, if you're a poor person from Guatemala, I mean, how is it to immigrate to America if you don't have any skills, you have a very short education. It's got to be really fucking hard to become a us citizen. Probably super difficult.

Speaker 6:          02:28:32       You got to be super brave. I would go to learn another language to really figure out how to get through all the other countries and the new America. You don't have to learn it, but it certainly helps. If you want to thrive. I would go to Costa Rica. Have you been down there? Love it. Yeah, like everybody I know who's been there, they're like, this is the place. Like I'm going to move here after I retire, so that might be like a good second place.

Speaker 2:          02:28:54       Guy offered me. We'd girls and coke in front of my daughter while I was holding her hand. I was like, damn. And surf lessons. It's like everybody. There was a professional surfer on the beach, man, girls, you want coke? You want. I'm like, yo bro. Holding up five-year-old's hand is outraged. She's like discount. I'm like, what dude is offer me cocaine like right there. What you need to. Monkeys are everywhere, man. Everywhere you go, monkeys. Fucking date. They eat oreos. They open them up and chew the white part first. Yeah. They eat so many that they know how to pop them up and they chew that white shit show. Yeah. We were concerned. We were like, should we really give the monkey a cookie and cookies are toxic. It's all sugar. We gave them monkeY. The monkey took that thing. Pop the tYpe stuff probably lives on a steady diet of oreos.

Speaker 2:          02:29:45       Oreos are the minibar. That hotel and the monkeys right there give have a oreo man. I don't want to see them. They have no fear of. People just have a little bit of fear. There's a little bit of apprehension. There's a there. They'd be definitely size you up because I'm sure they run into dickhead humans and they're fucking dangerous man. I mean if they decide to fuck you up, they can hurt you. They can call your face apart, can. They can really do damage if there, especially this side of the act as a group, but they just seem to be a monkey swinging at me once on a tv set and I'll never. I'll never go to another one. Suite your face.

Speaker 6:          02:30:19       Yeah, I dunno. I was holding his hand. We were entering it like we were entering. I was hosting a gong show pilot a million years ago and I was entering with a fucking gym pole in his hand. We were in champ matching tuxedos and I got along with them all day rehearsals and then whatever. When that band kicked in and the lights were in the role and the audience he cherished, he really. I don't know if he was asking for more money or.

Speaker 2:          02:30:51       Oh, that makes sense, man. It probably hurt his ears. Probably so confused. All the people there doesn't speak your language. Doesn't know what the fuck you're saying. Right, right. Wow.

Speaker 6:          02:31:00       I have a good monkey story. Nobody has any good one. I do like where I was on another tv show and the. They had the Monkey and they go, hey, like whatever, clara, belle, whatever your name is there like this is dave, shake hands and the monkey a didn't even stop hugging the person, just let

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       the foot come up and I shook their foot because their feet are like hands and I was like, how cool is that? I couldn't get over it. I was like, if You could shake hands with your feet, like when did you do it? All the time. It's like, oh hey, what's up? Okay. So I can keep doing my other stuff. Yeah. Like, yeah. I was like, that's really cool. I just shook. Feed him versatile. Yeah. All right. Maybe it's not that great a story, but I still think that's a good monkey story. That's a win for both. I like communication, but then you know parrots, of course we can talk about it all night.

Speaker 5:          02:31:51       People who keep parents his pads and then they die because parents lived to be 90 days. She gets some old lady's parents still got 60 years left in it.

Speaker 4:          02:31:59       Yeah. And they're racIst. Who wants them? Full fucking tank. That parents get a full tank to take that thing.

Speaker 5:          02:32:09       take your pills, take your pills. You always want attentIon. they're weird. Yeah, they want to sit right on your shoulder or hidden in your hand. They want you to open up the cage. Talk to them. They want to be around you all the time. Parents are smart, man. They do not like to get just left alone. If you think you're going to be some asshole as acute bird sitting in the cage, the middle of your living room. Oh, that's my parent. I'm interesting. No, that parent needs you. Hey. Hey. They want attention, like come on mother fucker. I don't want to just sit in this case. Let me out. Let me out. Let's walk around. Let me sending your shoulder, but I don't know. See what's on tv. Come on. Fucking board. Parents are smart, man. The reason why they are not smart, they live that long. They live all long time. A long time. I think smarter or dumber than out

Speaker 4:          02:33:00       davis theory. I'm always in search of the next algebra. That's my big thing.

Speaker 5:          02:33:05       Well, we know that ravens are really smart. There's a super smart, they solve puzzles and shit, like scientists set up all these puzzles. Ravens with they'll, yeah, they'll take a stick and then use the stick to get a longer stick and then use that stick to get the, get the food out, like multistep, like problem solving. Ravens can do weird shit. But uh, and we know that a bunch, a bunch of other different birds are pretty fucking smart, but I don't know, my hawks, my hawks hawks in my neighborhood, they're smart who fly right over my house all the time and they're fascinating to watch. They really like to show off. Yeah. I would assume that all those predators have to be smart. I mean they just, they have to be ruthless and smart, you know, to get along if you're out there picking up squirrels and rats and shit, like they are doing digital firebomb and out of the sky snatching things up from angles that only they understand. My friend tom was in his backyard sitting down having a cup of coughing and he saw dove landed on top of his fence and then out of nowhere this hawk just chucked at da boom. He said it was like a big explosion of feathers that the hawk just swooped in going like 150 miles an hour glass, snatch the dove right off it and it took off and he was just sitting there with his coffee and his like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       Wow. Goes Like 10 yards from my head. It just thought it was dove. I would have kicked. Fucking landed safely. Would've landed safely back on your buddy friend told everybody if I was a dove, would kids kids have to do with the plane? Well that would make them motivated. He's a, he's a, you know, I'm protected. I see. Yeah. Don't give him that. He probably does have to fight a little bit too. It looks like he does. He does. He does. In the movie play. Micky ward. Looks like he knows how to box. He definitely knows how to throw punches, you know. This is michael b. Jordan. Thanks fascinating to me because he'll listen. He made money on it. I hope it does. Someone will tell them I'm looking. I'm sure he's a smart guy and I'm sure he's a great athlete and I'm sure he probably knows how to box a little bit, but if you kind of box guy like roy, jonah, you know what you do, you started the amateurs and you learn how to box and then you become a professional and then one day you box Roy Jones newman and the race cars.

Speaker 2:          02:35:23       So yeah, you're not going, you're not getting hit. See, the very unique thing about combat sports is you're getting hit, so it's not like someone's dunking on you. Like if you played basketball with coby bryant, you're going to get lit up, you're going to look like a fool, but you're not going to get hit a few boxes. Roy jones jr. You're gonna get you're gonna get dinged. Michael Jordan got knocked out during decreed, filming acts by with an accidental punch that landed where they. Yeah, where they were hitting him and he tried to like turn his head at the last minute, but they didn't turn it quick enough and he got clipped and dropped. Maybe that's why he knows he can take a punch now. Well, I mean maybe that's given him the confidence. He did it on purpose. He was. I think it just. I think, you know, the way it was like you take the punch then turn your habit.

Speaker 2:          02:36:07       It looked like he took the punch just a little too hard. That's real, right? That looks good, but it isn't really real gloves there. Then I use them regularly. They're using boxing gloves. Could it be bullshit? I love those korean movies and they see something like this. You don't know if it's like some thing they do for a publicity stunt. Like, watch this, see that they're practicing like this. See right there. Now see that's real dude. Yeah, that's real. See the way his head snaps in his eyes. Go play that again. That's real. I know what a real knockout looks like. I've seen a thousand of them in person. That's a real knockout. Watch. This look at this, he fucked up and he's out cold dude. He's out cold. One hundred percent. Watch this. He ran right into the punch. His head snapped Back, his eyes rolled behind his head and he wants conscious yet, but that is 100 percent legit knockout. But that punch was not even a punch. What, what, what he was hit with. He even had a mystery behind it. He didn't have any power behind it. So he was basically knocked out Just by coincidence. No, no. There's definitely power behind it. If they say yes, yes, yes,

Speaker 5:          02:37:16       yes. Listen, you could kao someone easily just doing that easily. That was perfect punch. It was a perfect punch that landed on his jaw as he was moving forward. That's the key. The key is that he was turning his head into it and he didn't think it was coming in and he took it right on the jaw if you want play it because I didn't see. What he's doing is he's there. They're choreographing how the sequence is going to go and somewhere along the line, either as a miscalculation or a mistake was made. So this will be Jordan, what's this? What's this? Right here? See that he fucked up and they turned in to do it and that guy is throwing like. I mean, even though it's not the most powerful punch in the world, it's faster than I thought and he knows how to punch.

Speaker 5:          02:37:58       Okay. So his weight is behind that. His shoulders behind that. That's a guy who's punched people in the face before he knows exactly how to do it. So even though he's only doing it like this, even though he's only doing that. So you'll run into it and he catches it on the chin. You're going out of course. and that's what happened. So why, why did that get a leak? She didn't know if it got leaked or if they put it out on perfect, they put it out to show that they probably probably put it out to show you this is hard training they're doing for this. And you know, there was an accident on the set and he got knocked out. I will be not the clip I'd want out there if I was him, but it turns into a site that was. He was younger than.

Speaker 5:          02:38:32       He's bigger and stronger now. He's older. His body's more mature, but either way. Oh, I want a box. Roy jones. The first one you got to become a career boxer. I mean, unless he's like so old, you can't take a punch. It's not going to do it. Or he would never have given up his strategy like that. I need them five, six rounds. That's just shit talking. Anything did that his whole career. Exactly how he was going to beat guys this whole career choice. Really. He's still Roy Jones jr. This is crazy. Talk like him saying just played dumb and be like, he's good. I'll do it. That's not what he would do. He would say, this is how I'm going to do it, and then he would go out and do it. Say, I'm going to need you to get tired out. See what it feels like to be in a real fight.

Speaker 5:          02:39:18       It take a beating. Yeah, man, look, if I can tell was junior just gets you into the third, fourth and fifth round and you're all, your adrenaline dump. Dump is gone because you're not used to boxing a worldclass boxer in a professional matches on paper view that millions of people are watching not used to that experience. So that experIence is taxing. It's nerve racking. You're going to have all this adrenaline rush through your body. Even if you're the the chillest of chill dude, you're going to be just a little bit too amped up, right? So then around that second round comes, then he started, he even and you can't breathe that good and you just kinda like, we're always just kind of boxing. You just boxing you. he's not hurting you. He just boxing you. Occasionally you get stung a little bit. Then the third round moves in and he starts moving left and right and come in and stinging. You hard the jab, stepping in with a lead hand, upper cut and you're like, oh fuck yeah. Now you're getting teed off on and now he's talking, he's dancing, he's moving around and then he's just charged stolen bombs on you and you can't defend them because you're exhausted and he hooks you to the liver and drops you hunted around trying to get away from get away. He's too good. he's been doing it for too long.

Speaker 4:          02:40:21       Joan said that. He says, yeah, he probably can go long and hard on me because he's all trained up, but do you think he would come and I'm like full tilt in the first round or two and just like really like take them to school. You know, like the speed downs.

Speaker 5:          02:40:33       Dangerous because when you get real aggressive is when you get hit. Because when you get real aggressive, say if I know you're coming at me, I'm, you're running at me, you're running at me. All I have to do is figure out how much time and space I need to get something off as You're coming at me because I know where you're going. It's dangerous when you don't know if someone's coming and going when someone's not. When you don't know if they're coming to going, that's when a fight is weird. So the beginning of every fight, people are feeling each other out. They don't know if someone's coming to going. If I know that you're just running at me and I'm Roy Jones jr, I'm going to step back and I'm going to time it and I crack you and I'm going to crack you in a way that you probably don't see coming.

Speaker 5:          02:41:06       You probably don't see it in the gym too much. I'm just going to stiff arm you with a jab, pop you in place, step to the left. Boom, he's going to drop out right hand on your chin. He's goIng to fuck you up, and then he's going to turn around. He's going to be behind you and he's gonna. Look at you to see if you're still okay and then he's going to do it again and he's going to keep doing it. If you keep chasing after him, you're going to still get fucked. You're going to get fucked up and going to get your face punched in. So the only other thing is to do is like you've got a buxom, so okay, now you're boxing one of the greatest boxers of all time and he just, and he's just going to just figure you out.

Speaker 5:          02:41:36       Like what do you go, what do you do when I do this? What happens when I do this? What happens here? Could I have punched you? Oh, I could have. And then he's going to figure out when to move and when you're going to get tired and he's going to start dropping bombs on you, it's going to be awful. Which you have respected it. If he said, oh, you know, I want to box a few matches first and then get to roy. I think he's just talking shit. He was just having a good time. Probably didn't expect anybody to run with it. He didn't expect people to analyze it. That's the guy who you know. And that video. This guy, he's an real boxer, huh? Oh yeah. You're knocked out. David haye before. His name is tony bellew. Oh dude, that, that's, that guy is a legit boxer.

Speaker 5:          02:42:13       he just got stopped by that bad ass russian motherfucker on a well look what he's doing. Tv really recently, lIke his guy. that's it. These are top flight boxer. So for him to knock him out, of course it was just. He's so good man. So for him to do it accidentally makes complete total sense. Well look at the. Yeah, that guy is a beast man. That's like a legit top flight boxer. so he's in there even just accidentally getting punched in the face by to see the movie. I'll tell you tHat Michael Jordan talking shit to recover and get back to training and, and, and

Speaker 4:          02:42:49       filming after that. In the heavyweight class, you never saw abs until the movies. You never. It was always like, I know, right. You know, they were like, they were like basically punching bags now. Now it's like they have to be. So

Speaker 5:          02:43:01       tyson. You saw abs when he came out of prison. Remember that? I guess when you fought peter mcneely, dude, he was prison jacked. That was like maybe the scariest tyson ever. Like they finally

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       released him and all he'd been doing in jail. I don't think he could box in jail, so I think he was just lifting weights. You remember he was super, super jacked when he got out of jail. He was. Yeah. See, go to tyson. Pei. That's tyson versus peter mcneely. That was in 1995. It looks good. They're terrifying. That was the most terrifying movie tyson ever. He just looked like he was made out of steel. Just a tank of a man, and I'll never forget the fucking way in or the stare down rather because during the steer down, peter mcneely signed up for that fight knowing that he's a tough guy who's going to take a fucking vicious beating. That's what he signed up for. He knew what he was doing. He knew he going to give it his all, but he knew if you had to bet, most people were not betting on Peter Mcdonald. Yeah, but you could see it in tyson's face when he's staring them down. There's this crazy. He's following him everywhere. He goes like a predator dude. It's like a predator who can't wait to get the green light to let the genie out of the bottle. Watch this. This is tysons first fight like peter is kind of looking down and you look over time. So we'll get his eyes. Dad is fucking terrifying

Speaker 1:          02:44:23       if you're looking at that and you know, smiling and trying to like, he's trying to like make light of it. Oh my god. He looks just like a prison guard dude. He. Oh yeah, he does. That's really guard here. After the green mile hair, I sat next.

Speaker 6:          02:44:51       I sat next to tyson at after the, at the charlie sheen roast and made a lot of jokes about him and uh, afterwards dice call me. I didn't really know. Dice at the time, called me like a couple of weeks later, he's like, jeff dice. He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like basically said that he couldn't believe I said those things to Mike Tyson. Like he was offended and I go, what do you mean? He's like, do you have any idea what that animal could have done

Speaker 1:          02:45:20       two feet away.

Speaker 6:          02:45:23       We've been friends ever since, but I didn't, I didn't think about tyson. He seemed like a pussy cat at the time, at the time. But if that was tyson from like 1986, I think if I watched an old fight.

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:45:38       by the end of the night. I'm literally like laughing and it was a lap.

Speaker 2:          02:45:42       Well once loved it. Yeah. Yeah. He loves jokes. He could take jokes. Oh yeah, but you wouldn't want to be

Speaker 6:          02:45:49       that. Imagine if I said I don't want to piss you off mike, if you would do that to your face, imagine what you would do to

Speaker 2:          02:45:59       basically the only celebrity to ever pull off a face mask. Face tats. I thought. No. Who else has done it? What? Celebrity feud. Charles manson. Well, those, those mumble rapper dudes. Yeah. Like postman

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       alone loan type characters to kashi. Sixty nine. But he was the first by a long stretch and you're being pulled off as if he pulled that off. Still. Mike tyson not good. You know what I mean? Hope gucci mane. Oh, that's right. He had the ice cream cone. Was that first though? I feel like wow, close. Probably same time. Wow. That's a commitment that got. Has that on his face anymore. This new pictures. It looks like. Get that off. That'll get you removed. Yeah, they live. They can lead you that shit off, but I haven't, but it looks like somebody carved into his face. It doesn't even look like a tat. well that's because it's fresh because that's like right after it got made. It's still. They're not as a bright. Let me see. That man's got an ice cream cone on his face, but now it's yogurt.

Speaker 1:          02:46:55       It's just different time. Is that today though? He's got more tests to. Oh, so they're all over the place. That dude's always smiling. Ever since you got out of jail. He seems like the happiest guy in the world for real. He's got a beautiful good on him. They looked. The tattoos look good. I said, but why is there ice cream like right there? Like does he have a tongue where he's like, hey look, I can look ice cream. No, because then we don't want to be able to lick the bottom part. He Wouldn't even get the real ice cream cone somewhere else and he's got a lot of tattoos. Yeah. It looks good though.

Speaker 1:          02:47:25       But the pearls takes him the mean out of the highest tattoo you have to your face. Oh, it goes up to my shoulder. Both arms. Basically the same. So you can see all your tattoos. Yeah. Yeah. Don't have any other ones. Just these. No tattoos. Jeff. I'm thinking of getting a tramp stamp. Dave and I are going to get them to say. Come on. Mine says free wifi. Mine's going to say too legit to shit. I'm going. I'm going with watch out. Terrible ahead. Fear has keep on trucking. Tattoo side. In hebrew it's the only tattoo. It's preposterous. Keep on trucking. Yeah. Jamie? Yeah, he's gotta. Keep on trucking. Tattoo. I'm right about this. Right. I was looking for, it says keep on trucking. Who used to have it was tony danza you said of like keep on trucking.

Speaker 1:          02:48:21       I was like a thing that people used to say. I'm sure I had to keep on trucking patch or tee shirt and a hat. Like what was that? What was going on to keep on trucking? Hang in there, baby. That was one. Keep on trucking. Nobody had hanging. Blah. I'm sure people got hang in there. Baby tattoos, right? What am I saying? Nobody should have done it when he got. This is a bumping my cat. Shut the fuck up. Is that mine? Yeah. You can put it near your dave's whole porn hat that I don't even have one of these. Yeah, you do. I've given you two of them. That show was fun. That was a good one. Joe. You really rocked that show. It was fun. That was a great show. That should never take that off. The air bumping mix. Yeah, but I hope it's not a. I hope it's not a bad light.

Speaker 6:          02:49:08       I give him always a hat from every show. He always helps me out and they go nowhere. The shows. That's not true. Now this one's a hit. I'm hoping this is our moment in that kind of jinxes. This is our moment. This is the talking flip phone. If you're worried about gypsy curse, don't give up. You talk about your last special. Took a long time to get together. This tickled took us a couple years ago. Not even. It came together pretty quick from montreal to a year later we shot it, but like I feel like it's also like about our friendship or whatever you wanna call it for 25 years, so it kind of puts, uh, puts a nice button on it. Oh, it's the first button maybe. What are you doing over there? You're mixing up. Do I just don't want to leave my asHes here? Dave has a lot of weird cigarette coffee kind of straw so you're letting me smoke in here.

Speaker 6:          02:50:01       was like, thank you. I'm glad it worked. It works great. If tHere's any like low spectrum people watching our show, you can wish. Watch dave and just cigarettes. You'll learn a lot. In my weird phobias. Dice was the reason why I put it in my dyson. How much is he smoking now? He doesn't smoke as I haven't. I haven't seen him in quite a while. But last time you did the podcast, was he. Did he smoke the last time or a time before that? He takes time off. I think for awhile he would just bring them on the smoking. He's smoking smoking a lot. I saw him. I came on his new podcast recently and um, it's uh, I'm, I'm over here. He made me, he made me pretend he was half an hour late even though I was 10 minutes. He had a whole bit work that where I had to go in the studio and just wait and talk to myself basically that he has to come in pretending he's late.

Speaker 6:          02:50:52       that was the only direction for an hour and a half. It's so funny, man. That's, he cracks me up so much my first time. So my second time headlining was opening for ray romano in poughkeepsie and dice is at the height of his fame. I've dressed like I'm like, you had to be to even get work. And it's like I'm a jersey comic, 1990, 91 and dices at the, at the, uh, poughkeepsie civic center right next door to the comedy club. And uh, and our hotel, we heard dice was staying there. People were pulling the fire alarm. It's like it was like the biggest base of rockstar. Yeah. Pulling fire alarms. Try to get everybody evacuated so dice would come out. Right. Fine. Finally our show on his shows on saturday, friday night. Now ray romano was headlining at poughkeepsie whenever closed the bananas. Oh yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:51:46       I remember that place. And just, I'm up there. I'm doing my 10 slash 12 minute opening and through the darkness, this guy I kind of recognized from like news articles was a club soda. Kenny comes through the darkness with a note friday night and uh, the note just says please welcome the king of comedy day. So as I read it and the place was fine, right? Like so nice. WAlks on stage, he does whatever, like a 15 minute guests at the crowd goes crazy. They loved it. And then I learned a lot. Actually. Ray romano came up as the headliner who was not known at all. He wasn't on tv yet and killed raising crops, but I Really learned like, oh, you know what the audience will follow. We'll watch a great comic. No matter what. Just happened. Ray was in his prime back then too

Speaker 2:          02:52:36       for read jimmy's comedy, allie queens and ray was. That was when ray was just. He had done, hbo had done something on hbo, but he was just a machine man. People like people didn't realize how mean he is a great time. Those guys that people don't talk about when they talk about great standup comics because he hasn't put a lot of stuff out there in a long time ever since. Everybody loves raymond. A lot of stuff. As far as the standup, he just shot a netflix special at the seller so that should be coming out soon. But you're right, he hasn't put out anything until. I think this is like his first real our. So he. I know he was working with Kevin James. He did a bunch of gigs together. Some I'm friends with kevin. He goes on the road but he still murders was my point. That's right. He's still merge

Speaker 6:          02:53:21       comic. He was always so funny and you could always. Someone wants to describe it like you could airdrop him anywhere and his go kill. Yeah, like anywhere in America before people relatable. We're all kinda the same, like we all kind of lift into the same stuff now, but he's another guy like, couldn't be a nicer guy. One of the best. He's always been really cool to me and you know, like do the height of his fame never changed for a second. [inaudible] never kind of weird how the asshole sort of disappear eventually. You don't even know where they evaporate too when I'm still here. You know, you're talking to, you're talking about you're a comedIan. You almost before you were an american. That's when. And that doesn't mean I don't love my car. I'm not trying to act like I'm very aware. Of course. Of course. You're so attached to being a comedian that's in my blood in a way that, well, do you feel more comfortable

Speaker 2:          02:54:10       comics and how devastating would it be if the other comics didn't want you around that man without a country that's, that's where it gets fucking dark man, right? Yeah. That's where it. So anybody who falls into that group, like if you fucked up, like the whole thing is to be friends with the comedian. Hang is what it's about, you know, the hang.

Speaker 6:          02:54:33       So how did you feel? Let me ask you, how did you feel when you were in self, um, you know, you, you pulled yourself out of the world at a comedy store where you started, did you feel like on a desert island by yourself or did you find community at the other clubs or.

Speaker 2:          02:54:48       I never found the same thing, uh, but I just kept working and I always was working with ari and joey and dunkin. I still kept working with those guys. So I was like, I was working with most of the same comics and I was just doing practice sets at the ice house and at the improv I remember all that. It's just, to me it was more, it was, you know, the hang was on the same. I would do my psets the improv and just get the fuck out of there. There's no place to hang out. It's not like the same how you get to do fun for sure. You got to do stand up on the spot, roast battle, made room a oh are and whatever. You'd figured out in the parking lot without him and then a podcast in the basement. You could literally, you can put a gym in there.

Speaker 2:          02:55:26       You'd probably never leave everything in that place. You could do three. I've done three shows. No, I've done four shows in a night because one night I did two sets in the main room, one set and the belly room and one set in the or because it was to show. That's crazy to follow this motherfucker. So many times everything I ever taped with you on the show, I developed funnel having to try to follow him. Wow. Like steam rolling like civilization. Everything from harvey weinstein to like his own inner fucking craziness. That's, that's all in 20 minutes. So it's like the, the crowds, you know, like uh, like a get spoiled when they see so many great acts like just come by and just for like 10 bucks, 20 bucks, whatever. They get to see chris rock, you, joe. and like, just like people dropping by and working on stuff they like.

Speaker 2:          02:56:14       Is it like this all the time? Like you don't even get it. You just saw a $500 show for like two drinks. You know what? I always say that to the people at the cellar to if you're a fan of comedy, it's time. That's what missing new year's right together. And I attribute all this to the thing that you hate the web. The internet did all this. That's the reason why everybody's aware of how fun it is to go to a live comedy show. How fun it is to watch guys. Like they'll go to see you at the store and then they go to see you again six months later and go, oh, that fucking comedy central and hbo and showtime and netflix and all the ones that comedy central definitely made it for sure. Comedy central for sure. All those things definitely attribute to it.

Speaker 2:          02:56:53       But what about evening at the improv tube is one of the biggest factors. The fact that people can watch, stand up on youtube, that's a giant factor. The amount of people that are watching youtube is off the charts and the fact that they can Just type in right now, Jeff Ross, standup comedy poom and instantaneously get it and a lot of those clips come from comedy central, hbo and all those other places, which is great. It's like it's all. It all contributes. Not one thing that did it, but I think the one big important factor was this new channel of distribution and that's the internet, whether it's netflix, which is probably one of the biggest thing right now for stand up comedy specials ever. RiGht. And there's never been a thing like netflix, well look what we're doing three episodes. It's like, exactly. Who else would let you do that? Well will take the pressure oFf like one shiny special, you know, like you can do, be more creative with how you present your art. Oh yeah. Well if you wanted to do a two parter next time, you could narrow it right already did with. That was not the one that he's working on right now, but the last one that's right in the same place. Yeah. Yeah. That red, so good man, he's out there. Our review was harping on was Like the comedy is

Speaker 1:          02:58:01       completely reinvented lately, but do it as a series. You could do whatever you want that as a comedy fan, netflix is perfect because you know you don't have to. You get to control what you see, you know, and you can watch it and stop it and watch it more and even stop it. I was watching her show when it came out last night. I was just laying in bed watching our new show because I was by my sister and like when it gets to the end of the episodes, you've got nowhere. That remote is try to get you to binge. Come on, you don't understand. It's like, oh man. Another episode for this episode ends with dave just looking in the camera and being like, our next episode starts at five, four, three. I heard that you

Speaker 2:          02:58:47       god. See the new mike judge, an animated show about country music called the band. What is it called? Road stories from something that sounds great. yeah, he is another guy, man. That guy posted down the nominal. My love, ella was just talking about it on this podcast. What is it called? Tales from the tour bus from the tour buses supposed to be insanely funny. It's about George Jones and all those guys, but it's all like gunplay and drugs and chaos, country music stuff, and then they animate like the story. It's really cool. He really is a talented guy. Man. Funk music creates this one. Uh, yes, that's it. Here's one of the ways I thought it was all country guys. Yeah, I thought so too. But there's a different maybe separate seasons or something that the highway man click on highway man. So that's with Willie Willie Nelson. Willie nelson. Oh, spotify, waylon jennings, kris kristofferson and Johnny Cash. That's an episode.

Speaker 2:          02:59:50       That's just a song. highway been. So that's the song. The highwaymen when they all got song, that mega group. Yeah, but that's not an episode of the show is. This is a playlist of songs. Oh. Oh, confusion. So I went to their webpage here and. Oh, I get it. This must be a new season whether they use in the seventies, people. Do you know that song highwayman? Yeah, that's star stars across the universe to vive and when I reached the other side, that's a creepy song, right? It's about reincarnation and you never fade away. Yeah. People built this country. Yeah, blood, sweat and. But getting them all together. I wonder what that was like. I know, right? Those, those guys. How's it going?
