Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. You know, I have to sit back and all the time and try to think for myself that

Speaker 2:          00:08          you, you've,

Speaker 1:          00:10          I love my library, that I have all the books within it. I love the cars that I have. I love the relationships that I have, but there's a give her instead of the relationship, but just the things and it's like these are all great things, but if I don't have them, I am still me. I still have everything that I need in this world. I don't like to think about them being lost, destroyed. I certainly hate the idea of it being destroyed because he was, it wasn't in my hands. I'd like them to still exist for others, but without them. I'm no different than who I am now. And I guess that's kind of a thinking of like the Stoics, uh, you've been more defined by your accomplishments and your thinking and your philosophy. There's lots of things that people, obviously they couldn't know about me.

Speaker 1:          00:54          They, it, because it's not the kind of thing that is, is just my who I am. Right. And I don't need someone to know whether or not I'm smart or whether or not I know this or whether or not I can do that. It's like I'll do it when I need to do it and I, I have to try and look to see that I have my own inner peace is based on my own self knowledge and knowledge also that I am lacking, that I can be better, that I, and if I want to, I can choose to. And those days that I don't, it was a choice not to be better. It wasn't that I couldn't because even going and failing like we talked about before is a worthwhile endeavor because it will move you towards either a eventually getting there or b, that it's not something that's going to be yours, but you know what it is and you know what it takes to get there. And that's a different perspective altogether and

Speaker 2:          01:44          okay,

Speaker 1:          01:45          that is where I feel like that's where I can be okay in this world and deal in, in. There's all kinds of things that you can draw your focus and really eat at you and bother you and you're giving weight to these things and allowing them to have an effect on you and that's natural. That's a normal thing and it's easy to fall into. But if you can be okay with all right, if all I'm left with is just me and what I have, if I no longer have anything, no, no more luxuries, no more this, no more of that. Can you be okay with that? You know, what kind of life would you make of this? And I like to think the same one I have now. You can pick me up here, take all my shit away, throw me some other part of the world, the third world country and it will be jarring. It will be difficult and there'll be some lament of course, but I will continue to be who I am. I will see what is necessary to, to communicate with others and to continue to propagate this that I'm trying to create in me. That's hilarious. Yeah. Did of the new, have you ever been a place where it felt weird? We found out that someone died there. You ever been in a place where you felt the presence of it in? That felt weird

Speaker 3:          02:59          because you know some violence was going to pop off and I knew it, right? Oh yeah. I was like, let's get the fuck outta here. Right. As you can tell, you can feel that somebody's dying. No. I was at a concert once in a brawl broke out and I quit. I was a security guard and a, I was a neil young concert and it broke out and I put a Hoodie on. I zipped it up and covered my security outfit. I'd walk right the fuck out of there. I was like, you out of your fucking mind, jumping into this fray, getting clocked in the head by somebody. Like people were fighting and they were there. They canceled the show and kicked everybody out. People are lighting fires. I was at a, what was it? Just not this odd vibe awards when when Dr Dre got jumped at it and a young buck stabbed a guy.

Speaker 3:          03:43          Oh, I was there. Wow. And I was doing a show for UPN and this was back when upn was still a network and a one of the execs from upn was there with her young son. He will who wanted to see all the rappers and he's sitting at the table with us and I saw like the g unit group come in. Then I sort of death row guys come in and I saw drays group commit and I'm sitting there and I tell, I forgot to get lady's name. I said, hey, you might want to get your kid out of here. Something's about to go down. Wow. And she's like, what do you mean? I'm like, it's about to, it's about to go. And she's like, he's so excited. He wanted to see dre and he loves 50 sending them, listen, get this kid. It was a little white kid to them.

Speaker 3:          04:19          Oh my God, there's, can I go say hi and I'm like, you get them out of here. And when it's like the second time I said it like, Yo, you might want to really get them out of it. It's going to pop off. Boom. Dre gets punched in the face, Malay young bucks stabs guy. And I'm like, I told you Jesus. And like two days later on set, she's just like, how did you know that? I'm like, I know that. I know the energy in the room. I could feel it. I've been around it too many times. That's a crazy feeling to when people are about to do something with this. Yeah. You see them, you see them walk, you see the look. You know, it's like, it's sad, but it's true. Like when you grow up in the hood, you have that instinct. You have that, that look, you look at a guy walked past, you would one time and you look at, look around the room and okay, it's about to go. It's about to go.

Speaker 3:          05:06          People that have never experienced that probably wouldn't know what to do. Right. They wouldn't, they would think nothing of it like that lady. Like she never seen those signs before. Yeah, I've been on the road. It's uh, this was recently, like maybe three months, four months ago. I had a my feature at my feature comic with me, he's from Chicago actually and we're in a club after the show and it's a couple of guys talking in the corner and I said something to a girl, she's like, Hey Tony Rock and have a little small talk and she walks over to the group of guys and one guy walks over and stands at the end of the bar here and one guy stands ended up out here and I turned to my friend Dave and I go, Yo, you ever been a fight in a ball before? And he said No.

Speaker 3:          05:42          I said, get ready motherfucker. You got to be in one cause I saw it, Jesus. And then third guy comes over. So funny, the third guy comes over and he's like, Oh shit, you are a comedian. And I said, yeah. He said, I thought that was you was over there talking and I was like, I thought that was the comedian guy and he's got a good picture man. I took a picture with him and he's called all the guy, but like, yeah, was was comedian. It was him that was like, he kinda just squashed it cause he, I guess they didn't know who I was. Oh, it was going to go, but because I said something to the girl, oh no, it was the comedian is hit. And I'm like, hey fellows, what's up now? I, you know, I turned into the community like, what's up guys?

Speaker 3:          06:14          I got to do and y'all, all right, what'd you guys need to drink? Let's do a round of shots, you know? Oh man, Dave's like, that's done all that. And I'm like, I know mother fuckers going to go. It was going to go. Oh yeah. If he ain't never been around violent people, you probably don't smell that vibe. Right. You smell that vibe. Who knows who's on steroids. When you saw it, it came through, you know, the guys that kind of like, their body's changed some of the people who dropped off radically. Yeah. So quick, really quick. It's like, whoo, I never thought, yeah, well not just change, but change to the point where like you're not even the same person. Yeah. You're like doing an mph and the guys in their 20s doing them an impression of who they were just a couple of years ago on the sauce.

Speaker 3:          06:57          Yeah. Shit's happening man. Well he got caught up in a band. I'm snitching. I saw the thing was he was the golden snitch. I, he's a Mac. He sent it to me. He was texting me as well. Novitsky he's a good guy, man. He's just like, he's got a bad reputation from a lot of people. Like it'd be cool with them cause I know me and I'm not cheating. I'm not a guy that now he's, what is his official title? It's like athletes. Those how would cheat on, wouldn't be hanging around him like the way I would or wouldn't be as friendly with them because they didn't want him sniffing around. Well he's there to make sure that someone doesn't cheat on youtube though. 100% and I'm like, please, I'm, I'm, I'm not mad at it. Yeah. What's that? Oh, was we competed? What does it say? The Golden Jeffrey.

Speaker 4:          07:43          John Devinsky. The golden snitch is the vice president of athlete health and performance for the UFC. Holy Shit, Brendan Show Up. Made it. Brendan Schaub living.

Speaker 3:          07:59          When did you smoke weed? You ever get paranoid?

Speaker 5:          08:02          One time I did an edible. I ate too much. So you know Jim, our neighbors. Sure. A very funny comic. He gave me an edible one time and this was before like anybody could just walk into a dispensary. Like, cause now you just have to show your id and you can get anything from the dispensary. But this was when you had to have a, a card. So he went in and got it for me and it was this lemon bar that said award winning on it. And me being the weed novice, I was like, oh this is going to be award winning because of the taste. Right. It's like, I was like, this is like a Paula deen recipe. And so I ate like half of it and I was by myself and I woke up, I was laying down and I was in my bed and I sat up and I said, am I talking to myself?

Speaker 5:          08:44          I'm not talking to myself. Oh my God, I am talking to myself. I'm not talking to myself. I am and I was saying this out loud. I have to check. I went on my phone to get on twitter to see them, make sure the world was still happening because I was like, I felt like I was in some weird twilight zone. It was, yeah, it was awful. So I got on there and then I made my forced myself to go to sleep because I was like, I can't be awake like this. So I forced myself to go to sleep. I woke up the next morning, I was still high for like five more hours. It was awful. Yeah. I gave my friend edible and he called me up a day later and said, I'm still high a day later if you don't know what you're doing with it. Because I had a conversation with someone else the other day and they were like, I ate there, I for some Rice Krispie treats and I was like, why would you eat four of them? He called the cops, call the cops and then checked him. Set you like went to a hospital because he thought he was dying.

Speaker 3:          09:37          Do you ever see the one where it was a nine one one call? The cops took weed from these people. They pulled them over and then the cops use the weed to make pot brownies and then they ate the pot brownies and they called nine one on themselves. They called for an ambulance. They said there were dying. Please send help. Time's moving very slowly. But what's hilarious is it's a fucking nine one one call from a cop from a cop and the cop is calling to get an ambulance. Can we say the time is moving slowly and they stole the weed from these fucking kids that they pulled over. The whole thing is just, it's brilliant. It's so funny. Oh Man. It's one of my all time favorite nine one one calls cause it's just so sad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can, can you, can you please send help times moving very slowly.

Speaker 3:          10:24          What to play it as I was looking up an article about it, uh, the cop had to, he resigned before he got in trouble for, he resigned. Taking the weed and be using it so he quit. Yeah. That's probably good movement as part of you at that point, you kind of have to, yeah. He called nine one one and we're talking about in a podcast years later, everybody's heard that. Yeah, I didn't. You'd never that fucking a guarantee. The video is probably been played a million times. Easily more than a million. Do you have a jamie? Yeah. I just, I found this a shorter version. Okay. Listen to this. Poor fucked. Just think about this and to save

Speaker 6:          11:02          marijuana. I don't know if they had something in it. Hey, police and rescue. You guys have fever? No, I'm just, I think we're dying. Oh, how much did you guys have? I Dunno. We made brownies and I think what that time is going by really, really, really low

Speaker 3:          11:20          lady laughing. See, pot is something that even when you're having an overdose, people laugh at you.

Speaker 7:          11:35          Okay.
