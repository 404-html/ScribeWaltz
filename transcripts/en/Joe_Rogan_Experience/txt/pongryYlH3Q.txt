Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Okay. Poor people on Twitter. I made them wait for like five minutes with a lie. I said we were ready to go, but it really, I was being optimistic. Brian Catlin, I understand that you understand, do you understand the pressure that we're under this episode sponsored by Squarespace. Squarespace is a website that allows you to build your own, uh, personal or business website yourself easily. Um, they have over 20 bad ass designs. You can get a Giddy at 24, seven support from super fast email support that there like there if you, you can't figure it out how to do it, but it's really easy to do. You're going to get it. I can get it. Brian's done a million of them. They have it set up so it looks great on Ipad, android, iPhone, everything. I'm not even a tech guy and I use it. It works because they sponsored my, yeah, it's so, it's so easy to use.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       It's, it's, it's like one of the coolest websites ever as far as like a functional websites for creating websites, including um, putting together a store and you can put together an online store and like 10 clicks. It's, it's, it's stupid easy. I don't know if it's 10 clicks, don't hold me to that, but you could figure it out. I'm using it to set up my, or they're so confident about it that they let you try it before you even buy it. So he can try their, their website creating process and you don't even have to enter a credit card. And then if you decide to use it, you say, you know what I'm going to use? This is going to be my website now. Then you enter in your credit card, you use the code Joe and the number eight for the month of August and you'll get a 10% is it September yet? Shit, it is September. It did become some stuff like God, September 1st you guys mess around day, dude, it's September 2nd. That's the second day to day, but it's Labor Day so you don't have to do shit. Yay. That's you sound like an awesome dude to run a house too.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       Anyway. Uh, let's just go with Joe nine then. Fuck it. But either one of them work Joey or Joe Nine. Either one will get you 10% off. I think it's just for their sake monitoring. When you decided when my commercial sucked at a certain point. Dot. If two people that have to be like, you know, you know he sent it in it in. I know he has. I know he really doesn't give a fuck about Squarespace. He said it too many times. It can't mean anything anymore. But one of the things we try to do on the shows, anything that we advertise, we try to make sure it's legit. Squarespace. Squarespace seems very legit as far as the responses we've gotten from people that have tried it, it's been overwhelmingly positive. So I'm willing to, I'm willing to back it. I think it's a good product and it looked pretty bad ass and Brian County uses it as I do and Brian red bands made like a hundred websites with it. Okay. And we're also brought to you. You is that still up? Squirt Burt still up fears legs. It's still up. I'll get off and there's legs. They sell anything at arch feels legs. He should just be plastic. Homer Simpson miles. That's it. Deep inside joke. We're also brought to

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you by legal zoom. Legal Zoom is a website that allows you to create your own, uh, I shouldn't say create your own legal documents, but fill out legal documents. Things like an LLC you can do for $99. That's what it starts at. You can incorporate or form an LLC without going to a lawyer and paying a lot of money. He could do it naked. That's what I've been trying to promote. People masturbating while using legal zoom. I mean, I really want you to proofread, so go over your stuff. Make sure he got it right, but as you can, if I could prove that more people use legal zoom from my website because of them being naked, take pictures. It's the government's looking at you, man. They're looking at you right to that camera. That's what I hear. That little camera right there. And I was everywhere. I just turn them on. I had a porn lawyer, this guy had on my podcast say that, uh, he, he wouldn't do any of those chat rooms or anything because those cameras are working at somebodies recording. I'm sure at this point the, the, the ship has sailed. Yeah. It's ship has sailed. You know, if you're, if you're beaten off, someone's got a video of it, there's no doubt.

Speaker 2:          00:04:04       So, um, that's all going to come out in the wash. But the reality is if you, um, if you want to save money and get some shit done, like writing a will, it's very easy to do. Legal Zoom can also connect you with an independent attorney if you panic. Like if you get in the middle of that Shit and you're filling out forms or like I'm going to go to jail, he may have be me too. Um, um, yeah. It's funny how we have blind spots to that stuff. Big Law, legal stuff, financial stuff. Why we have massive add my friend, massive add can't. There's certain things you can talk about me and just start talking about options and swaps. I'm like Greek. It sounds like great walking away from you right now. I taught the crazy swaps like wife swaps. Wild that that too, but that makes me panic and dude willing to swap wives.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       You don't want that one. I know what I'm saying. He's given us taller. Do you think that like when you get older though, that's actually just something you do? Sure. Like when you were like 60 70 like you just start swapping wives when we've discussed this before. When you're 60 or 70 go walk down the beach, go fishing. Your time is over. Nobody wants to fuck you. Even if they do, fuck you. It's going to be a disaster. You know they're going to look at you while you're fucking them and go. All marks the hardest I've ever laughed and my life was watching. You do stand up on what it's like for those girls to have sex with with you. Half of it was like they're lucky. They're lucky, lucky, lucky. Please don't paraphrase. It says zero to do with legal. zoom.com has a great fit.

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       Have you done that recently? No, I can't do it anymore. It's over. I don't feel that way anymore. Anyway. Legal Zoom is not a law form. They provide self help service at your specific discretion. What direction? You said La Forum Forum Forum. It's not a forum. It's a forum or a form or a a legal zoom is not a law firm. It's a weird word from it means so many different things like a group of people and like a nice ass. Why? It's also not something you could really describe what man as as a straight man you can't be like, you know it's from from guy. What's kind of bond a things like a firm look, you know a guy can give you a firm look. Yeah, firm handshake do with touching. So that's the thing. Like he can't be like, he's very firm. Right? But isn't it weird?

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       We also use law firm for that. It's we're, we're like, why did we run out of fucking words for Shit? I don't know. He say he's from on the price is very flat price. Why English is like one of the most difficult languages to learn actually. Apparently it is. Yeah. That's what keeps us stupid and preoccupied trying to figure out our language. Anyway, go to legal zoom.com use a codeword Rogan. Save yourself some money. It's a an excellent service. I highly recommend it. There's a lot of shit. Uncle creepy is going to try to do his, it's Ian Mccall. UFC fighters going to try and do is divorce through illegal zoom. Really? I hope he's getting a sponsor for that. They don't see, it's not a law firm though, so I don't know. I mean they could probably like give it to them for free. I think that's the issue is like they can't do it for him.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       Yeah. Yeah. He's going to have to do himself. Not me. I came gave away your whole house. I marked 100% not 50% yeah, dude, it's legal and some of the, I've, I've read some legal things before and it's like, oh no wonder why. There's debates on interpretations of some things. The other thing that I think about is like if you ever sign a tax return or you buy a house or something or, or a car. I just signed, I'm not reading anything. I'm literally like, what? Okay, sign here. Just sign this release. I know. Yeah, it's sweet. It's sweet. It says you're a sweetie or sweets. Who would be nice to each other anyway, legal, zoom.com code name, Rogan. God. Tim, he's a taking a lot longer than I wanted them to. I was trying to get through a quick today, a g, g plus Mu.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Anyway, this episode is also brought to by a on it.com o. N. N. I. T. We have the newest kettle bells in and our primal kettle bell series. It's a rang a Tang. It's a 1.5 pooed Aubrey promises. We're going to put the weights. Any stupid things? Yeah. What is it? Food? Is it a [inaudible]? So rush should method of a measurement and old school method like stone for, you know, for English. English stone is, what is it? 13 pounds, 14 pounds. Pooed I think one Puente is 35 pounds. So two pood is 70. And what would that make? One and a half pooed it's 54. Is that what it is? Yeah, but that's not an orangutan. That's a chimp and I, and I'm on a mountain gorilla. No, no. There's a chimp, a mountain gorilla, an orangutan [inaudible] tanks in the middle. That's, that's just simply incorrect. Just a wide face champion. No, it's, if you had, if it had color to it, it would look like, so I'm going to say they're all evenly balanced. This is one of the most important things about when decided to create

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       these things. The guy who did them, I mean, I kind of need to find out who it is, who the actual artist is and credit him because he's fucking amazing. Um, I'm going to text RB while the show's going. Those are almost things you could have like, you know, greeting your guests, you know, on either side of the door. Yeah. Yeah. Their artwork, door weights there, or artwork as much as they are. That's why I wanted, if I had to rob a house when I saw those on the front porch, I might choose another house having a pit bull. Maybe it's insecurity thing. I can't just work out with weights. I have to work out with weights that look like gorillas. I want to scare bitch. We sell uh, all kinds of different shit. I'm trying to write to a all brewed right now. Who's the artist, Bro?

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       Right now people are listening. Go edit the shit out, bitch. Sorry, I should have edited that out. But uh, I had a text and a, I'm not that good at texting. I'm not that good at texting. I'm, I'm a little annoyed and big, thick, blonde thumbs. That's also a little annoyed that after all these years, um, my phone is trying to pretend that I didn't say fucking yeah, I know and I have to go back. I didn't say duck going, you fucking change. I wrote Af, you know, I wrote out. Right. Why did they do that? Because more people would, we, it can't assume that you're going to make a swear because then what if it makes that assumption and it makes a swear when you meant to write, ducking, playing, like you know, you were ducking, you got fucking between dock. Whoa. Yeah. It has to go with doc.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       Yeah. That's a big difference. Like you were ducking or you were fucking like, did you see me? Why not? One, you don't give a fuck face other you get divorced or yeah. Or people panic. Like was high. She's a fuck. Yeah. Anyway. Um, battle ropes, kettlebells, medicine balls, all kinds of different shit. That's all designed for total human optimization. That's the idea behind a lifting weights with a w or things that would give you functional strength. It's very difficult stuff. So I always recommend people start out light and get some instruction. If you can go to a professional trainer or someone who's RKC certified, preferably someone who really knows how to do kettlebells and spend whenever they charged, you know, like whatever a session is and just like videotape. It is plenty of videos out there that are really good as well. We sell a couple of them on on it. Uh, the um, Keith Weber videos are excellent extreme kettlebell cardio DVDs. Just absolutely fantastic stuff. And um, but I think it's really important if you've never lifted any weights before to have someone show you how to do it correctly, start out light, use good form and will, you'll get real benefits for a health and fitness. It's a, it's great for functional strength. Even if you're just talking about like things around

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       plus it makes you look sexy as fuck. Can I? Oh, thank you. [inaudible] for days. I call him Joe shoulders for days, Rogan. Um, we also sell a bunch of different vitamins and supplements. Use a codename Rogan and you'll save 10% off any and all supplements. I just did that. I just changed that. Pooed and the whole time you were saying that, I said that's how we need to fix that. Easy. He probably hasn't, you need to get website authors. Can I take those kettle bells with me when I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. Did there you son of a bear. Good Nights. Hi Charlie Goodnight's old school comedy club right there. I'm excited. That place has been around for a long time. I loved that place. The green room is, you're in the way of all the waitresses. No Green Room. Like when you try to, you have to like stand in this like little box area that's near the waitresses.

Speaker 2:          00:12:47       So he's like, oh, excuse me, sorry. And they're all like, we need 706 we need five over here. Great Place. Old School place tempered 12th, 13th 14th. Yeah. I love doc joint. That's like a real one of the last old school, real comedy clubs in this country. I, every time I could do it a club like that. And I see they have an old school club in Atlanta. There's another one, xannies and Nash. There's another place called [inaudible] in Santa San Jose. I can't remember the name of it. Um, ah, I wish I could remember it, but it's the same thing. Tiny place and all school. I mean the woodcreeks. Yeah, just, yeah, this, that's just like Charlie goodnight's. That's a great, great like institution of a club. You know, you're a skeptic. I wonder if you took a, the wood from an old comedy clubs had been laughed. There was just, it did the, absorbed all the waves of laughter through the years. What that would be different than say the woods asked us actual on the actual pod, Cuban music, which just get to start. I should already start. Let's go teaser question, teaser question. I dragged everything from on and on.

Speaker 2:          00:13:56       Experience. Joe Rogan podcast. Hello. My friends were talking to, um, the Great Brian Cowen, who'll be a Charlie goodnight's this weekend in North Carolina. If you're listening to this live or within the next couple of days. And then we're also talking to the Midwest. Midwest is a guy who, uh, came onto my podcast or on my television show rather than the Scifi, uh, Joe Rogan questions, everything where we, uh, wanted to discuss a, a bunch of issues. And then I found out that he has a website that is devoted entirely to debunking things. I had known about your website before. Contrail science as it contrasts science.org or.com.com. I read that. Write this down. Contrail contrail science and it's very, uh, it's very detailed and very easy. The way it explains what certain are misconstruing

Speaker 1:          00:14:53       for being poisonous spray that's coming out of planes and what's actually an effect of jet airplanes flying through clouds and that explanation. I remember reading that going, oh, that totally makes sense. Like I get it. They're seeing it come out of the plane and they think that this has never happened before or that this is a, this is a new thing. This is geoengineering. They're spraying over ahead. They're not telling us about it. And the [inaudible] want to think that it's a geoengineering that's like the big one, that they're geoengineering.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       That's the main explanation that people

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       and what's geoengineering, here's what's fucked, what's fucked as they are, try to cool the planet. I mean, it's not that they're doing it on purpose, but we are doing it by flying and making those clouds. It is geoengineering eyes. And one of the things that I really enjoy about what you're doing is that you have a very specific sort of mandate and the idea is to expose these silly ideas so that you can concentrate on real ones. You know? And when you were talking about chem trails, one of the things that really struck me was that was that how much time and effort is spent on things that can be debunked and how they really just distract from things like the NSA tapping into all your emails and being able to monitor anyone's phone if those are like real issues.

Speaker 3:          00:16:18       Yeah. Like, and the people who are into chem trails and things like that, a lot of them are very energetic people who yes, they spend a lot of time doing this stuff and they could be spending that time on a, on real issues.

Speaker 1:          00:16:30       Yeah. And it's not that this is the big one, it's not that no one has ever experimented on the public before. The fucking for sure they have. We know about the Tuskegee experiment, we know that they, they sprayed that shit out of the top of buildings in Saint Louis. We know that they've experimented with things that probably weren't the healthiest for the population. But when you start calling everything you see in the clouds, a conspiracy and everything, you see when a jet engine passes through it without like really looking into the possible details of it like that, it gets, it gets to be almost like a religion. It is.

Speaker 3:          00:17:05       Yeah. It is. Yeah. I think that that's, you know, people, they have that same, that faith basically, that, uh, you know what they believe is correct and they didn't actually need the evidence to back that up. So if you're asked them, you know, where's the evidence? They say it's obvious, and they just say, look up at the sky. Uh, they, they, you know, it's like people who have religious experiences, they, they pray to God and God tells them that they are right. Uh, people in the chem trail community, a lot of people in the country and community have this, this, this religious sense of being very, um, very, um, sure about their ideas. And they have basically gone beyond evidence. Now the, in the post evidence stage, a lot of them about how, you know, the, the, the time for proving chem trails he's passed because, you know, we, we know it's happening, it's obvious. So it's very difficult to deal with those people to, to talk to them because they don't want to listen to the evidence that are moving onto the next day.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       Aren't you describing a fanatic in a sense? I mean, well, they are fanatical in their belief, but the idea that there's no, I can no longer be challenged. The, the, the debate has been settled and now it's just a question of whether you, you, you are a convert or you are an enemy. I mean, that's kind of the idea.

Speaker 3:          00:18:22       Yeah. So for those type of people, I tried to frame the discussion a bit differently. Uh, you need to ask them like what would be the next stage and you're not going to start shooting down planes or even though some people do actually to to just talk about shooting downplay. And so I've got a whole long thread on the forum of people who, you know, say things like, let's shoot him down. There's people who actually do go out with laser pointers and point them at the planes that are chem trails.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       Here's my problem with it all and this is what really freaked me out. What, where is, where's their tipping point? Like how far do you look into it before you willing to resort to violence? Like how much evidence are they getting that that's what's happening? There's a weird disconnect going on here because if you were looking at the whole thing and if you looked at the explanations and you looked at the explanations where they're clearly stating in mainstream news that there's, there's artificial clouds that are created by jets. It's a part of the 2002 article on cnn.com. And it's about after nine 11, they measured the skies and they found that the artificial clouds that are created by jets flying around all the time that they actually were cooling the planet, the planet got hotter like a measurably hotter without that

Speaker 3:          00:19:39       during the day. It actually, uh, well it, it's when that happened, it to warmed up during the day and killed down during the night. Uh, the, the jets don't actually really do one thing very much. They do in the day they, uh, the, the controls or block the sun and at night they block the heat leaving, right? So the net result is a very slight warming because there's more of an effect from the trapping of the thing at night. So during the nine 11 shutdown, uh, what was seen was there was, uh, an increase in the range of temperatures.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       So my, my point was that it is still is a fascinating point of discussion. Even if it's not chemicals being sprayed from the sky, even if it is this, not, excuse me, even if it is not this nefarious government scheme to control the weather. Yeah, it is still fascinating and because we're, we're having an effect on the environment by, by flying around period. So in a sense the, the idea behind chem trails like the chem trail theorists and conspiracists, the, what they're doing is you're, you're, you're, you have a real problem and you're focusing on a fake ineffective problem and the fake ineffective problem being that they're spraying as to poison us, they're causing more Johns what an incredibly ineffective program that would be. Do you know how much money the government is spending? How would you even organize that in the government as if you could keep that a secret as if the US government could keep something like that secret anyway. I mean just stop and think about how crazy it is that you would think that something which does such a shit job is still going on as a program. We're pretty goddamn healthy. People are living longer than ever. The cure cancers that used to kill you just a few years ago. It's like if you're taking care of your body and you're eating healthy, if you can afford to do that, you can live pretty good right now.

Speaker 4:          00:21:25       Yeah, and that's one of the things like with fluoride in the water, people say Florida is it's poisoning people, but you know the water's being fluoridated for for decades and there really hasn't been any, any noticeable differences in health of people.

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       That is Laurie and fluoride, but there also hasn't been any evidence to indicate that fluoride is good for, for dental hygiene or anything. It's a bit of a gps thing to like it should be poured into the water period. Right? If it's not aiding in, in taking away anything dangerous

Speaker 5:          00:21:55       science. The fact that Florida actually does retard tooth decay, but I do not know if that's true because the reason I say that is because they've done a lot of comparisons between, the reason, first of all, I think it was even discovered was wasn't it? There was a couple of towns in Colorado where kids were just not getting cavities. Well, what was going on? They found that there were a natural fluoride deposits in there in the water and it may have been, I think it was Colorado. And then, uh, then they started doing things and scientist said yes. In fact a fluoride ref makes it more and more unlikely that you'll get tooth decay and then they compared fluoride this country with the countries overseas that did not far dies. They're fluff fluorinate or whatever the word is there, their water. And there was a market difference in, in

Speaker 4:          00:22:37       it is the science is real, that it does actually prevents it. But it's, it's kind of a more of a broader demographic thing. Like for the total population, does it actually have a, a worthwhile effect? Cause most people brush their teeth nowadays with fluoride toothpaste. Yeah. Uh, and back in the olden days, that wasn't a common thing, especially with poor people. And so the floor reduction programs, but kind of aims more at the poor people who, who had poor dental hygiene and you know, the middle classes and upper middle class, it's people who had money and taught the kids how to brush their teeth properly. They didn't really benefit from fluoridation at all. And nowadays it's a lot more common for people to be brushing their teeth. So there's even less of a reason to do it. But there still is the, there's still a segments of the population who don't have very good dental hygiene who probably would benefit from fluoridation, but you know, it's like math. And

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       so is it a necessary component for, for dental hygiene or is it just that hygiene is a necessary component. And then if you were having a person who's doing it today, over the last x amount of years, toothpaste has been fluoridated. What s what sample study do you have of people that are not using fluoride? Uh, you know, as forward it to the Amish, the Amish. I may maybe like,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       I'm, I have that Tom's of Maine, I've had that stuff before. It doesn't have Florida and it's pretty good toothpaste, just because it kind of, it kind of weirds me out that fluoride is dangerous. I mean, you can't, you can't have it enlarged psalms. And obviously you could say that about salt or a lot of other things as well. But Florida doesn't seem to be like a natural thing that we should consume. I mean, is, is there, it is a natural occurring, uh, can be in the water. All water, like a natural spring water. It's a mineral, isn't it? Or is it a, yeah, something like that. So it comes from that. If you die from fluoride, you're pretty big pussy though.

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       What was the, uh, the knock, the conspiracy theorists? Maybe you can help us on this. The conspiracy theory about it was a, that it was created by the Nazis that they, uh, it was a part of the mind control effort to keep people stupid. They, Florida, Florida, the water, I mean, the Internet was vetted on, I have a lot of those people were probably at apple were and et cetera. We're doing, we're drinking far. I like, I can't hear you. Gotta you gotta look at the, yeah. What's happened? How's it worked out? People stupid it nowadays you might. Yeah. A lot of people ask you to be noticed, but yeah, Iq is and how stupid. That's a terrible thing. I was thinking, we don't realize how stupid people are until you're running the stupid people, because if you're a smart person, he traveled in smart circles, you can get really delusional if you live in a nice town where people have their shit together and you're, you know, interacting with pretty intelligent people.

Speaker 2:          00:25:10       You could forget that. Essentially this parts of the world, parts of our country, even that looked like an episode of the walking dead. Yeah. You know, and that's it. I didn't even think of it as stupid when I travel as much as you know, we both travel a lot. I actually am always amazed at how apathetic people are, just how they just are not interested in anything that they can't eat or touch or feel. There's no, there's no, it doesn't always seem to be a lot of imagination out there. Yeah. There's a weirdness to this world that we're living in right now where people are looking to be distracted more so than ever. Partly partly because you can distract yourself very effective. Yep, that's true too. But there's not that much of a push to get the fuck away from it. You know? I think that like, it sounds crazy, but I think that like if there's not some sort of a push to get away from stupid silly thinking, it's really difficult to find the motivation to take a, I think human beings have always done that when they had to write.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       Think about how many inventions came out of war out of the necessity of trying to beat the other side. So you're not specking said Dortch, et cetera. I mean, a lot of, a lot of invent, and correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot of technological advances were a direct result of having to come up with a solution to a problem or you know, a very immediate problem in the space program as well. Basically came out of the Cold War. It was this because we had this big enemies that we had to fight. Two, you can pull this resources into, you know, going to the moon and stuff like that, which was completely unnecessary thing. Um, but you know, guests conflict is a big driving force. Safety, safety and pleasure. This is an interesting cavity. Rates

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       declined in several cities that stopped war. I'd flow water fluoridation, new studies report contradicting American dental association predictions according to the fluoride action network, by the way, who the who are the floor, that's where the speed, you're dedicating all your time to flora obscure jobs as if this is a few fairly serious people who don't like the fluoridation thing. Like actual scientists. Yeah. Oh yes. That's the case behind it. It's not this totally French thing, but it becomes fringe when you get into things like know the government is adding it secretly. So to brainwash people. Or the other one that I've heard is that the government added it because there was some sort of a deal that they had made with the producers of fluoride. He's like less than say you're going to dump this and I want to hear, you're gonna pay us every year.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       So you got to kick back, you're going to kick back. Your kids are going to kick back. But it's ridiculous. It's a ridiculous theory. But it sounds like got something the government would do. We're trying to get rid of toxic waste and the only thing that could think of to do was to put it in the water supply. Yeah. I mean, who gets rid of toxic waste? But I didn't get to the water supply. I think the company that makes toxic wigs are in league with Satan. And uh, so as the government that allow this to happen, they don't care that they're washing their own bodies with this water and all the elites, if they're spring water shipped in from the center of the earth, comes sterilized by the lava. It's super delicious. And once you vote Republican for 10 years in a row, they come to your house.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       We'll give you the good water. Got to Switzerland and they have their blood to look clean. Yes. She got to go to Switzerland machines. We'll see. Do they do do some interesting procedures overseas? Do you know anything about like those blood splinting, spinning procedures are doing [inaudible]? Isn't that platelet rich sort of like that, but I guess it's not, it's there's something more to it. It's just not just platelet rich plasma treatment, but there's added elements. I have no idea. I don't understand it, but all these athletes are having these incredible results going over there. Like Dana White, he cured his maneuvers disease with one shot. He's really, yeah, apparently a lot of diseases are based on inflammation and what this stuff essentially is. What it creates is this super anti inflammation agent that's made out of your own blood and I don't understand the process at all, but apparently during the Bush administration it was really difficult to do stem cell research.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       Difficult to, difficult to get funding for a lot of things. And if anything that involves stem cells, even if it's like a tiny fraction of a bunch of cells, you know, like a hundred cells or something like that. Something so small you'd have to look at under a microscope to see it. So because of that, I think Europe was allowed to experiment with a lot of like really interesting different methods for using stem cells and, and different, different treatments of using the stuff that's made out of your own body, like taking your blood and turning it into Madison. It's really

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       kind of crazy. The idea that inflammation is like the cause of suddenly there was an article recently in New York Times about a guy with a physician who said, why are we not telling people about the benefits of low grid aspirin, 81 milligrams or something like that, which apparently has a very, very, uh, um, measurable results in, in stopping things like, uh, or at least retarding, uh, things like colon cancer, even, uh, all kinds of diseases because it, it brings inflammation down in the body. And uh, you know, just just look right at Aspen. Listen Dude, I'm reading Argo article right now on wake up world.com, and it says, prove to anyone that fluoride is bad for you and dumbing society down. Hmm. Did you imagine if we found out that our leaders were really pouring stuff in the water to try to make everybody dumb, but let's say that we're the delusion of ones and that these folks were all right and that is the elites.

Speaker 5:          00:30:38       They are not getting fluoride water and they're just doing it to dumb people down. That's the most extreme of the theories, right? Yeah. I guess just done at a local level though. It's not even like a national thing. The elites get a cut back. When people use words like the elite or the government, the government's always changing and there's so much infighting in the government. A lot of times people try to stab each other in the back. It'd be hard to kind of get a one small groups. The shelter, they also, yeah, they also need funding. I found the fluoride action network, by the way, Joe. Nice.

Speaker 5:          00:31:10       Those guys look really happy. That's one thing I always say when I see a gay guys to get the Tilex so it happened like so happy. They look happy. They're not conflicted at all. You know, gay. They don't, they don't have an issue of you being a woman. They also get to hang with another dude. How do you understand so well, why is this guy in this guy? No, he's too high. He's too tall. Look, he's peeing on his jacket off. He's using his butt cheeks to hold his balls and bliss. If I had to guess weird, if I had to go, I say fun. This, this, uh, and then the second theory is that there's some sort of a cover up going on because they sell this, they have a deal to sell this fluoride to the, to the water people and the water people put it in and this is kickback sort of a deal.

Speaker 5:          00:31:55       I've heard that theory to, can you read that? It's such a small amount of money in the global scheme of things like poisoning the, until I population just to make like $1 billion. Maybe he has one of those giant twisty mustaches like Tait Fletcher is rocking these days and he's really just like a surfer dude. Todd has the most glorious mustache. The world has ever known. Fantastic things. Everybody should have a mustache. Fuck that guy. Should I love that too. Shit. Toughest Shit. Sweet and smart and and and very smart. But he's a sweetie too. He's a really nice guy. He's just a sandwich. Maybe if he had fluoride in his water, anything a little more calm. I was going to say drinking too much fucking spring water. That's what happens. Peter though. If you can put salt

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Peter on the water and it actually kills boners prison. Really? This isn't that what they used to give priests? There was, I don't know. They said they gave her and I know they use it and I, from my own understanding, I guess I use it in prison. The priest take that stuff the way, like when you know a kidnappers trying to drug a woman and she figures out a way to put it under a tongue and a movie and spit the medication away. Defiantly. Yeah. That's how the priests take that. Saul, Peter, I saw Peter Tapping. Yeah. Who the fuck is going to take something that kills your boners and people would theoretically, but when push came to shove, they would go, wait, what? What does it do? You know, you'd go, yeah, I don't even want my sexuality anymore. I'm done. I give up and then, okay, well we're going to give you a pill that kills it permanently.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       Forever. I got it. I'll get to that pill. And you go, wait, what happens? I just sit on the couch all day. What else is there to do? My boner is what drives me everywhere. Um, did you see any of, uh, the, uh, Joe Rogan questions? Everything on, um, human optimization on a transcendence? No, that's the one I mentioned. That's literally the best one in my opinion. My, my, my favorite one to do because, uh, it was on a very controversial topic. The idea of taking a human mind and breaking it down to ones and Zeros and then downloading it into something that we create. Singularity. Yeah. Whether it is computer or whether it's an artificial body that you know has an artificial brain and like literally like a bolt to the back of your head and your, your Usb to Usb in your brain and all sudden Brian Callen exists in a super body because you're running around jumping over buildings and you're not even made out of tissue anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       You made out of carbon fiber and then I'll finally have the athleticism. I think everyone's going to be at some point in time, but that is the big, uh, the big theory is how much of this is science fiction or the big discussion rather is how much of this is science fiction because the idea of being able to add escape, escape your biologic 100% right? Yeah. And to be able to, to, to get the mind and somehow know, transport the consciousness into something else. Maybe there's no one has ever shown. Yeah, we, no one's ever shown that we can even isolate where consciousness comes from. We know that, you know, we believe it's created by the brain because of a bunch of factors. But the brain could be just like a really sophisticated instrument for tuning in the consciousness of your entire body. Well, or the way that these mathematicians are now calling, uh, the idea that our brain may very well be a hologram. Uh, what we see as a mathematical hologram of some kind. This guy had on my podcast as an author, went and talked to all these big time, uh, mathematicians at MIT because he was trying to work on this book. And they, they were like, well, I mean, the latest theory if you really want to hear it, is that this is one big hologram and you're, you were

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       actually, there's a another dimension to our minds that we haven't thought about yet. I was like, what are you talking about? What are you even saying? But it was, you know, this is all these guys done numbers too. That's what's really fucked about those theoretical quantum physicists guys. They'll show you like in numbers. Well, they said that that this is where they started with, they said if you were to take all the space away from what's what you're made of, say you're made of atoms and it's mostly space and energy. If you were to take the space away from that, from every human being in every, every piece of material, you could fit every human being that's ever lived in side of baseball. And then they started going, well, if that's the case, then there's gotta be a mathematical explanation for this theoretically, which would mean that this is some kind of a Hologram, et Cetera, et cetera. Leave it up to these mathematicians. You know, you're just got to the point when you start getting that high math stuff, it doesn't weigh more fascinating, right? It's like the, it's a mathematical model of how

Speaker 4:          00:36:33       universe might work, but it doesn't tell you anything about reality cause there's nothing, any of that you can test it just saying behind the curtain there might be this, but there's no way of looking behind the curtain. Right. There's this like with, you know, stupid strength theory. You can't really test it yet because it's based on these like tiny little dimensions in the, in, in underneath atoms and things like that. So it's kind of like a little bit meaningless. Sure.

Speaker 5:          00:36:53       Although wouldn't you say, and I've heard that there, there have been mathematical equations that were thought up 150 years ago by random mathematicians and it really had no bearing on the physical world. A hundred years later, 130 years later. Oh look, I'm measuring the distance between quarks and how they relate to such and such. And in fact this equation is incredibly applicable. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:37:13       Some types of math, like people thought there was no use for it at all. Like you mentioned to me numbers, the square root of minus one is an imaginary number. It's not a real number. Uh, uh, they, they didn't have any use back in the day. They're just Newtonian mechanics. But now quantum mechanics uses imaginary numbers in the math.

Speaker 5:          00:37:29       That's what blows my mind is the fact that, fuck, did you just say that? And that's what blows my mind because in math, oh my God, I'm so stupid yet there yet they're practical. Yet they haven't applied practical application to, to reality now because these, these quantum scientists, the, when they're dealing on the quantum level, it actually, it's actually relevant and that's what fascinates me is somebody thinks up an incredible mathematical equation a hundred years ago for no reason and Lo and behold, he thought it up and we're using it today because it reflects the physical world. Just been a whole history of mathematics that most people are completely ignorant to me. Absolutely. I, but I have read articles where people who are mathematical geniuses were describing like breakthroughs and Mac mathematics and they look at it like, see people look at baseball. They look at it like people look like the great sports heroes of the past. Like great mathematicians. It's like there's like this weird sort of comradery, this a culture of these super people that are just concentrating on numbers. So fucking freaky

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       thing. They're in their own little world because they've got this language that only they can talk. They talk to other mathematicians about things. So you're talking about like, I was on the bus once a back in England and there's two guys behind me and they were talking about 24 dimensional sphere packing. And it started out, they said, well, 24 dimensional spear packing. And then after that I couldn't understand a single word that they said. It was just this complete gobbledygook

Speaker 5:          00:38:56       good. There's a great, NPR did an amazing documentary on this mathematician who's name escapes me. He was, they were just honoring him, all these mathematicians around the world. And they talked to this famous mathematician and he said, oh, he was a saint. And a guy goes, what? He goes, he was a saint, there's no other way to put it. And he said, what do you mean? He said, his, his influence on all of us was so profound because what he would do was he would find out that there was a mathematician somewhere in the world working on a very complicated problem. And he would show up at their door and say, he would show up at the door and say, uh, hello, uh, my name is such and such and I'm here to lend you my brain in any way I can. And he would help the guy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:34       And I know it's so brilliant though. Image of you in middle jerking off and that guy and knocking on the door wants to play with numbers. What the fuck are you buddy? I don't even know each other. Get outta here. Get outta here. Where you crazy mass kill. He would come up with weird ideas that he'd see a hawk flying overhead and he'd say, and he'd calculate the amount of the globe that the Hawk was able to see at any given time or, or when or if or if it flew for 60 minutes and he would come up with these incredible answers where you go, that's actually kind of it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:06       What's really fascinating is how little attention we put to that, but yet what a huge impact it has on the reality of our world as opposed to celebrities having babies. Oh Em Gee, Alec Baldwin freaked out on that. Photog can you believe that? No, I can't believe it. A Guy, he's got a temper and there's a bunch of dudes standing in front of him when he was with his baby taking pictures. Yeah. I wonder why he went crazy. Yeah. I wonder why he went after them. That's not nearly as bizarre as the whole picture. Look at this world of mathematics that allows this person to make this camera look at this super genius had figured out how to get this chip and break this computer down to this tiny little sensor and figuring out how to, and it's all digital and you fucking can use your finger to flip through the images and it's this huge thing. It just captures everything crystal clear. That's, that's Matt. That's craziness. Hot Chick, isn't it in a way, but, but the, the main impact of it is this massive distraction of celebrity gossip.

Speaker 3:          00:41:08       Okay, cool. Shit. Because that's immediate and visceral that anyone can relate to it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:13       I know, but it's weird how people can relate to a metric to track shiny. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's amazing how all, I mean if you looked at like our pie chart of what what we, uh, pay attention to in the world and showed math, it would be so small. It was this little tiny slip out of us. Think about sex and food

Speaker 6:          00:41:34       and music. Your music sucks. Fucking Twitter assholes on Twitter. You know, again, isn't Twitter the mechanism by which you do it? It's an algorithm probably who wasn't the algorithm. This is all man. It's all benefit for sure. And it's with the Internet would be impossible if it wasn't for the matter.

Speaker 3:          00:41:48       The lack of math kind of underlies a lot of the conspiracy theories out of that because people don't, they have this stopping point that they can't get beyond because at some point you've got to do a little bit of math to check your, your science or your theory or whatever it is, right? Like with light, the chem trail thing like Giddy, you get this angles and geometry and stuff like that, but people, you know, they stopped because they can't do that. And with other things like we'll trade center collapsed. There's and things like that. There's a bit of math to do there, but the vast majority of people can never get past that mental barrier of having to do a bit of math.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       Yeah, well the math of how many people would have to be in on it is a big one. I mean you're not talking about like people always like to use the Manhattan project as a good example of people being able to keep a secret for a long time, but boy is that a different sort of situation, boys at a different time in the world? Yeah, wartime before social internet, before a social networking programs that we enjoy today that allow you to know that Tommy Morrison died today and let you get immediately, instantly that ride. It's going to say it's very hard to get information to people that, oh, it comes, it comes so rapid right now. It's just, it's hard to believe that they would be able to keep that a secret. That's, that's one thing and then it's hard to see the benefit. Like what's what's actually being done here?

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       People being what, who's actually getting hurt because of this? Like how many more diseases? And we really looked at the numbers. What is, what does the MPO, oh, actually, we're healthier now than ever before. So what, what are we actually looking at here? What are we, we're looking at here. It's like this, this very blinder edge look of the world where you're, you're just choosing to focus on one aspect of something that you're seeing and consumes our lives as well. The picture spreads into everything. Yeah. It's a, it's almost a philosophy. It's, uh, there's, there's a philosophy to skepticism and there's a philosophy to cynicism and I think they're different things. And I think a lot of people look at skeptics, skepticism and cynicism as being equal. And I don't think they're eating a little,

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       I have a bit of a problem with, like, I used the word debunker. Uh, rather than skeptic. A skeptic kind of just implies all you're little, you don't believe in stuff, but debunkers an active thing. You're actually going out there and trying to do something about it. But people think that debunk has I just automatically disbelieving everything which work, which is not what not work. Debugging is about. It's about finding things that are wrong and then exposing them, not starting out. Assuming yes.

Speaker 6:          00:44:10       Isn't that, isn't that the scientific method isn't skepticism and doubt what is always the scientist is always got to prove. Yeah, absolutely. I always keep doubt in his mind. Right? So you have to be skeptical as a, as a scientist think the anti science people, they think that science is a dogma that's fixed. Whereas completely opposite

Speaker 3:          00:44:28       sciences is constantly changing and constantly correcting it or all is doing

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       basically it's finding the things that still are not known in science. And what I really like about what you, the way you do it is you're not making any enemies while you're doing it. You know, you're, you're being nice about it. You're being very calm about it. When you were in the face of incredible stupidity when uh, when we did our show and that guy was creating his is fucking cloud machine was goofy fake harp thing. That wasn't even really hard. It was like he is attaching an electricity to this box and sending a current through it and he had artificial like those MREs for those a bonsai things that you see at the mall. There's always looked out but you never buy one. You know those bonsai trees always look sweet like Mac bonds actually in my office, but shit, they make noise to Gurgle, Gurgle, shyness saw the original bonds I the ones that have four or 500 years old.

Speaker 5:          00:45:19       I was a kid, I never forgot that I went to mainland China and they're tiny and they're four or 500 yards yard. Oh there are my God hear them. They had some that were 700 year old trees that were still tiny and they were exactly like a 700 a hundred year old oak or something and they were, I couldn't get over it. I was probably, how old was I? I was 15 years old. I couldn't stop staring at, so they're just constantly manicuring yeah, there's that. There are people who pass their gender, their skill to generation after generation and they raised these, these trees and they're bonsai trees. And Wow, that's amazing. That's another thing, man. It's like we, we have it in our heads so much that this is the way culture is like America, like this is it. Like this is like one possibility that a pattern can get started and then it follows.

Speaker 5:          00:46:08       It becomes a tradition. Then it becomes your culture and then it becomes the way you behave. And they're radically different. I mean boys like girls, girls like boys, sometimes girls like girls, sometimes boys like boys. Other than that it's all bets are off. People they have their, their writing is fucking incredibly alien that driving on the wrong side of the street. They have all sorts of things. The you except as like being like normal to you. They're like, like, like they white, they wipe their ass with their left hand. Like you can't touch a dude's left hand. Right. The Guy I had, the guy I had on just, I'm about to have my podcast Josh for, I just did an interview with him and he has been living in the Congo with hunter gatherers, the original, the final, probably one of the last very last people and the deep Congo forest with pygmies.

Speaker 5:          00:46:55       They're all pygmies. They come up, toss guy comes up to his shoulders and he had Justin wren on the podcast, who's, you know who he is, he's on the ultimate fighter and now he's dedicated his entire life to help him pygmies. He goes back and forth there and makes films. It makes me wonder if Josh knows and Josh Board, but I bet they do. I'll just pick me, help her dudes and asked him. I asked him, what's this scary, but he was just talking about it. He was talking about progress and he said the one thing we don't die of his stupid diseases, thank God for vaccines and antibiotics and stuff and, and there's a lot of death. Uh, but he said, but then he was talking about how for the most part they smoke I shit load of weed by the way. Ah, yeah. And the pygmies always high, always hot and they spent a lot of time, they actually, there's a lot of food around so they're prime murmur.

Speaker 5:          00:47:37       Merrily carnivores that eat some roots and they different nuts. But um, but there's enough food around and they have a lot of time to hang out and said, what are they doing? It's just a lot of times they'll just watch their kids run around and play. I was like, I said, what's the most dangerous animal? Like a, you know, snakes. He goes, no, no, not snakes. You don't have to worry about it. It's just elephants. I was like, what do you mean? He goes, elephants in the, and you always sneak up on them by accident and they just come at you and God, that's must be so terrifying and intelligent. Giant animal that's to there. This, Justin Wren, when the first time of these kids had ever seen a white guy before, and Justin's a big giant white guy with really light skin. Wow. They're freaking out.

Speaker 5:          00:48:18       Justin has red hair, right? It's like reddish brown brown. Good on you. Justin wren. Good on you. He's a little ginger. Oh, he's a great guy. He's a real sweetheart. And uh, he said that this really gave his life a lot of meeting and he just feels completely dedicated to these people. Know that those kids, they're so sweet. They're, well, he just exploded the way you explained it was very pure, you know, that he wouldn't, when he went over there and he started helping these people, like he had this massive sense of helping, you know, that he could help, that he could accomplish something, that he could really make an impact. I asked Josh, I said, you know, you see a lot of death and that people die and, and one of the things that, one of the things that modern, I think society has given us is we have to bury our children a lot less frequently than we did.

Speaker 5:          00:48:59       Just 50 years ago. Thank God. And I said, one, when someone, you know, people who are on such an intimate terms with life and death with a lot of people die all the time. Uh, how do they deal with death? And he looked at me, he said, people are just people, man. And they take death just as heavily as any of us do, regardless of how frequent it happens. It's always, you know, a soul crusher. I'm sure that we had this tendency to believe, well, you've been around it a lot and they just accept the fact that that's a part of reality. But the, the impact of it father losing their son or mother losing or whatever, it's, it's incredibly painful. It's always going to be, it's one of the main motivating factors that people have to succeed and to shelter themselves correctly and to keep food on the table. You know, you're never going to avoid that. It's pulling America. There'll be sheltered from, from death, I think. Yeah, absolutely. It was spoiled.

Speaker 3:          00:49:47       One theory about the waterways, the FEMA coffins, uh, which is great liners. There's big piles of grave liners in the field somewhere. People say that the coffins, that FEMA has been stockpiling a, but they're really just like these plastic things that they put it up of grapes. But you know, cause people aren't familiar with, you know, they don't go to very many funerals because again, very few people die over the course of your life until you get to be older. All the young people I had, they don't recognize these things cause they don't know anything about the burial process. So they think, oh it must be like FEMA slot behind coffins.

Speaker 5:          00:50:16       Yeah. And they'd probably listen to Alex Jones. That wasn't Alex Jones thing. Camps coffins lined up. You're telling me West,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I have been to the FEMA camps. That was good. There's 10,000 body holds out there. Boy, I want to hear him hitting on a girl, Joe Rogan. Joe Rogan is one of the most underrated impressionist show. If it's Alex Jones or Joey's the is and Mike Tyson. You do a great Mike Tyson. I haven't done that one a long time. You do a very good Mike Tyson. You do a great Arnold. Thank you very much. You're sweetie. But I am um, what, uh, what owes the, we sort of got a little bit sidetracked with a Brian's awesome story of pygmies. Sorry. It's pretty bad out. Don't sorry. It was pretty bad ass. But what I was getting to was that, um, you, you don't, you don't make any enemies when trying to see it, but you can't help it sometimes because people will take just the fact that you are explaining where they were wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       Right. As being, you telling them they asked stupid. Yes. But I would tell them they're stupid. That's my point. It's like you do so much better job. Just so much better for this job than me because as a comedian that was, it's a real problem with like even doing this Joe Rogan questions, anything show or everything show, because there was certain point in times where as a comedian, I couldn't just have you stand in front of me. Tell me you've seen something completely retarded with no emotion attached to it. You know, I just like, Oh really? Oh you did. Oh did ya fucking wasting my time. Especially asshole. I look, I try to be really nice. As much as I can get a lot better, I got a lot better cause he used to be when you were younger, Joe would just be like, what? That's stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:51:55       I'm not talking to anymore. I knew there's, there's things that can happen in this life that can really hold you up and one of them, one of the things that can complicate and fuck your life up to no end is when you make the mistake of allowing really stupid people into your life because really stupid people that not thinking about themselves, they're not thinking about you. They're just thinking about filling holes, whether it's emotional holes or psychologicals and they're not. They're not really even there for you. I wish you had learned that they're everywhere. They're like poisonous plants that look like the real thing. It's like if, if you, you like it, there was a certain smell that salary gave off and if you ate it, it just breaks your Dick, gives you diarrhea, it gives you headaches or six months. You would avoid that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:36       Like the play. Well, but that is the case with relationships. It's the case with friendships. It's the cast case with relationships and at, when I was young I felt like I was fighting up river. I felt like those motherfuckers, these weak dummies that will get in your life and make up stories and lie or be mean to you or shit on you or say things about you behind your back, they're your enemy. So it comes to that go through. Cause I still learned that and I never did nobody. Yeah, I just figured that out. Well it wasn't entirely right. I she's like create a lot of enemies that didn't need to be my enemies. There was a much more levelheaded way of looking at it. But that took, for me at least it took some, I had a, I had to develop that understanding on my own. I had a developed understanding or like when to do it, when to not, when to be kind to people and when to like

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       try to genuinely let someone know that you can't listen to this anymore. You know, like, listen, I just, I'm sure you're a nice guy, but here this is my take on this and this is why I don't like discussing these things. Whereas if I was 23 I would have been like, dude, please shut the fuck up. You're killing my brain. You fucking dummy. Don't you didn't see the Shit I had to do that. A couple of people will fucking beat you down. They will beat you down with stupidity. They will climb inside your head and just say a bunch of stupid shit out you. And if you allow, if you venture into that world, you're going to be hanging around with problems to solve where you get nowhere. You're life is not going to be like figuring out your life. Your life is going to be dealing with whatever emotional bullshit these morons in your life have dragged into it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       And instead of like supporting each other and helping each other and evolving together, you're in this constant weird stream of conflict with the person that you're friends with. Ab think he's mad at me, man. I don't know what the fuck I did, but you know he's got a bug up his ass lately. Like you know those types of people and they start conflicts and then hey, Bobby thinks you're mad at him. I mean I don't know where you want to do that. What is all that? What is, where's that coming from? This is a pro. You get, you let that shit into your life, you got problems and people date that too. Exactly. In relationships where they, where they're having text wars for three hours. It's really simple. Don't be a cunt. Don't be a [inaudible] zone. Yeah, don't be a con. And we could all be nice to each other, but as soon as you allow continuous, and this motherfucker was, he had a whole cunt farm.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       He had a hole cut, a hole, cut produce section and he was just, he had all of these constant, he was growing in his life all over the place. The point, we'd be constantly late for things because he would always have like 15 different obligations at some asshole that he was hanging out with. Dude, dude, I really need you to have for me, brother. I really need you there for me. This is my thing. You know? Oh, this is my first time in acting class where I'm standing up, but I'm doing like, and you would go to these idiots think you would go to all those things and then you would come to me afterwards. He was like, you got to clean your life outside. You got to clean your life out. You hanging around with way too many crazy assholes. Exhausting. That was the best compliment you ever gave me.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       He said you never needed anything. Right. I think that's why you hung out with me a lot, right? Cause I just didn't need anything from you. Oh, you look one of my most Leeton least needy friends I've ever met. Nothing. You need nothing. When I'm first met, you didn't even have a fucking door knob. I didn't have a door knob. He was living in Venice in a fucking apartment. I go upstairs. Uh, this is his place. I pushed the door open. I'm looking down. There's no, there's no knob. It's a whole. You could look down on your knees and look right into his apart. I father, I said that to me. My father saw the car was driving. That goes, hey, he goes up, I can afford to buy you a nicer car you want me to do. I'll do it right now. I was like, man, I'm all right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       Now what I recognize when I met you was this guy who is like almost like you're trying to save people from the thing that you would be. You would least like you're to find yourself in that sort of a position. I think that's good. You were, you were looking at them. If they were you and you didn't feel entirely secure growing up and you felt like as a good person that you are, you would just cha cha, try to help these guys out. He's a good guy, just got a bath. He's got a crazy idea project for me yesterday. The idea of how and bring them in otherwise, but the beautiful thing about you do this, first of all, we never argued about these things. Like when you had a crazy person in your life, you were more than willing to listen you you like we disagreed about a few of them but you never got like shitty about it and I think you're a really logical thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       You always have been and so like you looking back on all your behavior so fascinating because you're looking at it like a science project. Like oh this is why I was doing this here and this is why it was a silly goose right there and right. The amount of time I wasted just just buying two parrots and having two dogs and moving a complete lunatic into my house. You know, I just, I would like, let's see, well let's see. Everything's going well. Let me see how I can complicate the shit out of this. Maybe I can buy a chimp while I'm at it. You know, it just, you do, you do a lot. It's a lot of, it's just self sabotage in a way. It is, but that the logical thinking that you have it, what's fascinating about it and how it applies to debunking things and you've always been really good at that or really a energetic about it, you know, um, is that when you have like this way of thinking that you sort of cultivated over a lifetime of watching people fuck up left and right around you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       You can sometimes see other people's problems better than you can even see in your own. And so you see that and he'd go, oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's this. You're looking at this like, it's like, well, what you really want to be do? It's like turn inward and figure out why the fuck you're doing the weird shit that you're doing and your life in the first place. And once you started doing that, your life completely turned around. You got rid of all the cuckoo heads in your life and then your career started taking off and then you realize, oh, I was distracting myself and that was holding me back. Wow. I didn't know. What I find most fascinating about that when it, when you, when you apply that to like debunking is that there's no god damn guidebook to living life. And when you're going through life and you're trying to figure the whole thing out and trying to be a good person and trying to follow the laws and succeed and get ahead, nobody really can tell you how the fuck to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       And a lot of times people feel like there's forces holding them down. There's a lot of times people feel like, man, if I was just in with that crowd, then I would know if I was just with the hell. It's all nepotism, it's all the, it's, it's a crazy scary system that we're filtering our bodies through. That's what it really is. And so there's a lot of perceived shit out there that's really internal shit and that's one of the issues. It's causing people to look at whatever it is that they want to believe is real. Whatever crazy area, 51 conspiracy theory they want to pull all their time into like why are you really doing that? Is it really because the evidence is overwhelming or is there a psychological issue at stake here? Is there something going on that you're trying to not think about?

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       Is that what's causing you? And you know what, most of them admit it's the great demise. Most of them are met. It's a midlife crisis thing. They were honest about it. Really. A big foot guys. And I went out, went, cause it gives me space, part of this small community of believers. Well, the big foot guys were super cool and really nice guys. And one of the things the guy said, they were really fun. Like they weren't dumb. They're just really fun, interesting guys who believe in Sasquatch and they're like going and looking for him. But the guy was like, even if it's not real or camping. Yeah. And it was any hint joy man. He enjoyed it. He was a cool guy. Yeah. And Randy talked about modern art, uh, enthusiasts. So they'd come and see Rauschenberg, like a, a broom in a, in a bucket. And he'd sell it for $200,000 and she said, they're not here for art than I even heard. They are here to be part of a very small elite group of people that actually can quote unquote appreciate such as such sort of obscure expression. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       I think there's a big difference though between like big foot and say Cantrell's in nine 11. Because if you're, if you're wrong about bigfoot, there's no no big deal. You just like, you know, weren't right but big foot. But if you're wrong about nine 11 or chem trails, then your entire world view comes crashing down. So I think people are much more invested mentally in things like the most serious conspiracy theories and the origin, the supernatural and things.

Speaker 1:          01:00:58       Yeah, I do believe your ride being invested mentally is a great way to put it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       It works. This works both ways as well. Like debunkers and skeptics. Some of them get kind of obsessed with a, with deep on King and people start out, like as young people, young people debunking, they uh, uh, they just knock things down one at a time. They see something that's wrong and they're not stupid or like, you know, Oh, let me explain that. And they're not really, they're not really being very productive. And that's something I thought about a lot as as I've been doing it for more and more years, is you couldn't figure it out. You know, what's the, what's the long term goal here? Just like telling one guy that he's wrong and explain to one guy, he's not really very useful, but if you couldn't look at what you're actually doing and try to improve the way you're communicating with with these people and try to reach a broader set of people than just doing it as a sport, which is kind of what a lot of people who are skeptics do, they do it because they enjoy it. They get this, this visceral thing like, yeah, this year from proving, proving people wrong,

Speaker 1:          01:01:58       that creates a competition sort of feel. Yeah. And it creates a lot of animosity and that's what I was really crediting with you, that you do a great job of avoiding that. You just talked to them like extremely rationally. I mean, the guy that we were talking about that did this harp experiment seemed like a nice guy. Yeah, he did. This is, this is how easy, it seemed like a very nice guy. I really enjoyed his company. It not, I'm not a bad guy

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       at all. And he's obviously a smart guy too. Um, but his friend, when I go into his office, I walk in the door, they have a picture of this Indian guy, he's got a white beard and he's got white paint on his face and he's, uh, he's kind of a, a portly fellow, like a and a, I go, who's that guy? And he goes, well, 10 years ago he underwent an incredible transmogrification or some shit like that of his body, and now he no longer needs water or food. And I go, oh, he didn't rent the Tarion. Yeah, exactly. And I just go, no, he didn't. And he goes, no, you really have to meet up. I go, no, I don't. No, I don't. I can't. But that's where, that's where everything shuts down. Like I have to go stop. There's never been a person, they've even proven to be able to survive a week. Do you know that without a week with no water and no food, you're gone, son. You can't live active. Figured that out. Like you're not magic, right?

Speaker 5:          01:03:16       You fucking fat shit white paint on your face, that outrageous. You think the burden of proof would be on them? I mean that you can't just say that to me. He said you have to meet him. The I'm, I'm denying meeting him because I'm a government chill and a, that's the whole reason why we can't prove to the world on Joe Rogan questions. Everything that there are real breadth of Tarion's. Right? You get the fuck out of here. God Damn it. It's like there's not, there's not elves to what I would like it to be Elvis. It's like I watched this guy reading is great. You had a loved it and there's that. We're at this cafe and this beautiful girl is there and there's this guy, this middle aged guy, and he's reading her palm and clearly he is her healer or whatever. Oh yeah. And I just said I was with two other people and I go, that guy's, that guy's, oh, you want to see a scam artist right there, right there. There's a scam artist. Right. They're trying to get laid by reading her palm, and he was, he was obviously a professional like, you know, I could tell him about, he was talking, she was asking him questions. What does that mean? How do you know he's a scumbag? I go, because he's a liar. That's why he's making a living that way.

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       Well, you can just tell, you know, if you ever got your palm read, it's nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. They just start talking about your lifeline and you, what you went to here onto one of those places. It's open like 24 hours a day. It's just like the lady lives there and then you just ring the doorbell and she wakes up and it's so depressing. I went there once drunk with a friend. Oh, like God. I felt like I just woke up somebody at their house and now they're just, I have to talk to him. I went to one in New York. I was on my way to an audition. I had some time. I really didn't like acting back then anyway, and a saw, I went to this a Tarot card reader ladies place and uh, she was wrong about everything. I mean, could not be wrong. I don't even bother debunking stuff like that, I think. But it was beautiful. It was. It was because I never knew my grandmother was like always fancied herself a psychic. My, Oh yeah. My grandmother is completely crazy. Like Sylvia Brown makes $700 for, for 20 minute consultation. And my grandmother had a monkey is a big scam. She had a monkey. She rarely got a monkey. Yeah. Monkey's was cheeky. Monkey bite

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       everybody. Okay. She was the only way to get hold on to this monkey. That's so crazy. My grandmother was, she lived in a haunted house. Right. It was a haunted house because there was a dude, they were renting a room too, and the guy died and then he just kept showing up, you know, even after he was dead. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Weird House in North Ninth Street that they live, that they bought during the Italian period when all the immigrants were coming over. So they got it. Like when my grandfather was working for the factories are making the atomic bomb parts. Everybody was just talk about that, you know, grandpa makes it part. They using in the atomic bomb. I thought, wow, my grandpa's making the bomb. That's how fucking crazy people were back then. But uh, this house, this neighborhood, while they were living there constantly changed and got worse and worse and worse.

Speaker 1:          01:05:59       They did blockbusting they move people in and said, hey listen, black people are moving in. You better sell now. And they would sell up giant chunks of real estate at a fraction of what they're worth. Just through the scare tactics. And my grandfather was like, I like black people. I'm not going anywhere. And he stayed. And because of that, their, their, their whole neighborhood like completely changed and became really scary and dangerous like North Ninth Street right now where they leveled their house. They died a few years back, but it was a really bad neighborhood by the time they were gone. I'm like really bad. So, you know, a lot of people were seeing shit. What's that sound like? Fucking Christ on edge all the time. My grandmother already was crazy and she already had a monkey, you know, and if you are over that house, and I lived there for a while.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       When I first came to New York, I didn't have any money. And uh, I, when I got signed by my manager, I had to leave my apartment, uh, travel, uh, by car all the way to New York. And I didn't have enough money to save up for an apartment because I was only making like a couple hundred bucks a week. Right. Like doing gigs when I first moved to New York. So I stayed with my grandfather in this terrible neighborhood in North Ninth Street in Jersey, in Newark. And while I was there, you'd hear sirens in the middle of the night. The next door neighbor, they broke down his house with a battering ram cause he was selling crack. Yeah. The week, week or two weeks before I got there. This was all like fenced off. There's yellow tape and shit. It was like, it was crazy. That was his next door neighbor.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       It was, and he knew that that kid that became the drug dealer, he knew that kid from the time he was a baby. So he got to like experience this generational to becoming this, you know, 20 year old drug dealer with an Audi parked in his, uh, you know, like a little driveway area in, in Newark, unbelieving it talent. But it was, it was crazy, but you would feel like it was haunted cause it was just so dangerous. It was crackling. So everybody was always like, this house is haunted. And my grandmother was like, I knew that was gonna happen. She always, any other way the, it looks like I told Ted, scary old house. Kids will think it's haunted. And then you just say natural thing doing this, um, this show, the Joe Rogan questions, everything show I got to meet this guy bandit check who's a mentalist.

Speaker 1:          01:08:01       Did you, do you know what guys? Yeah. Holy Shit. Is this guy good? What do you mean mentalist? He, well, he tells you right away I'm bullshitting you. Okay. This is all tricks, but I'm going to show you how I tricked scientists and believing that I actually had psychic for four years and he did, I mean, he's a master mentalist who puts on shows like he entertains, like sort of like Penn and teller type style. Yeah. So dude, I had a dollar bill in my pocket. I pulled the dollar bill out. This is, we took coins, put them over his eyes. Okay. And then duct tape over the coins and I'm holding the dollar bill here and he's reading the serial number, the dollar bill that came from my pocket. I know where the dollar bill came from because it was an afterthought to put it in my pocket.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       I grabbed my keys and there was like a five and a one sitting next to my keys. I go, I'll let me get that too. And then I just stuffed it in my pocket and left the house. And so when he said, can you pull a bill out of your pocket? I knew the, it was a rare moment where I knew the exact, like the history of that dollar bill for the day. I knew he didn't get ahold of it. No one had placed it in my pocket. Maybe he sleight of hand in your pocket. You don't think I'd be able to feel a man's hands that close to my bedtime. Like a leopard, bro. You can't just touch me like that and touched me there. I watched a to what it was waging a hunting show me just say this right now, when you talk about leopard swimming and a deer got hit by an Arrow and deers are so fucking fast as the Arrow is going through its body, it turned to get away and so it wound up shooting through the top of its body. Yeah. Yeah. And these shows it in the video how it happened and he's like sometimes like deers, defy science. Unreal man. It's a magic bullet. But you read the serial number on the dollar. You were the serial number on my fucking dollar bill. I have no idea how he did it. He, he would, he did a bunch of different things like twisting a fork, but it's all tricks. He tells you. He's like, I am not magic. I don't have psychic powers. He goes, I'm just really good at tricking you.

Speaker 4:          01:09:55       Yeah. Well the good thing was when he did that, the scientists, he actually went into this scientific study with another guy, uh, for about Metta, several, several months. And there was these scientists who are trying to, there was studying ESP and they did all these tests on these two guys, but the two guys were actually the magicians that were bantered checking this other guy. And so they were basically fooling the scientists, the scientists, and you don't like writing these papers about these like amazing guys. And they did all these, these tests like where they would, they would seal things up. So there was no way that a, the check could actually get inside it, but he would figure out a way of getting inside the thing and like bending the wire then putting it back. So no one could tell because he's a magician. He knows like I have to get dodgy stuff like that. And he completely fill them for several months. And they were writing all these things in these academic journals about how that actually discovered ESP and how they'd been replicating it. But it was all this thing set up by, uh, by James Randy who was, uh, you know, he's really an old time skeptic. Go who debunked a Uri gala and people like that. I know that guy. Yeah. Yeah. We'll go with a beard.

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       Yeah. He's a fascinating cat. And um, the whole skeptic versus psychic movement or a debate is a very interesting one as well. I did, um, an episode we went to the Rhine Institute and we, you know, did all the uh, you know the Rhine Institute for Psychic Studies, something when it is, it's a, it's a really interesting setup where they have all these ancient methods that they used to use to try to figure out whether or not someone had psychic powers. The ability to pick which color light is going to turn on next, the ability I failed all of them failed everything have zero psychic power, fucking zero. But then there was a scene where I had to go into this dark room and try to generate energy and a, I was like, okay, like what? Like there's this or there's a guy named, I think his name was ed and Ed knew how to get it up to a million, which is higher than a CI masters.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       Like they had all this and all this crazy talk about your body being able to generate light. So mine is very hot. My reading is very high. But I take into consideration what I was doing afterwards and I'm like, I was wearing a battery pack. Like, how has that, that's not it. That's like the least scientific way of measuring light. I mean I have a fucking thing that has a light in it. Even if you can cover the light with a piece of tape, which they did. And even if you put the light under a shirt, if I'm fucking stretching around, what are the odds of some light peeking out there and sell equipment? What kind of sites?

Speaker 3:          01:12:23       Yeah, it could actually prove this stuff. They would be winning Nobel prizes cause it's like completely changed science. And then they claim that they have this proof and there's evidence that they can do detecting like ESPN stuff. But when the push comes to shove, they actually come.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       I, you know what, man, I've never seen anyone who can do it, but I can't believe that I know the extent of the capabilities of all human beings. There's people that have some really bizarre intuitive skills. There's people that uh, no danger better than other people

Speaker 3:          01:12:57       check doing this stuff. He's a

Speaker 5:          01:12:58       guy, by the way, he grew up in a very, very dangerous time. He grew up in South Africa. He was raising his kids, his brothers and sisters, I believe by himself. I don't know if I keep grew up like a street kid. Right. And that's, that's experienced human beings are really, really good at pattern recognition. So they did lots of studies with the Swat Team Guy, a veteran swat team guy and then they took a rookie cop and and the veterans, they have a guy just walking up to a school, a up to a school with a bomb pack to his body and behaving in a certain way and when they'd simulate it, the Swat team guys shoot him way earlier cause the Swat team guy was able to pick up immediately something was wrong with this guy. He wasn't a regular guy, was a twitch in his arm or whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:13:40       And he recognize patterns over years and that's what he was good at. So human beings get, Ken can develop what would be a peer to be psychic powers because they pick up out and recognition and pick up on signals way beforehand. Like guy who trains grizzly bears or lions. He was telling me, he said, I don't get bit because the lion of the grizzly bear, if he's in an irritable mood, is going to tell me three minutes beforehand when he's going to attack and people that don't know animals, the ones that get attacked, he said when a grizzly bears having a hard time with you, he'll start clicking his jaw. The minute he, his jaw training

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       sessions over baby that it's done. And lions are the same way. They start giving you signals way, way before, and they're subtle signals, but you, if you don't know how to read them, you're in big trouble. If you do know how to read them, step off so you're not a horse whisperer bitch. It seems like the reading the mind like mine reading of the bed, it's just the very well boasting in Beth psychology. Cesar Milan guy, that guy kicks dogs. We've ever seen him kicked dogs. Yeah, like this with the nines. Not that I'm thinking there's anything wrong with kicking some dogs, but he checks him hard dude. But I'm saying is he's very good at training dogs. And I'm not saying that what he does is wrong. What I'm saying is he ain't psychic. He's not whisper nice fucking dogs right now. He does.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       He tells people all the time, cause you got to keep to yourself. He said, yes, I'm here to train you. I'm not hearing the dog's fine. Dog tries to bite people and attacks don't reflection. It's actually you're the problem too. Like when you talk to talking about your friend who's like a sniper, I bet you had, there's sort of certain pattern recognition to people that are experiencing a massive dump of adrenaline. I go the the, the way they move, there's probably an erratic nature to the movement of a person who's, you know, literally at death's door. That's, that's gotta be an insanely intense experience. And I bet if you've seen that from a person and you're like, oh Jesus, you know, you see like a guy who was high on the adrenaline of about being about to do something. Yeah. I mean if you're looking at a guy was a suicide bomber or something along those lines, like could you imagine what that the sweat, they train the TSA to look for those signs. Oh yeah, and it's really better to look then those fucking cracks. He's cracked scientists and detective crack commandos. Those, those people. A Johnny on the spot at the TSA job. If you've seen this line attack video. Yes. Yeah. Have you put it on if you want. I think it's pretty fucked up, right? I've seen it.

Speaker 7:          01:16:02       Mall. Yeah. They fuck this guy up and look at the girl holds the ground. The girl is the only thing I saved this ditch. That guy got fucked up. Oh my God. Oh my God. They're squirting them with a hose and pointing him with sticks. Yeah, you have to. I know, but the fuck else did they have to man, that's their gig. Bitch. You're fired. Hindsight. The fight to the, you know what, man, I don't believe that line should be held in captivity. I agree with you on that. I certainly don't believe that they should be held in captivity and forced to do tricks. I think that's utter total bullshit. Stupidity, insanity. I think if you want to keep them in large preserves where they can roam free, that's one thing, but guess what? Feed them animals. If you're going to have them somewhere in any form of, Oh shit.

Speaker 7:          01:17:06       That is terrifying. Man. Really has. Yeah. Now they'd liked doing that. Now they found out fun. That can be, yeah, that's right. Your food. Oh my God. Lions going be pushed so far, man. Look at that too. Gfe fucked up. Oh my God. This is such an insane place to be poking a stick at fucking lions. Oh, he got jacked again. Oh my God. What a nightmare must be for those people. You got to get out. Boy. That shit girl. She's pulling her brown and the lines aren't fucking with her man. He must be the bad guy. Yeah. These guys must be dicks cannot have that case. That's total speculation and very rude of me to, I should say guys getting attacked by animals. I'm adding insult to injury. Why we wouldn't him up. I Dunno. I'm just being silly. I don't mean anything. I'm saying trying to be entertaining, but it's kind of like that movie zookeeper that you were in jail when that one guy was being mean to the gorilla. I remember. Yeah. That's sort of the Cliche, right?

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       Sort of like the evil stepmother. Right. You know that the, the zookeepers, we're always Dick's to the animals. There's always ones who keep a realism like animals. You as, sorry. Yeah. This span of check cat, um, he blew my mind and really changed the way I look at a lot of what I thought was like psychic stuff and I really, really set into my head. I still leave open the door for things that I don't have the abilities that I don't possess. I don't know. I don't know if we've completely explored the boundaries of, of human possibility. And I also don't know if what is possible today is going to be with the possible five years from now or 10 years from now. I think that if human beings got to this point through adaptation, through, you know, natural advantage, we got to all the things that we possess.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       You know, the ability to see, touch and feel and hear and smell. Why would I assume that there wouldn't be some sort of new thing that comes after that? I think if he does come, he's going to be meditation. Yes. It's not going to be from evolution. It's going to be good because actually modifying our bodies to gate implant. We'll give you telepathy. It could be, you know, there was an article that I tweeted, yes, there was an article I tweeted about Google that was like, you, you're going to be able to have an implant. There are ultimate goal of the Google glass is to be able to have an implant and when you have a thought in your mind stated that is their stated goal. That's right. That's right. Yeah. People are evolving themselves. It's like normally pollution has stopped for humans. Right, but let me, let me take it from a different angle. Isn't that also natural evolution and natural evolution by a human being augmenting his body with artificial technology is still a part of the actual evolution of the species is just figured out how to bypass the normal slow steps of the biological genetic evolution. It's an eight some shit with the imagination, the imagination that lives inside the biological entity news, its own limitation.

Speaker 6:          01:20:09       I think it's an inevitable consequence of like intelligent species are solving but it's, it's completely different but then again it's still is another path that was taken by nature the same way a be making a beehive got to happen. It's sort of like a natural

Speaker 5:          01:20:25       want to tweak. This gives an amazing talk about it on ted.com about how when they invent an artificial eye that can see a mile away, see during the night and it's biocompatible and an ear that does the same thing and a Nano Bot the size of red blood cells. You're going to use those things and we are going to mesh with machines way sooner than we will ever evolve.

Speaker 1:          01:20:44       It's coming. Yeah, and I bet the first thing is going to be dicks. It's going to be artificial. There's no doubt you're going to be s you know, and I haven't been able to figure that out yet to be able to figure it out. Erections, he'd been able to figure out Rogaine keeping some of your hair. There's a few things are still working on, but if soon as they could figure out a way to actually grow dicks, that's it because that's how you're going to do that with their doing with breasts. There's studies right now going, they're cloning how to manipulate tissue so that the woman will grow natural breasts with stem cells I think. Yeah, well I don't know the exact a process work guys, but they're going to try to figure out, yeah, I guess I got it.

Speaker 6:          01:21:20       Gross. Some tips to these guys, these training transgenders. Yes. Good boy. Good cat are going to be have some great titties, Sunni and maybe extra dicks. I think that also there

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       we're going to be a full, like complete x, y chromosome woman, like as much of a full complete woman as you can get. Like they'll be able to genetically engineer a vagina. They won't have to be some sort of a thing that you're making out of a penis. In the future. You're going to be, uh, like you might have still keep your chromosomes. It might still be an x, y chromosomes, but you will essentially be 100% female in every way.

Speaker 6:          01:21:52       So would you hit it like if, if she had the best pussy, the best real issue, it'd be a real issue. Well, you know, Progressive Society, right?

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       I'd like you to admit that that is a real woman, right? Asshole. And they would say that asshole, she is a real woman. If she became a real woman, would you hit it? She is a real woman asshole. Yeah. Those, there is a thing genetically a man. But you know, they're not the, the, the progressive opinion is that you're, you shouldn't even have to divulge that. You used to be a man. That's your medical history, warrior

Speaker 5:          01:22:21       princess. And I'm having him on my podcast, her on my podcast, Kristin Beck, who was Chris back who was a member of seal team six Dev grew, uh, and a and fascinating book because he was all she but, but when she was a, he, uh, always felt like a girl always and goes into why he thinks that's the case. Some of it had to do with the way he was raised, but also it was just the way he felt. AndG and literally as, as when he was even a very small kid, was always stealing his sister's clothes and wearing them and just always felt like woman joins the seal teams in seal team six to push what he calls his inner girl down. Come back after training. It would roar back in full like a TB back for two months. He'd be on a sailboat, dress like a woman every single day.

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       And this is a elite commando, a decorated war hero. And by the way, a war veteran by the, by the way. Yes. And also had done 13 deployments and I believe still works for the Department of Defense now that he's Kristin Beck. Can't wait to get her on my podcast to talk. That was another extended plug. It was not [inaudible] she taught you son of a bitch number one and two by the way. Yeah, I ended plugged us point Brian Talent show. It's on the iTunes. That's right. But, but the point is that it was when, when you, when you read this book and you realize how strong the urge to be a woman was and then she went ahead and got this whole operation, which is a major thing and by the way, and took so much flak for it. I, you know, in a way, I mean it just, it was something, she just have Jewish black jacket. What's that? Perhaps you'd get her a flak jacket. It was real protective from flack from, thank you. I'm going to open with that this weekend. And Bria, that was a plug. See, that's how you do a plug. That's good. I won't, I will. I will not be opening with that when I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. And I would never,

Speaker 1:          01:24:16       I would've never guessed to know what goes on inside someone's body. If someone tells me they were born a woman and they really are a man who the fuck.

Speaker 5:          01:24:24       Let me ask you to tell them. That's not the case. But here's my question to you is you have to say this MMA fighter, uh, who, who is now has gotten this, this sex change. But yeah, I've talked to Matt, I kept

Speaker 1:          01:24:36       so many times and I've also been in like enraging Twitter discussions with people. You know, I have to go through the, my, my feeling is I absolutely support anyone who wants to be a transgender, but I think there is a real issue with combat sports. I don't necessarily believe that there has been enough studies done that show that the male frame, it's not a significant advantage to have the male, the mechanics of the different shape tips, there's far less likelihood of ACL injuries for men just be because of the shape of the hips. And these are small issues. A big one is reaction time in measurable reaction time. Men have shown a 10% 10% faster reaction time almost across the board with the lead athletes. Wow. 10% faster than women. That's a big issue with striking a really big issue and even though they're swimming that can get to a skill level that will overcompensate that.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       I think that alone seems to me, unless you can replicate that somewhere, uh, healthfully for, for women, like it was, if there was something that women could take that would bring their natural reaction levels to where a man is that I don't think it can ever be safe. I think if a guy's an elite guy and a girls and elite girl and the guy has a one 10th of a second quicker reaction time, that's gigantic. So that alone, and this is not an a transphobic argument to me because I'm, it's completely open minded as you can be. I try very hard to look at things. Everybody's different point of view and I have zero issue with anyone wanting to change their gender. Zero. I think I'll call you a woman. You know, my issue only lies in combat sports cause I just don't think it's fair. And you know, there was an argument in a good one in fact, that I've considered as well that several people have said, well what about women who are naturally more aggressive or naturally have more testosterone? Like Serena Williams who's a natural one but a really big powerful athlete. It's a very good point because there's, there's women that are not going to be able to compete with her physically if they have the same skills, you know, the same level of technical proficiency.

Speaker 5:          01:26:40       Pete, with her, the same argument they were talking about where one, I think it was more as Korean. Maurice Greene has an inordinate number of amount of testosterone in this blood naturally occurring, whereas another sprinter does not. So then nature is unfair in that sense. Certainly. I'm so, so now where's that? So if he has 300 mil, whatever milligrams, I don't know how to measure it, but say 300 parts per million and the other guy has a hundred parts per million, what would it be acceptable for him then to take hormone test

Speaker 1:          01:27:09       question? Yeah, it's a good question and that's a question that's actually recently been proposed by MMA fighters that are saying, well listen, if these people are on testosterone replacement therapy, everybody should be allowed to be on it. As long as your levels are the same like your your, because these people are taking t the look. If they have an issue, they're taking testosterone. It's jacking them up to a very high level that very few people maintain at their age limit, but that's the acceptable limit. That's not very scientific to me because I feel like there's always going to be people that have a natural level that's very high, that gets beaten down during training and it's not going to care the same way and the person that's using indogenous chemicals, so that's, there's an issue with that. There's an issue that I think is not been fully completely resolved.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       That's why sanctioning is by a state, by state basis, a case by case basis. It's not like testosterone replacement therapy is not like uniformly accepted across the board. In fact, in some places like a fighter's, if I had to go and fight like a in Winnipeg, um, I'm pretty sure Rashad Evans who was on it had to get, or not Rashad Evans, excuse me, Dan Henderson who was on it had to get off of it because they wouldn't allow him to take testosterone replacement and and finding Canada now so that the UFC has a limit to what your testosterone, the UFC, it's the state with UFC is just to promote her. We are not the athletic bodies, so the Nevada state athletic commission, they look at things that way, but I think like scientifically we have to agree that it's a real issue as far as a performance enhancer.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       It's very significant. It's, it gives you a significant advantage. And then also you have to realize what's next when they do have these nanobots nanobots I like I said that it's like, when you say Afghanistan cost, there's no new boats when they do have these things and you're taking a mic and just so he could hold your breath at the bottom of a pool and make a youtube video for five hours, you know, that's what they're gonna be able to do according to Ray Kurzweil. Yeah. Yeah. Well, well, who would, who wouldn't take that? What are you crazy about the Olympics too and when you got to swim or who doesn't have to lift his head and he showers for it? We shattered at, but I think that in the idea of keeping sport pure, you can't hold back to evolution. And there's an evolution that we don't want to accept.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       It's a symbiotic evolution of humans and technology to create the new human. You know, it's, it's fucking happening whether you like it or not. Samsung has a new watch now that tells you how fast your heart rate is, all the shit that's going on. How many calories you burn hill each day syncs up to your smart phone. Yeah. How long before that things just embedded in your skin, you know, how long, how long before they, they'd take your ear, your shitty designed ear. Oh, you got an earache. How about we replace it with this carbon fiber thing that can hear on the moon? It's calming. It's calming. And if if you say no, you're stupid, you just as stupid as someone who doesn't get their bone bone fixed, when it breaks, it's going to come with its own challenges, that's for sure. Oh, absolutely. Just like everything else we've ever done in life has come with challenges.

Speaker 3:          01:30:03       I think the big thing is when we, uh, we, we get aging addressed by these doctors and people start living like a hundred to 200 years.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       Yes. That'd be a big problem. And that's not far away than 50 year old man has already been born. Uh, first hundred days a are likely person. Yeah. It's, to me it's absolutely and completely fascinating. This incredible time of change and this incredible time of possibility. The, the openings are just so much greater now than they've ever been before. As far as the possibility for change, a giant waves of change that will make the world almost impossible to comprehend to us right now as it's freakish, as the Internet is for us today. I think what's going to be next in the next four or 500 years is going to blow all this away. If we manage to stay alive, we managed to not blow ourselves up. I think they're going to resolve so many issues. Environmental issues, social issues, the the, the, the, the structure of society, the, the, the way we distribute money, all these things are there.

Speaker 1:          01:31:09       An echo of a shitty, ignorant time and we're stuck with a lot of really crummy fucking infrastructure and a really crummy system of doing things and a really crummy representation of the humans that are living on this planet. As far as the distribution of resources, the acclamation of accumulation of wealth, I think we're going to figure all that out in the future. It may be three, four generations from now, but when we figure out all our social shit, if we figure out that at the same time they figured out a way to actually use pollution for energy, keep the world clean with technology. That's something that people don't look at as a possibility that a technology

Speaker 3:          01:31:47       though, he's going to go ahead of the social change, so you're going to get this new technology, but you're going to have the same old social structures that you had before and that's going to create this huge complex. Where are you going to have this kind of a technological elite to be still going to have these masses of people who are just in the old ways?

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       It could be, but I don't think it has to be. I think there's a very distinct feeling that I get from Oh from communicating with people over the last few years that people, more people are paying more attention to the way the world is run than ever before. More people are getting more sensitive about inequality. Then I feel like I felt in a long time, Steven Pinker's book said that in the two thousands less people were killed violently than at any time in our history. So there and another guy wrote a book called the rational optimist to be read that in a very good book. Matt Ridley, I think his name and to um, same idea, just, just where we're headed there is there is progress that the way you're talking about more sort of, uh, I guess transparency and people not as ignorant people at least having more access to information.

Speaker 5:          01:32:47       Yeah. I don't think there's any evidence that points that people are going to continue to remain ignorant in the face of so much access to information that we have today. I mean, it's just the, this is a completely different world. The kids that are born in the last three or four years are growing up in a world that we couldn't even fucking imagine. My little kid knows how to go on to iTunes and order more points for the game that she likes. She's five. I was thinking of how to go to Itunes, add in this mommy, what's your password? Dik Dik dik dik dik she's fucking five. You know, when you try to follow the thread, if you were to, if you were to say in seven generations, it feels like we're being pushed to move beyond our basic biology. Yes. That's what it feels like.

Speaker 5:          01:33:27       And so, so if you were to able to download information into one's brain or even reversed, download the information in your brain into something as we were talking about, um, then the question becomes to what end is that? I've been trying to follow that thread. Why, what, what goes on? Say we are, cause you, if you could tap into a neural net, have virtual experiences, what it is to be someone else, uh, and, and we just get nudged closer and closer together in this sort of one sort of mind, if you will. Which I think is not far fetched. I mean it's kind of where we're headed now is editable. I can do standup now and you know, uh, California in New York, it's kind of the same audience. It used to be very, very different. We're, we're starting to, you know, you can go do stand up and you just go selfish with that.

Speaker 5:          01:34:12       I did talking about the unification. All tire stand up dude and you're talking to audiences to Raleigh, North Carolina. No son of a bitch. No, but are you, but I wonder then what do you think is the end result though? What do you think is where to, where are we going with that? The theory is like the singularity is that all of humanity and it'll technology with combined into this one thing, but I think it's going to be a remarkable set of circumstances that would have to happen for that to come about. I think it's inevitable. I think that remarkable set of circumstances is inevitable. We're not going to stop if it takes five years or 500 years, I don't know. I don't know how long it's going to tank, but if innovation continues to move forward in the same exponential exponential rate of progression that it's shown below the plummet. He said, well, I don't like that. It's just that that's

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       one. The other ones that are way bigger are the natural ones like the hundreds of thousands of near Earth objects that could be fucking zooming at us 45,000 miles an hour from behind the sun and those things are going to slam into us. Again, it's happened before. It was a lot of recent information that shows that uh, more than 10,000 years ago there was a a series of major impacts all throughout the world. They found volcanic glass all throughout Asia and Europe that indicates meteor showers. They got that Clovis comment that they've, they've now confirmed hit that somewhere around 12,500 years ago. These are like not that big a gap between us in that, yeah, that's not that long ago, 12,000 years ago there was like some extinction events like North America was wiped out. Like that's happened and it's just some shit that comes out of the sky

Speaker 4:          01:35:48       climate change. They're just, yes, that's going to be a slow death of civilization if slow death of Miami. That's for function. As a skeptic, are you, I'm a believer in global warming. You hear a lot of people saying, well, the science behind is really solid that there is, there has been warming over the last a hundred years and man is behind it. Uh, so the question is like, you know, what do you do about it?

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       Yeah, that gets obscured with the, um, the argument that it's a natural cycle because that's true. There is a natural cycle of heating, cooling and there have been times before people like the ice age when you know, North America had a mile high sheet of ice, a part of it, you know, there was a big chunk of this country, there was a glacier, but that maybe have changed without human interaction or human intervention or human causation. But that doesn't mean that this is like the idea that just because the earth's temperature fluctuates doesn't mean that we don't influence it. Like it's pretty obvious we influence it. You'd have to be crazy to fly above the city and look at how many fucking planes are criss crossing this guys and how much smog is down there and you fly over cities and see the pollution. To think that's having no impact is just silly.

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       Yeah. It's just silly. And when it was saying that about the science being solid it, so maybe think of what I said earlier about the chem trail. People that they, they, they have a similar kind of point of view about chem trails. They think the science is solid, but we think the science is solid on global climate change. And that perception of what I'm saying, it's going to be the exactly the same as my perception of as that of them

Speaker 1:          01:37:13       the science of what is, you know, what they're pointing to. Some of it is so nutty. And one of the ones that I argued with, this guy created the documentary was straight off of your site and we went to nick site and make, has this, um, thing on his site where it shows, um, the study that this gentleman was quoting and his documentary, it shows the results of the soil sample. Well, the sludge sample that he was saying was a water sample. And so, um, while I'm going over this information with him and he's assuring me of the veracity of these tests, and I know what this guy told me that this is water, but it says on the sample sludge. And so we test, we test this stuff and we read the results of the, and it says, you know, x amount of aluminum and x amount of barrels.

Speaker 1:          01:37:59       It basically has the same composition as what a lot of dirt has. Like you've, you scooped up some dirt, you're going to find a lot of aluminum in it. It's like a really natural occurring 7%. It's an amazing amount cause it's like savvy were eliminating. Wow. Yeah. It's one of the most common minerals. So I say to this guy like, do you understand that you're saying that your, your dirt tested positive for being dirt. That's what this says. Like that's crazy. But that is the best piece of evidence at Chem. Trails are real, you know, so everyone's saying like the high levels of aluminum, high levels of Barium, Lou aluminum is everywhere. Okay. It's fucking everywhere. And if you knew that we wouldn't be having this discussion. If you knew that aluminum was in dirt all over the fucking world, you wouldn't be worried about people spraying it from the sky.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       Why would they do that? It's everywhere. It's everywhere. And if it was in the sky, and this is what really got me annoyed, talked to many people that believe that those clouds are aluminum and you know something else like floating in the air. But if you talk to anybody who's actually seen aluminum, it wouldn't look anything like a fucking cloud. It wouldn't look like a cloud and it wouldn't stay in the air, wouldn't just float there. It's got weight to it. It's not mist like, well, you're looking at is actual clouds. It's not like, like when they sky, right, that's smoke. But even that doesn't last dissipates when they fly over in a, in a, you know, and you see like a, a big fat heavy contrail that that's a fucking cloud man. That's not aluminum. That's a cloud.

Speaker 4:          01:39:29       Yeah. And it's not even really coming out of the back of the plane. The plane is just triggering it. It's making a cloud for and by just

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       just the spray, not a little condensed. Haven't documented on my website info. [inaudible] dot com we've got high high resolution photographs. Brian Callan, they're spraying your children with Boron and lithium.

Speaker 4:          01:39:48       What's your stance on tower seven? Uh, where do you want to know? Because that's one of the things that drives me the most crazy. I just how much it's like, please stop, you know, uh, do you, do you think, wait a minute, it drives you the most crazy that people talk about it as a conspiracy? Yeah. Why is it driving me crazy? Because it's just like people thinking that it was exploded to eighth. Do you believe? I think it just caught fire and the collapse. Yeah. Now I, the heat that it says it made, there's some people saying that it was, you know, there's a huge amount of, uh, different things that people might bring up. A nine 11. And it's one of the big problems with, with deep on King is that there's just an endless stream of things that people will bring it up. They'll say, hey, what about the hotspots? What about the free for, what about the little bits of fire? What about, what about the squibble explosions on the side of the building and you can go through each one of them and you can address each one individually and explain what's actually going on.

Speaker 1:          01:40:39       Let me tell you how I approached it. I looked at it, the first thing I said, oh my God, they detonated that thing for sure. I said, the way I looked to me like the thing exploded, um, or rather a collapsed into its foundation. I'd never seen a building do that before. It a hole on the side of it

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       where it had been hit by the, uh, the towers that were falling. And even though there's this big chunk missing from one side, it fell uniformly kinked in the mental and felt like the controlled demolition. And so I was looking at it, I was like, you know what, that looks like a fucking controlled demolition. And then I realized that I'm stupid and I'm not an engineer at all and I don't know the tolerances of fire and metal and the metal, the concrete. And I'm looking at this and yeah, it did fall free, fall speed. But maybe that's what fucking happens when you get this car. And people were like, well there's never been a building that sort of burned to the ground and felt like that in clubs. That's true. But there's also never been a bridge like that giant bridge in Minnesota that just collapsed and those people were driving over it. Remember that it was a big fucking tragedy, man. It bridges collapsed. Sometimes people, they design shit and then when they put it together it's sucks, you know? And sometimes you have these giant fires that exposes the fact that your design sucks. Well genuine.

Speaker 4:          01:41:52       They have to change building codes afterwards because of the, the, the reason the building seven collapse they think is that what they had these very long spans of the floor and went in wasn't secured as well as the other end. So it pushed one end off and that fell and that kind of

Speaker 2:          01:42:05       go pull it up, pull it up Brian, just let's look, look at it in real time. Cause it's, it is incredible how fast it falls. It literally falls free fall speed. It's like the whole thing, kids out uniformly and it just collapses into its base.

Speaker 4:          01:42:18       He is very misleading because a lot of the times people show you this video of the building collapsing in the show from afterward the penthouse falls where the penthouse is falling in world trade centuries. It's showing the interior of the building is collapsing. Hmm. And when you actually see the building itself collapsing, there's pretty much nothing left of the outside of the outside the inside. It's either it's either collapse or it's in the process of collapsing and you've got this very strong skin outside. That's the other thing about building seven the interior set up on this big screen in a second. The idea of jet fuel burning so hot that it melts metal nonsense though cause it doesn't burn hot enough to melt it. It Burns hot enough to weaken it. Let's watch it here. Let's watch this sucker go down. Ready? That's like several seconds into the collapse.

Speaker 2:          01:43:02       I'm going to tell you something. If I was Larry Silverstein, I would sue the fuck out of whoever built me that shitty building. God Damn. Because if that isn't some grand conspiracy, the CIA, the DEA, they have their documents in that building along with major banks. Isn't that a part of the conspiracy side? But is that true? That is true, right? Yeah. They had some documents in there and they lost the sun. Just stuff them sons of bitches are in awesome. I shop on a computer. No, no, no, no backup. They don't do backup. They write things down on paper. It was all in that building. Alluded that shit up. They blew that shit up to protect the evidence. Um, and I'm not saying that Alex is wrong again cause I am stupid, but uh, I would be fucking pissed off if I made that building and it fell apart like that. God Damn, I be expected that to happen.

Speaker 4:          01:43:49       The building was, wants to coat that was like, they just didn't

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       know that that type of thing was going to happen. The idea that they could have giant diesel fucking tanks in the basement is running everything. They had giant diesel tanks. Yeah. Like that's part of what started this massive and inferno destroyed. It didn't, that's more horse shit now he had the diesel tanks, they actually recovered a whole bunch of that data lines. So they had diesel tanks. The whole building's on fire and a diesel tanks didn't catch on fire. The whole building wasn't on fire. It was like several floors in several sections I've ever. But like the sections with the diesel, what? They were isolated and they didn't burn. They didn't contribute. Hold on a second. So you're saying that whole thing wasn't on fire. If it wasn't on fire, how the fuck did this happen then? Lots of it was only two. How many floors? Major floors. I believe right now I know there was like two, two floors. That dad the big collapse a, I can't remember who they were, but uh huh. And he was 17 and 18. How many floors were on fire here? Uh, well most of the floors are on player. On the south side. If you look at the south side of the building, the entire thing is engulfed in smoke. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:44:48       Besides always cooler. Why is that? Everywhere you go. Everywhere you go. Back on the south side of Chicago, I just read Lawrence Wright's Pulitzer Prize winning book called the um, there looming tower and he takes five exhaustive years to, to study the origins of nine 11 and this Mo, this sort of Islamic fundamentalist movement in half and started in Saudi Arabia and moved to the sedan and move to Afghanistan. I mean if you really, I always say read the book. That's totally different side is on fire. That book was designed by the government. It is a DC information campaign. It's been proven on info wars.com yeah, look at that. That's like, I just have to take the Alex Jones point of view of, I'm sure he has documents. He's my Frankie. Oh did he thought smoke? There's one entire, call them in the middle of the faith. Feel comfortable with that being enough to bring that fucking building down. I'm be honest with you, but what he's saying is that it pretty much did a collapse, like one of the floors fucked like fell down. I understand the whole concept, but I don't blast buyer though. I don't buy it. I think the DEA, the NSA, they place thermite. That's a lot of people in the building. I'm Laura. I'm just being honest. I really, I look at that and I, the way it collapsed, it's

Speaker 6:          01:46:03       just like God, it, I think it would need to be really, really, really, really fucked up. But the thing is that the explanation of why collapse, it's just a bit too complicated, but why is it too complicated to all those architects and engineers for nine 11 truth or those guys, all crazy heads that just kind of the, uh, the fringe bottom of the barrel of the architects and engineers, oh, how dare you, how dare you discredit them? Ad Hominem attacks on these fine gentlemen. She owed us. A whole bunch of them are very good at what they do, but they're not generally experts in structural engineering of large buildings and their reactions to fire because when that building was built, the people who were engineers at that time thought that it was perfectly safe and they thought if there was a fire, it wasn't going to collapse because they didn't factor in this one thing. You know, I look at it and it looks like a controlled demolition to me, but again, I'm saying it is. What I'm

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       saying is, remember the story I told you about Ted Nugent shooting the deer and the side and the Arrow comes out of the top of it. Weird Shit fucking happened sometimes and you get some asshole bid. You a shitty ass building. This building, man, this building sucks. A fat one dude and it's got a little bitty firing it. It just collapses. Or really a little bitty fired off to bring it down. A giant building. Yeah, or the CIA or had documents. What about the thermite? Can you disprove the thermodynamic West? Oh, you can't disprove, hey, stop trying to skirt around my questions with your new world order. Flim flam do you disprove thermite while those, you know, it really built bummed me out. There was a photo that someone had sent me, uh, like look at this dude. This is proof that there had to be some sort of thermite involve in the cutting of the steel at the base of the building fact and this guy turned out to be, he's a, he's an author of questionable literature.

Speaker 2:          01:47:50       It's just, no, I think it's all of this stuff is fucking cuckoo head shit. Cause I looked at it and I found out that no, that's not what it is. They actually put that stuff on. They actually cut those things at the end when they were doing cleanup. That's from a torch. They sliced it down with a torch. What was, well I'm sorry, what people were sending these, these emails when these mass emails showing these cuts that had been made during cleanup, when you know, the, the, the, the towers fell down devastating, destructive, huge impact. They had to clean up all the debris and they had a cut a lot of it up and the photos of the, the stuff cut up. People were sending it around. It's proof of thermite. They use thermite look at it sliced at an angle could not have been possibly created by the explosion of the building.

Speaker 2:          01:48:37       That's a fire right there. That's a big ass fire. Yeah. But how many floors is that though? Is that enough to bring down my building? I'll fucking sue you bitch. That was my building based on the north side of the talent. So you can see these lists. Embraceable fires cause all the fires started when light the World Trade Center to you like oh one I understand and I understand it for the record, I just want to let everybody know and when I say that it looks like a controlled demolition. I'm definitely not saying that it is or not saying it does look like it does look like. And I'm not saying that I have any right to debate the structural merits of this building. I've, I have no nothing. I'm completely retarded when it comes to that and my dad's an architect. Oh is he?

Speaker 2:          01:49:13       Yeah. I mean I guess I could call him up and ask him some questions about point about the fact that you have a lot of so called experts on that truth commission thing or did that people the truth, there's a bottom of the barrel arbitrary or or their expertise isn't, isn't huge structures and how they would, how they respond to fire and and impact. I mean, yeah, that's a specific shitty contractors who fuck you over and make you a building that when you let a couple of floors on fire just fucking falls apart. Couple of, a couple of, I did see huge planes. I was into those buildings. No other one. That's

Speaker 1:          01:49:47       tower seven. I know. Silly Bitch. Yeah. That's the big argument. Tower stuff is only building, never felt like it's the work right here. There I used to work right if a couple of blocks away. It's really sad. There's a lot of people that live in that area too that stayed after the impact and they were inhaling chemicals, toxic chemicals on a daily basis. Like Donna Summers, man. Donna Summers died of lung cancer. Yes. And she lived in that area. Wow. Yeah, she lived right near the, um, the, the towers and she died of lung cancer. She didn't even smoke. Yeah. It happened. It happened to a lot of people. It's not a small thing. I mean that the impact of that thing is firemen, cops to turn them to workers, all first, first responders. A lot of those guys got really, really, really sick. Yeah. That's something that doesn't get taken into consideration when you talk about the death toll of those things. But that is a really worthy thing to think about as opposed to the idea that the government engineered it and there was this conspiracy, these guys didn't even know how to fly. And some of the high that hit the hitchhikers hijackers are still alive. They're in Saudi Arabia. Like, man, I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          01:50:56       I Dunno. What has happened has been, I mean, like I said, there's been so much good journalism. I mean, Oh, good investigative and exhaustive journalism that, that,

Speaker 1:          01:51:07       that will tell you the story. So many different stories though. That's part of the problem is complicated, but people don't have the time cause these complicated stories. Here's what I, here's one point that I bring up. Whenever people talk about conspiracy theories, I say, do you believe in nine 11? And when they say they do, and I say, well then you believe in conspiracy theories because people conspired. They pulled that off and they did it and it was a real conspiracy and that shit is real and it does happen. Absolutely. Just like a lot of other conspiracies that happened throughout time that were absolutely proven to be real events. There's a lot of them. There's not just one or two.

Speaker 5:          01:51:43       They, they, they, you know, from all the evidence that I've read and that seems credible, that a group of dedicated fanatics under the banner of fundamentalist Islam got together, got financed and pulled off this pretty amazing feat, which was very different.

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       See, I wouldn't say that I believe that entirely. Um, without, without any pause because I don't know anything about flying a plane. Okay. I don't know anything about being able to do the maneuvers that those people have done, but I've seen these specials where they break down whether or not a plane would actually be able to hit the Pentagon like it did and take the path that it did and then the people can't reproduce that in the simulator and that they have been able to control planes by the use of a drone technology. They've been able to do that since the 1960s in fact, that was part of the northwest document. Part of the northwest document was exploding a fake a plane and pretending it was filled with people. But we're going to take a drone and fly

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       it up and blow it up. So this was a commercial airline? Yeah, but it doesn't matter. It's still a plane and we know that you can control the plane. We could control it. Jet With drone technology as far back as the 1960s so whether or not that was a part of what got me, maybe these guys took over the, they had to take over the cockpit to allow that to take place. Like, we don't know they're dead, but the, the maneuvers that those jets did, it could have easily been something like someone had hijacked and hacked into the system and figured out how to turn that diegetic to a drone. Not Difficult. I talked a lot of pilots. I'm the one that went into the Pentagon. Yeah. Really. We'll talk about it being this light, you know, death spiral that they had to do. But if you look at it on the map, it's really just a very slow descending three 60 loop.

Speaker 2:          01:53:30       But it at an incredible speed, right by a guy who wasn't experienced pilot and had no experience flying those kinds of jets. The speed that the planes fly out, he didn't actually make any difference to the maneuvering cause it's, it's all, it's all relative razor outcomes, razor two things. One, you're certainly right. Um, the more likely scenario is that they pulled off these incredible and Hoover's. He's incredible banks into the more likely, well for these people that didn't know how to fly. For a guy like me, it's what I did that they went to school for it, they went to school. And we all, we have, we have, we have FBI, uh, one of the biggest things you have to be, I never shared that information with the CIA for a whole bunch of reasons, mainly because they in some ways weren't even allowed to, uh, because there's always been a firewall between FBI, between spying on domestic and, and, and an end and an international and there's actually laws involved.

Speaker 2:          01:54:11       But one of the things that we know for sure is that these people in the CIA knew that. I mean the FBI knew this and we have documents about this. We knew these people were studying. We were at, we're at flight simulation schools, we know that. So they have the commercial licenses. The guy flew into the Pentagon has a committal listen, very hard to get right. And my point thing, you just get from like, you know, flying Microsoft flight simulator for a few hours or something that you have to do hours and hours and hours of practice. I totally, I totally understand. And uh, like I said, most likely that's what happened. But then I also leave open the possibility that they had an insurance policy and they didn't allow these guys to decide whether or not they wanted to fly right into a fucking building and smash into it. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:54:51       That's not what comes razor. Oh No, you're, no it's not. I said that was the first part. The first I agree with you. That's what I'm saying. I don't have a, I don't have a dog in this race. What I'm saying is that I do know that there was some sort of technology that allowed them to use drone technology to control jets as recent as far back as 1960s not saying that that's what happened, but saying that what you saw could be replicated with drones. I think the technology is there. Any amateur pilot could probably have pulled off what they were doing. It really wasn't that hard. It's not that hard. Certainly to fly into the buildings wasn't that hard and my father and my father was a pilot for 20 years and he said, that's very easy. It's steering a plane is pretty much easier though. It's during a call. You just really easy to, well, why don't they release the videos for the Pentagon being hit by the players? A question. Why is that? By the way, why don't we have video of those planes flying into the Pentagon?

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       We do have that one from the uh, the parking garage where you can stay for a few, a few frames. There's a, yeah, it comes in, it looks more like a missile to me. Ms. West, I would just, uh, I don't see any reason why they would be like, you know, that many video cameras pointing at that parking lot of this.

Speaker 1:          01:55:58       Well that's not the case though. There are, there are videos. There's certainly our videos or video cameras and video cameras were there. Their videos were taken. Right. It was like they had shown that there had been more than one video of this. This was the only one that they apparently pointing within inside sort of where we're at,

Speaker 4:          01:56:16       cameras, cameras pointing out looking for plaintiff

Speaker 1:          01:56:19       is coming in. I thought there was more than one. I thought that, I'm pretty sure as it got to say this, yeah. I have something like something like that, like a gas station or something nearby where they had a video of it and they gave it to the FBI and the FBI just took it. But you know the other thing is like why, why put it out there? I mean if you, if you were the FBI, let's say, or the see it, where the fuck is in charge with this, right? You're going door to door and finding out who's good security cam videos. Would you want those videos to go on the Internet? We've already got these giant towers, it fells or video or this video. Would you just sweep the thing up that shows the hit of the Pentagon? Cause you know how many times they're going to show that they're gonna hit show the main point or building getting hit by a jet.

Speaker 1:          01:56:57       Oh La, la La. All their videos is going to start with that. The jet hitting the Pentagon. We've coming back for you. Boom. You know, that's an iconic building. And like if you did have a video of it blowing up, I guess they didn't have it. I supposedly, it didn't record anything. Yeah, that's what I would say too. It's kind of, I mean my day or released it. I was always surprised that they never really brought up bin Laden's body back. I know they didn't want to have a shrine for people to come to, so they don't buy that. I don't buy that one. I don't buy the been loved one. I think that dude had been dead for a long time. I think they probably, Jackson guy will look like him and said, let's just take that frozen

Speaker 2:          01:57:34       bid lawn sickle out and toss it in the other. She had been on sick say, we got this bitch. Obama was like, listen, I'm going to, I'm going to work with you. You're going to work with me. You're going to get me in the office. I'm going to look like a hero. This is what I need. I need that bin. Ladin sickle, they had that break glass in case of publicity. They had that with a bin. Ladin sickle. Just sit in there.

Speaker 1:          01:57:54       Wait for a moment. I met a guy who was on the raid. I met a seal team six.

Speaker 2:          01:57:58       Yeah, I bet he'd say, I told you this while he's fucking you in the ass. And then I'm gonna tell you something. I kicked that door open. I'm going to come grab my boss, man. I killed him. I feel in the story. Turns out your boy wasn't even a seal ticks mailer. It's just so crazy. Gay Guy Looks so fuck actors just like still hold after is down to my store. I took it up the ass for my country. I did it for Pat Tillman. He needs to know the truth.

Speaker 1:          01:58:26       Ah. So that's the big one that people will bring up. Back to the conspiracy theory is the tower setup.

Speaker 4:          01:58:33       Yeah. I like, I like to bring that up because people like, did you know the three buildings fell on nine 11 and they make out like this big thing that's been covered up. It's covered up. It's totally wrong. It's not even on the Internet. Oh wait, I think it's best if you actually talking with the nine 11 truth or I want to go straight to building seven and talk about that. Oh, go right from the get go. Yeah. Cause that's the thing that they think is the real biggest bit of evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:58:54       Well it certainly looks like a controlled demolition. Like you'd met. I can't ever see headlines of conspiracy theory. Midwest admits nine 11 it looks like a controlled demolition. That is it. I mean they could use that

Speaker 4:          01:59:04       quote. That is what, that is a quote. It does look like controlling the militia Dutch, a demolition expert and they're saying, oh yeah, that looks like a controlled demolition. Then he goes into like how they might've done it, but the thing they don't show is that like 10 minutes earlier he's looking at the towers falling and said, oh there's no way that could have been a controlled demolition. Oh really? Yeah. Really good guy. Same interview. Oh, and they didn't do shit.

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       That's very Michael Morton. Yeah. You can't do that right now. You've got to show both sides and you're just selling entertainment. You know, I don't mind that. But you gotta let me know. You know, like have a, like a disclaimer. I say, listen, there's some arguments against this, but fuck them. It's not, they're moving. Right. That's then don't call it a documentary then it's a movie, not a documentary. I would do that and then would have, I would play the whole movie and then I would use the trailer and the truck at the end, the trailers, all me getting owned. I get tricked you. I did. I gave a movie where I pretend that I had a point when I uncovered some secrets, but it really, I left out all the arguments against my stupid theories and at the end of it, I just got owned and I didn't play that until the very end. I'd watch it. Um, do people get mad at you? Yeah. People think that you're a government agent. Yeah. I've, I've had, uh, more than one person tell me to look out Midwest of government agent. Are you a government agent? Maybe I look like I could see that. She can't say that because now that's first of all, why didn't he just say no? Ask me. Brian Count asked me Joe Rogan and you a government agent.

Speaker 4:          02:00:31       No de mic. Yes, I am. No, I'm not. But I think you're so fucking contradictory. I believe you less and less every morning. I think he's actually like a useful or useful exercise for people to assume that I am a government agent. Well that makes what? What have I said that's wrong. That's cool. We are both actually in the Illuminati by the way. You're in the and iTunes and she didn't tell me, why won't you tell me, what did they give you? Oh cool. Vodka.

Speaker 2:          02:01:00       Is there a conspiracy theory or is there something for both of you? Cause I know you've been doing this show now, is there something that kind of that you had trouble explaining where you just kind of went, well that is pretty amazing. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       nothing that springs to mind but that there are like, you know, real conspiracies out of that.

Speaker 2:          02:01:18       That's his point is what I like about Mick is that he is skeptical, but he also is realistic about what has and hasn't taken place. It's not like you're trying to debunk everything that could, that's a conspiracy and that becomes a problem because of that word. That word conspiracy is a weird word. Like, even though there are people can inspire to

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       do things, you know, even though you know, did Oswaldo kill JFK? I don't know. I don't know if Oswald killed JFK, but I know that there was someone who conspired to kill JFK and got away with it. I know there was a lot of, a lot of things that happened. There's a lot of people involved. You know, whether it was the whoever, the Cubans or whoever hired Oswald or whether it was other people that were in the grassy knoll, which is still a distinct possibility, still a distinct possibility. There's just not enough evidence. And the, the fuckery involved in the JFK assassination, is it an all time high? Just the fact that they concluded that a third bullet or that this bullet had, they had, they had found a chipped kerbstone underneath the overpass and because of that they had to attribute all these different wounds to one bullet.

Speaker 1:          02:02:29       That's where the magic bullet theory came from. A much more realistic possibilities that he was hit by more than one bullet. Sure. Much more real estate. Not only that, much more realistic to think that they really did hire this mob guy to fucking sneak pass all these cops and shoot Oswald before he could talk, which they did. They sound like this mob guy was this guy who is like, you know, I'm fucking pro America and this fucking cock suckers dot going to kill my president, and he ran up on them and with the cops there, no one is life is on the line, please. I think that guy got talked into it. They, oh, he owed money. He owed something. When you look at the Jack Ruby story, that's a guy who was a crook whose whole life involved in organized crime his whole life. Complete degenerate scum bag club owner deep in bed with the mom probably had a gambling problem, please.

Speaker 1:          02:03:21       There's a constant, there's a conspiracy there. There's no doubt about it. The magic bullet thing though, I think that's one of the things that has become accepted in the conspiracy culture as being just, it's an article of faith that it was impossible for the magic bullet to, it happened. It's also an article of faith that it was possible when you consider the fact that it showed up on the Gurney on Connolly's Gurney in the hospital. Oh look, they found the bullet in almost pristine condition. Well, we're totally trustworthy type people, so by it please. But the magic bullet has been replicated a couple of times with, I haven't seen that really? Where's that? Yeah. I think it was a discovery channel thing or, oh, no, no, no, no, no. They didn't replicate it. I know what you're talking about. They only replicated it when it didn't hit bone.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       They did replicated, but when it hit bone, every time they hit bone, it became contorted in the store. They did it through Gel. They did it through a bunch of different things that mimic human tissue. It's very difficult to exactly what happened, but they got something that was close enough that it seemed close. Ooh, I disagree. I disagree on that one because I've seen that special. I know exactly. I know. The Guy who think and know the guy who was involved in that. Was it? There wasn't a Jesse Ventura when he was it, was it a mythbusters one? Yes. Todd, the guy who produced my show, uh, also, uh, did some work on mythbusters. I have to ask him what, what the exact specifics works. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. No, I mean, now I'm thinking it's not even a mythbusters one, but do they had a jelly thing with like bone in it and when it hit the bone and would get fucked up more fucked up than that bullet.

Speaker 1:          02:04:45       I mean, the bull was in pretty amazing shape. It's even if it did, let's say that obviously I wasn't there. I don't know whether or not the magic bullet really took the trajectory that it's being attributed to, but let's say if it did, it's amazing. It's amazing that the bullet came out like that. It doesn't mean that it's not possible, but it's amazing. It's amazing that it went through two people caused all that damage, left fragments inside their bodies that they had to remove. Pretty incredible. When you look at what it looks like, so is it impossible? Of course. I would never say that. I don't know. I didn't look the biggest thing as Jack Ruby actually running a shooting. I, there's no reason that that was, that was very interesting to me. It's fascinating. Fascinating Oswald. So obviously he, they wanted Oswald quiet jack when we didn't do that because he felt bad for Jackie.

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       There's more than enough evidence to indicate that there was more than one person involved. It wasn't just just him, just by the paper trail. I mean, the fact that the guy, the guy, he'd been to Cuba, Soviet Union, I mean he had a Russian wife and brought her back with them. I mean, this guy was like, uh, he was involved in some really weird shit. And just that alone, like if, if Oswald was the shooter and it was just Oswald man, there had to be a lot of other people involved in this. This is not something that he decided to do on his own. One day I seen that. I couldn't believe how steep that trajectory was, but he shot right down on it, which I thought he was shot. He didn't do it. What do you think fucking shot that guy for the grassy knoll overall? Do you think he did it?

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       I would probably like, yeah. Or on the side of him doing it. Uh, I think there's lots of unanswered questions. And again, this is like hundreds and hundreds of books being written and I'll promote perspectives on it. I don't think it's a question we're ever really going to answer. And it's a really hard one to debunk because you can't do it satisfactorily. Even things like the magic bullet, it's really, really hard to actually prove that that would have happened. You can prove that something like that might have happened, but you know, it's maybe kind of unlikely and it was just a lucky shot and this thing's like a, the back to the left thing, whether he hit his head, goes back to the left. Uh, and it's, you know, I, I've had long debates about that on, on the forum and, uh, uh, it's just a very hard thing to convince people that that might have been like, you know, the bullet hitting from behind and he's head goes back. Uh, because like, you know, bullets don't actually impart that much velocity into people's heads when they get shot in the head. But people, you know, they have this, these articles of faith that because he's had went back into the left, then he must've been shot from the front. So that must have been another gun man.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       Well, you know what, um, I actually kind of disagree that it goes back into the left. Initially. I think the initial spray actually comes forward, which is virtually impossible if you're getting shot from the front. And uh, I think there is something that other people need to consider. I think he was shot from all over the place. I think the whole and the trake that they made a tray, Cole and his neck, I think that has an impact wound. I think it's been pretty, it's been pretty well argued based. The difference between the autopsy report in I'm in Dallas and then the autopsy report and Bethesda, Maryland that they were looking at two totally different things. They were describing wounds in a different way and there's been, it's been widely reported that they had generals standing over the hospital bed directing doctors on how to report this stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:07:53       If that's true and if there really were military people that are allowed inside the operating room and the president's body was brought in and they really did define where the wounds came from, who knows what the motive would have been in 1963 and a mad scramble when the president's been myrtle. Who knows how much shitty thinking is involved. How much of is a personality conflict between a general and a doctor doesn't want him in the room. Who knows what the fuck is going on? Who knows, but if I was going to shoot the president, I wouldn't kind of one guy to pull it off. Why would you do that? If you can get one Lee Harvey Oswald Asshole, you can get five more dudes sitting to grassy knoll and fucking peck this guy off as he's driving towards you, you're not going to just shoot, you're not gonna.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       If there's a grand conspiracy to kill the president, which most likely there was. I just don't see Oswald being like, I'm going to do this on my own. I don't need any help. No assassin's. I've always in. A lot of times it's been people who were on the fringe of some kind of movement or Gee, I think, sure. You know, and, but they were generally and essentially loners. I think for the most part, you know, guys who had always had trouble fitting in, you know, and we're trying to look to be significant and we're loosely attached to several different organizations are at one organization, whether it was at and usually a general way. How many of them have there been that you can make such a rash generalization? I'm thinking about boots. Something about the Guy John Tried to kill the guy who shot, who shot the archduke Ferdinand and his wife at the beginning of world war.

Speaker 1:          02:09:18       That sort of sparked world war one. I'm thinking about the guy who assassinated, uh, Lincoln. The, these guys were, were one was a Serbian terror. Uh, how do we know that all those weren't conspiracies to, and then someone was behind the scenes manipulating, well, they're not manipulating Bryan county back then. You're part of a group that has a stated mission and goal, which is what a, I can't remember the guy's name who killed, but look at Sirhan Sirhan who shot, uh, you know, Bobby Kennedy, that guy tried to assassinate the pope. These people are generally, you know, loners. We did fear factor in that kitchen is, yeah. Yeah. It's creepy. Walked right through that bitch. So like how is this not like a part of the history that's in la? It's not even there anymore. I'm pretty sure they tore it down. It was like a landmark. It was a hotel and they were using it for, um, for filming there. Would people do like the horror movies there and shit got shot there. Actually you shot film there. I mean Christ, Brian [inaudible] guys know that yes, Jesus Christ aren't just talking about assassins and basically named yourself talking about what is our owner. You are so embarrassed how you go against the grain. You make impulsive decisions and shooting the president. Ariane, I'm a contrarian. I think at JFK that was one of those conspiracy theories that you can never

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       really deep on. I love that you're willing to admit that it's, it's like you know everything's so far in the past the evidence has been gone over with a fine tooth comb and there's still all these like case closed. I hate those guys on both sides. You get people who will say it's definitive one way or the other but then there's just so much unknown about it that you never going to be able to close it. But there are, there are conservation theories that you can prove that aren't going on. Like the chem trail thing. And there are aspects of the, the broader theories like, like JFK and nine 11 that you can address. You can address individual points of evidence, but I don't think you're ever really going to be able to debunk nine 11. It's just, it's going to go on forever. Basically, people look at, there's always going to be some people who are going to think that there was an inside job.

Speaker 2:          02:11:16       Hitler burned the rash tag. Nero burned Rome. Of course, you know, all these things. You're a student of history being an disinformation agent from another country. It probably taught you about America and our history of this great land for you. Came over here. You sound like man cow. No, he's more Chicago. I did his, did his, uh, cause he still right. Well he's sort of like, he's paying, putting on an act. He puts on an activity. Like we had an argument, fake argument about Carlos Man. See Ya. He was wearing his sunglasses at seven in the morning. I was like, this isn't gonna go well. How he was running back, I dunno, I wear sunglasses in studio are problematic. Oh my God. He was acting like a rock star. Like he was doing something like writing, like flying a spaceship. I was like, Bro, relax. You're just, you're doing a radio show.

Speaker 2:          02:12:04       I'm feeling good about this. Look. Oh, there it is. Ladies and gentlemen, put it on the back of the famous man. This is how you know, this is how you know you're slipping when you take pictures like this. Sorry, Anthony Bourdain. I love you. That's when you know you're slipping Anthony Bourdain's picture the CNN pictures like this. I love that guy. I know he gets away with it. Oh he does? He gets a free pass on everything he does. He's my boyfriend. He's awesome. I love that guy. Yeah, you do. You're actually, you've got a man crush on board. Dang. He's a great guy. He's one of the few people that I was giddy about getting to eat dinner with. I've had dinner with them and drinks and got laid up, got lit up in Montreal together. Oh, he's beautiful person, man. We talked to like fucking three o'clock in the morning till they kicked us out of the bar.

Speaker 2:          02:12:43       No so much. He's just a great guy. He's a great, interesting guy that sees the world and didn't become famous till he was older in life. So He's very appreciative of it and very balanced and he's all about like putting in the work is all about like just living the life and just putting a guy we shot. We did meet either with, it was one of his camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was talking about it. Boy, if you want to have a fucking cushy Gig as a cameraman, man, what a cool gig. Rather Bordain and then meat eater. Two totally different things. One of them you're standing for stars, hotels, the other one, you're in a fucking bag of cloth. It's 16,000 degrees below zero and you're trying to kill a buffalo with a spear. This show meat eaters. One of my, I, I'd have to say it's my favorite show. So show I look forward to the most, especially after a Brian and I, we went hunting on it with this guy.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       He goes hunting because it's like, does fair chase hunts goes out in the middle of like, you know, it goes to Alaska. This week was Alaska was hunting bears that were searching for blueberries in the high altitude. Did you, did you get, um, did you get your gear yet? Yes, I haven't. I haven't. I've been slacking. Shit, bitch. Ryan Kennedy, Carolyn again. Ryan, Kelly, man. I got to come Kai and I got to call you. She sent me probably email them. Don't use the podcast. You Fuck? I was, what other, um, what other, um, conspiracies are like big ones that you get asked to, to debunk all the time. Uh, well, you know, people bring up things like Ufo. What about Elvis? Yeah. Uh, oh, this is bullshit. You alive and just decided enough was enough. Man. Didn't want the life. That's the Michael Hastings thing. Ah, the Michael Hastings thing. And this is where you're going to show what a, what a government shill. You really are. You going to tell me the Michael Hastings car wasn't rigged to explode and flying to that tree at a hundred miles an hour. It looks exactly like he was just driving like a crazy guy and he hit the tree. I hit a bump in the,

Speaker 2:          02:14:35       maybe the government use their mind control h everyone's looking for a drone. It's not a drone. They don't turn your car into a drone that technology's not available yet, but they can Manchurian candidate you, they can get inside your mind and convince you that for the greater good of mankind and the cause that you're involved in driving to a fucking tree. They released show. I found the photos when actually it would be we're filled. I was went to the set with you on fear factor. The day that we went to that hotel and I found the photos that I took. Oh

Speaker 1:          02:15:04       Wow. Where's torn down? Old School old school stuff. So he was a shot in that kitchen. Yeah. Wow. That's creepy shit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:15:12       And the 17 different gunshots rang out in three seconds. You tell me how that's possible with one shooter. Midwest. Go ahead. Your turn. Um, I dunno sir. Hands. Her hand was a Buddhist who killed a biggie. He ate flowers

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       or Tupac.

Speaker 2:          02:15:29       Do you even follow those kinds of things are not there. You don't debunk. Begin to pop because they're black. Is that what you're saying? So you're racist. Wait a minute. You go all the way to back my shaft. K before your time. JFK is not before your time, but big. He is. How dare you. You fucked it. People don't bring a biggie. You are hanging out with white people. You're hanging out with white people in Venice. It's big with English accents and go to art galleries. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. There is the generally wine. Well that's one of the things you said on a show. That's what he, what do you, what do you get? What do you find when you look at for the Sasquatch? I'll tell you, we don't find black people. No black people. There's not one. We were, me and Dunkin formed a group while we were out squash and called unfuckable white dudes and it was me and him and those two dudes.

Speaker 2:          02:16:13       And we were uh, we were out there steady squash and that was our band. He unfuckable white dudes. What about, what about Ufo? Because that's actually another thing he can't really deep on because a lot of them are just identify flying objects though that lights in the sky and he'd done it. What to do we have any pictures? Do we have any pictures that are really, really convincing? All of them. Oh, we don't pull shit. Listen, this guy's, it's a shill. He's a shell. The information, look at that drawing. Okay, look at this statue that I have. That's a real alien. Tell me. If you look at that in your heart and your soul, you know that, that to be really alien. I think there might be, it's an archetype. There's almost let less Ufo pitchers coming out now than they were back in the late fifties and people are scared to speak their mind because of ridicule.

Speaker 2:          02:16:54       Okay. Because people like Kim, what they've done is they've, they've made it seem like you're a silly person. Yeah. If you send in your photos, you're turning out mic while I'm, I'm assuming this was show need some balance. You're trying to create controversy and conflict. Basically what I'm telling you, Bryan, calendars and aliens are real. Roswell happened. I am stopped trying to deny it. I just need some proof. Sir. There's no proof necessary. I know. You need to know is that the, the sky is huge. That's true way. That is something I never really think about it just how vast the university is. It's someone's high. I never really think about how big the universe is talking about this. Why does it, why do they always look like that? I do you know the story that comes from the Fifties Duncan Trussell told me this story.

Speaker 2:          02:17:43       He said that when you are being born, okay. People assume that when you're being born you have no memory of uh, your, your, your childhood. But why would we assume that just because you don't have a context to put that memory into just because the one of the most traumatic moments of doubt, young brains, life we'll be getting yanked out of its warm, incredible environment of love with it's mommy and then taking it into some bright clinical place where a man is hovering over you with complete control. You can't move your body. You're being lifted up and carry to this tray and dropped down. You're looking down at this guy who's got this white mask on these black eyes and the archetype of this man's face when your eyeballs have never even adjusted to being able to see reality. I mean, you're not looking, you're not popping out of a fucking of vagina filled with liquids and blood and then seeing crystal clear, right.

Speaker 2:          02:18:34       My eyes are blurry when I get out of the fucking shower, right? When you get out of the pool, if you've been swimming a public pool, your eyes turn rent. Do you imagine what your eyes must look like being in gallons of vagina fluid for nine months? Blind close, but they open up there in the water. There's a lot of shit going on. You don't know. You don't know if they're open to there. I don't know. Megan shutout blood and then the pressure of that pussy squeezing on your head. All of that's going to fuck up your vision. It's supposed to be, if it's, it's a pussy. If you're going to have sex with it, and if you didn't have sex with it, she wouldn't have a baby. You're coming out of it. It's a vagina. Once you have sex with it, it's a to, it's not bad that it's supposed to. It's supposed to. It's not bad if it's your daughter, it's a vagina, and if it's your wife even have to just set up baby. It's opposing. The baby came out of the pussy, the baby staring at this alien, and that that image is somehow shocked. The image, the memory of the clinical experience, and it really does kind of make sense that these

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       ideas that people have of this hypnotic regression bringing up this, this alien abduction experiences that completely of squashed well, what is, what would be a traumatic moment that you really did squash? How about your birth, your fucking birth, getting shot in for the light. It's impossible light that you never could have imagined. Then nine months you've been alive and the x amount of time you've actually been thinking about things a lot more aliens wearing masks. If a, that was good. I don't think there's a real image. I think that's why the owl, the eyes are dark and the rest of the features are sort of nonexistent. Or maybe it's just somebody who to the flood, but that's just an artist's image. The actual, what the reoccurring inch is actually the eyes, the, the variation in the face and other people describe it being abducted by aliens.

Speaker 5:          02:20:15       They all described kind of a similar, it's a very similar archetype and the question is, is, is that archetype because of culture? Because like, you know, like people see big foot, right. The idea is that that's what they're looking for us because that's what everybody's told them to go look for like flying saucers. That's one where the, uh, the guy who first reported flying saucers was a fighter pilot and he reported these things skipping across the sky and said that there were like saucers on a lake, like someone skipping a saucer and that, but that he didn't mean even saucer shaped. They were actually a boomerang shape. That what he was saying that he saw. It sounds like he fell that everybody after that started seeing saucers, they started seeing actual discs. Why? Because that had been putting image that had been put in their hands.

Speaker 5:          02:20:59       I was going to say, that's interesting. You know, he may have been totally sleep deprived and completely hallucinating or on meth or whatever. They were given pilots, man, they were giving pilots meth for a long time. We went over on the show recently how much math was involved in the kamikaze pilots, how much math was involved in the Nazis and I'm awake and it was, people didn't even know it was bad for you then. Like there's people that doctors are prescribing math at. Doctors were taking a methamphetamine in medical school. Yes. So it's not outside the realm of possibility. This guy really did see disks flying through the sky. It's also not outside the realm of ability. Realm of possibility. This guy was tripping his fucking balls off on some government shit. No sleep. The earliest version of pro vigil they had, they're pumping into this fucking guy or pro vigil really works.

Speaker 5:          02:21:50       It is explained to me. Do you know it's not a, it's not a, it's not a central nervous stimulant. Actually. It's something else. It keeps it, I can't explain it because like as I am not an architect, I'm also not a doctor. I would give you a fucked up explanation of what it is. But, um, there's some people that swear by it, some Weirdos, you know, I had a doctor to, to who was at sleep specialist. I sat next to him by coincidence at dinner and he said it to, he was explaining how it worked, but he said it's not a stimulant away. Caffeine would be a stimulant. It just keeps you awake for 14 hours and you can function highly on. What's really interesting

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       is it was first created as a performance enhancing drug, mental performance enhancing drug. But they couldn't market it that way because the government's like, no, you can't have a drug that just makes your brain work better. Like you have to have a reason, you have to be an ailment that you're treating. And so they said, okay, narcolepsy. Oh Wow. And so then they started prescribing it for narcolepsy or off brand or how would they say, what does it off, off label, off label, off label use. So, so we'll provigil kind of center your mind. Well I'll tell him, let Brian describe it cause I gave one to Brian was about to fucking fall asleep once he had two hours sleep. And he was driving to San Diego. He's like, dude, I don't know how I'm going to do it. I go take this. And I don't, I, I'm very judicious with them.

Speaker 2:          02:23:06       I only take them when I need, when I haven't had sleep, when I need energy for a long sustained period of time. Like occasionally, if I'm feeling entitled, take a half a one before a UFC and it doesn't give you any speediness to it. It's not like drinking red bull. It's not like you're anything, it just, it gives you like less dips in your energy. It just turns you on. Like it's just like, that's not even a like tiredness or, or just like, like where I just need to lay down for a bid or just like, eh, but it's all gone. As Tim Ferriss said, he doesn't believe in a biological free lunch and it's, it's, it seems to have like a really positive benefit, which also makes me think like, well, okay, what, is there anything bad going on here because of this? Like just seems like seems like a pretty abusive, well, yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          02:23:49       That's very important. But also I'm, I don't take it very often and only take a half of one. I never go all in. I don't need it. I just think like a little bit, just a little bit as good. I don't want to feel like Ooh, like an effect. But if you take a full one, you'll feel like a blue, like a little bit of a rush. And I know, um, that it's a, a big rumor among silica, silicon valley startups that like all these guys who just provigils out of their mind and they have massive energy to complete projects that work at 16 hours a day and they're all just fucking pop and provigil and there's no bodies, you know, and people are really worried about so much so that Tim Ferriss kept it from his book. I go, why'd you leave it on your book goes, I don't want people just chewing on it like candy.

Speaker 2:          02:24:30       I was like, wow, it's so effective that you were worried about your own responsibility or personal responsibility for intro introducing it to people. Tim Ferriss, a good guy. Yeah. Well, I've heard of the same with the disastrous side effects for Adderall. And I have actually seen people that I've been friends with have had problems with Adderall. Adderall is no joke. I was awful. I mean if you split it down to like little teeny pieces, it might be okay. But like you take one Adderall pill, you feel like you're on crack cocaine. Like I feel like I get drips, like I'm having flashback from doing coke back cause it's that same feeling tuning into that feeling. Wow. Yeah. That Adderall thing though is a real issue with folks. Okay, here's a conspiracy. I'm with that. What do you think about, do you think that the government conspires with pharmaceutical companies to prescribe certain amounts of drugs so they can profit off of it? I think that is certainly like a big problem with leather regulation of drugs like this, this big revolving door of people in government and the

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       regulatory agencies who basically worked in industry and then they go work in the government and then there's the same people passing laws and regulations, uh, forward.

Speaker 5:          02:25:34       See, see what the financial industry, that's the real conspiracy or the EPA and Monsanto. Did you ever see the, um, um, there's a show on, I want to say it's current, but no, it's not. It's um, uh, vanguard, the oxycontin express. Have you ever seen that? Uh, that the special, it's, it's available online. You could see it online and uh, we've had the folks in that created it, I forget what network they were on. Sorry. Current was it current? Yeah. Um, and they showed the oxycontin problem in Florida and how easy it is to get pills and how crazy it is. They, they didn't have a database where you can go from one doctor to another and just keep getting prescriptions. They have these pain management centers set up everywhere where you go. Literally, they go, oh, my back hurts, Dr. Write some shit down in the same building.

Speaker 5:          02:26:20       They have a pharmacy that only sells pain pills and these people just cranked to the gills on Oxycontin's all day. Well, there's no, there's no question that I think corporations will sometimes if they want to get something passed, I mean the food industry will stack the deck with its scientists that they put on their payroll to suggest, for example, that the foods that they're producing, which are simple sugars and you know, whether it's craft or something and they want to sell soda, they want to sell candy bars in school, well they'll stack the deck and have signed to say 25% of your diet as a child can be simple sugars. We've, we don't find anything unhealthy about that. They've been very active about that. If you read the China study, t Colin Campbell, who's a scientist, I mean he's a Vegan and stuff. I don't agree with that. But like I said, yeah, but he's, he's incredible. Is incredible scientist who, who would have the value of that book for me was just Wah list reading about how they stack the deck, how they're very influential on the kinds of scientists that set standards. This is like a,

Speaker 4:          02:27:22       it's kind of like a real conspiracy, but it doesn't have to be like, you know, a bunch of guys in a smoky room like deciding to do these things. It's just kind of a bunch of increments. The, they push things in one direction or the other

Speaker 5:          02:27:32       and it's based on, you know, you can look at it, the influence very clearly. And it's like, where's the money coming from? It's just Monday. I called you after I read the book and I remember I just had to talk somebody. I go, I remember I called and I said, I don't know how people can make a living this way. I can never pay my mortgage behaving that way. When you were talking to me about the, you called me up and we were telling me about the richest county, uh, the, the county in Virginia. It's all lobbyists. It's all lobbyists and lawyers. I mean that the Washington has become an economy of influence. So crazy. I mean, by the way, I'm sorry to use that expression, but that's my trademark. Uh, don't, don't, don't, don't trademark. No trouble. But, but, but the, when you work on Capitol Hill now and you're a congressman and you're making 140 grand a year or whatever it is, it is the, that is the farm league for k street.

Speaker 5:          02:28:21       All the lobbying firms are where you go now. You use your influence after being in government for six or eight years. You now move to a lobbying firm just down the way on k street and now you're making five, six, $700,000 a year to use the influence and the contacts that you have made as a congressman to influence government for the, for the firm. You're working for it. Yeah. I think that's the biggest problem in America right now because I don't think you can really address it at the other problems until he takes care of that.

Speaker 1:          02:28:49       Well, I have a friend working on a possible option and the option instead of trying to attack campaign finance and its current form, offer another option and that other option being the internet and that the Internet, you could have people that were funded by like crowdsource Kickstarter style and have people that are promoting certain ideas funded and that being like doing it that way, you could have a, it's a massive resource of human beings. We're talking about 300 million human beings, which you really will have access to for the first time as opposed to if you're trying to do it like in any other form. Like when Ross Perot came around, they decided to tighten the game up completely because he fucked up everything. That's the reason why Clinton became president in the first place because Ross Perot came around and threw a giant monkey wrench in the whole Republican side of things and they said, we cannot let that happen again.

Speaker 1:          02:29:40       So the commission for presidential debates is a privately funded institution decided to change their standards. So how many people have to like you before you're allowed to be in the debate, like you have to have a giant percentage of the popular vote to be able to get into the debate. Well, that's the rub is you can't get it and so you can get into the debate so you can't get it and you can't get it. So go fuck yourself. Yeah. Well this idea would be another option. Would that be you? Would the, the people that are their hamstring because they don't have enough money. If someone was dedicating their time to creating like a real network of politicians who are sourced like entirely by the public and accountable for all the different things that they're saying that they're going to represent once they get in there. The thing I worry about that

Speaker 5:          02:30:23       the thing, I have a problem, what worries me is that you're still then having congressmen spending 40 50% of their time raising funds and I would like the government to set a or someone to set a limit and, and, and Dole out money to all candidates equally.

Speaker 1:          02:30:40       Oh, that's horse shit. They're now worth equal. Do you think that equal that come on man. Do you think that or like think of all the crack heads like Rick Santorum that ran for president. I think that motherfucker deserves equal money. Well it was crazy. He was the one to stop gay marriage. Crazy people that think that the earth is less than 10,000 years old. They get the money too.

Speaker 5:          02:30:59       You get those people getting involved when he, because corporations like will side with people who uh, have their interests are how often it might be Rick Santorum

Speaker 1:          02:31:07       maybe. And maybe I'm hoping that the general public will catch up to the idea that that's a good idea. Yeah, you're right. That's some prompts on the Internet as a source. Like that is to me another option outside of the corporations that hasn't been addressed yet. We've got to change that. I think that is the, the gap for me, that is the biggest problem. And that's one of the things that I like when people ask me like, you know, what are the real problems? I started out with campaign finance reform. Yes, yes. That's huge. And then you know when you have all this crazy spine going on, but no real, I mean, what's the real danger? What's really going on? Where's the, the massive amount of terrorism that we're experiencing in our country on a regular basis that we need to take over people's People's privacy, that we need to be able to fish through everyone's email and get metadata on every phone call you make.

Speaker 1:          02:31:51       Where's the fucking evidence that there's any need for all this stuff? I say there's very little, and I say it's one of those things, it's a natural progression. When a girl blows you, you want to stick it in her ass. It's just what happens. You want to see if you could do that too. When a girl is willing to have sex with you, will she blow you when a girl jerks you off? Can we now have sex? It's just there's a normal thing. You steal $5 at work, can I still 20 you know, you, you, you figure out a way to do things more to get things more. And that applies to everything that human beings do it history of government is that that to get to gain more control and if they've got the power to, to look into people's emails, they're like, well, let's just get all everyone's email that they ever do ever.

Speaker 1:          02:32:30       It's that way. We can always have them on any, and it's, it's, it's against the, everyone wants to say that, well, the constitution should be a living document. It should change with the times, you know, there's, we have a nuclear bombs now. There's a lot of real issues that people need to deal with. They didn't have to deal with when the constitution was written, but yes, but the constitution, what's interesting about it is that it's a skeleton form of a government that people were trying to construct after. The governance that they had seen had failed miserably because they were all right darkies they were dictating. So it was more, it was psychologically based as well. It understood the nature of man. That's right. And those, those, those fail safes that were put in place and when they were establishing the early government, when they were trying to separate church and state, what they were trying to do was make it so that you couldn't have cults of people with influence that just controlled vast parts of the world.

Speaker 1:          02:33:24       Exactly ended eventually happened just like they thought it was going to. So well, the constitution just in that form should be respected. Even if you don't want to, you know, you don't want to limit it to what was written in the constitution because now we have wireless internet and all this other crazy shit. He's still have to think they, they saw corruption coming. They were right. Ben Franklin said that the legend goes, he came out and after they've formulated the constitution and they said, what if the woman said, what have you done? And he said, well, we've created a republic madam, if you can keep it, you know, it was always precarious. You know, when you write about conspiracy theories or breakdown conspiracy theories, um, do you feel an obligation to also expose people to shit that actually is legitimate? That does need concern? That I do to a small extent, but the so many of the people doing the uh, the, the, you know, I can just kinda point them to the other sites like

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       campaign finance reform. There's loads of things out there. So I didn't really feel the need. I think like, because I'm doing a very good job at debunking stuff, that's where I focus my efforts.

Speaker 1:          02:34:29       Totally agree. I think you're doing a great job, but I also feel like you take an exorbitant amount of negative energy then like I've seen these debates that you get online with these people just on Twitter when you jumped on Twitter, I watch you for days. I was coming in here to the office while we were filming the show and I was like, he is still going at it with these motherfuckers and you never lost your patients. You were all these people are calling you a government shill. They're asking you how much you get paid by the government. And he just kept throwing up like, you know, this one asks a question, he would give a scientific explanation, throw up a link, and then they would just be like, ah, fuck flappable got to flappable British gentlemen.

Speaker 3:          02:35:09       And that's something that people like to use it against me. They said, I'm too unflappable.

Speaker 1:          02:35:12       Oh, I must be a fermentation because I'm not saying fuck you to everybody. You can't win. It's really important that we look at the truth, the real truth, not the truth that you want to see, but the actual real truth. And there's, uh, there's a lot of complexities to this life and there's complexities to the mind that we perceive this very life with. And that's a real issue. There has to be managed like the constitution was trying to manage the idea of the psychological nature of man in, in a, in the form of making government. You have to kind of manage your, your own mind in terms of how certain situations can be defended that don't necessarily make sense. You and I talk about this all the time. I mean a lot of times you've got to face up to when you're lying or lying to even to yourself, you've got to face up to kind of like, oh man.

Speaker 1:          02:35:55       I've been kind of telling myself a story here and actually my good friend over here has just told me that I got to take a look at that. That's what a real friend does, right? When you go home, that's something I'm not going to actually reassess some. You know I love Michael Schirmer's quote. If you've read them, I'm doing myself a great disjustice injustice, but bring up Michael Shermer right now because I'll be a rape apologist because I don't know if you know about this. He was accused of doing something improper, improper meaning getting a girl drunk and having sex with her. Crazy that people are calling that a lot of people are calling that rape man. I ain't never done that. I don't know if that happened. I don't know what happened getting her drunk. So my point is that I just needed to address that just to put it out there. But the, the quote that is that he has is that lots of people that are very smart believe dump things because they can explain them and they can argue them very well. And so they think they're doing well and winning in the argument. So that may be their point. Makes Sense. But it really becomes like a sort of circular ego argument. Sounds,

Speaker 3:          02:36:55       sounds good. They've got a good sounding occupant to be, you know, you talked to like Michael Murphy and uh, he, he's very eloquent. Yes. It used to be, it's a bit less eloquent now. It's, but he, he, you know, he's very convincing. He's very personable person and you know, you can easily get sucked into things like that. And then you start repeating the same arguments yourself and you're convincing because if you are an eloquent person, you're eloquent to yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:37:18       Well, it's also in being a smart person and most of us are at least somewhat competitive. We want to be right. And it's what you were talking about earlier about certain skeptics being aggressive and they use skepticism as a game. W Ciao. Tallying up a social score.

Speaker 3:          02:37:35       Yeah. It becomes a debate, uh, in the old fashioned sense of a debate where it's like one person has to argue this, the other person argues the opposite thing and then they fight it out and the best debater winds, it becomes about debating rather than about finding what is true and what is not true. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:37:50       Yeah, that's, that is a real problem with, uh, being able to,

Speaker 3:          02:37:54       to, to put it all aside and actually like, look at what the fuck is really going on. They end up saying things that are wrong because the, the too hasty to come up with an explanation for things. So they'll end up like, you know, just saying, you know, oh, that's, that's not cool. That's not a chem trail. That's a smoke from the plains. Because because that's the first thing that comes into the hat because they're that debunkers and they think that if they can think of something, they've got that thing where you know they think they are intelligent and they are somewhat intelligent but people fool themselves as to how intelligent they actually are. So even in debunkers can you get caught? Oh yeah. Yeah, it is their own to seats. It's very, it's very annoying from my perspective as well because I get people coming onto my site and then they try to debunk things but that they say things that are wrong but it's scientifically wrong and then you have to end up like correcting the debunkers as well.

Speaker 1:          02:38:41       Oh well that ever ends NTD bunkers, we agree there are a lot of Conti d cause quite a few, you know. Sure. It's easily, to me it's easy to be when you're also frustrated with your own vision of the world and then when someone comes along saying they have fucking documented proof to loch ness monster is real and you're like the fuck you do shit head right. You don't, it's hard. It's hard to say what is it was Sarah, what is this proof where we have you got this proof stored? Right. May I measure it?

Speaker 3:          02:39:11       Yeah. That sounds like the evidence you were asking for in that the Ufo thing last night. Yeah, a couple of days ago. It's, yeah, they don't have evidence. They have eyewitness tetanus testimony or they have like crappy photos.

Speaker 1:          02:39:22       There's no empirical evidence. There's not nothing that sort of like, let's, let's see some measurable evidence. Well, let me tell you this. After chem trails, which was the number one most hate I got from anything I've ever done online, so many people thought it was a shill. And uh, number two was aliens. And the idea that I could debunk like this one place and it wasn't even deep bunked this one place, sky was just telling me some crazy shit and I didn't buy it. It's really simple when you talk to me about bulletproof wolves and missed, and if I don't buy it, it doesn't mean I'm an asshole. Okay. It means I'm trying to be real about this. I think it's much more likely that there's intelligent life in the universe than it is that there isn't, I think it's much more likely. But I also think there's a lot of shit that people are seeing.

Speaker 1:          02:40:10       Like we were talking about these orbs people keep seeing in this area around, um, this ranch is little ranch, which is in Utah, northern Utah. Well there's, it's potentially ball lightning, like bald lightening is a very real phenomenon that's been measured and it's really weird. Like it can stay around for several seconds sometimes and people see it darting around doing crazy shit. And if you didn't expect to see that and all of a sudden you did see it and you're trying to put it into context and you're looking at something that's so fantastic, but it's really just a phenomenon of nature. You could convince yourself that you're looking at something that is being controlled by an alien life force. And my problem is really simple. I know people are full of Shit. So when I meet one that might be full of shit, I go, well, he might be full of Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:40:57       It's really that simple. It's not like lying is something that doesn't exist. It's not like a lot of people don't lie. No. The evidence is that a lot of people do just make up stories and when someone has, you know, just like the guy who's looking at the fucking people that he's about to shoot and sees it twitching motherfucker that knows he's hopped up on adrenaline. Yep. You also, as a person, especially a person who's brutally honest with yourself, recognize very easy when someone has no emotional connection to the words that are coming out of their mouth. This is not a real incident that they're reciting. This is not a real thing that took place. This is a person that's telling me a stupid story that sucks and it's insulting. It's insulting to me that you think I'm so fucking dumb that this is the week game you're playing on me.

Speaker 1:          02:41:41       Just like some asshole coming up to the most beautiful woman in the world and trying to convince her that he's a prince. Right? Right. Yeah. That shit is insulting and gotten my AA. What do you gotta do it? Right? My point is it's insulting and it's a problem with the, the whole community of quote unquote believers. It's the problem is not that there are, there's no way there's Ufo is it's impossible. The problem is most people tell Shitty fucking stories that don't have any evidence behind them. They don't have anything. And it's interesting when they tell you these stories and if it is real wow, amazing that the aliens came and took you and they look just like every other alien from Steven's Spielberg's close encounters of the third time on and it took you in space. This is very common among people who take religion at literal value.

Speaker 1:          02:42:33       When you see people who interpret the Bible literally and stuff like that sort of, but no, because these people are talking about personal experiences. They're having personal experiences that way too, and they have conversions or I'm reborn and I had, I saw Jesus. You hear a lot of that, right? But you hear much more of people being abducted by aliens. Then you do have people having religious experiences and I think that goes right back to the whole flying saucer thing. I think people are in their head thinking that they're going to be abducted by aliens and so when they are sleeping, which is when all these fucking things take place, they all take place the middle of the night and they'll tell, you know, a lot of abductions take place during the day. You know what else happens during day? Sometimes naps. Yeah. These people conk out at work and they think they lost time cause you're fucking drew blood on your shirt. Stupid, right? You're not in a space ship. You're not special. You're gonna fucking cubicle and you're not the person that the people from Alpha Centauri have talked to and convinced that you're going to be able to have the solution for saving the human race out of your fucking cubicle. You're nodding off every day. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:43:33       Is that reaction you get when you disbelieve somebody? Oh, you just, just skeptical about them is that they think that you're being, you know that you're judging them, but really you're just being, you know, being somewhat scientific about it. No, that's you. I'm judging them and they were doing very different things, but they claim to be very open minded, but really the pretty much the opposite of open minded because they will only believe that there are particular interpretation of results and they think because they're interpretation is different from everybody else's. That means that they are being open minded just means that's a very, very narrow minded outside

Speaker 1:          02:44:03       incredibly butthurt. If you call them on it, God damn it. No one's more butthurt then conspiracy theorist, if you disagree with them, it gets emotional. So God damn fast. Out of all the things that have disagreed with with people, whether it was a controversial issues like males changing transgendered female getting to fighting, nothing got people more pissed off than the chem trail thing. Yeah, that's amazing to me. Amazing. Amazing. In that sense, it kind of feels as though they're, they're less concerned about chem trails are just an excuse to garner around an issue that makes them feel like there's a fight to be had. It's real simple. They're lazy. They're only taking a few steps for taking a few steps and looking at things and then the defending that position to get into that position and then they rocked up position hard. The really nutty, aggressive people that are going after people on law and you fuck government shoe, like you just guts go and look at what the fuck you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:44:55       It doesn't mean the government didn't organize Northwoods. The government was at the Joint Chiefs of Staff signed a document saying they were going to fucking bomb Guantanamo Bay. They're going to arb, cumin friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay. That's a real, didn't happen. But people do try to do shit and when you pretend that something's happening, that's not happening. You cheapen everything where there's really something going on or the burden of proof is on you to prove what you're saying you, you can't just come out and say a bunch of stuff and not have any anything I can. But you're talking logical.

Speaker 3:          02:45:26       Yeah. The the the theorists, they also, they, they go into things in too, a lot of breadth but not depth. So once you've debunk something, they don't actually like, you know, tried to come back on that thing. They just move onto the next thing. So you've got this, this long, long lists of hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of pieces of evidences. Uh, but I've an interesting, but any one, you can go into any depth. You could actually prove absolutely. That is not true. But they, as soon as you start to get in there, they will just drop it and they'll move on to the next.

Speaker 1:          02:45:53       Yeah. It becomes a, it becomes a weird thing in your head. That's actually really interesting though, that they just want it to be real.

Speaker 3:          02:45:59       Hi, this is this one guy who thinks that a UV radiation is really, really high at the moment. And he has these, these readings that you did with this crappy cheap meters that he had. This is the chem shell dude. Yeah. You debated, this

Speaker 6:          02:46:10       is a 70 minute transcription, a 70 minute debate. It's really fascinating. He read the whole thing. Yes. Yeah. I read it off. Yeah. So he, he basically started, I got problem. He thinks that there's so much radiation coming down that it's actually the levels is measuring is more than they're actually using in space. Well it was interesting. I need to watch the actual video because I could picture it taking place like when you would call them on things and he had literally no response to like the, you know, the, the differences that you guys had between, you know, what was uh, what was actually happening with the sky and what was actually been proven. Like these kind of no evidence he's saying these claims. It went from one thing to the next one. You will say, well what about the gaps in contracts and explaining what they say.

Speaker 6:          02:46:52       Oh, what about these things coming off the back of Casey tends and I would explain what that is. And then you were talking about the UV radiation. That was when things got really weird. It was like you were saying like where's the results? Like where are the medical results of this changing, this dangerous change in the environment if the levels go away. He said, and he's like, they were it like 20 times normal UVB. Which is what causes like skin cancer on sunburn. Just reading. It was just like a picture of the pausing and the panic in the room. It was so crazy. It's like used to be, he deserves to be of course, but he was very, very eloquent and very well spoken when he, when he debated is extremely competent in his viewpoint, but it was this very narrow viewpoint and it would just stick to his point and he would keep going off on this long litany is where he would repeat his like 12 talking point.

Speaker 6:          02:47:37       Yeah, it's real. It's actually scary. That's almost a sociopath. Somebody doesn't is not even emotional about it, but rather just kind of like he wants emotional though. He was, he was very passionate about this. Not that Brian, it's just, it's complete conviction in their stupid idea. It's confirmation bias to its extreme and complete conviction. And I in an idea that doesn't rejection of, of people like me, like not just reduction of you, but a reduction of contradictory evidence period. Yeah. Because I'm the, I'm going to a person who's actually giving them that contradictory evidence and he's totally convinced that I'm a paid shill. Yeah. He's, he's it done this long. Are you sure you're not a paid shill? A you do, you get checks every week and go, where'd that come from? My wife complains about me spending money on my web hosting because it's, you know, it's coming out of our budget.

Speaker 6:          02:48:22       So you used to run like a computer game companies that we, yeah. Yeah. I never saw the Tony Hawk video games. And you sold that and then you decided once you sold out that you were just going to go into hibernation. Uh, and I, I stayed there for a few years and then I just thought I'd go off and do other things and ended up doing a debunking. I didn't leave to go debunking that. Just what I ended up doing. What you used to own? Never soft. That's what he says. Oh, that is amazing. Tony Hawk, we, we grew up with Tony Hawk and everything like that. It's one of my favorite was one of my favorite companies is distraction that you created. Cool. I would talk to you about never saw fall day. So you own, you own that company and sold it and then a thought of it. Oh Wow. Awesome. So when you decided to kick back and you know, not work anymore after he sold it, how did

Speaker 1:          02:49:07       you get started in this whole debunking thing? Did it, was it start with one issue?

Speaker 3:          02:49:11       Yeah, it started with the on Wikipedia and I was doing crap about biblical scientific for knowledge and that was just kind of me doing my, my naive debunker guy where I saw something that was wrong. So I started like typing a bunch of stuff that's wrong and I'm going issue to issue, uh, like point to point and just like slapping them down and then I moved on to more gallons, which uh, you know, you did.

Speaker 1:          02:49:33       Yeah, we covered much more, more jealous in the show then we got the chance to put in because of the limitations that it was [inaudible] file apocalypse thing. Most likely it's this two things, most likely some people they have a an issue with. They're cutting their skin open and sticking things in there and there, there, there, there are people that have that, but there's also a bunch of people that have Lyme disease and they think it's hyperkeratinization might be occurring Lyme disease apparently when a tick bites you. And this is the most recent thing from the more gentleman's conference that I went to an Austin up this year. So w what they call their studies or science. I don't know who's right or who's wrong. Stigmata but there's no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The more challenge is a disease where they get these fibers that are growing out of their skin. Um, what, what the doctors that have at claim is that it's Lyme disease and they all test positive for Lyme disease apparently. And hyperkeratinization, which is some sort of a side effect of something that comes along with the Lyme disease. And the idea is that the tick is not just carrying one pathogen, it's probably carrying several and some of them even undiagnosed. So it pygmies or a piggy backs rather along with Lyme disease. This is what the doctors had habit belief.

Speaker 3:          02:50:39       Well yeah, but those are the same guys that basically kind of invented it in the first place. That, that one guy that you told her, that kind of twitchy guy. Yes. Uh, he invented it and they didn't invent it, but he was part of the Morgellons research foundation, which doesn't exist anymore, which is an original group of people who kind of like promoted it and got it into the, into the media, uh, back about, you know, six, seven years ago when I got the CDC to investigator when really it isn't very much evidence to say that it is a distinct disease at all. So that was, that was kind of what I was debunking was that the people saying the walls evidence, the, the, some thing going on when really there wasn't it.

Speaker 1:          02:51:12       So these doctors that are saying that this is hypercare team, we're running out of time,

Speaker 6:          02:51:17       uh, about four minutes. Dammit. We could go on about this forever. I really need to talk to you about this because this is quite fascinating because they were having me convinced that it's something to do with Lyme disease. Yeah. Not The big theory. Like what, but one of the doctors, what are they getting these sores all over their body? Then what do you think it is? It's a neurotic excoriation systemical to investigate the scratching themselves, but how they do it in spots on their back that can't even read it. They can. They can. Those photos of people who happened, your Arctic explorations on the back of the day, they match exactly the patterns of the people who, uh, who have, what about the people that show these extra hairs that are coming out? They've taken photographs of these like five and six clumps of hair that are like popping out of these areas what they're calling hyperkeratinization. You think that's bullshit too? No, that's probably just a normal dermatological condition. Like people just, they have articles and get, but they're saying that that's occurring and a lot of their little sores. Yeah. Now that that's just a lot of those just fibers

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       getting caught in this and we're going to have to do this again sometime. God dammit. Yeah, we have too much shit to talk about. We can keep going on. I'll talk to you about just more jealous for the next 20 minutes and people were like, Yay. People at the, on the, on the uh, treadmills right now. I'm going, yeah, I was hoping you were going to talk about festering fucking diseases of the skin. I can, there's 20 minutes to class next. I'll listen man. It's been very interesting. Thank you very much. Let's do it again for sure. Come back and we'll find some more shit to do. Bunk and hopefully I can get somebody who believes in chem trails that believes that government is spraying. There is evidence to come here and do it. I tried but they all passed or the one that I tried that I reached out to past.
