Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Doon doon, Doon Doon, Doon Doon doon teaching dunk in the ways of windows laptop. Fucking love it. Max Keyboards can go fuck themselves. Those are terrible keyboards. They're not designed for comfort and writing. This whole idea of getting thinner man get thinner and thinner. So it's a piece of paper and it magically unfolds that expanse the right side. This is fucking. This is not too thick. Yeah. How come they can do it? Well, how come you guys can't do it? Why? How come you only offer one shitty ass fucking keyboard? Find out if your map will qualify for apples. Keyboard repair program. I don't want you to repair the same shitty keyboard. I want you to make a real keyboard where you have like, it's got like a little bit of a u shape to it. Where you finger that goes into the center. What does that call? How do they describe that?

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       And the keys have like a little, a little bit of a dip to them. And then in the middle you feel where they are? Yeah. Dimpled. Perhaps you feel where they are. They have travel so your fingers know what's going on. You get tactile feedback, more tactile feedback. Then this little clickety click thing, which might as well be. You might as well be doing it on an ipad. You know you have an ipad keyboard and it kind of works, but it kind of doesn't because your fingers are all feeling the same thing every time. One individual buttons and give you individual feedback so you don't have to think about what's happening. You could just think about the words.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       It feels like this. They hired an alien at apple that forgot that. Humans like to push buttons. We like it. It feels good. It feels good though. They're. They're ignoring like a basic human drake, which is like, have you seen those dumb cubes? Nervous people get. They've got like buttons and Shit and you spin it around. It's the same thing. It's like gives you this tactile little thing where you take all that extra energy and you put it in your. In your stress ball. Your people liked it. Punch, impress and click and switch and that's what apple forgot. It's like when I'm typing man, I like that. I like like in the shining. When you hear that means I'm typing. I like the sound, the flutter of the keys as you're writing that fucking apple keyboard. Man. When I went in I was so ready to buy a brand new Mac book pro, so excited. Really excited like five minds from like 2014 or 2015. I mean, not to like be in fucking apple fanboy, but I will say that when I, when I went in there with it instead of trying to sell me the new Mac book, she looked at it and was like, what are you doing on the thing? And I'm like, oh, I edit sound. And she was like, Ma, I don't know that you, that you even need a new and outside of the fact that it's new. Whoever you are, young lady

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       Odin

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       blesses you and blesses you and blesses you for your, your, your truth. Yeah. Yeah. It was for your wisdom,

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       dude. I was so shocked. I always tell them to eat. We don't need the computing power. I was stunned, man, because like I've never in that, that moment is kind of made me perpetually love apple because they're training their employees not to like, just like pressure sell shit, but just to actually help the customer out of stock. She could sell you one. Anyway, she was just like, dude, you don't even want one. She's probably quitting. She's quitting. Just sick of her job for the last four days. She's been telling everyone no matter what they came in to buy it. She's like, you know, you don't need this. Her boss has been saying creepy shit to her. She's been ready to quit for a while. I was an asshole. Yeah, yeah. No. Okay. Mark. Okay. I'm going to go out in the floor and Mark Jessica, I've noticed your sales have gone to zero.

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Okay. Move those new laptops. Well, yeah, he sure. Mark. Mark's got a creepy wink. Yeah. Can you get away with that at work? What can you do now? What if you're like, hey, susie, make sure you have that copy done to personnel by two. No, can't do that. You can't wink and go, hey, you definitely can't do the gun. Nope. Unless you're doing it to everybody. If you're in a meeting, you could go pet. You're a mass shooter. Oh, I can't do it to one person, to a group of people. You can't make the finger gun anymore. The finger guns gone.

Speaker 2:          00:04:31       You can't do I, I, you know, I'm, we're both. We have cool jobs due to like, I have to imagine that that's gone. Like you know, my house, the finger guns, not guns. That guy shoot my dogs every day in front of my wife. I like looking at her cavaliers and being like, Bam, Bam. Now what? Now what?

Speaker 3:          00:04:53       I can't even play around. I love those done. It's like there's no room for new ones because there are crazy people to do shoot people. You can't pretend to shoot people anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       Dude, this is it man. This is exactly the fucking problem of being interconnected by technology is that we are paying for the sins of the, of the small percentile of absolute dumb ass is on the planet. And because of that there, you know, you know, anytime I look at a sign, any sign that's got like an obvious thing in it, don't, don't shed in the hot tub or like on the roller coaster, don't, don't get out of your seat. When I look at that, I think that's because a dumb, dumb dumb because there might be a person who's in the roller coaster, like, will be more fun. Didn't do it mean to do a southern accent. By the way, I'm from the south. I don't think they're all done.

Speaker 3:          00:05:51       This is too many people dogging. There's too many people talking in this world. Didn't use to be like that. This is a new thing

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       for the last 10 years. People started talking. Yeah. Nope. The, the average person didn't ever voiced 20 years ago. There's great things to anyone having a voice crate thing. Great, great things. But we're going to have to relearn human communication, right? We can't use the old rules for today. It just can't work. He can't work and it's too easy to be an asshole. People got to stop seeking that out. Like I the lashing out at people for no reason. It's so crazy how many people do it. You'll see someone post something and someone will be like, fuck you. You dumb piece of shit. Don't you realize that this is why this and why that any. You know, Steven Kotler, he's been on this show a few times. He's awesome and they're doing these, doing this new psychedelic study, psychedelics and flow states. So I retweeted a tweet because he, he's like, they're doing research right now.

Speaker 4:          00:06:57       They need people to fill out a survey. So I retweeted that to help steven out. Just like, ah, cool. Yeah, that's a cool thing. I think psychedelics probably do induce flow states. I'd like to find out for sure, but within like six comments, it's still up there if y'all want to look. Some dude wrote to me something on the lines of like, you're hurting people and don't even know it. That six down. It's like hurting people. I can't remember what language he used, but it's like, what the fuck you. This is a survey dude. Like what are you talking about? Like is it maybe he means by re tweeting surveys, that sucks because no one wants to see that on their timeline, but I think he meant you're hurting people by demystifying and de stigmatizing psychedelics. Little do you know you're fighting cruel funding. Funding cruelty.

Speaker 4:          00:07:51       I'll locally just said, huh? Because I want the explanation because it's like when someone says something like that, it's so terribly absolutely impossibly wrong from my reality tunnel that it's like I want to get narrow reality tunnel and here because that guy really that he believes it well or he's a troll. It could be he's a troll. It could be that each had terrible experiences with psychedelics. That's, you know, maybe he's one of those guys that had a real, you know, look, when people get really into something, they want everybody to get into it. I'm a terrible example that I'm telling everybody. Got Into Yoga, Yoga, do yoga. Yeah. This happens with, with everything. Oh, and people that get sober, like people that have a real problem to have. Like we all know someone who's gone off the deep end with drugs, right? When they come out of that, some folks turned into evangelists for sobriety. Yeah, and it gets super annoying. Yeah. One of the things they do is they demonize all positive experiences that we're with the

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       same substances, their negative experience, and they're fucking crazy head. They've decided because they had a bad trip. Every trip is bad. The millions of people tripping all over the world, taking mushrooms, finding God and love and companionship and harmony with the universe and an acceptance of their mortality. All that doesn't count because billy couldn't keep his shit together at the pink Floyd concert because this fucking asshole decided to eat the entire, the entire bag of mushrooms and he tripped his balls off and was screaming. They had to take her to the hospital any and he called his ex girlfriend and cried to her for hours and now her boyfriend, a new boyfriend wants to beat him up and he doesn't even remember doing it. Like, that guy guy's an idiot. Okay. There's a lot of those people out there. All lot of them, a whole lot of them and there's people that just aren't geared for psychedelics for whatever reason. You know, there's people that are really, really close to losing their shit with regular reality. For sure. For them it's not a good idea. It's not a good idea. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:09:58       That's definitely something that like in my old age, I want to put in like at Tallix and underlying. That's what you just said because when I was younger, when you're younger and you are in that evangelical part of your psychedelic life, you can become like, if you're not careful, ridiculous and irresponsible and you start throwing out there this like idea that is not only fundamentally wrong, it's fundamentally wrong in everything as far as I'm concerned, which is there's not really a one cure to your troubles. You know what I mean? So, but with psychedelics, people think this is the answer, this is the answer, this is it, this is what we need. And it's like, well, it's part of what some people need, but if you've got manic depression, for example, if you've got bipolar, you know, dude, I had this moment where this, uh, some parents came up to me and were dead tell you about this there.

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       They came in to talk to me. I'm at a show and they were like talking about how their kid, like my podcast. And it was really sad because he had been at one of my podcasts and I think he'd come onstage as a question or something or, and they were looking for a recording of the live show because they thought maybe they could hear him talk or get some, like as in laughter or something. But anyway, what happened was he, uh, I think he had some kind of. I'm bipolar, I'm not sure what, but he's one of my friends rave and he's like, is he uses the term gyro is gyro is off a little bit, you know, something was off a little bit. But anyway, the kid went and did Iowaska in Peru. He did a eight night or wanting to know how they're doing these. I don't know how they do it every night or every other night, eight retreat, drinking

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       the medicine every night and then after that went to some kind of like other shaman or some woman, I don't know who it was, I'm not sure of the dates, but then he came home and he jumped off a waterfall and killed himself because, because what had happened is he a man, he was in a manic state. It triggered a manic state, um, and he killed himself and, and, and that was Iowasca, you know, that's like the medicine, right? And, and so it just, for some reason I think some people are deemphasizing what it means to be healed by the psychedelic or to be worked on by a psychedelic or to enter into that state because it's becoming, thank God, a De stigmatized. Much more so. Do you remember how it was 20 years ago? Dude? It was. You couldn't even talk about it. Couldn't talk about it, couldn't mention it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:57       It was you. It was bad, bad, bad drugs. It was heroin. It was on the same level as like you, if you were taking Lsd, that was like heroin man, so people will look at you like you're crazy and then there's also, you know, there's real problems that people have with being tested at work. A lot of people get tested at work and people worried about losing their jobs, so drugs don't just become a thing where you could fuck up and you know and get addicted to them, but now they become a thing that could take away your livelihood, take away your livelihood. That's right. Check your pee. They put the state of paranoia on their employees. Just imagine that feeling. You're working for some office. You probably don't dig the GIG anyway, right? You don't even like it and they have to check your pass every now and then.

Speaker 4:          00:13:39       That didn't only, you know when. Duncan, can I see you for a moment? Hi. In high. It's that time of the year. Random drug tests. So I'm just going to have to go with you and watch you pull your penis out and put it into this cup and give me a little sample of your body fluids. Okay, baby. Okay. Yeah. That didn't work anymore. What if they figured a way around it so they had to collect your shit. I need to see you. Shit. See Your asshole opened up and I need to see that tube come out into this tupperware container. I'm going to be there. Yeah, that'd be. Thank God in a way. Thank God. That's how they detect drugs. Thank God it's through the pis. Thank God. Thank God. It's not like you, you know, like probably. I don't know this for sure, but I bet every asshole has a thumb print. Like you know, everybody has a different thumbprint. I bet if you took asshole prints, every human would also have like a different asshole print and like cheap. Imagine if that was true. If like you could see foot in fingerprints like oh look, it gives you the ingredients. This guy's like 60 percent asshole. It says that we just didn't look at this. No, I don't mean asshole. I mean the literal asshole. Oh, like if you take a person's asshole and put like and you're like, oh, like an asshole print. Like retina squinted on ink. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       it's the brown eye. Retina scan. Everyone. Wow. For sure. Probably the asshole as a thumbprint. It's just simply for sure. Sure. So if you took psychedelics and it caused that thumbprint and change a little bit and that's how they told where it's. They don't want to look at your shit. You just have to. They have to look at like you're either, they have to scan your ass in the print change. You didn't Mescalin whew, we're lucky it's in the piss. But. But also if you really think about the fact that we are in a world where people have to go to work to do a job, that by the way, man, if there is a dude you need to get on this podcast and there's a book that you would love. David Graber wrote this book called Bullshit Jobs. This guy is a fucking genius man in this book.

Speaker 2:          00:15:40       Bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena of how many, many people are working in jobs that don't do anything for the world or the company they're working for. And it's not like this judgmental thing where he's like, yeah, that's a bullshit job. You're a blah, blah, blah. He's one of the, he's like an anthropologist. So he's very precise. But one of the qualifications for your job to be a bullshit job is you know, that it's really kind of a worthless job. It's not really doing anything. And like companies have gotten so fucking big that, uh, they, they end up having like departments or people running departments or extra employees that don't really need to be there at all and they have to pretend to be, to work. That's what he writes about. He writes it that if you really want to torture a person, uh, not only give them, like the job of like, you know, pouring a glass of water and an empty glass and pouring it back, but then add to it that they have to deceive their boss into thinking that they're doing an important job or they lose their jobs.

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       So these not only are these, like some corporations and companies scanning your pes to see if you're taking a substance that is allowing you to connect with home what you actually are. They are also demanding that you spend many hours a day lying to them that you're doing work that you're not doing, like if you're fucking efficient, you know, and this is another thing I graybar writes about. Forgive me, David Graver, if in any way I've misconstrued as I read your writings stoned, but the, but the, the, um, the, the, the other fucking element to it that is absolutely atrocious and fucking horrible is that these substances are connecting us to home. They don't want us to be in those states and they're asking us to fucking lie all day. And you know what psychedelic means? The, the etymology of psychedelic. No, it means mind manifesting or soul manifesting, right?

Speaker 2:          00:17:55       So a psychedelic connects us potentially with the truth, what we are, our identity, right? And these companies, they're asking us to lie, to be the opposite of our identities, to wear weird a suit or, or some kind of dress code. And to sit in a desk where because you're efficient, you get your job done in 45 minutes and for the next six hours you got to sit and type in, pretend that you're working, knowing you're a person and knowing that this is like unethical, you're. But if you, if you like go and tell your boss, hey man, I don't really have much to do, you might get fired. The boss might like in the book he cites one person because he did like a survey and he cites one person who went to her boss and she's like, Hey, I can finish my job in two hours. I need, can I have other stuff to do? And her boss is like, don't talk about that. Stay quiet about that. Oh yeah man. That's the fucking world we're in right now because of automation. There's less to do. Computers are making shit fat. It's why are we were working the exact same amount of time we were when there were no computers, but you have to be there to get paid and you have to act like you're doing something or they can use.

Speaker 1:          00:19:12       Yeah. So many people right now are doing just that while the list of this a lot, a lot, and by the way, if you had to guess what percentage of people are listening right now that are really supposed to be doing some bullshit job and they're kind of sitting in front of their keyboard with earbuds on, just barely paying attention. Try not to get caught looking at porn.

Speaker 2:          00:19:35       Yeah, I probably an all over the planet at over a million. Over a million in the work

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       forest probably. When do you think companies had to put in rules? You can't look at porn at work. Like that wasn't a thing in the seventies who wasn't a thing in the eighties. It wasn't a thing in the nine, zero s then all the sudden you could just find porn online and people will. They have a work computer that's hooked up to the Internet. Like when did the company start going? Oh yeah, we didn't know about that. Yeah, you can't look at that

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       dude. And I mean I'm sure it started with like Penthouse, right? Like even when they have penthouse penthouse magazine, like when you had fucking like, you know for sure you couldn't bring your pen out of your fucking hustler to work.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       That's true. But the but looking at something online is so much easier than going to the store and getting a hustler. Like the access is universal, instantaneous. Everyone has the ability to just go and download it,

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       you know, if we're going to like ask questions that are impossible to answer. Like how many people right now do you think listening to the podcast or in their bullshit job jerking off to while they

Speaker 3:          00:20:47       listened? At least one dude. But yeah, for sure. That's what dudes do. Yeah, I mean because you can get away with it. They jerk off. Especially a guy with a bad job who could find a way to jerk off somewhere. Let me just five minutes in this bathroom with jerk off. Just think about the stupid fucking job. Dude. Come on. Like that's like sexual assault. I don't think off in an office. Not In the what if you scream, if everyone knows the going to go great. Hey, I'm going to go in there, I'm going to jerk off and when I come I scream that sexual assault. Oh for. Well that is. I fucking feel like suing you right now, man. Fucked up. You work with some guy and he's like 300 pounds and you're like 150 pounds and you're like, hey man, I need to figure out how to fix this computer. We're going to have to unplug everything for what? He goes. Okay, cool. I'm going to go in the bathroom. I don't want to jerk off. And when I come I scream.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       Dude, I don't know. I even have to add the scream too. And it's like, I mean I, I think Santa for

Speaker 3:          00:21:50       a dude, it's a terrible prospect.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       I think it's interesting too because when you consider like the act of shitting versus the act of jerking off is like far more repulsive. You're, you're expelling like foul smelling toxins from your body into the toilet. And if you say to your friend, Hey, I gotta go take a shit man, he, your friends probably going to be like, well, you didn't need to tell me that. Like, okay, I don't, but, but he, but your friend's not going to be like, Whoa Dude, what? And yet jerking off, really if you think about it, it's like you're giving yourself a hamish massage the end, just like a little spray of like cream coming out it horrific. It's like, it's like what? But in our culture, like, no, no, don't do it at the office. My God, John,

Speaker 3:          00:22:41       don't do it here. John. I'm just picture John just with an itchy trigger finger just ready to reach into his pants.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       No, no John. No. Did you do it again John? It's a gross relationship that the worker has now with the corporation and it's an unnatural relationship and it's a relationship that seems to have like dehumanized people to the point of being automatons that don't have a sex drive, that don't deserve to be able to explore their consciousness. And um, this is uh, a real problem. And

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       I'd already told me what he studied the Talmud and did it for like 12 hours a day when he was a young, young man. He told me that there was one passage where in one of the ancient texts where it was talking about battling a dragon and he said, he's like, this doesn't make sense because everything in here is supposed to be a story that actually

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       happened. Like what is this dragon? Or The dragon is a metaphor for masturbation. They tell them. So the dragon that takes away young boys. This is, it is. It is a metaphor for masturbation. Dan talked about this on the podcast. Yes, dude, it's, it's, you know, Ari knows about as much as anyone you're ever going to meet about Orthodox Jewish traditions and the religion and the, the tax. He really did study that shit every day. Twelve hours a day for year in Israel, right? Yeah. Yeah. So when he tells you about it and he got the, he got the actual translation of the metaphor from a guy who's a scholar.

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       Yeah, Dude. Yeah. That's a bad metaphor. That's like, I think like if I wanted for whatever reason to dissuade people from jerking off, I could come up with a way better like thing than a dragon to represent it, you know, there'd be some other thing like a, I don't know, man, like what's like, uh, what, what would be like the creature version of a rolled up ball of dried come that you've thrown next to your bed and someone walks into your bedroom and sees the rolled up ball of dried come clean x and it's just kinda like, that's gross. You didn't clean up your common clean x.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       It would be like one of them ghostbuster villains, right? Some sort of plasma thing that just Jesus all over, you know, they'd get ghostbusters. What do you think about the Antifa movement? Anti-Fat movement? FAP, fap. Oh No, no, jerking off. Yeah. No fat. Not anti-fat and diagnosed at different. Moving. Well, there's good and bad. The good thing is sex will be way more pleasurable. The bad is it'll be way more desirable so like to, to mitigate your sexual urges so you don't do stupid things and hanging out with stupid people, have sex with people you don't really like but you think are hot because you're horny and they're willing, which is a lot of people they get, they get wrapped up in these relationships with these guys and gals that they're not really in love with, but they like to fuck, you know, I'm, you know, it's like, what do you think about it?

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       Well, I think that there, you know, was something I always think back on is when you were sponsored by fleshlight in this is when we were doing the podcast from your house and you'd come to do your podcast and you'd walk away with a flashlight. So I ended up with like three or four flashlights. And like at first I just wanted like, you had different types and at first I just went for like, oh the one that looks like a pussy. Right? But then like, you know, it's like, oh, I got that one. But then you have like one that was like, I don't know, man, like some kind of like garlic oil alien. It was really nice. It was really fucking weird man. But anyway, you know, I fuck those things. And, and uh, and, and, and I, when I think back to it, it's like the first time I did it, it tricked my brain. The second time or third time I did it, it wasn't getting the same effect. Whereas when I have sex with a human, it's a completely different. It feels like it's a completely different series of chemicals that must be being released in my mind

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       uniting with someone you're bonding with someone, you certainly get the oxytocin from orgasming together, bonds people.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       So I've always thought generally like if I'm in a period in my life, arm jerk jerking awful lot, it's like usually like there's something imbalanced in there. Like I don't mean to apply like a sin to it at all. I'm just saying like personally it feels a little dissipative when you're doing it a lot. There is this, I don't know,

Speaker 1:          00:27:45       that's completely agree. That's the balance. But the balance is also like you don't want to just be horny all the time. No, because when you're hunting you make shitty decisions. So you like, yeah, you'll date someone just for sex.

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       Yeah. Well you need to like. I mean I think that there is something to be said for figuring out how to deal with like the, that kind of energy. So that's an, that's an energetic state. Like if suddenly you get being horny is an energetic state. Yeah. It's energy. Like if you're really horny and you sit and like watch the, the feeling itself, it's electrical. You could feel it moving around in your body. It like, it can almost make a twitchy a little bit. Like it's like a very potent energetic state. So theoretically instead of trying to get the question would be rather is there a way to release that energy that isn't through the tip of my Dick in the form of DNA? Is there a way for me to release that energy in other ways or is the only way the only valve on that to come? That's a question. What do you think?

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       I think there's this natural buildup happens. It makes people more easily aroused, it makes people more concentrating on sex and I think that that can put you out of balance too. You can be put out of balanced both by too much masturbation. You could definitely be put out of balance by too much desire for sex. Yeah, because you just horny show you just take care of it yourself and you'd be relieved and then you can think clearer. You know? I think the body needs a balance. Right. That's why I'm a big proponent of exercise. I'm a big proponent of meditation and mindfulness and just trying to. I mean it's. That's all those are toxic words right now. Meditation and mindfulness. Yeah. They've been thrown around by too many knuckleheads. Like there's something about it that it's like, oh, that's kind of a bull shitty word. You kind of know what I mean. You're like, oh, I'm just all about mindfulness. Like, oh, you're annoying. That's what you are. The annoying guy.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       I, I, I saw a book just yesterday and one of these boutique stores, someone had made a star cast at kids but called the grownups guide to mindfulness and whoever wrote that fucking book hates the word mindful. Definitely has an obnoxious friend who's into mindfulness because of the book is just like A. First of all, the guy doesn't seem to really understand what it is in the book. Like it's a, he seemed a little confused about the nature of it, but uh, and I remember looking at that and been like, oh, I guess people are getting annoyed with the word mindfulness now. Like the pendulum swinging that way. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Yeah. It's one of those words that people love to say it sounds good and it makes you seem like a spiritual person. So it gets when it gets moved around and used too much, like something happens to where it gets icky. Yeah. Because it's like it becomes popular and then people start using it and then you see like a bunch of phony guru type dudes at seminars using it. What's important here is mindfulness. Very important that, you know, there's like typically unique behaviors, you know what I mean? There's, there's, there's, especially when it comes to like people that are full of shit as like a typical uniqueness. Like there's just a thing that a lot of people adopt and it sounds like everyone else and it's just a way that people do it. And uh, I, I hope you understand like, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? You're adopting this weird, funky thing and you know, I think it's really important that we practice mindfulness. It falls into that. It falls into that even though it's an excellent practice. Well, it's very important,

Speaker 2:          00:31:29       but people, you know, it's called in. I, I just, I now have, I took on, for lack of a better word, I'm working with a actual, a teacher of the [inaudible] lineage of Buddhism, which is Chogyam. Trungpa is lineage of Buddhism and he's amazing and he's, and he's teaching me mindfulness meditation practice. This Guy David nichtern. But um, how does he deal with masturbation? What's cool about him is if you asked him, he'd, he would tell you. I'm sure there's no like, yeah, with, you know, that he wouldn't be like, wow, dad, you asked me that question, but I think that probably I don't, I can't answer for him. I think it would fall in line with what you're saying with balance, you know, which is that. It's really like a sort of the concept with it is the thing that is happening right now. Whatever it may be, you can just, you know, apply mindfulness to it. You could apply like a being in the moment and being with the thing that's happening right now. And so the, the thing he's teaching me, I love it so much because it isn't,

Speaker 6:          00:32:41       we will we or like out there crazy. It's literally this very simple way that you meditate with the way that you sit, which is you sit on a cushion, you put your hands on your knees in and you sit back and that he, the word they use in this Kagyu lineage. Ford is the warrior pose. And what that means is that it's a kind of confidence. It's the way, like people who are like confident sit. So you sit like that when you're meditating, you're legs are crossed and you sit in a chair if you want and you look straight ahead about eight feet, nine feet, and you watch your breath and when you go into your thoughts, which happens, of course you go, you think thinking and then you go back to your breath. That's it. You say thinking, you don't say it, you think it.

Speaker 6:          00:33:36       Thank. Thank you. Thinking just so [inaudible] what? What's all these. So like what, what you start realizing when you start this practice and full disclosure here, man, you know me Joe, I have problems with discipline and I have problems with like sticking to stuff over and over again and working with this guy has been incredible because it's actually getting me to, to do it right. Uh, but still I have like I did it today. I didn't do it yesterday. I'm just, I don't want to get out there and some nonsense that I'm like spending all day long meditating. But what you start seeing is when you're doing it is you realize like, oh, there's a cycle happening in my consciousness. In my mind, there's a cycle that's happening in my life, which is that I kind of blink into the moment following the breath and I blink out of the moment into the thought realm, right?

Speaker 6:          00:34:25       We're like little fireflies wee flicker into the moment. We're here now. We're here, we're not lost in our thoughts. We're not thinking about the next thing we're going to say. We're not thinking about the next thing we're going to do. We're just here in this moment. And then we're off. You know, often running, like thinking about the bills, forget about the girl thinking about the thing, thinking about that. And then that leads to another thought and another thought. Next thing you know, you've been thinking for three years straight, you know what I mean, or three minutes or five hours or whatever, and then you come back and that's the cycle. This is a cycle that happens. So mindfulness is starting to pay attention and, and, and, and to that cycle. But, and the breathing thing is kind of like a respiratory mnemonic device, which is that suddenly what's been happening to me now is I'll just be like walking down the street in the notice my breath. Oh Shit, I'm back. Oh, I'm here. I was totally over my head. Oh, I'm back. That was thinking, you know, that's all. It's very, very, very simple. But he's just teaching me the basic right now. It does. I

Speaker 5:          00:35:37       think it pretty interesting on my own thinking about my own life and observing other people's lives. I've come up with this thing that I bring up all the time. The momentum of your past like your, your, like so many people as they're going down the street. So many people as they're interacting with people, they're carrying the momentum of all the fucked up things that are going on. Bills that they have to pay and things that they forgot to do and a career they never chase. And a girl, they never called back. And the thing that they lied about, a thing they stole and the reason why they got fired from work. And maybe if I call my boss, I'll get my and all this craziness you're bringing with you into everything that is so hard to escape. It's so hard for people to escape the momentum of the past.

Speaker 5:          00:36:21       You know, people sort of get into this thing of defining themselves by failures, by past failures. And it never just learning from them go on that fucking loser. It's a real problem. It's a real problem with people to be able to learn from something and to just look at yourself. And it's painful to look at yourself. So everybody wants to pretend that they didn't do anything wrong right there. Everybody else is an asshole and that. Yeah. And so when you're doing what you're doing by doing that is you're stunting your own growth. You feel like you're protecting yourself because you're protecting your ego. You're like, you know, I didn't do anything wrong. Fuck him. He's the asshole. But you know, you could've avoided that. You know, you could've done better. Like everybody has moments like that in their life and the more you avoid those and don't take credit for the ones that you actually fucked up, the more you actually hurt yourself in this ironic thing because it seems like you're protecting yourself.

Speaker 5:          00:37:13       Know your. I'm exonerating myself from guilt as fuck it. It wasn't me. Oh, didn't do it, but you know you did so in your head, you're the guy who lies about making mistakes instead of you're the guy who mans up to your mistakes and realizes it was a mistake and then vows to do better. Yeah, man, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. You have to just have to be able to say you're wrong. You have to be able to say, I'm sorry. You have to be able to, and you got to be able to look at yourself like all the time. Now you've just, when you fuck up, because you can avoid some of those fuck ups. Just look at yourself critically along the way, but we all have to understand that we're. We are all in evolving process. Like I had this conversation with Dennis Mckenna. It's a crazy conversation because it's a ridiculous thing to say, but he was talking about a Donald Trump and I was saying, d, isn't it possible that he could grow and learn?

Speaker 5:          00:38:04       Like why do we give up on people? Why does a guy get to a certain age and we say, oh, he's 60. He set in his ways. He's 70. He'll never change. You'll never evolve. You don't ever say that about a 20 year old. You see some asshole who's a 20 year old. He said he just needs discipline and just needs. Love finds the right pr people in his life, right person to love. He'll be okay. He's gonna mature and eventually he's going to be a solid man, but you get to a certain age. We just give up on you just like you're still alive, but you've passed the cycle that I usually people to be ready to sort of interact as valuable creative, loving members of society. Pass that by. You're still thinking about yourself. Only deepen your sixties. This is stupid shit. This is shit you're supposed to do when you're 17.

Speaker 5:          00:38:48       By the time you're 70, you're supposed to be going, oh my God, I don't have much time left. Oh my God, what have I done while I'm here? What do. What is it important? What do I feel the best about? I feel the best about love and companionship and friendship and real warmth and interaction between people that you care about. This money thing, man, this is not. You can't keep chasing this. Can't keep chasing power. Can't keep chasing money. You're gonna. Reach a point where it's not going to matter because you're going to die, so you really want to be that guy from the bumper sticker. He who dies with the most toys wins because this is literally what you're working towards. You're working towards a joke.

Speaker 6:          00:39:24       Yeah. Well I will let. Can I. One thing I would add to that is that, so what you're saying here, and you're. You're right man, but the one thing I think I disagree with you on is that you're creating a situation where that's it. You die and that's it. The momentum smack the momentum goes into a black hole. It's gone. Like the momentum has been like as disintegrates vanishes, that momentum, right? But the way I've been taught is that actually that momentum keeps going. That momentum doesn't just stop because your body stops, right? So that momentum keeps going and in fact the, what's really beautiful is like. And it's good that you call it momentum. That's exactly what it is, what it feels like with me. It's a tendency, we have a tendency towards a certain thing. We have proclivities and tendencies and habituation and if you just kind of like, if you put you in me in a room and put a bunch of different objects on the floor, right, you're gonna go toward something and I'm going to go towards something else, right.

Speaker 6:          00:40:26       You know, if there's fucking vr goggles and a in a, in a God damn bad ass, like some kind of like bad ass compound bow manufactured it fucking Darpa. You know what I mean? And there's vr goggles manufactured by Darpa. I don't know, I'm going for the VR goggles. You're probably going to go for the cross or the boat, right? So we have proclivities. We have. That's the momentum, right? That is one way you can understand what Karma is, right? So that's the momentum. That's the moment. So that thing that you've got right now, when you begin to really look at it and think about it, you could ask yourself, when did this start? This momentum, right? When did this, these proclivities and tendencies and things that I'm being like sort of pushed towards. When did they start in? A lot of it is your parents taught you certain things, but

Speaker 5:          00:41:16       well, let's talk about a super common one that's horrible. Cigarettes you, you got cooked by that bug. Are He got hooked by that bug? Red Band still hooked. Joey Diaz kicked it. You know that's a. that's a really, really, really common one. Man. That's sorta defines people on that guy who I'm

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       going to walk into this store and even though I know these things cause cancer, I'm going to buy a pack. I'm gonna go outside and I can't wait to light it up. I'm just not even thinking about that right now, man. I'm trying to relax. And you get that thing in your mouth. There you go. And you take that drag and you feel that cancer causing chemical rush. Yup. And you're like, I'll take it, I'm alright today. No cancer. You take a big deep breath in and blow it out. And you look at the other fellow cancer dodgers and they're just looking at Jill and smoking together and everybody just really good at dodging cancer.

Speaker 6:          00:42:06       So, you know, another one way you could actually say it is like every time you do that you're planting a seed. So every time you smoke a cigarette, you could imagine that you have this field right in the field is your health. And in that field, anytime you like exercise or do something, you know, decide instead of eating the fucking ice cream you're going to eat. The seaweed chips are like, anytime you do that, you could just imagine obviously it's not the way it works exactly. But you could think I'm planting a seed in this field, right? So if I keep planning certain types of seeds and any type of field and I cultivate those seeds, they're going to grow into something, right? That's Karma. So what, when, when you know for a person, when the cancer comes, when the muscles come, when the failure comes, when the success comes, if you look at that moment, you realized this is actually the flowering of a thing that's been growing for a very long time inside of me or in the world or in time. So that's the idea people already have within them planted. All of these seeds haven't, haven't been expressed yet into time because they're still inside of them. Like the dude with the like imagine a guy with the guy who shot the guy because he had road rage. You know, that guy for years had a really bad anger disorder and he knew it. He would look. He would think at times in this very moment, I get really angry all the time. I don't know if this is normal,

Speaker 1:          00:43:38       right? A lot of those people were beaten when they were kids.

Speaker 6:          00:43:41       That's it, dude. Yeah. Yeah. Common Super Common Trauma. So yeah man, that's like cigarette smoking. Any kind of behavior that like is risky or over time produces some kind of negative result. It's just planting seeds. You know, and so the momentum you're experiencing right now is the sum total of all those fucking seeds that you planted and that were planted inside of you over the course of your life. That's what you're, you are, you're like a walking field of Karma at varying stages of growth, growing varying types of vegetation and some are good and some are bad, but it's like that's what you are right now. And what's beautiful about that is that means that you can start cultivating field.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       You know, you don't have to just like let it grow wild and, and pretend every time you smoke a cigarette or do some stupid shit, you're like an unconscious farmer.

Speaker 7:          00:44:46       Oh my God, what? I'm drinking and driving again, but I got to get home. Oh Shit. Oh my God. The Dui plant grew again in the field. I wonder why that thing keeps growing in my field. You keep fucking drinking and driving,

Speaker 2:          00:45:01       dude. The Dui play out. Yeah. Oh God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can cultivate it. That's what's beautiful about it. You know, you can cultivate the field. You don't have to let it just have fucking weird random weeds spring up though when a patch or to have some weeds because those are fun.

Speaker 3:          00:45:17       Imagine spending that tobacco money and spending that money thinking about all that cancer, spending all that money. God just buying a big castle. What all that cancer money. Castle cancer. Hey, the people want it. They want it. Yet in this country, you've got the freedom to buy whatever you want.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Well, yeah, right. I mean it's a person's choice, but. But to get back to what you were just saying, the ethics of the fucking day. How about this? How many people who run big tobacco own stock in companies that make chemotherapy drugs? There is a big question like how many of those people in their portfolio that they barely know about, they're like, well, you know, like a really big investment these days is a k gene therapy for cancer. Really

Speaker 7:          00:46:06       cancer out of hand these days. Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:46:08       Interesting. I wonder what could be going wrong. The problem with cigarettes is that they're addictive. Will just kill you. Yeah, but that they're addictive. Like I, I've smoked a cigarette before and it gives you a head rush. Wasn't like a nice little weird rush. It's. And also the, the other problem is nicotine is a madison and, and it has like some health benefits if used in the right way. And also it's a nootropic so yeah, it's not, it's not just like it gives you a rush. It's like it's it, it's a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       Steven King said that was one of the most difficult things when he quit smoking was not having one way. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:46:48       That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you, because that's the nature of addiction. It's like Kudzu dies, did trees. It wraps around your favorite thing in life and tricks you ended Kudzu. Kudzu is a plant that was introduced from Japan and I think from Japan into the south and it's just a growing. We vine that when it wraps around trees and it covers them up completely so the trees can't get any sun and the trees just die. Yeah. It wasn't native to the United States, so sometimes, I don't know, maybe they took care of Gutsy, but when I was a kid you would drive by these beautiful forests that were where the trees were just covered in. Fucking cuts it. Yeah. Like,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       yeah, that's crazy. It's like they got eaten other plant. That's right, man. And those trees are dying. They can't get the sun. The. Oh my God. It's insane. And that's a great metaphor for addiction or for [inaudible] is a perfect metaphor. Yeah. My God. That's insane. How did I not know about this? It's definitely seems like something you'd know about. Look, it looks like they're alive. It looks like people do. There's just too much to know. There's too much cool shit. Shit out there. Too much. Look at that. Felt. Go to the one above that. Above that. Above that one, right above that. Yeah. That one. Look at that. Yeah, the green. That is. That's insane. Dude. That does something weird. Your brain beautiful. It's like, it makes you feel like you're like you're on a drug. Like if you were standing there and it was that green and that like vibrant, you'd be like, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          00:48:21       Yup. Yeah, you would. It would feel so good when you ever see anything that looks like that. I say, let those fuckers take over. Let do, take over trees. Can't fight off the Kudzu. They don't deserve to live. You have to fucking evolve. These cuts were cooler. They're offering your cooler look, but he's like, hey, you want to look at your boring ass fucking gray bar? Bullshit leaves on the ground or how about we just take over everything? What the fuck are we cover? The floor carpet? Yeah, we covered the floor and the hillsides and all the trees. Everything Green is. Fuck. Okay. Well what kind of green like flow green man, like vibrant flow green will you. If you smoke weed there, you're going to trip balls. Yeah. Look at that. What is that? A covered it. Statue is at a golf statue. That's just this telephone pole light pole that it seems like so good.

Speaker 4:          00:49:10       Have sculpted that a little bit maybe. Or maybe it's just really covering a light pole. Yeah, yeah man, there you go. So that, that that's like a really funny thing that like, like alcoholics, they'll get their alcoholism wound up and their social life or like their creativity, their creative cycle, so they will think like, fuck man, without the booze, I don't think I'm going to be able to write as well or you know, whatever it is. It mostly, it's just people who have this a really smart way to avoid getting healthier or, or the learning curve associated with getting healthier and it's a really intelligent trick to play on yourself, which is, do imagine that, you know, whatever it may be that's currently out of balance in your life. If you remove that, you're not going to be able to be as good as person. You know? There's a lot of alcoholics out there who are performers who think, oh, if I don't drink, I got to have a beer on stage man or early. Where it gets hard core is when it's like actually fucking wrapped up in the art publicly. Like, I don't know if you're aware of this rapper who died named Lil peep, you know, about little peep I heard about him.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Yeah. And one of his videos that just shows like the, the floor of his car, the f just pill bottles scattered everywhere. Right. So like part of the identity, he, he was projecting into the world involved like the Romanticization of addiction to pharmaceutical medications. Right. And so that's where it gets real. Or like big comics when all their jokes are about being fat and if they. So they, they don't only have to like, worry about like, you know, being fat, they have to worry about if I got healthy, I don't know if my jokes are gonna work anymore. So you know what I mean? It's like that's, that's how insidious it can get, you know? Yeah. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Good one. That one does creep in. I actually heard Kevin James, I heard someone say that to him, you lose weight, you're losing roles.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       God. Someone just told me, it's like you either need to lose 15 pounds or gain 15 pounds if you want to get in the movie. I don't remember he said that, but it's like, yeah, it's like you know, you, you, you, you're, you become this character or something like that in the next thing you know, you're fucking addiction is just riding you around like a horse whispering in your ear without me will know where to go and now you're fucked. You're fucked. Yeah. I'm your comfort blanket. Yeah. Yeah. Like you're all alone. When you're drinking alone in your hotel room. Woo. Dark. That's dark. But then when you get into it too, when you're not just drinking alone, but you're like telling stories to yourself, celebrating it. You're pretending. Anytime you find yourself pretending you're fucking hunter. S Thompson, baby, get a cigarette holder unless you're writing like him.

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       You ain't hunter s Thompson. All right. You're having fun. No doubt. But I know in my life like the Times where I've been like, it's of like a hunter, s Thompson. It's like, dude, you need to go to bed. Yeah. Like stop. You're like you, you, you, you're, you're tricking yourself. Now you know, that's. I'll just don't trick yourself. By the way, if you want to be a self destructive alcoholic, drug addict, whatever it is, be that thing, but don't fool yourself into thinking that's not what you're doing. It's romantic. Yeah. Yeah. Don't like as your plummeting towards splattering all over the fucking ground. Pretend that you're flying towards the earth. Well, maybe you could. Maybe that's actually a cool way to tie. That's a good way to think

Speaker 1:          00:53:00       right before impact. Maybe that's the water tower. God did.

Speaker 2:          00:53:03       Yeah. Dude. Maybe so

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       in who knows what you see when you do eight days of Iowasca who know what you see? That seems like eight days of any potent psychedelic. I've never done that. I've never done more than one day in a row. I've done one day in a row, take a break, maybe a little pot the next day, and then I don't do anything for like months.

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       That's how I've always done it. I've never done like a big session followed by big session. Yeah. Yeah. I know. We can only speculate. I don't know exactly what that would be like. I mean, I can imagine. I couldn't imagine. Dude, I had this crazy idea, crazy idea. Now this is a lens, I don't know if it's true or not, but obviously it's probably not true, but I got this crazy idea that like, and again, like this with you, I could just say this and I don't have to preface it, but since people isn't your podcasts, I have to preface it by saying I do not believe this. I'm not going insane, but this is a fun thing to think about. You know, it's okay to imagine shit in your mind. It's okay. Like you can imagine stuff. But. So I was thinking like inspiration, right?

Speaker 6:          00:54:17       Specifically I was thinking like Jr Tolkien when you read Lord of the Rings, it's like that guy went over there that writing is so beautiful and so perfect. And so like interdimensional extra dimension old. It's fucking old book and it's beautiful. His writing. Yeah. I was thinking, Oh that guy token that inspiration is outflow from the DMT realm into this dimension through the, um, through the processor of his meat computer. And this is like a kind of drip coming out of a dam. The dam is something that's been constructed by power structures who want to keep that realm out of here. Right? And so over there you get usually a kind of message, right? And the message is usually something along the lines of, we need to love each other. We can love each other here. There's something more important than money, uh, to really be very reductive about it, but some version of that story that usually involves some kind of desire to no longer harm people or to reduce suffering or to be a better person or however you want to put it.

Speaker 6:          00:55:35       Right? So there's a dam that's been built and the dam is built by the people who scan your pis for Lsd. It's people who have created an intentional legal obstruction between one realm and the other, which is the realm mechanical hyperspace in the realm that we're currently existing in, which is where there's a lot of scientific materialism where people only believe that there is only matter here. There's only matter. That's it. There's nothing else. No spirit, no soul, right gatekeepers. The gatekeepers I, I've been, I used to think of them as gatekeepers. Now I think of them as dam builders, builders, and what happens is from time to time, a big crack in the dam opens up, right? That's when someone like fucking Martin Luther King appears in his standing in front of so many people telling them. I think that we're all the same, is what I think.

Speaker 6:          00:56:41       I think we're all the same and he's doing it in this very charismatic, beautiful way, right? That's a big fucking crack in the dam because over on this side of things, they don't want us to be all the same. They want us to be separated by a lot of different fucking things. They don't want us to be all the same over here. So the cracks in the dam opened up and the big cracks, Bam. The little cracks. They're like the good art, the good poetry, the great movies, the good inspiration, and now what's happening because of the fucking Internet is, Oh, these fucking cracks in the dam or opening up. They can't seal them up anymore. It's like you can't see all the fucking damn anymore in the singularity that Mckenna was talking about the apocalypse, which actually means lifting of the veil. What did that is, is when the dam reaches a point where the structural integrity has been permanently compromised in the DMT realm, flows into this dimension in the form of some kind of technology that either unifies all of us are like rips a hole literally into whatever that membrane is that separates us from the infinite, and that is what for whatever reason, over in this dimension, people have been trying to stop so

Speaker 4:          00:58:02       because it impedes progress in terms of like making money. We're building businesses. You can't be building businesses if people were doing lsd on their brakes. I don't think that's true. I think you could run a wonderful business. No, no, no. They're going to come back and they're not going to be concerned with productivity. Well, they're not going to be. No, no, no. If we get a group of people together and start building something amazing, not for money. Oh No. I'm just being facetious. Certainly can be done. I'm, I'm, I'm arguing with the devil's advocate. What? Okay. Let me play the devil. Okay, nice to meet you. Finally, can I have my soul back? No. Dammit. This whole thing of you exploring hyper dimensional space and all that stuff, all that does is make you stupider and you show up at work and you, you're less disciplined and you're not interested in getting the job done. Okay. This company is built on teamwork. Okay? And it's built on everyone pulling their weight. Now, if you're off fucking off in hyperspace from Friday night to Sunday morning and you barely get six hours sleep over the weekend and you show up Monday, I'm going to test your pis. Okay? Yeah, and if I find silicide been in there or anything else fucking squirrely. Do you mind if I show you David Nuts? Professor David Nutt, study on the landsat about the dangers of the variety of drugs I, I'd like I'm talking to the devil here. Do

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       you mind if I show you this? Because if you notice sir, on this chart, they again published in the landsat is peer reviewed. This is a very important study, Professor David Knight, of course, has since been disbarred and somewhere and accrued some kind of horrible punishment for being an advocate for psychedelics. But anyway, sir, forgive me, but if you'll, you'll notice on this chart, psilocybin is considered the least harmful of mind. All three candidates

Speaker 5:          00:59:51       interested in harmful. Sir. I'm interested in productivity. I want this place to run fast. We're in competition and we're losing jobs overseas. Do you know they're going to start to make Harley motherfucking Davidson motorcycles in Thailand? Yes sir. Yeah. What kind of Shit is that? I know it's a goddamn American bike and they're making it over in fucking Asia. Why? Because the people in the factory over here didn't kick ass. Okay. They're over in the fucking park taking their magic mushrooms and trip and balls when they should be thinking about how they keep this company active. This company feeds and houses 150 families. You understand that? Yes. Or how it's 100. Are you happy now? You still want to fucking raise serve before I forget, I picked up your prescription for oxycodone, Oxycontin fucker. I'll take it on their oxygen. Bullshit.

Speaker 6:          01:00:41       Yeah. Your extra postage. Yeah. You're on adderall. You're methamphetamine. Yeah. One hundred percent. So yeah. Right. So. So D'evelyn, devil lab. So. Right. So the answer to it is that I'm talking to you. Oh, well here's the problem sir. You don't realize this, but you're kind of a low level priest in a, in a religion that is spread far and wide and in this religion it's not really the, the, the money that you're interested in as much as it is the power because you have become a servant of a being called the demiurge, which is essentially attempting to create as sort of authoritarian hierarchy in this particular dimension that's been separated from another place known as the galactic. You can call it whatever the fuck you want, but it's the aliens. It's a galactic civilization that is about to pour into this civilization and so it really doesn't matter what you do because within the next 20 or 30 years through technology and through the unification of people because of the fact that technology, you're gonna either come to our site or go completely insane.

Speaker 5:          01:01:53       Okay. The counter to that of course is the only way you're gonna get there. You fucking lazy hippies because if we make you go to work and we get shit done and you buy things and you keep this fucking country's economy healthy that way. The technology innovators, that way we make the hyperspace gateway. You Lazy fucking hippies tripping balls on your lawn furniture. You're not creating shit. Okay. You show up for work on time. You get the job done.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Eventually we'll get our portal.

Speaker 6:          01:02:21       Well, it sounds okay. Can I address something you just said Satan? Yes. On time. Now this is a very funny term. Thank God I'm reading David grave the. Here's a great term on time. Right? So like boss, the. The problem is that like the thing you're doing with time are being on time. That's a relatively new imposition into society and it started with clock towers. During the industrial revolution, they'd put clock towers up so the people always knew what time it was, so they wouldn't be late for going to work in a. In a factory. You see, there was a time when people weren't like obsessed with their fucking watch because the idea that you could sell time, here's what it is, sir. You think you and I have entered into a contract where for some ridiculous reason I've agreed to sell you eight hours of time.

Speaker 6:          01:03:14       My time per day. It's essentially a form of slavery. It's a kind of like slavery, except I get to go free for a certain amount of hours per week into servitude. Yeah, we can call it that with like less of the power. I can leave anytime I want indentured servants. I don't think they could because they were kind of trapped until they paid a certain. Certain jobs are contract will, you could quit most jobs. I mean that's kind of the rationalization that people use is they're like, you can leave anytime you want bud in anytime you want.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       The hard jobs are those jobs where people work for salary and their time is just whatever the project takes. Like. Do you ever talk to so many worse on video games? Right now I've. I've met very few people. I mean, I met a few, but it's like they don't work in the big companies do the hours that they put in before a video game is released is insane. Right? A lot of them just sleep in the offices to work in 16 hours a day. Just coding. They're all living on top of each other. A brutal, brutal,

Speaker 6:          01:04:17       brutal. Yeah. Brutal. And, and

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       this is sounding job. You're asking for someone's whole life. That's right. You're asking for the whole life. You occasionally can get away from me and go camping. You occasionally get away from me. Have a picnic with your family. You wish. Usually you can get away, but for many, many months I want you all the time. I just want you there all the time. And in exchange I'll give you some money. So like

Speaker 6:          01:04:41       conceptually I don't think that this is like a terrible situation as long as the person is really into what they're doing. Right? And then what we have is just kind of like a, um, I guess you could say what a capitalist commune or I don't know what you'd call it. It's like a group of people commuting together as seeking to like extract money from the universe, but also like, you know what comes to mind? Sorry, anyone from blizzard who's listening you like doesn't like your job there, but I got to. I went to on this tour of blizzard and they fucking every company that makes video games, they make the

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       best video games outside of like the only game I notch up with it right now I'm in the god of war, so fucking good. But it looks pretty bad ass. It is amazing. It is amazing dude. It's the first triple a game I've liked in so long. What's a aaa? Is it? It's called AAA. Aaa. It's a really expensive game to make. It's like, it's like a hardcore big time. Pull up a video. God, it's so graphics are pretty fucking incredible, dude. Dude. It's beautiful. Don't get me. Get fucked. That alien damn bullshit. God award is like. It's so good man. And like I'm stuck in it. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       Put on the HTC Vive today. The new one that we. You didn't get into a game yet. There's some games in it where you're just like, Whoa, I see where this is going and I saw that from yours from, but yours was when I was over at your place. What was that? Two or three years ago, two years ago. Look how good the good that is. He can see like the dirt on his hands. It's like you're watching an episode of Viking Dude. It's really good and it's. And it's like bitch ass fucking thing freezing up again. Here it goes. So this is actual gameplay. See Why is this fucking game play? Dude? That's gameplay. That's gameplay. That's amazing. Yeah, it's incredible. It's amazing. She's so hot. Very hot. I think you could hang out with the trick was like cut people's heads off a sorts. Yes,

Speaker 2:          01:06:43       absolutely. Look at her, look at him rather her fucking bad dude. What's great about this game is not just like the graphics which are incredible or the fight mechanics, which are also incredible, but the fucking story is really good and the acting is really good and like the relationships between characters are really intense. This game will make you like tear up man. Like it's like fucking, we should see what he just did. Chop that dude and half with an ax. Holy Fuck Up. Is this got smashed by a smashed. He gets smashed a lot, but he's created us. The God of war. He doesn't give a fuck. Does not give a fuck man. That's incredible. Wouldn't even show much more of this. It's spoilers. I don't want anybody to see any of the characters or to know what's happening because it's that good. Like it's such a good game.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       Most Games, the way I've played video games is I try to rush through it for some reason, which is really dumb to be like, oh, I got to win this thing, this one you want to hang out, look around, see the landscape. And like you get really into it. It's a glorious game. But you know that to get back to where you're talking about it. Blizzard, uh, one, one of the people working there told me, we like building world of warcraft because we liked playing world of warcraft. We've created a dimension we want to be inside of like we enjoy it, they love it. And, and that's why the game is so good because it's being made by people who enjoy playing the game. So I don't know how many hours they work at blizzard. I imagine it's, it can be pretty brutal schedule, but in anything you do, even things you love I know become grueling, but I think that example of a company versus a company where you're like either doing something that you don't even need to be there to do or no comparison, no comparison.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       I mean it might be massive hours a day, but I bet you're having a great time a lot of the time and the actual results and saying, you know, I was friends with a lot of those guys from id software back in the quick two days and played quake three. I got to play quake three before it ever came up with you. We are trying. That's Dallas Clif. No, Clif Eeb. He's soft software as doom and quake. Cliff Eby is unreal.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       Oh No, I was with you and cliff. He began to her. I didn't see the quake two as well.

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       Both amazing. But we. Yeah, we got to see unreal tournament when they were putting that together and they were putting together this new engine that will not being used in a bunch of different games afterwards, but it was fucking crazy. We get to see the graphics like as they're designing things and same thing with the quakes studios, but those guys all were crazy gamer so they would get land parties and sync all we played at the ID software. We got to play death matches between everybody in the studio. It was awesome to play quake with the guys who made quake. Fucking cool, funny shit. I've fucking cool man. And you know, I mean what they did was if you've never played one of those games before, the three dimensional games, when you're running down, you hear things over here behind you and you like you, you know, you could turn around and sneak around corners and people are chasing around the map and sometimes you could walk and it doesn't make any noise or you could run and you can hear the footsteps. Fucking cool as fuck. It's the crazy. This is so adrenaline packed when you're playing this game. So these guys, I'm so terrified. We're putting a land in here in the next couple of weeks. Now you are. Oh, we're going to. You and I were going to have some fun.

Speaker 2:          01:10:25       Well, no, we're not because you're going to be me at fucking quake. I suck at shooter's. Dude. Played in forever please and played for ever. I'll probably be terrible for the first 16 hours if I like. Had a shrink ray and shrunk you like into like an eight year old. You would still beat me at shooters. I suck at fucking shooters, man. I was your thing. What do you like? You liked those a roleplay say at dude, because you're going to make fun of me. I won't do it on. I like hearthstone. Man. Was that. I don't even know what it is. Fucking fell for it. He didn't fall for it. I'm being sincere. I don't know what it is in mine. Fantasy card game. It's like a furry thing like furries. I love comedians seminar because it's like I knew you were going to insult me. I just didn't know

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       how and like it's way the way you did. It was way worse than I expected. Thank you. Pretend to be a Fox, right? Fox Kin. Are you? Other than you, other kids get a kick out of it. Do you ever do it in your footie pajamas? Like a little bunny rabbit tail on either the woods and I'm a rabid dog. Fuck man. I've got to be clever to get away from the joint. Say, let me tell you something. It's a wonderful fucking game with and it's deep and it's got a lot of strategy and I and I and I love playing it, man. I really do. I'm not good at anymore. I went through a period of being good. I haven't played it in awhile because I've been playing God of war, but Oh, look at this. Is this it? Yeah. This looks like death. What is happening? What is happening here? Let's see your cards. Yeah, they're cards. You basically like the. I'm not going to explain the rules. A hearthstone on your show dude, but those don't. Great Games is killing me. It's a great. It's a great, very fun, very enjoyable game, good game for nine year old girls. That's what it looks like. Get it for my kid and I'm just thinking like, ah, to do is say star craft or I could ally, but I knew I had to tell you the truth, but I knew you were addicted that

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       you got a real problem with that for while you and I met each other in our video game. Addictive tendency.

Speaker 4:          01:12:41       We're both like, yeah, gotTa be careful.

Speaker 6:          01:12:45       But Dude, you know this. This is something I was thinking I wanted to bring up during the podcast. Man. It's like when we first started hanging out and you told me something I've never gotten in. It's from the book of five rings by Mia Motto Musashi and you mentioned something from that book which is that learn one thing and you will know how to do a lot of other stuff. Right? So he would, uh, apparently he would, um, he was a Samurai and so he recommended for Samurai not just to learn the sword, but to learn poetry, learn how to paint, learn how to do this step. Because in the metta process of learning, you learn, you like you, there's something in there that like fits onto all forms of learning. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:13:40       Well, you don't want to be too hard, but you don't want to be too soft. You want to be a balance right in, in a balance, you must. You have to be artistic and destructive. You have to be loving and hating. You know, he, he played games with his opponents like he didn't just fight. No, billy, he was an asshole. He would show up hours late for duals and make the guy wait. Oh, say knew the guy would be freaking out. He would show up sometimes with wooden swords instead of metal swords to fuck with their heads. One time he whittled a sword out of an or of the boat that he, he rode over to the beach where you're supposed to have the sword fight. Showed up hours late. Fuck Dude. Up with an or. Yeah, he would, he would play games with people. I knew that there was psychological warfare in him showing up late. Right. You know?

Speaker 6:          01:14:26       Right. Yeah. And do you remember the first sentence of the book?

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       I do not. I remember the quote that you just were talking about because I say it all the time. It's like the reason why I have this tattoo on my arm. This is Musashi, you know, it's, once you understand the way broadly or once you know the way broadly, you will see it in all things that. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:14:44       So, so which is also a as above. So below it's another way of saying that it's like, it's. So it's the concept that uh, if I practice some things. Yeah. For example, like right now, like I'm learning how to do modular synthesis. Like at modular sense, they're bad ass. It's like for making music, right? I'm 44. I'm not like thinking to myself like, man, one day I'm going to be fucking based factor. I'm not going to get, you know what I mean? I don't, I don't, I don't leave. I'll perform live with them ever. But I'm, I, I got sucked into it and now I'm taking it seriously. So I'm learning how to do it for real. Like, and then that pulls you into like music theory, right? So now you start looking at, well what is this song and why does this song is a song set up like it is and what her notes and what's a tone, right?

Speaker 6:          01:15:39       What's an Oscillator, what are these things? And then like from that you get pulled into like pythagoras and then suddenly you're like reading like shit by Pythagoras who like had another great quote which is do not take the roads traveled by the public is pretty awesome, which means isn't that bad ass? But um, but anyway, the point is like, because I've been studying like the modular synthesizer now when I sit down and play guitar, like I'm a little better at it. But then where it gets fucking weird is when I sit down and play like God a war. I'm a little better at that too. And then like when I'm thinking about cutting tomatoes, for example, something really basic and the pressure I'm exerting to cut the tomato versus the sharpness of the knife. I think about music and I think about, Whoa, in a weird way, my knife is like a, this is, you won't know what this is.

Speaker 6:          01:16:36       Maybe like my knife is like a CV gate, which is like if you have a tone, like a gate might be an on and off, like a switch that makes the tango will, will, will, will, will blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Right. So suddenly the shit you're learning from like. And by the way, synth nerds out there. I don't know what I just fucking said. I fucked it up. I'm sorry I'm learning but, but, but the, the, what I'm saying is it's like what he was saying, what he was teaching is so powerful, which is like what? You don't just get good at one thing it into other shit and your wife to sure. That is an incredible thing for me to realize man. It's been pretty intense because like, you know, when you like what you were saying, you know, for if you're a 20 year old, you know, people expect you to be learning something, this or that. But when you're in your forties, you know, you can trick yourself into thinking like, I don't need to learn how to do anything anymore. And then you're basically like turning down all the lights in your life because when you start working on something,

Speaker 5:          01:17:43       even this is what I was going to ask you, and maybe even video games. Oh, for sure. Video Games, do we dismiss them because they were thought of as frivolous exercises and we embrace chess and go and all that. And even poker because we know that it's an intellectual pursuit or real poker players are all super fucking smart guys. The guys that were really good at it. Um, I think that we do that with video games because at one point in time they were just pong and then they were mario brothers and they were silliness and fun. You get the mushroom and have a good time and PAC man and all that shed. But now when you see God at war, you're like, okay, well clearly your brain is firing on all cylinders. When you're doing that. You're swinging that acts and switch into this sphere and doing this. And jumping there and chopping this student half and getting away from the guy with the fucking flying logs thrown at you. That's your brain. Your brain's firing left and right. The idea that this is totally useless seems stupid.

Speaker 6:          01:18:38       Yeah. Yeah. So I think that that potentially through anything, the problem with video games is you can play them and actually not get better at them because you just like are slashing and pressing buttons and Shit. Like you have to folk you can focus. But I think when focus, when your attention and focus gets put on improving anything, like I theoretically, I imagine if you just started working on drawing a circle or drawing a perfect circle and just spent day after day working on that pursuit sounds insane. Like you'd look crazy, dear friends for potentially other shit in your life. You'd start improving at to your mind gets a little sharper maybe. Maybe it's just some kind of neuro

Speaker 5:          01:19:25       or something. I Dunno, it's exercise. It's an exercise for your mind for sure. Your brain is very, very active when you're playing a video game. You know, I, I know what I would play, quake, my hands would get so sweaty that I would put antiperspirant on my hands. I would spray antiperspirant all over my hands and then I would blow on them to keep them from getting so sweaty because my fingers would barely. They would slip around over the keyboard. I leave puddles and keys. My mouse would get soaking wet. My it wouldn't be dripping over the mouse pad and the ball would get stuck. Then eventually became a laser beam, laser tracking first suck. Then it got way better for us was like you wanted that ball. He wanted to feel that the ball, the mouse because you got that tactile sensation, but then it got to a point where these laser ones were so much more accurate and they never fuck up. They just became better. That shit has always been like really odd to me. When you look at a gaming mouse and it says how precise it is under the DPIS DPI. I remember razer mouse had one that was 2000 DPI, the Mamba and it was crazy. You play with the thing and be like, Jesus Christ, it was so fast. It was an odd shape like it was a duck foot. Do you remember that?

Speaker 3:          01:20:36       Yeah. Stay away to the ones. Now you. There's a button on it. You can switch mid game depending on what you're doing or what you need. You can set up your DPI from uptake. W 8,000, 10,000, 2000 down to 200. 100. Wonder why we made it slower. Slower. There's some games like you, you don't need to be moving that much. Might be a sniper, so you need very small adjustments and you can make big moves with your hands and have still a small adjustment. Yeah. Some guys, when the adrenaline would kick in, they would like a slow mouse speed and a big mouse pad and they moved

Speaker 5:          01:21:06       pat around like that and they felt more precise that way than they were with a small pat and a high speed because some guys used to like do little wrist flicks were like super high speed and you would try their mouse. He'd be like, hey man, can I try your setback? Because everybody set was different and I would try their setup of like, Jesus, how do you even concentrate? This is crazy. It's you're moving so fast. They would have their speeches and they would. Our acceleration mouse accelerations. Yeah. So if you move faster, it actually goes faster. Almost like you're throwing a whip. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:21:35       I know dude. You need that in starcraft. Like you're doing that too. Oh absolutely. Yeah. That's a very important. Getting your mouse set at the right speed and then you get used to that speed. So if your mouse is fucked up, you're definitely gonna like you're gonna make bad decisions. But I never got like I got. Okay. It star craft. I think I got up to like, oh no, maybe silver league or something like that. What does that mean? So if you were interested, it's not a big deal. Would you have a purple belt belt after white belt? Blue. What's the one after that? Purple. It's probably blue blue belt because bronze league is where I stayed for ever. That's the white belt stage. Yeah, mercilessly getting my fucking ass handed to me in bronze league. And then like finally I figured it out a little bit and for I popped into the silver league and then you want to go back to the fucking bronze league because once you get to the silver lake, you can't do a fucking early game painting rush. You can't like, can't do that. Fuck no, you can't do any of that shit. And when you try it, when you try it, they're gonna like they're gonna make fun. You know they're going to tie it to you like no. But they're also going to be like, what? Like, what are you doing? You fucking newb fuck you. Why are you doing that? Shit, I wanted a real game. You're going to do something like early game failing. Rushed against my.

Speaker 3:          01:22:55       You don't want people to get super mad when they're fucking connection with timeout. And they would be stuck in the game and you'd fuck them up. Stuck. Frozen. Oh yeah. Just light them up. You know like

Speaker 5:          01:23:05       sometimes you do you use like your smallest gun and just slowly pick away their house. Purell Po, Po, po. You Punch him. When we were in the old quake games, you could punch dudes.

Speaker 6:          01:23:16       Yeah, yeah. There was some video that popped up at that new game fortnight. Everybody's playing and it's like it was on Undergrad. I was like the worst fortnight player ever because it's someone who clearly got up to go get chips or maybe they and, and the dude's like shooting at them and can't hit like a still person. Yeah, man games are bad ass these days. Man. I really love him, but I do like think to myself, I still am probably just because I'm like an older person. I do think there's like a hierarchy of like what's good to do and I think it's bad for me. It's bad. I like learning music right now. I like sitting down picking some basic thing about music, figuring out one little thing about a module, one of my sense and what it does and understanding it and then like unfolding that into something bigger and that can lead to hours of, of it. Whereas like if I sit down and play God of war, you know that's also going to lead to ours. But at the end of it I'm going to know more about a story, whereas the other one I'm going to know a little bit more about math and like how sound works in general, which is a fascinating thing altogether. You know? So I don't know. What do you think? Is there a hierarchy of shit to do? Like

Speaker 5:          01:24:34       no, I don't think there is. I think there's a hierarchy and elevated passion levels. So like what are you passionate about? Say if you were doing something and you know, you were very apathetic about it, but then there was this other thing that you did that once you started, like for some people of the World Cup was on today, I went to get a cup of coffee and they have the World Cup on and these guys are gathering around watching the World Cup. To me it's just dudes running around. I don't know what's going on. I don't know. It's fine. It's great, it's good. But for them it was clearly. And for the world, for all the people watching in the stands is an elevated level of passion for that. Now, if that was your thing, I would say maybe you can be a commentator and maybe you can be a player or maybe it could be someone who produces one of those soccer shows or something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:25:16       There's just plenty of gigs for that, but if that's your thing and instead you get into shoe sales, like Al Bundy, you know, after awhile that shit chips away. Just not what I like. What I like is I want to play soccer, I want to watch soccer, I want to talk about soccer, I want to commentate on soccer. Yeah, you got to find the thing and that yellow gold, not everybody can commentate on soccer. Dad is true, but it's also a loser mentality like someone can. Not everybody can, but how many people try? That's the other thing. Like people say, not everybody can be successful. Comedian. You're right. How many people try though, right? Not that many people try. A more people could do it then, then try. I think there's a bunch of people out there that could. I always tell you about. I've told you about this guy,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       my friend Dave Dolan, who is my boss, he's a private investigator. When I was a kid, I got a gig driving him around. He needed an assistant. Really? He got a Dui and they took his license away and needed a driver. He was the funniest guy I've ever met. He's right up there with Joe. He was so funny, man. And you know, not no aspirations for comedy at all. And his cousin was Billy Downs who was one of the owners of the comedy connection in Boston. So his, his cousin was a former comedian who owned the comedy club and just randomly became friends with them from an ad on like one of those newspaper ads for the job seeking private investigators assistant. I'm like, that sounds like a cool job. So. But this guy easily could have been a comic, like a hundred percent. Could have been. Sure. He's a.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       He was a funny fucking dude and he was always the guy that has a bunch of people were saying around. He would say something like, totally ridiculous looking in the eye and say it and everybody would be laughing. It was just natural. He was just a naturally funny guy. Just didn't do it. Did he liked being a private investigator? Loved it. Loved it. Loved busting people. Cheaters. Mostly people who were cheating on their insurance. That was mostly. It was. There was a few one. He got one guy who kept asking him to take pictures of his girlfriend getting fucked by this giant bodybuilder. Dude after wise like, hey dude, enough with this kinky shit. I'm not giving you any more fucking pictures through attitude. He's like, get the fuck Outta here with this. He goes like, what else do you want, bro? I got the pictures that are going to get more pictures.

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       You fucking idiot. That's so funny. That's so funny that. Why didn't the guy just hire a photographer? Right. Well the guy was. He was just like really wealthy but diminutive. Very non masculine man. And he had this bombshell girl that he had figured out a way to get a part of. Yeah, but she was just getting drilled on the side. Did she know he was getting pictures taken? I don't think she did. No, I don't think she's. Sounds like, to me it sounds like a fetish game where he's like, oh, seems like a. But I don't think it was. I think it was just a weak guy. Didn't know what to do because they would be on the beach. He get pictures of him on the beach making out and stuff like he got. He got enough pictures. A lot of these guys. I mean I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:28:25       Yeah, I don't know man. I just. That to me sounds a little bit like, well that's what he thought a little bit. He thought the guy was a little bit of a freak, but at the end of the day he was like, look, come on. You know, it was fucking heavy Boston accent, Bro. I got you. You fucking pictures did make a move. Right? Not taking any more. Clf Sucks. That's a shit job. I wouldn't want to do that. He loved busting people. That's not his thing. He didn't really like. That was rare. Most of the time he worked for insurance companies, most of the time it's like say if you were married and you were a woman and you had a different maiden name, you would get injured on the job and then you would start using your maiden name and take a job on the side while you're getting workman's compensation.

Speaker 1:          01:29:03       So people would get double paid. Yeah, and they would have to leave their jobs, like people would leave their job super early in the morning so we would camp out in front of people's houses where we would get there at 4:00 in the morning when everybody's asleep. We'd sit in the car across the street and we'd wait sometimes earlier and we'd wait and we'd wait and we wait 5:30 roll around and then you'd see some light go on and you're like, he's up, he's up, he's up here. He goes, here he goes, this motherfucker's going to work and this is the guy that's supposed to be laid up in bed. And we catch them like working as a roofer carrying shingles up the ladder when they're getting disable a disability insurance. Yeah. So that was a really common thing. Most of it was disability insurance

Speaker 6:          01:29:40       man. What a fucked up state of life to get into. Or you're doing insurance fraud. Like that's a. that's a sad existence to like get into that spot where you're like, I'm going to get. I'm going to give it to them, man. I've come up with a scheme, honey, you know someone from the comedy store. I probably can't it

Speaker 1:          01:29:59       sometimes. It's not like that man. See, this is the thing. Like it was nice people, they just didn't know better and I don't say that like they're stupid. I say that like they're just dating. I think they're going to get caught. They didn't think it was that big a deal. They didn't think through it very well. There was one lady was so nice. She, he had a scam. This scam safe your license plate number. He would write down your license plate number and then write down one that was really close to it and write down another one that was really close to that. And then he would knock on your door and he'd say, I hate to bother you. But my girlfriend was in a car accident and the police report where they had the witnesses driver's license number, a, some coffee got spilled on the report and they don't know exactly what the license number is.

Speaker 1:          01:30:44       There's. We've checked these two. It's not them. I have a friend who works in the DMV and they hooked me up and then you tell her an injury. Oh, I'm sorry. What? What happened to a showcase? She's okay, but she did this. Oh my God. I had that same injury. You tell them the injury that they had that's giving them Workman's compensation and had St. that's terrible. Do you guys want to come in and have a cup of coffee? She invites us in that fucking house. Strangers. This is what people did in the eighties, dude. They invited people in the house like pilgrims these crazy. This lady invited two guys into her house and he spins or a yarn about his girlfriend being injured and she said I had the exact same problem. And he said, well, what happened? She said, well, I was on the job as a flight attendant and I fell down and hurt myself, and he goes, Bob, you getting paid aren't you? And she goes, oh, not only getting paid, but I'm also working under my maiden name and another job. He's like, Oh yeah, great, great idea. Way To do it, lady. So Nice. And we got out of there and I was like, man, we can't turn her. And he's like, fuck her. She goes, she goes, she's a fucking crazy. He goes, that lady's a fucking crook. I mean, she's so nice. She let us in her house. She gave us coffee. That's the car.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       I love that Shit, man. I like being nice has somehow become synonymous with not being dangerous or a crook. That's a really funny thing. It's like because being nice is like, that's like a really great costume to put on. Like if you want to camouflage yourself and you're a predator, you know the way lot the tigers wasn't okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:21       Predator. She was just a lady who didn't think it was a big deal to rip off a corporation. People grow up thinking corporations are faceless, nameless entities and you can extract money from them. I think that's the way people think of some liability lawsuits. Like you slip on some water in the hallway and a big building.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       You fall down like, oh, I'm hurt. I'm real hurt. You guys didn't protect me. My balance was compromised and I fell on your ground. Somebody. Somebody put some water on your ground. I'm not responsible for this. I'm going to soup soup. Soup. It's fucked. It's bad that, that, that woman was making a terrible mistake. And your, um, your friend Dolan, dynamite, dickless Dave Dolan and calm. So he helped, he helped her, he helped her, he helped her out because like that kind of shit, that kind of life like dealing, you want to create like a, you want to create a version of that woman were like inside. She didn't feel alone at least a little bad, a little better, a little weak, a little bit off balance course, but reality, the reality is she didn't feel good about that probably. And that's not a great way to live, man. And, and so by getting corrected by the universe in those ways, you know, I think it's a good thing. I'm glad that, you know, some things aren't illegal for example, but they are, you know, like obviously like we agree on some of these things, right? Those things, it's fucked up to bus people for if you're stealing in, uh, in, in, in, in that, in that way. I don't know man. No, you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:33:54       No, you're right. But I would have never turned around. I would have said this. I can't, that would have never been a good private investigator. I just, I, I feel like a lot of those people and I was at the time 21 at the time, at the most 21. I think at that time I was really well aware of like the, the neighborhood where my grandparents grew up, right? Like, and, and being around them and being around my parents who grew up in the sixties and then my grandparents who grew up, I mean they were, they were hearing the depression and they just, there was a different attitude about opportunity. Like everybody was poor. Right. So everybody would like take advantage of every opportunity and if you've got an opportunity to run a scam, you did it. Yeah. And there's this terrible thing that happens in, in poor communities is that people do think of like insurance scams, this kind of scam. Like you know, you gotta think about it like a score, you know, think about it like it's a score. I've heard say that to me

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       right now, an older Italian guys. Look, you've got to think about this. This is a score. Okay? Can't fuck this up. You got an opportunity here. All you have to do is you go to the fucking chiropractor. My back hurts. They can't tell you why your back hurts. Nobody knows why you fucking back hurts. Which is true. You would go to a chiropractor every day and say, my back is fucking killing me. I got a shooting pain down my leg. They can't prove it or disprove it. Next thing you know, you get a $35,000 check in the mail.

Speaker 6:          01:35:22       Oh, right. Yeah. I, you know, man, here's the thing. Number one, I felt like I have to say this, I would not have turned this fucking that woman in if I was not a private investigator, but that'd be in Dolan ethically had to turn her in because if he didn't he would be guilty of stealing from the person who was giving him money to do the job. There was never a question. Right. So that's what he did for a living. He was turned around, but the, the, the main like problem with stealing a like, you know, sometimes I've been hanging out with people you leave a grocery store and somehow they didn't charge for like a, I dunno, a bottle of water or whatever. Like they didn't see it in the car. Right. And the people, some people are like, I did it. Free water.

Speaker 6:          01:36:07       They fucked up. Right. And like man, I think those people are unaware of this like weird law in the universe, which is that you seem to like have to get shipped back times three, it feels like maybe a little bit more than that when you give or take or to. So like if you steal a $2 bottle of water, now this is my superstition, you're going to end up paying like at least six bucks for that bottle of water in some other way. Some Karmic, some shit's going to happen. You're going to get a parking ticket, you're going to get some weird fucking thing. So I think a thief is unaware of a metaphysical economy, which is like, you think you're going to get away with that, but you're not like, if you could really get away with it, it would give me pause. But like I've noticed man, all my friends who are really successful, they leave giant fucking tips, crazy tips, crazy tips, you know, a few of these people, Joe tips were like, it makes the waitress cry.

Speaker 6:          01:37:15       And also I've noticed they will dodge out of a place before they can be acknowledged for leaving some insanely massive tip to. I'm right here. You don't have to talk about milk. I'm not here, I just don't want to fuck it. Embarrass you man. Because it's like, you know, a lot of don't. But the main thing is like that's a love bomb. That's why I was called up. Yeah, leave a love bomb for the winter. Right. But I think also there's another side to it that is more than just like the feeling you get of knowing you've been generous and you're not that attached to money. No,

Speaker 5:          01:37:48       it's not even that. So you get an opportunity to give a nudge in a positive. They feel good so that they feel good. It looks so. It gives you a hundred dollar tip for a fucking cup of coffee or something. They get this feeling like, Holy Shit. All of a sudden a beautiful feeling of a normal situation, just a normal interaction. I give you this and you can give me that. And I say, thank you. And I go, well, in that normal interaction, all of a sudden, boom. You get this beautiful gift from a stranger that didn't know how to do have to do that for no reason at all. Just a little love bomb. Yeah. It's. It's even better when you're not there when you're in the car driving and they realize you left before him.

Speaker 6:          01:38:23       Right, see that thing right there, man, that if you go back to what we were talking about about momentum.

Speaker 5:          01:38:29       Yeah. Puts a little ripples out there. Those ripples spread. Yeah, and it's not just with that obviously do it with money. No, it's being nice to people. Sometimes. I've had days where like I'm just walking somewhere and someone looks at me and they go, hey, hi. How are you? Everything good? Yeah, man, everything's good. How you doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Enjoy the day. It's just so nice little friendly interaction with some person who never met before and for no reason. Just wants to be a nice guy. Those make you feel good, man. Those are. Those are nice moments and contract. Conversely, weird moments that I've had where people that are distracted and they're looking at their phone, they're not paying attention. I'm like, this fucking dummy that almost ran into me. I don't have to think that, whether it's a dumb way to think, but I do think it, especially if it's like a kid, you know, some fucking kid just trying to push it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:17       Where's the opposing army? And they almost run into you like, hey dude, your phone. Right, right. They are radiating this momentum into the world. They're not interacting with people that are there. Versus a person who's like genuinely nice is I just see someone walking down the street and they say, good morning, good morning. Yeah. And everybody feels good. That's just a nice little thing like that. That's right. Those are those men, those spread, that person might do it to the next person they meet and then boom, everybody's saying hi to everybody and everybody's hugging everybody. This is it. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:39:48       That's. We talk about this probably every time because we both agree that this is like probably if there was going to be a nonviolent revolution in this country that wasn't based on voting, it's going to start with that. And, and, and, uh, in what is that, you know, in, in the, the thing I'm being taught is that thing you're talking about, it can be cultivated and refined so you can sort of, that's why it's called a practice. Like when you're sitting and you're watching your breath and you're learning how to be in the moment instead of thinking, I'm doing this for this reason or that like I'm doing this because when I'm like talking to somebody, they're going to think I'm spiritual. I'm doing this because I want to be more focused. I'm doing this because I have an anxiety disorder. I'm doing this because of this or that.

Speaker 6:          01:40:37       That's great. But there's another reason to do it, which is that, uh, if you get really good at being in the moment with people and also when you're sitting with yourself, uh, and learning who you are, you have to start applying a lot of compassion to yourself because you're going to sit man and you're going to. Some shit's going to float to the surface of the stream that you wish had stayed under some rocks. Man, you're going to see not just shit that's been done to you, but you're going to see shit that you've done other people and you're going to have to deal with that. Right? And the. And the way to deal with that is, is not to do like, I don't know if you do this at all, but sometimes like I will remember something from when I was very young and be like, you fucking Dick.

Speaker 6:          01:41:22       I'll say it out loud to nobody yelling does someone like 15 years ago, right? Yelling at you at my past self like you motherfucker, you know, what have you got me into with my memory's Jesus Christ ban? Why were you doing that? Why did you do that? And so that's like the opposite of compassion for the self. Right? So anyway, the point is if you can like sort of cultivate compassion for who you are right now, that's not to say use that as an excuse to not try to become a kinder person. But I'm saying cultivate compassion for the fact that like, man, your dad had ptsd and you're fucking a folks got divorced when you were three and your dad remarried an abusive woman who hated your fucking guts for seven fucking years. And she did some really bad things to you over the course of that time that you are way too young to process or you had no, you had no way to deal with that and now when you're in, you're in your twenties or thirties, you're realizing that you seem to be kind of a selfish cunt.

Speaker 6:          01:42:37       And it's like, well, yeah, the reason you're being a selfish quote comment is because you had to build up a very high powered defense mechanism to deal with the fact that you were abused for almost a decade when your brain was forming more neurons than it ever will at any other point in its life. And now we can start having compassion for ourselves. Instead of thinking, I'm a selfish cunt. We could think, oh, I've got too big a force field up. I've developed a thing to protect me from an environment that I'm no longer in. And then the point is, once you start becoming compassionate to yourself, that's when you run into the person who's being a selfish cunt, who you can look at and say, oh, I see you. I know you are. I don't know what it was. I don't know if it was an abusive parent. I don't know if it was a heartbreak. I don't know if it's something you read. I don't know if it was something I don't know. Maybe genetic, I don't know, but I know from looking into myself enough to know that you deserve more compassion than you're getting. That's it. So we have this agreement that everybody

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       can learn up to a certain point. Right? We agree that pretty much everyone who's normal and not impaired mentally can learn how to read. Right. We agree this, we agree to this. I think say, yeah, we agree to simple mathematics. Everyone can learn how to add and subtract and multiply and after that it gets a little squirrely with division people can't come, but we're. We're agreeing that with minimal paying attention in school, we could all achieve a certain level. Yes, but there's very little very little attention ever paid to considering how you behave and how you think and how you observe yourself and how you correct mistakes and how you learn from the past. It's never taught. It's one of the most important things I've ever learned in my life is to to not cling onto the past, but don't forget it either. That's great.

Speaker 1:          01:44:45       Remember that you fucked up. Don't do it again, but don't live in this world of 20 years ago or 30 years ago or whatever. That one instance where you wish you didn't say this one thing to some person or hit some person or drive your car where you should and whatever the fuck it is, whatever. Whatever thing that it was that you still sit back and go, God, yeah. You know, I've, I rear ended. Somebody wants with my car when I was on my way to selling it and I wasn't paying attention at a red light and my scars. I had a, I think it was a 1978 oldsmobile cutlass and the front end. I crunched this guy's bumper with the fiberglass part of my car. Didn't do shit to his car. He had a truck, but I fucked up my car on the way to selling it and I brought it to this person and the grill was like half hanging off and I remember in my car just going, fuck, fuck, I just fucking.

Speaker 1:          01:45:41       I was. I was so broke and such a loser. I'm barely keeping it together and on my way to selling this car, I fucked it up and I was just like, you fucking loser. Yeah. I remember being in my car screaming at myself, you fucking loser. And I remember the guy bought it anyway, just took a bunch of money off of it. I forget what we agreed on. Um, but, but this feeling would haunt me for months, for months. I'd be doing other things and I would think of rear ended that car not paying attention fucking up the. I'm like, yeah, because it wasn't even like an accident. It was like I left my foot off the gas and it just slammed into somebody because I wasn't paying attention. Right. Oh yeah. So I let my foot off the brake rather. It was, it was something that I literally was defining myself by for months. I was thinking that I was a loser because I did this. Yeah. Yeah, that's it right there. I said like, Hey asshole, don't let your foot off the brake. Pay attention what you're doing. You're driving a fucking car. I know you're only 18, but pay attention to what the fuck you're doing. It wasn't, it wasn't that it was you fucking you fucking

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       loser. Screaming at myself, Dude. I was talking to this, this dude at one of these randazzo retreats. He's like in his twenties and like, I'm, I'm really, by the way, this wasn't a row. I'm like really, like veiling the person very, very deeply here. But the point is this person was telling me some shitty thing that had happened to them when they were a kid. Right. And a real young and uh, like it happened like at a, at a doctor's office. The doctor, like it was like a shitty doctor or something, I don't know. But the doctor like slap, slap the kid, right? Geez. Yeah. And so, uh, for what reason? Well, there's no reason is there joe, like there's really no reason to slap a kid. He's come to a doctor's office. Right? So for sure. Right. What was the reasonable thing? The kids, that's the thing my friend said.

Speaker 6:          01:47:47       My friend said, well, I was squirming around. Oh Geez. He hadn't considered. He hadn't even considered that he was five. So like I said to him, I'm like, hey man, have. When was the last time you picked up a five year old? Do you know how small five-year-olds are? Do you understand that you didn't do anything wrong? Did that was a shitty doctor that was a crazy fucking doctor and your whole life to rationalize the fact that sometimes big people are crazy and slap little people. You tried to apply some logic or like tilt to the act itself right now, that's a heavy burden to carry because if you think you're a bad five-year-old, you're probably going to think you're a bad 30. God knows are going to think you're a bad 35 year old. All the crazy shit you can do when you're 35.

Speaker 6:          01:48:43       So it's like that mentality of looking back on our former self and hating it is the very same reason that we hate others. It's identical. If I'm going to hate myself, definitely I'm giving myself permission. Eight everybody else around me. And that's so the work is let's figure out how to like be compassionate to our former selves and not just when we were fucking kids in a doctor's office and not just 10 years ago and not just 20 years ago, like start and start now. Like right now, because you're sitting on top of a card house made of memory. Right? And it's like that. You're the entire thing. So you got to love it all and then then if you start doing that shit, I have noticed your degree of country drops by a lot. It's not going to go away. It will definitely, at least for me,

Speaker 5:          01:49:49       I mean, one of the things that we've, I've had many guys asked me before, why do you, why are you so insistent on exercise? It's a big one. Do you really think it helps you? I'm like, I know it helps me. I don't want. It's like jerking off, but for the body, like instead of the, the, this, this thing that you get when you jerk off this relief from the need for sex, there's an noticed tension that's constantly in your bio that flavors the way you think about things. It really just does. Um, last night my daughter was upset at something. She had gotten to a little tiffed with one of her friends, super upset and really her friend, she thought her friend was being mean and just didn't, you know, trying to deal with it. We went into the garage and uh, I said, let's just go.

Speaker 5:          01:50:37       We'll work out. You'll feel better. And I put the pads on and we started moving around, start throwing some kicks and punches, start breaking a sweat. Really getting into whap whap whap and getting him, Woo. This is fun. And then laughing and joking around and then we talked about it because I'm like, now you can talk about it rationally because now it's not fucking with you too. You have this energy that's pent up. Yeah. You got to let that energy out and then you're left with the thoughts. But too many people get stuck with the energy and the thought and the energy is overwhelming the thought, and it's like, oh, this fucking emotional. Yeah, and I run around the block or a fucking hitting the heavy bag or hitting the pads or skip some grub or whatever you're into. Take a yoga class. Whatever you wind, do, drain the stress out of the body and then look at the object and the, the idea for what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:51:26       And this is a fucking important method of managing the way you think about things that people overlook. They overlook the impact of physical tension on the body and your decision making process. Uh, wow. Yeah. Do do you a. do you believe that trauma is stored in the body? You think that's bullshit? I don't know. I mean, I know that trauma is something that clings inside your subconsciousness. Your subconsciousness is a part of your consciousness. Your consciousness supposedly resides in your body. So why wouldn't it be in your body somehow way, shape or form, right? You know, there's also the idea that there's parts of your body that retained memory, not just your brain, but there's neurons in your body and perhaps they retain memory, like there's the concept that this apparent there's some type of neuron in the heart, right? Yes. And this is what a lot of people believe was responsible for this idea of like follow your heart, follow your heart.

Speaker 5:          01:52:20       Maybe if those are your memories and your, your database of collective emotional ideas. If there's really something to that and like maybe it's not just in the brain area but also in the heart area and in all the neurons. Maybe we just, we just think because our consciousness resides in the brain, that all of our memories reside there as well and that they're not in various areas of our body. People that get transplants, man, one of the weird things that they say, they, they find that they have cravings for things like the person who donated the Oregon. Right? Right. I don't know if that's real or not because obviously I've never gone through a transplant, but

Speaker 2:          01:52:56       I've heard that shit a lot too. And, and someone was explaining it to me like, well, like, Oh god, here comes fucking Bro. Scientists Trust. Get ready. Here we go. I'm ready. Dr Trussell. I've got a fucking masters degree in Bro. Science. Oh yeah. Dude do. Are you working tonight? Yeah, Dude. I am like, yeah, why? What's going on? Ice House? I can't do it. That's okay. I'm a dude. Thank you so much though on. I was just thinking before I do my bro Science thing, man, your daughter's fucking lucky. God Damn Your Dad's like, let's go to the gym in the House and fucking kickbox you're upset. That's super cool man. I was just thinking that. The other thing. Well it's

Speaker 5:          01:53:43       only cool if they like it. The thing is she likes to do it. This is one thing that I think is extremely important because I see people that get their son to play football because they played football and the kid doesn't want to play fucking football. Yeah, man, you got to let your kids be who they are. They get super resentful. I've seen people raise their kids and try to force their kids into holes. You got to support them and love them and let them find their path. You have to. You have to let them find their path. You can't decide they're going to be a doctor or decide they're going to be a lawyer. Decide they're going to be whatever the fuck you want them to be. They they got to be what they are. We're all so different and you are literally robbing a kid of their future.

Speaker 5:          01:54:22       If you over influence their choice making in terms of like not following their passion or their dream or their ideas. You and it can be done, and this is to say that it can't be done is it's all so many people can't do it. So many people don't get their doctorate. So many people don't ever become scientists or astronauts or fucking mathematicians. A lot of things are hard to do, man, right? A lot of things. Right, but you can't decide the way that kids brain works. You're not in there, right? You're not in there and it's different than yours and hers is different than his right. His brother is different than this sister and the mom is different than all of them and you've got to let people be. You got to let them be. You have to in people don't. And those fucking people hate their parents.

Speaker 5:          01:55:08       Those people did to develop this fucking resentment because there's no freedom there. Fucking mom is always on. I'm mom. I don't want to do that. You just stopped. I raised you. I didn't raise you to talk to me like this. You're my son. I don't want you being a loser. Do you? Will get it. Do you understand it? Like, ah, yeah, I don't want to be a doctor. Yeah. I'm so disappointed in you. I know friends where their parents don't talk to them anymore because they changed majors. Yeah, they changed majors. A Dad stop talking to them. What side? Yo, you don't want. You don't want to take on the company business. You don't want to take the company. You have. The idea

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       was we were going to send you to go to school when you were going to take over the company business. Yeah. Maybe in a band you fucking loser.

Speaker 6:          01:55:50       Some people have a really. It's like we got to be so much kinder to people when you just think in shit like that helps you understand how people are like you run into just about anybody man, and it's like so easy to, to have someone in your life and enjoy the idea that they're an asshole and they deserve it, but if you spend just a speck of time thinking about it, it's like if we really sat in a weird way, it sucks.

Speaker 1:          01:56:17       We'll just wait until you have kids. Then it gets really, really interesting because you start looking at people like they used to be babies. That's what happened to me. Boy, come and man, are you do I don't like? Yeah, this is the first place I've said it. Holy Shit Daddy.

Speaker 6:          01:56:33       She said it's okay. You know you get when, when you're in the early Montero. I don't know

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       why, but like if you're scared, it's such a sacred thing. You know? It's a vulnerable thing to talk about. It makes you feel vulnerable. It makes you feel nervous and because of the energy or you're worried about talking to fucking love it,

Speaker 6:          01:56:53       it is the most transformative, like, you know, like you hear all the time to the point where I was like suspicious of it. Like I was like, you know, I don't stand up has done this job for awhile, so I think I'm allowed to say I urge you not, should I not even what's, what's the.

Speaker 1:          01:57:10       Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't do any. His old stuff.

Speaker 6:          01:57:12       He's got some of my favorite jokes of all time. Many of them. But he's got this killer fucking joke about Alva like a pregnant people are like heroin addicts, you know? They're like, just try it. You'll love it. Just try it. And then. And then when you do it, like, you know, you're stuck, you're trapped. Which is how I used to think. But man, it's so humbling to realize that all this shit you heard that was true in the sense that you hear people say, oh no, it's psychedelic psychedelic. Now I, I always associated that with like when the baby's born, there must be some serotonin or dopamine that gets released, not just in the woman. We know the woman's brain is flooded with oxytocin and a variety of things. The mother, the bonding chemicals, but you know, I thought, well that clearly would happen for the father, maybe just not in the same level.

Speaker 6:          01:58:07       So when people say it's Psychedelic, that must be what they meet, but now I know you know, the birth is, hasn't happened yet, but just being in the presence of a person who's growing a life inside of their belly and realizing that like the bonding that's happening there and like the sacred duty is coming up. If you being a father and that a soul is coming into this dimension that is going to be. I'm completely dependent on you and my wife course wanting to keep her safe and then man, it. The combination of all these things is so incredibly psychedelic and the most beautiful way and so humbling because it's like, boy, oh boy, did I fucking tell myself that. I'd figured out something really smart and that was like reproduction is a trick of the DNA and this marriage thing and the baby thing is some kind of vast digital societal Oregon, like the opinion decks.

Speaker 6:          01:59:18       We don't need to do that. There's nothing to it. Obviously I wasn't using that voice, but like, it was such a pretentious fucking pompous, ridiculous place that I was standing at, which is to judge people for reproducing, having, enjoying the ability to judge because my parents reproduced. You know what I mean? So it's so humbling to realize like, oh, I was wrong, but I wasn't just like kinder on, like I was deeply fundamentally, completely wrong about this phase of life in this. Uh, what's the word for it? This, um, well, I like, in Hinduism they call it an Ostrom, like a monastery. It's called the Green Hosta Ostrom. It's like a temple. It's considered to be like a temple. The family. Holy Fuck Man. It's real. The rubbers hit the road man. And it's like, it's really, really beautiful though,

Speaker 5:          02:00:25       obviously a little scary. Yeah, it's love. It's real love. And it's love where you know you're going to be able to love your children unconditionally in a in a very strange way that we really have a hard time with other people. And I think the thing about it is not just that you're bringing a life into this world which is very psychedelic, but that your love bond with this kid is so ultimate. It's so. It's so intense. The love that you have for each other to raising the kid together. There's a thing that happens with people when they are just really deeply connected at a DNA level. Like this is a little person that is literally come out of nowhere from two bodies and it's. It makes you realize how precious life is, how vulnerable we all are. And it makes you realize that it's such a cliche phrase, the actual power of love. And then it's not just the love of this kid or the love of yourselves, the two together and the family together and all the other people that you love. It's a love of all people. It's the love. It's just if we just really have a hard time loving people, we have a really hard time. The people going to love us

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       back or they're not gonna get in our way. They're not going to be overly needy or annoying or they're not going to be intrusive or they're not going to tell you what to do, which is why people hate their fucking parents telling them what to do. Oh, it comes with this bullshit. Love comes with this nonsense. Love comes with fucking rules and I have to be annoyed all the time. I have to wear my suit on Sunday. Fuck love. Fuck it. I don't want it. Then that carries on. You develop these, the shields that you put up for the whole world. Because of that. That's one of the most common things that people do when, when in terms of like our definitions of love, we define it by the people that were supposed to be the lovers in our lives, but they'll just unconditional kindness and love so so few people are balanced.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       In the beginning of the relationship. It's just lust and then after awhile you get annoyed with each other and you can't wait to get free and find somebody else who's going to make you happy. They don't make you happy either. And most of us in the early years of our lives in particular, we bounce around, you know, we try to find a new person that's gonna make us happy and we attract the kind of people that are the most destructive for us. I mean for some strange reason, we're always looking to be distracted. Yes. And when I think when you can learn how to abandon that and it's not a learned. Like now I know it's a slow gradual process where the instances of continuous occur less frequently, right? Less and less and less and less frequently to your more and more and more kind. And then you, you know, you get it as good as you can get it on, on any given day.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       And that's part of being the hairless ape in this strange land of electronics and you know, and concrete buildings. We're still trying to figure out the rules to this completely new way of living. And part of this completely new way of living has shifted over the last 10 years and that's where the Internet comes in the last 10, 20 years, no more than 24 years. The whole world's changed topsy turvy up to down. I mean the whole thing is just different now. It's a different reality. Anybody from any point in the past, if you transport them to today, they'd be living in some fucking blade runner movie. I mean it really is a Ridley Scott Film. You know for sure. If you were living in the 19 fifties and someone brought you to 2018 and picked you up from the airport and a tesla, you're on a plane.

Speaker 1:          02:04:00       Seems normal playing just like planes. What are these screens on the seats? Holy Shit. And screens in the seats and someone picks you up in a tesla. It doesn't make any noise. It's electric. There's a giant laptop in the front of it. It shows this huge map and you're driving around and people are taking phone calls in the air. It just, Hey, what's up Mike? You're like, what? You're talking in the car? What the fuck, uh, driving around to all these different places and you see the, the, the mass of humans and the architecture change and people would freak the fuck out with the and this is the world that we've totally, completely become accustomed to. That's right, and no one, no one's for this. We're all just playing it on ear and the worst aspects of it that some of the chaos and those social upheaval and the way the being, the infighting between people, people getting kicked out of restaurants because they work for the wrong people and put this.

Speaker 1:          02:04:53       If you see maxine waters telling people that if you find people that it worked for the trump administration, you find them in a restaurant. You find them anywhere. You go and you get together a group of people. You build a crowd and you let them know that you don't agree with their policies like, Whoa, we're calling for gangs were calling for gangs of people randomly industry to interrupt people's meals, interrupt people in stores. Get a crowd together. Don't let them be in. Be Safe in public because you disagree with their policies. Woo. This is getting crazy and I know one of the policies of the immigrants, the children of immigrants being separated from their parents, which I'm 100 percent with you. It's immoral. It's disgusting. It saddens me that it's even considered an option. It makes no sense. I don't give a fuck if they broke the law.

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       You don't take parents and kids and separate them. You just fucking don't. It's just disgusting. There's other ways around it. If you're saying, well, they shouldn't have broke the law. Maybe they shouldn't have broke the law. You don't get to do something that's a thousand times worse than crossing a line that dirt, that fucking imaginary line in the dirt crossing. That is nothing in comparison to your crime of stealing a baby from its mother. That's fucking insane. That's not American. Two thousand 18. That's just insane and we wouldn't be doing that to Canadians. Okay. If Canadians came over here with their beautiful, cute blond haired kids, just were not stealing them from their parents, and that's one of the reasons why it's sick. The whole thing sick. It's chaos. So in one hand, on one hand I understand where a lot of people were outraged and I understand where they're coming from. You shouldn't separate parents from the children in any way, shape or form, but the way to fix that, as not saying anybody who's on that team and working for that administration should be chased by a mob of street vigilantes. And you should encourage this mom, make a crowd, get everybody together, make a crowd, make some noise, let them know they're not welcomed. Like, Whoa,

Speaker 2:          02:06:45       well isn't. It isn't like who. One of the, one of the problems with it is now we have a little bit of a slippery slope. Like we let's, you know, I don't want to play mob justice ping pong with you, right? Because if I start playing that with you, they're not ping pong could potentially turn into a civil war. Do you know there was a reason

Speaker 1:          02:07:10       USA Today poll that said 31 percent of America thinks that we're close to a civil war

Speaker 2:          02:07:15       right now. Now that being said no. And also people who like fantasize about a civil war, I don't know if they've really thought it out all the way, like what that looks like. I can answer that for you. They definitely have it. Right. So definitely have it because if they did and they thought

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       it through and thought it was a good idea, they're out of their fucking minds. They're crazy or they're stupid.

Speaker 6:          02:07:41       Yeah. But, but was really passionate about that and that man. Well, I mean because he will, he wants to fucking be in a goddamn civil war. But the, the, the, you know, for me when I see shit like that going down, um, I, I see, I, I've like come up with like I didn't come up with, I got it from the Dalai Lama, but I've come up with like a good little equation to, to go back to which is does this reduce suffering? Right. So like, and I don't think it, it reduces suffering. And, and these people who are really upset on both sides of the fence are suffering. Like we're, we're really looking at like a world where a lot of people are deeply upset, deeply suffering, and really scared and really, really, really freaking the fuck out. And, and as I've been watching this thing emerge on the Internet, on twitter where people tweet things that paint that you look at it and you think it's almost as though you're living in another world than I am like the world that you're, you're talking about man, it's fucking terrifying.

Speaker 6:          02:09:00       Like it's scary and it's like it's, it's really fucked up. And maybe like the reason I think that is because I started doing lsd when I was 16, so when I was, when I was 16 I w r I became brutally aware of the fact that the current government in the past government was repressive and, and, and I, and something about that drug, which I don't do anymore because it's illegal. I was a crazy kid. But something about that drug really shows you the conditioning. Right? And so I knew from a pretty young age, I was like, Oh wow, I don't, I don't think the United States is, is dropping bombs on other countries because of justice or some threat. It appears to be that some people are making money off of this shit and I don't think these drugs are illegal because they're bad for you. I think they're illegal because somebody doesn't want the herd to experience these states of consciousness because it will make them more difficult to share.

Speaker 1:          02:10:13       I had this conversation with Hamilton Morris yesterday and he strongly disagrees because he's talked to the people actually in the dea if she's talked to the people in drug and forest for sure. And he said that what really is happening is they have zero experience with these drugs, but they know these drugs are illegal and so they pursue it as if it's a viable target. And we talked about it in terms of the real problem with law enforcement

Speaker 5:          02:10:33       being that it's a game. I've always said that the real problem with tops is not cops. The real problem with cops is human nature. This is a bad guy. I get a point if I take him out, you start looking for bad guys. He started looking for bad guys that aren't even there. You start forcing situation.

Speaker 6:          02:10:47       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know comes. Yeah. Sorry. No, go ahead. We get into this a lot. I and I don't mean the dea, like I've heard the exact same thing about the dea. Like they don't, they,

Speaker 5:          02:10:58       I think people above them have experienced.

Speaker 6:          02:11:01       I'm not even, I'm not even talking about people above them. I'm talking about tendencies. So like if an individual has a tendency, right? Like um, tendency. So a person has a tendency than a group of people might have a tendency. For example, if I get a group of Swedish people together and I'd bring them to the World Cup, they're going to have the tendency to cheer for Sweden. Right? I'm going to bet on that. I gamble on that. There's a tendency, right? My boss fucking sucks. He's a fucking asshole. Right? Then you think back to the way all your other boss has acted and you realize like, wait, there seems to be a tendency when people are in that position of power to behave in a certain way. Right. Hard, hard job. So, so, but what I'm saying is, is the person who's in the position of power, is that thing coming from inside of them or is it that there something like built in to the DNA of a leadership position?

Speaker 6:          02:12:00       They say that like in the same way like when you got a pregnant wife, some new thing kicks in and I was reading about it, built in. It feels like where it's like I'm getting a fucking security system. I'm fucking like, you know what I mean? I'm, I want to make her safe. I want to make sure that like we're, we're saving money. We're like, you know what I mean, I'm working harder than I've ever worked in my fucking life because I want to make sure that like there's plenty for her and plenty for the kid and like something kicks in. There is a tendency there. Right? So what I'm saying is if there seems to be a tendency that happens when there is a, uh, a convergence of people in power, right? It starts behaving in a certain way. It builds walls, it starts taking people to jail who don't belong in jail.

Speaker 6:          02:12:46       It dehumanizes essentially. That's the fucking tendency, right? And so when you're taking a psychedelic and you look around and you realize, oh, I see the government though, it's filled with people who are wonderful. There are people in the fucking dea who listened to your show and guaranteed love the show. And I'm like, you're fucking right man. I don't want to enforce these goddamn laws. Arresting people for a thing that is like being shown not only to be harmless, but potentially therapeutic. There's people in all branches of government and there's some people who just need a job and maybe there's some assholes in there.

Speaker 5:          02:13:20       Well, there's some people that want to bus crack dealers. You want to bust assholes that are killing people, happen to also be drug dealers. And this is part of the job. So I'm not talking about the individual atomic structure

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       of the power structure, I'm talking about the sum total convergence, the gestalt of the thing imminate certain behavior patterns and those fucking behavior patterns. Those behavior patterns have been going on for a very long time and so forever, forever as far as we know, there's always been kings. So now I'm not saying therefore your fear, your terror is unjustified. I just think maybe because of the garishness of the current administration compared to like Obama who is like, you know, we know what happened with Obama and, and I say we know what happened with Obama and the drones. We know what happened. Well, we don't know what all the shit that probably happened with Obama, but we do know with Obama, and I remember hearing this and then looking it up and then looking it up again. Uh, he apparently liked deported. In fact, maybe please find out if I'm wrong about this.

Speaker 6:          02:14:27       I don't have to deal with 7 billion people calling me a fucking motherfucker for the rest of my life. But apparently he deported more people than any than all American presidents combined. His administration did. Right. Deported more people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and, and so now trump, he, he's at the beginning of the fucking deportation race. Like by the time he's done, he might have beaten Obama and score by a long shot. I don't fucking know. But the main thing is what I'm saying here is like, I think I've been aware of the fact that there is something wonky going on and it's wonky in the most rotten brutal way. It's wonky in the sense that it kills people. It separates children from families, not just of immigrants, but if farmers, some people were growing marijuana and guaranteed their kids are in foster care now and they're in fucking jail.

Speaker 6:          02:15:19       Right. This has been going on and on and on and on. I think maybe now it's great about the fear that we're seeing in the hyper reaction is if there is anything great about it, is that people are waking up to the fact that our government right now, the American government is out of balance. We've been at war for 90 percent of our history, right, and there's a lot of shit going on in there that doesn't need to be going on and we're waking up to it. It's just some people are like, they're waking up to it like they were asleep and someone threw water in their face and they're like, oh fucking shit. Holy fucking shit. This is like, you know, this happened, this sounds condescending. I don't mean it to be, but when I was like 18 or 17, looking at a fucking dollar bell tripping balls, looking at that fucking green pyramid and the weird symbols and then thinking like, wait a minute, this, this is covered with a cult symbology all over it, all over it. And then thinking like, wait a minute, wait, there's something, this should, this should, this isn't really worth anything. Like this is just paper. And then setting it on fire, you know, just to do like the worst

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       thing, like a joke obviously because it's illegal to set it on fire. Right? Yeah, of course. It's a joke. I will never fucking do that man. No Way. I never ever in a million years would ignite currency, not with old glory now without glory, not with the fucking money, but I guess what I'm saying is like if there is something positive about and I, the mobs of people doing this or that or the other, the hyper outrage almost as though we're looking at an immune response. Like that's kind of going over board. Right? Exactly. But if there's something positive in it, it's that it seems that huge swaths of people are becoming familiar with the machinations of the American empire and understanding that here's how it's working right now. And um,

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       well not only that, like this illusion that it worked far differently when Obama was in office, like, have you seen that video? Or Obama was running for president and he started talking about how to deal with immigration and the immigration policies. Now it's disturbing video because it's a republican viewpoint. He's the way he's talking about it, it sounds like someone running for a conservative position now. It's not like this democratic socialist idea of eliminating ice. You know, there's a lot of people that are there ideas that immigration, customs enforcement, those people are monsters and we should eliminate the position. We shouldn't have it anymore and we should have open borders. And those, those same people would love to have Obama in office. You know, they would think that it would be great if Obama was here. Boy, who was so much better when Obama was here. Back play that video, find the video of Obama. Uh, I think it was, I want to say 2007 or eight or something like that, something like that. But it's one of those ones where you're like, Whoa, wait a minute, what? Two thousand five. You watch it and you go, what? Yeah. Wow. Like this sounds like a Republican. Like imagine. Let's just imagine and imagine this is a young blonde white man who's saying this in 2018. Listen to this, listen to listen to is his position

Speaker 2:          02:18:38       dude with one of us is like square on the need to better secure the border at a punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants. You know, we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States, but those who entered the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law. Wait, can you pause that? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. May I ask for a pots? What's the date on that video? Two thousand five, that's for sure. The date on the actual upload. Flashback 2005, seven, zero. S, uh, Senator Obama and immigration. You use 31st 2017. Okay. Now here's the thing, man, his lips. Look, I be bullshit. I've looked at that. Obama has deported more people than any American president, but we have to be very careful these days because if you look, his lips aren't tracking. Oh, let me see. Let me see. Yeah, go back

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       and look at the or showing disregard for those who are following the law cannot come out. Yeah. Oh yeah. Does not tracking it all? Well, why don't you? Well, someone would know if that was a real cspan thing. I think we need to better secure the border and a punish employers choose to hire illegal immigrants. I'm not saying this because I'm shocked that yeah, but it's just off, but it's the same words. They all agree. He's saying the same words. Can we find a version of it where it doesn't do that? Sorry, you guys these days, man. I like so like, and this is how we're going to deal with even more like. And also I'm not saying like you would never do that. I'm just saying that looks a little fishy, but you can just look up. Did Obama deported more people than those looking at it

Speaker 8:          02:20:12       before you asked me to fund the video and I'm finding various problems in that, that statement or statistics. So snopes has it, but they've changed it to a mixture instead of being true or false because the definition of a deportation was changed at some point in the last couple of years. The

Speaker 4:          02:20:28       point is he deported a lot of people, you know, like, I don't know, like how many are. I don't know. It wasn't Justin Trudeau. He wasn't just open borders that nobody in. But dude, let's please find out if that fucking clip was actually sitting. We would know. We would know if that clip is bullshit. There's no way they would just let it slide if Obama never said that. There's no way they would just let that stay was sinked. Well then you would kind of know because that's a pretty famous clip and it gets used all the time. She spends website, right? We all agree on the need to better secure what's up with the fucking dream was declared illegal immigrants. We are a generous and welcoming people still offstage. So yeah. You guys are also watching a version that's going through three different. Are you watching it?

Speaker 4:          02:21:14       When was it published? When was that uploaded? This was uploaded 2005. Okay, great. Perfect. Sorry you guys. You've got to be careful these days. That man, because they're fucking putting out shit that looks real. That is not. I listened to that radio lab one where they were showing how good it is today. It's fucking. It's close. It's real close to being indistinguishable. Especially for you and I. Yeah. You and I have hundreds of hours of us talking shit and saying things that are ridiculous. I mean, we have, you and I together probably have over a hundred podcasts. We've done way TC that stupid shit. People make us say, man, I, it's going to be so fucking embarrassing. It's embarrassing for you if you watch it, like there's a million things to watch and to watch people put words in your mouth. Yeah. You don't have to keep moving, keep moving. But Dude, let's get back to this. I like this topic here that we're talking about, which is like this. There's A. There's an imbalance here. There's definitely an imbalance. I think that imbalance is being exposed by peoples' real opinion and this is one of the reasons why actual education and actual like raising of human beings is going to be in critically, critically important. Whereas we ignored it as being not for awhile. Well, it's way more important now because the community

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       has gotten closer than ever. The community of humans and by not respecting this community and not really concentrating on the way people behave and think rather than what they own or what their job title is or what degree they have, instead of concentrating on the. One of the things that's most important for us is the way we interact with each other, right? Um, we, we have created this issue where now that everyone has a word in, you've got all these broken people chime in, in throwing an insult bombs and look, anytime a woman is in the news who does something remotely questionable, the color of brigade comes out in full force on twitter and it's all these fake accounts and eggs and some people in real accounts and just want attention and they just attack. I mean, this is just a, this is a real thing and it's not just women, but they do it to men, to women.

Speaker 5:          02:23:21       It always takes on a particularly viable, creepy. It's like finally I get to say this thing and what? Well, what has happened there? Well, somebody's got raised badly. Somebody, somebody did a terrible job raising a man that got them to this position with this broken bundle of emotions and memories and they're all fucked up with no self esteem. And then they find some little target online. Whatever it is, fuck you Duncan Trussell, you fucking sell out, faggot. And next thing you know, they're attacking you and you might just be about to go to the movies with your wife and you read that, like, what the fuck is this guy's problem, man, I didn't do anything. You put your phone down and you go into that theater and you're all pissed off and fucking tweet him back, but you should this. You can't. There's too many people.

Speaker 5:          02:23:59       There's too many people. Too many people. The bad thing is you're going to miss a lot of good people, but the good thing is you're going to put a lot out. Look. You Go. You have to put a lot of good out there, but you can't dwell too much in the back. We're going to get through this. This is a tumultuous adolescent stage of human interaction. Yeah, that's right. That's what's happening. We're going to get through this and reach a much higher level of understanding of each other in a higher level of understanding of community and this is why all these school shootings are happening and all this chaos and people driving trucks into crowds and shit. It's because people are feeling out of this, this, this project of civilization and culture. They feel horribly suicidal and depressed and confused and hateful and angry and they're filled up with chemicals and pharmaceuticals and loneliness and despair and anger and resentment and religious fervor and whatever the fuck else is pushing them through this life and then they react.

Speaker 5:          02:24:56       They explode and this more explode all over the place, but we got to take away the tools of explosion. No, you've got to figure out why people are exploding. How come no one is concentrating on why people were exposed was exploding every once the women want to go, it's toxic masculinity and the men want to go. We're raising pussies and nobody wants to figure out what the fuck it is and they just hope that it doesn't happen again and then it happens again. In the argument starts up and Ted nugent calls everybody at coc and the fucking people that want to guns taken away. They all fucking storm in and they demand and they ended the streak in front of the senator's house at 2:00 in the morning. Brigade roles in copper grade rolls in. They started tweeting up a storm. Yeah. Yeah, and this is, this is where we're at, where we're not examining the behavior and the development of the human being.

Speaker 5:          02:25:46       It's a nonissue in our culture. It's one of the most important things about being a person. You got to wait till you get to be 30 and he'd take a fuck. An Anthony Robbins seminar. I try to get your shit together with some Voodoo preacher down in Malibu that's doing some rock and roll church Christian thing and all the cool people go, oh Jeez. Oh Jeez. Oh, it's amazing. The guy plays piano and he fucks everybody. He can. It's chaos. This is where we are. This is where we are. We're this tumultuous stage where all this information's flowing around and we got to come up with management skills management skills for behavior and communication.

Speaker 6:          02:26:21       That's right. And we have to recognize that we're all in this together. Dude, I love that description is such a perfect description and I think that's, uh, that's, that's the main thing for everyone is freaked out to remind themselves stuff. It's like, yeah, of course you're freaked out. Of course you should be the right way to feel in a snow storm. This is, you're going to feel like I can't quite see what's up. So like definitely I have to be more compassionate when I, when I see people are super freaking out because sometimes I judge them and then they should be. We all have to be more compassionate to ourselves. But then, so if this is the state of chaos and you're talking about management skills, so to speak, this is a thing. This Guy Jack Kornfield, who I have in my podcast sometimes taught me, this guy's an he's amazing.

Speaker 6:          02:27:08       He's a Buddhist teacher, but he says tend to the part of the garden that you can touch. Right. And I think that is such incredible, incredible instructors agree with. Put it. Yeah, that's a great way to put it. Yeah. So, so it's, it's like in all that chaos that you just described where like you see the thing and you realize like whatever it may be, the thing, the school shooting, the immigration, the bus, that whatever, and you really, you, you, you get this in sad feeling, there's nothing I can do about that. And so you end up online, you're scared. Fear in Buddhism is cold. Anger. Like when fear gets hot, it turns into anger. So you're going to turn, you're going to be angry because you're scared, and then you start firing these shots online in the entire time you're doing that, the entire time you're doing that, your mother who lives at the other, you know, somewhere in the middle of the country is living by herself in a house where she doesn't have enough money and the house is dilapidated and you haven't been paying attention to her.

Speaker 6:          02:28:19       She needs your fucking help, right? It's not time for you necessarily, even though your aspiration to rebalance a democracy is beautiful and we all want that. You're fucking neglecting one of your best friends, not your mom. You know what I'm saying? So someone you know is exhibiting like some fucking behaviors that are like awful little bit or like somebody in your neighborhood or you know, so it's like the whole time your mind through anger is focusing on the fucking press secretary. Who, by the way, Joe, I don't think the press secretary, I could be totally off on this, but you want to talk about shooting the fucking messenger man,

Speaker 1:          02:29:10       that's it. You perfect day when she's the Messenger.

Speaker 6:          02:29:14       Literally. Yeah. You know what I mean like that, that woman like that. That is a messenger like is she. Does she have the most pleasing personality? Do you agree with her politics? Probably not, but like, come on man, I'll tell you this morning, imagine

Speaker 1:          02:29:30       if she didn't have that kind of personality. Imagine if she was cheerful and she went up there and Jim Costa was fucking screaming at her that his name, Acosta, whatever his name is, but that guy gets heckled everywhere he goes. Now they put signs up behind him and say, CNN sucks. There's some really fun things about the trump administration, some really fun things, and one of the fun things is these people that are journalists that takes themselves super serious, are they getting shit on for the first time? I mean, they're getting. They're getting called out for some of their ridiculous behavior, like yelling out questions during the press conference, like your questions more important than all the people around you that might be politely raising their hand. You've decided you need the world needs to know the world needs to know and they get to hold these people, hold their feet to the fire.

Speaker 1:          02:30:14       Okay. Maybe, maybe. Maybe this is not the way to communicate with people ever. Maybe this maxine waters idea of like getting people to protest people in restaurants and build a crowd and let them know that they're not welcome. Okay. Maybe that's the only way, right? Let's just play devil's advocate. If you're looking at all these people that are imposing these immoral policies, separating children from their parents, which seems to be the most egregious. That's the one that bothers us the most. Everyone. Yeah. That's the one that's most horrific. So how Amia bombing them? Yeah, that's crazy. Well, we know that that's far away. That's not here, but how do you stop that? If you just let it happen? These smiling demons just pass these laws and laugh in your face and there's no push back. That doesn't work. So what's the pushback? How do you get push back? This is where it gets weird. They might have a point. Okay. If you're dealing with something that's that disgusting, as long as there's no actual violence. If you're dealing with something that's so heinous, you're separating poor people from their parents. So they're just coming over here trying to take a chance to get a migrant labor ward job and they're trying to pick strawberries or something. And then you have ice come

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       in and steal them from their kids and still their kids from them and yeah, no you don't. You can't come over here. Who are you protecting? Man? Who's who? Who were they competing with to get these fucking strawberry picking jobs? Nobody. This is bullshit, right? How do you stop that from happening while about. What about the law? So in the middle until this log gets changed, we reconsider the humane aspects of this law. How many people's lives are going to get ruined, how many thousands of kids are going to get traumatically separated from their parents and develop to become a more fucked up person who truly resents and hates the United States and get molested. Advice them ice age. Oh Jesus. Could that happen? It did. I'm sure it already happened. I'm sure. I'm not surprised on you want to know the story. It's that, but how would you stop that?

Speaker 5:          02:32:04       I don't know how you would stop that, but one of the only ways that I could think of being really, really effective in getting a message across is to make it super uncomfortable for people that push that message through. Sure. What people that support that policy. People that think it's not a big deal. Cheer. Jeff sessions gave a speech where they made a joke about separating kids from their families and the audience laughed. Pull that. Pull that up. It's on. It was on the cover of every new source today. Here we go. Fucking sessions. But this poor little fuck, it's the same thing with him. Like this guy, he just stopped evolving and he got into this and he's not getting information. He's not getting it. He's not. He's not interacting with people who's not evolving his ideas. He stuck on this. People who smoke marijuana are bad people face some 1930 shit. I know he's a moron. You know, in a lot of ways, and this is the product of his environment. It's a product of his interactions and the ecosystem and that he exists in. He exists in this bubble. Jeff sessions speaking out about separating families

Speaker 9:          02:33:10       from the other side on this issue as on many others has become radicalized. We hear views on television today that are on the lunatic fringe frankly, and what is perhaps more galling is the epoch hypocrisy. These same people live in gated communities, many of them and our featured at events where you have to have an id to even come in and hear him speak. I liked the little security around them ourselves and if you try to scale the fence of, believe me, they'll be even too happy to have you arrested and separated from your children.

Speaker 5:          02:33:49       It seemed like that joke was actually written for him, which is interesting. Says the fucking guy getting people arrested for marijuana. What aloone? Well, you know, obviously fucking dummy. There's a big difference between someone breaking into your house and break it into the country to try to get a job. You're not saying that people should break into people's houses. The main thing is jeff sessions is it represents something in the world and what that thing is is a force that is actively

Speaker 6:          02:34:18       trying to reduce love in the universe and it's fucking rail and so that's the. If you want to come up with a nice war, a name for what's happening. This revolution that's happening and it is, is we're pushing back against that.

Speaker 5:          02:34:36       Okay. Can I be the devil's advocate? I'll be the devil. Yeah, sure. That's not what he's doing. He's supporting the law that we have a law and this is how we keep a beautiful country like America. The reason why we have nice clean streets, the reason why I have cops social security and it's because we have rules and as soon as we just allow people to bypass those rules, people that don't agree with our way of life, don't they? They don't, don't support our way of life. They just want to come over here and Mooch off the system. That's harder for you. It's harder for him. It's harder for everybody else. All Johnny tax payer out there has to pay for these migrants so you don't even know. They're not even a part of your clan from another close by Cloud Jeff. But here's the bigger problem. This is the big problem in. Okay,

Speaker 6:          02:35:17       and you're right. Everything you just said, Mr. sessions too legit to quit. Hey, as far as like the rules of the game and in some ways I guess it's true, but like if we look at it from a bigger perspective, which you type really doesn't like at all for some reason, but maybe it's just because you're old and your body probably hurts a little bit and also that fucking butt plug that I would bet $200,000 that you have shoved into your asshole right now. Think I think all the fucking time and I think it's like, I think I, I get the, I get a big bdsm vibe from that dude, but that's just me. I don't think it's true. I don't know. Here's my point, man. You know, there's a bigger thing happening and that bigger thing is, is, is just, it's for a lot of people it's unpalatable because it's so complex and we don't yet know how to do it, but we live on a planet and you say this all the time where we are all people.

Speaker 6:          02:36:20       We are planetariums, we are earthlings, right? We happen to have been born into a country this country or that country. Some of these countries have big fucking walls around them because there's prosperity inside that country and there's prosperity inside that country and there's not prosperity and other places and people are suffering. They're suffering bad, bad, bad, bad suffering where it's like there, there's like they can't. They can't live in some of these places without getting killed, for sure. The chance of them getting killed as high for whatever reason, and they're just doing what any living organism does. They're trying to get to a better spot. Also, Mr sessions, you probably don't believe in it, but once those fucking ice caps melt, holy fuck. When the cities in the next 50 years or so become inundated with water and people have to start moving more and more and more from places that are becoming uninhabitable.

Speaker 6:          02:37:12       What do you think that's gonna Happen? I don't know man, but let's say it's. Let's put. Let's make a long date. So what do we do Duncan? We just open up the borders for everybody. Mr. Sessions, I don't fucking know, but I can tell you this. If we start approaching this from the perspective of love, which is the perspective of like we don't need to separate them from their kids and there might be a way to do this. That eases their suffering a little bit more. I don't know what it is, but my. From looking at what you're doing right now that a net and I think we can do it better. I don't know what it is, but I think if we get a lot of people together and really think about it and figure it out, I'm not talking redistribution of wealth or some kind of crazy communist shit. I'm just saying I know for sure we can do better than those God damn aluminum blankets you're putting on those fucking kids. Can we get a guitar player in here? Hey, maybe we can get some beds in here. Is there a way to like, you know, there's just all kinds of shit we could do. I think that's better. What am I going to do?

Speaker 1:          02:38:12       Why would that help though? When the people are still gonna come over here. This is going to be in prison. So you play the guitar, is that right?

Speaker 6:          02:38:18       No, I'm not saying play the guitar to solve the immigration problem that worked. I'm sure the immigration problem would be solved. I'm just saying that the current methodology seems to be a little more sadistic than it needs to be. That's all. I don't know the answer. I don't know what the answer is, but I do know we're converging as a species and I would imagine that as technology continues to connect us, we're going to be transcending nationalities in a way that aren't going to be palatable to people like jeff sessions. And I think that that's a, um, that's what's happened.

Speaker 1:          02:38:50       So what do we do now? What would you like? Honestly, like, I'm not jeff sessions anymore on me. Now. Me. Hey dog again. What would you do

Speaker 6:          02:38:59       well for? Okay. I, I'll give you my response to that, which isn't going to be right because I don't really. I don't understand the issue at a level deep enough. Right? So can I just say like one, there's many, there's, it's a complex situation. There's not one answer to it,

Speaker 1:          02:39:16       right? You just let anybody in who's not a criminal,

Speaker 6:          02:39:22       so how do we did it's hard to get in. How do we detect that? Like,

Speaker 1:          02:39:25       yeah, we'd have to have some sort of faith in their records so we would have to help their record keeping. So really what we want to really the way to do it correctly is first of all, anyone is attached to us, whether it's Mexico or Canada, make sure they're okay. Make sure that they are viable and stable and help them. That's the real thing. Treat them as if they're a colony of the United States. They're like, not that they're not sovereign, that there's still Mexico, but like treat them like they are connected to us and we don't want them to be fucked up and crazy set of building up a wall. Make it so that nobody wants to come over here. Like, that seems to be the prosperity way to go about it. Like to say, Hey, you know, Mexico's fucking beautiful. All right. There's a reason why people vacation in Mexico. It's fucking amazing. Okay. You go to Poland, Mita

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       or a fucking Puerto Vallarta or cabo or. Yeah, to loom, there's it's fucking beautiful. The idea that it's beautiful and also dangerous and scary and filled with crime. That's fucking stupid. So then you would go, well, what's the problem here? What's the problem here is drugs. Illegal drugs are illegal in the United States wants to buy a bunch of drugs. So all these people making billions of dollars selling drugs, there's only one way to do that. You've got to kill cops. You got to kill cops, kill rats. You gotta kill rivals. You got to kill whoever the fuck you gotta kill and you've got to send a message. You've got to hang people from fucking bridges and shit. Yeah, you got to do things to send a message that you're ruthless and you're here to get that money and there's a lot of that going on and that is no different than Al Capone during the fucking prohibition of alcohol in the United States of America.

Speaker 5:          02:41:01       It's the same God damned thing. You make something illegal that everybody wants and only criminals are willing to sell it and boom, you got a thriving criminal economy. There you go. And so we're stuck next to a thriving criminal economy with no management of it whatsoever other than bullets, right? So occasionally they throw some bullets into these people and then they come back stronger than ever because there's more drug money and there's less of them. And the one person gets stronger and El Chapo digs a fucking hole, a mile through the ground and gets out of jail again. The whole thing is crazy, but this is what we're next to. And so instead of saying, hey, we got to make a fucking wall and make it. What we should be saying is what do we have to do to not just fix Mexico, not just help them and come up with some sort of strategy and a plan to build them up almost as equals.

Speaker 5:          02:41:44       But we've got to fix our fucking poor neighborhoods. We've got to fix these fucking neighborhoods that had been drenched in poverty since 19 twice. How about fix them? Fix them, put some energy into it. Put some planning, hire people the same way. Halliburton hires people to fucking rebuild shit. We blow up in Iraq. They should be hiring people to figure out how to rebuild these communities, figure out how to give people jobs and figuring out how to develop community center so that kids have somewhere to go there where they can learn and be productive so you're developing less losers, giving people hopes and dreams, giving them things that they can put their energy to that make them feel good about life, right, give them skills and and games they can play and things they could do where they get good at it, where they develop self esteem, which is one of the most terrible things about growing up in an impoverished crime ridden gang infested neighborhood.

Speaker 5:          02:42:31       As you feel like you're nothing. You are nothing. Your life can be taken away at any moment. You got to be careful where you go, but what's a fly and people getting killed. People are killing people over words and insults and fucking territory for drugs and your aunts on crack and your uncles in jail and it's just seems like there's no fucking hope and no one does anything about it. No one doesn't, but few people do things about it. A lot of people dedicate their lives to it, but it's not enough from a governmental level. No one in the top of the organization is looking at this big thing and saying they're all going, hey, we've got to drill more oil. Hey, we got to do with the resources, the resources, the reason. What about our greatest resource human beings? The greatest way to make America great again is to have less losers.

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       The way to have less losers is you've got to find the spots that are sick and healed them. Yes. Yeah. Find these communities that are, that have the momentum of poverty and crime and violence and it's existed for as long as we can think for decades. Fix them, fix them, and have a concerted effort to fix them and do and bring everybody together. Everybody together and instead of this, this idea that we're all separate and we'll just fucking to party, right? Left nonsense is civil war to trump supporters and and, and people want to kick people out of restaurants. How about we all realized that if we're going to treat each other as Americans, we're going to agree that we're on this team. We got to start acting like teammates. That's it. Yeah, so you don't like what the coach is saying. Let's let's find common ground instead of always searching for the negative in things instead of reinforcing ridiculous ideas because you know that that's what your team supports.

Speaker 5:          02:44:06       Like I see a lot of people online talking about this immigrant issue and they either don't have kids or they don't think it could happen to their kids. Their ideas, hey, shouldn't could come over here. You get those broke. The law shouldn't have fucking come over here if you didn't want to get your kid separated. If you were in the presence of a woman who came over here from Guatemala and she's poor and she's starving and they're taking her baby away and she's wailing and screaming from a primal, primal place in her, her DNA that the one thing she loves more than anything is being taken away a baby. Yeah. If you. If that doesn't freak you the fuck out, you're not a part of the team, man, you're missing it. You're missing it. What's, what are we here for? We're here for 100 years of whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:44:50       That's what we're here for. If you want to spend 100 years, say in Earth, broke the law, I don't want you on the team. You're an asshole, right? And I'll give you. I don't give a fuck if you're right or left. I don't care if you're religious or I don't care if you're an atheist, if that's what you support, you are an asshole and we don't want you on our team. Okay? So, but if you agree with certain economic policies that I don't agree with and we could have a discussion about it, we could figure out why you agree and we could figure out why people are allowing all of this money to get into politics. Why are we allowing all these special interest groups and lobbyists to interfere with our laws and influence our, our, our politicians, and create all this shit that we don't want?

Speaker 5:          02:45:31       Well, here's the number one reason. You can't just vote online, you can't just vote one person, one vote. It's the electoral college and there's a lot of checks and balances that are in place. That's all wonderful and groovy, but it's not giving the trust to the people, trusted the people that are. They're informed that they could make their own decisions, that more people should be able to make the decision, but they're happening now that 28 year old girl who who a 28 year old debt democratic socialists, whether I agree with her or not and I don't know if I do or don't. I bet I agree with her on a lot of things. I think education should be free. I think we should figure out a way. If we could pay for bombs, we could pay for schools. I think that this idea that everybody should have healthcare.

Speaker 5:          02:46:09       It's a great idea. Who the fuck wants people to not be healthy? Who wants people to be hurt and not be able to fix it? Who wants to do? Are you really saying that struggling people should have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to get fixed when we could maybe chip in and help members of our team, that stupid paper, fill it out, figure it out yourself on how to. You got lucky bitch. You got lucky. You don't have leukemia. You didn't break both your legs. When you're 18, your parents are dead. You got lucky piece of shit. Yeah. These are people on our team is. I'm not talking about people who are lazy, good for nothing. Losers mooching off the system. You're going to have that too. Where we got to figure out how to educate people so that that happens less and less.

Speaker 5:          02:46:46       That's what we got to figure out how to do. That's it you just described. I mean that is it. I don't know what to call that thing you just talked about, but like that's happening everywhere. That's not just happening in the United States. That's a global shift that's happening. Have you. Did you see the video when she found out she won this amazing put play it. It's like one of the rear realist moments and look, people are angry. Twenty eight year olds. What the fuck does she know what she doesn't know? She'll learn 20, like, yeah, that's fine. Let's find out what she learns. Maybe she maybe she knows a lot. I liked the fact she wasn't supposed to win. I like the fact that the guy who was an incumbent was a 10 term and come back and that he spent 10 to one verse on her. Then how much money she spent 10 to one in grassroots grassroots elected man. And that's how this. That's it. That can happen too. She's a kid. Yeah, she's pretty. She's a pretty young, 28 year old. I mean watch this, watch this shit. When she wins, plays it.

Speaker 7:          02:47:45       How are you feeling? Can you put it into words? You know, I don't know if Democratic craddick

Speaker 5:          02:47:57       socialism is the answer, but I know it's a part of the conversation. Yep. And this is the thing that locking out any ideology in this team as part of the conversation, like what is democratic socialism entail? Like what does it entail? I'm, I don't. I don't buy all this. The market will take care. It's care of itself. Bullshit. I think there's a certain amount of us we have to chip in to the community pile. Yeah, Shit. That's real. The real problem is how efficient and good is the community pile or the. A bunch of lazy constantly community pile are there. Is there waste to nonsense and bullshit? These people that have those jobs you were talking about earlier that told slow down, slow down. I know you could do this in two hours, but you can get an eight hour day out of this. Don't fuck this up.

Speaker 5:          02:48:38       How much of that's going on? I don't want any of that going right? But if the community pile is taking care of it and, and managed in a, in a, uh, an honest and a way that's trustworthy and great for all involved and beneficial to the community and, and supportive of community values and love and this idea that we're all on a team and that you're going to be okay. Did you break your leg, Duncan? Hey, you're going to be okay and we make fun of Canada's healthcare. And it's not the best, it's the best. I have friends, my friend Jen, she broke her fucking knee. She had to get a acl reconstruction. They kind of botched it and they had to go back in and fix it again. She had to wait forever. It's not the best, but it's there. It's something and it maybe that can be improved.

Speaker 5:          02:49:20       I may be improving. That is better. Let me throw this in. So have options. But I also believe in options for people to do it better. Like the surgeons that you can get in the United States. Like there's a guy Dr Getelman to go fix my knee. He's a fucking wizard. This guy's really got good. He does a lot of pro athletes. I mean he did a great fucking job reconstructing my knee. He's an artist. I don't think there's anything wrong with someone like that getting paid more. I don't think if someone was like, I think Lebron James should get paid more for playing basketball than me. If I was playing basketball, I shouldn't. You pay as much as she's fucking way better. Right? Yeah. And I think that there's, there's that with doctors as well, I think with everything as well, but I think that it's a lot like there's a lot of people that are, um, a state funded prosecutors or, or a defense attorneys, you know, where, where the people can't afford it.

Speaker 5:          02:50:08       Uh, you know, you get, what is that called? What's the offender? Public public defender, yeah. There's a lot of people that are really good, really good, really young, hungry, very good at it. They just, they're, they're going to put in their time in the public sector or doing it for, for the public public defender. And then they eventually go onto maybe, maybe even not do that. Maybe they just did. They get satisfaction out of helping people that don't have any money. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't have high priced lawyers as well. And it doesn't mean that people shouldn't be able to pursue excellence and be rewarded for that excellence and be able to do whatever the fuck they want with it. Whether they want to be charitable with that money or where they want to be selfish with that money. If they're pursuing excellence and through their excellence they did.

Speaker 5:          02:50:49       They managed to amass an extreme amount of wealth doing playing the guitar, whatever the fuck they do. There's nothing wrong with that either. We've got to stop thinking there's something wrong with that, but chipping in and everybody putting into the company, pop is in a sense some form of socialism, right? Like we agree on some kind of socialism like is when you consider like the fire department, the police department. It's just like social things, right? We put money into it. It's not a total redistribution of wealth like deciding how much rich people should pay, but it is deciding you got to chip in. We all got to chip in. Everybody's got a chip. I just don't feel like the chip and in is good. We feel like it's all fucked up. We feel like there's a bunch of dummies out there like this jeff sessions guy.

Speaker 5:          02:51:31       That guy gets paid for my chip. This fucking dummy and all these fucking people that are robbing the system with their two hour a day jobs that they're stretching out to eight hours. That builds resentment. It's poor management and it's also people that are listless and they have these. They're not valuable jobs and not like a job that commands the same sort of attention is like some of the more attractive jobs that people seek out. Yeah, man, I, I. it's all of it's true. I just think it's, it's the what people think is let's wait for the government to do this

Speaker 2:          02:52:07       and that's where I think the problem is like instead of thinking like, okay, yeah, all that's true. Let's like figure out a way to get more taxpayer money out of the military industrial complex out of the prisons. It, let's put it in the neighborhoods that need it. Let's get it for funding education, all of that is really beautiful, but when it's still in and you want to vote and make all that happen, grassroots movements, all of it, but also think of the term socialism, right? Just what is it? Social. It's like you don't have to wait for the state to come and start figuring out ways to tax people to make that pile of money happened. Like this is. This is where I think it's an interesting thing to start exploring the idea of intentional communities. I'm not saying starting a commune or anything like that, but you can actually push your friendship group to the next level.

Speaker 2:          02:53:04       Like it doesn't just have to be a random group of friends who knows each other. Like you can start that pile of opulence with a group of friends where it's like, you know what I mean? A group of friends can just agree with each other like, hey man, just so you know, you're not going to be homeless. I got you. I'm not going to fucking give you money all the Goddamn time. And if you like, you know, if you're like, you don't even have to say any of this shit except hey, we're. This is always okay. You're okay. You're okay. Gotcha. Right. That's what you and I did when you moved in with Joe. I know man, and I forget about that sometimes. We lived together for like six months. I don't forget about it. And, and, and the, the, the, um, that kind of thing, which is what I'm saying is like everyone right now and, and I understand why I'm in, but to me there seems to be something demonic about the public fixation on the state. It's the state. Is this like dragon and it's like got like, it's a. well, I think it's a daddy. It's a daddy. It's a multi-arm daddy with a bunch of fucking laser pointers that it's got the entire population watching like cats running around. Right, right.

Speaker 7:          02:54:19       God, they did that. Oh my God, he did that. Oh my God, they did that. When will this change? When will this change

Speaker 2:          02:54:25       your phone's ringing gas. Who's fucking calling your dad? When was the last time you talked to your dad? Three months ago. Call Your fucking dad back the whole time you were like,

Speaker 7:          02:54:36       God, yeah. Did Dr Dre

Speaker 2:          02:54:38       the whole time you're neglecting your family. You're neglecting your neighborhood. You're walking down the street looking at your phone like, holy fuck. He said that. Oh, I'm writing a fucking blog about that. Guess what, you're walking by dude, you're walking by fucking plastic bottles, piles of fucking trash, three fucking mathematics in some fucking woman who just got beaten by her husband is now living on the streets

Speaker 6:          02:55:04       for the last couple of weeks and you've got fucking $40,000 in the bank account. Liquid. And when I say that to the garden you can touch. Yes, yes. Tend to the garden. You can touch and do it in an organized way and then like maybe a, but don't you have a garden that you can touch this giant or you think about that. Think about what you've done during this podcast and some of the things that you've said. You basically touched an enormous garden. Sure. That, that's, that's, that's one. That's a really easy way to do it because I'm a Yappy motherfucker. I'm talking about like, no in your life too, but that counts too. I think it does count, but I think that it's, it would be easy to do things like that and, and, and still forget about something that's really basic, which is now that I'm talking about that shit, I'm thinking to myself right now, like in my neighborhood, I'm thinking like, wait a minute, wait, what am I not doing?

Speaker 6:          02:56:01       I don't know what it is yet, but I guarantee you there's something that I could do. And, and I liked that man because he knew like tithing to the church. Yes. So to me that I think we may have talked about this before but I get it and all but like it always seemed like a really boring way to do it. Like the plate comes by, you throw some money and you don't. It goes to church stuff you don't know. But the idea of tithing, I think there's something to it which is like if you just kind of look at your income and you think, all right, five percent of this shit is gonna get spent or 10 percent or whatever you're comfortable with. I'm putting that in a pile and that pile is going to helping people in my neighborhood or my friends or my family and I'm just going to give that away.

Speaker 6:          02:56:52       And um, I think there's something to be said for that because right now I think we were a little too fixated on the daddy state helping us and I think it's more important that we start helping each other and forming communities with that are based on love and friendship and just figure it out. Some of the communities are going to fail, some of them are going to get a couple of assholes in there who are con artists and trick. Everybody are lazy people. But the main thing is, is like let's start thinking in terms of organizing into communities that aren't based on a fixation on the government right now. And then let's see what happens. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we conclude another episode of the Joe Rogan experience. I'd like to thank my guests, Duncan Trussell, Duncan Trussell, praise Odin, Heidi young, Jamie on the mic and the work of the keys in the background. And all of you folks love you, love for everybody. We can do this, folks. We doing it. We're doing this. We're going to be okay. Bye.
