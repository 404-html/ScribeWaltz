Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. I also don't know if life can actually evolve and progress just through pure logic or pure rationality. I think chance is very important in life and I also think being creative and creative must to some extent involved. That ridiculousness at least must involve the question of asking why now it might get more logical and rational as we go forward, but I'm not sure we're ever going to completely be the perfect mathematical model that we would want to be A. I'm not even sure that if we had perfect intelligence, if let's just say hypothetically we became that perfect intelligence. We might purposely sabotage ourselves just so that we always have that element of irrationality in our lives to keep us on the go, to keep us moving forward, to keep us evolving. So I'm. So that's the first part of that. I think the second part of what you're speaking about, the the interesting thing that I always tell people, because I get asked this question a lot, is that right now our current perception of the universe is pretty limited.

Speaker 1:          01:00          For example, our ISI can only see about one percent of the light spectrum. Our ears can hear far less than one percent of the of the sound waves and what's possible in the universe, so our actual ability to determine what is in the universe is completely limited, in fact, so limited that were were just basically getting tiny bits of it. As we get, as we progress forward, I think we're going to have apps, a more applications towards getting a better perception and our senses of what the universe really entails. We'll all have night vision will have be able to see different types of gases in the air and we'll we'll have different types of feelings that are based in with with this, these kind of a hypersensitive and that in itself will give us so many new experiences and I try to tell this to people a lot that we're actually going to become much more complex.

Speaker 1:          01:50          We think this is our world around us, but actually if you and I had bionic eyes, we'd see that there are maybe a billion different organisms in this room that are also interacting with us. And that's something that, I'm not saying it's gonna maybe take us down a, either a smart or a bad path, but it's something that could be different, that could take us to other ideas and other ways of experiencing the world that makes it so it's not either boring or makes it so it's not. So, you know, so kinda crazy though. I, you know, I, I don't think that humans are ever gonna end transhumans at least to start with are going to give up some of the ridiculous aspects of their life because I'm. One of the things that motivates us is fun and one of the things in, in human experience that is fun is being ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          02:35          So I think you need that creativity. You need that creative element in the species. I think that most I've ever done was I think $10,000 to some corporate event. It wasn't. People showed up to see me. I was a Sammy Hagar was on and Steve Miller, I was on. Wow. You worked a Sammy Hagar and Steve. But what does Steve Miller looked like? Did you even recognize them? A. No, because the album was the white horse lake, so my whole teenage years of listened to. I've never saw what he looked like. He looked like a dad with a blazer and jeans and just went out there. That's the thing about Steve Miller. He is the least recognizable major. He walk around Rockstar. He could walk around anywhere and it seemed like he never tried to become famous or you're going to out him on the podcast that Steve Miller. That's what it looks like now.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Dude. He had some fucking jams. Jungalow love that was high school. That whole album reminds me of high school. Take the money alone. This is a story about Billy Joe. We thought we thought we were cool too because we're listening to classic rock. That was technically they were into this stuff, not this new edition. You know? It's really fucking weird, man. I went to high school in 1981 and in 1981 I started hanging out with these kids. I just moved into town into a Newton upper falls and I started hanging out with my friend Jimmy and Jimmy and all of his friends were all, uh, from the other side of town there. They're all like the north part of Newton and they were all like, everyone had doors, tee shirts and they were all smoking weed and it was like they introduced me to all this music that I didn't even know existed.

Speaker 1:          04:14          But when I think about it now, the shit was only 10 years old. Yeah. Like the allman brothers, they were, they were playing like some allman brothers are some doors. That shit is from like 1969, 1970. So at the time we're talking wwe, I went to high school in [inaudible] 81. That was my freshman year. So this is, what is it, 12, 13 years old as fuck. Nothing. That's like some music from 2001 that's contemporary, you know, like a song from 2002. You could still hear like on a regular basis that would be on a radio station that was eighties, nineties and hits sex and can. Yeah, you can hear that. You could easily hear that someone could play that non. Ironically on a regular radio station, they wouldn't be saying, oh, you remember this shit. That would be a song that would play, but that sex and candy song came out and like, like 99 or some shit.

Speaker 1:          05:04          Yeah. So think about that. Like that. We wouldn't say, yeah man, that was the classic. Something fucking happened to time, right? Time is not what it used to be 10 years ago doesn't mean shit anymore, but 10 years ago back then meant a lot when I was in high school and then in 1981 and 1970 car was a mother fucker. If you had a 1970 Chevelle or a 1970 barracuda, you add a fucking sweet car. Oh, you got a classic muscle car. It's only 10 years old. What the fuck happened? And he does that when it happened. The acceleration, just information. We're pumped. We're going to the library every single second. We look at her phone, you know, that's what's happening, right? That is what's happening. That's deep. It's cleaned my bedroom the other day and I have a pretty big bed, but underneath the bed it's

Speaker 2:          05:58          like in the middle you'll never get anything on, you know, like if something falls under the bed. So I was trying to get everything and I pulled out a single cheeseburger from Mcdonald's that I guess I was eating and I like threw, threw it on the ground or something and it just went in there and get it to you. I know you live like I haven't had mcdonalds in my bed for at least six months and so that. But when I opened it, it looked brand new. It looked just exactly the same. You would buy it at perfect apartments, like the raft of a survivor's stranded at sea. It's just scattered disarray with bobbers and nets and one shoe pirate in the corner for some reason. Yeah. That big area in the middle where you can reach under your bed area is a problem. It's disgusting because if you ever do move your bed, your bed, you're like looking at it going, that's so gross.

Speaker 2:          06:50          How much would I have to pay you to lick that center area where you can't reach? Just do the whole line on the line from the head to the. Keep your tongue down on the ground from the foot of the bed to the head of the bed. Like an Imac could only take an imac to get you to do that. Hello? Yeah. Wow. What about Ipad mini? I licked. I licked the bowl. I licked the stripper pole at a crazy girl is a couple of months ago on stage because we were doing comedy there and I just said some hot girl just got off and I was like, damn, that girl is hot. And I just like licked it as a joke. Everyone was like, oh, but then I thought about it and then I had like a canker on my time for like three days. Welcome to the wonderful world of new AIDS canker on your dog. I was freaked out for a couple of days, but it was so hilarious. That is so hilarious. David Arquette owns that place now and I told him like he would. He did kill Tony and I told him about that. You just give me a high five. He's like, that's great. That's hilarious. He owns a strip club. What a good move for a fucking celebrity that's just getting divorced.

Speaker 2:          08:00          What an excellent move and that places a. They do comedy occasionally there. Yeah, they do. Shows are like music sometimes and that it's totally not set up for comedy though because they have like a strobe light facing the comic. So you're onstage and you're just having elliptic caesars and you can't see anything. Pick seizures, whatever. Elliptical seizures. Epileptic you fuck wrong ellipses.
