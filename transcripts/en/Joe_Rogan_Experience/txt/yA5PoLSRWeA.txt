Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. So that's a massive sacrifice you're willing to take to be, to do that. And this, the fact that it's exists inside your body for an undetermined state of time. That's um, that's pretty wild, man. It's, it's scary. Um, yeah. Honestly I feel like I was in a much scarier place personally, um, before, before I found this before I found them before I got given a second family or accepted into a second family and more scarier because you were depressed because he just will depress suicidal thoughts. I had for like 10 years, just battle it from 13 years old, 23 and so, um, yeah, that, that was a lot scarier to me than going home to his huddle thoughts when you're 13. Yeah, for sure. And I, I mean, I was, I was the one that like, you know, the kid in the, in the class that, I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't like, I wouldn't say I was, how do I say?

Speaker 1:          01:03          It was extremely brutal, but it was happening to, I mean, everyone gets bullied for the most part. Um, somebody who's bullying you. Yeah. Well when I was growing up that from from third grade until eighth grade for sure it was brutal. 70 Dalton usually smaller than I was here. Dude, I was smaller. It takes a lot of balls to bully you. Yeah. And my backfire, it's actually kind of why I found fighting or net. Why or it is kind. It is because uh, I was 13 years old and I had just gotten so, well two things. Have you ever seen in Texas for high school homecomings? They have mums, have you heard of that? No. It's a mom is tradition. That's crazy. Um, now all, all, all the kids love him, everything else. But you get these like Chris Hodges or fake flowers that they put real big up top and then they are streamers with literal bells and whistles, full size teddy bears.

Speaker 1:          02:00          You can have two, three teddy bears. And when I was in high school, the girl would wear it on her shoulder and the guy would weird round his arm. Now in Texas, they literally have to put a harness around them and hold these things up because they're so big. And there you go. Mom texted him on Fox. That's homecoming in Texas. Why? Look at that. I'm telling you it's an example. State the whole state. I mean every heard of the every homecoming that comes around tech Texans are nuts about this. I mean I lived in Texas and I was like four months old, so it was a there nuts in, they've gotten bigger and bigger and bigger every single year. And uh, how am I just hearing about the proud of it? It's weird. I mean I I you just hearing about this Jamie, I think those are literally like two and $300.

Speaker 1:          02:41          No, not, yeah. When I was in high school they were like 7,000 all my God, look at all those girls. Look at that picture that you had done there. There's a giant group of girls with all this. This is ridiculous. That not nuts. How do you, how do you go to the dance like that? How do you go to the game like that? I don't understand. I mean literally the boyfriends are walking behind him, holding the stuff up for him because what the, it's getting too heavy or their neck hurts, but they want to wear it. It's a tradition. Yeah. Everybody gets excited. The bigger and the bigger the mum, the better. The more, the more your date. Like do you, is this a mum company that you just clicked on every single grocery store in Texas? Whenever it comes to like a September, October, November, around homecoming time, high school, like this is people's jobs, like seasonal jobs.

Speaker 1:          03:26          He sit around and they take special orders. They make them for you or they sound where he can make them yourself. Um, that's so strange, isn't it nuts? How many is this? It always baffles me when I find out about something for the very first time. I don't know why I'm so confused. I would like to find out where the tradition came from probably. But I mean, people, it's just so ingrained in you. If you're texting, they have to get moms. And so, uh, is there any other states? Find out if other states except that I literally the Oklahoma doesn't do it. Louisiana doesn't New Mexico, I mean times 12 things non Texas need to know about homecoming moms. Uh, what in the fuck mom started as a simple flower. Hold on, scroll up a little bit. Mum started as a simple flower guys, give them to their homecoming date.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Oh that's hilarious. Girls also give guys one called a garter. Like a garter. Oh, they put it on your, on your arm when garter belt on over your side. How buzz. Like one of those things that Thai boxing where yeah, being able to make moms can make you rich. Oh God. See 60 to $300. What? $300 for fake flowers on her bucks. It ain't cheap to electrify a mom. Oh my God. That chick's got home and lights up. That's so crazy. You could put led lighting. Look at that scroll and Scroll up a little bit, but you can put led lighting and mum's, I didn't know how many folks are doing this back when I was in high school, but nowadays you really want to impress your date, the latest and mum lighting technology will help you do just that. That is hilarious. You know, this isn't even like a joke website right now. Was a cereal to taking it serious. So strange. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:09          it's really weird. And so when I was in middle school, seventh grade, I, you know, look at that girl, she's got a Christmas tree on her tits. That's ridiculous. They, uh, so you want to save, I saved it up and my allowance asked one of my crushes to go to the homecoming game with me. She said yes, to my surprise, I went to the game and, uh, spent pretty much all my allowance on, uh, the her mom and, uh, her name's Jessica and I took her to the game and I'm up in the stands with her and home or halftime comes around, I'm up to the very top left and all of a sudden everyone looks back up over the right shoulders at us. And this one guy, he's kind of my, my belief through elementary and middle school for sure. And um, his name was justin as well.

Speaker 1:          06:01          And so he walks up and puts his arm out to her and she puts her arm around his and he grabs the streamer that says, uh, Justin and Jessica and a year on it or whatever. And uh, he says, thanks for getting her this. And I'm like, what? And he goes, you didn't think she'd come with you, did you? And so he just kind of walks down. All the schools, look in, they're all laughing and having fun, but, and that one hurt, but what was worse with the next year? Cause you know, people liked that part of, I don't know, I think for me, when I see bullying now, I just spoke at a middle school and I told one of the teachers asked, what should you tell a kid that's battling with suicidal thoughts or depression, even maybe suicidal thoughts. And I'm like, well, if this is 300, 400 kids in here, like for sure one person is dealing with these issues right now.

Speaker 1:          06:53          And I would say, you know, um, the thing that probably saved me was my parents didn't own a gun. I'd probably only Texans that don't own guns. And uh, then, um, I don't know. I mean, I guess one of the main things was, um, well I don't even know that I've ever said this publicly, but I remember, um, uh, having attempted suicide once and then I'm thinking about it again and then I'm thinking, you know, what would this, what would this do to my mom? You know? And so I love my Mama. My Mama's boy, dad's great too, but that's just who I am. She's a tough cookie. She's where I got my competitiveness. She was a national champion and barrel racing state champion in tennis. And so she always pushed me, my dad, if he, uh, if he was at a wrestling tournament and it's the finals even state, I would dislocate my thumb or something, he'd come up, you don't have to wrestle in the next match.

Speaker 1:          07:46          Like it's the finals. My Mom's like, he's getting out there. So my mom's the one pushing him to shut up. Jimmy. He's gonna, he's gonna go out there and he's going to wrestle. He's going to win. And so, uh, my dad was more of the, the one who need to protect me and she's the one wanting to push me out there. Um, so I guess, uh, I mean, all I'm saying that except for, oh, that thought was just ringing in my head. And so whenever I finally verbalized that and start talking to people, that's what really helped. You know, it didn't have to be a bunch of people. I didn't have to go around and be, um, I don't know, a drama queen or do it for attention or whatever, but just find one person. And for me at that age, it was having a great mom and um, and parents that love me.

Speaker 1:          08:25          And I think that's probably absolutely what saved me at that time. And so I was telling these kids, you know, hey, tell if, even if it's just your mom. So I was taking pictures with some of the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll walk out to leave and I'm in the hall and this mom stops me because she's with her little guy and he's crying. So a mom had come to school and heard there was anti bullying talk. She came up and I see this little guy and reminded me, a lot of me, the only difference was, uh, was he had these kind of big glasses on, but he was a little chubby and had just had one of those things that you'd see stereotypical like this kid's going to get picked on. And so I'm probably a lot like me. He's used to getting his fat, pinch tune nipples twisted and you know, all that different stuff.

Speaker 1:          09:10          And so, um, he was out there just bawling with his mom as Paul. Massive. I come talk to them for a little bit. I did. And she was saying that he had never opened up with her and uh, in the last two years, but she knew he had been dealing with really bad depression. And right there he told her, I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for two years. And so I don't know why I even brought that up except for like, it's nuts. My parents have a, have a photography company and they meet a memorial a few years back for a little boy. He was getting bullied, didn't think he had an option out. And he took his life at nine years old. Oh my God. When I think it was a swing set out back, so himself, Jesus Christ. And so, um, and I saw the plaque and everything made up for him and just gut wrenching.

Speaker 1:          09:57          And so anyway, I say that in the first story it wasn't that, but from this kind of one that kind of brought everything to a head was I was in middle eighth grade this time, um, got invited to a Jennifer's, um, birthday party. Really excited. Got The one of the real limitations in my hands and, um, made the plan stuck to my mom, asked if I could go and talk to some of the people who else is going. That was kind of Dorky kid anyways, but, um, uh, on the invitation, I know that man, it says costume contest and the winner gets a prize. Why started in research, all this other stuff, other people are doing it too. And um, I found out that her dad worked at Dr Pepper, um, in that their house was decorated with it, all this other stuff. And then, um, and then the, she loved transformers.

Speaker 1:          10:45          And so I thought, what if I combine those two things? What if I could, uh, meet myself a cardboard transformer from head to toe? Uh, I think it was a 24 pack or on the head, 12 packs around the arms, legs, boots. I had, I had a chest plate at a sword out of a cardboard, a country kid texted, you see those moms? We can do pretty much anything with duct tape. And, uh, so duct tape, cardboard just made it up and walked into the party and, um, her grandma opened the door and she goes, oh, Jennifer's going to love this. Walked into, they literally had a Dr Pepper machine where it was like old school ones you'd have to pay, just push the button. It pops out. 13 year old kid. You love that. So we got Dr Pepper. Can one hand have the Dr Pepper Cardboard Sword in the other walk to the backyard.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Um, when whenever the door opens, I opened the door and breathe there with like some flashes of lights and fingers pointing people laughing. And um, I remember Jennifer saying, I can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party. And I was the only one that was dressed up. Everybody else had gotten there early and they all been planning and even the invitations were fake just so that I would come there, dress up at another kid, said, um, you're worthless. So in that moment it felt worthless. And then, um, the main belief said you should just kill yourself. And so whenever he said that 13 years old battle with depression and suicidal thoughts, all the different stuff in it, it took me on a downward spiral tailspin. Um, it really sucked. I didn't know how to cover it up. And then I guess I'm getting back to them and may route where I found that 13 years old at like a flea market in Texas and walking down these aisles and looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden get to the site used video shop and it's got UFC vhs.

Speaker 1:          12:24          I think it was two through 10 or 10, two through 11 or something like that. And I'm so I just, my bottom wall, um, you were on there and a is a horrible story, man. That is a terrible story. How the fuck does kids be so mean? I mean, I thought he's, honestly, I, I don't think it's, I mean that crazy compared to, I mean it is, it's very like a methodical, like very planned out and a lot of people were in on it. I think that probably was one of the things like, honestly, Jennifer was that the biggest crush I ever had and you know, elementary, middle school growing up, you know, and so she was the one that really wanted to impress. That's why I did that research, you know, and then to know that she was in on it, these other guys planned it, but she went along with it, um, to her to have her say that to you, like the, I can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party.

Speaker 1:          13:16          Yeah. Fuck man. Yeah. I ended up leaving. Um, and this is before cell phones. Uh, and I didn't have a cell phone until I was like 16 and 17, and I'm, so I'm 13 run out, found a dairy queen and uh, went in the back and where the drive through is there was like a, I don't know, the dumpster and they got like the fence around it and I just was able to open it, sit there and just cried basically until, uh, so when we came out to throw away the trash and then they were like, oh, how many got down and what do you need? And all this other stuff. Can you call your mom? I'm like, if I have a phone. And so I walked inside, called her, but she wasn't there. So it took a little while to get ahold of my mom.

Speaker 1:          14:00          And then, um, yeah, I mean it was just, it was nuts because, um, it's weird how you, you'll believe, especially in today's age with social media and all the tweets and things that people just throw away. I throw around, um, you know, it's nuts how you can see something. We don't even know him. They might have one follower, but somehow it can still, if you let it, it can still affect you instead of just shrugging it off. That's a totally different thing though. So saying something on twitter and someone saying something and looking you in the eyes. Yeah. And planning out this big deception. Yeah. But you're such a nice guy. Like I don't understand what, what the fuck causes someone to be such a shit head like that? Well, I don't know man. I think, well, I think, um, I've, I've matured a lot where, I mean obviously 29 said 13, but, uh, uh, I think I just became an easy target and because he's a nice guy and they just, maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and maybe I wasn't the biggest kid, but I was Chubby and bigger and, uh, uh, yeah, I think it just was easy to pick on me in the locker rooms.

Speaker 1:          15:08          Pick on me. And the, I don't know. I think, I think the stats I was looking at with something like 87% of bullying doesn't happen in the presence of, um, adults, adults. Right. And then, uh, I forget, but you know, even the people around like how you're saying, you know, if to people plan it out and everything else, look in the eyes. I mean I think that might've been what took me back the most because I was like, man, like this is, if you're sitting by that, this is what I tried to tell some of the kiddos grown up. Now it's like if you think that by laughing I'm, if you're there and you're not bullying but you're giggling, you're laughing. Like you're definitely a part of it. You're an encourager. But then if you're, even if you're silent and you're just watching it and you don't, like now your, if you see it, you have a choice, you can do something about it.

Speaker 1:          15:55          You can not. And so I feel like that's a passive standby kind of encouragement where it, and so for me it was like everyone was there, people were saying it, people were laughing, people were watching, but nobody was standing up for me. So it was a definitely, that's what hurt the most. We'll see. So there's two giants says the one with the other guy named Justin. So they plan that out to fuck man. Yeah. Both kids. Yeah. It was actually part of the same kids, so yeah. Damn. Yeah. And then, uh, so from that, um, yeah, that, that's, that's definitely been the biggest battle of my life has been depression, suicidal thoughts. And it was all from that bullying. There was nothing other than that for the depression. I mean, it went from, technically I would say it went from third grade to 10th grade.

Speaker 1:          16:49          And then whenever I started wrestling and my parents transferred me out of the school, everything else then, but the bullying is what caused all these suicidal thoughts. There's nothing else that was bumming you out about life that is so fucked up at some shitty mean kids can all of a sudden throw this monkey wrench in your life. And then I've, I've learned, and I mean, of course I, uh, you know, a lot. I used to looking back, I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have ever let it get to the point to where you know, I think I should hurt myself or kill me. You know what, just a real quick put that together with the pygmies and Congo, whenever I opened up and shared with some of them around the campfire, just hanging out, talking, sharing life stories. I shared that and I just remember the looks on several people's faces just so baffled.

Speaker 1:          17:39          Like did he just say he wanted to hurt himself, he was suicide. He wanted to kill himself. I'll let him and stuff. And then my sister asking me, does that not happen here? And they're like, whoa. There's of them were like, well we've heard of that happening before and yeah, there's, there's this guy that was that guy and that guy and that guy and we heard that someone in their village had hurt themselves or kill themselves or something. But most of the people I think were like, no, never heard. Why would anyone, if you hurt yourself, you're only like, it's only hurting you. Right. That's not going to help anything. But you just want the pain yet. Yeah, yeah. Here I just wanted the pain to end. But there it's like, it's nuts because they, if I look at it, I was a little kid.

Speaker 1:          18:17          I got bullied by some, some stupid kids, and then look at, if I look at what they're going through me and it makes it, it makes it, it shrinks it, it makes it microscopic. Whenever you stop just focusing on your own problems and you start looking at others, other problems that maybe you can be a part of helping solve that problem. So, so this bullying all throughout your childhood led into adulthood and the only thing that made it better was you go into the Congo and helping out these pygmies and building wells and, and sort of dedicating and devoting your life to their life. Yeah, I would say practically, um, that has been, you know, to have a sense of purpose. I mean, I think it's a, it's a lot of different things, but that all kind of came together. But for me. Yeah. I mean, when you're not living for yourself and you live in for others, you just want, I mean, I didn't know that for me, I had a big paradigm shift or change in my life whenever, you know, coming out of the addiction, I felt like, I mean like I don't have to walk around and hate myself and stay away from people because they either going to hurt me or I'm going to want to hurt them.

Speaker 1:          19:31          Like, uh, I don't have to do that. I can, I can help people. I can want to love him. I can, you know, figure out something that I did at first started at what really started helping a lot, was involved with a lot of different stuff from a juvenile detention center. Going into meeting with some of those kids once a week to a homeless shelter, to becoming a official volunteer at the Denver Children's hospital and taking the grudge guys through there. And did, do you stay in any way in touch with those kids from back in the day from the kids who bullied you? Did you ever, it was actually funny, after the ultimate fighter, um, I got invited out by one of the guys, um, and, uh, just because I think a couple of people, they'll just, yeah, it's all one of the guys who was one of the main guys and he's like, Hey, I just saw him walking around downtown Fort Worth.

Speaker 1:          20:23          And he said, why don't we go out here? Whatever. I'm like, all right, I'll go. And, well, he had actually, uh, brought me into, uh, the Sushi restaurant in all around the table was most of the people that were not most, it's probably only eight or 10 people, but they were some of the main kids that were at that party when I dressed up and everything. Why? Man, if you, if we had known you were a fighter or you can kick their butts and we wouldn't have done that to you. And I'm just like it. So I told him I was going to bathroom, just left, um, from, I think that's the only time I've ever done anything like that, but I'm just like, I can't, can't be around these guys. Did. Did you, did you sense any feeling of remorse from them or they just want to be friends?

Speaker 1:          21:01          One new one or two of them? Uh, one guy for sure. He's, he's, he's pretty cool now and um, but then one is a, is a knuckle head for sure and still, yeah. Picked up. You know, it's that classic thing of kids ganging up on one kid. That's a weird instinct that sometimes children have. You remember that movie carry on? They uh, she goes to the prom and the sea. Did you ever say Shanti's basic moving? It's based on a great Stephen King Book. I knew that the cover, the, the sissies basic movie was really trippy. Uh, John Travolta's in it. Hmm. Bagging the de young and handsome. Um, but it's, you know, that's the themes that they push her. She has these crazy telekinetic powers and they push her to this point and they do it by mocking her and bullying her. They take her to the prom, they pour pig's blood on our hedge, which winds up killing everybody.

Speaker 1:          21:55          Oh Wow. Yeah. It was pretty, pretty crazy. But that's that thing that happens when kids gang up on a kid that they feel like is vulnerable. Like what the fuck is that man? What a horrible instinct take. Is that, what do I mean? I, I just, I struggle to understand where that instinct comes from or why people do it. It's um, especially little kids. No, I mean I, I guess I can understand that if the kids have been abused themselves and they want to lash out there angry and hurt, but oftentimes it's just they find someone who's a vulnerable, it's like they find the pecking order and they find the one person that can get away with them. They all funneled their insecurities and their anger and their aggression on this one person just because think with no regard whatsoever, what kind of impact it's going to have on that kid. Yeah. I think, I think one of the things that makes it so much worse now is elite. I mean, I don't know. I get to hear some of the stuff and they can't escape it. Like, you know, cause it follows him home. I know that cyber bullying and they get the text and the, all that stuff is so, it's constantly, so I could at least escape it from eight to three, eight to three. I was at school, but when I came home, I was, I was okay. And, um, maybe that gave me a break.

Speaker 2:          23:14          [inaudible] yeah.
