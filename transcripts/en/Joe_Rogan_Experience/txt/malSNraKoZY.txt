Speaker 1:          00:08          I think it comes down to equality, um, which is I think such a silly thing to say in 2008, um, but I think it comes down to sort of civil rights, the right to get married, the right to file your taxes together, hospital visitation rights, um, and, and I think beyond that is equality including in the military with don't ask, don't tell, which seems to always be a hot button issue that pops up, uh, you know, once a year or so, but especially now with the presidential debate, uh, and uh, candidates taking a aside on the issue. Um, but I, I think it comes down to basic civil rights

Speaker 1:          00:54          because I think it remains even among people who claim to support gay rights. I think it remains a taboo subject in that while if we're saying the majority of America has no problem with gay people, I think that there's an asterisk that position no problem with gay people so long as you're not my son as long as you're not my sister. Um, and I, and I think the idea of introducing that and into one's personal life, um, whether people will own up to it or not remains an issue. I think it's very easy from the bubble of New York or la just say, you know, this should be a nonissue, but there so much, so many opinions and views in between those coasts that don't necessarily agree with that. And I think it's very clear that I'm a evangelical and a very conservative religious groups, uh, maintain quite a bit of power in this country because there are, you know, it's very clear that candidates are, are leaning one way or the other one when it comes to their approach of them. And there are viewpoints, uh, have to be taken seriously on the political spectrum. Uh, and that's, you know, it's there that these things are going to change.

Speaker 1:          02:11          I have, I have a, I have a personal issue with, with the idea that some people can tolerate homosexuality. Um, I do not tolerate women. I do not tolerate black or Asian people. Uh, I embraced them as they would anyone else. And so I think right now we're sending this message of a tolerance and I think it is a stepping stone toward embracing or even so much so that it's a nonissue. Um, I, I think right now the goal needs to be, um, to, to promote this as a normalized a sort of behavior. And I think that if we're taking these sort of bandaid or sideways approaches to get to a final result, we're going to end up with something that's still not viewed very well. So the, I think the message we need to be pitching is, um, this sort of normalized behavior. Gay people are just like straight people. They just leap with the same sex. I mean, that's really all it comes down to. I think it's easier for me to say that's such a simple message, not only because I live in a very urban area, but I'm a gay man. Uh, you know, on the same token, I don't think it's very easy for, um, you know, other folks in more conservative parts of the country, uh, to accept that message.

Speaker 1:          03:34          You know, I'm a little bit torn there because I think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be a platform for any message, but then I also believe it's foolish to imagine that it doesn't, um, you know, from, from the very basic of cutting out smoking for movies and what that did to views toward people who smoke. Um, you know, I think we're moving beyond, I like to think the token gay character in movies and TV shows, um, but I don't think we're quite there yet, but I think that's important to show that, uh, even in mainstream movies to have gay and lesbian characters who are normalized, they're not the token gay character. They are another character in that movie. Um, and I, and I liked the idea of sort of a plot lines within a TV and film that deal with gay men and women, but don't necessarily focus on that as a sole issue because then I, I think it sort of creates a caricature of what this is supposed to be. So I, I do think to an extent, Hollywood does hold some responsibility, but, uh, you know, homophobia exists in that industry like any other, um, while you know your agent or your publicist can be gay, uh, don't expect to sign on to a movie as an open gay person a and an expected big paycheck.

Speaker 1:          05:00          It's very easy for me to, as a movie goer to say Hollywood. The institution needs to change their ways. But I also think if they've put a, a openly gay character in a, in a major motion picture, uh, I don't think it would perform as well as the bar at the box office. So I think we do need to take small steps to reach that end all goal. It's not going to happen overnight. And I think it'd be foolish to assume so. But, um, you know, I think the American public does still have this cringe mentality when it comes to the idea of gay men and women playing leading roles or roles where they aren't the gay character, uh, all the way to Hollywood that is fearful of even opening up that possibility because the investment is so large. And, uh, in a studio wants to make that bet.
