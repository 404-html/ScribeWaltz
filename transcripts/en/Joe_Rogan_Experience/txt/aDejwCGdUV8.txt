Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I have been looking forward to this podcast for a long time. Gentlemen, this is a about as cool pod get for me as a fan. This is like one of my favorite ones because Randall Carlson and Graham Hawk Handcock together and your new book, magicians of the Gods, is it out officially everywhere. It's published on the 10th of November. Fantastic. Of the U s all over the u s and uh, Randall, you guys together is just so exciting to me because a, I know you guys spent a lot of time together and you were working together on just this current project. We did a fantastic research trip across the channel, scap lands of Washington state, which Randall has been walking the walk on for decades and he just showed me the absolute irrefutable evidence of cataclysmic flooding in that, in that area. And it plays a very important part in the book.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       UH, North America was the epicenter of a global cataclysm between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago. And when you see it through Randall's eyes and you get it immediately. This, this whole subject in, you know, since you've been on my podcast and you've been on the podcast, is something that comes up. I mean, I'm not kidding, four or five times a week, someone will grab me and ask me, when is Graham coming back on again? When's Randall coming back? And when I tell people that you guys are coming on together, the people who start freaking out. So, you know, we've been saying before this that people are taking time off work there. They're having little viewing parties. So two people out there, we're just excited as you are. So, um, tell me what's been going on. So tell me the Washington state thing. Tell me what you guys saw and, and what picture evidence and, and what was revealed. I'm going to pass that one to Randall first off.

Speaker 2:          00:01:44       Um, well we, uh, we're basically traveling. What we did was we traveled from Portland to the twin cities and what we did was essentially followed the, the southern margin of the great ice sheet for the most part. And what we were looking at was this evidence that the whole ice sheet had undergone this massive catastrophic sudden meltdown. And basically what we could, what we saw in the landscape was evidence that was oceanic level currents flowing off the ice sheets. In fact, the, the, um, the geologists that have been looking at this use a term called spur drop, which was originally a contrived to, um, it's, it's a, uh, a million cubic meters per second. And they originally came up with a to talk about, or ocean currents, like the Gulf stream and so on. Um, not realizing that down the road it was actually going to be applied to currents that were flowing over the land. Um, but that's what we were looking at was spelled that word as it's, it's named after the, uh, the scientists that first, uh, came up with the concept. It's s v e r Drup spur drop. It's 100 million,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       I'm sorry, a million cubic feet, cubic meters per second. Um, whoa. Which is very difficult to even envision, but when you see it on the landscape, I mean, for example, there's a place called the chemists prairie that Ronald took me to what you see these kind of ripples in the ground and they look a little bit like current ripples on the beach, you know, but actually they are current ripples, but they're 50 feet high and hundreds and hundreds of feet long and there that receding flood left those ripples on that, on that landscape. Then above the town of when Archie, there's a gigantic boulder which didn't come from we're Nachi. It weighs 18,000 tons and it got there in an iceberg the size of an oil tanker, which grounded against that side of the valley. The floodwaters receded, the iceberg melted away and it left this humongous boulder there and actually there's thousands of them.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       Thousands of these gigantic Boulder's just scattered across the landscape of the Pacific northwest northwest, and it all speaks of this cataclysmic, horrendous, humongous flood that happened to have Sunday, 200 years ago, 18,000 tons to these. You just threw out some giant numbers that the the meters per second and the eighteen thousand eighteen thousand tons is a ton, is 2000 to 18,000 tons is 18,000 to thousands so it's 36 million. If you want, I can pull up some emails or something of that order. Let's just say really fucking Mig. I made an enormous, an enormous thing and the fact is that there was just one, it would be spectacular, but there's thousands of them and, and they're all just washed away by this. When the, when the ice caps suddenly melted down and we know now that that happened because of the impact of several fragments of a, of a giant comment back 12,800 years ago released a huge flood of meltwater and that melt water carried.

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       It was jostling with icebergs, huge icebergs. And many of these icebergs had had rocks in chain within them as Glacio glacio ice moves, it snatches up and in chains rock and keeps it inside. There's a name for them. They're called glacio radix. And so they're in these icebergs and the icebergs are jostling against each other. And the flood is ripped up. Whole forest bites roots and there's mud and there's rubble and it's rumbling in it's, and you see it all on the landscape up there. And this is all carbon dated to this time period. The dating is very secure. Very, oh my God. If we look here at the image now, this is not from the catastrophic flood we're talking about obviously. But interestingly enough, this was a hundred year flood that happened in Georgia back in 2004 and what we had was a a flood plane that got uh, over top for the first time in decades and it left these current ripples here. And I just, I use this slide to show what we're used to under scale of phenomena that we would normally see this kind of phenomenon. So this is a normal, very large major storm. That makes sense. This was hurricane Ivan when it came through in 2004. It was, they referred to it as a hundred year flood. Right? So,

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       so this is a massive storm, but it's nothing out of the ordinary really. It's just, it's rare. It's rare. What you'll see here is, you know I've got a measuring tape here. You're going to see the wavelength is about three inches. The amplitude, the vertical height of these things is about three quarters of an inch. And so these are all, what we're looking at is all dry dirt that has sand. You said it's been rippled, it's been carried along in swept along in this water that was over this flood plain, which was two feet deep, carried along. And as the water declined it, it, it deposited this sand and then rippled it as the final stages. And we're looking at this, what year? How long after the f the storm was this? This was a week or two after the storm because within a month this was all all obscured by wind and everything.

Speaker 2:          00:06:46       So now just so you've got this by comparison, we'll go to this. This is what Graham was just talking about. Camus prairie and, and what you see here is there's ranches out there and you've got this 10 mile long field of these gigantic ripples. And if you look up in the upper left hand corner of the screen, you can see some of these ripples. They're like Graham said there, they're a hundred to 300 feet in wavelength and they're up to 50 feet in amplitude. And the water that flowed through here that that deposited, this was over a thousand feet deep.

Speaker 4:          00:07:23       So this is fractal, this fractal. You get it in the small scale in the, in the first image rattle showed the same phenomenon. They are with a flood just two feet deep. And then we come to this humongous testimony to what happened 12,800 years ago. And it's easy to drive through it and not really figure what you're driving through. But once you, once you look at it and realize what happened, it, it really dilates the imagination. So this must have been just an absolutely enormous event when it happened and, and really sun imaginable and unimaginable and human beings lived through that and it changed everything. These they called extinction level events, these global cataclysms wipe the slate clean. They, they change everything and they, and they set a new order in motion. A new audit follows that. So the classic example is the extinction of the dinosaurs.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       65 million years ago, that 10 dinosaurs into chickens, you know, and they were gone and it opened the way for mammals. And, and our distant ancestor is a sort of 65 million year old shrew, which was going nowhere until the dinosaurs were wiped by a cosmic impact. And then they began to evolve. And, and here we are. So dinosaurs became chickens and shrews became human being charges for me to imagine this. This is very hard to be for me to wrap my head around, but that we came from my shrew 65 million years. All these harder. That's the, that's, that's the, that's the story of evolution. One can buy into it or not, but that's the certainly mammals. We're going nowhere right before the dinosaurs were swept out of the, and the, the point I'm making is that these events, which are called extinction level events, they reset the clock.

Speaker 4:          00:09:02       They, they, they make everything start again. And, and this is why what happened in North America 12,800 years ago. It's so important because that period, the whole period was 12,800 to 11,600 years ago. That period stands right in the foundations of what we think of as the beginnings, the origins of civilization, and yet mainstream archeology and historians have not taken it into account and I don't blame them for that. This is new information. This is new science that's been mainly published in the professional journals since 2007 it's very intriguing new information, but we cannot any longer trust the established model of the origins of civilization since it does not take into account an extinction level event. Right in the foundations. And that's why I say the House of history appears to be built on foundations of sand. Now, this hasn't been adopted yet, but is it resisted?

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       Is has mainstream. It is whenever you, when ever you propose a cataclysm of any kind, it's a curious thing. I don't know whether it's psychological or something more sinister than that, but whenever you, whenever you propose that and present evidence for it, you can be sure that you will be descended upon by a furious crowd of critics and the group of scientists, more than 30 of them, very significant mainstream scientists who've been presenting the evidence for the comet impact have had a fight on their hands since 2007 but I can say with confidence, and I detail it at length in the book that they have won that fight. Every criticism that's been made at their work, they have refuted and they've come back with new evidence sometimes three or four papers a year and it's a compelling case and we can't ignore it and it seems to me as a casual observer, and I mean more cash, probably more into it than the average person, but no, not even close to you guys that as this evidence piles up like the, the nuclear glass that they keep finding it's about 12,000 that's one of what they call the impact proxies.

Speaker 4:          00:10:59       See what we got to consider is that we are looking at objects, which might be a mile wide, that are coming in to the atmosphere at 70,000 miles an hour and they are hot. You know, some people will remember comet shoemaker Levy nine that hit Jupiter back in 1994 that was a small comment, just two kilometers wide, broke into about 20 fragments. The explosive power of those impacts on Jupiter was 300 gigatons. Now let me put that into perspective. The entire world's nuclear arsenal, where it to go off at once would be 6.4 giga tons. So you're looking at something beyond imagination. The, the, the, the power of these impacts is absolutely colossal numbers. Numbers don't do it. Just imagine a world on fire. Uh, wasn't changed forever. The explosion that had Jupiter was about the size of the earth to, right? No, no, no, no. This was a comment. I mean, politics,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       the plume itself, the size of the earth. Yeah, absolutely. So we're looking at something that when, when it happened it was, what's the timeline around what, what was the calculations around somewhere around 11,000 years ago? Well, there's actually a period this is, this is an an rather than a single instant, and that's part of the mystery. First off, there are the impacts 12,800 years ago that causes this cataclysm centered on North America, but global and global temperature plummets. It, I mean, people who talk about global warming or today what, what happened, the change in temperature 12,800 years ago is just stunning. And this is undeniable, this in depth. The last time he was here with mainstream scientific data that's irrefutable. Absolutely. Core samples, ice core samples, apps along those lines. And they called the, just call it the younger dryas, and it's a 1,200 year period, temperatures plunge at the beginning, massive animal extinctions.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       And then 1,200 years later, equally suddenly temperatures shoot up again dramatically. And there's another series of floods so that the period is 12,800 to 11,600 years ago. And I think, I don't know if Randal agrees, we're sure that the comment was the cause of the first event 12,000, 800 years ago. I think other bits of the comet, we're responsible for the second event as well. I think there was an impact in ocean, which through water vapor up into the upper atmosphere caused a greenhouse effect and created that sudden spike in warming and that huge flood,

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       those two warming spike show up very dramatically in the Greenland ice cores. And I pulled these up I think in the last meeting, but it would be good to reference it again. And um, basically what you see here is warming spike number one is here and warming spike number two is here and these were extreme, you know, we're talking about 10, 10 degrees centigrade roughly in perhaps a year or two. And this translates into about 17 or 18 degrees Fahrenheit. So we're talking many times greater than the, the warming of the last century or two. Um, instantly basically just like that. And this, this is this, this what we see here, brackets, this, this whole episode of this, this period of transition from the glacial age to this Nice Warm Holocene interglacial age that we're in now. And you know, Graham brought up about how this sits right at the very foundation of our modern history. And if you look at whether it's the dispersion of languages, the beginning of agriculture, the first cities, the domestication of animals, what you see over and over again is the same date showing up, you know, eight, nine, 10,000 years ago. And in this model that we're describing here, we're not really seeing the genesis of civilization. We're seeing the rebooting of civilization in the aftermath

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       of these events. They're not the only thing that makes sense. This is, this is, this is what we have now. We have now the data that makes sense of what previously has been very mysterious and unexplained evidence. So for folks who are not aware of both of your work, to me, this is so fascinating because I've been a fan of your, your books since God. I don't, I mean more than a decade. Right? What, when did it come out in the nineties? Well think of prince of the gods which was published in 1995 which is, which is 20 years ago, and magicians of the gods, the new book is the sequel to fingerprints. And I've written it because there's just this massive new information that changes the whole picture completely. Uh, fingerprints of the gods. I started reading sometime in the late nineties and just became engrossed in it and fascinated by this concept, that civilization and as, as you put it, that we are a species that has amnesia and that just forgot what our past was.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       But the two of you together is what's so fascinating cause it puts this puzzle together, your obsession with asteroidal impacts and these massive extinction events and your knowledge of this ancient architecture that doesn't make any sense. And these ancient construction methods that seem to differ and that the timelines and for people who aren't aware of the whole story behind it, the erosion on the enclosure of the Sphinx where where they made this fake has thousands of years of rainfall erosion. That doesn't make any sense because the last time there was rain, the Nile Valley was like 9,000 BC, which is right. Some around their ass really weave. The climate of, of of Egypt has been as dry as it is today for about the last 5,000 years, so you have to go back. You actually have to go back to this period, to this younger dryas period to get those heavy rainfalls that could have eroded the Sphinx in the way it is and I want to pay tribute to the work of John Anthony West and Robert Schoch from Boston University because they broke this story way back in 1992 and at the time the Egypt illogical establishment of course were furious that anybody dared to suggest that the Sphinx might be 12,000 years old.

Speaker 3:          00:16:59       The Egyptologist said, we know the Sphinx dates from 2,500 BC. Actually, one of the things I've done in this book is look at what the Egyptology case rests on. And it's a fairy tale. It rests on nothing. It's kind of ideology. It's a, it's, it's, it's their idea of how things should be rather than any real factual evidence that puts the Sphinx at 2,500 BC and the geology puts the sphinx much, much older. Now, the argument of the archeologists at the time was, and anyway, the Sphinx couldn't possibly be 12,000 years old because if that was the work of some unknown culture 12,000 years ago, we're going to find lots of other monuments around the world that had 12,000 years old and we don't find any. Um, well that was 1992 but now we're in 2015. And the sight of God Beckley Tepi in Turkey has been discovered with it's gigantic

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       megaliths a deliberately buried time capsule buried more than 10,000 years ago and created 11 and a half thousand years ago. And if you can make go back the Tempe, you can make the Sphinx. We are finding the fingerprints of this lost civilization popping up all around the world. Indeed on any archaeological site where you can be absolutely sure of the dating, the dating proves to be much older than we have been taught by archeologists. They recently discovered a huge megalithic site, 40 meters underwater between in the Sicily channel. It's been underwater for best part of 10,000 years, which means that Megalithic site is at least that old and maybe much older and we can be sure about the dating because it's underwater. Likewise, we can be sure of the dating of Quebec Lee Tapi because whoever made it deliberately buried it, sealed it, and no later organic material got in to contaminate the carbon dating record and give falsely young.

Speaker 4:          00:18:44       They didn't buried someone else during that time period, buried it, but somebody buried it. They went to them. We don't know when it was built, but we know it's buried at least 10 to 12 the dates that are coming out of it now, the earliest dates now, it's important to be clear that there's much more of God Beckley Tepi under the ground. There's, there's actually about 50 times as much as has already been excavated, which is under the ground still and not being dug up yet. They know it's there because they'd been over the whole site with ground penetrating radar and what they're seeing is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these huge 20 to 50 ton t-shaped megalithic pillars buried under the ground. Somebody just as somebody went to enormous lengths to create this site, they also, or somebody else, went to enormous lengths to burry it and actually got Beckley. Tapi means potbellied hill in the Turkish language and that whole potbellied hill that covers this site was artificially put there by human beings, teams of men and women with buckets filled with rubble and stones filling it in and covering it up.

Speaker 4:          00:19:45       So strange. And there's no, no, no guesses or theories as to why they did this. Really not. There's the, there's not, it's just a fact that it happened because, because archeologists and geologists can tell from the nature of the material that covers these pillars that it isn't a natural sedimentation that they would deliberately covered up what's going to be satisfying to you guys too. Obsessed, crazy man come together and your theories lock in like puzzle pieces and ha ha. Well you, you've got the right word there because this is, man, I even respect put my had up to that as as I've, I've absolutely, you've got to be a bit obsessed to stick with somebody who I, you know, I came in for an enormous amount of, of criticism and flack when I published fingerprints of the gods and I'm human. It hurts when people say really bad things about me.

Speaker 4:          00:20:36       But what I've learned is you just have to persist. You just have to, you just have to keep going. Even if your ideas are shouted down by, you know, the established holders of knowledge in our society, if you feel strongly enough about those ideas, you've got to hang with them. And I've hung with these ideas for more than 20 years now. And what we're seeing is just a massive new evidence that that basically vindicates the notion of a, of, of a lost civilization. See if I may say go Beckley Tepi um, the earliest dates they've pulled out of the ground now, which they think is the foundation of the site is 11,600 years ago. And that is really significant because 11,600 years ago was the second episode of cataclysm at the end of the younger dryers. And we know it was accompanied by massive global flooding.

Speaker 4:          00:21:23       Is it possible that this was covered up then? And it wasn't covering up intentionally by people that it was covered up as a part of it was made after the cataclysm was over. Uh, an archeologist have a problem with this because the site is very sophisticated. It contains the world's first perfectly north south aligned structure and you can't do that without precise astronomy. In fact, they are huge astronomical implications to the go back to the Tempe site. The architecture is, is massive. And you see the problem archaeology has is that up till now they've been teaching us that megalithic sites like this astronomically, a megalithic sites like this, our maximum of five to five and a half thousand years old. And suddenly we're looking at a site which is far bigger than any other megalithic site known in the world, which is at least 6,000 years older than any other known sites.

Speaker 4:          00:22:13       Or how do they explain this? Our ancestors, I supposed to have been just hunter gatherers at that time, nomads following the game, not with a sophisticated societal organization that would have specialists who had these knowledge, who had the skills, who could put this, put this work together. So the fairy tale archeologist are now telling about good Beckley Tapi is that one morning a group of hunter gatherers woke up somehow divinely inspired with, with the complete knowledge of Megalithic architecture and how to organize a workforce on how to bring them to a site, which by the way, there's no water on that site. And to put this whole, this whole proposition together and at the same time, exactly at the same moment, 11,000, 600 years ago, we suddenly get evidence of agriculture spreading all over Turkey. It's like go Beckley Tepi as a center of innovation and associated with it is the birth of agriculture in Turkey.

Speaker 4:          00:23:02       Uh, and, and to me this looks like a transfer of technology. It does not look to me like a group of hunter gatherers woke up one morning magically equipped with the ability to invent agriculture and create a megalithic site like this. It looks to me like people who already had that knowledge came into that area, settled there and try to pass on their knowledge to the local people and maybe used to go back to the Tempe as a kind of university or initiation center to train and teach people in those skills. That's what it feels like. And another point is that that same day, Dylan thousand 600 years ago is the date that Plato gives us for the destruction and submergence by flood of the lost civilization of Atlantis. And up till now, archeologists have dismissed the whole Atlantis story and they regard it as kind of pseudoscience, although it comes from Plato. But Plato said very clearly that this happened 9,000 years before the time of so long and so long lived in 600 BC. So Plato is telling us Atlantis went down 9,600 BC, 11,600 years ago. Exactly the date of the second spike of the younger dryas cataclysm.

Speaker 5:          00:24:08       If you're look, you're at this graph, we see random pull this sucker up close to you so that you get a little bit more. It's a, we can see here, these are um, studies of sea level rise at the end of the ice age. And rather than it being a smooth curve, which was the old model, which you can see represented by the dashed line, it's too enormous spikes. And that second spike, it melt what? There you see MWP dash one B. That's meltwater pulse one B. And you've got meltwater pulse one, a meltwater pulse one B is dated precisely to 11,600 years ago. This is crazy. It's like everything aligns, everything aligns the, that, the, the nuclear glass that they're finding. And then the core samples, well that's all the same, run the same test. What's the point

Speaker 4:          00:24:54       I wanted to make when we talk about these objects coming in at 70,000 miles an hour, they are packing an enormous amount of kinetic energy and heat. And when they hit the ground, uh, there are distinct products left in the soil and that does include nano diamonds. You can not, they're created by the shock and the impact. You can only see them, you know, that under a microscope, that tiny, tiny, tiny things and carbons failures and the melt glass, which is just basically identical to trinity site, which is the melt glass that you get from nuclear explosions and they're called impact proxies. And there's a distinct layer of the soil all around the world data to 12,000, 800 years ago, which contains this stuff and also contains the evidence of continental wildfires burning. And I think Randall might want to address that issue of continental wildfires and why they happen.

Speaker 5:          00:25:42       The, all these images are beautiful bullets. Um, note that most people are just listening to this, so if you're just listening to this, those images that Randall put up on the screen show these enormous straight up and down spikes of the water level rising, which has to be caused by some ocean level rises, which has to be because caused by something extremely dramatic like that. Just looking at that like, wow, what happened there? Well nuts. That's the melting of the ice sheets. The sudden rapid catastrophic meltdown or the ice sheets dumping millions of cubic kilometers of water back into the ocean basins and how those little dashes on the bottom, the the numbers, how many years do they represent like the, that spike that goes straight up and down though the largest spike. How much time does that represent? Well, you've got to to hear that basically represent the, the margin of error in the dating. The earliest version of it is the spike you see on, right. The latest version

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       did you see is under on the left and it varies between about 14 and 13,000 years for the first spike. The second spike is dating now too. About, like I said, about 11,600 the, the numbers across the bottom arth k y r means thousands of years before present. So you can see nine 10 that would be 10,000 years ago. So essentially seems like our earth went through like a thousand years of horror.

Speaker 4:          00:27:10       Thousand Years of hell. Uh, it, it, it's, it's really impossible to imagine what the, what the world was like then for the people who lived in it. And I think it makes sense of why all around the world we have a story of a global flood. This is, this is not something confined to the story of Noah in the Bible. This is a universal story of a cataclysm that changed the world and wiped away a former golden age and left us with the present order of things all around the world. And secondly, all around the world, and this is intriguing. There is a universal fear of comments. Now why should we be afraid of comments? We see comments up in the sky. They whizzed through, they have this nice tail, they look, they look pretty. Why should we be scared of them? But every culture in the world has myths and traditions that associate comments with disaster. Uh, and, and I think it's pretty obvious why, because this, this comet impact 12,800 years ago was remembered by the survivors and they passed that memory down to their children and their children's children. And it's still with us today and it's now we know based on something very real

Speaker 3:          00:28:13       well, it seems like to me as a lay person with all this evidence and all this evidence that correlates, it's all corresponding, it all seems to fit together. It would seem that this would be something that a lot of mainstream scientists and archeologists would be extremely interested in. Like why would they, why would they try to ignore something like the first thing they've tried to do is to get rid of it. This is often the case where new information emerges that contradicts established, established theories. And it's a strange phenomenon in science because we like to think of scientists as as rational and reasonable people. But the fact is that when you get very committed to a particular model, to a particular idea, I think you start to connect your own personality to it. And any attack on that idea becomes an existential, a tourniquet on you yourself.

Speaker 3:          00:28:59       How Sad. And it is an, it is sad because again, and again, what we see is the, uh, the new facts being dismissed because they don't fit the existing theory where in fact what we should be doing is modifying the existing theory to explain the newly discovered facts. And this is a, this is a problem in the whole history of science. I remember when I first became aware of that problem when I watched the documentary and the mysteries of the Sphinx where doctor Robert Schoch met with, uh, some archeologist in Egypt. It wasn't Zoe Huw. Asa was a, a Western guy and he met with this guy and they were explaining their theory about the erosions of the Sphinx. And he was laughing at it, me, me, but openly

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       mocking yet, like what evidence were, where's this evidence? But it was the way he did. It was just so riddled with ego. I was like, wow, how could you, first of all the concept of 11,000 years ago when you start thinking about 11th, that's a long time. And what, what evidence really would be there other than stone? It seems to me that it'd be very little. I mean, you've whatever fragments of pottery, you'd be lucky to find, we're lucky defined, but looking for some massive evidence that clearly shows beyond any shadow of it outweigh. Here it is. I got, boy, you're, you're asking for a lot from 11,000 years ago and you have something pretty substantial right in front of you and he's mocking it.

Speaker 4:          00:30:23       Exactly. This is why I've, I've come to view archeology and history as a kind of more ideology really than, than science. Um, there's, there's a, there's an ideological view about how civilization developed that we have this long, slow, gradual, politically correct rise from the upper paleolithic, from the hunter gatherers through the Neolithic into the first cities. And we go on and on and then we develop technologies and here we are the apex. And the pinnacle of this whole story and Gosh, we're so proud of ourselves and our achievements and we think we're wonderful and we praise and value our technology. I've got nothing against technology, but there's a hint of arrogance in this. There's a hint of, of, of pride that it was all about us. And I, I think that the, once you start introducing this, this new view of history that they may have been an earlier civilization, a high civilization which was utterly wiped out by a global cataclysm, why it contradicts that ideological position and you find yourself in ideological struggle with archeologists and that's why, you know, sort of hub.

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       For example, if my book is handed over to any archeologist to review, they're just going to piss all over it. They're not even probably going to read it. They're just going to say, Hank, what they say again and again, Hancock is a pseudo scientist. Nobody should listen to him. That's there. A system of attack is to first of all devalue you so much that nobody will ever listen to you. And that's why I appreciate the support of just real down to earth people out there who are looking at this information and finding the actually, yeah, the story of history we've been taught doesn't make sense. And this new information does make sense of it. Well, this new information

Speaker 5:          00:32:00       in my eyes, it seems, it's so substantial and there's so much of it. It's so, so much of it fits together. It's incredibly difficult to ignore and much more so than when that documentary and his finks was created. So that was quite a while ago. Charlton Heston was the,

Speaker 4:          00:32:18       the narrator to it. And, and, and um, you know, at that time, uh, we were sticking our necks out, putting that, putting that information forward. I was in that documentary as well. But today things have changed. And, and what I see is the, the archeological mainstream in a state of denial about this information, they just don't want to recognize it and absorb it, but they're going to have to recognize it. It's going to be forced

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       upon them, whether they like it or not. It's so sad because you, you know, you count on these people to distribute the information, but they, their egos get involved in things. And if you've been teaching something for a long time, then it turns out you gave out master's degrees on things that were completely incorrect until lately. It's absolutely, it's gotta be something else. So though this sounds a bit con con con conspiratorial, I think the existing view of history is part of a mind control system in our society. It's a, it's something that we're presented with that we take in with our mother's milk and we're never supposed to question. I think it's, if you control the past, you do actually control the present and the future as well. So, but you mean if you have an absolutely established narrative that you're teaching and you're unwilling to look at any possible variations to that, you're, you're saying like almost from an authority position. We know what happened and we know where we're going, but if you say, shit, we don't know what happened, then it's, well we'll then who are you to tell us where we're going? Exactly. And it starts to raise questions over everything, right?

Speaker 2:          00:33:44       Yeah. And we're kind of in this, in this mode now where, um, there's a, uh, a very large growing political agenda around the idea that humans are the sole cause of global change and that we're the dominant force within this whole process. Now here we come along and we're saying, well, no, there's actually been a forces unleashed on this planet that really utterly dwarf anything we've done yet. What does that do to that, to that paradigm? You see that that's what I think what we're coming down here to part of the, um, the scenario now is that humans are engaged in causing the sixth great mass extinction as we talked about in one of your, one of the previous, and now we're coming along and saying, well, wait a second. Here's something from outer space that has come in and caused the last great mass extinction on earth.

Speaker 2:          00:34:34       And what's interesting I found is that quite a number of the, um, the, the scientists that have been in the opposition to the younger dryas impact hypothesis have been in the forefront of pushing this, this scenario of human caused mass extinction and blaming the extinction of the great megafauna that died out 12,000 years ago on human hunters, which I again, we talked about that and I considered that ludicrous that Paleo Indian hunters using spears are going to cause the extermination of 10 million woolly mammoths before they could even reproduce, along with 120 other species of Megafauna.

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       Well, 65% of all mammals in North America were wiped out somewhere around that time. Mega mammals, mega man, which is over a hundred pounds in body weight, essentially. Yeah. And actually more like 75 or 75 or 75% of it was almost instantaneous load. Right. I mean, it was over a course of a very short period of time after time. The scientists who have been diligently working in this, in this

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       field since that they've published their first paper in, in in 2007 I've just brought out in a new paper in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, July, 2015 where they're doing a statistical analysis and all the sites where the evidence comes from. And what that tells us is that this is what is referred to as an ISO crown. This event 12,800 years ago. It's not, we're not looking at the effects of a hundred or 200 years of um, events. We're looking at something that happened effectively in a single afternoon across 50 million square kilometers of the earth's surface.

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Ooh, that gives me goosebumps a single afternoon. Yeah. All over the world. Everything changes forever and it's fucked for a thousand years.

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       Absolutely. Absolutely. And then I'd like Randall to address this issue of continent wide wildfires because we do see this in the, in the, in the stratum that when you get this super heated ejector coming down on and on ancient primal forests, consider the effect.

Speaker 2:          00:36:33       This is Marie Springs, one of the Clovis sites. And this is what the was known as the Black Mat layer. Where's Murray Springs? It's in Arizona and it's southern Arizona. And it's near the Clovis site, which is, um, New Mexico, um, called the Clovis impact site. Well, no, the Clovis site was where the one of the first places in North America where for human remains were found in association with a extinct mega mammals such as woolly mammoths. Um, and it's just outside of Clovis, New Mexico. They refer to them as the Clovis culture because the culture was one of the casualties of this climate impact. The comment impact is often referred to as the Clovis comment. Okay. Yes. And, and many of these Clovis sites and has been over 50 of them around now documented over North America. I think about two thirds of them have this black matte layer, which shows a very clearly in this image now that black matte layer is black because of the, uh, considerable amount of carbon, carbon soot that's in it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       So in other words, right there, that's the evidence of your wildfires is that this blanket of soot over the continent that left this black matte layer and below that black matte layer you'll find extinct mega mammals. Like here you see the Yellow Arrow there, points to the black mat layer. Now if you look up, you'll see how it's more buff colored. That was the color of all of this. But the suit that was in that black matte layer has dispersed and colored the other adjacent layers. But you'll notice the bones below are the bones of extinct mammals. The bones found above it, our extent or still existing mammals and net layer separates, um, these, these, these two domains of extinct mammals and extent. I have just a very clear line. Yeah. And, and you can see it, it shows up so clearly, right to people who listening to this, when we're looking at the original image that Randall showed, it's almost like an Oreo cookie. Like there's a clean line and then there's the white filling underneath. I mean, it is as clear as day. And what are we talking about? Like how much fire and for how long creates this area? Well, you're basically talking about burning up a considerable portion of the bio mass of North America in unglazed glaciated North America to do this.

Speaker 3:          00:38:57       So you have the ice cap north of roughly Minnesota and the south of it. You have a heavily vegetated area covered with primal forests and that's what goes on fire. And the reason it goes on fire is because when these impact has come in, they generate a huge amount of heat and and what is called ejector superheated ejectors throwing up into the upper atmosphere and it falls down all over the continent and it's sets the world on fire. Oh God no. At the procedure is so difficult in this. It's a distance. There's numbers that you guys are throwing around and his concepts you throwing around that. I just, I have to pause when you're saying, well wait a minute, I've got to try to fit this in somewhere. But it's the whole, the whole world on fire. Yeah. This is why I've written this book because it's mind boggling. It's mind boggling material. And, and up till now, most of the information has been confined to the really rarefied scientific journals. Very little of it has got out into the public domain. So one of the things I've tried to do is to put this together into a, into a form that's very accessible to the general public because we all need to know about this. This is our yesterday, this is our background. This is, this is where we come from. The present order of the world has descended from that moment.

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       And what is the mainstream explanation for what we're looking at here? Like how do they, how do they describe this? Well, the mainstream, the mainstream, to me now, it's Firestone and West [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       Yeah. And when Ronald says Firestone in western Canada, he's talking about some of the lead scientists who have presented the evidence for the younger dryas impact because they have triumphed, although they were attacked and sometimes viciously, and frankly speaking, sometimes dishonestly, they were attacked, but they defended themselves so well and they kept on bringing in new data and new information that actually now we should be regarding their view as the mainstream. Yeah, there are a few critics still hanging in there who would like human beings to have been responsible for the extinction of all the the mega mammals and who would, who you know, who just are in denial about the climate change at that time. But there they're no longer than mainstream. In my view. One of the problems with the theories, what you show the last time you were here, these, the evidence of these woolly mammoths had died instantaneously and that they're, they're massive fields of them that something had to happen and ones with like their legs broken just bent over from the impact. Like it's pretty clear something went down and all of these pieces point together and including looking at this, which is just, this is blowing my mind, this idea of the world on fire just,

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       well there were some places that apparently got spared like Australia or something. Well, Australia actually suffered a major mass extinction, but earlier, probably from some previous event, maybe 30,000 years ago, but just trying to figure out where to go off and having a central Africa seems to have been one of the places of refuge because if we look at the distribution of mega mammals in the world today, where do we find the greatest concentration in in Africa? Right? Well, Africa has retained 90% of its mega mammals from the pleistocene, whereas North America lost 75% if you go back to North America during the Ice Age, there was as many mega mammals, if not more species than there is in Africa today. But what we see is that extinction relates directly to habitat loss and basically not much survived in either north or South America. North and South America were both severely affected by these events and lost 75% of their mega mammals. Eurasia lost between, depending on where you go, between 30 and 50% Africa only lost about 10% of them. And that's why you see so many big animals still in Africa today. And a lot of them, I think probably disbursed from the area around the great rift zone. It seems like in a lot of the areas actually where we're finding early hominids is, is in that same area that seems like for whatever reason it was spared somewhat of the, the extreme severity that the rest of the planet it's suffered.

Speaker 4:          00:43:06       It's an interesting situation because when we look at the arguments of history and archeology, very little of the story is told in North America, uh, in, as, as it's taught in schools and universities today. You know, they look at places like Sumeria in Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt and further down in South America, some of the, the, the great cultures of the, of the, of the Andes, but it's like North America is missing from the map. They talk about hunter gatherers coming in here across the Bering strait and there's still a, a dog, each faction of archeology that wants to maintain that. That just happened about 13,000 years ago. Um, and, and that there was no human beings in the Americas before that. Although the mass of contradictory evidence is overwhelming that dogma as well. It's obvious that the Americans were populated long before that and those pop populations did not only come in across the Bering strait.

Speaker 4:          00:43:57       They came in in in other ways as well and, and, and then there just seems to be nothing for a very long time and, and North Americans kind of left out of the story of civilization. Well now I think we know why because North America was at the heart of this disaster. It was at the absolute epicenter and the slate was completely wiped clean here. And that's what archeologists are, are looking at. They're seeing a wipe clean slate and they think they're seeing the beginning of something actually they're not. They're seeing the movement on have something after a horrendous disaster. Wow. This, it's so

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       hard to wrap my mind around this idea that for literally a thousand years, the earth was just riddled with asteroidal impacts and fire and nuclear winter because of the Dustin mass extinction of, gee, it's so hard that the numbers that you're throwing around the ideas behind it, it's, it's, it's very difficult for folks

Speaker 4:          00:44:56       tonight put something in there that brings it home in a way. See this, um, event 12,800 years ago, we know now it was caused by fragments of a very large comet and the work suggest that that comment may have been more than 100 kilometers in diameter originally when it entered the Minnesota system. See, call it 62 miles. Right. Big, big old comment. These comments, they come in from deep space. How big is the one that killed the dinosaurs? Like five miles? Well, that's thought to be 10 kilometers wide. That that x miles, that, that object ten six, six miles wide at the times that, yeah. These things, these things come in from deep space. There are reservoirs of comets. There's a place that they call the Oort cloud, which is just so far away that it's almost impossible to imagine it, but it contains trillions of comments and often they're, they're in stable orbits.

Speaker 4:          00:45:49       They're not coming into the inner solar system. But as this solar system orbits around the center of the Galaxy, our galaxy is the Milky Way and we are in orbit around the center of the galaxy, our son, our solar system, everything is in orbit around the center of the galaxy. And that orbit is not only in the plain of the galaxy. Imagine a dolphin diving up and down, coming out of the surface of the sea, descending below, rising up again. That's what the solar system is doing. And those passages through the galactic plane disturb the Oort cloud and they send comments winging in to the inner solar system. Thank God for Jupiter, Jupiter with its huge gravity is the great protector of the Earth. We should all wake up every day and say, thank you Jupiter, thank you Jupiter, that this doesn't happen too often, but every now and then a comet gets past you.

Speaker 4:          00:46:41       But as God and comes in and enters the inner solar system and the calculations show. This happened about 20,000 years ago and that comment went into an orbit that crosses the orbit of the Earth twice a year. We are still crossing the orbit of that comment twice a year and there is still a very disturbing amount of debris within it. It's called the Taurid meteor stream. We've actually just finished our latest passage through the Taurid meteor stream. The earth passes through the story of meteor stream twice a year. It takes 12 days to pass through it because the Tory media story more numbers is 30 million kilometers wide and we orbit at the rate of 2.5 million kilometers a day, so 30 it took 12 days to pass through it and in the last 11,000 or so years we've been lucky. We've been passing through this 30 million mile wide stream.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       We've been passing through bits where they're just filaments of small debris, but the evidence is that it is actually full of large lucky rocky debris, including one object that maybe as much as 30 kilometers in diameter sitting in that tour in meteor stream. So it's like I compare it to like strapping on a blindfold and crossing a six lane highway and just hoping that you don't get hit by a truck. You know, that's what it, that's what it comes down to. And we've been, we've been lucky so far. Actually, the most recent definite impact from the Taurid meteor stream, uh, was in 1,908 and that was in Russia in Siberia. It's called the Tom Gasca event. As I said, there's two passages through the stream. One in June, end of June or early July and one in November. And this was at the end of June and object, not very big.

Speaker 4:          00:48:18       Uh, about a hundred meters in diameter. Came out of the Taurid meteor stream, entered the atmosphere of the earth and actually blew up in the sky. It was an air burst about five kilometers where the ground it flattened 80 million trees across 2000 square kilometers. I'm sorry I keep using kilometers was 2000 square kilometers of the earth's surface. That's an area about the size of the city of London. If that impact had happened over an inhabited area, hundreds of thousands of people would be killed and we would all be paying much more attention to the Taurid meteor stream today than we are presently doing. We should be paying attention to it. So we just got super lucky that it hit in a very lightly populated area and it didn't even hit and blew up in the sky above it. Pull up, see if you can find some image of Tom Guskey cause it's pretty staggering and it literally looks like there was like a match stick forest and someone pushed over like a series of dominoes or something.

Speaker 4:          00:49:16       Yeah, yeah. Oh God. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie is a wizard kids out in the ball over there. Yeah. So, so here's the thing, we are still interacting with the debris of this comment that changed the world. 12,800 years ago. It, it, it's not something remote and distant. It's part of our, it's part of our daily lives and, and it is something we should be paying attention to and a number of astronomers are very concerned about the tour it meteor stream. Now I don't want to be the one who goes around the world, you know where in the Sandwich board saying that doom is nigh, sky is falling. Yeah. I don't want to be that. I don't want to manifest that. I don't want to bring that down. I actually want to say that there's something positive to say about this. We are almost certainly the first civilization that's ever existed on this planet that has the capacity to intervene in our cosmic environment.

Speaker 4:          00:50:08       Should we choose to do so. We can make sure that we are not the next loss civilization. We can make sure that life and light continue on this planet and that our story continues, but we need to pay attention to our cosmic environment. And a number of scientists are now saying the same thing, that, that it's irresponsible of us to pretend that impacts like this may they just happen every hundred million years. We don't need to worry about them. We are intimately connected with a force that can change life on earth and we have the power to do something about it. So I would suggest instead of wasting, you know, trillions of dollars globally, uh, creating weapons of mass destruction to destroy one another and to, to manifest the hatred and fear and suspicion that had just whizzing around the world. Right now we should be looking at a grand human project, a cooperative effort to make our cosmic environment safe. And we have the technology now. It's just a matter of choice. It's just a matter of budget. Trillions of dollars are spent on arms and roughly 20 to $30 million are spent a year on so-called space watch. It's a ridiculous of chump change given the nature of the threat and the implications

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       about the same as the cost to run one Mcdonald's restaurant for a year is what we're spending on studying the cosmic environment in terms of threats. That's a hilarious comparison. Yeah. What a resourceful little freaky animal people are. If you really stop and think about it almost wiped off the face of the planet, you know, ten thousand twelve thousand years ago. And then we reach a point where here we are in 2015 and through all these inventions were starting to rediscover what our history truly is and rediscover the, the history of the earth and, and its, its interplay with all these cosmic forces, you know, modern humans but have now 199,000

Speaker 4:          00:52:00       yeah. The earliest, I mean the earliest definite anatomically modern human skeletal remains date back about 196,000 years. There's some other plausible ones at about 210,000 years. Nothing before that. It doesn't mean that we were not anatomically modern before that. It may just mean that archaeologists haven't found that the data yet, but we can be sure that people like you and me have been around for about 200,000 years with the anatomically modern form and the anatomically modern brain. So there's a mystery right there. Why did we wait 190,000 years to establish the first civilizations? It, it raises the possibility that we could have done so much earlier and that the slate has been wiped clean.

Speaker 2:          00:52:44       Think about it this way, Joe. My grandfather was born in 1895 the main mode of transportation aside from railroads at that time, was horseback, right? His grandfather, you know, would've been born pre civil war. So when five generations, we've gone from the very first railroads, the beginning of the industrial revolution to where we are now in five generations. Now, if you go back 200,000 years, say 196,000 and we divide that by 25 I love and random breaks out there looking at it almost, we're looking at almost 8,000 generations of humans. Wow. Yeah. Now think about that. Within five generations. We've gone from

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       90% dominant agriculturally based subsistence farming, right feudal system to where we are now. But now we've got 8,000 generations of humans on this planet who knows what we may have accomplished in the past. But once you put this perspective and, and you got to understand that the, that the catastrophe, we're talking about 12,000 years ago, while all the evidence suggests it was the most severe, probably at least within 5 million years because the last time we can find a species loss equivalent to the terminal pleistocene species loss was 5 million years ago. The hamp helion event it's called, um, which then I would then consider that again is a, is a measuring stick for habitat loss, which would in turn be a measure of the severity of whatever happened. But the point is, is that in the time that we humans have been around, there have been multiple catastrophes of a global scale.

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       Not as severe as the one we're talking about here, but certainly the, the framework of this planet has been shaken numerous times. And in 200,000 years, we've had probably four great glacial cycles that have come and gone. Now, just a glacial cycle alone. I mean, think about that, what the ice will do to the landscape and, and dropping sea levels 400 feet and now during an ice age, you've got to bear in mind that probably the most habitable place to be on the plan that is going to be on coastlines along the miles of rivers and so forth. What happens when all that ice melts and sea level comes up three or 400 feet and, and it's going to pretty much a race, most of the evidence of human habitation. Although, and I think I talked about this last time and you would probably concur with this, the importance of marine archeology.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       It's extremely important. Yes. But again, unfortunately, marine archeology has its eye off the ball. Most of the resources in Marina killogy going to shipwrecks looking for looking for shipwrecks. Right. Um, and, and you know, I get that it's a really interesting to look at shipwrecks, but, but there is a prejudice in archeology which says that could have been no interesting civilization before 12,000 years ago. So since the, those lands that were submerged by rising sea levels had been underwater for 10 to 12,000 years, we're not really interested in human habitations there. And, and, and this is the problem, a very focused effort needs to be made to look at these lost lands. I can put that in miles, 10 million square miles of the earth's surface, roughly Europe and China added together was submerged by the rising sea levels at the end of the last ice age. That's what's missing from the record. You know, and, and again, we're talking about wiping the slate clean and rattles right. Those ice caps that sit on top of a continent, which are mountain high, they're going to just ground grind to powder, anything that lies below them. So was there a civilization there before

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       where the ice cap formed? Who knows,

Speaker 2:          00:56:26       right. Yeah. A mile high of ice. Yeah. Even more in some cases over over central Canada, it might've been as much as two miles, two miles, just pushing across the ground like an eraser. Exactly. Writing everything, crushing the surface of the ground down. I think in our discussions of Atlantis, we covered that a little bit. Crushing the surface of the, uh, of the land down by perhaps a couple of thousand feet. Isostatic depression. You remember the geology lesson I gave you last time about icer static depression and we discussed how at this very moment the your ass is demonstrating an important geological phenomena of Isis, static depression sitting on net cushion cause you're sitting on and if you were to stand up, what happens when you stand up? The cushion comes back up, doesn't it? It's exactly what happens. And you can almost picture the planet breathing and affect the, the, the, the ice is released from the continental surface.

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       The continental surface begins to rebound. The weight is transferred back into the ocean basins and there has to be that what's called Realogy, which is the study of the distribution of the inner mass of the earth requires that there be compensation. So if if in one area of the surface the land is rising somewhere else, it has to be subsiding. And the obvious place would be that as you transfer the weight from the continent back into the ocean basins, that the ocean basins are going to subside. And this brings us to the whole question of, of, of uh, of the scientific veracity of, of a sunken landmass.

Speaker 4:          00:57:58       You're thinking, you have an interesting point on the age of yours in this, in this sense, because then you have this massive, it's like a see saw that you have this massive weight pressing down on the North American continent and suddenly it's lifted that, that, that massive weight pushed down North America, but it lifted up other areas. The other end of the seesaw and the weight comes off, this end goes up and the other end goes down and suddenly you get the possibility of the submergence of a land mass. It just falls under the sea.

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       And there is actually considerable empirical evidence suggesting that there was massive post glacial subsidence along the Mid Atlantic Ridge, which is where the are. Yeah. Yeah. And which is pretty much were Plato said Atlanta's work. Yeah. Wasn't there some discovery of some concentric circles that were submerged somewhere near Spain that they considered to be a possible

Speaker 4:          00:58:49       Cadiz? Um, I don't think that near Spain. Yeah, it's, it's um, I think it's much more recent. Okay. Much, much more recent than the, than the information we're looking at another, yeah, that was submerged. That was so much, that can be a lot of reasons why this, why, why this happens. Actually it's happening in the, in the UK where I'm from because the ice sheets in the UK where on the north of the UK, over Scotland and they were pressing Scotland down and they closed the southern part of England to rise up. Then when you take those ice sheets off, the southern part starts go down. So that's places like the isle of wight in the English Channel, they're sinking beneath the sea because of this. Still the effect of that rebound is happening to them.

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       Glacial four bulge outside the, the glaciers. The land is pushed up. You know, this speaks to how people have a hard time accepting some of this new information. I have a friend who's a scientist and a, the last time you were on, she said to me, did you have a climate denier on your show? A climate change denier? And I say that he's definitely not denying it. No, but some people, that's all they hear. When you bring forth, uh, a non mainstream point of view or a controversial perspective, instead of considering the possibility, it almost immediately gets dismissed.

Speaker 4:          01:00:09       This climate change thing is another ideological struggle. Yeah, sure. Climate change is taking place, but what are the causes for this? You know, are we so sure that it's all caused by human beings? I would say there's very good reason for humanity to clean up our act in lots of ways. Regardless of the issue of climate change we're living, we're, we're abusing mother earth. We are living upon this planet, uh, like, like parasites and, and destroying it. We thoughtlessly create this gigantic pools of, of pollution where we're crazy enough, insane enough to actually invent nuclear weapons and you know, long periods of detonate that like of things, you know, this is the, the lots about our behavior that we need to fix because it's right to fix it philosophically, right? We should not behave that way. We should not behave that way to one another. We should not behave that way to planet earth. But to say that we need to fix our behavior because of global warming, that's an ideological argument. And that argument remains to be properly tested. Yes, global warming is occurring, but are we the cause of it or is something else, some, some grander scale cosmic effect involved in this?

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       We talked about that considerably. And I noticed in a lot of the comments from, from our last discussion, most of the critical comments where people, you know, not liking the idea that I had questioned the dogma of global warming, but there are some facts that you can't escape. No. The global warming again 200 years ago, and we see that the glaciers from the little ice age began to shrink back. And your early 19th century before there was, you know, a century before there was any significant human contract contribution of co two to the atmosphere. So something was driving that warming that began. And it's important to realize that the little ice age was probably the coldest period since the end of the great ice age. In fact, the data overwhelmingly supports that end that the glaciers grew to their largest extent around the planet and 10,000 years. So when we're talking about glacier recession, it's important to understand what the baseline is.

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       Our baseline in this case is the biggest, the glaciers have been in 10,000 years. And what's interesting, and this is going on right now, as the glaciers had been receding, geologists and biologists and and glaciologists and so forth have been studying, um, the landscapes that are being revealed as the ice shrinks back. And you know, what they're finding is the remains of forests that had been overrun by the Little Ice Age glaciers up, you know, and, and, and peat bogs and things that would suggest that prior to the onset of the little ice age, those valleys that were filled with ice from roughly 1400 to 1800, we're actually forested because the ice came down and overran these forests and now it's receding back and revealing that there were forests there. So that tells you that, you know, at some point, probably going back to the medieval warm period, those areas that were, that have been glaciated during the early part of the 20th century were actually free of ice.

Speaker 2:          01:03:10       And so, you know, the climate has been extremely dynamic. That's the thing we have to emphasize all by itself without any help from humans. And this is what I've been saying is that we have to look at that and realize it. Yeah, humans are a factor. You know, somebody I did post and said all the other factors I had mentioned as you know, ocean currents and wind currents and geomagnetic field and cosmic rays and volcanism and all that. It all been investigated in dismissed. And the only thing left was the human contribution. But you know, to me that's really, we're putting all our eggs in that basket and that could turn out to be very dangerous because we're so focused now on our own contribution that we might be overlooking the fact that there have been natural factors driving climate change over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          01:03:58       I mean, because I still have not heard any consensus on what has caused the planet to first go into an ice age and come back out of an ice age. And I think that would bring him and I are talking about actually presents a possible solution to what could have brought this planet out of the Ice Age. Something on a grand cosmic scale. And the other point I think I'd like to make is that we have to really to understand our planet as a system, we have to realize that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been a much bigger player in what's been going on down here than has been a previously understood or appreciated. And I think our ancestors probably did

Speaker 4:          01:04:40       Tuesday, they did understand it. They, the focus on the skies, if you go back into ancient times, is so strong. This notion of as above. So below that we are connected to the cosmos. This is, this is something that we are tending to forget in the modern world again because we're so puffed up with pride anywhere we can't see the sky if they live in sending a big issue. Collusion, it's just like a haze up there. We don't, we don't, we don't, we don't see anything. So we, we're actually cut off from the cosmos it psychologically. And that's a, that's a mistake because we are part of this giant cosmic environment and it affects us. And one of the way it affects us is the way that comments come into the inner solar system from to time, from deep space.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       I was camping in Montana recently and uh, you know when you're out at night and you look at that night sky and there's no light pollution. Yeah, it's just a totally different perspective and it gives you a different sense of where you are in the universe because we're so, and it's not a, it's not necessarily our fault. It's almost like we've put up a curtain over the heavens and we can't see through the curtain because we've decided that we like light and we like traffic lights and you know, building lights and all this jazz. And we don't realize until we're out in the woods or in the wild until you were in the wilderness and there's no light pollution, you really don't realize what we're missing and what we're sacrificing in order to have these lights. The view of the heavens. It's, it's so it's psychedelic in a way you back cause it makes you feel like, oh my God, we're really flying through space and nice.

Speaker 5:          01:06:09       That by the nature has provided us with those plots that really help us to appreciate it from him. I tried to go every year to the Keck observatory on the big island. I tried to schedule my a holidays as much as possible around the time where there's no moon because it is unbelievable because the Keck observatory is more than 9,000 feet above sea. If there's a visitor center and then there's the observatories above, but you really don't even know have to go past the visitor center. But they're, the way they have it set up, they have these special streetlights all throughout the pig island with diffused lighting. So it doesn't interfere. It doesn't give you light pollution and when you're up there, you're, you're, you go through the clouds and the view is insane. If it doesn't look real, it doesn't even look real. Like you see all the stars, you're like, this can't be real.

Speaker 5:          01:06:59       How could this be up there? Every day and we don't see it. But what we've done is create all this incredible stuff, these streets and buildings and laptops and cell phones and in the, in doing so we have robbed ourselves. Have a perspective. Yeah. It's weird because you know, we, we have this technology that enables us to go around the whole world and, and even go out into outer space. But actually we, in a way, it's narrowed our focus. We, we, we've, we focus in on the all the technology and its products and we forget about the majestic cosmic and earth environment in which we, in which we live, how sacred it is, how beautiful it is, how meaningful it is to all of us. And that was the image that our ancestors always had. That's probably why they concentrated on it so much. And the things that happened up there were evident to them. I mean, because these days, how many people see meteors living in an urban environment? You never see that hardly unless it's really spectacular. But you go out, like you said in Montana or the one of my favorite places to garden into high desert country and there you really, it's well the stars or how much you can reach out and touch him. You know, I think that one of the most important things that we could do for future generations is part of our educational curriculum for young people

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       is get them out of the cds into nature, into the tremendous, you know, where they can actually see the sky. Because I mean, I'm living in Atlanta, I'll talk to people, even grown up people that have have no clue. I have no clue. You know, you couldn't, they couldn't find the north star, they couldn't find the plane of the ecliptic if their life depended on it. They, you know, they're just, we've, we've become cut off from that level. And I think that that's, it's important for us to keep that because our consciousness is linked to this greater domain and, and we have segregated ourselves from that. And, and I think that there's something there, you know, amazingly, it's a, it's a grounding experience. When you get out in you, you begin to see the sky and you can actually, um, you know, begin to figure out in, in identify the constellations. Um, you know, to, to know where the planets are to, to look in the sky in, in

Speaker 4:          01:09:13       good mental exercise. It's something with anybody doing get to grips with all that up there as the ancients did, it gets your mind working. And it may even have been used deliberately for that purpose in ancient times. People kind of initiation system. If you can get this, then you move on to the, to the next level. You know, that's the, that's the, that's the kind of idea. It was a critical part of education where it's very rarely even discussed today. And look again at the ideology. So for example, if you talk about astrology to any most, any mainstream scientists, they're going to laugh in your face. And you've got to say pseudoscience because they're so locked into this earth centered perspective that which, which convinces them that the cosmos does have no effect on us. So how can changing patterns of the stars that that which is a dye called constellation is sitting behind the sign at a particular time.

Speaker 4:          01:10:03       How can that effect us? How can when we were born effect us? I don't think we should throw that baby out with the bath water too fast. I think we're looking at an ancient science with, uh, with astrology and I think it's worth it. It's been heavily diluted and prostituted in the modern world debate. But if you go back to the antiquity, you go back to the real origins of this and you start finding some very interesting information coming out. There's a fantastic book by a guy called Rick Tarnas called Cosmos and psyche and he's a real mainstream, a very major academic. And he's got into this and he's shown that actually, yeah, astrology does have effects. So we should not, we should not deny our cosmic environment. That's the first thing we need to do to connect to it. And we shouldn't close ourselves off to avenues of inquiry for ideological reasons. It's, it's noticeable in this field of ancient history how archeologists throw around words like pseudo archeologist or pseudo scientists. That's meant to be an instant dismissal just like climate deniers, climate denier. You call somebody a climate denier today. That's like saying, don't listen to anything that guy has to say, never listened to it. Again, these are ideological tools which are being used to straight jacket the human mind and to stop us thinking outside the box and if there's ever a time where we needed think outside the box.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       I would say that time is right now. Isn't it ironic that in this time of more information available to the average person than ever before, that this also has coincided with our lack of appreciation for what's above us. It's very strange that it's a very curious phenomenon. Here's an interesting perspective. You know, as we're talking about how dynamic the plan it is and how it's changed and how dramatically different which it is. I mean, if we go back to the end of the ice age, you know, you go east of here, a lot of the Mojave desert that was lush grasslands and forests, you out here to the Santa Rosa Islands, you know, out here they were all forested with oak trees and beech trees and, and uh, mammoth mammoth, this Exilis, which was the pygmy mammoth. You know, I mean, everything down here changes dramatically. But when we go out and we look at the sky, we're basically seeing the same sky that our ancestors have 20,000 years ago were looking at.

Speaker 1:          01:12:09       And that's something to keep in mind because there is something, there's a backdrop to all of this drama and change here below. That's pretty much for the most part, remained consistent. But within that backdrop of consistency, every once in a while something shifts. And when it shifts out there, I think our ancestors knew that there was a direct consequence here below. And that's one of the reasons they were so obsessed with, with being able to track motion. Um, you know, all of these ancient observatories from Stonehenge on down the line to, you know, the, the, the mountain structures here in North America. Let's not forget it. Go back to the Tempe. Profoundly astronomical science. Real Beckley Tepi yes, these were astronomical observatories using the horizon essentially as a telescope by which very intimate and intricate movements within that backdrop of fixed stars could actually be observed possibly for predictive capabilities.

Speaker 1:          01:13:05       And how are the calculations may like an archeologist finds a site like go Beverly, go, go Beckley. Tappy how do they correlate the construction of the site with the Constellation? Fist off, mo, most archaeologists don't, don't do that at all because they just don't do astronomy. They don't get it. They have their eyes are on the ground at their feet to the disciplines because astronomy is not relevant to them. They project that onto the past and imagined that it was not relevant to the past. And that's one of the big mistakes I think that it makes. There are people call dot Kao Astronomy's, uh, who are looking at the astronomy of ancient cultures. And some of them have done very good work. But really there, there are certain key indicators, um, eh, the alignment of the site, what's it pointing at and does that alignment change down the ages? Um, you can sometimes establish that a, that a particular access of a particular template in Egypt for example, was shifted over a period of two or 3000 years, several times. And why? Because they were tracking the changing rising point of the star Sirius, which they connected in their system of ideas to the goddess Isis. They were tracking that point which changes

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       because of changes in in the sky. I mean the long story short, the earth wobbles on its axis and that since the earth is our viewing platform from which we observe the stars, changes of orientation of the earth in space do change. The rising times of particular stars at particular times of year and, and a, this was clearly tracked by the ancient. So you can say that if you find anywhere a monument that is perfectly aligned to true north, south, east, and West, you can be absolutely sure that astronomers were involved. If it's tracking the rising sun on the spring equinox or on the winter or summer solstice, astronomers were there. They were right there when they met, they made that monument. Well, that's one of the scariest that we're not the scariest but most astounding things when you consider the ancients that they had an understanding of the procession of the equinoxes, which is what it was a 26,000 years.

Speaker 4:          01:15:00       So 26,000 year cycle, 25,920 years. How the very long, very precise observations and the motive to make those observations that this was important to them and they sought to pass down that importance to us. Um, very important work by two historians of science called Giorgio decentered, Yana and Hertha von Deshint back in the 60s they wrote a book called Hamlet's mill, which tracks this ancient knowledge of precession and they trace it back. And this was very politically uncorrect at that time because George has said, Alana, so the Santee Deanna was the professor of the history of science at Mit. They trace it back to what they call some almost unbelievable civilization of pre historic antiquity that made the subsidy. They found the data encoded in myths and traditions all around the world. And I do go into this in magicians of the gods. They, they found it encoded as though the data was so important that it had to be passed down to the future.

Speaker 4:          01:15:59       So the numbers that relate to precession of the equinoxes, and they're all based on the number 72 and multiples of that number. Why? Because it takes 72 years for one degree of processional change to unfold. And that's like holding your finger up to the horizon. That one degree is just that one finger width of change on the horizon. Very precise observations and needed to do it. It's encoded and miss and traditions. And it looks like somebody at some point decided this information is so important, we must make sure that it stays permanently in human culture. So what we're gonna do is we're going to encode it in great stories, and those stories can then be passed on by storytellers who will have an ethic that they must tell the story. True. It doesn't matter whether they understand the scientific information in the story or not.

Speaker 4:          01:16:47       All that matters is that they pass it on. And so in the oldest myths and traditions of mankind, we have compelling evidence for scientific knowledge of the phenomenon that we call the precession of the equinoxes today, which has been referred to by, by, um, in Hamlet's mill is the great year, a great year, which is the full cycle, 25,000, 920 years a great circle in the heavens. It's very evident if you've got thousands of years to watch. The Sky is very evident at the pole. Um, our Pollstar presently is Polaris, and that's just simply because the extended North Pole of the earth points most directly at that particular star in the sky. Uh, but it hasn't always pointed at Polaris because of the wobble on the axis of the earth. And it won't always point at Polaris in the future, the Pollstar changes, but you need to observe the skies for very long periods of time.

Speaker 4:          01:17:38       Keep detailed records to get to grips with this phenomenon. This debt therefore testifies to the fact that some ancient culture was doing this in a very systematic way. It's like a ghostly fingerprint of an advanced scientific knowledge impressed upon the oldest myths and traditions of our planet. Has it been six? I'm sorry. Is it it, has it been accepted that things like the Mayan temples were, were built to mirror the constellations cause that except it has been accepted? Yeah, it is. It is accepted because we know that the Maya where we're an astronomical culture and it is, it is accepted that they were building their, their, their temples in connection to the sky and the whole phenomenon of the Mayan calendar. Um, w which we all heard a lot about in, in, in 2012, uh, is, is another factor to take into account. The Mayan calendar, in my view, is another artifact of a lost civilization.

Speaker 4:          01:18:29       This is the, that was handed down from a former people perhaps to the all macs and then to the the, the Maya who who succeeded them. It's, it's accepted, but the implications of it are not, are not taken properly into account remembered 21st of December, 2012 there was all that fast and nonsense about the end of the world happening, happening then and, and it didn't. But that's my, I never said that. They said that the end of a great cycle happened then, which would ultimately transform the world, but what it was actually locked into, and I need to pay tribute to another researcher here and his name is John Major Jenkins. John Major Jenkins has done fantastic work on the Mayan calendar and decade before 2012 he was telling people, look, this is not talking about the end of the world on a specific day on the 21st of December, 2012 there's a, there's a calculation behind this.

Speaker 4:          01:19:20       And what he showed in that calculation is that it is the position of the winter solstice sun against the background of the constellations. And what has been happening for the last 5,000 years because of procession is that the Winter Solstice, Sun 21st of December, against the background of the constellations has been gradually shifting towards alignment with the center of the galaxy. And that alignment happened, uh, on the 21st of December, 2012 but it's not an instant, it's a window and that window is about 80 years wide, roughly from 1960 to 2040. That was what was focused on in the Mayan calendar. A calendar that can predict eclipses of the moon 200,000 years into the future, or 200,000 years into the past.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Incredible, stunning accuracy. A better estimate of the length of the solar year than we use today in our modern calculations. Really? Yeah. Wow. High Science and coated in that, in that calendar. Why don't we just adopt the Mayan calendar if it's better than what we have? I don't, yeah. We now living in the fifth stage of the world, according to the Mayan, the Mayan use may not have been. Yeah, it's probably not good for your iPhone. It wouldn't make a good app. I've got, they have a mine, I have mine calendar. I'm sure they do. You can think of one, one, one half of a degree. Graham said one degree every 72 years, right? One degree within degree ear is like one day out of the great year. Right? So you could think of 72 years as basically being a human life. So an average human life is roughly like a day of the great year.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       That's one way. One perspective. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No, what he said about the window is, because you can't define the center of the galaxy, would that an exact precise point? There's a diffuse area there and every 72 years, the, the, this, the spring point is moving one degree, which is twice the diameter of a full moon. Full Moon is a half a degree. Right. Okay. And I think that possibly one of the importances of monitoring, um, because you can't really, you know, you can't go out and look at the sun, you know, and say, okay, here's The sun relative to this backdrop of this constellation. However, you can look at, uh, a full lunar eclipse and then you, you will know that the sun is 180 degrees around. So by monitoring lunar eclipses, you can actually position the sun quite precisely and know where it is in the sky because obviously you can't go out and look at the sun and see what stars it's, it's related to, right, right.

Speaker 1:          01:22:05       But during a lunar eclipse, lunar eclipse, it's 180 degrees almost precisely on the other side of the earth from the, from the sun. So can, can I just jump in for a second because I have an image here. I don't know if we can get it on the tap. And it's this image on, on this side, it's a pillow with originally carved a shelling. Uh, is that pillar 1443 43 and enclosure day? Not I'm, I'm not going to go into it in detail and I've seen that online, but Jamie will find images online. I just want to, I just want to make the point and I go into this in this book, magicians of the Gods that, that that appears to be a diagram of the sky at the winter solstice in our epoch. This, this red, the round dots above the vultures wing, the round circle represents the sun. And what we're looking at is an ancient constellation diagram. The constellations that we call Sagittarius in school, Po, uh, stand on side

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       of the galactic center of the, of the dark rift at the heart of the Milky Way, which the Maya saw is the womb of cosmic rebirth. And it's precisely that image that is depicted there. Back it up chapter and verse in the book. You'll just have to take, so what we see the Scorpion below. Yeah, there's a, there's an ancient memory that there should be a scorpion in that area of the sky. And it's impressed here

Speaker 1:          01:23:26       on this, on this, on this pillar. And what are the other constellation clues?

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Well, the, the, up on the right, you'll see first of all, see the vulture with its wings outstretched and his son over the wing. Then go right up there, you'll see a bird. That's that small bird is actually the head of our constellation of Scorpio. The tail of our constellation of Scorpio overlaps the Scorpion a underneath the pillar, but go above the small bird and you'll see a serpent there, a snake, and beside it, another bird that looks like a penis. Villi. Those represent, we call those, we call those constellations today or futures, the serpent holder, which is the represented by the bird there. And we call the serpent constellation. So pants are there, other constellations are, are, are also involved. It, this is spooky and eerie because it appears there's overwhelming evidence that the people who made go Beckley Tapi had a profound knowledge of procession and it appears that they deliberately sent forward into time in this time capsule, a picture of the sky in our age.

Speaker 4:          01:24:33       And that is a staggering possibility that, uh, that I investigators 10 how it's in our age. Well, it's only at the winter solstice in our age that the sun sits over the center of the galaxy, the winter solstice in the area that the ancient Maya called the cosmic womb. There's a dark rift in the Milky Way at that point. And they saw that as the cosmic womb. So it symbolizes a moment of rebirth. And the evidence is that they'd been tracking the movement of the sun on the winter solstice, which is also the end of the year. And the rebirth of the new year. They'd been tracking it to the point where they could project forward and they could envisage the sky in our epoch today. The Meijer could do that. And what I'm suggesting is that's done correctly Tapi as well.

Speaker 1:          01:25:22       Well, it's very hard for me to interpret those. Uh, I'm seeing the vulture playing basketball and trying to get away from the Scorpion and there's a penis trying to attack them. And I'm not exactly sure that the photograph alone, that's just the best. Just the heart of the mystery. You have to get into the logic of it and compare it with the existing constellations. And I've tried to do that. Well it's also fascinating that all of these images were carved in three d relief. So instead of being what would that means is instead of being drawn like into like you know, people think about like wet cement, you can draw your name in wet cement instead of that what they've done is they've removed everything around it to create these images, which is a much more sophisticated is right. This is what's

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       called high high relief. Um, interestingly you can see at the top of the pillar there are three that look, things that looked like handbags, that symbol crops up all over the world. It crops up in Mexico, it crops up in Mesopotamia, crops up in India, everywhere. And again, I think we're looking at at symbolism that goes back to a very remote period, which we know is at least as old as 11th. And maybe what they're trying to say is that shopping will be the end of a saw. I think those bags held desk stash really, and I'm half serious because this is, this is another issue that that is ignored by the mainstream is the use of psychedelics in ancient civilizations was fundamental to the quality of those civilizations. And this is another area where in ideological denial about, because the powers that be in our society don't like psychedelics. They don't want ancient cultures to have liked the my there and they just ignore the evidence for that.

Speaker 5:          01:26:57       I think it's one of the main points of view that uh, when you don't consider them, it makes me really reluctant to listen to a lot of the other things you have to say because it's, it's undeniable the impact those things have on human consciousness. And it's also undeniable that many, many, many civilizations used them as a part of their spiritual rituals. And the fact that this is not thought of as an important aspect of our history. When it all it means to me is the people that are talking about and have an experience. Exactly. That's the policy only.

Speaker 4:          01:27:32       Yeah. Who are the, the, the entrusted with interpreting our past to us. Unfortunately, most of them had never taken a psychedelic in their life, so they don't know what they mean.

Speaker 5:          01:27:43       No, look, I just need 15 minutes of your time and one DM teaching 15 minutes and the whole thing will be so much clearer. How much

Speaker 4:          01:27:50       clearer exactly. It's, I think it's an important experience for archeologists to have because it was a universal experience in the ancient world. We demonize psychedelics today and we, we pretend that they are just totally negative things, but in the ancient world, they were revered and enshrined. They were at the heart of the ancient mysteries. The Eleusinian mysteries in ancient Greece used a potion related to Lsd, which brought about a revelation for the initiates, changed their lives just in the way that a powerful psychedelic trip can change our lives today. So just like writing about history and the origins of civilization without taking account of, whoops, this gigantic cataclysm that happened 12,800 years ago, that's a mistake that archaeology is making. The other mistake they're making is they're not considering the role of altered states of consciousness in ancient civilizations. Ideological Blinders ideologic keep us from looking at possibilities. I don't know whether or not that stash or that's just chicks handbag sang shopping malls, malls were ruined us all. That's the way. The thing is, the weird thing is that it's all that, that this symbolism is all over the world. What have got back Lee tabby was a mall. The, that's how you may have something back.

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       This symbolism of these purses. Yeah. Yeah. It's found on the web. For example. Um, we'd have to find a, an, an image, but there's a, the earliest image of the figure known as quite sal collateral in Mexico, uh, survives from, uh, the old Mech area of the Gulf of Mexico. And it was founded a site called love Venta, uh, along with a lot of other buried stone artifacts. And it shows a man sitting within the coils of a serpent and that serpent has a crest on its head because that's what quotes are. Collateral means it means a feathered serpent. And that man is holding one of those bags just the same as the Sumerian Fishman. Oh, Anis. The one adapta the the originator of civilization in Suma, ancient, ancient Sumeria. According to their mythology, he's always depicted holding one of these bags as well. So I find myself wondering, are we looking at the symbolism of some ancient brotherhood, you know, who passed around the world seeding civilizations and that this was the equivalent of their, I dunno, their masonic handshake or something.

Speaker 3:          01:30:12       This was their badge of recognition, this bag that they carried them. Well, it's just speculation, right? It's, it's fewer speculators thing. It's pure speculation, but so because of the fact that we, the, they've accepted that the mind temples are aligned with the constellations. Have they decided to look at other archeological discoveries in the same light or is it something are, there is a specialized subdivision of archeology, which is called archeo astronomers except this subdivision. These are, these are archeologists who have been trained in astronomy, but they've also been trained in the fundamental dogmas of the discipline of archeology, which is that there can be no lost civilization. That archeology has already told pretty much the full story of humanity and they're all the weights. All the weights is to fill in the details. This is, this is the dogma of archeology that is taken in from the moment that somebody decides to become an archeologist.

Speaker 3:          01:31:10       Part of the training, and actually if you try and go against that dogma as a mainstream archeologist, you can kiss goodbye to your career. Any archeologist who entertains the possibility of an advance lost civilization around the world more than 12,000 years ago will have no future as an archeologist. That right there, we'll write him off for the rest of his career. That's so disturbing. Disturbing. If that's true. That's so, it's so mind numbing cause why would you ever believe that we've got it all figured out where every day they find some new stuff. Did you see the discovery they found recently of a large tooth that's a cousin of a, of human beings then serve and re, but really recently within the last few days, very recently. Well, this is the thing you see the our, our story is much more complex that we've been taught and gradually by bit the evidence is coming out of the woodwork.

Speaker 3:          01:32:01       Well, the idea that we have all the data of history is just so crazy. It's just our true and arrogant. It's absolutely foolish. It's a very foolish idea and it, and it shuts us down to the, to the possibilities. I mean the universe gifted us with these giant brains and this incredible imagination and intuitive faculties as well. We not only rational creatures where we're intuitive creatures and all of these faculties should be applied to understanding the mystery of who and what we are. And I think that's one of the mistakes of modern science is there's just chopped out one bit that kind of alert problem solving, the rational reason, the use of reason and logic and it, and it's chopped out all the rest. The, the, the, the, the capacity of humanity to dream, to learn information and dream to learn, learn true knowledge in dream was revered in the ancient world and just ridiculed today.

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       You want to insult somebody called him a dreamer, you know, uh, things of things have changed so much. Well it seems like back then there was so much less information. Now there's so much information to call someone. A dreamer means that you're, you're thinking of nonsense when you should be trying to acquire all the information that we've already discovered that we've already cumulated. Exactly. That's exactly what it's about. And again, it's, it's ideology. It's saying that there is nothing of value and dreams. How do we know that ancient world felt that there was useful knowledge to be got from, from dreams, not all dreams. It's in homer actually, the speaks of the gate of ivory and the gate of Horn. Some dreams come through the gate of ivory. They're just pleasant fictions or maybe unpleasant ones. Nightmares, ignore them. They're not important. But others are true.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       Tellings and they come through the gate of Horn. Uh, and, and this was a recognized factor in the ancient world. We've dismissed it today. It's regarded as pseudoscience. It's regarded as nonsense. Again, that label is constantly applied to anything. Archaeologists don't alike. Pseudoscience. D right there with a label. They just dismiss everything. They always call me a pseudo scientists, which means a false scientist. And I find that bizarre because I'm not a scientist at all. I've never claimed to be a scientist. I don't want to be a scientist. I'm a writer. I'm a journalist. I, I synthesize material across a broad range of disciplines. So how can I be a false scientist since I've never claimed to be one. But the word is used as a bludgeon or a club to beat an enemy over the head and ensured that nobody listens to what that enemy centers sort of a bulletproof pejorative.

Speaker 3:          01:34:23       You know, you throw that out there and you're immediately dismissed. Yeah. But it's got to be satisfying to you going from that original book, which I became absolutely fascinated by fingerprints of the gods to or slowly but surely over time, more and more evidence being discovered in mainstream science, in archeology that affirms all these suspicions. And then, uh, attached to what Randall has been studying his whole life. It really, the whole thing just sort of unfolds in front of your eyes. There's a, there's a kind of perfect perfect moment in human knowledge unfolding right now.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       We now have the knowledge of this giant cataclysm that happened 12,800 years ago, which has just not been taken into account at all up to now and at the same time and it's almost eerie. Archaeological sites are popping up all around the world that cannot be explained by the previous model of history.

Speaker 5:          01:35:17       Now with all of this information that you've shown so far, the the, the, the, the layer that shows the massive burning of the forest, the impact craters that we've found, the nuclear glass, the micro diamonds, all this evidence that the, in an immediate shift of the climate, the mass extinction of a huge percentage of the large mammals is the impact period. That period. Is that considered in mainstream science, mainstream

Speaker 4:          01:35:52       science because it's mainstream scientists who've presented the evidence, as I said, data that you've accumulated in correspond comes from right from mainstream science published in, in the absolute leading scientific journals, but you're stitching it together. What, what nobody has done yet. I think I'm probably the first person to do it, is to take that evidence and consider its implications for the stories we tell ourselves about the origins of civilization. Very important story. Where did civilization come from? What is it? And that information has not been taken into account at all by archeologists yet I hope they will do so in the future. They need to play a very fast game of catch up to catch up with the science on this and take it into account. But right now it's not being taken into account at all. You will not find a single archaeological document which takes account of the cataclysm that happened between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:36:45       Big Part of the problem is specialization in science. I think. So you've got, um, you know, uh, paleontologists looking at the extinction of ants. You've got marine geologist looking at sea level rise. You've got glaciologists looking at how the glaciers disappeared and we're in a position now where we need to begin synthesizing all this it, you know what's interesting to me though is that it, it really, it almost falls on the shoulders of the Mavericks, you know, the synthesizers and that's kind of really right now there's so much specialization in science that the next phase of it I think is beginning to integrate it. It takes to create a coherent model of our past because a lot of like grandma's saying, a lot of the mainstream scientists have this information, right? If I, if, if we look at this graph right here and you see how this compares with, um, the graphs we just saw of the climate changes and the ocean level rise, this is a, as it says, Lake place to see mortality graph.

Speaker 2:          01:37:46       And this is basically looking at radiocarbon dated a fossilized remains of the extinct mammals. And if you look carefully, you'll see that within the range that we're talking about writing here, here's your 13,000 year spike right here. This is exactly the same time period. And yeah, exactly the same as the changing of the temperature, the rising of the sea levels, massive extinction event, right, and narratives right there. Every one of these squares represents a fossilized remain. I think the 360 or 70 specimens that have been dated, it seems insanely unlikely to me that this didn't correspond with an impact on human civilization. It's very, it's very clear that it's a sense, it seems insane, but it's not like mainstream and consuming. If this is all fact, and obviously it is,

Speaker 3:          01:38:40       how is this not like how hasn't it, this is so glaring for something happen. It raises a horrible possibility for archaeology, but they have been completely wrong about the origins of civilization. I mean not just slightly wrong but completely wrong because they didn't take account of this. That's a horrible possibility and it's much better to just try and get rid of the data. I'm not saying that it's a conspiracy by archaeologists. I'm saying it's human nature. If you're invested in a system of ideas so powerfully invested in it, that your own personality is connected to you just can't accept it. It's really hard to accept almost your generation has to die off before a new generation comes that will be prepared to it. It was just with old age, I'm not threatening and assault on Ooh, because it empowered. I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:31       And, and, and that's, I think that's the problem why it's not been taken and Randall's right. The other problem is the intense specialization of our society. That's one of the strengths of our society. There's also one of the weaknesses or society that everybody's really good at. One particular thing. That's the only way it all works out because how one could possibly get all of this work done and it's all we're all into dependent upon upon one another. But there's not enough comparing notes across the disciplines. And I guess that's where my skills such as they are come in that I can, I've spent my whole life synthesizing data from, from many different fields. And that's what, um, that's, that's, that's what I'm doing here. And it also, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a part of the issue is there's no consequence to not considering this stuff. There's no consequence to just ignoring it. They ignore it. They team teach what they've taught mainstream and they still come out smelling like a rose and everything looks great. Exactly, and they, and they all keep their jobs. They don't annoy that colleagues. It's almost the opposite of that because

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       to go here, they're actually, you know, they're threatening your position. You know, they're, they're, they're putting their position in danger, but I don't understand why they would be because to me it seems like you would want to say, we have some exciting

Speaker 3:          01:40:42       hi data. So this is, well now we have to reconsider what we already know. We already know, you know, about this part of the world and this was a, we'd already know about the pleistocene era. We already know about all these different houses, but now we have this new data to consider and hear all it is. They should be excited about it. They should be joyous, that there's, this is something here, which really could change the whole picture. But that's not the case. It's, it's, it's radically opposed. Well it just, it makes your education look like shit. I mean it's really unfortunate, but it really does see this is an area that Randall and I happen to know a lot about. What I wonder is in other areas that I don't know about is this same phenomenon at work, that kind of knowledge filter, which is just shutting us off from what discipline would that be?

Speaker 3:          01:41:29       Or are you just social, social sciences, any, any, any area of science, a medicine, how things are to be done with, with medicine, how tumors are to be handled and dealt with. You know, we have, we have a dog my right now that it's chemotherapy and radiotherapy and, and every other system is, is regarded as what pseudoscience generally. But maybe that's a mistake. You know, maybe we should be considering the possibility of these alternative therapies. Maybe they're better than blasting somebody with highly radioactive material. Well, I certainly think there's some, there's some things that we don't know about the impact of nutrition and overall health and meditation and just the impact of stress and wellbeing and how it plays on health factors. And I think we're going to learn all that. I mean I think there's probably more discussion and more uh, more focus on that then there is on stuff like this, this sure, sure.

Speaker 3:          01:42:24       There is. Our personal health is important to all of this and, and this is kind of a part of our personal health because it's a part of our understanding of the we, our environment that we exist in, where we are, where we came from. Yeah, absolutely. Now you got, how long did you guys rode trip together? It's about two weeks. Wasn't it? Run a little shy of two weeks. And what, what did, what did it entail? Did you guys make a video of it or anything? There was a lot of videos shot. Beautiful. One of one of rentals colleagues, Brad, who was with us shut video along the way and my wife's Santha took photographs and you know, we've put, we've, we've documented all of this very, very, very, very thoroughly. But it was an amazing road trip for me. It was the first time, actually I've, I've driven a great distance across the continental United States.

Speaker 3:          01:43:07       I've always been in this city or that city and picking up an airplane and going here, there, but actually drive across this incredible majestic land was, it was an enormous experience for me and it made me, it filled me with a sense of just how huge America is. I live in this tiny island, you know, Britain, but this giant, these open, they open skies country that they think they call it in there. It was, it was a great initiation into, into a beautiful part of North America and a mysterious part of North America. And it was great to do it with Randall because he's been walking the walk in this, in this area for decades. And he knows that landscape like the back of his hand. And for people that are listening to this podcast right now. And this is your first introduction to Randall and Graham. You gotta go pause right now

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       and go back to the first one. Grandma's on the first one. Randall was on and just do a binge, just binge lists and our binge watch. What are we looking at here? Well, this is Graham. I'm trespassing. How dare you can, I'm like, I'm watching it all directions first and be there. Well, since the, since the first time I was there at this is grammar actually referred to this erratic earlier. Um, this was one of those, that 18,000 ton boulder sitting above what not. So that was the boulder that was pushed by the wind, carried in ice and ice chained in an ice burg. So this massive rush of water had a giant rocks embedded in the iceberg to float that you need an ice bag about the size of an oil tanker. And this is, this is sitting 400 feet above the Modern Day Columbia. So we know that the water was at least this height.

Speaker 1:          01:44:47       Well, actually it had to been higher than this because 90% of the iceberg is under the surface of the water. And how do we know that this rock just wasn't there? How do we know that it was carried by this? Well, because it's not part of the bedrock. It's sitting on top of the land surface. Like all of these. If we look here, we've got some, some other, do we know where it came from? Do we know how far away it or originate? It's probably come from about 50 miles to 75 miles north of here. It's, it's the type of basalt it is, is, is, has been identified. I don't remember specifically, but when you travel over this land, you see these giant boulders just strewn about as a place called bolded puck. It's a tourist attraction now. You want to see it? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:45:32       And you can see there, I mean the size of that in there. Let's see. Oh my God. Yeah. So they just stand out like out of nowhere. Yeah. And we, we know this had to have been transported a board, an iceberg for the simple reason that if it was carried within the glacier mass, like a typical glacier erratic, you wouldn't have those sharp square corners like that. A glacier. It gets ground off and oftentimes, and this thing was transported almost 200 miles from its likely origin was Mount Robeson and we didn't get to this one, but this is evidence that the, the flooding was much more extensive than just the Missoula right flooding because this is the Missoula flooding that we were looking at was on the west side of the North American continental vice. You just jump in there and say that it isn't any longer controversial, that there was gigantic flooding in the Pacific northwest and then indeed across the whole range, just south of the ice cap, that that is accepted now. But the very idea that there was flooding a toll was hotly opposed for for decades. There was a great American geologist called j Holland brats who was the first to document the fact that there had been colossal flooding in that area and he lived in the 19 hundreds had 19 1920s and he suggested

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       that there had been a cataclysm. Of course, he was exiled by his colleagues. Eventually his data prevailed and he was awarded the Penn Rose Metal, the highest award of the Geological Glg in America in 1976 when he was like 96 years old, I must have sucked for. And he said, then he said, he said, all my enemies are dead, so I have no one left to gloat over what is so disturbing to me that it works like that. It works like that. But what happened, you see was Harlan. Brett's was convinced from the beginning that he was dealing, and this is a very experienced field, geologists, that he was dealing with a single humongous flood which had risen and fallen within perhaps two weeks. That was his evidence on the ground and he was attacked because people kept saying, well, where did the water come from? You know what's the source of this water?

Speaker 4:          01:47:40       And he said, that's not my problem. I am showing you the clear unmistakable evidence of flooding on the ground. Flooding happened. Somebody else go work out where the water came from and this stuck the whole argument for the best part of 40 years until a compromise was reached. And that's the word that Randall used. Missoula, they said that this flooding was caused by outburst floods from a glacial lake that's referred to as Glacial Lake Missoula. And because the flooding is so extensive, it must have outburst 80 or 90 times to cause to cause that flooding, which completely contradicts Highland. Brett's his view that it was a two week flood, one single event, but the compromise was accepted that the cause of the flooding was glacial Lake Missoula. That is now going to have to be reviewed because of the comet evidence. If Harlan Brett's of Jay Harlan breads had had the information we have today, he would have known instantly what caused that single humongous flood and that was the liquid dicing have a huge area of the North American ice cap instantly. And the floods that followed. It's so fascinating that the, the obsessions of a few people come together like this. And you can kind of piece these things together on a podcast. We're on a, what does this crazy imagery.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       We out of a 19th century text when catastrophism before catastrophism had been completely exorcised from mainstream geology and this was, um, uh, Louis figure I think was his name, who speculated that the, that the ice sheets over Northwestern Europe had catastrophic. He melted down and he had an illustration in his geology text, which perfectly captures how these larger radix are actually being transported. A board, these icebergs. And you can see the scale of the thing and this is the kind of, you see a whole forests are about to be washed away here. And this, this, this image. When the first time I saw it, I thought, well, here it is. This, this depicts the kind of field evidence that we, we've been looking at here. Um, so that's why I've included it here because it helps to visualize what we're talking about. Um, we've got some intro.

Speaker 2:          01:49:46       This was a place that, and I visited here, which really spectacularly embodies this whole phenomena. This is known as as dry faults cataract and it's about five miles wide and I'm going to show you the ground photographs and a couple of aerial photographs of it. She can kind of get the scale of the thing. Now this was the thing is anybody can go there. This is, this is on the lab hours to look at. We won't go and see this amazing trip to see it. You could go there, Joe. They would let you in there to see this. Where were you trespassing on that particular shot? That that's huge. 18,000 ton boulder has is surrounded by notices. We say no trespassing.

Speaker 2:          01:50:27       I trespassed, I mean the thing is made at Bass Hall and my footstep is not going to do any harm. Yeah, I bet nobody even noticed the Graham had been up there, so it's not like a private property issue. It's like they're just trying to keep people. I think it is actually a private pro probably. Yes. Because I have noticed from the first time I went there, which was, gosh, I don't know, 98, I think there was no houses on that hillside. Now the houses are moving up the hill side spent development and so forth. There was houses pretty much right around it. So we're going to overrun it and there'll be no evidence you guys get to accumulate your evidence. Why he came for condos go up there. So that's awesome. Right now, no. You'll notice these, there's a series of these alcoves here that, that you know, these, these horseshoe shape on the image of dry falls back on the image of dry false.

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       Exactly. And, and at some point somebody is going to be able to see these images, right? Yeah. Well people could go and Google them online, but they'll see them right now on youtube if they watched the youtube versus tube. Okay. So here's a typical horseshoe falls of Niagara, which is, which is a modern, uh, cataract, receding cataract. And this, this horseshoe shape is very typical of the way water will erode bedrock because water flows faster in the middle of the stream. Therefore it roads faster in the middle and not so much as you get towards the margins. And so it creates this classic horseshoe shape profile. And that's what we're seeing here at dry falls. Now this is just one of the alcoves of about half a dozen of the alcoves that we saw in the map of it. How the words, this is a monstrously big waterfall.

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       Yes. Now try today, just off to the left of the picture is where I'm actually in. There's a photograph in Graham's book taken, um, from, let's go back. We skipped over it. There it is. This is the viewpoint and this is horseshoe falls of Niagara superimposed on dry fall. She can get a sense of the scale. So Niagara Falls is a tiny, tiny little thing by comparison with this ancient fossilized waterfall, which dates back 12,000, 800 years. Niagara Falls is the result of 12,000 or more years of work of the river. Dry falls between upper and lower at grand coulee in Washington state is the result of two weeks of flooding. What? Yeah. And for people, look, he's trying to explain this for people that are, because

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       it's, it's probably 10 times bigger plus more than that. How many, how many times? It's two and a half times as high and well figure this, the, the discharge over of the Niagara River over the falls is a couple of hundred thousand cubic feet per second maximum. The discharge over Grand Cooley was somewhere between 300 and 400 million cubic feet per second or another words somewhere between 10 and 20 times the combined flow of every river on earth flowing all at once. And the height of this scarf face here, this cliff is about 400 feet. The water coming over was about 400 feet deep. So if you are here, visualize seat witnessing this at the peak of the flood, you wouldn't in fact even see a waterfall. What you would see is this massive 10 mile wide turgid river choked with icebergs and debris and whole forest river flowing at what? 60 70 miles an hour, 60 70 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:53:45       What you would've seen here was just a bump in this flood and then only at the latter stages of it where did actually have been a waterfall as the, as the water source was dissipating and as the water was declining, you would have the final stage of it being a waterfall. Then eventually the waterfall stopped. And what you have today is this fossilized feature of this massive, and this is only one of about a half a dozen comparable sized cataracts. We didn't get to see potholes or Frenchmen Cooley next time perhaps I did a j anybody listening to this, if he can do so, get up to Washington state and go visit upper and lower at grand coulee. It's as a stunning, stunning landscape is a great trip to make. And, and, and you can see the evidence on the, on the ground and you know, people don't know about, you know, we've got like here, this is Utah.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       And what you see here is once you begin to understand the cataract formation and, and you understand the morphology of a cataract, you're looking at something like this in which we're looking at is cataracts extinct, cataracts out in Canyon Lands, Utah and they're massively scaled. But no geologists. See, here's the problem. Geologists haven't been focused on catastrophism what they've been doing. They worked for the government, they worked for the oil companies. They, they're more interested in what's down below that. The match will gas the oil and stuff. There's another point, there's another point I'd like to add to that, Randall, as to why geologists and not a focused on catastrophes. Uh, geology is a science and science in effect defined itself as being different from religious superstition. So the notion of the great flood that we find in the Bible became a very discredited notion in science and, and the bye bye bye bye association with any suggestion of a great cataclysm in the past was seen as superstitious behavior to be completely

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       by the squeaky clean, shiny new sciences who must never take that into account. So any geologist good dares to propose. A cataclysmic episode is up against that right away that his colleagues don't want to go there because they're afraid that they're going to be accused of buying into Noah's flood or whatever. That's so unfortunate, but it's true and, and this is the, this is the problem. So there's, there's catastrophism and uniformitarianism and the prevailing dogma in geology is the uniformitarian dogma, which is basically to say the way we see things in the world today. That's how it's always been. It's never been any change.

Speaker 2:          01:56:19       So random. What is the mainstream understanding of those, those, those formations? Like what? When they look at those, the Utah ones, for example, gigantic Utah. I have searched and searched and I find nothing. They just don't explain it. They don't explain skull. Oh look, how pretty do you think of the flooding went as far South as Utah? Not directly glacial. I think what we're looking there, it has to be torrential rain. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:56:43       Which was, which is another association of this, of this impact picture. This huge impacts on the ice cap. An enormous amount of, of watery material is thrown up into the, into the atmosphere, not only water, but also mud and, and you get this rain out, which comes down for a long period after that.

Speaker 2:          01:57:03       And I'm not necessarily saying that all of that was stripped in one event because the place to seen is basically two and a half million years, two point I think 2.6 million is the latest dating of it. And there's been probably a dozen or two dozen ice ages that have come and gone. To me, the evidence I'm seeing suggests that the transition from glacial to interglacial and back again is not a smooth process. In fact, it's probably highly catastrophic, um, not necessarily as catastrophic as the event we're talking about 12,000, 800 years ago, but certainly catastrophic enough that we're an event of equivalent magnitude to happen today. We could maybe not cause a mass extinction, but we could certainly pull the plug on modern civilization. Um, and so this, this picture is interesting because what it does is it, it, it shows that, you know, you travel over the, this landscape.

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       Explain them what this picture is and where's the cake? You know, now this is, um, this is in, uh, western Montana and this is place called dry creek. And what this is, is just a gravel pit. But what you see here is deposits caused by searching floodwaters moving up tributary valleys loaded with sediment. And one of the things that is stratego for a sedimentologist looks at is you notice how they're tilted. You see how the, the, the layers are tilted, okay? That's an indication of which direction the water is moving. The tilting goes down in the direction that the water is flowing. So what we see here is massive

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       turbulent sediment laden floodwaters back flooding up a valley, surging, leaving deposits, and then flowing back out, followed by another wave, followed by another wave for now, for 13,000 years, 12,000 years, this material has been laying there and you see that there's forests growing over it, okay? People traveling over this landscape don't see what's under their feet, you see? But once you get an outcrop like this and you understand and you can read what you're seeing here, then suddenly it becomes apparent that the, that the very hills and landscape, that work that we live on, that we've built our cities on and our highways and that were playing out all these dramas that right under our feet is the evidence of previous worlds. You have to understand that what you're looking at there is the debris of a former world that was pulverized by these floods carried in and deposited and now a new world has emerged out of that.

Speaker 1:          01:59:46       And on top of this wreckage does room forma world existed, I believe on advanced civilization. That is memoralized and myths and traditions all around the world that is being ridiculed by archeologists, but it is insistent and the evidence keeps on coming forward. Well, it all makes sense. It really does. It's, it's all shocking and stunning and fantastic, but it all makes sense. I think it does make sense. And, and, and I think it's, it's, it's something as part of the human heritage, it's something that we all have to get to grips with. Again, this is one of the things I find in encouraging about developments in the world today is that more and more people do appear to be thinking for themselves. You know, that there was a time when we, we took the word of specialists, Dr [inaudible] or professor, why said this had to be true.

Speaker 1:          02:00:39       Uh, that was so actually when I wrote fingerprints of the Gods in 1995, that was the first argument was the argument from authority. The authorities say, this cannot be so therefore it does not sell. And a lot of people just just bolt that. What's changed, I think in the last 20 years is that, that, that, that, um, subservience to authority has gone away. It hasn't gone away completely, but we don't trust authority anymore, rightly and properly because we've been lied to by authority figures. And we know they lied to us and we saw the evidence, whether it's politicians or big corporations, you know what the big religions, the, the, there's a, there's an uprising against this and an assertion of individual will and, and, and have individual intellect to inquire into the past. And I think that that's why this, this information now has, uh, is, is coming at a time where it's falling on, on fertile ground.

Speaker 1:          02:01:29       There will still be a lot of resistance to it. We can expect that resistance to be fearless and to go on, but things are shifting in the world just as our picture of the past is shifting. So our picture of who we are and what we're meant to be doing here is shifting as well. Have you guys thought about coming together and doing a documentary? I'd love to do a documentary around it. Do you guys together? It's a must do. I mean, it just seems like the book is, I'm sure going to be fantastic, but there's going to be people that are just not going to read a book and documentaries are so easy or you just do is open your stupid mouth, lay down, you know, turn on Netflix and Bam, you know, you can absorb it. It's highly visual material and it's visual and it's just what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          02:02:12       It's so visual and the two of you together, we need a crowdfund something. Can I make an appeal? It's the first time I've ever done this. It's a kind of loose ditch. It's a little pitch. Okay. I've never asked for this before, but what I'm, what I'm asking to those who value and appreciate my work and feel that I'm doing something useful in the world, please support my work by getting this book because that is the best way to put one finger up to the mainstream. Archeology wants this book to go away. They want it to be forgotten. It will never be reviewed in any mainstream newspaper. It will never be written about. There will be no articles about it and probably know television coverage either. The only thing that can make the difference is people voting with their feet and um, I'm asking that now are people that thought in my work, people are huge, huge fans of your appearance is here and huge, huge fans of your work and if this is, this is the latest and greatest, I'm sure people are going to go out and buy in droves, so magicians of the gods and get it on Amazon.

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       You can get it on your website and get it pretty much everywhere that I go to my website and all the, all the links and the whole, the whole background on the on on the book is there. I, I hugely appreciate, deeply appreciate the support that my readers have given me. I would be nothing without my readers. And that's why every time I do an event, I sit there for two to three hours afterwards talking to people and signing books because the readers are the most important people in my, in, in my, in my universe. And there, there Wa there who give me strength without, without my readers. I'm literally nothing and I value and appreciate them. And I'm on a journey across America now and I'm speaking in many, many different cities and the whole program is up on my website, on the talks and events page and make sure we tweaked that stuff and get that information now.

Speaker 1:          02:03:54       And I'll get that information out for the entirety of the time you're here. Just let me know where you're going to be and I'll let everybody know when you're going to be there. Since we're plugging, I'd like to plug, I got this. What is that? Well, it's a a about a four and a half hour presentation. Of course, loads of graphics, um, radio clips, animations, and it's all you. Yeah. And what does it, was it called cosmic patterns and cycles of catastrophe? Well, we can go go to the sacred geometry international website, or I think Cameron wheelchair who you're Novak who introduced us, um, has a, I think he's doing a special on it. No. Okay. 33% off or something. What does the actual URL of the website? Well, it would be sacred geometry, international.com. There it is. Jamie's pulled it up right there. So cosmic patterns and cycles of Catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          02:04:49       Yes. 33.33% off. What does that all about? Don't have to ask Cameron about that and some, some hidden numerology in there somewhere apparently. And you'll notice coupon code magicians. Ah, there you go. Magicians of the gods must be a reference. I think it'd probably corresponds. Um, so I, I really think that you guys have to do one of these things together as a documentary. I mean, I think it's just, I think someone out there, someone's listening to this, probably some kooks that we don't want doing this documentary, but there's gotta be somebody out there that's legit when you need to find them and put it together. Yeah. I wanted to pay tribute to Randall's work, right. Rent. Randall is really important figure in this field. And he's very, he's very modest and he's been standing back and, and you know, he's not, not been out there enough.

Speaker 1:          02:05:37       It's time that people understood the fantastic knowledge that this man has and they, the, the ground experience. You can't beat that. Well, I met Randall in cows early two thousands, right? I, well, when, when you were at the punchline. Yeah. And Atlanta, which doesn't even exist anymore. 10 years ago, I think it was, it was quite awhile ago. And, uh, we had this conversation after my show and he's, we were just sitting there talking to me about the Holocene and all of these different impacts. And I remember walking away from it. We talked for quite a while after the show, but I remember going, that might be the craziest fucking post show conversation I've ever had because usually, you know, after a comedy show you have a conversation with people, you know, hey, where's a good place to eat? You know, a, if you do, you like Atlanta, you know, normal stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:06:24       And he's just flooding me with information. I'm like, who is this guy? Well, I remember walking away from it going, wow, I had no idea that Joe Rogan really related to all this stuff, you know? Oh, I was fascinated. I was surprised something there, which is I'd like to say something about you, Joe. Um, it's a phenomenon. I traveled all around the world and I give presentations in, in just countries everywhere and everywhere I go, people come up to me and they said, Joe Rogan sent this to you. We know about your work because of, because of Joe Rogan. And I see that what you're doing is exploring many, many controversial areas in your, in your show, you're in a position of power and your listeners, just as my readers on my strength, your listeners or your strength, they've put you in a position of power, but you're a person who's using that power for something really good. There are so many people who are powerful in the world of the media who just wasted away on Trivia and nothing. You are bringing new information to people all around the world. And I can tell you, cause I meet them every time I give an event. You are enormously appreciated. Well I appreciate them very much and I appreciate you guys and I appreciate this show because this, this whole thing came about without any planning.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       This show just sort of became itself. It's almost like I was a, I would just happen to be there to germinate it or something. I just tried to get out of my own way as much as possible and follow my curiosity. And the beautiful thing about people like you guys is without you take away you and fingerprints of the gods takeaway you. And what are we looking at? I mean is it's very rare when you have two human beings that without them an entire field of study would be barren of a great deal of its information. I mean you have John Anthony West and Robert Schoch who, and you were obviously a part of all that. And John Anthony West who's absolutely fascinating, fascinating guy and another guy. Why did Lima line a guy who's ignored but magical Egypt is one of the greatest DVD series to this day that I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 5:          02:08:30       And if you've got the time and the attention span to sit down and watch all of them, it is amazing. Amazing. John Anthony West is one of my favorite people on the plant. He's incredibly brilliant researcher. John more than anybody else who opened my mind to the mysteries of ancient Egypt. Fantastic work. And he's a world treasure. He is a will treasure. He's a great, great, great man. And I think that DVD series is, uh, is just one pedal when unfolding of the great flower of information that you guys are presenting. And I think, and another name, I'll drop it in there, which is Robert Bovard. They originated. Yeah, Ron Gosh. He's done so much to bring back attention to the importance of the skies and the HR world and what it means for our understanding of our past. And again, his evidence also points back to this period of 12,800 years ago.

Speaker 5:          02:09:19       And while we're at it, Robert Schoch early stock stuck his neck out from Boston University and really one of the first mainstream scholars that went out on a limb and said, we are absolutely looking at water erosion. Robert Shuck is a key figure in this field. He's very courageous to have to, to be a mainstream academic, to be a professor of geology at Boston. It was John West who introduced Robert Schoch to the notion that the Sphinx might be much older, that the weathering on it didn't fit with the, with the picture of history at John took Robert Shuck to Egypt and Robert Shuck went with the data and he stuck his neck out and he's taken a lot of criticisms and tax for it. But he's a very, very important player in this field. Well, all of you guys are just massively, massively important and this is such a unique and satisfying object of curiosity for me at least when when I start thinking about these things, it's almost like little things start firing off in my brain. It's so, it's so exciting. I mean it's horrific to think about the poor people that lived back then that got hit by these massive impacts and the the, the, this, the, the aftermath of it all. It must've been insane. But to think about now in 2015 the slow unveiling of all of this data and information and he has you as it all gets into focus

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       and you try to get a clearer and clearer view of what could have possibly happened in the past. I find it so incredibly enriching and fascinating to me. One of the most exciting aspects of, of the the, there's the potential of archeology. Yeah. Just to, to be able to discover like, oh, that's what happened. Ah, kind of Aha moment. Suddenly the pieces fall into place and we understand what we forgot and again, it's cement. That statement that you made that resonated with me that we are a civilization with amnesia. We just knocked on the head and we lost a lot. I lost a lot of them, but there is that haunting sense of incompleteness within, within so many of us that comes from that loss of memory. I feel like any amnesiac has a sense of something missing whole species. How that, I think what makes this really so potent

Speaker 2:          02:11:25       is the fact that there are considerable implications for our own future. Oh, absolutely. You know how Graham wraps up the book really is, is about our future, you know, and, and once, now that we've integrated this information into our world view, you know, what does it imply in terms of, of where we go from here because one of the things that I track and if you could shut the, throw this up on a screen for just a second, I'm going to speed through something really quick here so that you can kind of get the impression 1989, 1989. Let me get, um, let me just, you

Speaker 1:          02:12:03       giant asteroid Mace, close call by Earl Randall's fixing that. Let's also, let's also remind that we had a close, relatively close pass with a half kilometer wide, actually bit of a comet, uh, just over Halloween. Um, and the interesting thing is that NASA only found that object on the 10th of October and it okay, it missed us. It passed about the distance of the moon from the earth. That's not that far. That's not that far. But the key thing is, the key thing is that they only found it a few days before it passed. And how many other objects are out and about half a kilometer wide hospital over to why? So the one that hit tongue goose car was 100 meters to tiny. This is a minimum, a minimum of 150 to 200 times the volume of turn goose. And when you look at the universe and just look at our galaxy, the size of our galaxy, and look at our solar system, the size of our solar system, that is literally like getting grazed by a bullet. It's like getting great. Absolutely. That's a good analogy is a really good analogy. When you think about it, you know, you'd say, well, a half a kilometer

Speaker 2:          02:13:15       compared to the earth, that's not big. But like when you know, you think, think of a, a slug from, uh, from uh, uh, 32, right? If I threw it at you and hit you with it, it wouldn't do much. But if I accelerate it to a thousand feet per second, it's going to cause extreme trauma, right?

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       But now we're looking at these asteroids flying and comment debris and there 10 times, 20 times the speed of a rifle bullet when they hit our atmosphere like you know, 50 60 70,000 miles per hour and the the, the kinetic punch of something like that is inconceivable. It's like Graham said, I mean to talk about it, you'd have to take our entire nuclear arsenal of, of the peak of the Cold War, detonate it all at once and even that would only be a fraction of the forces unleashed. Nope. No. Watch this. I'm going to go through this real, real quick here and you'll get the idea, I think, um, that we're, we're at, because astronomers are looking out into our cosmic environment and this is what they're seeing. Look at this lights only back here is most of us are listening. Nine objects have come close to the earth since 1991.

Speaker 1:          02:14:27       Right? Current pre read that asteroid estimates are too low. This was October of 2000 current predictions for the number of potentially dangerous, sorry. Dangerous Asteroids have been underestimated by at least 20% say astronomers according to re recent calculations there between 750 and 900 asteroids. Let me circling the earth. That number has changed. That reports from October, 2000 we're now looking at the estimates and now that it's 100,000, uh, potentially earth destroying objects that are on earth crossing orbits. This isn't, this is an estimate. The problem is NASA has only identified a tiny fraction of what's out there. And again, I'm not saying this cause I want to spread gloom and doom. I'm saying this, I'm saying this because we have the capacity to do something about it, right? It takes goodwill on the part of the human race to stop wasting money on stupid, stupid pursuits, particularly warfare.

Speaker 1:          02:15:23       And to apply that resource, those resources to sweeping, clean our cosmic environment, the technology already exists. It's going to cause a, I mean it's going to have to be, there's going to have to be a massive shift in our attention. Like there has to almost be an event that takes place that makes people wake up. Right. We have world asteroid day right now. Some prominent figures in behind it, like Brian May, I think it was one of the guitarists with Queen, if I remember correctly. There's, there's a there, there, there, there is publicity around so-called world asteroid day, but nobody's taking it seriously. We don't take anything seriously unless it's smacks us. Like people don't quit cigarettes until they get cancer. There's something about human beings that we don't consider the pos. We have this idea in our head that we're eternal and we're going to live forever and everything's gonna be fine.

Speaker 1:          02:16:11       Just I just need a new Lexus. You know what I mean? Well, you have this wacky, I just need this watch that I've added my eye on this laptop that I want to buy it. If something happened, if a massive collision hit China. Yeah. And it wiped out like several million people and then cause the earth to go into nuclear winter and crops died and we experiment experience global famine, then something like that, then we would wake up and go, all right Russia, let's talk, let's get together. I'm hoping that it doesn't take anything quite that extreme. If we had a repeat of tin goose can 1908, I think that would be enough to do it. That would be nice. But would it be because there was this incident in Russia that was last year. There was caught on all those dashboard cameras. Yeah. Where's the wonderful thing about Russia?

Speaker 1:          02:16:57       It's apparently there's so much like insurance crime and so many collisions with each other that a lot of people over in Russia have dash cam. Okay. Right. I was wondering why. So because of those dash cams, that's how we have all this footage of these, these meteors that, that uh, blew up in the atmosphere and didn't even land. But we have some from inside schools where people were watching like this thing happened and go down and that was nothing. And now, yeah, there was a fraction of the size of the Tunguska event, but nobody was killed. You see if, if that object had been a little bigger, if it's been, if it's a PR, a little or the little dancer, it's angle of approach had been a little steeper. You might've been looking at 1500 deaths rather than just 1500 injuries. I think that would have been a wake up call.

Speaker 1:          02:17:47       Perhaps. Maybe not enough to reorient civilization, but I guarantee you a tongue goose go event over a major inhabited area of the globe wiping out a million people. I, I can't imagine that that wouldn't have some kind of a effect on our attitude towards our are in our vulnerability in the cosmos and make people think maybe there's something bigger we need to be paying attention to here rather than, you know, um, Kardashians melting vulnerable. This is the illusion created by, by modern technology. We need to make a war on asteroids. Like we have a war on terror. You know, Congress, we'll just kind of at least that would be a useful project yes. Is, is to actually do something that could benefit and say human race instead of Moses profitable and hatred. But see that's the thing. These asteroids are actually extraordinary sources of resources, natural resources, platinum group metals and hydrocarbons and water and precious metals.

Speaker 1:          02:18:49       All of these things that we're mining from the earth now exist in those asteroids that are threatening the planet. And we're not that far away from being able to develop the technologies in the industries to actually go and rendezvous with an asteroid. Of course it's, it's, it's a matter of, like Graham was saying, I mean this last Halloween asteroid, they didn't find it, but a couple of weeks before it passed by the earth. So we need a lot more, um, capabilities of seeing what's out there. Um, and we're developing that but at a very slow pace. So there are practical suggestions that come out of all of this.

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       This isn't just about the past. As Randall said, this is also about the future of the human race and what we do and how we, how we live on this, on this gorgeous planet that the universe gave us and, and how we pay back for being given that opportunity. And so the, the

Speaker 5:          02:19:43       current ideas are to somehow or another nudge these asteroids out of the way.

Speaker 4:          02:19:48       Well, 10 different technologies to do it. What you don't really want to do is to blow it up with the nuclear, right? Right. Because then you get back shot instead of a single bullet. Buckshot can do a lot of harm as well and it may even push it into a more catastrophic orbit. So you don't want to do that. But what you can do, for example, is to change the reflectivity of one side of the asteroid or comet fragments. Uh, you can alter that effectively, paint it and that affects the sun's radiation upon it. And that would be enough to shift it slightly out of its course. There are a lot of, there are a lot of techniques and suggestions or nudges that this is you. You put your finger on exactly the right word. This is another of the technologies that you just nudge these things you just don't need. You just don't need to do much and you put them into a safe place instead of a dangerous place.

Speaker 5:          02:20:35       Czar idea that there's hundreds of thousands of killers out there and you just have to excuse me from over there please. A little bit of this and then also we have to look out for all of them. The ones that are coming from down there, the ones that are coming from up here, three dimensional space. That got a real, I have to think of, because when we look at the sky, oh, hope and asteroids not coming our way from where fucker. You know the last thing is crazy and is it coming from the direction of the sun so that we can see it except very special camera. That was the case with tin goose. It came out. In fact, if you read the eyewitness accounts, they describe how it looks like was being disgorged from to Sun. Oh. Are being expelled from to or was like a second son in the sky.

Speaker 5:          02:21:14       And that was because that, that um, summertime towards stream is coming from behind the sun. Yeah. And um, and so yeah, you can't see him if because of the gravity of the sun, the mass of the sun. Doesn't that affect how we see things behind it anyway? Yeah, it should do, it should warps it warps vision. Yeah. So like something could be coming from behind the sun and we, we, we literally would not even see it because of the mass and gravity of the sun if it was in the right area. Can Goucho was not seen really until it came into the atmosphere, maybe into the atmosphere. But that was obviously a long time ago and there was not nearly as much observation. The skies as there are today. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:21:57       These are the, um, the steps that we, we, we, we need to take. We need to grow up as a, as a species when you leave our, our childhood a bit behind. It's interesting to speculate what would happen if we had, uh, impacts on the scale that happens 12,800 years ago and I'm pretty sure that it would mean if it, if it were allowed to happen, that it would mean the end of our civilization. This, this civilization would

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       go down. This is a very intensely specialized civilization. I think the, the just in time principle is that we have two day or three day food supply in our cities. You interrupt that and you have a kind of walking dead scenario within, within a week. You know, it's that it's that bad. There's this, this civilization is, appears to be very strong, but in fact it's very fragile and it could easily fall apart. And so many of us in the western technological world actually have no survival skills whatsoever. We don't know how to survive because we depend for our survival upon the complex network of society. Who would survive. A cataclysm like that would be the hunter gatherers, people like the hunter gatherers of the Kalahari in southern Africa or the hunter gatherers of the Amazon Basin. You know, the meek of the world. Those who are not taken into account in the world at all today.

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       They're the ones equipped both with the, the the knowledge and the psychological resources to deal with a situation like that and to carry the human story forward. And I just want to make sure, if I can, if I can play some part in this, I just want to make sure that the descendants of those hunter gatherers 10,000 years in the future are not remembering faintly and vaguely a great lost civilization and magical civilization, which had the ability to go to the moon, which had the ability to, one person could speak to another person on the other side of the planet and magical, magical powers which was destroyed because of its own arrogance and cruelty. And that lost civilization of course would be us. Well, one of the things has been disturbing me as I got older is the idea of print about, uh, books, sort of going away and everything is becoming digital and digital to the form that you can only read with an operating system and a computer and a CPU and all that jazz.

Speaker 3:          02:24:20       If without all that, it's nothing. It's not look at a hard drive. It's just there's nothing there. Just electrons take away, take away the software and it'll never be read again. Yeah. And what, what evidence would there be a thousand years from now of us if something were to happen? It might be anybody might be some weed. No, they were computer disks, but the descendants of that time would have no idea what they were. And even if they did, they'd have no way of accessing and a thousand years from now they would deteriorate to nothing. Anything, nothing. All the plastic would be gone, everything. It would just be a complete, a complete mess. That's where I look at megalithic stone architecture is being a textbook. Yeah. That's how you might preserve things in another way. You might preserve things if you're developed a mythology around this whole scenario and then you projected it onto the night sky so that generations later they would tell these tales based upon the, the mythological figures juxtaposed on the night sky.

Speaker 3:          02:25:16       And there would be the story because it's there. It's, it's all the whole mythos. Western mythology has been juxtaposed onto the fixed stars. And so that's one way perhaps of, of preserving information. Um, and the other way I think is, is massive stone architecture. So it's clearly not an accident that the great pyramid in codes, the dimensions of our planet routine close to them. You, you, you measured the base perimeter of the Great Pyramid and multiply it by 43,200 and you get the equatorial circumference of the earth. Why that number? The well, that's the key thing. And I'll come to that in a second. If I may. Uh, you take the height of the great pyramid, multiply that by 43,000, 200 and you get the polar radius of the earth. Actually Egypt told to know this, but they say it's a complete coincidence cause what's the significance of the number 43,200 but actually it's a highly significant number.

Speaker 3:          02:26:09       It's a number that is found embedded in mythology all around the world. And it is a multiple of the number 72 it's actually 600 times 72 and 72 is the heartbeat of the processional cycle. One degree of change every 72 years. So what they've actually done is they've given us the dimensions of our planet on a scale defined by emotion of the planet itself. And that in my shoe is incredibly clever way to pass information down to the future. That way they can be sure that any astronomically literate society could work this out. The information would be there. So in all those dark ages, when we had no knowledge that we even lived on a planet, or what its dimensions where those dimensions were encoded into the enduring structure of the Great Pyramid of monument as the Arab say, that time itself would fear the great pyramids themselves.

Speaker 3:          02:27:02       The Great Pyramid of Giza in particular is so spectacular that it almost, it almost makes you go, man, there had to be something going on there. Then we must be missing part of this picture. Cause you're talking about something that would be, I've heard people say we could reproduce it today. Of course we could. And of course we could. We can. Can you make a stone that's the size of one of the stones in the Great Pyramid? Yes. Yeah. Well then we can make the pyramid, but how long would it take? Yeah. How hard would it be and where would be the will and you'd have to be perfect. Yeah. In order to get it to line up at the top. The way it sets. Yeah, exactly. You can't be off by a fraction of an inch, otherwise you have a corkscrew instead of a pyramid. That's the, that's, that's the, the, the whole problem.

Speaker 3:          02:27:45       No, it's a, it's an amazing device. A multifunctional device in, in my view, in, in coding and coding knowledge, but also working on, on human consciousness. I, I've had the privilege to be alone inside the great pyramid. Not surrounded by hundreds of others. And as the silence descends, this sense of intelligence seems to come out from the wall. Something is speaking to you there. And I think that partly what it was designed to do was to affect human consciousness. And in a weird way, it's still doing. So it's just getting people majestic structure, just being so magnificent and incredible that you just go whoa. And also the sensory deprivation

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       element, you know, you're, you're inside the so called King's chamber, which had nothing to do with any king. This amazing granite geometrical room, 300 feet above the ground in the heart of the great pyramid. As that silence descends, you feel this monument begin to speak to you. It's almost like it's shy. Put 50 people in there and the dialogue goes away, be in there alone, listen to the silence and it starts to speak. Wow. Wow, that's amazing. It's just, it's such a special thing that we have this, this area where you can see these ancient structures and, and causes your mind to wander and think about these things and these possibilities. And when you add that to all the information that you guys have accumulated over the course of your study and your research, it's just an amazing, amazing thing to consider. I should mention another site which we've not talked about today, which is good in Padang, in Indonesia.

Speaker 4:          02:29:16       Uh, and again, I have a couple of chapters on this in the, in the new book good in Padang, uh, is a man they pyramid. Um, and it's been found about 30, uh, about three hours drive west of Bandung on the island of Java. Uh, and for a long time it was thought to be a relatively young megalithic site. There's a megalithic site on top of what was thought to be a natural hill, uh, but now, uh, an amazing Indonesia and geologists called Danny Hilman, Natalie Georgia, uh, has been over it with his team. They've done ground penetrating radar and seismic tomography on the whole structure and they've also put drill cores down into it and they have pulled up remnants of manmade material associated with dateable organic material that goes back 20,000 years. It goes back right into the last ice age. This is a 20,000 year old pyramid sitting in Indonesia and it's one of the most exciting breaking stories in archaeology.

Speaker 4:          02:30:10       And typically because the discovery work has been done by a geologist, Indonesian archaeologists are wanting the whole work stopped. So this is it right here. Ah, that's not good and down. No, no. It says about the, the, the, the, the, those are good and put down, not the, so the, so for example, third from the right third from the left. I mean that one. Yeah, that's the, that's the known megalithic site on top of what is now understood to be a completely manmade pyramid. We're, so this is accepted only by geologists, not by archeologist. The archeologist say, oh, we know that site. It's 2,500 years old. There's nothing of interest there. We would like the resources that are being spent on this to be spent on our projects instead. And in fact, they've lobbied with the Indonesian government and the excavations have been temporarily halted.

Speaker 4:          02:30:57       Uh, I think that it will go ahead again. I think what it, what is the evidence that shows where's the geological evidence and shows that this is first, first of all, the ground penetrating radar. That picture of what is inside this shows us that it is a manmade hill, not a natural hill. Secondly, that it contains three large chambers within it. One of them at least as large as the king's chamber in the Great Pyramid, huge cavities, regular in shape, which have not yet been excavated. Um, and, and thirdly, that the date of this site puts us back to 20,000 years, right to the last glacial maximum when Indonesia didn't look at tall the way it looks today. Indonesia 20,000 years ago was part of a giant continent that geologists called call a Sundar Sundar land, the Sunda Shelf, uh, that it wasn't a peninsula, the Malaysian peninsula and the thousand islands of Indonesia.

Speaker 4:          02:31:48       It was a massive landmass and that land mass was submerged predominantly between twelve thousand eight hundred eleven thousand six hundred years ago. This site sits in an area of high land, which was never submerged. And it looks to me, again, I'm speculating because the excavation has been stopped, but it looks to me as does go directly Tepi like it, like a time capsule. Something that takes us back to that earlier period. And, and in fact when we're looking for a lost civilization, I think we should be looking all over the world. Plato made it clear that Atlantis wasn't just the island, it was a, it had projected it's power all around the world. Uh, Indonesia is a very fruitful area for further investigation. And I did a huge research trip in Indonesia and I saw megaliths that had just unaccounted for. The archeology has never been done. There's a giant megalithic culture in that, in that island.

Speaker 4:          02:32:40       And it's very cool. Some cultures on Indonesia are still making megaliths today. They're, they're still doing it. It, it continues this ancient tradition. So when we're looking at this, what are you, what are you guys saying? I'm seeing a hill. I sing a bunch of rocks. Yeah. Those. That bunch of rocks is the known Megalithic site, which has correctly been dated to 2,500 years ago. It's what you say megalithic site. This is a material called columnar battle, which forms of forms naturally, by the way, into into regular patterns. The giant's causeway in Ireland is a columnar battled columnar basle when it, it forms naturally forms in vertical formations. It's a very useful building material. It can be broken up into blocks and when you see them laid out horizontally like this, you know absolutely that human beings have been involved and that they have made this site.

Speaker 4:          02:33:32       But what's really interesting is what's underneath what we're seeing there. What's been revealed by the ground penetrating radar and the drill cores that is, that is really fascinating because that has not been taken into account by archeology at all and that's where we need to do this work. If we're going to recover our lost pass, Indonesia is one of the places we need to be doing it. Sort of someone like me that's looking at this, I'm just seeing a bunch of stones. Yeah, that's what you're seeing. So 2,500 year old site. But what it appears to be the case that that site was put there because there was an ancient memory that this was a sacred site. The word, the name Gunung Padang in the Indonesian language doesn't seem to mean very much. It means mountain,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       but in the sooner knees language, which is the language that is spoken around Gunung Padang, what Gunung Padang means is mountain of enlightenment. Whoa suggestion that it's connected to an ancient system of knowledge. It's one of many sites that are appearing around the world now that don't fit with the mainstream picture. So this sort of parallel, some of the ideas about the old kingdom in Egypt and the ancient structures where the new structures are built on top of them and as they dig deeper into the sand, they find different construction methods that represent an older tire. Exactly, exactly. This is that, that, so this is 20,000 years old underneath this. Yeah, that's right. Wow. And what, what can we, is there any images that we could look at or is there anything that we could see other than this? Um, well I have a lot in the book.

Speaker 1:          02:35:06       I know she went out the image above it. That's an artist's rendition to look like that's an absolute artist's rendition, which I don't value. It's it, it, it, it almost takes the form of misinformation. We need to be looking at the real thing. Berries at bet. Now there that painting, you have your cursor just on it, just Greg on that. That is an artist's interpretation of what Gunung Padang would have looked like in its original 20,000 years ago before it became overgrown. But that is the mind blower. Then if this 20,000 years ago, if this actually exists to this gigantic megalithic structure that was created by human beings, advanced civilization beyond a shadow of a doubt 20,000 years ago, and it's a deal in an area that was devastated by the global floods of 12,800 years ago and that became a completely different from how it was before.

Speaker 1:          02:35:54       Before that. What was the area that had that gigantic super volcano detonation 70,000 years ago, but that's another Indonesian store and that is Indonesia and that that is literally where a massive amount of the population of the earth of human beings was wiped out. May of 70 the human population went down to just 2000 individual cheese. That's like a good comedy show for me. Like a theater can imagine that everyone in my show repopulate the fucking earth. Sometimes our species hangs by a thread. Sometimes we hang by a thread that that was one of those times. See that is crazy. The idea that just the earth can have a hiccup and that's not even an asteroid. That's the earth itself. That's up. Belching. Belches destroys the environment to the point where it creates nuclear. Winter kills all the crops. Most of the animals die and 2000 people scratch and claw their way, the existence.

Speaker 1:          02:36:56       Wow. And only 70,000 years ago, so 50,000 years before this, so 50,000 so there's been a series of these. Yes, there've been a series of these and we as a species of kind of dawn [inaudible] in and out of them and from time to time they have radically changed our story, our Hubris in creating drives, hard drives and flash drives and computers and phones and no one remembers anything. I can, I maybe know for phone numbers, you know, we don't, we don't use the power of memory anymore and we don't write anything down and, and anything that's going to survive any sort of a disaster. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's where the systems like free masonry command, because here you have a body of symbolism that's been handed down at least since the Middle Ages. And you have a lot of, you know, currently active masons who in order to become master masons have to memorize a tremendous amount of information.

Speaker 1:          02:37:59       Most of them don't have a clue as to what it means though, even though they're told right into ritual. If you want to understand this, you have to understand astronomy. First of all, you have to understand geometry and a number of other things. But, um, a tremendous amount of, of memory work is involved. And this is the ancient system, the oral traditions involved memory on a massive scale, being able to recite verbatim things that might take you hours to recite. And we, like you guys have just discussed, we were losing that ability. And, and this is, you know, to me it's, it's regrettable that freemasonry has gotten such a bad rep with all of these silly conspiratorial things in the last, in the age of the Internet. I got to tell you how many times on Facebook or the Internet, somebody, and they expressed it as, as an accusation.

Speaker 1:          02:38:51       Yeah. Graham Hancock is a Freemason. Well, first off, I'm not a free mason. I've never been a free mason and I never will be a free mason because I'm not a joiner. I don't join clubs. My, my job is to write books. And if I, if I join a particular club that's going to compromise my ability to do that. I have given lectures in masonic lodges. I've been invited to give lectures there. And I, I'm, I'm very interested to talk to Mason's, but, uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not amazing myself. And it is strange that there is this idea that free masonry is, is connected to some kind of global conspiracy. I think it's much more complicated and much more interesting than that. Well, it's a, an ancient, like, as you said, and an ancient way of sort of storing and passing down knowledge and ideas. I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of wacky people that are involved in it too. Most of them are in it for them. Frank Beer, not freemasonry is largely a male drinking. Maybe I'm in then maybe I need to find these people. Well, actually, maybe that's in the UK. In the US, there's no drinking in the lodge. The lodge is not even the lodge itself, but, but afterwards, okay, I'm out. It was a lot of alcohol goes down. I was in, I'm now I'm out.

Speaker 1:          02:40:01       Well, yeah, drinking does mess with your memory though. So I see that there is a tremendous body of symbolism in there, which I think is critical to understanding a lot of these ancient mysteries. How's ancient origins? One of the things that's so confusing about our money, right? And so conspiratorially, uh, constantly debated about the origins of the symbolism on our money. You know, the pyramid with the eye ball on top of it. And there's so many theories as to what this means and that means, and Oh, look at the way they structured from Washington DC and where the Pentagon is and where all these different buildings are all zoll mason stuff and they want to take over the world. And Yeah, I dunno, but it's a who knows really basket. I think what's important about it is that it's a system of ideas that definitely has very ancient origins, which we're seeing a modern manifestation of it now.

Speaker 1:          02:40:50       But it tracks back a long way into the past. And this shows that the ideas can be passed down below the radar and can survive and can continue. Well the, the eyeball on top of the pyramid, man, I would love to go back to the dude who created the dollar bill and go, what are you doing? And what the fuck is that? How come you just don't say $1 and have the have the dude's face and we're good. Right? Why do you have to have a pyramid with an eye ball? Yeah. Like what does that mean? What a wonder what it meant to them? What is it supposed to symbolize? I think it means the same thing to admit to the ancient Egyptians. We find the eye of Horus Egyptian. Doesn't the eye of Horus represent the pineal gland? That's a good argument. Yeah. It actually looks like the pineal gland from a side profile.

Speaker 1:          02:41:35       It looks exactly like it looks like it. And, and um, we know that a DMT was available in nature in Egypt, but the ancient Egyptian tree of life is occasionally Latika, which is rich in DMT in its, in its box. Well, that's also the tree that they're considering the the modern Jerusalem scholars have attached to Moses and the burning Bush, the burning Bush being the source of divinity or the source of, of God, of divine knowledge, God being a burning Bush and that Bush being the Acacia tree, Acacia tree being rich and DMT. I mean, it only makes sense if you try to break it down and translate it, if that, if anybody who's done DMT knows what a profound and life changing experience it can be and how there is this feeling when you do it, that you are connecting to some sort of divine entity.

Speaker 1:          02:42:22       Well, we have to look at this image. Okay, should I go you at Jamie, put it up there. Well, it's a typical, you find this in all kinds of masonic that's spooky to do and given a a haircut. Well, he's going to wanes. You see what you have here is a juxtaposition of different symbols and they all have an interpretation. Bright. You see the old man father time, but he holds the sick father. Time also has wings. Two wings, wings well applies. What time flies. Flies. Well, I dare you. You notice notice the Hourglass, right? Okay. The hourglass by the cycle and the cycle is a symbol for the comment. I'm going to go ahead and a calmness bill some. Yes, I can show you how that works. You know the word comment

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       comes from the Latin Cometa or come eat done, which means what long hair, right? Oh Randal. Long hair had star actually looks a bit like a company. So as you're looking at the star in the sky and you see the tail, they, they think of that as the hair of the con. Yes, exactly. So what you have there is the long hair right there. That's a signal right there. That as a reference, and I can show you a couple of other things to show. The time was going bald. What's all that about? Yeah. Well he's making up for it was the whiskers. Yeah. Um, but you'll notice what she holds in her right hand, the sprig of Acacia once you hold it. And so in, in the masonic symbolism, Acacia represents resurrection. Rec represents restoration. After in the masonic allegory, you have the, the death of the master builder and the raising of the master builder.

Speaker 2:          02:44:10       And the symbolism for this, whether it ultimately, I think goes back to the death and resurrection of a Cyrus and the death and resurrection of all of these God figures in history, which could be taking in resurrecting gods, the diamond, the resurrecting gods, which could be taken as a metaphor really for the god standing in for the human species for human civilization. And she's, she's actually weeping. She's holding in her left hand a Cyborg IOM, which was a symbol from alchemy in the Masonic Sansi. It's in that container that she's holding that the alchemy takes place, which you might speculate is maybe the extraction of the DMT from the occasions. What I was gonna say, it looks almost like one of those incents holders. You know, you put the, you get an incense cone, you put it in, you put the lid on that, and the incense comes through that, right.

Speaker 2:          02:44:58       And she's looking at a book and she's looking at a book, right? And then the book is sitting on a broken column, the broken column. Uh, actually that what that represents is very well depicted in this next image here, which was basically the loss, the destruction of the lost civilization. And that's what she's weeping overseas. She's holding the occasion because that's the symbol of Resurrection, right? How civilization is then renewed Phoenix, like out of the ashes of the previous one out of drugs. Maybe assistant maybe with some assistance will help. Yeah. So, so you see there and then you and you go back to this, see, it's all there. And once you begin to understand that the symbolism of this, you can begin to read it just like a, a book or a manuscript almost. You see? And there we see it a 19th century depiction of, you know, the destruction of civilization by coming by a comment.

Speaker 2:          02:45:57       Yes. And absolutely fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting stuff. Um, boy, there's a lot of work in that, you know, is this a universal description, like the way or interpretation of what you're saying is, has everyone agree on that? No. No, no. In fact, basically most of more look at it and really not really understand the law. That's pretty what in many different cultures, a calm it is the long haired Star it looks like on Saturday. And sometimes it's the cosmic serpent, sometimes it's a sip and sometimes it's a serpent. Yeah, it looks like an old dude that's creeping on. A young girl was trying to read like, you know, she's trying to read, he's trying to give her a back massage and just trying to be kind of being creepy, but it looks like [inaudible]. Good. Well here we have, this is a 19th century masonic carpet. Now you'll notice several things on here. What do you see up on the right? A comment. A comment, yes. And immediately to the left of the comic you have a Lunar Crescent and then you have the seven stars. And what does the seven stars usually depict? The Pleiades? Yeah, part of the Taurus constellation. Exactly. Yeah. And if you superimpose the radiant of the Taurid meteor shower almost bolts eyes right on the right on the Pleiades, and you find the Pleiades playing an important part in not only the masonic ritual, but in many traditions,

Speaker 4:          02:47:20       additions there even clearly depicted in the hall of bulls in Lascaux in France 17,000 years ago at depiction of the constellation of tourists with the plate, he's clearly marked on the shoulder of the, of the bull. So anybody who argues that there was no ancient knowledge of the Zodiacal constellations, go to Lascaux and you'll realize there was.

Speaker 2:          02:47:38       Wow. And you'll notice down here there's the arc, which of course is symbolizing the great flood. And you've got a lot of things going on here. You've got the coffin with the occasion growing out of it, which again is symbolizing this resurrection after the death. So that one plant plays an important role over and over and over. Those are very important role. It doesn't mean it can't be coincidental that the road, that day

Speaker 4:          02:48:01       planning human culture has been radically underestimated and misunderstood by, by, uh, our scholars. Is there any depictions in the ancient world of utilization, of DMT, of smoking, it, of, there's many depictions of, of the ancient Egyptian and ancient Egyptian figure holding some kind of pipe. Uh, and now that we know that occasionally Latika is a DMT rich tree and that the ancient Egyptians certainly had the chemical knowledge to extract the DMT from that bark. The very word chemistry actually comes from the name of ancient Egypt, which was Kemet the black land. That's where we get the word chemistry from. We can be pretty sure what they were smoking. Um, there is a particular scene by the way, where we see another visionary, um, agent. The datura plant, um, raise in the form of Datura flowers are descending into the brow, into the third eye of the initiative in, in, in that image. The imagery is all there. You just have to dig it out and look for it and find it, look for it with eyes that are willing to see. That's the crucial thing.

Speaker 2:          02:49:05       I've never seen the, uh, hieroglyphs of them holding a pipe. Oh yeah. There's, there's maybe a funny Jeremy, do you see any? Yeah. Wow. So what are we looking at here, Randall? Oh, just another version of these old masonic carpets, but the thing that you'd want to look at here, what the beehive thing in the lower left hand corner there. Yeah. That seems to be over and over again. You see over and over again. Yeah. Why a beehive? Is it a beehive? Beehive? Yeah, it is. So it does it. Is it supposed to represent like beekeeping and is a form of I will agriculture or I'll fill you in on that someday. These were a symbol of royalty in ancient Egypt. You find them all over the temple of conic for example, one of the masonic context. It has a very interesting connotation which would be probably beyond what we could get into another show. It's another whole nother show on bees.

Speaker 2:          02:49:59       Does it? I mean what, what I mean when you look at, well it's one of the main concerns that we have today is that our cell phone signals and a lot of the pesticides that we're using are killing off bees. Okay. The cell phone signals are apparently like really confusing bees and messing them up and the Wifi and all the waves, radio waves and different things in the atmosphere interfere with their communication. But then on top of that, the pesticides we're putting on crops, all these, and then there's diseases that bees are getting. And we have a serious problem with the honeybee population. I know. And to have that as a big part of their culture, to have bees is a big part of their culture, says something. Yeah. You know what your superficially told in the masonic ritual is that bees are a symbol of industry, but when you're being in to look into it, the beehive itself is interesting architecturally.

Speaker 2:          02:50:50       Right? You know, because what it does, it has the maximum volume to weight ratio virtually have any structure, but there's other considerations there as well, which again is a, is another show. But if you look carefully right up in here, you'll notice there's a twin comet twin stars. You see the tails and you'll notice that you, you know, that comets, their tails are always pointing away from the sun. They're not like trails behind like the wake of a boat. They're pointing away from the sun. You see? And if you look at this, you see you've got the sun right here and you've got these moving away. The heart is a symbol for the earth. The sword is another symbol for the comment. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:51:38       So all of us, wow. All of this mystery, uh, s, uh, surrounds us and, and, and, and all of it takes us back to a time that we've forgotten and we need to know about that time. We need to, we need to recover our memory. The, the, the, the human species is in a kind of broken state right now. Uh, psychologically you can see it in the world. There's a, there's this miasma of hatred and fear and suspicion that are just enveloping the whole world.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       And we are being divided artificially from one another when Trudy, we are all brothers and sisters. And we need to recover that knowledge if we're to move forward to the future. And on that note, I also want to thank you for another thing, Joe, which is for smoking me up last re-introducing marijuana. I had three years of abstinence from marijuana and that abstinence ended, uh, when we sat down for our last chat, September, 2014. Well you seem so healthy. I'm like, I don't think pods the problem. No, it's not the problem. I am. What's happened is I've completely changed my relationship to that beautiful and magical herb. It's not a dependent relationship anymore. It's not an obsessional relationship. If I have it, I enjoy it. If I don't have it, I enjoy my life anyway. That's beautiful. Yeah. I have a friend who was a drug counselor and last time he was telling me his story is also a comedian.

Speaker 1:          02:52:58       And last time he was telling me a story court court, McGowan great guy. And he was telling me a story about this kid that is a, that he's trying to help that what he said. I had never met a marijuana addict for and uh, he met this kid and this kid was smoking just massive, massive amounts of marijuana. He's trying to help him in his clinic and he realized along the way, it's not, it has nothing to do with the marijuana. Like he's got some crazy psychological issue that's going on and the marijuana just happens to be the thing he's using to try to fill up to medicate that. It's not that he has this physical addiction that's impossible to, there is no physical addiction. If the marijuana wasn't there, he'd find something else. Yes, that's what it is. And then when he dug deep into it, this poor kid has just a devastating childhood and there's all sorts of issues.

Speaker 1:          02:53:45       Psychological, it was the case with addiction. It's the, it's, it's the pain in the individual that's the source of it, not the substance. That's, I think we can all relate to a certain amount of madness. And I know I certainly can because I think we all capable of going down. You Bet. Spirals and pass and then you know that the concept of hitting rock bottom, like sometimes you have to like hit something where you can't continue your momentum and you must regroup. And in that regrouping, you reassess or reevaluate and it's one of the reasons why I'm so addicted to sensory deprivation tanks because that's my regrouping. It's an amazing, it's an amazing place to regroup and thank you for introducing me to that. Uh, as, as, as as well. I am so grateful that there's people out there that have continued that tradition of building those things from the Samadhi tanks from the early sixties, from John Lilly to today crashed and the float lab and, and, and the zero gravity in Austin. I mean, they've done some amazing work and making sure these things are like uptodate and the most, uh, the most modern technology as far as filtration systems and installation. And now they're magical. I mean, absolutely. You went to crash, right?

Speaker 1:          02:54:56       Plastic, fantastic experience. I have to say, I'm really thinking about putting one of those in my house. It, everybody should. I mean, God, man, you

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       know, that's the way to it. That's the way it is, the way to it. And to enjoy the experience to the maximum to get the maximum benefit out of the experience and intensely intensely psychedelic without adult edibles. Exactly. I'm, I'm really encouraged by what's happening in America, that we are seeing the legalization of cannabis, that the American people state by state are just putting their finger up to this federal authority and saying we are adults. We have a right to decide what we do with our own bodies and our own consciousness. And there is that air of freedom now in, in Washington state and Oregon up there in Alaska, Colorado. And, and that's, so this is part of my book tour that I'm really looking forward to when I go present an event in Seattle, which I'll do in early December and in Portland, Oregon and in Denver and in boulder.

Speaker 3:          02:55:53       I'm a Denver Saturday night. I couldn't be more excited to get there. I was so pumped. I can't wait to get there. And it's a great place. It's a point of freedom and it's also a point of prosperity. Yes. Denver has, they have exceeded their, their what? They had it in terms of like their expectations for how much money they were going to make out of this in terms of tax revenue. It's gone through the roof is the first time ever they make more money from taxes and marijuana. Then alcohol exact, which is fucking crazy. You go around Colorado, you see how many bars there are, how many liquor stores and the restaurants are serving booze. They make more money in taxes from marijuana. They do from all of that, let's face it, Mary one is a far superior substance to our call. I'll call the horrible place.

Speaker 3:          02:56:35       It's not hurting. The booze is not heading the boost business. Yeah, violent crime is down. Drunk driving is the lowest level. It's been a decade. I mean the whole thing is inquisitive, very positive story real has coming up. Colorado is proving to the world is that the emperor of the war on drugs wears no clothes. The war on drugs is bullshit. It is from beginning to end and it's a grotesque abuse of the right of adults to make decisions about their own bodies and their own consciousness. So right on with Colorado and the American people who are making this happen only in America could this breakthrough take place. It's true that America as a state entity has been a dark force behind the war on drugs, but the American people state by state are unraveling that horror and replacing it with something new. This could never happen in Britain.

Speaker 3:          02:57:22       I mean we have counties in Britain like Yorkshire or Northumberland. I can't envisage a situation ever where Yorkshire would make marijuana legal when London says no, but in America you can do it and this is going to change the world. It's not. It's not because of marijuana itself. That's not the point. It's not about getting high. It's about respecting the rights of adults to make decisions about their own bodies, their own health and their own consciousness. That is a fundamental human right and we're beginning to realize that that's exactly what's been taken away from us by the war on drugs. I think it's also about making decisions based on data. And I think in a way that parallels what you guys are up to. Yeah. Because I think people are understanding now that we, we've been

Speaker 5:          02:58:02       sold a bill of goods by these so called experts about marijuana. They've told us so many long nonsense. And not only that, the politicians have hired experts to review the data and then buried it when it did meet your expectations. Yes,

Speaker 2:          02:58:15       exactly. Well, I have to confess that all of this with me started back in the old days when I was camping in these canyon lands into Western states and altering my consciousness and looking at the landscape and going, something is going on here. There's a story here that is wanting to come out and you know, you can, I think that you have the Ph. We have the potential literally to almost time travel with some of these substances and peer into the past and see it in ways that we would have never seen otherwise. Um, and then not literally, but like get a, a sense of your mind. He knew perspective, a fresh view. You were talking about it the last time you were here that you were on acid. Right? That's what it was. I said in Payoti mostly the children of this little bit of that, but yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:59:05       Spending, you know, a lot of time out, you know, hiking and camping, you know, from, from Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean and all those Northwestern states. You know, I spent months out there, you know, just hanging in the landscape, you know, living in, in, in tents up on mountain tops and, and, and thinking about what was I seeing, you know, and um, that's really where it started for me. And I think that combining, combining, you know, this immersion into the landscape, you're talking about the sensory deprivation, which is a way to powerfully go in. At the same time, you can have the counterpart of that which is powerfully going out and seeing, seeing the night sky in this altered state, seeing the landscapes around you and realizing that a heel isn't just a hill. There's a story there. There's, there's some process that we have to come to come to, to reckon with in order to understand this planet we're living on.

Speaker 4:          02:59:59       There's an interesting point here, which is the part of the technological world is to regard, uh, nature as a matter as dead. You'd know that there's just this dead [inaudible]. We're the only consciousness on the planet in the, in the universe. And they will refuse to consider the possibility that nature may be highly conscious and highly intelligent, but there may be intelligence in nature. And it seems to me what the psychedelics are, are nature's way of speaking to us when we've closed our minds and shut ourselves down when we've taken the soul out of the universe and just turned it into a huge machine, the psychedelics are coming back and saying, hang on you monkeys.

Speaker 5:          03:00:40       I don't know everything. Listen to us. We got something to teach. And with that we just ran through three hours. Yeah, that's it. How crazy is that? Those three hours? It seems like it's 20 minutes. It was probably more than three hours, right? We overtime we're over. Uh, listen, thank you so much, Graham. Hancock, magicians of the gods. You can get it right now on, what is your website again? Graham hancock.com. Graham hancock.com. Sacred Geometry International. Sacred geometry. I. N. T I believe is your Twitter handle? Is that what it is? I think that's right. Um, I'll check right now real quick. Yes. Sacred geometry. Just sacred geo. Sacred. G. O. I. N. T. Okay. And Randall, thank you so much. Knowing double underscore between the grass. Well, you could find it folks. If you go to my Twitter page, it'll be on my Twitter page. You could find both of their, uh, their Twitter handles on the post that we made about this. Let's do this again. Can we do this again? Absolutely. I'm a port. Let's do it again in a couple of months. Fantastic. All Right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We'll see you soon. Joe. I would like to keep you out,

Speaker 6:          03:01:49       okay.

Speaker 7:          03:01:53       Okay.
