Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Dan Harris and Jeff Warren. I don't know why it started off that way. Just felt weird. It was weird to start starting aesthetics as always, very odd. Uh, welcome. Welcome Jeffrey. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Dan. First tank experience. We didn't talk too much about it. No, he just got out of the sensory deprivation tank. I don't even know if that's a word. Dragoon it is a word. Um, uh, you know, we should tell people how you did it. You basically taunted me on text, which was awesome. It was called hot, but you were saying that you were scared of being in there. Might be scared. There's nothing to be scared of. It's just water. Yeah. But it's not just water because you're in this enclosed space. You can't see anything or hear anything weird or is in your mind though.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Well that is absolutely correct. I just happened to have a mind that is really good at panicking and I've demonstrated that time and again to myself and others. So I was a little wary that you call me a chicken and I was like, well, fuck, now I have to do this thing. Uh, so I did it. Not without trepidation, but it was really interesting, really interesting. I know you spent so much time exploring your consciousness and meditating and just being in your head that I felt like this is something that you really should be exposed to you. You're absolutely right. And I appreciate it. I really do. It was, it was, what I realized is I think I need to do more of it because the brief discussion we had, I know we want it to not fully explore it until we got on the, on the Pod, a brief discussion we had afterwards.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       One of the things you said is that it's good to kind of explore your boundaries when it comes to fear. This is something actually that my meditation teacher has said to me before and it made me realize I think I need to get in there and start pushing it a little bit in this, um, in the tank, uh, because it will help me in lots of areas of my life because when you don't test those boundaries, your life becomes smaller and smaller and that happens to people with panic. It will, it happens. Just people in general. And I think it's one of the reasons why people fall into panic is because they don't have enough experience with stressful situations to the point where they could just relax and just let it happen. And that that's one of the things that I. One of the reasons why I think martial arts training is very good for people, not just for the self defense aspect of it, but for the aspect of just dealing with stressful situations on a regular basis to the point where you're very comfortable with them and then you realize that the consequences of this is it's not really as bad as you think it is.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       Like most people are terrified a physical confrontation, but when you have physical confrontation on a regular basis, especially through my favorite, which is Jujitsu training, because there's no striking so you don't get hit in the head, you're not worried about brain damage or any of that stuff. It's just basically grappling. But that through continual

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       process of testing yourself and stress and regular life stresses sort of become diminished.

Speaker 3:          00:03:08       I think it's really important. You know, I do some of this in my life, been live news presentation is stressful and I do that a lot of. I've covered many war zones, which is much more stressful, very stressful. Um, but I think there are areas in my life where I've closed off because of claustrophobia in particular. I need Mris for sir. I jacked up my, both of my shoulders and my knee and I haven't been able to deal with them because I just won't get in a scanner. Jeff and I were down at actually at vanderbilt where they wanted to take a look in my brain in a scanner while I meditated. I couldn't do it. That was a great opportunity. It's really expensive to get a neuroscience is to look at your brain while you meditate. And I wasn't able to do it because I'm afraid. Uh, and so I think

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       afraid of it seems like there's no physical fear, right? It's not like there's a dog in the room that's going to bite you. Right? So why not just force yourself to

Speaker 3:          00:04:03       go through it? Well, have you ever expand? Have you ever had a panic attack? No. So it panic attack is, you know, we evolved for this fight or flight instinct where your brain, you know, when you're faced with a saber tooth tiger or whatever with the brain floods with adrenaline and it is overwhelming. I made, it overwhelms all reason. And you, uh, either fight or flight, in this case, it's flight a flea and you, you're, you're, you can't control your body in many ways. And uh, because I've had so many panic attacks, I'm primarily the ones that people know about or the one in particular was on television on Good Morning America in 2004. When your brain learns how to do this, it gets really good at it. And, uh, there's no, you can't hurl yourself into the, um, at least I can't hurl myself into the Lotus position and meditated away. It is overwhelming. And so I can't tell myself a story about, hey, I'm not in physical danger because the body, the brain is just

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       what you're saying is very interesting about getting really good at it. There's a term in archery called target panic and it happens to people. It happens to target archers. It happens to bowhunters. And there's a thing that happens where you literally can't keep the pin on the target. Your, your brain won't let you and no one understands, like the people that are having it while it's happening, they don't understand that like, I can't believe I can't do this, but your brain gets so used to freaking out in this moment that literally you no longer have control and you just, you try to make the shot go off as quick as you can. You'll miss by feet and you just, you can't. You understand it. Like I practice everyday, like how is this happening? But if there's this weird overwhelming sensation of adrenaline and fear and nerves and the chaos of the moment and you just slam the trigger and the Arrow goes flying nowhere near the target and it's really, really common to the point where people seek psychologists and sports trainers and there's always different methods that they use to try to keep in, in a controlled loop system of, of thought process to try to handle this.

Speaker 3:          00:06:19       Probably like you said, athletic trainers would probably the, the fighting it and then getting into your head about it. It's probably the same as when you get in a slump in baseball, you know, it's, you're just locked up in yourself and it takes a long time to get over it. That is, you know, in the tank. I was thinking a lot about how that has been just a huge recurring theme in my life where the ego steps in the thinking mind, the mind that won't surrender to what is actually happening right now comes in. I get locked up and can't do what I want to do. One of the things jeff and I have talked a lot about in our time together is dancing as an I can't do it, can't do it isn't the right way to say it, but I've struggled for a long time with dropping myself consciousness enough so that I can dance in a way that, uh, you know, I have a three year old around the house and we'd like to dance. And even around him I get a little in my own head about it and I think all of these things are related.

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       They must, they have to be. It completely makes sense, but it doesn't make sense to me that you can't get your brain examined when you spend so much time examining your brain. Yeah. So what's different is, is this it

Speaker 3:          00:07:30       interesting time to talk about like the difference between the brain and the mind. So I'm looking at my mind, um, and uh, you know, the, the idea of, first of all, just because I spend, I spent the last nine years looking closely at my mind doesn't mean that I've conquered all my neuroses and I don't know that that's on offer. I think it's a gradual process, you pointed to something important about testing those limits and I think meditation can be really helpful and testing those limits and I was meditating most of the time that I was in the tank and that allowed me bringing that kind of focused attention to what was happening, allow me not to get carried away with the waves of fear that came in and I was able to let them pass without hopping out an embarrassing myself. Um, but I don't know that I can magically. I think it's going to be a process before I can get in an MRI is. But what I'm trying to say in a long way.

Speaker 2:          00:08:29       Well, if you have damaged shoulders when you kind of have to. I do, I do. Do you know you don't, but you don't even know what's wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       I think it's Bursitis, but I need to get a diagnosis before I can figure out whether I got to get surgery or cortisone shot or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:08:42       Full range of motion. Can you put your arms over your head? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You should try hanging. Have you ever looked into hang the southern, it's just something else crazy. You're trying to get music from your shoulders, a dangerous dude to hang onto a bar and having your weight. It's

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       really important for the shoulder joint and it's something that very few people do on a regular basis. I don't do it on a regular basis. Most people don't. And even people that work out don't. And you're constantly compressing your shoulder, compressing and with poor posture, compressing it with stress, exercise and your shoulder needs to expand. And it also needs this sensation of hanging your body weight from your hands. It's tremendous. Rear shoulder impingements. And there's some doctors. There's one doctor in particular that explored this. See if you could find that guy's name, um, who stopped doing most shoulder surgeries and started putting people on hanging therapy where he just tells them, you know, at the beginning, just have a bar that's not quite above your head. So they could just sort of relax your knees and you know, if you can't carry all of your weight in your hands, just carry a good percentage of your weight in your hands.

Speaker 4:          00:09:52       And try to relax your shoulders and it releases impingements, it's stretches that joint out. The idea is that we came from tree swinging primates and then as tree swing primates, we're constantly doing that and that's what the shoulder joint is meant to do. It's meant to articulate in that way we, you grabbed something swinging and then not having this full range of motion and not using it on a regular basis. Here's this guy's book, I'm Dr John Kirsch, John M Kirsch and um, he came up with this many years ago when he realized that one of the things that was messing people up was just they just, their joints weren't being put through the full range of motion. And that by hanging you could release a tremendous amount of pain and a discomfort that a lot of people are facing. That makes a ton of sense. So it seems to me that you guys are actually saying talking about the same thing when you're talking about the mind and you're talking about the body and talking about impingement and you're talking about where your mind is limited.

Speaker 4:          00:10:52       I think it's the same exact dynamic actually that's of what's going on. Like how would you define what an impingement is in the body? A blockade, you know, like I say, lack of range of motion, um, poor exercise habits. There's a variety of factors, ignoring potential injuries and then restricting your motion to the point where everything's sort of tightens up. Muscle tissue in particular. Um, joint tissue like around the shoulders and any, anytime where you're dealing with range of motion issues, you have to stretch and you're, most people very rarely stretched their shoulders. It's just something that we don't do. And also most people very rarely strengthened their shoulders. And I think, uh, it's, it's a very complex joint mean you look at the way your shoulders articulate. There's not like there's not anything in your body that can do this sort of things and the range of motion that your shoulders exhibit while carrying weight.

Speaker 4:          00:11:49       So you think about all the different things. Carrying your kid, picking up a briefcase, you doing a lot of weird motions with your shoulders and occasionally develop little tears. Those tears. I started out superficial. They get larger, you injure them more, you're playing, you don't warm up, something pops, you ignore it, it hurts you for years. There's a lot of things that we do to our bodies that would just. It just compiles and you never handle it. You never deal with it. You don't get that Mri, you don't get therapy and it just gets worse and worse to the point where seeing a lot of people get shoulder replacements, so the exact same thing is true. Everything you just said is true for the mind. It's exactly the same. It's conditioning. It's repeating the same pattern over and over. Having some kind of involuntary response that gets a little bit deeper, a little bit deeper, a little bit deeper each time and it's like your.

Speaker 4:          00:12:36       Your mind is the mental body and it has habits and it develops bad habits and it develops limited range of motions, what it can do, and so we ended up in this really narrow situation inevitably because we ended up with a particular set of conditioning and it starts to limit us. So you use practices just like a used physical practices to open up your range of motion to work through impingements to have more flexibility. You do the same for, you know, with meditation or with other kind of mental practices. I think it's literally the same thing and you and that there's just this sort of a isometric nature between the mind and body. It's the same kind of stuff. It completely makes sense and that was what we were talking about before the podcast when we're in the hallway about just dealing with stressful situations in the tank.

Speaker 4:          00:13:24       Like if there's a weird freak out that happens, like how do you handle it? Like what, what do you do? And I was saying that the more stressful situations that I experienced, the more understand what they are and the more I can relax, but it's also like a matter of constantly being exposed to these stressful situations where there's not a long break in between doing standup or a long break in between martial arts training where to the point where anxiety can build up and then once you get into it, it's almost an. It's an unusual situation instead of a usual one. That's probably why I probably need to get in the tank reasonably soon. Yeah, so say more. If you don't, this is your shot, but if you don't mind, would you say more about that because you, you're able to get in the tank, not only regularly, but you'll, you'll dose yourself with some stuff to get an attack. Well, the, the, the thing about stressful situations is a, you're always trying to, once you get comfortable, you are trying to push them and make them more stressful. And this most district, most stressful way to experience the tank is either edibles or mushrooms. Those are the two for me. Mushroom? Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Well it's just, it's basically mushrooms without any of the distractions of your body and also distilled. It's a pure culture. Yeah. Pure culture. Mushrooms and. But,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       but animals can be just as potent in their edible marijuana is. You know the difference. Most people aren't aware that it's a completely different psychoactive substance when it's. When you eat it because it's processed by your liver and your body produces something called 11 hydroxy metabolite. That's four to five times more psychoactive than thc and it's not psychoactive in the smoking version. It's very different. That's why a lot of people when they eat brownies so strong. Yeah. I'm sure there was a famous nine slash 11 case where uh, uh, there's an audio recording of these cops that took some pop from some kids and made pot brownies of it and then ate it and then called the police and called nine slash 11 on themselves because they thought they were dying. But it is one of the greatest audio recordings of all time, I think of dying. I think time is really. So please send help. Oh my God. That's awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       What do you do in those moments? Like do you have, is that. I'm just interested because you've had, from what I can tell, quite a bit of experience with psychedelics and also isolation tanks. What's the right term for sensory deprivation? Sensory deprivation tanks. So what do you do when the little lamp in your head starts telling you like the world's ending or slow?

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       Just let it go. You have to just relax. I mean, I've been there 100 times, more, many more than a hundred times really, but were you really nervous? Really scared, but what compounds it is trying to control it. What compounds it is trying to wrestle the moment away from this experience and just taking control of it and try to sober yourself up. No, fuck this. I'm going to. I'm going to, you know, I gotta I gotta get getting control of the situation and the freak out is really what compounded. That's where the, that's the root of all, you know, air quotes, bad trips come from is this desire to control failure. Just surrender. You've got to surrender. You've got to relax and resistance. Yeah, nothing's gonna happen to you. You're going to be fine. You're going to feel really crazy and you're going to that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       It brings up memories from years ago from weird conversations you might've had where you acted poorly or weird choices that you might've made decades ago or you know, things that crossed your mind a couple of days ago that you're embarrassed about. There's all these different things that'll come out that will just your, your, your brain, your mind, your consciousness wants to explore these because it feels that you neglected them or that you put them on the back burner or the you didn't give them enough attention. He didn't give them the attention that they deserve, so they're festering and bouncing around the inside of your mind and I find that edibles in particular, it's a very self exploratory experience and your brain desperately wants to point out all these areas that it feels that you might've neglected and that's terrifying for people and he just started really freaking out. Then not to mention the concept of mortality.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       You start thinking about your children's life and your life and you know, you get freaked out in there. Why would you want to do that? Because I think exploring those things makes regular life more, uh, it makes it more palatable. It makes it more relaxed. It makes me, it gives me a perspective. It's almost like having a near death experience on a regular basis. Well, you get out of a near death experience and one of the things that people say is even if it's a near death experience, like from a a severe illness or an injury, you have a perspective enhancement from that and you come out of it feeling like, well, I kind of have a new version of life now. I understand life now because I understand the full spectrum. Before I was operating in this very comfortable spectrum of everything being safe and now I realized like, no, it doesn't have to be. Say there can be terrible things where everything can go wrong, so appreciate this with much more zeal, like much more lust for life if

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       it sounds like what we do in meditation. Oh my God did. I was just thinking that. It sounds like a meditation retreat. I think they're all connected. These questions. Yeah. You're not even taking. You don't. You don't need to ingest anything for all that stuff to start coming up. In fact, there's a kind of classic. There's a classic progression in a retreat or an even in a city. You could say there are these terrains you move through where first year just trying to get going and then you're kind of having all these breakthroughs and insights and then you can get into this really challenging stage where it's like you can't meditate. All your dark stuff is coming up. Sometimes I think of it as like, um, you're exfoliating the brain. You know, you just externally eight exfoliate and a send. You hit an air pocket of some old school shit like your old shame and your rage and your childish petulance and, and it all comes bubbling up and you're inside this atmosphere and then from inside that atmosphere you're seeing everything through that filter.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       You're now seeing how everything sucks and your life's a catastrophe or whatever and that's. And just like you were saying about the body and about the psychedelics and about the tank, you got to learn to be okay with your own uncomfortableness. You've got to learn to be okay to sit inside this discomfort and say actually to welcome it, to say, well, this is just part of what's going on with me right now. And if you can do that without resistance, like you were saying, without fighting with, with it, then it can actually work its way out. And then you can get into this really beautiful stage of a practice where it's, you know, the equanimity stage they call it, where it's just, you're really open and available to things. You're super present. It's not exotic, you're not in some peak experience where you're, you know, melting in oneness and have an energy shooting up your spine. But neither are you in one of these, you know, low experiences, you're just in the, it's like the beautiful ordinary, you know, and those, those are the. And you go round and round and those cycles. And then from actually that beautiful ordinary place that you can have these breakthroughs. And that's the kind of classic place where people have these shifts, you know, they like a no self experience

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       or a pretty interesting. The phenomenology of it is really cool. Like there's people described very specific kinds of things happening that drop them into this next level of our next progression of insight. You could say, and I don't want to overstate my meditative capacities, but, um, I had a, I would say probably like a Jv version of what you're describing a last month, just a few weeks ago, I was on a 10 day silent meditation retreat and I could see as you described this, this progression, I could see in hindsight that that was what I went through. So as your mind starts to settle and you get more concentrated, there are fireworks. You know, you did the, you get a lot of sensations in your body that feel really good. You're seeing things behind your eyes. Um, uh, just the mind releases a lot of dopamine and Serotonin in response to the reduced chatter that can happen when you're more focused on what's happening right now as opposed to caught up being caught up in the, in, you know, our egoic chatter.

Speaker 3:          00:21:53       And I, at one point though, uh, I, I hit a stage that's sometimes referred to as life review where I, I just, all the things I'm most ashamed of just started. I couldn't avoid him. I couldn't sleep and it was all just right there. I was just thinking about them and then I started questioning the whole practice and what am I doing here is just a waste of time. And I had a conversation with my teacher who was a brilliant individual. I mean you could argue, um, some have argued and I would agree, one of the greatest living meditation teachers, his name is Joseph Goldstein and he's not a, he doesn't walk around in robes or anything like that. He's a Jewish guy from the catskills and he's in his seventies and he would, I was staying and he in a cabin and he would pop in and see me in this cabin every once in a while because it was right near his house.

Speaker 3:          00:22:41       And He, one day I was kind of complaining a lot about the futility of my practice and he said, surrender. They said, you got to surrender. You've got to just stop. Just stop getting in your head about are you doing it right? And all that stuff. Just let the practice do its thing. As Jeff sometimes talks about it, it's like lead time in nature, do it's work. Just trust that the practices we've been doing this for Millennia, human beings, it was a reason for that. Just do the practice and stop worrying about it. And the next set I had was this kind of equanimity thing that you're talking about. Where I could see was two hours long. I could see everything coming up. All of my urges, desires, thoughts, physical sensations, things I was hearing, things I was seeing was I was very focused. But at this point it's all just coming at me and I'm not reaching for it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:40       I don't not pushing it away. The unpleasant stuff. I'm not trying to push it away. I'm not trying to grasp onto the pleasant and it's just. And it's, um, it's like this incredible video game, right? Uh, where you can't. I sometimes describe meditation. It's like a video game where you can't move forward if you want to move forward. It's the anti video games and once you stop wanting, once you just surrender into this thing where you're just nonjudgmentally observing, whatever comes up in your mind, whether it's fear, whether it's planning, lunch, whatever it is, who you just, you can start to move forward and then the ego comes in and tells you you are the best meditator ever do. And then you fall for that for a minute. But then you stop falling for that. Anyway, at the end of the, I looked down at my watch and for two hours had passed.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       And, but then I was fully in the zone of like, oh, this is the end of my next book. I, uh, this is, I'm enlightened. This is the best thing ever. And I've, I then a couple of hours later start to realize that I had been telling myself a story about how amazing I was and how they should put a plaque up in that room. This is where the, the best meditation sit ever happened. And, uh, the next meditation I went to, the next time I tried to meditate, it was as if I'd never meditated before. And I just like, I didn't know what I was doing anymore and it all collapsed.

Speaker 4:          00:25:03       Wow, there's so much there. Um, there's an experience that you have in the tank where you, you try to let go and you let go and relax and then you realize, no, you just, there's one layer of relaxation. Totally. But they're stacked on top of each other. There's infinite layers. And as you get deeper and deeper into these layers of relaxation, you hit another layer and you go, okay, now this is relaxing. And then, you know, there's way more than this, there's way more to this. And the more you think about the fact that, oh, now I'm on a new level, relaxation will now you're not. Now you're probably two or three levels above where you were before you addressed it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       That's the one you were talking to him. It just seemed like the layers of the onion and just you have to peel those layers and you're blowing my mind. This is all the shit that I always talk about. It's exactly you're describing. Exactly. It's the layers of the onion. You, it's like you, you're, you're holding this fist and you don't even realize you're holding this fist. You're walking around going, yeah, everything's fine, but you're holding this fist and then you realize you're holding on so tight and the need first. You don't even know how to open. The fist has been closed the whole time. At some point without. You have to. The way you open it is not trying to open it. You have to just be so okay with the fact that you had this tight fist here and eventually it just opens up itself and then you think you're free.

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       And I think if I'd describe it as like walk in the onion, you know, it's like you're walking on top of the annuity and unique. It's imagined the planet is an onion. You're walking and you're turning the onion as you walk and you got the huge open air all around you that the university feel like you're free, but very slowly you're sinking into the onion is a layer of tension, is kind of appearing or coagulation. That starts to kind of coagulate in your experience and eventually realized that there's this layer of tension here and you're not free. You're inside this thing. Then you have to figure out how to

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       exfoliate that or let that go and it just keeps going on because it's turtles all the way down. It's like it's onion layer after onion layer and every time you get into a new place of freedom, the fact and the act of living is creating more coagulation. It's creating more just natural frictions and things that are coming up so it's not just that you're going through. So the the progress of insight, the progress that they call purification in Buddhism is a. is a process of kind of working through your conditioning but also simultaneously learning to work through the new conditioning that's accreting by virtue of just being a human being and that's, that's the game. And that's why a lot of people say there is no end to it. You don't get to some final liberation because just the act of living is creating its own blind spots.

Speaker 4:          00:27:30       You know? So you've got different people in different camps who argue different things about what real freedom looks like, but that, that to me seems the most realistic, you know, at least it's the one that at that fits with my experience and it describes exactly how you describe it and you know, the two are, they really line up. I think most of us are operating on momentum and I think you, you learn things as a child and those become, you know, whatever your personality is, the way with whatever thought process you sort of have carved into your mind like the grooves and patterns that you normally find yourself thinking in. And I equate it to a lot to martial arts training. Like I, I used to teach martial arts for a living. One of the things that I've found incredibly difficult was to reteach people.

Speaker 4:          00:28:18       It was way easier to teach a person with no training than it was to reteach someone with poor training. So when someone has poor training, they have these paths carved in their movements and their thought process and when they're in a situation they fall back on those patterns. And it's extremely difficult to get people out of that and learned to do things correctly. But if you can teach them how to do things correctly from the beginning, then they naturally grow. Like this is the stressful situation. Here comes the problem. Here's the issue. What's the technique? Now you know it and it's locked into your brain. You know the right pathway, whether as like don't go to the technique you've been using all your life. Now use a new technique and and remember to manage that situation under pressure. I think that's how most of us are handling our lives.

Speaker 4:          00:29:05       We're handling our lives with poor techniques and poor management skills and and these pads that are carved in that or infant tile and that are essentially like the the remanence and the echoes of when you were a teenager or even younger than that, and then maybe your parents and the learned behavior that you see watching them and maybe they weren't so good at managing life either, but these patterns are carved into your brain and you find comfort in them because you know where they're going to slide right into them. And then as an adult, you start trying to remap your consciousness and remap patterns, and in doing that it's very difficult to sort of re think how you think.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       I mean, I think what you're pointing to here is close to the, what has become, for me, the animating insight of my whole side hustle as a meditation proponent, which is that the mind is trainable. Now we are you, you describe, I think very accurately the ruts in which many of us find ourselves or don't even know we're in. But the good news is that there are ways to retrain the mind week. And I didn't know that until my late thirties when I started reading books about Buddhism and all the things we want the most calm, patience, compassion, generosity, happiness, whatever that means. These are, these aren't factory settings, non negotiable factory settings. These are skills that can be trained that you can take responsibility for just the way you take responsibility for your body in the gym. And there are lots of ways to train them. We, you know, Jeff and I obviously talk a lot about meditation, but, uh, you're, you've talked about other ways to do it as well from martial arts too, and there's now been a lot of, there's a growing body of research about psychedelics as well. I, uh, it was obvious to me from being in the isolation from the sensory deprivation tank that, that is a training too. There are lots of ways to get at it, but the fundamental good news is you aren't stuck with the patterns that are making you miserable.

Speaker 4:          00:31:09       Yeah, you're not, you're definitely not stuck. And, um, I think that all of these things are related and I think that even running, even a exercise, yoga in particular, all these things that are difficult when you do these difficult things, you're stressing your mind or I should say, don't be stressing your mind, exercising your mind and exercising your body's ability to manage intense situations like yoga poses a very intense, especially hot yoga. It's hard. It's very difficult to very testing and in doing so you, you lessen the stress of regular life. Exactly. You're, you're, you're tied up in a reef knot, you know, you can be economists with this ridiculous pose where you're shaking with exertion than how much more economists can you be. How much more present and open can you be in your life. It's the same thing. Do you think most people

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       bill how to translate what they're learning in something like. So for me that was what broke through about meditation was it was so obvious how to translate what I was learning with my eyes closed to my life. Whereas all the other things, you know, I've been, I had been running since I was in my teens and, and while I, it, it's absolutely good at staving off depression, which I've dealt with for a long time and, uh, and making me feel just generally fit. Uh, I don't know that I was explicitly taking the lessons of running or any of the other things that many people do that they sometimes refer to as their quote unquote meditation now. And applying it to my life. The way was against so obvious.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       Well, it seemed like the obvious aspects of meditation are conscious. Like you're, you're looking for these solutions, whereas with running, you might be getting them without being conscious of them or at least getting some of the benefits of it without being conscious, but those benefits would certainly be enhanced with a different perspective going into the running, like going into the running with the thought process of testing your consciousness to endure this a very difficult thing in front of you like hill running in particular. Um, there's, there's something about anything that's like very uniquely physically stressful like that which requires the mind to stay the course. And in doing so, especially in the other end, once you come out of it, there's this great feeling of euphoria and peace and it's not just a physical release of energy, but it's also an understanding that the brain has exercised the demons that are responsible for the anxiety while you're overcoming this stressful

Speaker 3:          00:33:33       and the limits you told yourself were there. It's funny, you know, my, my, my wife and I've been doing a lot of soul cycle, which I know my wife does it too, but you don't, you don't do it with her. But I,

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       I have other shit to do because I'm a better, I'm a better husband and Joe Rogan,

Speaker 3:          00:33:48       uh, so although in my, she's, she's out in the green room right now raging against me because she's, she's angry because that I'm not at soul cycle right now that I haven't said what I'm about to say, which is that I'm the one who got her into it, so, so in her defense. So, but they are often giving these, the teachers are often giving these really sort of affirmations from the front of the room. And uh, my traditional approach to those is to completely ignore them as incredibly and irretrievably annoying. And however, what they're saying is what you're saying, what they're saying is pedal through your resistance, your telling yourself a story that you can't turn the knob up to the right right now, the resistance knob to the right right now, and stay on the beat and sprint and do all the Greek. You're telling yourself a story. You can't do it, but you actually can do it. Try it. Try it to get over the limiting stories you're telling yourself. And in fact, yesterday morning when we did soul cycle, that guy at the end said something I normally would have ignored, which was next time somebody proposes something to you that you tell yourself you don't want to do, do it. Hence the sensory deprivation tank. Direct link to what he said to my being willing to do it. So there's some there, there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Yeah. There's something about things like soul cycle, even if the right. Even if the motivational speech rings true, you want to like, fuck, this is the problem with spiritual teachers, right? It's a problem with somebody who's, or anybody who walks around that it has the answer. And that's. And it's an. And often the answer can be this sort of pollyanna ish, a Disney channel thing that may, maybe it probably is true on some way, but it's just the delivery of that kind of certainty. That's so annoying. I

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       say that my,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       my, uh, you know, there are millions of meditation books. The only thing new about the books that I write is that I add the word fuck a lot. And, and, and that is a, uh, just a new way to talk about this stuff because our tendency, or at least guys like us, I think where people like us, men and women like us, is to some people when you hear, when you hear this kind of affirmation uttered, you reflectively rejected, which is again normal, but if you can just say it to people and fresh language, it's the reason why these things are cliched, is because they're true and they become cliche through sort of mindless repetition. But if you can find new ways to articulate them, they can land. I think also whether it's your book on meditation or anybody, just life experiences that they're, they're writing down. We gather information from other people's life experiences in a very unique way. And that's one of the reasons why people really enjoy autobiographies. It's one of the reasons why people really enjoy, just truly reflective introspective thinking because we, we can pick out little gems in our self. So even though you might be talking in your meditation book about things that other people have talked about in meditation books, you're talking about it from your unique personal experience and when someone reads that or here's you say it, you get something tangible out of that.

Speaker 3:          00:37:04       Well, we, we talk a lot about, um, so my favorite comedian of all time, other than Joe Rogan is Dave Chappelle. And you, uh, you came on my radar screen because you were on a show, uh, the Chappelle show back in the and the fear factor bit he did years and years ago, which was one of the funniest things I've ever seen a and Chappelle in one of the seasons. Jeff and I were talking about this last night as a matter of fact, talked about, um, how he was doing one of these outtake episodes. I can't remember which season was in because they only did two and a half. He was doing an outtake episode and at the beginning he did a riff about how back in the day African American communities never got the good part of the pig to eat. The white people. Got the good parts of the pig, so, uh, the African Americans had to figure out how to make good food out of snout and that's he said what this episode is going to be, we're going to take the snout and we're going to make good stuff out of it. And my approach to writing books about meditation is the snout is the good stuff. The embarrassing shit that happens to you when you were, when you're meditating is the good stuff. It is what will allow people to see what the practice does for you. So I take the worst, most embarrassing stuff that happens and talk about it because that is gives you a front row seat at what training the mind actually looks like. And if you can't have a sense of humor about how crazy you are, you are truly fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:38:26       I think that those uncomfortable moments are so important for other people to hear about it. Yes, yes, absolutely. We need to know we're not alone. Yes. All our madness.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       What was it like on the set when you were working with Dave Chappelle? It was great. Well, I've known Dan for a long time. I was actually on the very first episode we by chance I was walking through New York and I saw dave and this was before the show had. Even Beth. I didn't even know it existed, but I rented a Bobcat Goldthwait who's there and I'm like, what's up man? What are you guys do? And he's like, he goes, oh, hey joe, we're doing a TV sketch man, you want to be in on it? And I go, I only have like 20 minutes. I'm on my way to a meeting. He goes, here he goes, we're handing out Britain's for New York boobs, and he, I had a box, so it's me and him walking through Manhattan and he's got this crazy fake mustache on and he's like, you've got the best New York boobs, and he would give someone like a ribbon for heaven, New York boobs.

Speaker 4:          00:39:19       And it was really silly but fun. And so I was like, well, Dave's got a show. And then turns out it's the greatest sketch show in the history of the world. And a year later he calls me up again and asked me to do this thing for. They wanted to do a fear factor sketch with tyrone Brigham's. Yeah. So that's me and him. A fresh faced Joe Rogan and Dave Chappelle. The. Yeah. Well this is. What year is it? Three. Four. Yeah. I think it's before that. Is it. I think it's before that. I want to say it's 2002 maybe. Yeah. Because, uh, I wasn't even doing the mantra back then and I was doing that in 2003. So I think it's 2002.

Speaker 3:          00:39:58       The fear factor bit is one of my favorite season two, if I recall. I think so, yeah. And is really one of the, at one of the funniest bits in a show that is, I would argue perhaps the greatest television show of all time. I think it's the greatest sketch comedy show of all time. Something bigger.

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       It's hard to say that though, because if you boiled down a lot of the all time great shows, like in living color or some of the other ones, boy, they had so many seasons. If you boiled them down to two seasons, maybe there will be some, but he's got some sketches that worst just groundbreaking, like the black white supremacist who was blind. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       What about. I was watching last night because jeff and I were talking about Chicago last night, so on the car ride home from this event we did together, I was watching black Bush, which was another I think unbelievably, which released season two where he plays George w dot Bush, his version of Georgia and all the rationales for going into the war in Iraq and it's unbelievably funny.

Speaker 4:          00:41:00       Yeah, he's a genius. He's a real comedy genius, but also a guy who's. You wouldn't get it if you just sort of see him do standup, but he's deeply introspective, like very intensely. Well thought out. You know he's not. He's not a surface guy by any stretch of the imagination.

Speaker 3:          00:41:21       I love them. I really do. I keep thinking that show's going to come back at some point. I'm sure

Speaker 4:          00:41:27       his is. Netflix specials are better. I've seen him unfucked with in. Unless Netflix let them do a Chappelle show where they just left him alone. Then it will be genius, but that was the problem in season three set. I know it was. He was. They were telling him what to say. They were telling them there is so much money involved that they were trying to get him to slightly watered down his content in order to make it more palatable for advertisers. They were asking him, does not say the n word. There was a lot of behind the scenes nonsense that I dealt with the exact same administration and comedy central, so I'm well aware of how silly they were about certain things. They had these corporate ideas and this was also right around the same time Janet Jackson's nipple popped out there in the street ball, which fucking oddly enough, changed everything.

Speaker 4:          00:42:16       People started freaking out about content because of a nipple. Yeah, it was. It was very. It was a very weird time for television and in their defense what they do is they're producers. They're not. They're not creative people. They're executives and they didn't know how to handle how to keep it funny and keep it free and loose, but also figuring out a way to make it fit into what their corporate structure is of what's acceptable and not acceptable for advertising. So it was just a clusterfuck of control and neediness and too many cooks in the kitchen and people's ego where there's a lot of people that just want it to affect the show just so that they can put their greasy fingerprints on it and that's a really common thing with television that that ego aspect of, you know, these different people who are high up on the food chain in the executive world wanting to put their stamp on a show and then talking openly about putting their stamp.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       Well, that was my idea. I thought it was really important. We get dave out there like that and it for him. He was like, fuck this, I'm going to Africa for a couple months and I'm just going to come back and quit. And everybody was like, whoa. But that's who David is. I mean, that's, that's. There's not a lot of people that walk away from $50, million dollars, but he's one of them. He's just like, I don't need to do this. I could. I could do something else. I just do stand up, and he in fact we even weirder, he didn't do standup for a long time and when he did it, he did it for free. He would just show up places like he would show up places with a speaker and plug it into a microphone and a park in Seattle and just start doing standup.

Speaker 4:          00:43:52       There was a lot of stories about like people would just gather around hundreds of people and he would just be doing standup for these random people and they were like, what's going on? How does a guy get to be like that? Just be yourself. That's who he is. But was that you think, is that something. I mean because that sounds to me like somebody who had a practice or something or like or an inner compass that was smoked a lot of weed that maybe that was part of it. He smokes weed all day. I mean if you watch this new netflix specially smoking a vape pen through the entire special to the point where I watched it in like 40 minutes of the special. I started getting anxiety. I'm like, how high are you right now, man? When you said you might, will you hide your Netflix? But yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       Yeah, because you said at the beginning you were baked and I was like, is that a bit or is it.

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       No, I was high but I didn't keep getting high through this special. Like Dave keeps hitting that vape pen and I don't know how strong that vape pen is, but he's like seven, eight, nine, 10 hits deep in 40 minutes in. I'm like, Yo, this kid gets super slippery. Yeah. He just kept pulling out this vape pen. Yeah. I mean it was literally with him through the entire set in his hand.

Speaker 3:          00:45:01       That's increasing the degree of difficulty to this that I would not want to explore. That's what an isolation tank. Yeah, exactly. That's a.

Speaker 4:          00:45:09       But it also, it's freeing in a way because you're so comfortable that experience of like giving into the, to the marijuana, like giving into the, the, the thc where you just sort of like float away on it and don't question it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       But as you were high backstage getting ready to do your netflix special and I would imagine that's a pretty stressful environment because they're taping this thing. It's going to be your special. It's a big deal. Did you not have a moment of like, Holy Shit I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have smoked?

Speaker 4:          00:45:35       No, no, no. It's fun. It's just like, this is like an incredibly privileged position. I find myself in like this whole thing is amazing. So crazy wild ride. So I'm about to do the wildest part of the wild ride film a Netflix special and uh, just, just, just joy, just taking it all in and then going. This is so like, all the hard work is done. The materials in place, the writing has been done, the rehearsals been done, has been hundreds and hundreds of sets. Everything's tightened up and all the notes are in place. And I've run it 100 times. And by the time you saw the film, the Netflix special, it was mostly the fourth show of for taping. So I've already taped three taping so I've already got it in the can. So there's. Most of the pressure is off so it's just like a regular show on.

Speaker 4:          00:46:30       Okay. Yeah. So it's just just happiness. Just let it, let it happen. Now you seem happy while watching it. It was fun. Yeah, it's a good time. But it's one of those weird things where you know, stand up, live standup is, is weird itself because you know you're dealing with all these factors, the people's consciousness. You're, you're trying to manage your material as well as bring them in and make sure that your timing is right and everything is smooth. And then on top of that there's the filming aspect of it. Like this will be locked in and recorded forever. Like this is, this is going to go online and then people will have copies of it and then it will be. This is, this is your material, this is your thought process. Do you have this iron down? Do you have this edited and parsed and sectioned and have you thoroughly examined? Have you used

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       the correct economy of words? Have you. Have you boiled it down into the best possible version of itself?

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       So funny with standup because you watch it as a as A. Because I've never done standup. You watch it as a consumer. It looks casual, it looks off the cuff, it has enormous amount of work that goes into it,

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       but it's both casual and off the cuff and incredibly well thought out and rehearsed and it has to be both of those things but don't you have to. So you prepare like crazy, you know you got that, but then when you're actually there, isn't there a certain amount of having to let go and try and be actually responsive to what's happening in the audience to a. That must be the skill. It's like you do the preparation so you can almost let go of. Yeah, this both, you know, like you have to be prepared but you also have to be loose and you have to be completely engrossed in what you're talking about, but also in the moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's tricky, but the bottom line is when it's done it's worth it. Like all the weirdness of like when you get it done or something like triggered.

Speaker 1:          00:48:33       When it was done, I finished it. I was like, I did it. Like this is what I wanted to do. Like I wanted to, I wanted to accurately represent a real live standup comedy set that feels like any other set that you could catch me in San Francisco on a Saturday night. And so it was that. So it's all worth it. Yeah, it felt like that. Yeah. So then I waited about a year, then I start doing it again and now I'm in the process. A couple more months I'll do it again now. It sounds a lot like actually the experience of teaching you're teaching meditation sort of like because you got to be, you kind of got to know you have to have experienced and sort of know your stuff, but the other hand you actually got to be super open to exactly what's coming up and what someone's describing or what's happening and you've got to be.

Speaker 1:          00:49:17       And so if you. If you try to bear down too hard on that, then you're just going to be repeating your own shit back again. So can you be a. had that total openness to actually see what it is that someone is saying and not have not have your. Put your projections on it, but you have to have also done your homework in a way and it's just having that balance and then there's that really this beautiful thing where you're kind of. You get into flow when you're kind of in the zone and it just like you hardly even know the words are coming out or responses happening and it's not. It's not remotely deliberate at all, but it's the right thing in that moment or the right thing that someone needed to hear or you needed to hear and it feels incredible. It feels like it feels effortless, but it's the effortlessness that comes out of preparedness. Previous effort. Yeah. Yeah. You have to have both. You can't just wing it, right? You have to be prepared, but you also have to be able to just be flexible in the moment and to be able to ride the.

Speaker 3:          00:50:09       It comes back to the word that we started with his surrender. Yeah, and I noticed this a lot because I do a lot of traveling around and giving speeches and I'm always about meditation and I'll have my little shtick that I do, but then I will open it up for questions and actually the same thing is true for when I'm live on good morning America. You know where I have to. If I'm in my head, if I'm thinking about what I should say or how things should go, I make the worst mistakes. If I can get myself to surrender and just be there. I've been playing with that a little bit even in the course of this discussion, uh, as a big podcast. Don't screw it up. Say that. Don't say that they'll do the dumb thing that, you know, whatever, blah, blah, blah. Actually, if I can just like, let all of that chatter go away, play itself out. Then you have a better conversation. Then you say the thing that you couldn't have planned.

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       Yeah, that is the art of the podcast is the art of conversation in general is to get out of your own way and to be able to also at the same time find the right words, articulate the right thoughts, figuring out the right way to the piece, the sentences together. So it's both entertaining and engaging but also rings true and there's not a, an, a, an air of bullshit to it or a ego to it or you know, because people can. There's a unique thing about a conversation, especially with people interacting with each other that people they tune in to like. And I tune into it like if I listen to certain conversations with people that I find awkward and I'm like, well, what is uncomfortable about this? What is this weird? And see it. A lot of times it boils down to like one person trying to be too much in control. Absolutely that. Yeah. Or yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       personally I'm usually that person.

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       Yeah, everybody is. And you can tell when you're hanging out with that person because it's like there's this grippiness or, or when I have that, it's like your study, fearful usually word and you're, you're trying to hold onto the narrative and it just creates this unnatural nus. Yeah. And then everyone's got a little bit, it feels a little bit weird and then someone's trying to overcompensate with someone over here and it just wrecks the whole flow of it. You know, when I first started reading a little bit about that

Speaker 3:          00:52:21       Zen Buddhism, which one of the flavors of. They talk a lot about spontaneity. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't quite zen bounced. I didn't quite get that, but this is what we're talking about actually. If they also use this word freshness, that if you can get rid of the stale planned canned stuff and just touch in on what's happening right now, which is fresh, uh, than the spontaneity arises.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       Can I? There's um, uh, so I got a teacher, this Guy Shin Zen young, who I think is the, the fucking bomb. You've got to get them on. This is amazing. He is incredible. He is truly amazing. He's a super nerd consciousness and he is really articulate about the dynamics and he's trained a lot within the zen tradition but also in kind of old school theravada like the more strict sue's name, s h I, z e and Canadian, sorry, z e and Shin Zen young. And he actually likes Ms Dot Martial Arts and he guides people while watching mixed martial arts in his undershirt. And he's the, he's the wicked too.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       Yeah, I, I can fully that. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       he, uh, but he talks a lot about something called the zen bounce because he's, he's interested in how, like, how, you know, how do these different practices from different traditions work? Like how do they, what is the way in which they for you or they reduce your suffering and and because they can look so different on paper or actually inexperienced, so you might have one kind of meditation tradition. It's all about just sitting with your eyes closed, not moving all about that kind of stoicism and then you when you do move, it's very slow and deliberate and you got to be mindful and all that stuff, but then you have other traditions like within a certain kinds of schools where you're actually. If you it's frenetic. It's like go, go, go all the time. You're moving fast. You're like unwrapping your shit and you put your shit back together and you're eating your food in a particular kind of way and you got to get to this thing over here and you gotta get this thing over here and then you got to sit next to stop on a dime.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       And what they're doing is they're deliberately shaking things up there. Deliberately creating all this agitated and energy to teach you how to ride the energy to teach you how to be calm enough in the center that you can add that energy turns into spontaneity, turns into creativity, turns into genuine being available in the moment. This as opposed to being stuck in some way. That's what's getting trained. And when you see these guys from those monasteries are from those traditions who are really, who practice a lot, they've got this bouncy available, turn on a dime, do this, you know, it's like they're just available to what's going on because they've trained that quality in their experience. It's gotten out of their own way. They've gotten out of their own way. I mean, and they would, I mean Shin Zahn when you talked to how he is, he, you know, I've had like hundreds of hours of discussions where I'll call him up, I'll be like.

Speaker 1:          00:54:58       And He, the best thing about him is he'll answer the phone if he's ready to talk, he's ready to serve, you know, whatever you got going on. I'll be like a column in the morning, Shins in. So what's going on right now? What's your experience of consciousness? And he basically describes, you know, it's like he's just there and it's like he's sort of part of this upwelling of the world and it's all kind of vibrating up through him. He has no center, you know, he asked him where his center. He experiences the center of himself. Sometimes it's over here, sometimes it's over on the right and he's just like, yeah, it's just, it's all reality. Just this free flow of reality that he's just responding to now and then. And then he'll tell me this is the shit that would blow my mind. Cause you're like, okay, that sounds awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:55:36       But he's like, no, there's challenges for him. The challenge is, is taking condition seriously, taking condition seriously. He has to convince himself that went to, you know, that the stakes are high enough that he should work on this thing or that. Yeah, I guess I should go to the way that bus. You know, it's like, I mean he will because his instincts kick in, but it's like he's so in the uncondition that, you know, he, his danger is just becoming one of those dudes sitting on a mountain and not doing anything but the world is fucked and it needs people like him who can help us out. So he, he, and he's very inspired to, to, to try to do his best to be a great meditation teacher. But that's his battle. He's no longer so most practitioners, their battle is trying to get to taste that more unconditioned quality, the spontaneous, that free the yourself as just a process.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Uh, his, his, the other direction. He's gone so far into that now he's trying to remember what it was like to be a human being. He's more like a cosmic rock, like there's the vibrating into infinity all the time, which is great for stress but not so great for maybe other things. Very interesting. Yeah. So he's just been doing this for so long that she is very high level of. He's another Jewish guy from this case, from Los Angeles. He was born in the forties or fifties, Eisenhower, America, and he basically was way into Japan, Japanese culture, learn Japanese as a teenager. I went to Japanese school and then went to Japan when he was like 19 or 20 and decided he wanted to study these. Uh, some of the Zen practitioners eventually got in with a, uh, uh, what's called the Japanese have Adrianna school.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       So it's sort of a particular school of Buddhism. Started training with them and then that was never finished. He was getting a phd program. Do hardcore stuff like that. You have an ice baths and things like that? Yeah, yeah. I mean, so it's all what we're talking about, building up resilience building and back when emily, can you sit in these seriously? I mean they do the in Japan they do the thing called, he'll talk about this. The marathon monks were basically these guys sit for like no joke for days on end days not going to the bathroom, not moving, not eating, not drinking water. I mean, it's hard to imagine how it would even be possible, but apparently it's a televised event on in Japan. Like they do these long walks and then they do these sets and these guys, it's all about what shinzen would say.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       It's about recycling the reaction, so it's all about your hub, these responses in your body, you're feeling uncomfortable, you're feeling hungry, you're feeling this stuff, but if you can bring enough equity and openness to those sensations, then they just. And I had this happen to me thousands of times meditating or the sensation just boils off. It just goes from being pain in your need to just vibrating, feels like maggots squirming and then it just wouldn't, it just. And it's all about how, how completely present can you be. You can metabolize anything stuck and guess what? You can metabolize stuck physical stuff too. So if you put your attention on a knot in the back of your, you know, in the back of your shoulder or something. I've had to experience in meditation where I'm just feeling this tension in my body and I just hold my attention there long enough and this sort of, oh, in this open way, not trying to make a change.

Speaker 1:          00:58:44       Just curious about it. Looking at it. I've had the experience of knots, like desolving were like an actual impingement or a physical thing that seemed to change. Now that's really weird because then you realize, wow, look the mind, the mind and body, it's all part of one process, you know, and at part of what was keeping that tension, there wasn't just the problem in the muscle. There was some part of me that was keeping it there. There was some way in which I was holding onto it a little bit, like holding my breath a bit, you know, or like when you said about releasing layers of tension and you sit down on a meditation cushion and you think you're relaxed and you realize you're actually kind of uptight and you're like, and then you let go of that and then you and you said a little bit more than you realize there's another layer of tension and you can just let go and let go and let go.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       And it just seems to go on and on and on. And it's like, that can be. I mean there's some. I know another teacher only teaches is lying down. She teaches people, Reggie Ray, go to a Dota, go to his meditation, resets. You just, you're laying on the ground. You're not doing anything. You could fall asleep, doesn't matter for a month. He just laying on the ground and he's teaching you how to actually land on the ground. You could spend a week, two weeks learning how to actually lay on the ground. You think you're laying on the ground where you're still a little bit tense. You're still a little bit holding yourself up in some way and it's like you're just letting go of those layers and letting go of those layers until you're just like a pool. It's funny because everyone, we all know that we need conscious awareness.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       We need the to be here and present, but also that thinking of conscious awareness and the control that we try to enact on our environment and all the different ways that the ego forces us to think and pushes us and nudges us. He really is about getting out of your own way. In a lot of ways, like it's a paradox to because the only way to truly surrender to reality is to not fucking care. It's absolutely true, but, and that's what's going to free you up to be the most effective in your caring. You cannot get around that head fuck because it is. Absolutely. That is absolutely true. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:00:52       so we would, I mean this is the thing that people really struggle with because a lot of people here will hear everything you just said and you know, and all this stuff about Shinzen, you know, not caring and think, okay, if I meditate, well I'm going to be ineffective. I'm not going to be able to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       But that's what I'm saying is the paradox. It's like the person who's most effective as the person who gives up needing to be effective. It's like you because that's how you free up all the energy. It's like if you're trying to control everything all the time, you're going to be really limited in what you can actually do. If you just let go and let things be as they are, you're kind of like, it's like you're conserving all this deep, deep well of energy that's there and then when you really do need to make a move because it does fucking matter, then you've got the energy to act and you act in a way that's probably more effective because it's less distorted, so it's just skillful use of energy and that's actually, that's what I've learned from practice and even from getting older because I'm 46 now and I don't have the energy I used to have.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       It's like choosing your battles and didn't seem like now I'm like, that seems really tiring. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to actually just sit here and chill and relax so I'll have the energy to do what I need to do when I need to do it. That's kind of that maturity is sort of, I think a big part of the. The meditative like learning. Well, so it's so interesting what you're talking about as well as it relates to like how when you're on good morning America, like just sort of figuring out a way to just be in the moment and guide the conversation, but don't think too much about what you're saying, but say the

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       right things and have poignant things and good questions and being able to engage but not being too conscious of how it sounds or what you're trying to achieve by your words or the image that you're trying to portray. It's, it's. There's so many parallels that would exist in standup comedy of that exist in podcasting. They exist in martial arts like when you're doing martial arts. That's a big part of being able to train effectively is to focus almost entirely on the movements themselves. To have them trained into a way where there a pathway that you can almost observe like you. You're the observer and a passenger. As much as you're the driver of the experience that it's all just sort of taking place and when you start tweaking and freaking out about it, that's when everything tightens up and that's when you start to run into all these real issues with training.

Speaker 3:          01:03:15       Well, that's why I find basic. You know, we've talked a lot about. Jeff has talked as he always does, very beautifully about deep end of the pool, you know, mysticism and highly attained meditators, but the, the, the nuts and bolts, basic application of beginners, mindfulness meditation, which Jeff and I talk about is what allows you to get out of your own way. Because saying to people, Hey, get out of your own way. Get Out of your head is a very frustrating thing to hear because you're like, how the hell do I do so? But the basic, the basic move of, of what? Of of beginner meditation, which is to sit with your eyes closed. Bring your full attention to the feeling of your breath coming in and going out, and then as soon as you try to do this, your mind is going to go bonkers.

Speaker 3:          01:04:04       You're going to start thinking about, you know, what's for lunch, where do I need a haircut, where did dribbles run wild, blah, blah, blah, and the whole game is just to notice when you've become distracted in a nonjudgmental, friendly way. Oh yeah, that's anger. That's random thoughts, whatever. Let it go. Go back to the breath over and over and over ad Infinitum, and that basic bicep curl for your brain allows you to have a less hostile relationship to your inner chaos, allows you to see it clearly, and that is the mechanism by which all have for me, at least by which all of the things we're talking about here. You're not freaking out on live television being able to survive in a sensory deprivation tank when you think Joe Rogan my judge you for freaking out and jumping out all that stuff. It allows you to see the chatter arise. This basic move that we're doing in meditation, which is just sitting back and allowing all of this stuff to come up without trying to grab it or push it away, can help you in the things that we're talking about here. Martial arts, standup comedy, all of the things. So, uh, can I just say something about what, where it turned a corner for me when I was practicing because I was terrible meditator. Um, and it was, it was understanding the actual skills that we're. And that's

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       the thing I think that links all what we're talking about here. When you talk about martial arts, when you talk about being a broadcaster and you talked about comedy, talk about practice. It's like there are particular kinds of mind body skills that we're training and those skills are actually. They have names. There's a feeling of that that's happening that you can experience when you're training that muscle group. And that was when I started understanding things that way because the Shin Zen because he talks about it that way, but Buddhism talks about it that way. What the factors of awakening that you're building up concentration, which is your capacity just to pay attention to what you want to pay attention to. It's like a commitment. Your mind wanders, you bring it back. That's one skill. You're building up clarity, which is your ability to be clear and make the sermons, but what's happening in your experience, what's happening in a social experience?

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       Is this the right time to say this thing? What's happening inside me, like what am I really feeling and versus how my acting, you know like so dialing up that resolution dial and building up equanimity, which is just the can actually not fight with my experience as it's unfolding. Can I have this centeredness in the middle of what's going on? Whether I'm doing martial arts, whether I'm doing comedy, whether I'm doing meditation, the beauty of meditation practices, it makes explicit what those skills are in a simple situation with your eyes closed. You can notice when you're being concentrated, when you're being clear, when you're being honest with you, being friendly, which is another good skill, like you notice when that's happening and because you notice when it's happening, you can start to notice how to apply it in every other area of your life, so that's all it is.

Speaker 1:          01:06:48       All practices is about being explicit and deliberate about what qualities of existence of being that you want to train in your life and then you just try to apply it everywhere, and so that's why you can get people who are. I see them as basically meditation masters on a comedy stage or people who are basically meditation masters in the sports arena or in the, in a, in a cage match or whatever it is. They're applying the same principles. So all these are paths that can bring you into more of a, a more presence in your life. And the problem comes when people started saying, no, but my path was a good path. Oh yeah, but I teach meditation. That's more fundamental, or no, no, no, no, but I do a body practice. This is more fundamental. It's like it's about the skills. Those are what's fundamental. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       Yeah. And the more you can concentrate on that, the more you'll enjoy this weird experience. The mystery of this. It's this weird experience that doesn't have an owner's manual. Yes. Do it. That's one of the things that's always freaked me out about the mind and the body. It's like you have this incredible vehicle and this amazing resource that's sort of operating this vehicle and no one, no one gets a manual and you're taught how to handle it by people that don't know what the fuck they're doing, whether it's teachers in school or whether it's the kids that you grow up with or maybe even perhaps your parents or sports coaches. You get shitty operating advice. They're grinding the gears and banging into trees and no one knows how to handle this

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       thing.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Correct. Particularly in our culture. You know, I mean, one of the points that Sam Harris mutual friend of ours, great podcasts are great writer, has made in his book waking up, which was one of his many books, but I think my favorite is that, you know, in the West we've developed an intellectual and scientific culture that is really robust and as changed the world and is in unquestionably valuable, but in the east they actually were working on the owner's manual for the mind for Millennia. You know, you got to Buddha statues in here 2,600 years ago, this guy, if he even existed or what do we don't we don't know, but this culture of Buddhism and before that the Hindus were working on how do you operate this mind? What is this mind? And uh, I think the beautiful thing we're watching now globally, this trend is the meeting of these two things and jeff is one of the people is most excited about. This is partly why we're such good friends. The meeting of this western scientific rational culture and this eastern exploration of the mind.

Speaker 1:          01:09:22       But birla I want to just call you on something like I think, I think that's absolutely true, but I also think these, the, these, this understanding, this way of thinking about it is there in the West as well, that it's like the east is made it explicit in very particular ways. But even within humanistic traditions, if you look at like the, some of the Greek philosophers who are, a lot of them are really mystics. If you look within the abrahamic traditions, there are, these understandings are there as well. And they're describing it in similar ways and like you hang out with some bad ass Catholic priest who spent his entire life like in poor neighborhoods, helping people out and like totally being present and working on service and at the way in which that human being has learned how to survive and is learn how to flourish and learn how to be present for his community or her community. It's a lot of the same skills and did not. There's obviously shadowy aspects everywhere too. But you know, these are human universals.

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       That's right. And there's a book, there's just to being a bad ass priest. There's a book called Tattoos on the heart, which was written by the guy who wrote, ran homeboy industries here in la. And He, as far as I know, doesn't have any meditation practice, but he talks about it. This is a bit of a sappy word, but compassion, you know, at actually giving a shit about other human beings about whom very few other people give a shit. And his whole life is the organizing principle is taken care of. These gang members, uh, who's, who have had, who've been discarded by their family's, grown up with parents who were in prostitution or drugs or whatever and had no shot and this guy, his whole life has given them a shot and if that's not a living this stuff out, then I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       Why do we think compassion is the sappy word? I'm just wondering because I know that it's so common to have those responses. Like what does that do you think

Speaker 3:          01:11:11       problem with that we were talking with soul cycle before,

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       you know, when they, it's the presentation, you know, when you eat it, it's through repetition. It loses its meaning and then sometimes you get the sense, I get the sense at least they would. The people who were saying this to me have no idea what it is they're saying or why. Yeah. The Co op, they're clunky now. They're just a signaling their tribal allegiance to a Unicorns or something. By just repeating these phrases are really embodying what they mean or something. Right. Like the people that say that, I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual. Yeah. Right. And they say that you let go Christ. On the other hand, I hear that I just hear somebody who's trying to connect these principles and doesn't want to necessarily identify with some of these structured forms of religion that, that are, that all these fucking problems. Sometimes it's that and sometimes it's just weird people that are just making noises with their face because they want you to think a certain way about that.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       Making noises with your face. But now thing that people do where they're just really just saying noises that they, they hear other people say and they're not connected to them and you feel they're not connected to them. So you just kind of waiting it out. So it's hypocrisy. The hypocrisy that makes you want to puke because it's a disconnect between what's real, which. Because you know it's real because you can feel their body language and then what they're saying, which is the opposite. But even when it's real. I mean, this was my problem when I first started getting into meditation. Even when it's real, there's an earnestness, there's a lack of sense. If there's a sadness, a saccharin about the presentation of these really fresh, amazing, invigorating ideas that, that I, I, this is why I wanted to write a book with you because you talk about these things in ways they got me interested as opposed to sometimes the preciousness, it's precious and I had this beautiful little box that I'm going to unfold for you and it's like, and it's so holy and perfect and it's just like this whole thing around just makes me want to fucking vomit as soon as they get anywhere near it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:03       Yeah. It's like certain yoga teachers can say the exact same thing and it's calming and when they say no a you say it back you totally. Exactly. And then the other ones say, I like, will you please shut the fuck up buddy? So I have a, I have a trainer that I work with, this bad ass woman named jade. Jade Alexis, who was a former j dot j dot Alexis, former golden gloves boxer. And she's just, I, I would take spin classes from her, not like just straight up spinning classes. You would just get in your face. Turn up your resistance dial for you while you're in the middle of a sprint is just a total bad ass and so I started working with her one on one. She is the first person who got me to do yoga because when she says not mistake, I'll say it right back to her. Yeah. Yeah. I used to take yoga from this guy from South Africa. He was amazing and he would say all the things that you would hate most coming out of insincere people, but you knew he really believed it and he also was one of the rare guys and I've ran into a few people that do this, that run a donation only yoga class, which was fascinating for because I would watch these

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       people pull in in a Mercedes and not donate and take classes for free and leave and I'm like, this is amazing. It's amazing to watch like how many people take advantage of that and it's amazing that the concept of it is the purest expression of yoga. You can get totally like give what you can. I'm not gonna charge you anything. I'm not. That's not what this is about, this is about the yoga itself and if people contribute enough, I can continue to do this and we could pay the rent and he managed to keep the place open that way because he was so good and it was so real.

Speaker 1:          01:14:45       Many meditation teachers operate this way, many of them. That's how the CCO nation owning. Yeah, it's great if it could work, right. It's. That's how kind of it should be. Yeah. We have A. I have a group in Toronto called the consciousness explorers club that my friend James and I started like eight years ago or something and we try to do that principle and the idea is that every week we get together and we explored it and practices and we explore. Then we do a part two so we might, which is like a social practice or interactive or body practice and the whole thinking is basically like we want it to be kind of one stop shopping. That whoever you are, whatever your background and how much money you have, you can come once a week to this place and it will cost you nothing. If you have no money, it'll cost you.

Speaker 1:          01:15:28       The sliding scale is 10 to 20. If you have money, you'll get the absolute best of what we can do with guest teachers. You know, every Monday is a different set of programming and that's. And that's what we'll do and we'll do that as much as we can for you and it's like. And then you can go home and do go back to your life and if you need referrals for more help there potentially there, but this idea that once a week anywhere in any community in the world, you can just go to a place where you could get the best and it's affordable. There's no reason that can't happen because there are so many skilled practitioners out there and teachers and facilitators and different modalities and it's just exploding across the board like psychotherapies, exploding meditations exploding like body therapy based therapies are exploding like insights about a house, sports, how sports work, how the mind body works, exploding. So there's all this diet stuff, movement stuff, all this expertise out there and it just needs to way. We wanted to create a framework where we could start to channel some of that expertise, you know, get together and have an adventure, explore what this particular modality has to say and then and then do it all in communities. You get that community support. Yeah. Well I think that's good with everything. I think having these shared

Speaker 2:          01:16:35       differences and sort of relating, what are the hiccups that you found along the way? What are the pitfalls? How have you overcome those? There's, there's great value to that. Whether it's in meditation or we use that in comedy a lot. There's a lot of like one of the great things about communities like the comedy stores that we get together and talk about the pitfalls like yeah, I'm in the middle of the set and I'm on the, on some of them in my own head and then I'm realizing this bit's kind of clunky and I'm trying to get out of it and like, ah, what do you do? Like a group therapy for sure. Yeah. There's a lot of that. Like one of the things that's really interesting about standup in general today as opposed to in the past, is that the consciousness of it is sort of shifted. In the past, it used to be a very solitary pursuit and everybody was sort of fighting in a scarcity mindset. There was a famine thinking mindset that there's only a certain amount of slots on sitcoms. There's a certain amount of host jobs for late night talk shows and there's only certain amount of jobs are comics, certain amount of clubs to work at. Well now there's so many clubs to work at so many theaters on top of the clubs. There's all these internet places where you can do podcasts and there's so many different avenues that comics don't feel this famine mindset anymore and it's much more of an open and supportive community.

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Do you think that in part is driven by the fact that there are more women in comedy as well and they they, they can sometimes bring a little more civilized approach?

Speaker 2:          01:18:06       No, I think that's true that they do do that in a lot of ways, but no, that's not what it is. I think it's a lack of scarcity, it's structural and it's also more people who have meditated, who have explored their consciousness, who, who are aware of the pitfalls of the ego entering into comedy and then more people sort of fostering that idea of community through. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:18:33       I was surprised there. I know a reasonable amount of comedians and some of them have come on my podcast today to talk about how meditation helps them in what they do. Millennials in particular, it's great. Yeah. Really good. Very funny and very nice guy. You kind of realized that the comic, the comic is kind of like the canary in the coal mine because the comedians are really sensitive, right? I mean that's kind of part of what it means to be a comedian is to be sensitive to noticing cues and subtleties and things in the culture that other people overlook, so it's not okay. Because what I hear you saying is it's almost like some of the most, like, I hate this word, but evolved or mature people out there. Professionals in the world are creative people in the world or people in that comedy community because they had that sensitivity and they've had to learn how to work together in some way. I mean, it's an interesting. Maybe they're like, there's something we could learn from that population, you know, if we look around and saying who can we learn from? Is there something in Comedians and the way they're doing things that other people can learn from and what and what is it? Can we distill those lessons, you know? Well, I think a lot of, a lot of

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       ways it's an exploration of the mind, you know, and I think comedy is an exploration of the mind, not just in your own mind but also in how do you relay those thoughts to other people and the most efficient way possible. And a lot of that has to do with how much have you managed your own mind and your own ability to communicate and meditation can greatly assist you in that regard. Do you do any meditation? Yeah, I meditate. What's your practice like? Well, I do a bunch of different things. One, I do a lot of yoga, breathing exercises and do them by myself were essentially just completely concentrating on the breath, just breathing in and breathing out and forcing out all the thoughts and allowing them to come in and then allowing them to leave and I like to do that also inside the tank, like one of the things that I really like to do is get myself into a position where I've settled in the tank and then just completely concentrate on my breath and just just concentrate entirely on the breathing in and breathing out and get it into this almost like hypnotic cycle of breathing in and breathing out.

Speaker 2:          01:20:38       And it's the same thing. There's going to be all these different thoughts. Like a, you know, I'm itchy. I should scratch my nose. And I'm like, uh, maybe I should cut this down to an hour instead of two hours like I planned or you know, I really need to go running instead of going to yoga tomorrow, maybe I should switch. You got to let those go. They come in, they come out and just the breathing being this consistent thing that I can always go back to concentrating on.

Speaker 1:          01:21:04       Yeah, I mean that is, that's it you just described. I do a practice almost exactly like that. It actually enhances the tank. Well, it's interesting. I was just going to say that I was trying to figure out what I was noticing my breath, like what am I noticing here? Um, I might actually feeling the breath or might just hearing the breath come in through the nose and just identifying that was actually a little bit interesting. It actually boosted my level of attention to the breath when I decided to go in that direction. Yeah, it's,

Speaker 2:          01:21:33       it's both. I mean, you're hearing it, you're feeling it, but it's just the act of it, you know, the thing that doing it, they're doing it and they're like this sort of like hypnotic in and out thing that happens when you have no sensory input whatsoever. You're not feeling your feet on the ground. You feel weightless. You're not hearing anything and not seeing anything. It's just a particularly effective environment for exploring your.

Speaker 1:          01:21:57       There's an expression sometimes this feeling of our inexperience of being breezed, so it's like you're not. You're no longer doing the breathing. The breathing is just happening. It's like you're being breathed by a giant cosmic lung. It's like that, that you know, that feeling that you're talking about letting go try to do that in the tank and it's just like you. You just let go of any sense of that. There's a dewar and it just that you just start to taste yourself as this process, this thing that's just happening, you know in a bird is passing outside.

Speaker 2:          01:22:29       Clouds are passing and someone's walking across the street talking on their phone and you're being breathed and it's all just one system that's just happening. It's also interesting too, when I'm in the tank, I lose the sense of what is up and what's down here. Like you lose like what? When you're lying there and you're floating, you kind of lose this. Everything seems like all over the place, but in the thought of relaxing and letting go, it's always going down. It's always like a deeper thing. It's always like settling in more, settling more. It always seems to go towards back, like you're

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       just sinking in deeper and deeper and deeper. It's one of the only times we have a sensation of a very particular direction that you're going in.

Speaker 3:          01:23:13       I found that direction, listening of it that initially was quite scary for me that I was aware it, but my moving or is this inner ear stuff, you know, like it was just flying. But, but I, I didn't experience that as a soaring. I experienced it as more terrifying. Do we, do we do we have footage of Dan Klein the inside of the tank? It's a practice, man. I, I, I see the value. I mean, another thing that actually kind of reminds me of my last meditation retreat where we're talking about physical discomfort. My teacher and I and because I was experiencing a lot of physical pain from long sitting for a long time, pain comes up and I was asking, you know, is it okay for me to quit at some point just because it's pains too intense? And He. Joseph was arguing, you know, I think you want to test your limits on this. Obviously at some point you're going to get up, but you want to, we're, we're gradually increasing the amount that we can stand and that to me seems very similar to the value that I can perceive of getting back in the sensory deprivation tank of being able to be with that fear a little bit more, test the limit a little bit more consistently so that I'm a so that my world isn't getting smaller.

Speaker 4:          01:24:26       People echo that same sentiment when it comes to psychedelics.

Speaker 3:          01:24:29       Right? That was the next test for belonging, very interested. There's a lot of, as you know, there's been a growing body of research into the salutary effects of psychedelics and a lot of it's being done at Nyu on cancer cancer patients who have anxiety, but there's also some specific work being done at Johns Hopkins on meditators and uh, and psilocybin. What kind of effect to psilocybin have on meditators and in Kenya in a way, show them directionally where you want to be moving in your meditative practice. And I've had a longstanding desire to get into this study, my shrink and my wife strongly argue that I shouldn't. Somebody with my kind of brain chemistry who had, has to go on and perform under pressure when the red light's on, on TV. Probably not a great idea to dose myself with psychedelics, but this is something that I've been wrestling with.

Speaker 3:          01:25:22       What are you worried about? What that looks like? What do you think is gonna happen is right back to the. My worries in the tank. And Timmy, I was thinking a lot about psychedelics and I've had, you know, when I was a kid and, and would smoke weed, I would have panic attacks. And I think it's about the desire for control of the ego. The thinking mind moves is, and it's, it's like a vampire confronted with garlic, you know, it's just my ego's spoiling and can't handle the lack of control. And it's not just the entity energy

Speaker 4:          01:25:51       of those experiences that's so intense where you just have no control over it, but it's also, it just blows apart your worldview. Like you had this idea that you think, oh, you think you know what's really going on, and then you have one of those experiences and it just shows you that you don't anything well

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and you are there, you think you are, you that there's some solid you there and that that is called into question fundamentally.

Speaker 1:          01:26:10       Yeah, but it's humbling to be shown that all your, your ideas about how you think things are just that you know, that it's just like that you don't know. Fuck all. And that has been, that's my experience from doing, doing that stuff. It's like I just shows me that I'm just, you know what? Just sit back to sit back and, and let nature do what nature's going to do.

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       Can you say sit back dude, when there's no dude there,

Speaker 1:          01:26:35       when that's what you're starting to see and you get exploded. So it basically you're going to. It's a win win situation. Either you win because you're able to stay super aquinas with a greater and greater intensity of what you're experiencing under a trip or you win because you don't stay economists. You fight with it and you get ripped to shreds and in that humbling moment you that isn't itself is deeply consoling and healing both. I think it's like both sides of that are are positive. It's like a net positive gain on both sides of that. That's how I legitimated you know, when I'm getting ripped apart. Yeah. Getting ripped apart. Yeah, it does. See you see what I'm worried about. Yeah, that's what I'm worried about. Yeah. I think it was just relax. It'll be fun.

Speaker 3:          01:27:18       Yeah, I know, but that's one of those things like get it onto your. When people say relaxed or get out of your own way for somebody as tightly wound as me, it's a frustrating thing to hear because it's hard for me to have

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       racial gotta resist that clench. Resist the clench. Just let it go. Sometimes you do get ripped apart. Yeah. Oh you. Most of the time if you do it right, heroes dose. So that's part of the thing about it though, is you're supposed to thing heroes does. Terence Mckenna? Yeah. Yeah. I got five dried grams. That was seven to seven if you're interested, but five dried grams is the recommended threshold. Yeah. That's a different kind of emotional experience. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:28:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:28:02       Um, I think it's one of those things where if you test yourself slowly but surely in those waters, you'll get more and more accustomed to the feeling of relaxation and letting go and that treat it like it's a shamonic experience. Like it's a very deep intensive search to the very meaning of your existence and don't, don't think of it as like, oh my God, I'm about to do drugs. Right. But

Speaker 3:          01:28:32       there's. They're not dissimilar in the way that when you don't know up from down when you have no sensation of your body anymore. That is exposing the fundamental, the fundamental fact that Jeff has. Jeff has used as this description over and over I think quite beautifully throughout this discussion, which is that we aren't as solid as we think. We are. In fact, a process and the dude, you're trying to console the dude. It's okay that dude or do that. There's no there, there and that I could see myself going in that direction in the tank that's inexorably where it takes you and that is where psychedelics take you. And again, I'm in, I have, I'm in this weird position because I'm deeply interested in that experience and I've tasted in my own meditation for sure. So scared. Yeah, I mean this is where meditation goes. If we're seeing that your, that the you, that you've been defending and protecting since sentience actually doesn't exist is I think ultimately very liberating really is the true liberation. But seeing it initially as a, as a, um, as a newbie is it tears apart as Jeff says, your worldview, the world, our worldview is based on us at the center. It's a death experience. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 4:          01:29:56       So it seems to me it's like you want to learn how to swim, but you really only interested in calf high water because if you, if you really want to learn how to swim, what happens is they take you out on a jet ski to the middle of the ocean. They go jump off, dude, you're, you're, you're now in the center of the ocean and that's the psychedelic trip. The psychedelic trip is you are fucking swimming, right? There's no if, ands, or buts. You must keep going or you're going to drown.

Speaker 3:          01:30:23       I think there are different approaches based on different people because I think you're exactly right that I want to swim, but my tendency is to stick to the CAF high water, but you're from what I know about you having spent a little bit of time with you and just follow following you, you're kind of a baller, like you're ready to go out on the jet ski and jump in or do all this crazy stuff that traditionally. I mean, I have done some crazy things that we discussed, but traditionally I'm more cautious and I think for somebody with my kind of brain chemistry, somebody whose brain is very good at panicking, I think there's a more step wise approach, which is what I'm intrigued by, which is what we're, we keep discussing, which is test those limits time and again, keep testing them. Don't, don't let up.

Speaker 3:          01:31:05       For example, for example, uh, my shrink, the one who got me to stop doing drugs after I had a panic attack on television and helped me, you know, Kinda straighten myself out. I had a panic attack or the beginnings of a panic attack on a subway. I'm about five years ago. And it was, for me, it was devastating because I was like, this is such a setback. Um, I'm right back at stage one. I'm and my world is gonna get smaller again. So I went to go see him kind of on an emergent basis and he laid out a plan, which is not his original idea. This is actually the way you treat these things called exposure therapy where he said, okay, here for the next 10 days I want you to go stand on the subway platform every day just for a couple of minutes. And then for the 10 days after that, I want you to get on a subway or a car and then get off before the door closes, five, five to 10 days. And then after that I want you to get on and go one. And basically he got me back on the subway because I was able to gradually get through. I'm not Joe Rogan from my. I would never be able to host a show called fear factor the way you did with that, unless it was a completely different show where you know, you're not getting in a tank full of torrential is on the first day, you know, I have to do in a step wise progression because that's the way my brain is wired. Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:32:22       To me that there's going to be different ways for folks to do it. They're definitely as did you, were you exposed to a lot of difficulty when you were young? Did you have to overcome physical adversity? Did you participate in any one on one sport

Speaker 3:          01:32:38       or anything like that? I think the problem was just the opposite, that I had two incredibly loving former hippie parents. I was a bit of a spoiled kid and Jeff and I have talked about this, that, uh, to the extent that I experienced anger or frustration. Oh, sorry. It's because I'm not getting what I want. Yeah. But I did do some competitive sports. I just wasn't very good at it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:03       So do you guys have you guys heard of somatic experiencing? So sematic experiencing. It's the super interesting a way of addressing trauma that is starting to get really influential in the body work community and psychotherapists and psychiatrists and psychologists are starting to look at it and there's a bunch of good papers out about it, but basically the thesis, it comes from being really a guy named Peter Levine who spent a lot of time looking at animal behavior. And what he noticed is that when animal goes into a fight or flight situation, um, they. So you're a gazelle and all of a sudden there's the tiger and then you go, you just exploded to action. So there's this explosive release of energy running or fighting, whatever it is afterwards, they'll often go into this shaking effect where they'll start trembling. I'm unconsciously or they can't control it.

Speaker 1:          01:33:52       It's like, and what they think is that it's like discharging all the excess energy and then they go back to homeostasis. And so his theory is that what happens with human beings is because we have these giant frontal lobes that we get shocks to our nervous system, um, and we can't discharge the energy. We can't fucking punch your boss in the face or we can't run or whatever. And just the same as when we were kids, we just swallow it up. We swallowed up and the, and that trapped energy, the nervous system starts to become our neurotic habits. It becomes chronic anxiety, becomes a panic attacks. It becomes chronic aggression or irritability. Also, chronic freeze responses get stuck in there too, which is sort of like chronic, not their illness or someone who sort a little bit dreamy. And so somatic experiencing is a whole way of working with it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:37       We're basically, it's sort of like exposure therapy, but it wouldn't, it's not, it's not the same. It's like it's all in the, uh, it's very meditative. It's like you're working with somebody and they, and they go, okay, why are you coming to the awardee feel comfortable sitting? It's like, oh, I, I feel a couple of sitting over here. Why did you sit there? Well, I kinda like had my back to the wall. Well, what is it about having your back to the wall that makes you feel more comfortable? I just feel this and it's like, well then what's the opposite? What's the discomfortable thing? And then you and you notice, well, what it would feel like to be uncomfortable there and you basically find a spot in your experience and your consciousness which is very centered and comfortable and then you find that the problem and you try to simultaneously notice both at the same time and basically all the trapped energy of the neurotic place starts to drain out that making sense.

Speaker 1:          01:35:21       I'm trying to make it visually vivid or visual, but that's how you work with this stuff. So you can start to drain out these patterns of like chronic fear. These paddocks of, of chronic fight. You do it, uh, by noticing how that pattern is in your body connecting to it. And then it can kinda empty out. It's so interesting because it also just, it, it blows the lid off trauma. It says trauma is going to be different for every person. All traumas is just shock to the nervous system. It's not just about surviving a terrorist attack or you know, all this horrible stuff. It's like someone might do something to Dan in the, in the smallest way when he's a two year old, that wasn't any big deal, but it completely freaked him out. It basically shocked his nervous system so intensely that now there's that pattern of shock that's in there that still lives in there.

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       And what happens? It just grows and grows and grows and because if you don't release that energy, it just just keeps causing havoc in the system. That's the thinking of somatic experiencing. It's. And I've been working with somebody and I had a. I mean, just to give him, to make it real. I had a, I've had a lot of injuries in my life, like broken neck and broke, busted shoulder and different things from just being a jackass. But one time I got hit by this truck, I was on my bike and it blew up my shoulder, hit the ground. And then uh, the, uh, back of the truck hit me and he has sent me spinning. Um, and so one time I was in there working with the somatic experiencing lady and she's like, what direction do you want to look in? I'm like, ah, I kind of felt like, look in this way if you don't, you don't feel like looking that way.

Speaker 1:          01:36:50       And I'm like, no, it doesn't really. I don't really want to turn my head this way. I don't really want it. And I realized that that's always there. I kinda don't want to look this way. And she's like, well, what, what happens when you look this way? And I, it was like, I started looking this way and was harder do and suddenly I remembered the impact of this truck from when I was 17 years old on this side of my body and I could feel that the impact was still in my body and she got me to work to turn my head. And like she got me to connect to that, to that. So I'm thinking of that memory and I'm feeling that memory in my body and she gets me to work through that turning my head and the act of doing that was like all of a sudden I felt all this new freedom in this pattern and I have now not had that issue as much. And that's just to give you an example of how you would work in that mode. Isn't that. Isn't that cool? I mean, I find that to unbelievably. I do too. That is interesting. Listening to your story about your life, about the lack of difficulty. It sort of reinforces my ideas about martial arts and that it's not about learning how to be a great fighter

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       learning on the beat people up. It's learning how to battle your own internal demons and, and confront insecurities and fears and to do it on a regular basis frees up a lot of the mental landscape. It allows you to just be more relaxed about a lot of different approaches to life and this, this tension and control that we have is a lot of time just pointless. And it's highlighted by martial arts training. Yeah, I think it's almost always pointless. Yeah. Although you know, the thing is you look at a good fighter, just like if you look at a good dancer, there's definitely a sense in which they're just flowing and they're responding, but then when they need to be tensed, boom, they got it. It's like they got that power behind them. It's like if you were dancing, for example, any. All you did was just flatty flow.

Speaker 4:          01:38:46       You would have, there'd be no form to it. It's like you need the pulling in, you need that. So it's about the. It's about the intelligent use of tension, you know, knowing when to be soft and then when to be having those two sides. Yeah, but what I'm talking about, those, the management of stressful physically difficult things on a regular basis frees the mind. Now just the, the, the, the getting comfortable with conflict and when in the absence of conflict, then you look to try to restrict and control everything and then every little affront to that, any little questioning and challenging of your control over things can cause anxiety because you're uncomfortable with this idea of surrender, of relax hoagland. Totally. Whether it's in psychedelics or whether it's meditation or all these things. There's some relationships. Yeah, and stand up comedy, communicating, podcast hosting. Good Morning America. I mean there's so many parallels because a lot of it is in managing the mind and just being able to, again, get out of your own way. I agree. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:51       Oh, we got that shit sorted out tomorrow. It'll pop up again in your cost while you got to keep doing it. It's like, Hey, these uses, these books are all saying the same thing again and again and again, but you still need to read it because you forget. Yeah. Yeah. And it gets a little bit easier all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:40:07       You know, managing the mind gets a little easier in part of it. You could chalk up to maturity and life experience, but it's also just this continual practice of paying attention to what's going on inside your head.

Speaker 3:          01:40:17       Exactly right. Jeff doesn't like my analogy that I'm about to use because he thinks it's slightly aggressive and he's right, but it's, it's mostly meant for comic effect, but it's like when you have a dog who takes a shit on the rug, you kinda. Sometimes you've got to put their snout and shit and that is what we're doing in meditation and in all of these practices. Seeing over and over again how crazy we are, how the fear arises, how the anger arises, how the discontent with whatever's happening right now arises and not getting owned by it. And, and that's why these practices so useful and why you got to stick with them. You don't get just fixed, you know, it doesn't work. That was nothing

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       like that. No. I mean, there are a lot of people

Speaker 3:          01:40:56       blood. They're selling them.

Speaker 1:          01:40:58       Yeah. Something real. What's the most annoying aspect of that to you guys? Please go to the power of positive thinking. Oh, well, you know, we were talking about that yesterday where people were talking about President Oprah and I reminded everyone about Oprah and the secret. I'm like, do you know how many fucking people ruin their lives because they thought all they had to do was have a vision board and think positive and this is going to be the key to happiness. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       I think it's. It's one of the most pernicious ideas that's ever been sort of released into our culture and it even predates the secret because there's. There's a book called the power of positive thinking. There's another book called think and grow rich. I don't want people to go buy these books because I don't think. See that the idea that you can solve all your problems through the power of positive thinking is so easily disproved. Just engaged in the following thought experiment. Anybody who's born right now in a refugee camp, were they thinking incorrectly in Utero in 2010 when the. When the earthquake hit Puerto Prince, Haiti, it was everybody in town thinking incorrectly. Did they bring that upon themselves? Of course not. Of course not, and yet we're telling all these people that if you make a good vision board, you can carry your cancer or you don't have to go to the doctor. All this. It is demonstrably false and recklessly dangerous

Speaker 1:          01:42:24       and most of the people that have had success with the power of positive thinking, they attributed to that, but you're not talking to any of the people that thought the exact same way and failed. You're only talking to the successful people. The the sampling is so biased.

Speaker 3:          01:42:41       The only people who've had all their problems solved through the power of positive thinking or the people writing those fucking books and selling all the copies and if by the way, if it was that easy, they're all new. One book.

Speaker 1:          01:42:51       Yeah, well, I would say writing books. I keep saying, come back to this next seminar in this freezing cold room with your credit card, but I will say the one part of it that they idea that you can have an intention that having a clear intention of something about how you want to be or something that you want to have happen, that that can be helpful. I think that's common sense, the difference between having a positive attitude. Yeah, absolutely beneficial. Yes. Absolutely. Do you guys have you heard, um, you know, William James, the great kind of psych psychologist, a mystic, he was a mystic. He had this really cool, um, he talked about, uh, I think it was called first born versus twice born or one sport once born and twice born. And it was a fundamental way in which you distinguished people who had, who have maybe had a spiritual outlook in life.

Speaker 1:          01:43:35       And he said the ones born people were. People were just naturally, they're the kind of the positive thinkers. The kind of like everything is perfect. Everything is awesome. This rose colored view of reality and really not able to kind of see suffering and everything, that kind of a thing, and we all Kinda know people like that. It kind of the classic, a naive spiritual person, uh, but he was really interested in the, what he called twice born and that's what he was. And I feel like that's, that's certainly how I identify which is somebody who can come into a kind of perspective, like a mystical or spiritual perspective but has to but only did it via having to look hard at the reality of suffering at the reality of evil, of fucked up shit in the world like that. You can't wave away the world's unfair distribution of wealth and hardship and that you had to come to that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       You had to come to your view through a honest reckoning with the crappy stuff about being a human being and the crappy stuff that's out there and that you couldn't not look at it and that you could do that. Like tolstoy was the famous example. Then you kind of could be reborn into a, a perspective that was wide enough to include the full bittersweet and that. And so I think that's what I think to the, to the, to the twice born, the first born outlook is kind of repellent because it seems like it's not looking at the truth of all the very real challenges that are going out there. It's like you could just be in, you'd go to your yoga class and heat your, your perfect raw food and be in your perfect bubble. But, but meanwhile the world is just contracted in pain. And to really be a kind of true, expansive humanist is to kind of look at all that and to still find your way into thinking that life is worth living. You know, there's a mystery there. And um, um,

Speaker 4:          01:45:18       yeah, I'm trying. I guess you have to recognize that there are these horrible things in the world, but concentrating on them fully in an only is not going to benefit you in form. That's also true. It's like there are amazing things to this life and the more you concentrate on them, the more you'll recognize them, the more you'll sort of baskin right? The amazing experience that we're all going through this right now, and so what you're describing as elements of positive thinking, that's the good side. That's totally legit. That positivity, positive attitude as opposed to positive thinking, which is loaded up with this idea of like sort of mental control of the external world and that I think is dangerous, but I think Joe's describing is gratitude. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. That's, that's so important. But it's important to parse this out. What part of this is healthy and good and what part of this is destructive?

Speaker 4:          01:46:12       Yes, I agree. Right, and what part of it you could parse out from what you would call the law of attraction, which is not a law, so I was not. I mean that's another part of the problem too. Like the Wu is written in the title like it's not a law, it's just that's not what it is. So you calling it the law of attraction, let's be know you're full of shit that was law made by Zeus. See that episode of Hercules. There's something that's undeniably important about positive thinking, having a positive attitude and being enthusiastic and having energy and focusing on the good and focusing your goals and focus on what you're trying to achieve, but the idea that that in and of itself is all you need, that that it's, it's uniquely powerful and then it can literally bring you your future and then all these people that say that, that this is what they used, like you know, you might have been successful and that might be your underlying thought process, but there is a wider series of factors. There's a big spectrum of things that had to happen for you to be successful, including luck, including the great fortune of being born in America and privilege. Yeah, there's so many different places. You could be so many different life experiences. You've could have had horrific parental situations in an household, situations you could have been born into. You're extremely lucky.

Speaker 3:          01:47:36       Look at the case of James Arthur Ray. I covered it extensively for ABC news that the, he was one of the gurus in the secret, in the DVD of the secret. He was one of the guys talking about how the universe is like Aladdin's lamp and he held a sweat lodge ceremony in Sedona, Arizona, which several people died and he went to prison. So how well was the law of attraction work for him?

Speaker 4:          01:47:57       Yeah, maybe it did work. He put in a bunch of bullshit and got some.

Speaker 3:          01:48:02       Yeah. They also found in his hotel room a lot of like a hgh and testosterone and stuff like that. So he definitely wasn't as buff just through the power of positive things

Speaker 4:          01:48:13       and he was trying to do what would the sweat lodge like, what was the. I like,

Speaker 3:          01:48:18       look, the sweat lodge is a beautiful ceremony from, for native Americans, people too hot or too hot and they overheated and their electrolyte balance got crazy or something and how to people dying or something like that. You know, it was awhile ago so I can't remember, but I think it was two people.

Speaker 4:          01:48:35       The problem with a lot of those people too is that what they do is they, they put together like some sort of a program where maybe it's a book, maybe it's a a guideline you're supposed to follow. Then they start teaching seminars in it and they start putting it into practice and leading all these people with this stuff and that it becomes who they are, like who they are is like a guru who they are as a spiritual person and people come to them that the dynamic they have people come to them, what should I do? And the universe provides bounty. Oh, and everybody claps and goes along with it and they live in this sort of bubble. Yeah. And it just, it gets really odd with those folks.

Speaker 3:          01:49:14       Yeah. I mean that was why. I mean I was, I had been assigned a years and years ago to cover faith and spirituality for ABC news even though I'm an agnostic and I ended up covering a lot of these new age gurus and that was why I ended up. My first book I wrote was called 10 percent happier because I was trying to counter program against the Sea of bullshit that is America is $11,000,000,000 a year self help industry because I was watching what this was doing to people's lives.

Speaker 4:          01:49:40       It's so far. We've been talking about that a lot lately. There's so many people that are trying to get in this on sort of the open level when you see it on Instagram, like there's a lot of people like promoting these inspirational little posts and they'll have these little inspirational videos like you know, what you got to do today is go out there and embrace life and just go after your goals and like. And there's so many people that are trying to give people this fuel and give people this and they might not necessarily really even be in practice with that themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:50:17       Yeah, it's A. I liked the open. I like your analogy about the open mic.

Speaker 4:          01:50:21       That is what it's like. It's like they're trying it out. They're learning how to be an Anthony Robbins.

Speaker 1:          01:50:26       Tony Robbins. It's funny. I have a friend who was living in France and they came back to Canada and he'd been in Paris, live in there for like 10 years or something and so he's walking around the streets of Toronto and he said it was the same when he was anywhere in North America and he kept feeling like there was something wrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it. It was like, what is wrong? Something wrong, and then he realized that everyone was actually having the same conversation all the time over and over again, which was everything's gonna be all right. Adam is going to be all right. Everyone's going to be all right. It was just this constant pepe cheerleading from everywhere. Whereas in France it's just like, things are fucked that is fucked. No, you are shit. And that's what it's like being in France know.

Speaker 1:          01:51:03       It's like at least they're honest, but that has its downsides, downside, but I mean there's also a realism where people are just gonna, like call it out as it is. We're here. There's such A. There's a tendency to just to Kinda. There can be this kind of Pollyanna ish. Everything is fine. Everything is fine because people don't really want to look at what's under, what's lurking underneath, you know, well, everything's fine right now in this moment, right? Most of the time. Now we've got pro most of the time in, but can we talk about the mystical mystery underbelly weirdness, show off this idea that everything is fine in the moment, this exact moment right now, like so in practice, this is something Shin Zen taught me that the more you. It's almost like the present moment is on a continuum and that didn't sound make any sense, but it's like you can be present and you need to be more present and more and more and you can start to get a feeling for that.

Speaker 1:          01:51:56       For practice of just the absolute. Now it's like you're getting closer and closer to the absolute now with ever actually getting there, which I know just sounds like a bunch of gobbly goop, but the feeling on the inside, it's just this. Everything is. It's like the silence, this presence. It's like this sacredness, you know, the no bullshit kind of sacredness that. What is that, you know, that to me is like I wrote about consciousness for a long time before I started realizing that there's this thing here and how do you talk about, how do you write about it in a way it doesn't sound ridiculous, you know, and yet it is the most important thing. It is the most, uh, it orients you to be able to come into that understanding. Yeah. How do we talk about it? You know, the mystics have always said you can't talk about it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:41       It's inevitable, but it's true as an experience. But where is it? Bears talked about intelligently, where are you going to read about that in the New Yorker magazine or, or whatever. You know, it's like, it's either talked about in this Disneyland way or it's not talked about at all. It's like we got to try to talk about, we got to try to, or at least remember not taco about come to find practices, you know, but honor that it's real and you know that that's something I'm really interested in and I'm trying to learn how to do it. Now. Let me ask you this. As an outsider, if someone is coming to this with zero meditation experience, no, no thought whatsoever about pursuing this and they're listening to you say these things like, okay, what's in it for me? What do I get out of that? What do I get?

Speaker 1:          01:53:23       If I can get to this, what do I get? What's what's in there? It seems like you're just alive. Yeah, like this doesn't seem like anything changes. Well, I think that is what you get. You get your life, you get your life back. Most of the time you're not in your life. You're freaking out about your life. You're in your head thinking about this, this or that happened, or you're responding to situations. What you get is the capacity to be sitting here in the middle of all this and be an appreciate the richness and the fullness of it because that's the thing. It has, it has a quality of a, of fulfillment in it, has a quality of like nothing needs to be any different. So there's a peacefulness and a beauty or something or even when things are objective, even when things are shitty and his bittersweetness so you know, this poignancy to things, it's like you get exactly your life, just more of it.

Speaker 1:          01:54:07       And that's why, you know, Shinzen used to say it's like, it's like you lived, it's like it, you get to live 10 times deeper or va one time to two times deeper or three times or four times the more you practice, it's like, it's the same surface, but it's the depth dimension that's getting like richer and fuller, broader. Um, and, and so then it gives you the capacity to also to appreciate more and more what's going on because most of the time we walk around like, ah, this is the stuff I like looking at. But I don't like this stuff over here, I don't want to feel these things are, I don't want to see these things. So we're like, we're kind of, you know, we're, it's like we live. The analogy I use is like, we're born into a mansion, but room by room we're like, nope, can't go in there.

Speaker 1:          01:54:46       Can't go in there. That's my ex girlfriend. Or that's my relationship with my parents. Or Oh, that's this limitation of this limitation. At some point we're just sitting there under the stairs. Everything is fine. I think it's fine. Yeah. I've really enjoyed my life. Were hiding in the dark under the stairs. Go. So you want to. It's about reclaiming the mansion, you know, it's like, can you be, like you said exactly, can you be free in more and more situations and can you begin to appreciate the, uh, the beauty of even these difficult situations and that way your whole life just kinda can open up to you. That's what the practice is about.

Speaker 3:          01:55:16       Other way of thinking about it and is, and this is a bit of a new age trope, so it's a little annoying. But it's like what I said before that cliches become cliches for a reason and the reason is their true generally all you get ever because right now, everything you've experienced in your whole life happened to you right now and everything you ever will experience will always happen to you right now. Non Negotiable. We live most of our lives. However, in a autopilot of in a fog of rumination and projection, and we're not paying any attention to the only thing we ever get. Meditation, digging more deeply into the present moment is giving you your life back

Speaker 4:          01:55:56       now. How do you address? Because what we're talking about is managing the mind and increasing happiness by 10 percent or more. Hopefully. How do you address psych meds? Because a lot of people that are going down this road have already gone down the pharmaceutical road and might be inextricably connected to it. Some sort of a way they might be on anti anxiety medication, be on antidepressants. Like how do you address that?

Speaker 3:          01:56:26       Jay? I think I can speak for both of us and that we are maximalists that when it comes to wellbeing, it's important. You got to surround the ball, you got to use every Arrow in the quiver, and uh, just because we're in the meditation doesn't mean we're not into all the other scientifically proven ways of dealing with your mental health. You know, I often say that we, as a culture, we spent so much time working on our bodies, on our stock portfolio is on our cars and no time on the one filter through which we experience everything and that's our minds. And so if you have clinically diagnosed anxiety or depression, which again, we need to be talking about more openly because there's so much stigma around it. I've dealt with both since I was a kid. If you have that, you should avail yourself of every possible remedy and if your doctor recommends a that you take psych meds, then you should investigate it. If it works for you, then stay on a meditation is just another thing you can also use along with exercise, getting enough sleep, having positive relationships, having a healthy diet. All the other no brainers with Jeff and I are saying is in the Pantheon of no brainers, meditation needs to be included.

Speaker 1:          01:57:38       Yeah. I think, I think with the meds thing, um, sometimes meds can get you to the baseline of uh, then then you can meditate, you know, and it's almost like a, I mean, I know too many people whose lives have been including people I know really, really well really, really helped by these meds. I know other people have had super hard time with it, but some of them at the same boat and some of them it's like, it gets you to a place where it's almost like the meds can help by time for your own system to work itself out. And so you get to a place where you're like, I have a lot of trouble with crazy energy surges up and down. Like, and like a manic phase. Yeah. Like I get, I get hypomanic and then I get like disparate and then hyper hypo manic.

Speaker 1:          01:58:18       I actually just got a diagnosis, uh, two weeks ago that I probably have a mild form of bipolar is 46 years old. I'm finally learning, but it's not a surprise. I kind of knew how do they, how do they diagnose that? So, uh, uh, so it was an interview, so it's an hour long. This case was like an hour and a half or an hour long interview or a guy just really took my history, like how I've been challenged. I have add big time add that's, that's been diagnosed multiple times but just because the way my attention works, but he basically really asked me lots of questions about how about my history and when things started to get into the more surges and, and they've been getting worse the past. And this is entering [inaudible]. I meditated a ton but, and, and there was a period of the meditation was super, super working really well and stabilizing everything.

Speaker 1:          01:59:04       And then there was a period where the meditation felt like it wasn't working as well and all this energy, it's like that trauma stuff I was talking about. All that stuff started to come up. So I go more into these ups and downs and I found that the practice would help. It would help me from feeding the spikes, but it wasn't I a, it hasn't been totally addressing it. Now. I haven't actually started any meds or done any lithium metal. I'm thinking maybe I would try that because I want to understand what folks go through. Um, but basically he just asks a lot of questions. There's, you know, I guess he, they have a diagnostic criteria around a set of like, does that seem to make sense for what we know about it and because they've seen all these patients, they've got all these ideas and it's so new.

Speaker 1:          01:59:42       I don't even know what to do with the information. In fact, I'm kind of can't believe I'm talking about it because it seems a bit premature, but I'm, you know, the way I think about it as I would consider doing meds because I just want to be able to get to a place where I could then let my body heal itself, help itself out, figure itself out, and the meds might buy me time to do that. Then they and the meditation can be part of that as well and that's just a messy human reality of it. But you, you seem like you've got your shit together. So like what is it exactly that's bothering you so much? You'd actually be considering medication? Well, it's try writing a book with them. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm like fine. Six days a week and then one day a week.

Speaker 1:          02:00:21       So there's the, there's the potential stuff. Just being overexcited about things in my getting pulled in every direction. That's not really a problem so much anymore. Like I've learned to the problems. There were more like you disappoint people, you feel like you can't get your shit together, you know, you're just, you're just so scattered that can happen and, and that back and upgrade its own challenges, but the energy ones are more fundamental. It's like, I'll wake up in the morning, you know, it might be once every week or two and all of a sudden I can feel my heart pounding and I could feel like this incredible energy in my hands and my body and I just, I'm in this hypo manic state and I, and I, and it feels good. I don't even realize it, but I'm going around, I'm talking, I'm excited about stuff and I'm just jacked up on this, like a, on this energy and it's um, and what comes up must go down.

Speaker 1:          02:01:07       So I usually like it. But then what will happen is I realized they know that I've been, I've exaggerated like, oh, I've gone into something that I had been too aggressive of a situation or have been exaggerating some situation where I got grind grandiose about something and I feel super embarrassed that I was in this sort of like high and in a way that. And I, and I didn't have my shit together at all. And then I ended up in the downswing, which is the, the catastrophizing, the like, uh, the despair sometimes. Like, you know, I said Lenny lose like that thing about being in the center that was talking about when it's there, it's so true and it's so there and all of a sudden I'm not there at all. I don't feel anything. There's, I feel like there's no meaning to anything and I am just in this desolation thing and that last for a few hours or like a day or something and then I'll pop out and I'm fine and I know that once a week or once every week, two weeks or something, I'm going to go into that cycle.

Speaker 1:          02:01:57       Now I've done my whole life without having. I've tried to manage it entirely with meditation, with exercise, with diet and I may just continue to keep doing that. Have you gotten better at it? I have got well so I have gotten better at managing it. Absolutely no question. I've gotten way better at not believing in it when I'm in a high and not believing when I'm in the down. I don't want to interrupt you, but the thought process, like what? When it kicks in, like what? What are you aware of it? So yeah, it starts as well. I am because I start this energy in the body, so I feel the vibrating this. I'm like, okay, that's the first my early warning sign and then it gets bigger and bigger, but the thing is it's addictive because you do you mind on your heart rate?

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       While this is how I know, but I can feel the fucking heart sometimes is going like a Jackhammer and other times the heart it cools out, but that it's like the. I mean the power is still there, the feeling of. And that's that feeling of power which is very workout when that hits. That's too. That is what I do. I hit a punching bag and it's the best. So I. This has been the best thing in the world for me is been hitting a punching bag and it's men meditation can't do shit when I'm in that place. Right. But punching bag, I feel calm and centered afterwards. So that is the main intervention of what I'm doing. I may never go the med route. I think I can handle it like I've been doing it until now, but what makes me want to do it is I want to know what other people have to deal with.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       Like I want to know what is like to be on those things and what and so I can help those people maximally and say, this is what I can tell you about what meditation can do and this is what I can tell you about what it can't do. This is what I can tell you about how physical practice can help, but how they might not be able to help. This is what I can say about how meds have helped and it, but if I can have good experience with those different things and talk to lots of other people who've done it, then I can triangulate it on helping people almost in a, in a more effective way. So when you get these surges, you get this energy surge, you exercise, you hit the bag, you feel great. Yeah. Does that even everything out? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:46       I usually take it can discharge the energy. Then why on earth would you be thinking about? Well, that seems insane because then as a very organic solution to this problem, but I don't know that it'll always will work with the punching bag. So it's working right now. Right? It hasn't perfectly worked every time. What's, what's. When you say it hasn't. Sometimes I go and I hit the bags and afterwards the energy's still in me. It may not have the same edge, but it's still. I can still feel it. And when you say energy is really interesting to someone who doesn't get the surges I want, I'm just trying to like, um. Do you feel like you're on caffeine? Do you feel like a speed speed? It feels like a nowhere. So you wake up and you're on speed. I'm on speed and it's like. And there's nothing I did externally.

Speaker 1:          02:04:29       Nothing happened. I didn't take anything. I didn't do anything all of a sudden. So this is the things. There are corresponding thought process that goes with this. Is there a zest for life is fucking. Life is awesome to me. It's, I want to go kick some ass. It's pure exuberance. That sounds great. It is great. But that's the problem of it. It's great. So you feed it so you're like, you want more of it, so you just, it's like. So basically it's like this. It's also not always great for the people around. It's not always great for the people around. You were like this, right? We have our ups and downs. This is like from foom foom and the more you feed the up, the higher you go, but that means that the bigger you have the fall. So like that's what I've learned is that when I, when I feed the grandiosity of the energy that exuberance, like I'm super fun to be with at parties for sure.

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       Like I'll do crazy shit. That's usually when I've had all my injuries, my various breaks because I've been on one of these crazy high. So that's another reason not to do it. But inevitably there's gonna be a part where it's going to crash. So. So now my whole job is from being a meditation teacher is I feel the energy start to come up and I back off. So it's like I let it just come through me, I try to let it just come up like a wave and just and I and I and it's really uncomfortable being in that vibrating energy and not acting on it, not saying some stupid shit or not like being more whatever, not acting on it and keeping it going. I have to kind of let it. So I just try to keep myself calm and centered and I try to let it just feed itself fruit now with the punching bag or with the biking and with these things that really can help with that process.

Speaker 1:          02:05:58       So I do think I might be on the verge of it. Maybe I won't do that, you know, maybe I won't, but I don't know because it's. The thing is dude, it's fucking hard being at tufts to anyone who is bipolar or be those ups and downs. It's hard to be in that. It's exhausting every week. It's like you don't, you wake up, you don't know who you're going to be this week. Who am I going to be today? Or what? Or if you're in a down place, like now you've made all these plans with somebody, then you got to cancel the plans, but you, you're talking, you were saying this is a slightly bipolar situation for you. This is so it's not. I think the bipolar, I'm not sure. One of them, there's bipolar one, bipolar two. One is more extreme like real mania where you go and fucking buy 50 couches and like, hey honey, I bought 50 couches.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       We're going to put couches all over the neighborhood. You know, like your classic Manic episode. It doesn't go for me. I never had that happen. I just have the, the Hypomania. So like the lots of the energy. But I don't go into total craziness. And biologically what is the process like? What is actually happening to you that's causing this? I don't know. Um, there's no, they don't understand that. I mean, so this is new for me. I'm just, I just found out two weeks. So I haven't really done the research on the brain science yet. They do say there's a brain signature just like there is for add, for bipolar, there's a particular signature of what, uh, of what it looks like. It has some kind of dampening of the frontal activity. So probably a lot of activation in maybe the Amygdala or something. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:07:22       Uh, all I know is from the inside, it really feels different. It feels like a, um, I mean it's, I mean, I'm sure people can relate. Like when you've had a coffee and you've got that vibrating energy or, or you have or feeling super confident about yourself, but it's almost like your confidence goes too far. You're a little bit like overconfident, you know, you're, you're delusional, delusional. It's a. and then that. And that actually happens in meditation to that stage, the upstage of meditation than to be called the arising and passing. You can get to a stage where suddenly you really feel like you get it. You. Oh yeah, I understand. It's like what Dan said. Yeah, they're gonna put a fucking plaque here on the wall. I'm the best meditator on the planet. Like because you got, you're just, you're just, all the energy is coming through you. And then inevitably there was the crash. So actually that is why I didn't get diagnosed for so long. I thought it was just meditation and that it was, I was just noticing the cycles because of my meditation and it was really just add. And it wasn't until it started just to become. I started to see, okay, there is a real pattern here. Like I need to just talk to somebody and get some other perspectives on this.

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       I just might make it worth. It's worth pointing out that it's highly unusual and very courageous for somebody in juxtaposition. It's, it's highly unusual for anybody to talk about having mental difficulties at all in our culture. Unfortunately, we need more people who are willing to say, you know, I deal with anxiety, depression, bipolar, um, add. But for somebody who's a meditation teacher to do it because as jeff has said that the traditional understanding of meditation teacher is someone who's got their shit together on every level. For somebody who's a meditation teacher to deal to come out and say, yeah, I have these challenges. He's incredibly brave and also really important because I think and, and, and working with Jeff on writing this book, one of the things you know, there were times when the patterns that he's describing were very annoying to me to deal with as his coauthor, but over time it actually, I, I started to see that he was wrestling with this stuff and in many ways it felt like a meditation teacher. It was obvious to me that he is a meditation teacher with Imposter Syndrome and now I think he gets in, I think you can hear it and what he's saying, that actually these challenges make them a better teacher. That he's more in touch with the things that we're all dealing with and sometimes on, on an exponentially higher level of degree of difficulty and that therefore he better at getting under the hood and helping other people with their mental challenge.

Speaker 1:          02:09:49       Yeah. Like so in many ways like what you were experiencing for your own profession is almost a gift. It's why I say, yeah, because you have this unique opportunity to explore your own consciousness in a very challenging way and also to be completely honest about it, which is very, very beneficial to not just your students, but a lot of the people that are listening to this right now, it's now, it's now it's living inside the snout because you get. It's more. It just makes everything more dramatic so you can see the dynamics because it's so frigging dramatic and you. You're then able to see the more subtle way it plays out for everyone because the stuff I'm talking about, it's just the human condition hand. Everyone's got [inaudible] is struggling with a version of this. It may not be to that extreme thing, but they but they got it or they have an orthogonal challenge over here.

Speaker 1:          02:10:35       It's something a little bit different, so you're. You're continually training your compassion for how hard it can be in life, but you're also learning very practically how to work with the dynamics of that stuff. Is the downside of that, the reaction to the upside or is there a corresponding physical feeling? I think of it as like a rope, like you're, you know, you got things like this, it's just physics will come. It's just what comes up must come down and mine is a bit unusual in that it's, I'm more up, I don't have a ton of. I don't stay down long. Sounds great. So that's why it took so long to get diagnosed. But then. But trust me that being up all is deranged too, you know, it's like you're, you know, I, I go back sometimes I had an experience where I just was trying to fix up my website, look back at an old talk I did and like that I was videos in this big room and I'm like, Holy Shit. I was so manic, you know, I just thought I was crazy because it's like, what the fuck was I doing about the memos you sent me when we're in the book? So say some credit. What was the, what was so crazy about the males? So, um, you know, I mean, do you want to explain it? Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:11:40       So we will be, this is a book we wrote is for beginners. I wanted it to be really simple and know we were doing it on a crazy deadline. So we did a road trip across the country in January 2017, so not long ago. And at the end of the road trip we, we recorded all of it. We got the transcripts back and we had to hand the book in in June. That set me up on a schedule where I had to write a chapter a week, which is insane because I have an anchor to shows at ABC and I have a wife and a child and it will be insane even if I didn't have that. And so my job was to write the narrative, the overarching structure of the book and Jeff was going to write the meditation instructions that got inserted in. And all I wanted from him was to give me some basic fucking meditation instructions.

Speaker 3:          02:12:26       I did not want an exit Jesus on, on like the pawnee shots, you know, like I didn't need him to go through and explain to me like the whole Pali Canon from Buddhism or the, you know, do his version of the Bhagavad Gita. But he would send me these memos with his grandiose, he'd be on a medic upswing, but he would have these ideas about how he was going to explain meditation as it's never been explained before as a series of exfoliation of the mind, blah, blah, blah. 17 page, 17 pages of life of like tightly, you know, because like you get the energy comes up and he gets super excited. Now I'm just pumped and want to talk about all these little kind of like a complicated bits and put it all together and create this really elaborate scaffolding and a metaphor to describe exactly how the mind works. And,

Speaker 1:          02:13:12       and that's why, you know, that's why I had, that's why I didn't get the book done before I was working on with Dan. I spent 10 years working on this book about enlightenment, about the, about the progress of insight and meditation. And I just kept getting more and more complicated and more because I kept. I would kind of simplify it and get. It'd be very sane. I have it all understood. And then I would suddenly go one of those episodes

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       and it would, I would explode it all and like elaborate whole new dimensions of stuff and it was like I would never get anything done, you know, and, and I want to say in your defense that the memo, because I've gone back and read the memos, they're great. It's just not what I needed while writing a very simple book on a deadline and I would get these memos, I look, I don't know what to do with this and, and so that actually you're putting your. So that is the reason why the ops are challenging because when you're in an up, you're not really seeing the world as it is. Like this is a person who needs a very particular thing. If you're just centered, you know that you respond with that, but you're in your own story about something and that is the part that's so pernicious or are dangerous about, about the ops and you know, and so that.

Speaker 3:          02:14:17       And that happened in the process. We're going to book, but then we got to sort it out. But yeah, of course, of course, I know there's something about, um, being on an upswing like that and in this kind of, for everybody, it's not just jeff and we're picking on Jeff here, but when we, any of us is on an upswing or any of us has just caught in any mental state. Your, your, your capacity for empathy and compassion goes way down because you're stuck in your own story. And uh, the name of the game here at the end of the day, not withstanding by already stated, misgivings about words like compassion. That is where the rubber hits the road because you can talk about performance that is important. But I think the real measuring stick for how well you've trained your mind is, are you an asshole?

Speaker 3:          02:15:04       Yeah, that's huge, right? Like, how well are you interacting with other people? That is the money. Do you care enough about other people to actually see who they are? Yes. To see the character in their face, the, you know, what, what they're really telling you. Can you actually get out of your. You just get out of your own bullshit and see what's going on in front of you. That's the name of the game. Right, and in the most awkward conversation did you ever have or when people were just talking at you? Exactly. Did Not even taking you into consideration. Yes. Why would you even talk to that person anyway? You're not. They're not. They're just talking to themselves, but you got to. For me, it's about what this journey is often about. Journey is another word that I don't really like, but what this exploration is all about.

Speaker 3:          02:15:43       Adventure, whatever you want to call it. As I see sometimes I'm that guy, I'm that guy. I'm not really listening, and you got to see that. You have to see that stuff in yourself instead of just complaining about it in others in order to really get to the, to the good stuff, which is actually then learning how to listen and it's also like we're talking about. It's very important for people to hear because everybody's that guy sometimes. Exactly. We may not want to admit it, and many of us liked to spend a lot of time complaining about how everybody else is a Schmuck, but you got to see that stuff. It gets back to the snout, man. You got to see that stuff, uh, because actually that's the good stuff. It's actually, there can be a real pleasure, truly a pleasure in seeing it. There's a great expression from this eminent spiritual teacher named Rom Dasa lives in Hawaii for your. Many of your listeners may have heard of him. He talks about how meditation doesn't conquer your neuroses. It makes you a connoisseur of your neuroses. You're like a Somali, a, of your own insanity. And there's a real pleasure every time you see a anger come up, uh, or your own selfishness come up. Oh, I see you. I see that there's a real pleasure in that because then in the scene you're then not owned, but you're not in it. You're not in it. That's playing the game well, and that's what this game is.

Speaker 4:          02:17:08       Now, for the uninitiated, all this is very hard to absorb. They're sitting back and listening this long conversation and trying to put all these pieces together.

Speaker 3:          02:17:20       What's the best first step to take actually try meditation is the is the best step to take and here's the thing to know. This doesn't require a ton of time. I often point out to people that have five to 10 minute a day habit is a great habit. I've spent. Everybody wants to know what's the least amount of meditation I can do and get the advertise benefits of meditation. All this stuff we've been talking about in high minded terms, but there are some easier to comprehend benefits from meditation, lower blood pressure, boosted immune system, literally rewiring key parts of the brain that has to do with focus and things like that. People want to know what's the least I can do to get that good stuff. I spent. We haven't cracked that by we. I mean the scientific community that studies meditation. I'm actually part of it, but uh, I know a lot of these men and women, they haven't figured out exactly what it is, what's the minimum dose, but I've asked them, you know, it's five to 10 minutes, probably enough in the general consensus is probably enough to derive many of these benefits.

Speaker 3:          02:18:18       But so that's the good news. But I think the even better news is if five to 10 minutes sounds like too much for you, one minute most days, one minute daily ish, is really enough to see what you need to see. What you need to see is that you're fucking crazy. You need to see it over and over again. This is the schnauzer getting his snout put in, in the poop. You need to have that happen to you over and over again. Why? Because every time you see that, every time you sit, try to focus on your breath. See that you've become distracted in that moment. That's the moment when most people think I've failed at meditation is actually the victory and when you see how crazy you are, when you've become distracted and learn how to start again and again and again. Every time you see that you've become distracted. That's a win and it when have really towering consequences because then you see that you don't have to be owned by all that craziness.

Speaker 4:          02:19:12       You can recognize it. You could nip it in its tracks. Another thing that I think that people should take into consideration about this talk of this meditation and trying to manage the mind is that one of the big issues and struggles that we faced with today is addiction to social media. It's a giant and it is the exact opposite of meditation. It is this constant like clicking and being distracted and just getting all this weird input from stuff and it's not. I enjoy social media on occasion, but you got to recognize that this is something that can overwhelm your consciousness

Speaker 3:          02:19:49       and I'm not going to present myself as holier than thou and this because I to enjoy it and sometimes I take it too far. There's no question about it. I'll get lost in social media where meditation is useful is because again, what your training is self awareness. You're just training to see your own stuff clearly so that it doesn't own you met in the course of meditation it because if you have some meditation under the belt when you're so deep in a twitter whole that you're, uh, you know, spent three hours on the thing. Maybe meditation can kick in at some point and say, oh, my stomach is bubbling, my head is aching. I haven't eaten. I'm not ignoring my children. And you can pull yourself out of the spiral and you just get better and better at doing that. I don't think perfection is on offer.

Speaker 3:          02:20:32       I don't know that all of us are gonna live like Shin Zen young, where the university is just bubbling up through us all the time. When we're not enemies, I'm editing for 50 years. Okay, so great. That's nice to have those aspirational figures out there. It's also great to have masters out there who can get in and help us with our meditation practice for most of us at a level of five to 10 minutes a day or one minute a day or one minute. Most days. It's just that you're going to become marginally less of a schmuck and that's really valuable and it does not have to be complicated. Sit down for five minutes. Do it for 10 minutes. Notice your breath. Then we get distracted to come back. Notice what got you distracted. That's it. You do that. You'll find your own way into these insights.

Speaker 3:          02:21:12       You know you will start to learn how it works and this is take the time to do that and you don't even have to do it in a sitting practice. You could do it, you know when you're exercising or something. It's just harder to do it when there's more going on. I mean normally we lead with that, but since you're a beautiful Weirdo, you took us into all sorts of. Weird spaces and that's where we went first and Jeff is in my view, one of the best people in the world at talking about meditation at the deep end, but normally we lead with what we just discussed, but you know, such is life.

Speaker 4:          02:21:43       Well, I think that this is an important aspect of it to focus on that social media use and this addiction that we have is literally the exact opposite of this mindfulness and meditation and really concentrating on being completely free of all these, these devices and things that you're distracting yourself.

Speaker 3:          02:22:05       Thing to think. It's like living is making habits. What habits are reinforcing you are what you repeatedly do you. So if you are just completely. If you're training your attention to be fragmented, it's gonna only get more fragmented because of the things just keep changing. They get deeper and deeper and deeper. So at some point you need to start training a different set

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       of circuits. You know, it's just about that. It's about what you're going to train and what you're not going to train. Most of us don't think of life that way. We land in life and you just start doing stuff, but the things you're doing are the things that are going to become your inevitable conditioning and that's a very sobering thought, but it's also liberating thought because it shows you that if you can start to do the stuff that's better for you, better for your brain, your body, then you can start to reverse that stuff as well. Right.

Speaker 3:          02:22:51       Amen. To what you just hadn't. Just to amplify your point about this, the mindless use of social media being the opposite of meditation. I actually think there's. It's interesting. I think the proliferation of communication technology is in part why meditation has become so in vogue because people know on some level whether they can, whether they can articulate it or not, it's something's wrong. We are. This is really interesting woman minutia Zomorodi who has a podcast called note to self and it's about all about our relationship with technology and I was talking to her recently. She said, we're conducting this massive science experiment with these devices and we don't know what the outcome's going to be, but it's happening globally and people have a sense that something's off. And that I think is why meditation has become such a. But you know, actually I think what I think is really interesting is if you guys heard of the slow technology movement, um,

Speaker 1:          02:23:46       there's a few different ideas around this slow design or the basic idea is that right now the interfaces that we use, these flat screens, these, uh, and all the notifications, the buzzing, the flickers that's kind of blowing our attention apart, but that it's true. So it's training the brain and the mind and a particular kind of way. But in the exact same spirit, if you were to start to design these interfaces in a way that according to basic mental health principles, you might be able to create a more positive habits. So it's just starting to think like actually how could we design our to our devices? Our interfaces are technology in a way that's promoting a more happiness, more connection, more of all the good stuff. And that's a good question. People are just starting to ask and I think it's really, really cool to like think, think about things in that way that it's. It could be an opportunity, there could be an opportunity with these with the technologies to do something really awesome. So it's not like it's, it's because they're neutral in a way. It's just a tool. It's how you use it. The

Speaker 3:          02:24:45       tool and the way in which the tools designed for allegation is that actually many of these devices and platforms have been designed specifically to me, but that's not neutral. They're like they're salty potato chips. You can't stop eating. Yeah, I'm a but I will just put in one plug. But while we're waiting for slow technology to come to fruition, there are ways that it's on us as users to use these things wisely. One thing I would say is as somebody who does use twitter and instagram is a, there's a great tweet from this guy, Ian Bremmer who, who's a big thinker about current affairs. His. I think his pin tweet is something like a. If you're only following people you agree with, you're doing it wrong and I think there's a way in which actually are social media use in, in, in that we create these cocoons bubbles, ideological echo chambers were only following people who give us visceral, satisfying, ideological red meat.

Speaker 3:          02:25:44       If in fact you can use these platforms and podcasts to listen to people with whom you disagree and maybe you communicate with them. Then actually that is a thoughtful and wise use of this technology and may solve some. What I would argue is the biggest problem this country is facing right now, which is toxic, tribalism. Toxic tribalism is a really good way of putting it. That's like your. Everyone's just stuck in their own facebook feeds. It's basically the facebook feed is your reality. Yeah, but you can use facebook to connect with your neighbors, you know, disagree with you, and to actually be able to hear their arguments in a way that isn't blindly reactive. It's about doing the rounds of the community. Can you actually go out there and do the rounds of the video and check out some different perspectives? Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          02:26:33       I think that's very important. I do that a lot. I, I, I, I follow a lot of people that don't agree with and I also try to talk to a lot of people that don't agree with. I think that's also important to and to have some sort of common ground where you can explore the ideas themselves and not look at the person who presents the ideas as your enemy. That's a real problem today in this country. Obviously. I agree. We've never been more divided in terms of right left and the ideologies and especially when you have such a divisive president. I mean you have this, this person at the very top of the heap who literally chastises people and mocks them on twitter. I mean you have a, a mocking insulting president. It's fucked up. Who uses social media and there's a trickle down from that. Unquestionably. There's people that look to the guy who was at the top of the food chain as being the one who we should model ourselves after in some way, shape or form. And so the idea that people are leaning in that direction now where they weren't for eight years, it's weird. It's a weird time for interaction and debating ideas.

Speaker 3:          02:27:40       Yeah. Well, it's also, again, one of the negative things with social media is that thing of just like the whole trolling thing, you could just say whatever you want because you don't actually have a real human being right in front. You can't see them. They're hurting either hurt. So people are just this unbridled reactivity that just creates more activities into my own twitter feed snowballs and people saying things to me that they. I doubt they would ever say to my face, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:28:02       yeah. I mean that's what we do. That's what people do. And that's one of the things that's so bizarre about the lack of social cues. You're not standing in front of someone. There's no consequences. It's, it's communication in incredibly unnatural and unrealistic way. All our lives. The time that we were monkeys coming out of trees are in exchanges, have been face to face until very recently. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:28:29       And again, I know we're flogging the meditation thing and I don't want to present it as a panacea because it's not and nor is it the only approach to increasing the sanity quotion in our society, which badly needs to happen, but again, I do think that meditation, mindfulness, that sort of self awareness that's generated through meditation can play a positive role in this, the aforementioned toxic tribalism because if you're so caught up in your own story, you can't, as we've discussed, have the kind of empathy that is needed to understand people who have different views and meditation is a way among other techniques to kind of just reduce how seriously, how personally you're taking your own inner chaos. And I think that can be very useful right now. Do I think everybody in the world's are automatically gonna hurl themselves into the Lotus position? No, but I think each individual can take a personal responsibility for making things less crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:29:26       I agree with you 100 percent. I think that's a good way to wrap this up. Yeah. Well good. Thank you very much. Thank [inaudible] else. You know, any. Anything else to add before we wrap this?

Speaker 3:          02:29:35       Thank you for putting me in the tank. I really appreciate that. There's an expression of gratitude is the expectation of future favors, so

Speaker 2:          02:29:42       I expect to be back in that tank anytime you let me know when you're in town. We'll hook it up and by the way, there's hundreds of tank centers all over the country. I know. I'm sure you're in New York, right? So they. I'm sure they have them. I know they have them in New York. They have them all over California now, so they're everywhere. All of the states. So find them. Thank you guys for the book to people. The title meditation for Fidgety skeptics. There you go. That's it. Bye everybody.

Speaker 6:          02:30:10       Three hours.

Speaker 2:          02:30:23       Mm.
