Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey everybody, what's up? This episode of the showings parents podcast is brought to you by stamps.com. You've probably heard, but the cost of a stamp just went up to forty nine cents and by the way, if you're complaining about a stamp being forty nine cents, you're a Douche bag. It's only forty nine cents. Imagine if I had to give you money to take a fucking letter across the country. I think you'd want more than forty nine cents. It's an awesome bargain, but let's be honest. Go into the post office. Sucks the fat Dick. We all know what does.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       It's slow. It's slow. It's not efficient, it's boring. It's fucking boring. My mom sent me a letter that had the wrong postage on it and it went all the way to Burbank and then the burbank post office. It's like, Hey, this doesn't have enough postage on it and send it back. Oh Jill, genius. Fucking brilliant.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       The real issue is if you have a small business, if you have a small business, if you send things through the mail, that's a place where a service like stamps.com is invaluable because with stamps.com does is it allows you to print us postage on a regular home computer, regular printer, just print it out, stick it on packages, mailman comes, hand it to him, done.

It's really a beautiful way to save a lot of time, especially if you send things on a regular basis, especially if they're varying weights.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Oh my goodness. That is annoying. You know, it's annoying and I know it's annoying. This is an easy way to work around that.

Jerry were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com. That's o n I t o n n let me say it again on it, o n n I t if you've heard this podcast, he probably heard noncommercial and there's way for me to do them any other way. This is, this is what it is, what we sell it on. It is everything that I use, everything that arbor uses, everything that we find out about that is beneficial to either physical fitness, beneficial to cognitive function, healthy snacks like hemp, hemp force protein bars or Tonka, buffalo bars which are made the old school way, the same way, uh, of the native Americans used to make them.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       So actually buffaloes and cranberries and shit. They're delicious. And it's not bad for you man. It's a, it's actually an interesting t to eat. No MSG, no soy, no lactose, which has tried to sell cool shit. Hemp force protein powder. Um, whether it's um, cognitive enhancement supplements like Alpha brain or new mood, which by the way, Alpha brain, we released the results of the first clinical trial. Very positive, especially in two areas and execution and memory and all the results are available online. You could find them on the Alpha brain page and we're in the middle of a much larger study. Now. That study was actually a, um, what they call it, pilot study. They do a study of say like 16 to 20. Well I guess it was 20 people initially and I think it got down to 17 or 16 and what happens is some people just quit, you know, people are fucking flaky, but the pilot study is to make sure that the protocol is a adequate, you know, we decided to go with a two pills per person.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       I take four before I do things, but I'm a fucking maniac folks. That's just what I do. I'm crazy like that. And on a one 80 actually has alpha brain in it, a little bit of new mood as well. Some five htp and on a one 80 is fantastic for me. For anytime I fly somewhere I just immediately take that upon landing. Anytime I feel like I have jetlag, anytime I'm boozing it up, which I, I really don't do anymore. I gave out boozing it up with me. I still get high, but uh, I just, I just don't. The rec afterwards just sucks so hard, man. I've been doing the same thing. Yeah. Uh, I try to limit it to two drinks. If I go out a lot of times I don't even have the desire to have more than one because why do that?

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       When you can do other things that are better and don't give you a hangover? Exactly. The other night I had to and it was crazy. I had a glass of wine with dinner and then I was out with some friends and I had a jack and coke. I was nuts. It was a very mild jack and coke though a point being the, the issues that you deal with when you are hung over. There's a bunch, there's dehydration, but there's also a depletion depletion of all the beautiful things that make your mind rich and interesting. Like Serotonin, you know, you fucked up from alcohol man, and you get fucked up from the lack of sleep. You don't get good sleep when you'd go to bed drunk. I mean you're just a mess. All the ingredients in Alpha brain and all the ingredients in one a or any of the other supplements that we have are available at [inaudible] dot com, along with all of the scientific research and references that point to individual

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       studies about individual ingredients and the most recent study on Alpha brain, which is the study on the actual combination of the ingredients to achieve a synergistic effect. There's a lot of science behind it, but there's also a lot of controversy. So to alleviate some of the concern at Onnit, we offer a 90 day 30 pill, 100 percent money back guarantee. So if you buy a bottle of Alpha brain 30 pills, you have 90 days to tell us it's bullshit. And if you don't like it, I look, I have no idea how your brain works. Uh, I know for me it's not just beneficial, it's essential. I love the shit. I feel nervous if I do a UFC without it. I really do. I. I think that it helps me form sentences better as I form a shitty sentence. It helps me when I'm searching for words, I get them easier and I know that sounds weird, but go on at.com. O n n I t used the Codeword Rogan save 10 percent off any and all supplemental. Alright. Boom. Cello clock. Boom. David Seaman is here and we're fixing a busy. We've got a lot of shit to talk about. Hitting the bitcoin fan.

Speaker 2:          00:07:00       It is. Shit's crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:07:02       Fair.

Speaker 3:          00:07:05       The Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       Joe Rogan podcasts all day.

Speaker 3:          00:07:13       Fitting that our friend David Seaman is here the very day that Mt. Gox the big storage place or whatever the fuck it is. This site, the,

Speaker 2:          00:07:24       it's an online exchange for bitcoin. The exchange is diggity. Diggity done. Yeah. So it hit the wall. I'm like the forrest gump kind of random trends. Like I'm always kind of in the background of all this completely unrelated shit and yeah, Mt. Gox was run by this guy who is a, uh, allegedly kind of a, a piece of shit I got to say like allegedly is you guys do. But as a respectable journalists, I've heard sources say he's a piece of shit. And uh, so there is an error in the way that his site interacts with the overall bitcoin network and the same way that if you, you know, are using email and you happen to download a shitty email program, like a knockoff version of outlook and it fucks up the way you send your emails. It doesn't mean there's a problem with email. There's a problem with what you're using and the way you've implemented it.

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       And email has been used enough by now that we know that it works. And it was kind of a similar issue here where there was an incompetent implementation and some hackers were able to steal over time, somewhere between $300, million to $400,000,000 worth of bitcoin. So it's pretty brutal. And bitcoins taking a bashing in the press, which is well deserved. But uh, I personally bought more or less night because I've just been reading about it so much that I actually kind of believe it and I'm drinking the Koolaid and in that case when some shit like that happens, it's not a tragedy, it's actually kind of an opportunity because I'm like, well now I can actually buy some more this instead of only having a little bit of the future currency of the new world order, I'll have a real fraction of it and I'm already getting shit from people who are like, you're promoting a product that is new world order designed. And I'm like, do you have any evidence of that? Like have you actually read even a 10th as much of the people who were reporting on this shit? Like everything is out there about bitcoin and yet they're already moving towards. It was created by two.

Speaker 1:          00:09:13       I think that's sort of what we were talking about before the podcast started, that there's a bunch of people that love for something to be a conspiracy. So they look for it and everything in anything, things that are. I've been involved in things where I know there was no conspiracy. I know I was there and yet I've had people tell me that it was like ufc fights, like the things are fixed, that someone wasn't really injured and that they're just. It's a big scam and all it is is to set up another fight. They had this all along shuffle. It's like people love to think, well, it's because there are some conspiracies, so they go looking for him because they don't want to be a fool. Right? Nobody wants to be fooled by them and that that is the number one problem with the fact that conspiracies have actually existed. They've muddied the water so badly. It's sort of like a disinflation tactic. It's like one of the things that I always talk about, like if you read anything about intelligence and you read that not not intelligence, like human intelligence, but intelligence reporting for the government. One of the things they do when they're trying to control information is they discredited by attaching it to ridiculous shit. It's just what they do.

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       Yeah. It's actually like a an actual strategies you mix in the bullshit with the good stuff poisons the well and you don't believe any of it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Yeah. It's like if you believe in something absolutely ridiculous for long with some really interesting shit, they can automatically point to that ridiculous thing and say, let's say same guy believes that people are reading your mind from a base on the moon and then he goes, that true. Does he really believe that? Well, then you find out what's really going on. You find out that all this other stuff, like if you ever read Bill Cooper, no course, I've heard of that book for some reason, but you will. You read it and you go, wow, this stuff's really fascinating. And then he starts talking about alien bases on the moon and you're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Yeah, started talking like that actress Shirley Mcclain has a book, has a book that I was skimming through. That's all about like how in the 19 fifties the US government had a secret meeting with like seven different species of alien and there was this council and even though she's a good actress, you reading this shit and you're like, I can't believe anything you're saying now because this is a little out there. She's awake. He wacky, broad. Have you ever heard her talk about look, sidekicks and all kinds of other shit? No, I'm just skimming this book and it was enough. She's alone. She's a full on loan, but what? But she could totally be right. I want to add that and also I want to believe she's right about the alien council. She's asleep. Silly

Speaker 1:          00:11:39       person. I mean you could, you could Google shirleen mcclain and find out all the different spiritual healing energy things she's into and yeah, she's. She's just an erotic massage probably. She's The lady that you know, like there's a thing that to humans,

Speaker 5:          00:11:53       and it's the same thing. It happens to men and it happens for women when they stopped being desirable physically. They often look to fantastical and unimaginable things like Ufo shows or fucking spiritual awakenings and psyche. They look for something that drags them out of the mundane existence of biology because if the UFO was real, if aliens were real, if big foot was real, if you could really read people's minds, it wouldn't matter if no one wanted to fuck you anymore. Yeah. There's something that's bigger than yourself. So this is a reason why like menopausal women, like older women get really into that kind of shit. Like if you look at like, and I'm not saying that young women don't get into it too. They certainly do. I would. Men, there are a lot of men, a lot of men who are in the weird shit.

Speaker 5:          00:12:41       Fuck yeah. I mean this is just one theory, but there's, there's a spiritual thing that happens to a to a lot of older men and older women where they, they start looking for like, you know, paranormal things to start looking for. Well, they're starting to feel more spiritual because they're getting toward that point in life where you got to think about that shit. This is a little of that definitely, but in the search for things and search for things unseen, like the search for big or search for aliens, I really do believe that a lot of what's going on as if aliens were real. It wouldn't matter if no one wanted to fuck them and they're sleeping on a friend's couch and they're 50. It really wouldn't matter. You know? You guys don't know shit. Let me tell you something, but what the aliens they would get if they just had a weed Brownie or maybe like a weekend camping or something, is that it already doesn't matter.

Speaker 5:          00:13:28       They don't need to find that other thing to make their life seem like it's not a big deal. Just look up in the sky. Sometimes nothing matters with certainty. There is some crazy article in scientific American that if you were to add up all the people who've ever lived on earth, it's like a $100 billion people. Yeah, so you just don't matter. Period. Like where were these fucking things that are running around trying to spread our, our genetic code and then our hearts filled with cholesterol and we die. It's like some weird video game and so somebody like that feels that they need to find religion or they need to find aliens in order to feel like they're a part of things. They're already a part of things so they already don't matter. So what more do you need? It's like, that's perfect right there.

Speaker 5:          00:14:10       I don't even think it's a don't matter thing. I think they're looking for something exciting for a lot of people. I mean obviously it's just one of these goofy theories I'm chasing down, but for a lot of people when it comes to what matters in life, one of the big things that matters in life is being sexually desirable. And when you stopped being sexually desirable, like unequivocably no argument, no one wants to fuck you. Right? And it happens sooner to women than it does men. Because for a man you're like 18 or 20. Nobody wants to fuck you because you have nothing going on. Start to get into your mid twenties. If you're good looking, you might be able to get something based on that, but as you get older you get more status and more experience. You know what the fuck you're talking about more often. That's where attraction comes from,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       but for women it's like twenties. You're fucking prime right there. You're already at the Max and the 25 is still good. Still good, but as you get older, as society is not just heaping you a heaping status upon you, right? It's still for you very much looks based. Whereas an older guy, nobody cares what Richard Branson looks like or what Felix Dennis looked like. It's more about who they are, but if some actresses in a show and she looks old, everybody will say that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Yeah, there's definitely something in that, but I think like Richard Branson, if he's got a really young hot wife and that wife has got a personal trainer, she's going to let him fuck her.

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       You think so? I think so. I think that guy would think that. I think that trainer would end up on an unsuccessful space flight. Never come back. I mean, I don't think it's going to fuck her all the time unless he's stupid,

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       you know, you gotta make sure you don't turn into a relationship. But I think a lot of gold diggers, they looked to fuck young guys for sure. Some young studly broke bodybuilder type dude with a giant hug because that's what they really want

Speaker 2:          00:15:55       the end of the day. They want the status, but they also want something physical. Oh, women just want the money into sex and that's all men want. Also, you know, when I was young, when I was a

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       again my, uh, my late teens and early twenties, it was the most undesirable I've ever been in my life. Like I had the hardest time getting laid the hardest because I was broke, I was poor and I was, you know, it didn't even matter if I was successful in some things like sports, which I was, it didn't matter because what was important was money was important, was financial success was important with you not being a loser. And I was a loser as far as like bank accounts and as far as where I lived, I was a loser and I was a young man. And every young man's, unless you're born rich, you're starting out as a loser, you don't have anything to show. And women had no desire to be with me.

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       Zero. There are guys who really kind of get off on being able to bring women back and have nothing going on. We like, look at what a loser I am and I'm still getting laid. So that kind of thing. You can use that to your advantage probably. That's what I do. When I was at colleges, I was like, yeah, I'm a loser, but if this is what I can pull now think about 10 years from now when you're actually not a loser, how good things might be, you know. So that's a way to motivate yourself. Well, it also depends on what you're willing to fuck to. I mean, everybody can get laid if you drop your standards lower enough. Women have the advantage in that area because they can always get high quality sex. Whereas a guy like you really can't unless you're at a certain stage in life, you can't just walk in somewhere and go home with somebody that night, but a woman can do that anywhere. But the balance is that that's not what most women want, right? They want different things, relationships,

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       they want, you know, I think most women, by the way, this is just massive generalizations. There's, there's some women that just want to fuck you and kick you right out the door, get out, go by, don't kiss me by. I mean, you know, and that's fine too. The, uh, the differences, that guy laughs as he's getting out. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       You know? Whereas if you do that to a girl, like you're the worst piece of shit ever. If you fucked a girl and then after you die, like, look, you got to go. Don't kiss me. Go. No, no, no, no hugs. Yeah, it's a real, like a sociopath kind of thing to do. Right? But if a girl does it to a guy, guy will go tell his friends, dude, she suck my Dick. I fucked her. Debbage kicked me out. She had to go to work. She came out, she told me, don't kiss her. Listen, this isn't going anywhere and get out. I was like, okay, I'll call you if you want to fuck again. Okay, please do. Thanks. Yeah. I think everybody's had that experience where you're like, I was just used and you're like, wait a second. So that's a bad. Was awesome. Totally different.

Speaker 5:          00:18:25       But I think it's totally different because women have a different instinct for the most part, in a massive generalization, by the way women have the instinct to try to find a guy that they can trust, try to, you know, spend unless you're done, unless you've been through a few and you're like, well, it's over. It's what the Cougar thing is. So people like about cougars, the fucking given up. I just like women who have their shit together and cougars tend to be more professional, like executive types. [inaudible], I no longer go for the starving artist because I always like to be the less crazy person in the relationship and if I'm the one that they're relying on for some kind of stability and unlike already completely fucking crazy with the stuff I'm working on, that's not a good thing. You know, like when somebody is asking me for quarters to use the laundry machine, it's not a good relationship.

Speaker 5:          00:19:12       So I'm more into the stability. Yeah, it's hard, man. It's hard when when you're dating, you know, in water, the other is really financially unstable. It's, it's always hard because it's very stressful, you know, and it, it, it puts a giant wedge in the relationship. I have a friend, she's successful and her boyfriend now, ex boyfriend is. I'm not very successful and one of the things that they fight about is that like he's just frustrated all the time. He can't get anything going with his career. You actually, it's funny that something just happened for them. Right. As you know, they broke up. That always seems to happen. There's like a, sometimes a Murphy's law going on there maybe, but it's just, you know, we were talking about it and she was talking about how difficult it is to date someone who's really struggling because it becomes a, it's a mantra.

Speaker 5:          00:20:03       It's like going off in the back of the head at all times. Like you're broke, you owe money, your bills. Oh yeah. When you have money problems, that's all you think about. Collectors are calling you, you're gonna, you're gonna. Get your car repossessed, you need another job, you need this, you know, and that it's just, it's really hard to date someone like that because you don't get them. You get them under massive duress. Right? No. Yeah. It's definitely better if you can walk into something where you have a bit of money because when you have money, it's the opposite feeling in your head, oh, this could go away if I wanted it to. Whatever the problem is. Like this could probably be reduced if I need it to. Well, there's that for sure, but this is the. The big thing that I noticed when I got my first development deal wasn't a lot of money, but it was enough money to where I could

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       relax. Like I wasn't getting rich, but it was like, Holy Shit, I've got some money, like I can really. I don't have to worry about paying my bills. I can pay my rent this month. There was this crazy weight lifted off my shoulder and I think I was 25 at the time and you know, most of my life up until that point, from the time I was working, it was all struggles. Never. There's no money in the bank. The money was in the bank. It was enough to pay whatever check I sent out maybe, and then I was going to have to stuff some more money in there as quick as possible to pay for the next bill's, but all the sudden I had some money in the bank and there was this weird feeling of relaxation. I was like, wow, this is incredible. Not Rich. Just not having to worry.

Speaker 3:          00:21:28       So whenever I give people, you know, if I talked to someone who's struggling or talk, someone's trying to plan the future, I always say, and this is, it's hard to believe, but it is the truth. Being rich doesn't matter. You get used to everything you're doing. You get used to being in a big house. I've been in a small apartment. It felt exactly the same as being in a big house. Being in the big house is kind of cool, but it's definitely not. It's not worth what it costs to be in a big house. If you think like if you buy a house for a million bucks, the amount of money you have to spend every fucking month on a million dollar house and mortgage and fixing it up and amount of hours that you have to work. If you're, you know, you work a reasonable job, you make 100 grand a year or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       Normal good wage. It's a lot of fucking money, man. You, your house cost 10 times what you make in a year and you're never going to pay it off in a year. You're going to pay it off in 30 years and then you're going to have to fucking pay insurance on the fucking property tax. What do you mean property tax? I got to pay tax on some shit I already bought every year, right? Even I already own it. I own the fucking house. I own the property and I have to pay you. What am I paying you for? I'm giving you money for what I own. What the fuck is going on here? And it'll drive you crazy and plumbing and electricity and this and that. When you really stop and think about how much you're actually working for what you're getting out of it, it's definitely not worth it for most people, but what is worth it is to not worry about going to dinner.

Speaker 3:          00:22:54       If you can have enough money where I can go and get a meal at a restaurant and not think too much about it, just say I would like the salmon and not look at the price and say the chickens this much, but the salmon's you know, a dollar less. I'll get the salmon instead of thinking like that. You can just order what you like. You could go to a movie and not worry about the movie. All the other shit like the difference between having a lexis and having a Mercedes. The difference between having a a Toyota and having a Ford, you get used to everything. Everything you're doing, you get used to, as long as your car gets you to work, it's fine. If you have enough money to buy a Mustang, hey, you love mustangs. Go get a fucking Mustang, man. Enjoy yourself. But if you don't, don't sweat it. Do you have a car that gets you there? That's the real difference between your car being repossessed. You have no money for food, you have no money for rent and being able to pay your bills. That's

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       the big jump. The big jumps not for robberies and you get used to that. Still look at Steve Jobs. He never went crazy and he was worth billions. There's always the fucking turtleneck everyday, but he did go crazy. He went crazy to like to push success. He went. He never. He didn't have a balanced perspective. No, but I mean in terms of he wasn't buying a mansions and cars and stuff nonstop. No, but he was so obsessed with the pursuit of, you know, apple being this dominant market player and all the money that they made and yeah, he went a little crazy just in his own way. You know, there's a minimalist crazy to where he still lived in like the fucking silicon valley where I have a friend who lives up there. They have a house that they're renting, but the house was worth $50, million dollars.

Speaker 5:          00:24:27       I want to tell you if that house was in a fucking van eyes, it wouldn't be worth 400 grand. I was looking, I was looking at a, just a real estate website is San Francisco. There was a place for sale. Those 200,000. It looked like one of the shacks in Detroit. Just objective like a $10,000 property. You're going for $200,000. Oh, no doubt. If you could put another house in there, eat. If you could jam it in there with no backyard. Just fucking stuffing on the actual footprint. That areas where so much money, when I say that it wouldn't be worth 400 grand event. I'm probably exaggerating. I would say it's probably worth a million and van eyes. It's a very nice house, but my point is it's not a fucking 14, $15,000,000 house or whatever the fuck they would actually wind up getting for it. It's just not, but it's in this crazy area where all these people have tech money and that tech money, squirrely money, man.

Speaker 5:          00:25:16       It just. The, the, the numbers are crazy. It doesn't make any sense to find out how much money. Some of those guys. I mean like the Google guys, the facebook guys and you're like, what? Like that's crazy. That's many yachts, private jet Manchin, buy an island money. It's that insane. What's going to get even crazier in the years ahead with bitcoin because some of the earliest adopters, the amount of coins they have, you think about it, you're like, well, these people are for sure going to be billionaires and they're going to be at the upper end of that. They're not even going to be like low level billionaires. Right? But what would happen if they collected, if they sold all their bitcoins? Oh you can't, you can't sell them all because then you crash your own market, you know? But then what the fuck is the point in having it?

Speaker 5:          00:25:58       I think for them eventually it's about living in a world where you walk into a store and the prices there and bitcoin first. So I think if they hold out for long enough and if it doesn't get fucked over by too much bad stuff like the Mt Gox situation that we could live in a place like that because then you have one price regardless of what country you're in, you know, kind of like a universal language. It could really happen like it's kind of a long shot, but it could actually happen. And in that case that person becomes like science fiction rich, you know, like we're talking about somebody can be worth hundreds of billions of dollars instead of just worth, you know, 10,000 bitcoins or whatever. So science fiction rich. So we kind of got off track. How did this bitcoin collapse? How this gox thing

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       take place? What happened there already? Conspiracy theories that Mt. Gox was like some kind of CIA up to discredit bitcoin really. So that's what somebody tweeted me, but I don't see any evidence of that. Like it sounds like something they would want to do if they thought of it in advance, but I don't think that's what happened. I think it was purely incompetence. This was a website that started like Mt. Gox is short for magic. The gathering online exchange. Really it started as a place where people sold magic cards. No, what not making this up. This every. They deserve everything that got this company, this company didn't know what the fuck they were doing and didn't, didn't know their ass from their elbow in terms of programming languages. Like somebody told me they programmed their trading platform and PHP, which I don't know that much about programming that apparently is like totally not the right language for anything financial.

Speaker 6:          00:27:35       And their whole thing is based on this. And uh, so they're just super incompetent and for whatever reason, they're the ones who stumbled into this massive market of like you're now trading billions of dollars a bit coins and supporting the whole planets, you know, Bitcoin, a market and they weren't ready for that. And just series of fuck ups at every stage of bad pr, bad at communicating what's going on when something doesn't work, they just take it offline, not realizing the implications of what you're going to scare the shit out of the whole market if you just take shit off line and don't tell people in advance. And uh, it looks like they got hacked by somebody that somebody found an exploit, took the money, even though the money that was in cold storage somehow, which was supposed to be impossible, but I'm sure they weren't competent enough to have fucked up somewhere along the way.

Speaker 6:          00:28:20       And now we're in the situation we're in now where people are panicked. But, uh, the good news is that there are other exchanges out there that are much more credible backed by real companies. And they're coming online. There are a couple in the US, they're coming online, which was pretty cool because I want to see us be in on the action. I don't want to see this be something that's just happening in Japan and so many places. I'm sorry, how did, how did someone break in like how do you get that money? Like what do you, what are you actually doing? How are you getting that money? Okay. So yeah, Bitcoin itself has not been hacked and as far as I know, it's never been hacked. Like the actual protocol is 100 percent. I don't want to say perfect, but if I send you money, there's certainty that I've sent it to you.

Speaker 6:          00:29:02       And uh, in this case they were using something called transaction malleability, which I, full disclosure, don't fully understand this shit, but pretty much what I think it is is like a, if I write you a check, you have to wait until that check clears before you actually assume you have the money. And in this case Mt. Gox was assuming based on unconfirmed transactions that they had money or that they were sending money. And you apparently, if you know anything about Bitcoin, you can't do this. And the other exchanges weren't doing it. And so it'd be like if you got a million dollar check, it could totally be a rubber check. You don't know until it's actually cleared. You can't trade on that million dollars. If bitcoin

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       really does become an emerging currency that the whole world adopts. What a great movie this is going to be. Oh, it's going to be amazing. The Gathering Dorks stumble upon this billion dollar. You just see them sitting around. He, um, we're worth a billion dollars. Wouldn't it be cool if we had, if we had girls and money and then they switched over to bitcoin and seeing this fat guy named Mark Karpeles is the CEO of Mt. Gox. Is this him? That is him. What a fucking Dork. He is. Today's sorry buddy. No, I think that bitcoin is going. He's hiding now. They don't know his whereabouts. So he's either hiding or probably being tortured somewhere. Who the fuck knows? Oh my God. Three hundred $50. Million dollars because of this guys. Fuck up. It's a big fuck up. Oh my God, that's a big fuck up. Can you imagine how many people want to kill him? That's real money to the $350,000,000 for folks that understand this. This is not like people trading, you know, like fucking magic. The gathering corns. Yeah. It's a liquid market. You could buy $350, million dollars worth of laptops if you wanted to. You could actually. Tigerdirect is right, but yeah, and then also vegas casinos. There's two casinos that are allowing bitcoin. There's many. There's many emerging companies or we're up into this pretty much every day on it was even thinking about getting involved. They should. They should.

Speaker 5:          00:30:58       I don't know about that. This. Well. This is just going to be a blip on the radar. Oh, I don't know how many blips this is. Nonstop Bitcoin, negative news. I don't. I think justice news alone is going to make people not like invest or do anything like maybe in the short term, but I had the CEO of coin market on my podcast the other day and he runs one of the US exchanges. They're actually based in Santa Monica and he didn't sound phased at all. He told me this is a couple of hours before Mt. Gox actually came out as being insolvent. He told me on the podcast, I think they're insolvent and I think they need to disappear as soon as possible. Not Disappears and run away, but just like disappear from the bitcoin ecosystem so that more credible companies like us can step in and do this shit in a way that's legal and regulated and actually backed by real investors.

Speaker 5:          00:31:45       And uh, he didn't sound concerned about. He's kind of like, well, yeah, this are shitty competition is going out of business and now we can take over. And uh, I wish I knew enough to know whether or not he's correct. That sounds very comforting if you're. I think as long as people continue to watch porn and like pay web cam, girls with bitcoins, as long as people continue to like online gambling, as long as you have libertarians who want to stash away some of their money in case there's some kind of financial apocalypse, as long as you have those three things, there's always going to be bitcoin demand. That's a question. You're not allowed to online gamble in the US with money. Can you online gamble with bitcoin though? I'm sure it's a highly gray area that that would be a way to get bitcoin rockin just tell people that they could gamble in bitcoin. Well, there are casinos in Vegas now that have started accepting too, but I think that online it'd be online. It's prohibitive

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       because the online, a lack of online gambling is what crushed the, uh, international pool league. He had a, uh, this Kevin Trudeau, you know, that scam artists, that guy. Those are the secrets that they don't want you to know about, which is why I'm putting it in a book for everybody to fucking read weight loss secrets. They don't want you to know about I just people that are hiding information or that guy put together this huge multiple million dollar professional pool league and he was going to market it based on the idea that you could gamble on the matches online and right when it was coming out, right when the invested all the money, they changed the laws and it was just a force out all the online gambling, all the online casinos and online and all that. [inaudible] dot com, all those different places to have. Those guys all got fucked dudes had to leave the country.

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       Like that bodog guy. He had a boy dog fight. There's an organization of fight organization. He had to leave the company, the country. You can't come to America if it comes to America, they'll arrest them and it's just because of online gambling, you know, it's, it's so gross. It makes me so sick. The idea that they can somehow another prevent people from gambling, but you don't prevent them from gambling in Vegas, you know, prevent them in Atlantic city. You don't prevent them. An Indian casinos, you don't prefer them in car casinos, just like they've decided arbitrarily to keep people from doing it online because it hurts those casinos or hurts, whatever. Whoever it is that it hurts, they've decided to allow them to prohibit business. They've allowed them to halt competition and innovation because you're by eliminating online gambling, you're not just eliminating online gambling, you're eliminating a lot of different financial transactions.

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       You're eliminating a lot of wagering that is done through credit cards. You're eliminating all sorts of different things. You're. You're stopping a business. You're stopping buildings from being built. You stopping people from being hired, and it is freedom of expression. If you're an adult and you're, why shouldn't you be allowed to spend your money on what you want? Exactly. You're going to force these people to go to Costa Rica. You, I mean you're. You're doing a lot of stupid shit. You're, you're really stopping business. Everything from the construction of buildings with these people, we're gonna use to the employees, the, the financial careers that people could have in online gambling, running websites, legit businesses. Whether you're providing a legit service, but somehow or another this county government got away with stopping all that shit. It's, it really makes me sick. But um, if you could use bitcoin, if, if they could, if that's a legal loophole and you could use bitcoin to gamble on things. God Damn like sports. If you could gamble on the fucking super bowl, a major league baseball, NBA, UFC, boxing, golf. If you could gamble on all that shit. Yeah, that'd be worth billions. Fuck yeah. It would be worth billions. Not only would it be worth billions if people found out that you could actually buy shit with this bitcoin. They would start investing chunks of their portfolio in bitcoins and people would say, hey, you know, I want percent of my finances

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       in bitcoin because I like to gamble. I think the whole porn thing is going to be huge where a lot of guys want to know where I want to tip the girls that they watch on the live cam sites, but they don't because they don't want their credit card linked to the site because then their wife will see it and it'd be a whole shitstorm meddling bitch, but if they can just load up at the local seven, 11 on $50 worth of Bitcoin, have it transferred to their account and then they do that. Can you buy Bitcoin at 7:11? Basically you can use a, like various money services are you used to be able to. But uh, that's where things are headed. I think that we're getting. Are Their ATM machines now coming online? There was one in Boston that I saw a video of.

Speaker 5:          00:36:16       Yeah, I've seen that as well. That's interesting. If they, that would definitely open the door. And for folks who don't know technology, I'm porn opens up the door to technology all the time. I mean when online video, online statistics, all that stuff came from adult stuff. Well, when apple cut flash out, when apple stopped flash on the IPADS and on their laptops and they um, when, when they're on their phones rather when they did that. The what is the other five htp? No, that's the, that's a supplement. Html five html, http get new boots. They put new mood and their computers. But when they started using html five, I mean all the, the porn sites started adopting it. I mean it was like almost instantaneous. We used to not be able to watch porn on your iphone and then pop pow. There it is. There's just like, these are human forces.

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       People need to watch porn. People need to translate it. David Seaman, do they need it? People need to transact. Yeah, they do need it. Fuck yeah. Look, look at the Middle East. I think half the issue with the Middle East is that guys are just not getting off enough. You should put like a thousand rubbing tugs in the Middle East and just see what happens. There's definitely that. And there's, don't quote me on that, but I wouldn't. A postal address like Jabba the hut, you know, that's an issue to you. You're covering them up. No, it's just so repressive and I understand like you got to respect someone's culture, but you also have to respect the fact that a lot of these people living in these societies probably don't want to live that way. That culture is a trap. There's a problem with any suppressive. Culture is a trap and you can't get out of that trap.

Speaker 5:          00:37:50       Especially if that trap is tied to religion. If you're eliminating inflammation, you're eliminating progress, you're eliminating people growing and you're doing another name of religion. You know what, man? I really, if I don't know what God wrote or what he didn't rope, but I highly doubt if he's the way you're describing them, this awesome, amazing guy. I highly doubt he gives a fuck what kind of clothes you wear. That's just me though. I mean, I'm not thinking for God or anything, but I just highly doubt. So what you're dealing with, most likely, I'm not saying definitely, but most likely it's some bullshit written by people and it's poisoned. Your culture absolutely poisoned the very foundations of your culture and won't allow any progress. It will not allow new information. It will not allow consideration of old ways. The way

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       you live is perfect and it will not change. You're going to be cotton camels heads off the fucking dull knives to the end of time, and that's just what it is. What what you're doing is how you're always gonna do it. You're always going to say, I'll walk by. You're always going to fucking dressed that way. You're always going to bow to the east. All that same shit that you've been doing since the beginning of the millennia. You're going to continue to do that. That's nonsense.

Speaker 2:          00:38:58       Well, if you're labeling somebody you disagree with is an infidel or as not an infidel, not a lot of room for reasonable discussion there. You're like, here's my point, and then the other person's point is you're an infidel. If we had a softball team, we would call ourselves the infidels. That'd be dope. A good name for a strip club.

Speaker 1:          00:39:15       Yeah. I have a gre podcast, softball team, costs of the Jerry infidel.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       It wouldn't be a good neighbor. Strip club. Make all the girls. We'll veils belly dance

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       bad. They wouldn't feel bad about seeing their face. She couldn't see him and be like, they're robbing a bank when they're showing you their pussy. Yeah, right. That's a good idea. Actually called the infidels and all girls wear veils. It's not a bad move because a lot of women, you know, I'm thinking it would want to have anonymity.

Speaker 2:          00:39:44       We think so. I think so. I saw a, a as soon as actress at a coffee shop near my place the other day and she was sitting at a table by herself and had on like the big bug eyes, sunglasses, like she's like a praying mantis pretty much. And uh, I just think people can't want that, you know, like maybe you want it five percent of the time. But I think in that particular moment somebody would not want that. Oh, you mean that amount of attention? Yeah. Because if you're a woman in some of these Arab societies, you can't just walk around like American style. Uh, I think it was on one of your podcasts actually some guy was jerking off on a rooftop because he saw like a woman's Vale come down or something like they're very sexually repressed. So you can't even just dress normally in a coffee shop without getting the same kind of attention that over here and a list actress would get.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       Yeah, that's true. Um, well, just the idea that you're supposed to cover your head, right? Always. Always wear a veil like,

Speaker 2:          00:40:36       and it's unsanitary. You think over time.

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       No, not really. I mean, didn't know more than wearing a baseball hat. Right? That's on sanitary.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       I just don't have your hair. Everybody. Everything. Okay. Under there, it actually protects your hair. There you go. Fun in damaged, damage your hair. So it can, we'll definitely damages your face. Well, all this bullshit that people worry about like the uh, cell phone, neuro tower weapons or whatever. And wait a minute, hold on. A people hanging out with people. Tweet me some weird shit. It's like the guys at radio shack can you got to stop fighting with people on twitter, man, you really do. When people say stupid shit to just ignore it and block them, please. Yeah, I've got to do that. You get locked into it and then you're like, I'm retiring from twitter. I get locked into. Like recently I was, it was Sunday morning at 7:00 AM and my phone goes off and I'm like, Oh, what is this? And it's all caps, like hatred from some psycho and I'm just like, take number one, you know, connect your fucking phone to your twitter. I got to turn it off. Of course you no still has

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       it that way. Doug Benson, ladies and gentlemen, you want to fuck with Doug Benson right now? Tweet the shit out of him. Just fucking tweet them. Constantly. Tweet them all day because it's fallen. We'll just. It'll run out of batteries in 10 minutes. I'm like, how long has your battery lasts? Like 10 seconds. I mean, I assumed it was because my iphone is shitty batteries, but allowing the world to text you essentially you're allowing the whole world filled with assholes to text you. Right? I got to turn that off. You know what? This is going to help me more than going a infrared saunas and all the bullshit I do to relax. I'm just going to take twitter off my phone. Yeah, that. Well, you're dealing with too many people. You know when you. When you deal with that many people, you can't have them at their discretion.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       Get in touch with you, right? You have a certain amount of responsibility to try to connect with people online because it's what you do and it's what I do as well, but you can't allow them to just do it at their discretionary time because it's intrusive. Your, your regular life is important. Like you have to be able to have time to reflect. If you don't, you'll never form your own opinions. You're just be constantly inundated with information and other people's activity. You can't do that. You can't allow that. It's. It's a symptom of. It's a symptom of the new world and you know you are experiencing it in extreme form because you're sort of a public figure and you're a journalist and you're controversial. Utah, you cover a lot of very fascinating subjects, so you're going to get a lot more than the average person who has this set up like that.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       It's just too much, man. You can't do it that way. That's very true. Do that. Starting today, my phone would explode if I did that. It would literally shake. It would just shake and just boom. Sparks would fly out of it on your phone, like froze up because of something happened. All these people text you and you're. I was just thinking that I was thinking like the twitter app probably can't handle that many things at once. Just frees up a one time I accidentally gave him my cell phone number out on twitter. I was trying to send it to somebody in a pm and I sent it. I sent it to the whole world and my fucking phone literally just shut off and rebooted. It was like, this has got to be right. I'm going to reboot myself. I've rebooted itself. Just was like, fuck you, and committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       So awesome. It was just my. My inbox filled up in five seconds and then the texts that were coming, there's just. I tweeted something yesterday, somebody sent me that. I was talking about how I felt when my child was born that it was. Oh, I was thinking about how crazy it must be. How many different babies being born right now? If you could see them all in real time in front of you, like on a giant screen. It'd be like a baby invasion. I mean you don't think about it because in that hospital room, while that one's being born, well, somebody sent me a tweet and that tweet is a link that shows in real time every baby being born all around the world and it is a fucking invasion. It's scary APP. Yeah, it is like if Obama gave out his cell phone, it's like heaven. It's just one baby baby, baby, baby, baby, Switzerland, Africa, Indonesia, China, and I know and that's just the reported babies. That's not the little tikes shit out in the bottom of a fucking grass hut in the middle of the jungle. They didn't count those. They only counted the ones. The ones that are in the census. Yeah, I mean, do you see Brian find the link? Was it yesterday? Yeah, it was A. I quoted it as a. As a retweet. Instead of a retweet. I quoted it.

Speaker 7:          00:44:52       Oh, here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:44:54       It's crazy. It's so nuts. You go to it and it's. What is the website for folks who want to get to it?

Speaker 7:          00:45:00       Yeah. Google.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       Dr. Com. No. What does it say? A bunch of Google drive.com. Sounds legit. We'll look at that. Those are the babies. See those babies on both sides.

Speaker 6:          00:45:14       Holy Shit. That is scary.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       Isn't that incredible? Yeah. Those are all babies.

Speaker 7:          00:45:20       It's going to be deaths going about.

Speaker 6:          00:45:25       I don't see a lot of us second. Not a lot of us births.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       How is that only google? Dr. Com. That's all it is. Why? It's good. Good. Dr. Com, black sides host. Oh, a bunch of other shit. So the stuff that we can't see, that's all like real blurry. That's the other stuff.

Speaker 6:          00:45:38       Do you think this is what the NSA sees? They see like every new human being coming online?

Speaker 1:          00:45:42       Yeah. The NSA is, they're paying attention 24 hours a day to every one of these babies. Make sure they're not fucking doing anything illegal. So get all these babies is crazy. There's a fucking. And I feel like we're going to run out of oxygen or something. It's terrifying man. And I don't see a lot of American flags either. Man. I see a lot of those other countries, a lot of the red Chinese flag that bothers me as an American. I think we need to do our job and do some more fucking. Most of the deaths. China is number one. Most birth India. Look at that. It just stopped. What if freaked out? No. But your computer crash? No. Well what if they just stopped having babies? What is one day? We went on that thing and it was a day where there was no babies. That movie with, uh, with Clive Owen.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       Children of men? Yeah. When people stopped being fertile or something stupid, you know, well that is the, um, the people that are not dooming gloomers about overpopulation, their idea is that as time goes on, what's going to happen is the cultures, like third world cultures that are like really into having a massive amounts of child children, childbirths, those are going to become more developed and as they become more developed, we're actually gonna have a decrease in population. That's the non doom and gloomers. They obviously don't have this website on bookmark. If they did, they would see the fucking invasion in real time see it happening. Oh my God, how, how we're going to have enough oil.

Speaker 6:          00:47:10       Well, there's a theory that the more people you have in an area, the more kind of like intelligent productivity you have. So higher population doesn't lead to the Malthusian meltdown where people starve and kill each other to get back into a lower population realm. Instead. It's the high population itself. That's what is leading

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       to innovation. And somewhere along that innovation can keep up with the higher population. That makes sense. Yeah. So it's basically you look at humans like kind of like a network capacity. It makes sense. What, what concerns me most? Those are just the actual natural physical resources. Oh yeah. I watched him. Pollution and pollution. I watched that movie. Jiro dreams of Sushi. That's a great. I've talked about that movie like 30 times. I'm obsessed with it. Really interesting. Weird. You know. First of all I learned two things. One, I would never want to be a fucking Sushi chef because they work too hard. Those fucking people work hard, man. The apprentices who are, they stay apprentice. So they're like 50 years old. Yeah. How about the fact that the guy worked on making eggs for like 10 years before he got it right. And then when the guy told him he did it right, you start crying.

Speaker 5:          00:48:17       What? You cooked an egg, right. That's why that movie is so beautiful, you know, because we will be sick of that shit after 15 minutes. This guy has a 10 seat room. It's a 10 seat room in the Tokyo subway station that's booked out for months are booked out from us and it's the best Sushi in the world apparently. And the guy, I mean his, his son's 50 years old and his son goes to the fish market every day and buys from the same guy who's like literally got a flashlight on the tuna and touching it with his fingers and he has to make sure it's, he has a feel for the texture, the texture will directly contribute or directly correlate with great flavor. Like he knows what textures the right one. Then they know like how to age the tuna and you know how long for an old tuna, how long for a young tuna.

Speaker 5:          00:49:03       Fucking crazy shit man is a true art artisans. When you imagine if we had that in the US, like at every level of our society, somebody putting out a new APP, like the new facebook APP is like, I'm not sure if this is perfected yet and they just study it for the next six months before they release it. Yeah. No shit man. And I mean there's no money to be made and what this guy is doing either, I mean there's enough money to keep afloat, I'm sure, but he's got a 10 seat fucking place and these people talk about his Sushi, like you know, restaurant tours and restaurant critics. And they say they get nervous when they go there. They get nervous when they meet him. The guy takes the same fucking subway everyday, sits in the same seat, Exxon at the same stop. He's 85 fucking years old and he's been working every day since he was like fucking 20.

Speaker 5:          00:49:51       Look at what an old boss as though if he comes back up there. Yes. Yeah, no, that's his son. His son's 50 like everything about the way they cook. The place is fucking amazing and made me want to fly to Japan. Maybe want a book. I bet you can't even book online, but you've got to go there in person and get your reservations. But it made me want to try this Sushi and finding what the fuck is all about. He probably gives you like a riddle, like a Zen Koan that you have to solve and if you solve it, he's like, okay, three months from now launch, we're on, and if I was going to do what I would want to do it quick before that whole place is nuclear war Godzilla shows up. It was, this shit

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       is pretty, uh, unsettling. Very unsettling. But you know, there was a sign

Speaker 3:          00:50:32       just that went there and was catching fish from right off the shore and they tested 50 tests a flounder I think. What's the other word for a flounder? Good grounds. Old men have been the sole ground fish flatfish one of those flat fish. But the point is those, those fisher, the, they stay in that area, they're not migratory. And it was, you could eat. It was fun. Yeah, it was fine to eat. So what he's saying is that the ocean is so fucking enormous that it's not really having the same effect that people think it has. Yeah, it is scary stuff. The water leak is very scary. It's still dangerous. Dissipates out enough that the ocean. Yeah, the ocean is so goddamn big that right now it's okay, but the real issue is not just Fukushima, it's these nuclear plants in general. I try to make it relative.

Speaker 3:          00:51:20       Someone like I had a conversation with a friend who is a very pro business and very pro, you know, nuclear power and the benefits of nuclear power and he's talking about these few places where the issues have arisen and I said, well, okay, I just want you to think about the amount of time that nuclear power's been here. Okay. Now think about the amount of nuclear power plants that exist now. Think about how many of the men have had catastrophic failures only to write only to. You're right, but those two, those places are fa hucked forever. There's two and it's less than 100 years of nuclear power. How long do you think people bit around what if people around another 20,000 years stop and think about how many of those nuclear power plants are gonna fuck, fuck everything around them. There's two places right now, Chernobyl and this place, and then there's a three mile island or four mile island or whatever the fuck it is. That place is kind of fucked, but not quite as fucked.

Speaker 6:          00:52:19       I don't think we know enough about it. I think that we're too. It's too new for us and we don't have the the timetable that you would need to do it properly. Sure. You're absolutely like our lifespans are just too short. We're like fucking fruit flies working with this technology that has ramifications. That will be around for thousands of years. Why don't our lifespan is nothing compared to the lifespan of any kind of leak will. Also we. We grew up in a time where these things that already existed and we didn't have any say in their construction and so they were manufactured by people kind of assumed there may have been around all that. Technology's probably oldest fuck by now. It is old as fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:52:55       The one in Fukushima is old as fuck. It's outdated technology, but they kind of assumed upon construction that with innovation, with progress in the future, there's going to be able to be a way to correct all these issues. Well, there's not. There's still isn't.

Speaker 6:          00:53:09       At least with coal power plants, even though those are messy too, it's only fucking up the present. It's not like you're leaving this thing that for thousands of years is going to be a, you know, making children have birth defects and stuff. It's like, you know, it's messy when it's drawn out of the earth. It's probably not good for the at all,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       but it's temporary. It's not something that's destroying areas for long time.

Speaker 1:          00:53:30       Yeah, it's interesting. It's like you, you look at what people are willing to accept and not willing to accept just in the name of, you know, having fuel just to the name of progress just in the name of financial reward and it's, it's kind of scary how flippant people are about polluting the ocean, about polluting the BP oil spill. You had Peter Schiff on and we were talking about the BP thing and you know, he was talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       Yeah, I listened to that one. He, he kind of gets under my skin because a lot of the limited government stuff I can latch onto and agree with, but then there's something, I don't know how to describe it. It's like there's not a certain humanism there that you need to have. Yes, like everything doesn't have to be in your framework of the free market principle. That's great for a lot of Shit. If you want to get the best water or the best soda or the best weed, it's probably a good idea to get free markets working there. So you have competition. It doesn't have to be for every single facet of life.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       Well the real issue with him is environmental. That's the real issue. His willingness to, you know, the fracking thing like his, his concerned about fracking was so it was, it was, it was really funny. Like talking to them about people that have had their land is destroyed forever and he was saying, well they got millions of dollars. Most people, they got money that would've never been able to get. They got hush money, but it's still, their land is fucked like that. The money is all. It's all relative. Like what's a million dollars to Peter Schiff? It's probably not nearly as much as it is to those people. So for, for Peter Schiff, a million dollars or whatever the fuck these people, that's worth it to destroy a piece of property essentially for as long as

Speaker 2:          00:55:09       people wasn't around. What was weird about that too is I think you asked him about the environmental impact and he said there's nothing wrong with fracking. There's no environment. The environmental impact, and we know that's not true. Like just google it. It's all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       It's not true at all. There's over a thousand documented wells that have been polluted from fracking. Yeah. You know, the idea is that if fracturing works exactly according to plan, it's so deep in the ground that you're not going to disturb wells, but it doesn't work according to plan. It's a crazy business. What'd you do? You're pumping water into the center of the earth. You're creating earthquakes. You know, and I've had a lot of people google me, like you need to get up to date with your research, like really right wingey type people who are pro business, who by the way almost always financially struggling but, or clearing the way for the one day when in the future they have money, they're going to go out, you know, they're gonna, they're gonna need the regulations to be kind of light because they want to make some money in this, this economy. Well, all these people, like I would send them to all these websites and then they would just vanish like you can't say anything, so I'll just send you, I'll send you all the links. I'll send you the fucking one of the ceos of exon petitioning to not have fracking on his property. One of the richest.

Speaker 2:          00:56:17       No, fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing. It doesn't sound like something that's good for the earth.

Speaker 1:          00:56:22       Yeah. Exxon CEO

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       is hilarious. So he doesn't want it near his property. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't want fracking. He thinks it's going to fuck with his property values of. Yeah, it does, Dude. Yeah. Exxon CEO doesn't want fracking facility near his US home. He files a lawsuit. You fucking dirty, man. You're a dirty man. Rex Tillerson, he is that his name? Rex tillerson sounds like a dinosaur. It sounds like an industrialist for like the 18 hundreds. So scary. You ever seen there will be blood. Yes. Yeah. It sounds like one of those guys. Exactly. Yeah. This is a. Oh, this is not an anti fracking lawsuit and experts said nothing. Could be further from the truth. Yes. A lot of things could be further from the truth. It could be that a quarter is actually a Gremlin. Who Lives on the moon and likes to suck. Baby. Dick's. Okay. That's further from the truth.

Speaker 5:          00:57:15       You fucking dummy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Oh, the earth is really a Frisbee. Is that further from the truth? You fucking cunt. You shitbag lawyer said they will not be a sponsor of your podcast anytime soon. They can all fuck themselves. Citizens of Bartonville described as a wealthy community, which you'd expect that giving the houses of the chief of Enron have sued to stop the tower. The tower is being built by cross timbers water supply. It would be a 15 story building adjacent to Tillerson's 83 acre horse ranch, not far from an 18 acre homestead among the others who opposed the project or people not exactly known for their environmental concerns form a US House. Majority leader, tick amny and his wife, for example, all these fucking rich country they're putting in their neighborhood and they don't want it. Oh, you guys are fine.

Speaker 5:          00:58:12       When it was in Baltimore, all right. You guys were fine when it was in the middle of Pennsylvania shitting into a river that people like to fish in. Fuck all you. Fuck all you fucking criminals. You shitty environmental criminals. You guys are ruining the earth. This is not a way to do it. You can't just pump water and chemicals into the ground because we know that there's gas and oil there. That's county shit. This is a terrible idea. Well then we extract the water afterwards, Brian dunning sales. No worries. Afterwards, we simply extract the water you ever heard his video on. It even takes on it and affected accent like an what hosts. There's some no worries, like peaceful accept. Talk like a fool, like, oh, don't worry. Why? Hydraulic fracturing. That's literally what he sounds like when he talks about it, explaining how simple it is.

Speaker 5:          00:59:04       Oh, it's only poisoned to thousand wells so far. It's only been around for a few decades. Don't worry. What's a thousand places that are poisoned forever. No worry. I think we're predisposed to listen to people who sound reasonable. Yeah, reasonable and what happened saying David, seaman, let's be reasonable. Hydraulic fracturing is very safe and should ask for it in your community today, forward in your own home. Hydraulically fracture your own gas from the ground below you. That's like the reverse mortgage guy that's on at nights and convincing old people who a cash in their home equity, you know, like it's a good way to. It shows him in front of a sports car and it's like, yeah, you get a sports car but you also lose the fucking equity to your house. I'm like, dude, no longer own the house you live in, but at least that is just financial money comes and goes and is there.

Speaker 5:          00:59:57       You're not poisoning the fucking very water that people can drink. You're not changing the water like people used to be able to use that to fertilize crops, to feed their animals, to drink. Now they drink it. They get like neuro toxins. They get like anybody's in nerves. Stop working. Anybody who thinks that's totally okay. I would recommend the prescription of Yoga, meditation, weed, Brownies, as long as permissible by law. All those things would all three of those things would be the Trifecta of not being a dick anymore. The weed brownies or the most introspective in like if you want to think about a drug that makes you consider everything that you're doing wrong, God damn those things get to the heart of it helps me see like the other person's perspective and then even if I want to go ahead with what I'm doing, at least I've seen it from their point of view, so it's not coming from a place of ignorance coming from, Oh, I see both sides, now I can do what I want.

Speaker 5:          01:00:50       Whereas before, you're just the person who doesn't see how the world is perceiving it and it's kind of scary. It's scary to me that I went that long without, uh, using that stuff. Well, it's the, the reason for a lot of the people that have these negative opinions on marijuana brownies or cookies is that most of the times that they're used recreationally, most of the Times people are using them just sort of have fun with or they're fucked up. They're already drunk and then they associate being hung over and like making bad decisions with the marijuana has nothing to do with that. What people think of it as more of a party thing, which you kind of can be mean and it is fun to get high and watch star wars with your buddies. It is, it's fun. You know, if you have a bunch of people over the house and he'd go, let's eat pot brownies and watch star wars.

Speaker 5:          01:01:32       Fuck yeah. You know, it's fun. It's also fun to watch star trek by yourself like every day on that. But it also. But besides being fun, it most certainly can be a tool for psychological expert exploration. You really can, you can explore some areas of your consciousness that maybe you didn't know were really troubling you, and then all of a sudden they get dragged into the forefront and some spotlights get turned on them and you didn't even know that you had some sort of a subliminal or subconscious hiding of these ideas. Yeah. I'm not a scientist at all, but I really believe that stuff like that has evolved alongside us. And that's part of the reason why it's not harmful. Why nobody ever ods on marijuana is that we've had time to adapt to it and it's adapted to us and we have this symbiotic relationship where it's making us a more introspective

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       and we're able to innovate as a result. And because of that, we tend to grow more marijuana, which keeps it alive and keeps it thriving. So it's like this, uh, this thing like a coral reef almost. And then we come along with modern society. We make all this shit illegal just for the sake of it. And we do away with things that people have had is basic tools for most of human history. You think about it like this shit is only been illegal for what? Like 70 years?

Speaker 3:          01:02:45       Yeah. The main thing you're dead on. I think that's exactly what's going on and I think it's changing. I don't think you can stop the change that's currently underway. I think what Colorado did and what Seattle or Washington state did that those decisions were made by people they. And then you see that not only is the sky's not falling, but those people are making a lot of money and then then it just opens up and now that the banks are going to be allowed to take the money from the Colorado dispensary's, what do they call them? It's legal. It's not a dispenser. If it's legal, is it a pot store

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       dispensary? If caregiver shit, maybe not your share giver because it's not medical, it's just the store. Then Rato was just selling weed. They just gave up on the whole medical thing and they're like, yeah, we're just selling weed. Come on in Seattle still hanging back. They're like, oh, well what are you guys doing? I think they'll see that people are not going to go crazy and it's going to help the local economy a lot and then other states who want to adopt some form of that. Yeah. Colorado is like the crazy friend that eats the mushrooms first car. I was like, you guys share that. That's not a much of a kill you. I'll fucking eat it, man. Colorado's like your crazy friend who's like real skinny but never gets sick and he's got a cowboy hat on and he's like, I'll eat that fucking Brownie Brown.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       So Colorado just goes, hey man, we'll just fucking start selling it and we'll see what's up. And so all these people have started these huge businesses and within the first day, within the first seven hours they'd made millions of dollars. I mean the, the amount of money that's being there, this tourism, like people are driving from Wyoming to go to Colorado. So they combined the cuts. It cuts down on crime. I have a friend who actually is a manager at one of the dispensary is out there in Denver and she was telling me when one of their dispensary's moves into a neighborhood, all the people stopped going to their dealer and they just come into the store and that's their new place obviously, because they want to do something that's less risky. Yeah, you've just fucked all those dealers out of their money like that's done. Now it's being taxed now. It's being regulated. It's helping people because people are being paid jobs that actually pay well instead of just one drug dealer taking all the money and it's interesting for their own. They can grow their own as well.

Speaker 3:          01:04:54       Well, you know, that's another beautiful thing about it. You don't have to worry about the cops coming to your house and breaking in your front door because you got a plant somewhere in your closet. You don't have to worry about that anymore. It's okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:04       It's legal. I really liked the balance that La is struck where there are dispensaries you can buy from and you see the green, whatever it is. Yeah. The plus sign, but it's not in your face, so if you're somebody who doesn't like or it makes you paranoid when you do it or you just have a conservative upbringing, it's not something where you're constantly confronted by it. I think that's cool. It's like if you want it, it's very easy to get. If you don't. It doesn't have to be a part of your life. That's the way it should

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       like it in their neighborhood. I think. I thought it was really kind of hilarious. I was driving down the street with a friend of mine and it was in his neighborhood and there's like the green plus signs and he's like, you know, these fucking things are all over my neighborhood and I'm like soon as the liquor store. Stupid is the liquor store right there by the way, you smoke pot. What are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          01:05:46       And no, nobody. Nobody leaves the dispensary looking unhappy. Like people always leave liquor stores looking all bummed out.

Speaker 1:          01:05:52       People leave dispensary's looking the same way they leave when they nutting their pants, when they go and get a lap dance like, oh boy, I can't believe I got away with that. They get in their car and they drive away like some kind of a criminal. I think, um, you know, people just have this attitude that, you know, having a dispensary somehow or another different than having a liquor store. This guy's got a liquor store, right? Me Drive out of his house, take a left, go down the hill, Bam. There's liquor store is a fucking dispensary a mile away from that is like in my neighborhood. So what's all this green plus sign nonsense.

Speaker 2:          01:06:28       Or when you're out with somebody and they smell it on a sidewalk and they're like, they're kind of offended by it. I'm like, why are you offended? This is fucking cool. It's peaceful. It's if people are having a good time around you, it doesn't mean that there's crime or danger. Not only that smells good. Yeah. You got caught a plus sign instead of a green cross. You're just like, no religion on across. Yeah. It's supposed to be like Red Cross screen, cross. No, no, I think that's probably true. Green Cross. Yeah. But I mean even the cross is not a cross anymore. It's a plus sign. It's not religious, but it's not. It's good to have crosses an extended bottom. There's a difference in the shape. Essentially. It's like the Red Cross's cross medicinal use. That's why it's a cross. That's why it's a green cross. Yeah. But you can't really call it a cross. I like plus better anyways because it doesn't have any kind of religious connotation. Yeah, I mean it. Was that really what Red Cross is supposed to be though. Is that why? Why is it okay? I don't know. Okay. Let's Google it. What? That's one of the great things about being a journalist is a, when you get to the point, you just realize you can say no to things and that's the best way to do it because you have google. You don't have to like draw on what little, you know, you know what I mean? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:34       No worries. Um, what. So the green plus sign on pot dispensaries. Okay. Um Hm. It doesn't say,

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       how has this not been asked a thousand times over in like reading reddit trees.

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       It's an interesting thing because like a lot of these stores, that green plus sign, it's become so universal that's, that's all it has on the sign to have a green plus sign and then I'll say like, w, you know, the whatever, you know, West Valley caregivers was one of them. So it was Wv, CGI, that's all it said. And then you get near the West valley caregivers like, what the fuck are you actually selling? And they get in there and just tanks. Uh, we'd be like, oh, I see what you're doing. Unfortunately that place that I used to go to, my favorite spot, the government told them that they had to close down because they had opened up a too late, like after a certain amount of time they weren't approved or something like that. And the dude was like, he was very nervous about it because they had shut, gotten shut down once for something else.

Speaker 1:          01:08:33       And the guy who owned it previously wound up going to jail. He was, he was one of the few people that got popped. Actually he didn't know him that when he owned another one, but I know one of the guys who got popped and wind up doing time and then there's some guys in San Francisco, those guys, a pot university guys, whatever the fuck they are. Cannabis University, those guys are still duking it out in court. Pot, pot, pot, McCormick, todd McCormick, todd mccormick. Our friend is involved in some legal bullshit. Again, it's crazy. I only do delivery nowadays. I don't even go to this store is a smart move man. Yeah, I mean look, there's, there's plenty of weed and it's way easier to get and it's way more relaxed but it's still sketchy federally and if someone comes in after Obama, which is very likely, that is a more repressive because this, this Obama thing has been a goddamn mess.

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       I mean he, what he's done and what we thought he was going to do are so polar opposite and you know, they didn't stop the Dea from rating these medical marijuana facilities. There's a lot of raids during his time if you want to go and look at how many raids took place during Obama's time. It's been quite substantial. The blowback from that has also been substantial and it's very damaging to his party because he's essentially a Republican in wolf clothing. What I mean, a lot of the shit that I've done outside of social things have been like really, really similar to what the Bush administration did. There's been a lot of really negative shit that's happened with the dea breaking into these pots doors, putting fucking boots on kids' necks and taken like there was one that they did where they got caught doing all this because all the film was sent remotely to another location, like constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:10:16       It was currently sent so no one can steal the hard drives. The security cameras. We're still recording, so the so seed got to see them put their boots on this kids neck, throw him to the ground. Just a kid. Just a young 20 year old kid working in a place that's just pull all the money. Just people being thugs. They steal the money. Well, if they know that these people aren't threats, you your break, you see 20 year old college kid is working there and national security threat investigation, you know who these people are, you know who you're arresting and you've got your boot on his neck. One of the people who are trying to relax, people are trying to find like more, uh, healthy outlets for their anxiety or their uncertainty. So the point is there's probably going to be someone could easily bribe a politician to go hard on these things with the new administration office. If there was a big push by the pharmaceutical industry, it was a big push by the alcohol industry, big push by whatever prison guards union, whoever it needs to be. The can grease the wheels

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       to get them to be harder on marijuana. It could conceivably happen that the genie's not totally out of the bottle yet, but I think that the chances of that happening are thankfully not that high because the cat's out of the bag. The public knows that marijuana is not a bad thing. Now it's a good thing. And that's a very, that's a very hard thing to. How can you outdo that at this point? Doesn't matter how many reefer madness as you put out, people have come to the conclusion that it's actually not bad for you. Did you see? And what about her? She was on Piers Morgan talking about pot. I'm sure she's against it and put it on and coulter on Piers Morgan talking about pot, not just against it. She's so ridiculous. It's so hilarious because first of all it's working, right? We're talking about her.

Speaker 5:          01:11:57       So obviously her trolling people like that just want to stay in the media and they don't realize the real harm they're doing to the, the national discourse. I agree with she, she got, she got you to mention her name just now and now she's going to get booked on another show because of this. So will be on the today show and that's great. So she can sell more books, but she's fucking over people who actually rely on what they see on tv and she's just fucking up the whole discourse. You got it, Brian? Five seconds. Yeah. She's, um, she's a terrible person. I mean, what she's doing is for her own benefit and that the trolling when you have,

Speaker 8:          01:12:34       why is it illegal? Cannabis, cigarettes, alcohol, I answer. You're going to interrupt me and say, no, it's not true. That. Explain why. Well, I kept trying to. When you had been dropping. Now I'm going to explain now. So don't interrupt. Um, look, the sole purpose for smoking pot or eating a pot Brownie is to get high. That is not true with alcohol.

Speaker 5:          01:12:56       Okay. Pause it right there. She's wrong, right? They're like, what is crazy? What does that mean? Who gets he gets he drinks not to get drunk. Yeah. I drink whiskey for the taste. Imagined he fucking sitting around drinking whiskey. Like imagine if they came up with alcohol free whiskey and they sold it in those big arnold palmer lemonade cans with alcohol free whiskey. They're trying to do that with weed. They're trying to give you the uh, the benefits without the high, like extract that and put it in a pill. I think that would fuck people over. No, no, no. They're actually the scientific research behind that is for extract cbd. It's for pain is for micro under chronic pain that they don't want to get high, but okay, that's different. My thinking was that they're kind of like, oh, you can use the medical benefits as long as you don't get high from it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:41       And I think that this is totally just my own perspective. I really think that part of the medicinal properties of marijuana is that it allows you to see things differently and I think there's much more of a connection between the mental and the physical than we're willing to accept in our Western society. And I feel like most humans up until about 100 years ago took most of what I'm saying for granted. Like you remember reading books like novels of the 18 hundreds where somebody's sick and their doctor says, go live somewhere, like go live in the countryside. You'll feel better. And they would prescribe this shit actually works because if you're less stressed

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       out and you're in a better environment and you get better, your body knows what to do. And, uh, we've totally, like, we try to be so clinical with everything that we can't let somebody just get high and fucked up for a few hours and figure out their own shit. It has to be very clinical, you know, you can't actually feel something that's altered state of consciousness,

Speaker 3:          01:14:28       although I agree with you on that. I think the scientific principle or the scientific reasoning behind extracting CBDS, it just so that people who have injuries can have pain medication that's natural and have it while they're at work. Yeah, that makes sense. Don't get hooked up or. Hi, I'm thinking of something else then I gotta use the bathroom. So. No, I don't think there's anything wrong with what you're saying because I think you're right in a lot of ways as well. But I think that the, um, there's a bunch of reasons why they extract cbd from cannabis and they're not all, it's not all, you know, the, the man wants to keep you down. So play this fucking wacky bitch player some more

Speaker 8:          01:15:03       or a 14 year old going to everybody. Everybody drinks alcohol to get slightly higher than when they start drinking it. Julie Pierce Morgan. Absolutely. I am done TV after drinks. I bet you you have to you right now that will explain a lot of things. Have you. Would you please let me finish one? Tendons, Piers Morgan will take your rainbow. Enjoy wine. They drink wine for a purpose. Over $800. Bottles of wine. Perhaps you have a warm feeling. It does not. You can tell if somebody's been smoking pot. They're eyes are red. They giggle at everything and by the way, they're incapable of carrying on the normal. Have you ever smoked pot? No, I haven't. Never know.

Speaker 3:          01:15:42       Hold on. Pause. How ridiculous that they're incapable of carrying on the normal functions of life. I do Jujitsu. I'm high. I do comedy while I'm high. I do in this podcast. Hi. I do almost every radio show ever do high that the normal functions of life, like what? We go to the movies high all the time. Go to dinner. Hot all the time. Like what is she? What is she basing it off as? Does she have one ex boyfriend that's a pothead that she's basing opiodes about? Stop and think about that because she's dating. If that is the case, she's dating a guy who's willing to tolerate her, so just imagine what kind of a fucking idiot he's going to be an o. He couldn't. He couldn't function well. Jesus Christ, he pro. It was probably paralytic. Just being around your fucking shitbag personality. I'm imagine that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:30       Imagine that woman, that's your girlfriend. Oh, he couldn't. Couldn't function in life. So is that. Or if it's her friends, like she says, she knows a lot of potheads. She has potheads have friends, you know what she's doing. Is that by just trolling like that? See, that might've been okay. That controlling that she did when she started doing it because when she started doing it, she was trying to get an alert coming up some, some lawyers on that thing. When she started trolling like that, it was probably pre-internet, you know, I mean she was probably doing that shit way before.

Speaker 6:          01:17:02       The only way for her to get attention and the platform, but now that she has a platform, she should use it for good instead of glee. We'll stop this information.

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       Sub being a silly bitch like you know, have a nuanced point of view. Can you do that? Well, what can it not just be a right wing fucking chatterbox. So like people like that who claimed to be limited government and conservative [inaudible]. Exactly. It seems to me like they pretty much just want lower taxes because if you really believed in limited government, how the fuck can the government tell you that you can't put something that's first of all safe in your own body and the comfort and safety of your own fucking home when you're an American citizen and supposedly live in a free society, you should be able to do that in some way. Do I think it should be taxed and regulated? Absolutely. Keep it safe. Keep it on the books, but why shouldn't you be allowed to do that? I'm sure she doesn't have a real argument against that, so it's only ad Hominem.

Speaker 5:          01:17:50       It's well, they're lazy and you're like, well, what about the Beatles? Were they lazy? What about Steve Jobs? Is he lazy? You know, like you're just isolating one anecdotal fucking thing. Exactly. And that's not. I can make an argument against alcohol based on some guy outside. He was drunk in front of a liquor store. That doesn't mean you shouldn't go out drinking with your friends. Not only that, look what she's using as an example she's talking about while you were in the bathroom, she was talking about, uh, you know, you could drink it and have a warm feeling like, come on. You're. So what you're saying is you can't smoke just a little bit of pot and just relax a little. You can have a very mild pot candy. There's a, a pot candy that speed weed has. It's God damn perfect. His God damn perfect.

Speaker 5:          01:18:30       You can have one and it's just a mild edge. Really reduce search. Smile. So mild, like really like to play pool. I like to take to heart candy one. Yeah. But one one is great. It's like you don't feel perplexed. You don't get that. Like what were we talking about? You don't get any of that. It's a dosage issue. It's the same thing with everything. The idea that alcohol is more, you know, you could easily under dosed with alcohol and just have a warm feeling, but you can't do that with marijuana. That's so foolish. It's so dumb and it's so ignorant to human physiology. It's so ignorant to all the different things that we use on a daily basis where if you overuse them, they would fucking kill you. I mean, there's a huge amount of medications that people take on a daily basis where if they took 20 times more than they were supposed to take their dead, you know, salt, 10 ounces of salt, you're a dead person.

Speaker 5:          01:19:26       She's in sleeping pills. Fuck yeah. Tylenol, pms, and tylenol is apparently really bad for you. If you drank, you should not take tylenol. I didn't know this until a couple of years ago. If you drink, you should not take tylenol as your hangover cure. You should take some advil. Acetaminophen is really tough on your liver. Oh yeah. That stuff's not good for you. I know a guy who takes, he takes, this is a crazy cocktail, but he takes adderall. He takes Xanax and he takes ambien. What does have been prescribed? What is that about exactly? What is that about? Like, I'm going to speed myself up so I can slow myself down so I can relax. Speeds himself up. Then apparently you get a little freaked out from that. So he needs something to relax and that's where the xanax comes in. But then he can't go to bed at night.

Speaker 5:          01:20:10       So he needs the ambien. I totally POW, POW. I totally do that with coffee and alcohol though, because what happens is you have like a meeting at 6:00 PM so you get all caffeinated and then it's 6:45 and you're in your apartment. You're like, fuck, I need to chill out. So you start, you start drinking because you're so amped from the caffeine. Well, I used to have a buddy that had a crack habit and uh, I used to go with them, uh, and uh, go to the liquor store when he was fucked up and he wanted to calm down, he would go to the liquor store and he would buy a 40 ounce just to like bring his heart rate down. Wow. And he would, uh, yeah, a healthy living right there. Oh, he's dead. Oh, sorry about that. Yeah, he died. He was, this is why I'm not a comedian by the way.

Speaker 5:          01:20:48       No, you can't. I couldn't get upset at you for seeing the healthy living. It's obviously not healthier. He had a lot of, a lot of drug problems, but he wound up dying because of it. And um, but just seeing him trying to calm down by drinking, pounding this 40 ounce of beer, just try to get the alcohol into his bloodstream to just alleviate the, the crazy heartbeat that he had going on. That's where the dea and stuff like that is fucking up also, is if they've betrayed the trust of young people by lying to them about marijuana. So as a result, there are probably people out there who are like, well, maybe not that bad. Exactly. Maybe crack cocaine is not that bad because they completely lied to a some marijuana and I remember as a kid in middle school they had a cop come to our classroom and give us the whole day or breakdown and he had a suitcase filled with like fake versions of drugs and what they look like.

Speaker 5:          01:21:38       And I was thinking like, even as a kid I was like, how ridiculous is this? Now I'm an expert on all these drugs. Look like before I didn't know shit about half these things down, like practically a drug dealer based on this fucking infomercial. Like here's all the stuff that you should never look for, don't look for this one. It comes in this kind of bag, you know? And I'm like, what is this? Some kind of weird propaganda. There's education and knowing what not to take as long as you're honest about it, as long as you go. Now this one is actually just the dried plant. It grows all over the contiguous United States. It's been used for thousands of years, by the way. You just said contiguous. I've never used that word ever. Have you ever used contiguous? Yeah, of course. No, it's a good word. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:22:15       So I, uh, I read a lot of Shit on my kindle and then certain words just get into my mind is a good one and I'm like, I'm going to use this next time. I feel like using it rocket contiguous. Hope you use it correctly anyway. So it's already being fact checked. You're right. You're right. You're absolutely right. It's that if they said that, if they're honest about the look, you shouldn't do this one because it's going to lower your motivation. At least stay away from it until you get into college or until you get a job or whatever it is that you need to get. You should avoid if you want to be as motivated as possible. If they said that, then I'm like, okay, then I'll listen to you when it comes to stay away from the crack cocaine because it will fuck up your life, which it will, but you don't trust that person. I have no trust what they say. Well, it also fucks up the relationship that people have to law enforcement. It fucks up the relationship that people have to people in positions of authority that you legitimately need to protect you in a civilized society and that's what the cops should

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       be. Being a cop should be an honorable position that's very difficult to acquire. It should be something that we really respect and we love and appreciate the people that are around us that are there to help us. If some shit goes wrong, if some bad people around, if some people are victimizing other people, some people are breaking the law. That should be a part of our society, but when they become a dea person and they're shooting someone's fucking dog, cause they got a plant growing in the house. I mean how many of those God damn videos you have to see for you realize there's a problem with the fact these cops think they could just break into someone's house and shoot the fucking dog for nothing. They shoot shoot dogs that are behind dog gates barking, little tiny dark. He just shoot them. They shoot them because they want to intimidate the fuck out of the people.

Speaker 3:          01:23:47       They want to let them know, look, I just shut your fucking dog. You're going to start crying and I'm going to get what I want, and it's part of the power trip. It's part of the thing and it's part of what makes people distrust cops and that's fucked. If cops didn't have to deal with these laws, if there wasn't laws that were unjust on the books, then this sort of behavior would never take place. If you couldn't do that to someone, you couldn't break down someone's door and and fucking shoot their dog. If you could only go and arrest people who are committing crimes, our whole attitude crimes have victimized people. Our whole attitude about law enforcement would change. It would make it better for them. You know? It would make it better for them. They will become like firefighters. It would become an integral part of our society that's absolutely necessary except for the people that are fucking committing the crime, which we don't want in the first place, but it has to be real crime.

Speaker 3:          01:24:35       It has to be crime and creates victims, victimless crimes or horse shit crimes against yourself, their bullshit. You can't stop a person from cutting off their own fucking finger. Did you know that? If you decided to go get a bolt cutter from fucking Home Depot, take it home and hack off one of your fingers. No one can fucking stop you. You go to the hospital and they say, what happened? I cut my finger off of the bolt cutter. They're not going to arrest you. They're gonna go, why'd you do that? You're like, I fucking hate that finger there. Go, all right, well, don't do that again. You idiot. You're going to die. You know you've got an infection. Take these antibiotics and get out of the hospital, but how come you can cut off your fucking finger? But if you see a guy who likes to smoke pot, you can arrest him.

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       You could arrest him for what? What's he doing? He's doing something to his body that you don't agree. Is that what it is? Because there's no victims. Here we're is. You're a victim. Is the smoke going into the air and polluting our modern discourse? Is it. Is it fucking taking paint off cars down the block? No, it's not doing a goddamn thing. There's no staff. There's no crime. There's no crime and dance where we have to make a distinction and the reason why, one of the reasons why that distinction is very difficult to make is because there's people that have made these laws and enforcing these laws. A business. There's a business not just in keeping prison guards in in work, but keeping prisons filled and keeping, making sure that prisons generate income from bringing prisoners so they make sure that laws are in place that absolutely ensure that they're going to have new people in there every year because people are going to keep breaking these laws because the laws that are ridiculous, the laws that have been in place since the beginning of the time and those laws, they they, they, they're about 30 percent of the people that are in prison.

Speaker 3:          01:26:13       That's what's so fucked up about it.

Speaker 6:          01:26:15       Do you think that these laws, these anti psychedelic and anti marijuana laws are actually like a form of societies immune system? Kind of going overboard? Like I think about how some of the most brilliant people seem to have some kind of interaction with drugs at some point in their lives, whether it be steve jobs with the acid trips or you know, pretty much any musician with weed or any writer with weed at median, with. Okay. Any comedian, it unlocks a lot of potential that otherwise wouldn't be there for people and it shows you the world in a different way. Especially if you do something that's even stronger like a psychedelic. It's showing you something. It's almost like root access to a computer where it gives you a lot more power. But for most people you don't want root access. You just want them to have their, you know, their web browser and that's it and you don't want them fucking stuff up. I wonder if society as a whole is to kind of unconscious thing that goes on is like, this is really powerful stuff, so we'll allow some people to have access to it, but we can't just let the whole society go. Timothy Leary, you know, tune in, tune out, whatever his thing was. Because what will have as a result is completely uncharted waters that we haven't been to before and there are people really afraid of that happening.

Speaker 3:          01:27:22       Well, I think if you have to look where these laws coming from, are the laws coming from really educated philosophers and scholars? Not so much the exempt. No, no. These laws are coming from people who are doing a lot of fearmongering. You remember all the shit that Ronald Reagan was saying back in the day. Well, it turns out that marijuana may be one of the most damaging drugs known to me. The most dangerous job. You know, it's, it's that kind of shit. Those are the people, these people like this and coulter Twat. Let's finish listening to this because it's so fucking ridiculous. Play it more.

Speaker 8:          01:27:58       How do you know what it was? My best friend, no, she's not. I doubt that a lot of friends, um, maybe bill Maher is going to still get their pod. They're probably self medicating, but the more people will take it and if it is made legal vastly more people will take it. Disaster for commerce. Commerce. That's hilarious. Contents are incapable of following simple instructions and getting the job done.

Speaker 6:          01:28:22       Piers Morgan's body language. He's like this fucking person that I have to interview a drag on the economy. He's awful too.

Speaker 8:          01:28:29       I was just fine. Great. What do you mean by pop? Was um, when I'm, I'm moved to a new place in California and there was a cool pool guy. I didn't, you know, I'd come back and it's four feet down and it's called covered with green mold and I called him up. He was a pothead. Oh, I was there.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       You know how silly that is? I want to talk about anecdotal evidence. She met a pool guy who was a pothead who didn't clean our pool. So therefore what a selfish con People Centered Company, $800 bottle of wine just talking about $800 bottles of wine and then she talks about how her pool couldn't do

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       his job because he was high on pot.

Speaker 8:          01:29:04       Let me try. Let me try and stop the stream of consciousness. Yeah. Anything done with a pothead. What we need to do. Everyone knows what a pod had. It doesn't mean it's not smoking pot one time. How much are you assuming a pothead takes enough so that it can be made fun of on TV promoting a narrative. It's heavy drinker, heavy smoker, no heavy smokers work all night and then die young, saving the social security system money and we for a commerce commercial purposes, for the purposes of the good of the country, we ought to encourage Americans to smoke like mad. They'd be incredibly productive.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       Well, you're seeing laser John. He's encouraging lung cancer. You're seeing right now is a human who's screaming for a psychedelic intervention. If we could get ann coulter into a jungle retreat in Peru and force feed Iowasca with one of those things that they use for fog wall when they stuffed goose filled with grain to make their liver fat and delicious. If we could do that with her with Iowasca, just pinched her nose and our mouth. Pinot. Just pin it together. Hold onto it, force it down.

Speaker 8:          01:30:11       Walmart.

Speaker 1:          01:30:12       Hold it in there and make sure your body absorbs it. No, throw up and then let this bitch go on a wild ride on the feathered snake and come back. She doesn't eat dick too. She needs Dick too, for sure. Sure. Well, you know what she needs. She needs Dick. That actually wants to fuck her. She probably can get some Dick, but it's probably a mess. They're both drunk and you know, he was breast mouse, some weird Fox News producer just on top of her wedding. Stinky feet was fucking slippery. Socks on. The whole thing is a mess. I'm sure. It's disgusting. She's gross. She's a gross human being and not just gross like with, you know, she, she's not an ugly woman. She's not my favorite, but her personality is gross. It's. It's just so insensitive and aggressive and ego maniacal like what what she's saying is so preposterous and so obviously so. Obviously trolling. That's what she's doing. Fucking done. She's the master troll the day. See the new Godzilla trailer out today a little bit more. This case was more things to yell and then we'll play that because that's so much more awesome.

Speaker 8:          01:31:12       It's not heavy drinkers. When the cat is out of the bed, you can put it back in. That was the problem, but here's the problem, but the issue is again, to pick up where I was in the middle of my sentence, but during prohibition, that isn't a big deal. Why do we treat it? Alcohol related disease, cirrhosis of the liver, accidents as a result of alcohol. One down precipitously. It will go up. We will have luck. This is how many fans we have. One that's just about enough that nobody has ever overdosed on cannabis. Did you know that they can perform daily functions. They're going to be on my tax bill. You the people. Can you accept that? People can overdose on too much. Everybody dies. Eventually

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       you just contradicted yourself. Eat dummy and do you encourage cigarette smoking on television. What

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       she's doing right there is just being a silly person, which she's doing right. There is a purposely trolling, which he's doing right there is just trying to get attention and holding onto an argument that doesn't have any basis in logical thinking. Her argument is just about her trying to get her point over. She's just a shitty example of a person who's allowed to talk. So that's what it is. You know you shouldn't be. You shouldn't be given that sort of a platform if that's the kind of thing that you do because it's so obvious. She's not a thinker. What she's doing is she has an ideology and she pushes that ideology at the expense of all the contradictory evidence. You know, no matter what she's. I mean, she's talking about fucking alcohol being okay. Cigarettes being okay, marijuana being back, they're going to be on my tax bill is her concern.

Speaker 3:          01:32:44       Well guess what, Hooker, I'm not on your tax bill. There you go. I smoked pot. It's a dumb thing to say, it's just the fucking Nancy grace thing. They're all lazy. Particular look at you fat. So are you. Are you a fucking maniac? Mountain climber is that you running 100 miles every morning. You're fucking lazy. You're lazy bitch. You're lazy. Fat Face Bitch. Okay? Patil, lazy dummies out there talking shit about pot. It's not pot and you know Ken pot make you lazy. Well, it can relax you and if there's. If you have a tendency to want to not do things, pot will definitely accept you. Accentuate that tendency, but being lazy is a state of mind. It's what you decide, the direction you decide to pursue your life. I'm, I am not lazy because of marijuana. I am more introspective and oftentimes I get more done because of marijuana because I have more interests. It's just we have these perceptions and we have these stereotypes that have been reinforced and movies and we have these ideas and we have these ideas that are coming from a person who clearly doesn't smoke pot. Clearly she's not eating pot cookies and exploring your conscience.

Speaker 6:          01:33:57       I don't believe in any kind of media laws, but I almost feel like there should be a law where if you're going to talk about a subject this big, you actually have to have firsthand experience, so if you're talking about marijuana is harmful, you must have actually used it yourself more than once before. You can talk about it in that manner. If you're talking about Bitcoin, you actually have to have used it at least once. If you're talking about anything. If you're talking about being unemployed, you have to have been unemployed at some point or at least interview somebody who's unemployed now and not just pontificate, which is what so many people do.

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       I agree to a certain extent. I think the marijuana thing is it's also troubling the format in which they're communicating in these goddamn formats, these television formats or so and I. I didn't realize it when I was younger, but now after four years of podcasting, I'm so aware of what the difference is and communicating like that and communicating like this. Like when you. When you do Jujitsu, like say if you're a really good at Jujitsu and you roll with someone who's just really strong, he wrote with a guy who was like a good athlete.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       It takes you a while to get them, but you're going to get them so it's going to take a while. Like if someone doesn't know Jujitsu but they're really strong, you might not be able to hold onto them. They might throw you off them, but eventually they're going to get tired of doing that because they're doing it the wrong way and you're going to get them. When Ann cultures on a Pierce Morgan show, she could say a bunch of crazy shit because she knows the commercials come in at seven minutes. She can start this ridiculous argument that's completely securitas. It doesn't have an ending to it, and he. There's, there's going to be an interruption, will be right back, and then they're going to cut to commercial and they're going to come back and she's going to babble some more so she can sprint. It's just like a fight.

Speaker 1:          01:35:31       We sprint in between rounds, sprint, and then in between rounds you relaxed and then you come back with some other fucking inane argument and the next round and that's what she's doing, but if you got her on a podcast for three hours, I would brian downing her. I would do exactly what I did with that guy. You just talked to them and allow them to express themselves until you reveal how ridiculous they are. Yeah. If she. If she were, if she were here, she wouldn't be able to do a intellectual hit and run where you throw out like this huge character attack against weed smokers and then it's over. Exactly. I would let her talk, let her talk. I have hours to kill. Let's go. Come on, get to it, and after awhile you're going to get tired. You're going to get tired. You get tired of saying nuts.

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       It's going to get tired of sprinting with nonsense and then slowly but surely we will compile facts and slowly but surely we will present you with examples of people who use it, who are healthy and who have benefited from it. And I'll tell you my own personal story, I benefit from it, and then we can compare and you can tell me if you'll you think that Eddie Bravo is lazy. You think that one of the best Jujitsu instructors in the country, one of the first American ever Tappa Gracie. You think he's lazy? Lazy. Oh, you think he's lazy. You don't just stop and think about all the comedians we know that smoke weed that fucking constantly travel across the country that constantly writing and performing are they lazy and now you're you're lazy thinking and in saying that you're lazy and if that's the type of discourse that you pursue, if that's what you're trying to do, that's what you're trying.

Speaker 1:          01:36:56       That's a lazy way of being a human being. That's the lazy way of operating and incredibly complex neural system. That's a lazy way of being a functioning human being who has given this incredible position of communicating with the world because you have responsibilities when you're communicating with the world and one of those responsibilities is to express yourself to the best of your abilities, to look at life through the. What are you doing? I'm sorry, express yourself to the best of your abilities to look at life through the most nuanced and objective perspective because you're. You're going to say some things are going to influence a lot of fucking people. How much have you looked at it when her case? Obviously not so fucking much. Her Pool Guy, she taught us the pool. The pool was green. Oh, you fucking poor, baby. You poor baby. Was Your Pool Green?

Speaker 1:          01:37:44       How do you go on? How would you go on? There's a lot of beautiful people that smoke marijuana, beautiful spiritually beautiful. Personality wise, there's a lot of lazy people that smoke marijuana. There's a lot of lazy people who don't smoke marijuana. There's a lot of lazy people who drink coffee. It's a tool like any other tool, it can be used or it can be abused. You know? It's like my old joke from one of my bits. You can build a house with marijuana. You know, you could, you could smoke pot and use it to design things, but it's just like a hammer. You could, you know, you could build a deck with a, with a hammer, you could hit nails with a hammer or you can hit yourself with a dick if you're fucking crazy. It doesn't mean that hammer should be illegal, right? You could design furniture on marijuana.

Speaker 1:          01:38:29       You could build a fucking airplane on marijuana. There's a lot of things you could do while you're on marijuana. He can write a novel on marijuana, which has been done many times. Even king wrote, almost all his shit was just a lot of coke to. It's probably a bad example, Stephen King on writing, whether it's a mixed example. I don't know. Yeah. Look, people should be able to do whatever they want to do as long as you're not hurting others. If you're taking marijuana and you wind up becoming a fucking rapist. If Marilyn, if there was, okay, let's not say marijuana with. There's a cactus flower that people found in New Mexico and for some reason that makes you a rapist. Like everybody takes, it becomes like a rape Zombie. Yeah. They should probably make that fucking thing illegal. Yeah. You know, you started eating people's faces in Miami.

Speaker 1:          01:39:07       That shy legal. Yeah. Well you know what's funny about that? That was what they started saying was marijuana. The guy was the Zombie that they said they tested him and he tested positive for marijuana. That was the only drug he didn't test positive for. Bath salts. It's with all the stories, but this is how piss poor the media is. And when you're giving out these five to seven minute blurbs on information, well why didn't test positive for bath salts? Because there's no test for bath salts. You fuckhead they don't have a test. That's interesting. So they're just making this shit up. But what does bath salts, what about salts with it? There could be a variety of different compounds. Storage, just a media term for this. Exactly what man drug will with these man drugs are, is you take an illegal drug, you alter it so that it's no longer illegal, but it's still as ridiculous effects on the human body and then you sell it as not for human consumption.

Speaker 1:          01:39:53       It's not just one simple formula. They don't just take math and add phosphorus to it. I mean there's a bunch of different versions of these bath salts, so if you're saying that you didn't test positive for back salts, you're right and you're wrong. You're right. He didn't test positive, but the reason is they don't have a test for it. So of course he didn't test positive for bath salts. You said a test to a lab. They're going to test for a bunch of different shit. They're going to look for, you know, cocaine. They're going to look for alcohol. They have. They have a spectrum that they look for things in. They're not. Unless you specifically tell them what kind of bath salts, they're not going to look for that. It's not going to be what you know. It's not going to come up with a check mark next to bath salts.

Speaker 1:          01:40:28       So they tried to blame it on marijuana. Say this guy smoked pot and eight guys face like, I doesn't happen sometimes. Sometimes I'm like, I want in and out, and then I went somebodies face. What they don't realize is how attractive they made. We'd after that because people go, I want the fucking Zombie. We'd I want that. We'd that made the duty to dude's face Zombie Kush. That guy might not be to be able to handle it because he's crazy homeless. Fuck, but if you give that Zombie face eating wheat to a regular dude, he had mad munchies. Yeah. He couldn't.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       Couldn't even take it anymore because get get this dummy off here and I say dummy. With all due respect, no need, no need to have ron anymore. It's. I just, I feel bad for her. I honestly do because I feel bad for the viewers. I think that's going out to people's homes. These toxins are being pumped into your living room. She's a middle aged woman. You know what I mean? She's not going to get any better. It's not gonna. Get any smarter, which, which is what she is. I feel bad if you, you know, you've lived your life and accumulated information and had life experiences and this is the result. This is who you are. That's a disaster. That's a attention seeking missile to a disaster that's destroying lives along the way with it's fucking shitty personality. It's just so unfortunate. It's unfortunate for her.

Speaker 3:          01:41:34       It's unfortunate for the people that listen and don't realize how ridiculous or opinions really are. When you look at the actual facts themselves, it's the anti anti marijuana rhetoric. It's just. It's so stupid. The. Yeah, there's. There's definitely problems with people using marijuana, but there's problems with people use toothpaste. There's problems with people using glue. They take glue, they sniff it and they go, fucking crazy. People are nuts, man. There's 7 billion of us on this planet and there's a certain percentage of us that can't handle anything. Why? Because they were raised poor because the race in a poor manner, shitty I should say, because their genetics are poor because they're. They have birth defects because there's environmental hazards because they have disease is because fill in the life experiences, fill in a traumatic childhood. Incidences fill it in, fill it in for why they're fucked up, but a human being is a very complex puzzle that doesn't always come together correctly.

Speaker 3:          01:42:29       It just doesn't. There's a lot of factors that have to do, you know, that have to fall into place to make a David Seaman to make a guy can come on a podcast and be articulate and express information and have all this stuff in his head. You have to have a lot of factors in place, not it doesn't always work out that way. It's one of the beautiful things about running across a guy like you or a cross and anyone who's got their shit together because it's not easy or you and your podcast just attracting a million listeners and building up something. You didn't do this with a network backing. It was just your own thing and it grew over time. We also did cool. Didn't do it, trying to do it. That's part of the, you know, we, when we had these discussions, there was nobody listening so we just expressed are our thoughts and it allows you a platform to explore, but these, these like five minute blurbs where people run on and start arguments on television just to try to get people to buy their book.

Speaker 3:          01:43:22       It's the silent movies, man. That's some old shit that doesn't work anymore. The world is complicated and a five minute conversation on a very complex issue that has a massive social impact. Massive, both positive and negative, like everything, like every fucking good thing in this life. Driving has a positive and negative effect. I am not going to stop driving. I like being able to get somewhere quicker than walking, but driving kills people. There's car accidents, you're breathing in brake dust. If you live in a fucking city, forget about the pollution from the engines. There's no free lunch. Everything has a plus and a minus, but it's our job as human beings to to have a balanced approach and here's what's not good. Suppressing and making something illegal that's beneficial to millions of people and if there's any lesson to be learned from prohibition, it's the rise of organized crime because when you turn regular people into criminals, the criminals are going to provide those regular people with drugs and it's going to be on taxed. Unregulated

Speaker 6:          01:44:26       definitely. And then they just corrupt the officials and the whole thing becomes its own little environment and it gets entrenched and that's what you have is now you have powerful cartels that want to keep it illegal so they continue to so they can continue to make money off of it.

Speaker 3:          01:44:39       Yeah. And I don't really hate and culture. I have nothing against that woman. I feel bad for her. I feel bad that she's that person now. I really do. I feel bad for anybody that's in that position because that's such an easy for a person who has experienced life through as much of an objective lens as you can and you see a person like that that's a. that's not a person who's at their best. That's not a person who has done a lot of soul searching, a lot of thinking and it's come to this really peaceful, loving conclusion. That's a silly person. That's silly. Person has to be themselves and live with their own

Speaker 6:          01:45:12       Mary's every night. That's not fun. Yeah, she's not that. She's not having a fun life when you're talking about how he lived in a fucked up world and people do crazy stuff and you know, things are mixed. Uh, I wrote this article the other day that a lot of my readers didn't like, but I think it's one of the better things I've ever written and it's where I take this angle where I'm like, what if President Obama is right about most of this stuff? You know, like he's doing a lot of stuff that is arguably not constitutional. However, there are 7 billion people on the planet. A lot of them are driven by hateful ideology and certain parts of the world. And in a nuclear age, it only takes one of them. It doesn't even take a nuke. It takes another nine slash 11. Like, I mean, I guess going from Ann Coulter did nine slash 11 is natural.

Speaker 6:          01:45:54       But, uh, I can start to see the other side of the whole argument. And I think you have to be able to do that if you're doing the kind of work that I do is I have to see where people, like General Keith Alexander are coming from, which is the argument that we can't, sorry that we're looking for your text messages that sucks Boohoo, but we're not going to allow another nine slash 11 to happen because we don't want to have 3000 innocent people die and have the economy crashed and have total chaos for the next five years. And so I can see things in that light. And I wrote this article coming from that place of, you know, he's kept us safe and I realized that's a total Bush era argument and it's the kind of thing that I normally despise. But you have to be willing to explore that and explore the fact that it's the year 2014 now, uh, he's been in office since January 2009. And you have these fear mongers and the alternative media who, people who I don't want to disc because I do their shows and they do mine. But uh, you know, people like Alex Jones, basically it's fucking 2014. Like if what you're saying is true, why are you not in a gulag somewhere? Why aren't you in a fucking dungeon tower being tortured by homeland security

Speaker 1:          01:46:58       for one thing, he's easily dismissed because he's so crazy. I mean, you could pull up a million videos of him screaming and ranting and raving and you just dismiss him right away.

Speaker 6:          01:47:06       But my, my point though is like Obama is not the boogeyman that he's been made out to be. I think that what he is, is somebody who's trying to do the best they can within an extremely fucked up and flawed and piece together system that is dealing with like 15 different entities at once. You know, like whenever the dea breaks in somebody's door, that's not because Obama. Obama's like sitting in the White House on his ipad and he's like, Oh yeah, let's go to this guy's house. Right? Like he's got other things on his mind and yet we link all this to Obama and we should instead be trying to modernize the whole fucking system so that Obama has less to do.

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       Well, I think there's a very good point in that and I agree with you on looking at the other perspective. I think that's very important and people are very reluctant to do that. People are very.

Speaker 6:          01:47:47       It's one of the hardest things to do was hard for me to write this article because I'm like, fuck, I'm like defending everything that I don't believe,

Speaker 1:          01:47:52       but you're not. You're exploring that idea and I think you should be allowed to explore an idea. I think it's important to be able to explore an idea and people on the left are people that are, you know, anti war or in rightly so. They would like reject that instantaneously. But I think that to get to know what you really have to explore it. I think to, to, to look at the, the holes in the argument, even to look at it from a defensive point of view, you have to explore it and look at it from their point of view to understand them. I think that I would agree with you in a lot of ways that Obama, Obama, who's, that Obama has one of the most thankless jobs ever and it's unbelievably fucked up situation to try to deal with however he's lied about things and I have issue with that. I have issue with the lying about the NSA collecting metadata like that. I mean, how long did you think that that was going to stay a lie? I mean that, that was gonna sit out there before people found out. I mean, people exposed to that was not true within days. And

Speaker 6:          01:48:51       there's a new one that's out today. I wrote down, don't go negative, but, uh, there's a new NSA snowden document that the NSA and the GCHQ, which is the British version of it. Uh, I guess the British government's NSA, pretty much. Uh, they have this whole a procedural thing for how to go after activists that they don't like and harass them using troll identities, like literally their slideshows, showing how NSA agents troll people they don't like online and destroy their credibility and reputation and this is shit that even a week ago to say this would be like kind of out there because like, sure, like maybe governments troll people, but you can't say with authority, like the US government and the British government or trolling people they don't like now we know that this is a fact and that's something that needs to be reined in because that's not, you're not paying for that because we're paying for this crazy district. We're paying for some antisocial sociopath's to get a paycheck every two weeks from the federal government to fucking do crazy stuff on the internet. It's so funny, man.

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       It's so funny. It's just hilarious that they've. I mean, think about what is the, that job. I want that job by the way. I want the lowest form of life on online troll. Yeah. And that's what, that's what the government does role. I mean, it's hilarious and it only works if you pay a attention, but you know, if there's enough people working for the government, they're trying to discredit you, I'm sure they could put a good dent in public perception of you, but I think that's, I would say that's not what you're supposed to be doing if you're a fucking government. Alright, you're supposed to be in a government is one of the things. It's sort of a lot of ways like what you shouldn't do when you argue with trolls online, like you shouldn't do that because you know, you just got to accept the fact that you're in an unusual position.

Speaker 5:          01:50:31       Well, the government's in an unusual position to Obama with that. He was basically getting trolled by Snowden for a little while. Like I was watching this and I was like, it's absolutely ridiculous for a US president to be lowering himself to the level of a 29 year old freelance contractor for some defense company. How is he. In what way was he going to. By addressing the issue and making it seem like, you know, snowden's the problem with it should've been is immediately the second this shit came out. If I were one of Obama's advisors, I would suggest just be honest with you, will be like, it looks like some stuff went overboard. There were some things that should not have been occurring. I'll put an end to it, will appoint a panel to look into it. It's not what America is about and we went overboard because we didn't want to see another nine slash 11 happened and so of course some programs crop up over time to keep you safe and some of the shit is unconstitutional.

Speaker 5:          01:51:20       We'll fix it. And most people, I'd say like 99 point nine, nine percent of people including myself, would have been like, you know what? Job Well done. You know, we don't need to fixate on this fucking thing, but Jones instead, it was like a manhunt. It's like the plane was forced to the ground somewhere and to search for snowden and it's been in the news for months. Like, what is this? It's ridiculous. Yeah. Well, it's also, what did he do that's so terrible. He released information about crimes. Yeah. I mean if you look at what is law, what is law in this country? Well, there are laws and there are precedents that have been set way back to when the founding fathers had no idea were ever going to have a fucking internet. They had certain laws that were in place in order to make sure that people's rights are protected and that the government doesn't get out.

Speaker 5:          01:52:04       I got a hand that law enforcement doesn't get out of hand because people who have ultimate power, it corrupts them. It's just. It always has. It's had since the beginning of time, whether it's a fucking security guard at a mall or whether it's the president of United States power is a corrupting thing and these laws in place, they circumvented those laws. They changed those laws. They pass things like the NDA. They pass things like the Patriot Act. They pass all these things to make laws that are in place to protect people's rights. Invalid. Make the fourth amendment invalid and so then they feel justified by doing what is essentially a crime. Well guy comes out and says, Hey, a crime is being committed on 300 million people

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       in this country and multiple millions worldwide by a group of Americans who didn't get a license to do this by any voting, by any court of public opinion. These are unelected officials. This is scholars, this is Bob Smith, and suburban Virginia is looking, looking through your emails potentially if they just have the power to do so, so because they have the power to do so. The acted on it and that's crime. That is a crime. We have laws. So what snowden did was calling him a trader is one of the most disgusting labels you could ever label. A guy who took his own life and sacrificed to safety and security in order to enlighten the millions of people that are crime is going on. I mean, he's a modern Paul revere times a million. I agree. I agree. And he had a nice life in Hawaii. He had the dancer girlfriend and he's making good money for a 29 year old.

Speaker 2:          01:53:39       Now he's under the fucking the crosshairs. He's in the cross hairs now. He didn't have to do that. He made a choice and he's definitely not an attention seeker. Don't think Putin's not hooking them up though. You think you're talking about with some Russian slowly Mowgli, Russian chicks, Russians. Chicks are probably way harder than that. Check. He was banging in Hawaii. He's probably got some evil Russian liver steel and chicks, the kind. You fuck them and you'd get all groggy and you wake up in a hostel. Yeah, we're in a tub filled with ice. I don't know. I mean, I, I don't know what's really going on with him, but uh, if I had to guess, I think they take care of him. I think he's probably. Okay. Well think about it. If, if there were like a, if it were a Russian snowden and he came to the US, we would totally hook him up.

Speaker 2:          01:54:24       We'd make them go into NASA. The US government would be singing his praises every day. It's kind of creepy when you realize that that does happen. They do steal like scientists and they steal like, oh, we're all competing with each other. Like the US is one of the major super powers and we're in this dystopian novel right now where everybody is spying on everybody else. We have satellites and uh, I think the US is the least evil of the superpowers by far and the most promising one, but we should still hold ourselves to the highest standard, but shouldn't it be like vicious about it? I think there's just a lot of incompetence. I think that's a lot of what leads to these evil decisions and behaviors, so things to think about how this stuff is doing their job and all this stuff is getting out these lame powerpoint slides.

Speaker 2:          01:55:02       It feels like something from the office, you know, like the bullet points are like go after the activists damage their credibility, bring it up a search for. I'm on dirt, that's the website. It's dirt. Some tech blog and one of their top articles right now is about the NSA thing. They have the actual slides. Oh No, you got to see some of these because it's so like, it's just the combination of evil and mundane. This, that is just weird, you know, because it's people making these things and people making these policies and it's just incredibly vicious stuff. That's so hilarious. It really is hilarious. It's, it's hilarious how incompetent they are and in a lot of ways it's almost like it's on purpose. It's like the whole thing is being

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       done on purpose. Maybe they're not incompetent. I was thinking about this too, how the government puts across this image like, oh, we're just a bunch of bumbling morons. We shut down the government because we couldn't agree to something. We don't know what's going on. And meanwhile you have the NSA has these protocols for harassing people were very smart at some level, like we know there. Those are the slides. It's so funny. Leak confidential information to companies, the press via blogs, etc. Post negative information on appropriate forums, appropriate forums, stopped deals, ruin business relationships. Isn't that set uP a honey trap? We'll get that set up. A honey trap. What are you going to do? It sounds like the stuff they did to assign a damaged credibility hook him up with a girl. Oh yeah. Well, what exactly did happen with the sausage? I mean, what for folks who don't realize he's not in, if you don't know juliana songs is, he's in the west, which embassy?

Speaker 5:          01:56:45       Some south american and some south american embassy I should know, but I forget. I should know too. Um, but he's not there because of what he did by leaking all that information. In fact, that's not really a crime that you could get a guy on. I mean it's, it's just, it's, it's not the same kind of crime. The reason why they've got him held hostage is because they say that he had secret or surprise sex with a woman, which means he had sex with her while they were wearing a comment. Condoms. She agreed to it. And then while they're in bed afterwards, I guess they were both naked and he stuck it in without a condom. He pulled the creeper switcheroo and that's surprised sex. I guess that's. It doesn't even sound like a real thing. Like how is that? What does that sound like?

Speaker 5:          01:57:26       A real gentle attention. I mean like how does that require being on the books? Surprise. So I don't know man. It's, it's confusing as fuck that. That could actually be something that they could hold a guy in an embassy for. How many years now have been there for longer than a year? Long time. It's got to be kind of like trying to be in the same place. Oh, it's got to be brutal. It's probably, it probably drive you fucking crazy. It probably will. I probably really will drive you fucking crazy. That poor bastard. Okay. Stuck. He's stuck there and he probably will die there. They'll probably make sure he dies there. A vitamin that can be crazy if he's there like 20 years from now, 30 years from now. I think some president will probably like part time or something. You think so it would hopefully way, way, way in the future for that to president snowden and like 20, 45 months. Miley president miley cyrus president. mildly in two years or no, she's got to be what? Like 45 years old or something? Yeah. Got to be in your thirties, 36, isn't it? To be president, something like that. Somewhere I'm just hurts. It just hurts. It just hurts that. It's that transparent. It hurts that were that bad that after all these years of human civilization, all these years, since the printing press, all these years,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       since newspapers all these years, it's television now. All these years of the internet. It's still that transparent. It's still that

Speaker 6:          01:58:48       I gotta tell you though, like I've been thinking lately about seeing those images from Ukraine of all of these people. Bloody and they went total, uh, like completely off the civilization map. Just chaos burning stuff, brother against brother, like really dark shit over there. And uh, they threw out their president, I believe, and he's on the run or something. But it makes me wonder, like maybe some of this stuff that we sense as being really oppressive is necessary for society to just hold together. Like if we didn't have the occasional situation where the government comes down hard on somebody that things would just slowly disintegrate and we will get to a place where you walk into fedex and nobody wants to. Nobody wants to check you out because there's not enough of thIs kind of cohesive societal thing.

Speaker 1:          01:59:37       Well, that's sort of the thinking that there has to be a yin and a yang. there has to be a good and an evil. There has to be suppression and this desire to escape suppression in order to create momentum and energy and in order to to enthusiastically encouraged innovation, you have to be fighting against something. You have to be battling against them.

Speaker 6:          01:59:56       Yeah. It's almost like to discover freedom, you have to face a little bit of oppression.

Speaker 1:          02:00:00       Yeah. There's a lot of thinking behind that, that that's sort of the way the universe works and that there's hunters and then there's prey there. You know, there's lions and then there's gazelles and that. This is just sort of the way the world works in order for the gazelles to stay alive and keep reading. They have to realize a lion coming after them because if there was, you know, because gazelles could just hang out and live in one spot. They'd probably eat themselves silly. They'd fucked so much. There'd be too many of them. Then they'd all die of starvation. There would be no food left. I mean it's almost like you need both. You need a good and a bad and he did a night and a day. You need a winter and a summer. You need a whole fucking lot of different things to come into play.

Speaker 6:          02:00:35       Yeah, well that's what I'm starting to think is kind of evolving my views on this stuff because I think that government serves as a kind of immune system against shit like what happened in Ukraine and what's happening in parts of south America now where people are just losing it and you can't let that happen. You just can't, you know, because the results, you don't know where it ends and it seems like at least the example with Egypt, it ends in a bad place. You go from something that really sucks to something that's unimaginably worse and even more oppressive because you can only go from oppression, the chaos to more oppression. It's very rare what the United States did with our founding and the constitution and the bill of rights. These are very rare things that don't happen all that often.

Speaker 1:          02:01:15       Interesting that we don't realize we don't. We didn't observe and learn from what what, what did we try to escape and what did we pull off in trying to escape, but what we pulled off is the greatest startup civilization the world has ever known from. I mean, without a doubt, there's never been a time in human history where within 300 years less of a country being formed is become dominant superpower on earth, not not just in a roman sort of a way, not in a gang is con sort of a way, but in a truly global way. And now we find out is spying on everybody as well. Has missiles all over the world sending drones into places where they're not supposed to invade. So we send flying robots to do our dirty work for us. What mean it's the most insane dictatorship or the most insane government rather shouldn't say dictatorship. It kind of is, you know, it's the most insane. If you look at the rest of the world, they would think of us as, you know, dictators dominating them.

Speaker 6:          02:02:11       Well, we occupy a unique space. It's really the, you know, you read about this shit, the pox americana and all that stuff like we've imposed a worldwide piece. I realize I'm using the word peace even though there are people dying in certain areas, but it's essentially piece through force and we've established that and I don't want to say that that's all bad because I think it's provided a lot of stability and a lot of innovation for millions of people.

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       It's not all bad. Nothing is all bad, but there's a lot of bad. Right? But What I was going to say is that what we have become in this most insane empire ever was it was all born out of trying to escape suppression and we tried to establish these parameters that would avoid suppression in this place and those parameters allowed people to be free to do a lot of things that weren't able to do in other countries to freedom, set up homesteads and build houses and fucking farm and, and, and, and, and make cities that just don't exist anywhere in the fucking world. Why did New York city arise in, in America? I'd rub because it wasn't an another fucking country like us. When New York city was first formed, there was nothing like us and everybody flocked here from all over the fucking planet knowing that this is the free spot.

Speaker 1:          02:03:21       This is where my pArents, my parents family came from. They all came from Italy and they came from Ireland where it sucked and they got on boats. They didn't even know what the fuck was on the other end because there was no internet back then and they just fucking took a chance. And those gangster mother fuckers created this incredible place where they were trying to escape a shit life. So What do we do? We shut up this life too. We, we, we impose the same bullshit that we were scared of or they were scared of when they formed America. We just fucking ignore it. We ignore what, what our founding fathers warned us about and we think we're smarter than that. Well, you know, it benefits me if I take away the fourth amendment. So fuck you. I'm just some fat guy who eats meat and takes prozac. And I've decided I'm going to change the law.

Speaker 6:          02:04:06       Yeah, it is kind of funny that we've in some ways become what we run from. It's like that greek myth where the king is given the prophecy that uh, his son one day will grow up to kill him. And so he exiles his son to some distant land. And in so doing, he eventually assures his own death because they're in a battle or something and the sun kills his father not realizing that it's his father. And if he had actually just lived in the kingdom for his whole life, he of course would not kill his own dad, but it was that very action of to prevent his

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       fate that made it occur. Yeah, creating enemies, creating enemies out of fear, being afraid of people so you create an enemy and then you create someone that you should be afraid of, but now and now we're drawing people and creating new enemies. Not just droning people, but the latest revelation that we're not just droning people what we're using metadata to find out where their phones are and sending missiles to where their phones are. Especially when it's been absolutely shown that al qaeda and the taliban, they switched sim cards back and forth and move them around all the time so that people can't clock where the phone is connected. Is it connected to this? AlgerIa guy is connected to our halloween because who knows? It's a fucking sim cards floating around. Who knows who's got what, but they decide that it's okay to shoot missiles to where the phone is.

Speaker 1:          02:05:28       I mean, that's. That's some incredibly evil shit that's insanely evil. The idea that it's more important to kill this guy than it is to not kill all the innocent people around him. Wow. They probably turned on his camera though in there listening first, you know like, oh, nope. That's him. That's. I could hear his voice. Not according to the nsa documents. They don't have any of the cooperating evidence outside of the metadata. Wow. yeah. They just knew where the phone was. Sent a rocket there. She'll pull them. He's got a lot of these guys also use phones that you can take the. They don't have cash, they won't use phones that have batteries in them that you can't take out. Like they never use iphone or like htc ones. They use phones where you could always take the battery out because the nsa and you know, whatever, covering organizations fill in the blank, you know, the mossad plucking the [inaudible] or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       They all at this point in time, if you're a bad guy, they have the capability of listening into your phone calls. They also have the capability of turning on your cameras so they use specific phones that don't have that. Also you could remove batteries so they don't have a power source and they'll, you know, they'll, they'll cover their phone cameras, the front facing camera and all kinds of other shit too. So they, they, they work around all that kind of stuff. They're not, they're not stupid to what technology allows the enemy or their enemy to do, but you know, the metadata thing is just so crazy. So yeah, the idea that you found out where the phone is, so you send a missile to where that phone is. I mean, I could sort of kind of see if, you know, this was your, your, you know, it's godzilla and godzilla's phone is.

Speaker 1:          02:07:04       Yeah, yeah. I'd say just to, just to be sure to send a missile that way. I still have trouble believing that they're just killing people on the metadata because uh, I would like to think that there's somebody within these agencies who's like, wait a second, we got to actually have some kind of probable cause here before we end somebody's life. Yeah. It wOuld be nice to think that, but the issue is that you're dealing with people who are so accustomed to making decisions that cost people millions of lives. I mean, or you knoW, over course of time, millions of lives, thousands of lives, dozens of lives, whatever it is, the loss of life there are so accustomed to making those decisions. One of the things that came out of the, uh, the wikileaks, it was so disturbing was the collateral murder video where they were talking about shooting those missiles into the van and that there were children there and then the guy was like, fuck them. You know, it shouldn't have brought their kids. Remember that?

Speaker 6:          02:07:57       Yeah, I do. I that wiki leaks is another example where if they had just come out on day one and said, okay, this organization has a surface, some shit that is really unacceptable, we're going to investigate it. We're going to make sure it doesn't happen again. Thank you very much. That would have been the end of it. This whole thing with julian assange and the embassy and wiki leaks becoming this globally prominent, whatever it is, like this alternative media organization would not have happened at all if the us government on day one and just said, okay, thanks for bringing this stuff to our attention. It will not happen again. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:08:27       but they don't want it to not happen again. They wanted to continue happening, but they don't want to make sure that they

Speaker 6:          02:08:32       in the age of the internet, you can't just crack down on something like wiki leaks so that a lot of people noticing,

Speaker 1:          02:08:37       well now they know. I mean now they know. Now they know because of that and now they know because of snowden. I mean now they know, but it was uncharted territory, but the point I was making is, you know, saying that they wouldn't shoot missiles to where the metadata is because they're worried about innocent civilians and casualties. Will you clearly look at that video and you could say, at least in this certain circumstance, there is a very flippant attitude about the loss of collateralized collateral damage and it's children. They're talking about I shouldn't have brought their kids like, okay, really? Is that where we're at? We're the good guys and they shouldn't have brought their kids and that's, that's the attitude. Not all my god. Did we kill kids. There's not that attitude that it's pretty indigenized. It's unbelievably dehumanized and you want to talk about innocent.

Speaker 1:          02:09:21       Guess what? There's no one more innocent than children. They didn't choose to be there. They didn't choose to be born there. They didn't choose to have those parents that didn't choose to be led by their little tiny hands into the fucking car seat in the van. Where are you going to shoot with hellfire missiles because you, you thought a reporter was an assassin. You know, I mean, it's all a mistake and their attitude is, hey, we should have brought their kids. That leads me to believe that there are people out there in the world who are willing to shoot missiles to where the phone is.

Speaker 6:          02:09:48       Hmm. It's so weird that with Vietnam they went through all this stuff like the slow realization that we're maybe not supposed to be there and that innocent people are being killed and there's no purpose for this. like we came to that realization with Vietnam and it seems like a lot of the same stuff is happening now and we're going through the same bullshit where you have to listen to people on tv tell you that, you know, we got to support the troops. We can't question anything. We've already been there like that all happened in the Vietnam war and then eventually people just fell out of that narrative and they realized it was bullshit and now today it's still considered something where you can't just say that the wars are complete bullshit.

Speaker 1:          02:10:24       Well, the best story about all this or the most ridiculous but yet true is that both the Vietnam war and the Afghanistan war, a big part of what's going on, is it profiting familial drugs? I mean that was the heroin, right? Yeah. Well, heroin. I mean there was a big part of what was going on in Vietnam. It was a big part of the whole golden triangle. I mean, it was a big. The, the amount of money that was moved in heroin during the Vietnam era is documented. I mean, it's documented that there were soldiers that were involved, were profiting. What was that movie with denzel Washington where he, uh, he played a famous drug dealer that went to, uh, to China and was, he had a friend or one of his buddies was a Vietnam. I'm a soldier and they were, they were based on a true story about how uh, he became a big time drug dealer.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       American gangster. Yeah. That was it. Great fucking movie. I saw that movie. It was much like, what's going on in Afghanistan now? you, if you brought it up back then, hey, a big reason, a big motivation for the Vietnam war is a secret drug running organization. They were like, get out of here. You fucking crack pot. That's the same thing they say today, but today it's even more blatant in your face. When geraldo rivera is interviewing troops that are guarding poppy fields. Like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Right, right, right, right. What, what are you doing? Well, we need the information from these people and where the taliban is, so we're going to guard their poppy fields. Oh, okay. Okay. No one's making any money off this though, right? Yeah. The fuck outta here. Whoever it is that's profiting on whatever by whatever method, whatever avenue they're profiting, they find some sort of a Justification for it, but make no mistake about it.

Speaker 1:          02:12:07       Part of the motivation and why we're there is that money that has a factor. I don't know what factor it is. Is it more or less valuable than the trillions of dollars in minerals they have discovered? Is it more or less valuable than the natural gas at that Russia and the United States were duking it out over during the time of the mujahideen is, is it more or less? I don't know, but it's a factor. It's unquestionably a factor. The amount of heroin production in Afghanistan since he knew us occupation, is that like 90 percent or something fucking crazy through the roof. So this is just the unreported, a sister story. It's facts. I mean, these are facts, stone cold.

Speaker 6:          02:12:43       No, When I say unreported, not saying that this shit's not true. what I'm saying is like, this is the stuff that people don't see on fox and friends exactly is the poppy fields. Uh, it's kind of interesting that we watch fox or msnbc and some kind of academic. Uh, we'll talk about obama's performance is if obama is just this country, a politician who we can just sit there and review him, but he's really this incredibly powerful near emperor of what you just talked about, this technological and military empire. And so it's kind of absurd I think for us to still think that he's this constitutionally bound president. I mean, he's spying on all these people. We've got military actions all over the world. Like we need to consider the fact that we are not living in a pre nine slash 11 world anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:13:30       The, um, opium production,

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       um, it's ramped up 49 percent from 2012. It goes up all the time. It's just going up and up. It sounds like the business to be in. Yeah. It's way better than bitcoin right now. To bitcoin into poppy seeds, it's, it's, it's, it's incredible. If you look at, if just google the, uh, amount that heroin has, has jumped up 50. Oh my god, it's up by 50 percent in the last year. This is the most recent january of 2014. That's from newsweek. By the way. It's crazy that from news week their drug output is up 50 percent in the last year and since the. Since the american takeover, since american occupation, let me google that american occupation, it's full or that, that's some nutty number. Oh god. It's just so sad because it's so obvious. It's so in our face, you know? Do you think that the world getS better?

Speaker 2:          02:14:32       I think I asked you this last time, but from here I feel like thingS have to get better and they're already getting better. There are definitely better, but I think whAt we're getting at earlier is really important that the yin and the yang is almost necessary in order for things to get done. And it seems to be almost a natural part of the universe. I think this is the greatest time ever to be alive or really do, but I think every time was the greatest time ever to be alive at that time. You know, just not everywhere. If you live in africa right now, if you're in Liberia right now, it fucking socks is a sucky time to be alive. You know, if you live in Somalia and you have to be a pirate because all the europeans have dumped nuclear waSte off your shores and killed all the fish.

Speaker 2:          02:15:13       Very sucky time to be Alive. You're basically living in a mad max movie. You're living in the apocalypse here. A bunch of skinny guys on cat that fucking, that narcotic that they chew leaves to get amphetamine. Not ma'am. Now, now it's called cat k, h a t. It's a type of amphetamine that they, uh, they get from plants and they chew it. They get whacked out of their fucking mind and they get machine guns and they get in rowboats and they go full over fucking oil tankers and the worst combination of things ever. So worse combination of things ever. And you know, for them It's terrible time to be alive, but for us here in los angeles chilling, drinking fucking oh, coconut water, it's pretty nice. Can god's greatest weed sitting here using laptops and super powerful internet connection connected to a million people in the world.

Speaker 2:          02:16:01       It's awesome. It's an awesome time to be alive. It is. And I love, I love America and I love the internet and that's part of the reason why I'm so obsessed with all the shit I talk about is that these are really cool tools that we've put out into the world and it kind of pains me to see us fucking it up. Right? Like we created the internet and it's truly amazing. It's a game changer and no, now we've weaponized it. That's the phrase they use, you just showed. Yeah, where you're using it to harass innocent people and credit them. Ruined their business people. I am going to get thIs a million times now that I've talked about that, which is will aren't companies doing that aren't individuals trolling. And I'm like, it's really different when the government is using your tax dollars that you send them every year and they're using that to psychologically harass you or to harass the journalists that you listened to. That's really dIfferent from some fucking weirdo doing it are some greedy company doing because they want to just protect their little domain. But those companies that do do it, they're full of shit. You should avoid them. They're shitty if you, if you're, if you're saying negative

Speaker 1:          02:16:57       things about the competition and you're making them up and you're trolling and you're trying to kill their business, you're a shithead. You know what I mean? That's reality. You know? Um, there's a, a thing that's been going on with us with, uh, one of the guys that we've had on the podcast several times, guy named dave asprey, who I don't hate. I like the gUy, I think he's a good guy. I think he's flawed. Like a lot of human beings. I'm flawed as well, but he's exaggerated and said some things on the show that have turned out to bite us in the ass. And I sorta started investigating it because he started making claims about my friend tate's business. Tate started taping him. we're going to go into business together. Uh, for whatever reason they had a falling out. So tate decided to start selling his own coffee.

Speaker 1:          02:17:41       Dave asprey sells a bunch of things, sells a good products, good coffee, a bunch of other different health and nutrition products. Nothing wrong with what he's selling, but he started shooting on tate stuff. He called it inferior quality without any testing whatsoever. And then you also called it a knock off. He's talking about is mct oil that he sells. Well, here's the problem with that. Several problems. One problem being that dave asprey doesn't make mct oil. He buys it because a company that buy it, they buy and they sell it to a bunch of different companies. My friend larry used to be in the nutrition business and he was uh, he owned a company called nature's pure, a very good company. And he told me exactly how it all works and he told me how he buys from the same suppliers that all these other people buy from.

Speaker 1:          02:18:25       LIke there's, there's only a limited amount of suppliers that make vitamin d that make mct or they'll make all these different things. You buy it from them, you try to buy from the most reputable supplier and then you package it yourself and label it yourself. That's what dave does and that's what tate did too. And so dave was called tate stuff inferior without any testing whatsoever. That's a propensity for bullshitting and so I saw that and I was like, what the fuck is that man? you can't do that. You can't just say that because I know where you get your shit. I know the company that makes your stuff so you can't just say that his stuff is inferior. We don't know where he buys it. You don't know what testing is done. You don't know. In fact, I even went out of the way to make his is mct oil to try to improve what he thought dave was doing by selling it in glass bottles because he felt like plastic can leach.

Speaker 1:          02:19:06       It can leach chemicals. It's, it's, it's in the heat, like it's very conscientious the way you did it. What was not so conscientious with that, he kind of copied dave's business model. He copied dave's claims about mycotoxins and all these different things, so then he goes and tests dave's coffee and then test his coffee as well. Well, dave's coffee turns out to test positive for under threshold below threshold of two different mycotoxins means you're not going to affect you, it's not going to physically affect you, but his whole claim to fame was that there's a real issue with mycotoxins and coffee. He's developed a process that elIminates them. Every other coffee could be tainted. That was his number one thing. It's like classic government shit, create a problem and then offer a solution. So I know parrot his words not doing any research, you know, and having them on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:19:52       He's a very smart guy, very knowledgeable. It seems so. We repeat is his words about mycotoxins and coffee. So tate, when he does this test and finds out the dave stuff actually has mycotoxins and tate's, which has gone through none of this super secret process. He's just done the standard wet processing that all high level single source coffee companies do take, you know, he goes, well, what the fuck man, you know, this guy's shit has some mycotoxins mind doesn't like w w what exactly is going on here? So we sell his coffee at on it. We sell the bulletproof coffee or upgraded coffee, asprey's coughing. So we decided to test that and tate's and starbucks and some random coffee from whole foods. None of them test positive for mycotoxins. So it's an instant issue that's not really presents an issue, but we've been parenting it and, and saying that it becomes this huge thing saying that it's an issue saying that it's a huge health issue, but every coffee expert you read online thinks it's bullshit.

Speaker 1:          02:20:56       They all think it's bullshit. In fact, there's like scores that they have for coffee. They have scores like a really good coffee, like rusty's hawaiian that we started drinking. It's a really good stuff and it's scored like a 95. It's delicious coffee, you know? And in order to score high, they test your stuff from mold. Like they test it, they, they, they, you can't have moldy coffee and have a test high. So iT's, this is not an issue. This isn't an issue that was existing in the eighties. There's a pub med or article from 1980 about mycotoxins. So people aren't, people aren't dying or chopping other people's faces off a bunch of other shit about it. Like it causes coffee to be bitter. That's not the case. That's not true. So there's a lot of. So my point is this all started his, his whole downfall started because he was making false claims to try to eliminate competition.

Speaker 1:          02:21:46       he was doing exactly what we're seeing companies shouldn't do, shouldn't shit on someone to eliminate competition. Now if aspe came out and said, hey, you know, I think it's kind of fucked up to tate is basically copying my, my claims about mycotoxins, which by the way aren't true. Then he would have a point, but it would say, hey, you take the copy of my lies. You know? I mean that's basically what he would have to say because other than that, there's not really case. Other than that, it's just the the, the coffee equivalent of a root beer float, which is coffee with butter and mct oil, which then it turns out that wasn't even asked his idea. It was a guy named rob wolf. Another guy we've had on the podcast, one of the paleo gurus. He wrote about it in 2004,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       so it wasn't asked for idea. This idea had been out there. He collects these ideas and that's one of the things that rhonda patrick, who was on last week because a phd, she said that after he put some shit on his website from her scientific research with vitamin d and didn't accreditor, so there's a lot of that going on, man. A lot of people discrediting people sang shitty things about being a know. It all comes back to get that. It all comes back because if you're saying false claims about someone like that, if you're. If you're just randomly deciding that someone's stuff is shit, well then they get to test your stuff too, man, and if it turns out that your whole process is bullshit, that all this unnecessary nonsense or voodoo you're doing to your, your, your process to make sure that your stuff is better than everybody else's. It doesn't actually work is actually real and the problem doesn't actually exist.

Speaker 6:          02:23:14       Yeah. Then you shouldn't throw stones if you're in the glass. The glass house.

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       If he didn't do that, we would have never tested his coffee. We would have thought that it was probably still an issue. You can find things online about mycotoxins in coffee, been an issue, but apparently they figured it out in like the 19 eighties, this wet processing they figured out so you know, it puts us in a real bad position because we've said what this guy said, we repeated it on this podcast. I've repeated it and you know, it's not a bad product. Everything. He sells his good stuff. Don't make any mistake about it. It's not. You shouldn't, not by dave as that's not his style. Know that is a hawaiian roasters, that's a different one, or it's caveman. It was that cayman or hawaiian roasters, hawaiian roasters, which we have no affiliation with. Cave man is. My friend hates coffee. I have no business interest in that.

Speaker 3:          02:24:01       He's just my friend. Um, you know, I actually have a business interest in selling asprey's coffee because I own a piece of art and I sell it through on it, but I, you know, I have to be honest always about everything and I, I would have like, it would be profitable for me to not talk about this because we sell his coffee, but it's not ethical. Yeah. Meanwhile, it's good coffee. It's nothing wrong with it. People caffeinated, which is necessary. It's good. He, he, he buys very good coffee. He sells very good coffee. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. The other, the claims were unnecessary and the claims created a business and they created a model. They created this, this, this issue that doesn't seem to exist, but why did it all come out to light? What all came to light? Because there was unfair claims about someone that he thought was a competitor, I mean, and that's that country shit that the government is encouraging their employees to do, to discredit people is what discredits the government when something like that.

Speaker 6:          02:24:59       yeah. That's like the perfect way of expressing what I was trying to get at earlier. This idea of you're the fucking government and you're the us president. Uh, you don't, you can't, you can't lower yourself to this level where you're competing with snowden, with a back and forth. That should be. We fucked up where the government, we're going to correct it. Yes. Everybody would honor that. The same with wikileaks. The same with guantanamo bay, like we went overboard with some interrogation stuff. We detained some people against their rights, their basiC rights. We did this because we were panicked and we didn't want another nine slash 11 and now we'll take steps to correct it. And that's not what they're saying and that's not what they're doing. And that's really, I think all anybody wants to hear that, that kind of rhetoric from here on out, which is we recognize there's a problem. They've never fucking Said that, yes, obama as many positive things is that I can say about obama as I grow, to just learn more about the world and realize that he's not this evil dictator that info wars makes them out to be it's more complex. Picture. With thAt said, he still has not come out and said, it's clear at this point the nsa has done some stuff that is not within the bounds of our laws and we'll fix that and that's all he'd have to do and it'd be

Speaker 1:          02:26:06       close to the most people would demand. What does fix that mean? The most have locked about clamping down on it now and those people will be okay though. I think you're always gonna have this symbolism. no. Does that mean you would be okay

Speaker 6:          02:26:19       if I honestly believed that obama was fixing the problem in a meaningful way? I'd be okay with it because I'm very busy and I don't want to nitpick. Well, I'd rather see us move forward as a country and not continue to. You can go after anything until the end of time. There are some really big innovations ahead of us, I think where we might go into a big economic boom in the next few years. The bitcoin thing, even if bitcoin goes away, something very similar to it is going to take off and these are exciting things like we're on the verge of another big tech boom. Like we were in the nineties. We shouldn't get bogged down with all this petty bickering and all this hateful stuff and red vs blue and

Speaker 1:          02:26:54       petty at all. I think it's critical. I think it's a sign of the times and I think it's indicative of this new environment that we find ourselves in this new environment.

Speaker 6:          02:27:03       No, I don't mean the issues are petty. I mean the government back and forth is petty. It's very petty to like force an airplane to the ground to search for somebody. This is not, this is the most powerful government, the world you shouldn't behave like.

Speaker 1:          02:27:15       I agree with that. I absolutely agree with that. I. But I think what's going on, you know, whether we're talking about that, uh, the, the coffee thing or whether we're talking about the government thing or the talk about virtually anything is you can't expect to get away with business as usual because there's too much that gets exposed now because of the internet. I think that when you do evil shit and other people are aware of that evil shit and they could find out about that evil shit and put it online. You know, you got to expect that you can't, you can't keep these nsa workers silent because a lot of them are actual patriots. You know, they might have, they might have gotten a job a long time ago out of college working for the nsa, but they didn't do it because they wanted to be a bad guy. They didn't do it because they wanted to spy on their neighbor because their neighbor mike just think that the United States should get the fuck out of Afghanistan. You know, tHat's not why they did it. They did it because they wanted to keep people safe. There's a lot of people like that out there, so they find themselves a part of this genuinely dangerous organization that is genuinely violating constitutional rights and what do they do? They take chances. They take. What about that

Speaker 3:          02:28:21       william binney guy, that guy? That was the first a whistleblower. Way, way, way back in the day. That guy had some balls. That guy had some balls and he got away with it too because he was just predicting a future crime. He quit and then he predicted a future crime and then when the future crime actually came into manifestation, we can't. it manifested itself. That was like 10 years later. It's pretty incredible. When you stop and think about it. This guy called it and he quit the nsa after 2001 that has amazing. Fuck. That's amazing. He was the original was a whistleblower and nobody talks about that cat, that guy. I mean he. He's another fucking hero. What they're doing is what you're not supposed to do. You're not supposed to do it like that. You have an obligation. You're the top of the heap, but I think it's also an impossible job. I think trying to govern 300 million people is impossible and I think you'd get frustrated. It's where most come up with all these ways to keep these motherfuckers in check.

Speaker 6:          02:29:13       That's where my president obama may be right article comes from, is this realization that there are a lot of people and actually the best description of obama that I've heard, there's this pickup artists who put some of his videos on youtube and they're not all about pickup. A lot of them are just about like views on life. Who's this? Uh, this guy, oh, and cook. He actually lives in la, but I've never met him. And uh, I was watching this video where he was like, people aren't really prepared to hear the truth about obama, which is that he's kind of like a, a principal for this school known as the United States. So he's just trying to hold shit together and people don't want him to go up on the podium and say, look, you want more jobs? You've got to create some innovation because things are stagnant, like you've got to go out there and do it.

Speaker 6:          02:29:52       I can't just create things out of thin air and it's the same with national security stuff. He can't fix everything that people need to demand, you know, protections of their privacy's. It's not all on him. It has to be on the people and I think that we, for the most part, not uni, not red band, not most of the listeners, but in fucking lazy as a country, been focused on other stuff and now it's kind of coming back to bite us in the ass. So we have to decide like what's important to us, how far are we willing to trade off our basic rights in exchange for the guarantee of no more nine slash 11.

Speaker 3:          02:30:22       Yeah, I mean, or does that even work at all? And what should we concentrate on when we're trying to prevent another nine slash 11? What should we concentrate on? Should we concentrate on spying on americans or should we concentrate on a non intervention is an interventional foreign policy that doesn't cause people to get so fucking pissed off at us that they want to kill us. Should we concentrate on not shooting dji drones into apartment buildings because they have a fucking cell phone that we want to find the user

Speaker 6:          02:30:48       maybe focused on not giving easy, easy, uh, immigration rights to fucking Saudi Arabia when like all the nine slash 11 hijackers, I believe are from Saudi Arabia or many of them were.

Speaker 3:          02:30:57       There's got to be a bunch of different things that could be done. However, the problem is so gigantic. The world is so enormous. There are so many people. There's so many competing financial factors. There's so much shit going on that, for any one group to try to fix it and they don't even work together, which is so fucked up. The cia and the fbi don't work

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       together. And pete with each other, right? There's competition. WeLl, that's how it portrays got busted. They got busted because the fucking cia was getting investigated by the fbi. They investigated, portray as the fbi investigated, portrays the fucking head spook got spooked on. I mean that's how we got busted. That's how they found out about his affair. I think women is really how he got busted though. He allowed his personal life to take over. Yes. Granted, I know absolutely nothing about this case, but just from what little I know, it seems like that's not something that would have happened if he had remained 100 percent above board. That whole investigation that was set off by the fbi would have never happened because it was that woman in tampa, the socialite or whatever, who triggered the whole fucking unraveling thing and once you unleash those kinds of forces, I think they just keep digging until they.

Speaker 1:          02:32:05       Until they find something to crankin yeah. It's a cracking. You unleash that beast and you know, knowing where it'll end up and it ended up with him losing his job. Well, isn't it hilarious too that he lost his job because of pussy. He's the number one murderer in the country. I mean he's basically, that's what it is. He murders bad guys for the country. That's what a general is. I mean, you don't want to say no murder. Let's say killer. Let's say eliminator. Let's, let's sanitize it. He's, he's a warrior warrior. Let's say warrior. He's the head warrior. Just go back to like the conan the barbarian books, or watch a movie. What it kona and do he slayed and he fucked. That's what warriors do. They slay and they fuck. So we want these neutered warriors. We want these warriors that don't. Fuck. We want these, these people that are over there just shooting the heads off of people from a distance.

Speaker 1:          02:32:52       Watch their heads explode and they don't get any pussy. They're, they're stopping life on a regular basis, doing what? There's laWs against what the bible tells you you can't do, but the bible, you don't have to worry about the bible because you got a free pass from uncle sam. We've talked to god and god says it's okay to kill these folks as long as well. W, what if we went into Iraq on a false premise? God will forgive you. I know you kill those people for no reason, but hey, um, you didn't know any better, so it's all good. Well then who's to blame? No one's to blame because the government is essentially like a gigantic corporation that doesn't have real, sort of like one person that you could pin it to is like a lot of people and whatever, whatever. Don't worry about it dude.

Speaker 1:          02:33:30       I mean that's essentially what's going on. So that one guy who's the best general patraeus, he's the guy, there's the guy that whenever they went to the news and if there's something Afghanistan thing, they went to general patraeus, he can't get some pussy. Really? You're going to, you're going to hAte him because I look for his marriage vows aside. Of course his wife, she'd be upset if she didn't know. Of course, you know, if he lied about it. That's kind of something to take into consideration when you factor in his character, taken into consideration lightly when you really stop and think about how many warriors in the past have had harems and gingiss con fucked like every living human being in the year 12 slash 20. I mean w w, what are we pretending, pretending these warriors are we pretending that they're, you know, some strange barbie doll can gi joe, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       Oregon list thing that just fights for god, glory and country and doesn't have physical desires.

Speaker 6:          02:34:23       I was a awhile ago, I had this guy, David Brennan on my podcast and he was talking about how police and militaries and stuff, I've only been professional flight the last hundred and 20 years or something before that, they were just pretty much the enforcers for whoever owned the land. So if you were the feudal lord, you would have your own police force who had basically collect taxes and beat peasants and stuff. We've only expected police and soldiers to be pr professional for the past hundred years. So there's still kind of catching up because these are very old structures and you're using violence, so it's hard to. How do you mix? It's always kind of boggled my mind that cops will go from a fatal, like some kind of fatal confrontation where they have to take somebody down to 15 minutes later they're at starbucks getting another coffee. Like that's gotta be a weird fucking mind melt.

Speaker 3:          02:35:10       It's a, they have a massive disconnect and I think it may very well be that a lot of them were taking antidepressants. I know antidepressants in the military, incredibly common. It's one of the most prescribed medications for people that come back. They have ptsd and people have issues and depressant. Well, let's google that because, um, I read an article recently about antidepressants in the military and I don't remember the exact statistics, but it was in the military. It was pretty disturbing, but makes sense because they allow you to rationalize things in a way that you're not going to if you're not on that stuff. Yeah. Man. Antidepressants in the military. Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot. Man. Military prescribes antidepressants to growing army of soldiers. Okay. Military says at 12 percent of its combat personnel in Iraq and 17 percent serving in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants.

Speaker 3:          02:36:09       This is for 2008. I can only assume the numbers have gone up. Sure. It's increased since then. Of course it has. If they found out there's money in it, they look. That's the beautiful thing about being a corporation. You have to maximize your profits every year. Corporations just can't stay. Hey, we made x amount of money last year and we made the same this year, so we're doing really good guys. No, no. You have to continue to grow. They want that infinite growth paradigm that I'm Peter Joseph always goes on and on about and his documentaries. I mean, that's one of the most ridiculous aspects of corporations. One of the most ridiculous aspects of the economy is the infinite growth idea. The idea that you can just continue to get bigger and bigger every year until what you have all the money on the planet because that's where it goes. If every fucking corporation actually continued to grow and, and, and stayed alive for 100, 50, 350, a thousand years, whatever it takes, they should all have all the money in the world. I mean, what, what happens then? You can have infinite growth. It doeSn't make sense.

Speaker 6:          02:37:11       It's a monopoly game. Somebody ends up with all the pieces of paper by end,

Speaker 1:          02:37:15       right? So if you know, you got to think that if the pharmaceutical companies were making untold millions of dollars in having 12 percent of the soldiers in Iraq and 17 percent in Afghanistan in 2008, I mean, that was six years ago. So what Is it now? You know, it's probably pretty fucking crazy. Let's see. Any precedence in the military in 2014. Let's try that. Two thousand 14 and let's see what it says. Meanwhile, by the way, I'm just reading random blogs with a very quick and cursory google search with no vetting out whatsoever. So they might be all full of shit. But look, we don't even have to look into it. Whatever the numbers are, those are all abstract anyway. We know that It's a, it's people. People are definitely on it and that's kind of crazy that you, uh, you know, you take people and you put them in this terrible situation. He yanked them out of their lives and you've, you know, you send them over to these,

Speaker 6:          02:38:12       now they've got to kill people and then they come home and yeah, their wife is sleeping with somebody else or their girlfriend has left them and then they have the ptsd crack, crack down, can't deal with life anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:38:24       I know a dude who, um, they just recently shot a guy and I know he was having some ptsd issues. I don't know what the exact circumstances were. There was a car accident. Someone rear ended him and he wound up shooting some guy. Wow. Yeah. And I don't know. He's, you know, he hasn't gone to court yet about it. I know that they're trying to put together the case and try to figure out what the exact circumstances where the guy rear ended him. Who knows. The guy might've been crazy, who knows? And he might've really been defending himself. Who knows? I don't know, but that's an issue when people are used to killing people and people have been over there for a while. This guy, he did a tour more than one and then he also went back and did black water stuff. So without a doubt he's seen some shit.

Speaker 6:          02:39:06       You've seen dirty wars by now, right?

Speaker 1:          02:39:08       Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty disturbing the. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Um, I'm trying to get that guy on the podcast. I was actually watching summit last night. Jeremy scahill. Yeah. Um, I think, um, you know, we're, we're living in a strange time where a guy can make a documentary like that, you know, we're living in a strange time where you could talk about documentary like that for hours and hours. Your podcast or this product

Speaker 6:          02:39:29       as part of the. It's part of the reason I love America as we can always self correct. Yeah. We're not doing this podcast in a basement somewhere. Worried about the fucking syrian army storming in here and torturing us like they are just, if you're in a different part of the world, the only difference is you're in a different area. Yeah. You no longer have these rights and you gotta be careful. We thankfully don't have that and I want to, I want to see that remain. Obviously

Speaker 1:          02:39:50       I do too, and I think that it's not just America, it's a world and I think the idea of a country like America, I think ultimately the goal would be to have the whole world up to the same standard that we hold ourselves to and have a global community of people that are essentially, you could have the same rights everywhere you go and there's no oppressive north korean regime is. There's no places like Syria that's still hold. There's no places that

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       I think it's really shameful that we haven't gone in North Korea yet because I understand people are like, what can we do? We've got to do something. It's a humanitarian disaster like humanity basically watching another holocaust. Nobody wants to take the uh, nobody wants to take the loss on it because it's going to be messy and it's going to take time and money and probably going to lose some. There's going to be, well, South Korea is going to lose. That's our ally and that's a real issue because it's right there. But I don't think as a modern society, we can see all this shit on the internet. We can't just let them continue to kill people. The other, I think the other month he uh, his girlfriend, he just wiped out like all of her family or friends or some shit over some nonexistent. A sligHt.

Speaker 1:          02:40:52       Well, he executed his ex wife. Is that what it was? He executed his ex girlfriend and uh, he executed his uncle who is thinking about establishing a coo. And then he executed all of his uncle's family. He executed his uncle's sons who were innocent and they were 20 years old, but he knew that they would come back to get him one day. So he executed them. He executed everyone.

Speaker 2:          02:41:10       Meanwhile, the us government is fixated on guys like kim.com. why don't they go after this fucking guy in North Korea? very good point. Use the same kind of resources against somebody like that rather than someone who's a,

Speaker 1:          02:41:22       you know, I would be concerned with military operations because it's so close to South Korea and I think they've publicly stated that they would launch nukes at South Korea if there were ever invaded. We're, we're so clever. If there was some kind of resource we wanted in North Korea, we would find. We would find a diplomatic way to resolve it. Okay. But are we or are we not? I mean we have to decide are we retarded or we goofy fucks that do stupid shit that we could point out easily. Or are we these super clever geniuses that know how to circumvent any security systems? I think, I think halt the nukes. I think that we are a, we're convenient if the core

Speaker 2:          02:41:55       really smart, but we have all these layers of stupidity and not all of the layers are connected. Some of it is just stupidity. It's not there for any reason, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:42:03       I don't know. You know, I don't know what the answer is. I don't know what our reaL capabilities are and I probably shouldn't know since I'm not in the military, you know, I would just, I would love to be able to trust them wholeheartedly. I would love to, would love to be able to step back and say, hey, you know, if they're invading a country because that country is filled with fucking assholes and those assholes are going to kill innocent people worldwide. I would love that. I really would love that. And I'm not an anti military guy. I'm a realist. I'm a realist when it comes to human nature and I'm a realist when it comes to human history. If you look at the world, there's never been a time of peace ever in the entire world, ever from the time that we were shut out of the first monkey mama, until you know, fighting over a fucking deer leg or whatever the hell we were fighting over back then to today. There's never been one day on earth where no one died. There's never been one day on earth where no one dropped a rock on someone's head from the top of a cliff. There's never been one day on earth where people didn't fight to the death. It's always happened. it's always been a part of what we are and like the yin and the yang that we were discussing earlier that sort of exist in as a, a natural part of just life in the universe. There's this push and there's, this

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       does tie, goes in. The tide goes out. Bill o'reilly can't explain that. You can't explain that I'm in jesus his corner. But I think that there's, there's something to that. And there's something also to something that I harp on quite often, but I think it's an important point. We'd like to look at all the different sort of areas of the world where there's, what we call natural phenomenon or natural examples of strange behavior or observed behavior or, um, natural cycles of whether it's a weather patterns or whether it's, you know, whatever it is. We lOok at all these things as being very natural except for ourselves. For whatever reason, when it comes to human beings, we decided that because we're sentient, because we're, we have the ability to rationalize and think and communicate. We don't think what we do is natural when we think, well we do is just some, well, you know, as a society we have to be civilized and think things through and that might all be natural.

Speaker 3:          02:44:09       It wouldn't. We might be seeing with humanity is a really complicated version of what goes on in an anthill will we might be seeing. It's just some really natural behavior that's just on some next level, fractal shit. It's just so uber complicated because there's so many of us and you're dealing in, you're factoring in information as well as the instincts to breed the instincts to dominate and have food and resources on top of all those other things. You're also dealing with communication. You're dealing with the ability to exchange information. Also the ability to enhance yourself with that exchanged information and alter perspectives. A wolf stays a wolf. It's whole life. You give a douchebag. Some mushrooms, he becomes a really introspective person. At least for a few hours. He'd become a yoga instructor, was enough times. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of people that changed because of experiences and information and, and, and, and just life, giving them something that forces them to examine the, the box that they put the world in life gives them something that they've, they've sort of been forced to sort of get a new perspective that doesn't happen in the animal world and that's why you have to add in and factor in all these variables and look at human beings and say it seems natural.

Speaker 3:          02:45:25       What we're doing seems natural. And I think that along with, you know, uh, bears male bears eating the young cubs to force the female to keep breeding. I mean all that stuff is natural too. It just, it's, it's disgusting and horrible to watch, but it's all natural. We're working it out, we're working it out. We are working it out. I really think we are. Um, but I'm, I'm confident about it. I'm confident about it because the effects in my own life of, of education. And when I say education, I mean formal. I mean, just reading things and being exposed to information and be exposed to wife experience, just doing this fucking podcast man, just talking to people like yourself, just having conversations with people and hashing things out and then seeing the reactions to these conversations that people have online where they join in. They started discussing things on twitter, discussing things on facebook. I've seen people you know, have conversations in person about things that have happened on the podcast. Well, hey, you know, I, I found out about this and then I started researching into this and then I changed my diet because of that and then this and that and this and that. It's one of the reasons why misinformation like the aspe thing so frustrating and it really pisses me off because it's in. It's in the wrong spirit of this thing. It's in the wrong spirit of what we're trying to.

Speaker 5:          02:46:39       You do? Yeah. You shouldn't have a scarcity mindset. Everybody. Coffee's a fucking huge market. Everybody can have a piece. Well, famine thinking doesn't have any logic attached to it. Fam and thinking is just. It is what it is. I got to piss again. Powerful piss again. Well, we're going to play the godzilla trailer is something about it. It's delicious by the way.

Speaker 3:          02:46:57       Stock and cto eIther. They're just nice people. We like them to play the godzilla trailer because it looks dope as fuck. And bryan cranston from breaking bad is a fucking star.

Speaker 5:          02:47:06       It's gonna be epic. God damn, this looks good. I want to talk to somebody in charge. You're not fooling anybody when you say that. What happened was a natural disaster. You're lying. It was not an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon because what's really happening is that you're hiding something out, by the way, is the greatest promoted back to the stove ever had been so good at releasing shit. Slowly

Speaker 9:          02:47:55       pop It right up on the ocean.

Speaker 5:          02:48:03       If you're listening and watching,

Speaker 9:          02:48:08       you're seeing a bunch of cool shit. Your tests in the pacific.

Speaker 5:          02:48:28       No idea what's coming.

Speaker 9:          02:48:33       They're so good about not showing you much to kill it. Control

Speaker 5:          02:48:58       and not the other way around. There's the arrogance of man, so godzilla is coming next as well. That would unite us. This motherfucker popped out of the ocean for sure.

Speaker 10:         02:49:13       This looks really good luck yet. Please god, don't let it suck.

Speaker 5:          02:49:22       Oh yeah, baby. My dick is rock hard and it is good disaster point right there. Fuck it is. I love a good monster movie. There's not enough. So thanks to Ronald Greene of cto, coconut water for keeping us with coconut water that made david seaman piss not once, but twice. And the three hour podcasts. I'm a kid times, man. It was a fun podcast, but yeah, this is fun. Um, uh, does anything that people need to know? Anything you've got going on your podcast is how they get it. David seaman, our itunes, itunes. Anything else that on stitcher as well? No, I'm not really promoting anything right now. So it's not on stitcher. Oh, it's on stitcher. Yellow. I just saved me like other projects. No, no, no, but it's on stitcher. It is available. It's just straight mp3 format as well, so they don't have to get it off of itunes.

Speaker 5:          02:50:08       Exactly. They want that. They can just google david seaman hour and it's like the first or second. Please don't make fun of his name. Okay. The kid grew up with david seaman. I like it. Now. It's one of those things that you're uncomfortable about at middle school because it's still so new to you as a 28 year old guy will turn into 28 next week. Like I'm kind of over the whole last name is [inaudible] thing like good for you. Whatever you know. And what's wrong with them? Nothing. The bedrock of human society makes humans, you know, it's like a cement. Whatever buildings. It's memorable, which I like. If your name was David Steele, no problem. What a steel makes still makes buildings. Everybody wants to come. Nothing wrong with come. Definitely. Because if your name was david seaman in your mouth, then we'd have an issue if you need to change.

Speaker 5:          02:50:54       My last name was david seaman in your mouth and you're a guy. Like if that was like the full name. Hi, my name is David Stevenson in your mouth. And I'm a guy. Yeah, I do a name change. I'd be like a smith and my parents are just fucking assholes. Uh, let's, let's change her last name, but dick in the ass when he. Kanye west, name is kidd north north. That's not too bad. I thought it was weird. Weird. It's annoying. It's egocentric. It's gross. He'll regret it when it's kid fucking susan gets older. Not that that's going to happen. Um, so the david seaman, our david seaman, our, the last guest was the ceo of a bitcoin exchange and I grilled him on whether it's good time to buy. So I'm totally hypocritical because I had never had a problem with moon unit zappa. If I didn't have a problem with moon unit zappa. Why do I care about northwest? I had apologized. Kanye. You're righT, man. Nothing wrong with northwest. That's good. If you will. I didn't have a problem. If you didn't apologize right there, he'd probably be tweeting you in a few hours with a obtain rogan. He's allowed to sit the man. He's the biggest rOck star fall. Anyway. If you're a geniuS, you have to acknowledge that you're a genius. Exactly. You have to. You're not a genius.
