Speaker 1:          00:00:00       And Morgan Masters are out there. I use one out, three, two, one boom. And we're live. We're just talking about target panic. Ladies and gentlemen. Shows people don't know about all this lake. Uh, uh, erectile dysfunction for entry. It's panic. Freak out it because you want that Arrow to go so bad. By the way. Thanks for having me on my pleasure. I understand from all the input I get from all of my intelligent friends that you deserve me, Huh? So I'm excited. We'll have a good time with your, your assistant reached out and said people reach out. She said, I think you'll have more in common with Ted. Then you realize that was her. That was her pitch. Truth, logic, common sense. Spirit, physics of, uh, the American dream. Perhaps controversial and misunderstood people. Oh yes. Boy. We're surrounded. Oh, maybe both of cluster. Fuck ringing. Any bells? Yes, indeed. So, uh, yeah. So target, panic. I got lucky in that a, I got hooked up with John Dudley early before I developed target. Panic is the master and he explained to me shot sequences. Yeah. Shot sequences. Yeah. And let's, let's make this available

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       universally to all of our podcast friends out there in life. The clusterfuck to omniscience is what we aspire to. A maximum level of awareness on all fronts. Our curfew or a welder or a podcast or a guitar player, a butcher, right? Maximum efficiency. I'm being the best that you can be, clear mind, clear conscience, true north compass in the world of archery because it does consume you. And here I am, 70 years clean and sober because I'm currently an forever consumed with the mystical flight of the era, which is the origins of Zen. The Japanese religion of not shooting an Arrow, not being an arrow, but being the path of your life. And if you use the gifts from God to the ultimate application of efficiency and effectiveness, you can put that fucking Arrow right, right. What you want it to, and the baggage that all humans have to deal with and it's most painfully manifested in the pursuit of archery is too many minds.

Speaker 2:          00:02:23       You can't think about it. If you got to think about playing Wang Dang sweet. Poon Tang ain't going to play it. It better just be you and unleash and with an Arrow because you want to let that Arrow go because you're. You're shooting an arrow. Archery, I need to put that out down there in that bullseye or on that pump station or that crease of the Buffalo, and so you want it to go because that's what you're here for is to let the Arrow go. So you got to tell yourself, you can't let the Arrow go. You have to shoot so many arrows throughout your life that no, no. Too many minds, subconscious physics, spirituality ingrained deep within your origins and aboriginal ancestry. There it is.

Speaker 2:          00:03:15       If ever there was an aim, small Ms. Small perfection. It's archery and let me, I don't mean to monologue here. Oh, this is so much of my life. I know. No matter what you do, and I've done this since the sixties when the hippies were trying to get me stone and I'm going, no, that's not what you want to do. What you want to do is get a bone arrow. Would you want to do is escape what you're trying to escape, the pressures, the pressures, fuck those pressures. You be the source of pressure, not the receiver of pressure, and my dad raised me. My Dad was a drill sergeant. God blessed that son of a bitch is awesome. I hated them. Discipline, discipline, discipline, discipline, especially at the archery range and so I learned archery and when I'm playing guitar and I'm playing all this outrageous, chuck berry, Bo Diddley, a little richard stuff and everybody's getting high and drunk and they're really great musicians and the more high in the more drunk they got.

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       They became less great musicians until the point where they weren't even musicians anymore and so I would escape that and I as 1112 and there was no hippies. It was beatniks and I'd get back to my little house in Redford on the Rouge River in Detroit and I get that little bone Arrow and I go down to skunk hallow and a river rat. And even as a stupid mushy brained idiot child, I was able to little the Longbow. No recurves yet. And you know, I could shoot a rat in the eye because I had no baggage yet. I haven't developed any social baggage and that has served me. So the many minds, many. I know. Mine's the baggage. Yeah. Too many miles. I think that that's a thing that people don't shoot arrows when you start talking about this, they don't really understand what you're saying. I know exactly what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       But for a lot of people, this is a very misunderstood subject, right? Yep. That did that, that this is a meditation. There's a meditation involved in the absolute meditation. You, it's out of body. The ultimate Arrow, like the ultimate guitar lick, I suspect a comedian on stage, which I qualify it. You can't be thinking of your routine. It's got a flow. I mean, I was in the presence of Sam Kinison for 50, 60 spontaneous performances and Robin Williams at the comedy store. And, and, and, uh, Richard Pryor, you see, remember I mentioned a moment ago, I've been on the mountain top with Bill Strop and the Broncos and Parnelli Jones taught me to raise. I played bass for Chuck Berry. And Bo Diddley, I mean I'm married, Mrs Nugent. I mean I've been to the peak of peaks available to mankind. I hunted with Fred fucking bear. When did you do that? I have five or six.

Speaker 2:          00:06:00       I met him. He was started the brand new archery shopping, grayling, Michigan. My Dad was already a follower before I was exploring to people who he is, people who are uninitiated. Powerful story. He's like the Richard Pryor of archery. I was expecting his afro to catch fire any moment. So I'm already into bows and arrows. I don't know who fred bear was. I really was just getting baptized by the Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, electronic guitar or g, and in that late forties, early fifties. It was a firestorm of defiance and rebellion musically manifested, but Roy, whether b was going beyond the 30 slash 30, which everybody used for deer hunting and it was a good hundred yard and for real marchmen real zen marksman could shoot a 30, 3,200 plus yards whether open sites or scope and marksmanship and sniper discipline was a powerful force in a hunting family and in all families.

Speaker 2:          00:06:57       Every family I knew, we all shot every weekend, pistols, shotguns, rifles, 20 twos, hunting, woodchucks and Freiberg, Pennsylvania with the target master Remington single shot bolt, 20 to 22 shorts, twenty five cents a box at the dry goods store. It's awesome. And with my dad taught me to shoot him in the eye. Aim Small Miss Small breathe site acquisition. You have a responsibility to kill that animal outright if you're going to utilize that precious gift of flesh and for body fluids and bone, you better kill him clean because you're a reasoning predator. You have a moral, intellectual and spiritual obligation to kill your dinner humanely and cleanly. Duh. And so that marksmanship routine was developing with ballistic Ted nugent, ballistically maximized firepower. And Roy stands for, I thought it said bad motherfucker, you know, that has a ring to it. Maybe that's maybe that's what it good. Alright. So Fred Threadbare, Fred Beck.

Speaker 2:          00:08:01       So Roy, whether be was extending long range marksmanship and developing the, the famous, whether it be magnums with more powder, more efficient burning powder. I'm better primers, better designed ballistic bullets that would cut air better and go flatter, longer, better trajectory and velocity, and so it was fun to shoot that deer or a bullseye at 100 yards. That takes a lot of trigger control and discipline, but now roy, whether it be was creating, whether it be magnums, the 300, whether it be magnum shout, 100, eight years, 80 grain, bullet it 32, 3,400 feet a second, which was unheard of, and so you could aim small, Ms. Small, and if you really got that really intricate, meticulous, triggered a smoothness, you could shoot thousand yards once you learn the trajectory of your gun. However, 1911, the last of the Yani Indians issue was discovered in Oroville. I can't believe I remember all this in Oroville, California, northern California, and there was a bounty on Indians back then.

Speaker 2:          00:09:07       You could shoot a man Indian and get 25 bucks. You shoot until 11. Yep. They had bounties on him instead of shooting this, Yani, this last Indian, they called the local sheriff and they took him into custody and they called, uh, some scientists. And uh, pellant theologists, I'm from California University by the name of our Saxton Pope, and Saxton pope came and studied egg as a, as a aboriginal last pope, Pope and young that's right. And then he contacted his buddy, art young, who also studied in that genre and they discovered ecg and they were fascinated by his stealthy awareness of the wilderness in his archery control, with his funny little style of shooting the bull with his thumb and getting close and doing an ice cold river bathing before the hunt to cleanse himself to be worthy of the beast. So Fred bear witnessed the film that Pope and young eventually made of them becoming consumed with the mystical flight of the Arrow.

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       Now this was in the twenties and thirties, and they put a newsreel out when all over the country and showed this newsreel of hunting with the bone Arrow by Saxton Pope in art, young shooting grizzly bears in Yosemite and going to Africa, filling lines full of arrows. They weren't really as good as he. She said they'd fling arrows. And these animals pretty relaxed, almost tame because they'd never been hunted like that before. And so fred bear come from Pennsylvania around that time to work at the palm oil company, building cabinets for the new radio. They just invented in the wood dashboards for the Ford Motor Company. And he was also making bows a handmade. You wouldn't, or osage orange bows in his little archery shop with nels grumbly. I can't believe I remembered Nell's grumbling one of the greatest boyers of all time. So my dad got the archery bug because Fred defied the trend of easier hunting, easier, long range.

Speaker 2:          00:11:16       You didn't have to be very stealthy issue to dear 500 yards. They don't even know you're there. I have to do is be a discipline Marchmen, which is a discipline and a great accomplishment unto itself. And it was a new challenge for long range ballistic capability. Will Pope and young and a handful, fred bear knows grumbly went and saw this newsreel of these guys, these doctors, these, uh, professors hunting all over the world with these handmade bows and fed was already into it. And he was, I'll be damn this, I didn't realize you could do that. And so now people after seeing the pope and young newsreel started asking Fred to make bows and it's spread. So we started the bear archery company, late twenties, early thirties, and he moved to grayling up in the northern part of Michigan with a wilderness was, and they had cut down all the trees.

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       So there was this new growth of ideal wildlife habitat because not many animals can live in an old growth forest and our tool, but you need low level escape sanctuary and browse that the animals can access. And so fred was now promoting our tree and Michigan won all the, uh, uh, national field archery championship championships along with an Marston. It's awesome. And so my dad was a follower because he'd come back from World War II and he needed that escape. He needed that cleansing to get away from that horror, which is why they never talked about it. And so we go up north every year, October first, the new gene family and the Ford station wagon. And I had my little bone Arrow with the suction cups, and I'd shoot stuffed animals off the couch, but my dad would walk the woods with his real bowl and we'd stop at this little, a brick shack that said bear archery.

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       And I had no idea. And so I was already into bows and arrows shooting all the time. I was obsessed. I was under the river every day. No baseball, no football, no hockey bows and arrows, bows, murals, critters. I think I had the songbird world slammed by the time I was eight. And, uh, and so now I'm meeting this tall, lanky gentleman named Fred Bear. It didn't register with me until I started seeing him on the cover of true magazine and sporting magazines and in life magazine with a Grizzly bear and an elephant and a tiger and a lion in the newsreels. And I'm going, I'm shooting river rats, which is so thrilling. I can't even describe it. And here's this long, lanky, tall, lanky guy that was building bows in this rustic, rustic shop in northern Michigan. On my way to my favorite thing in life, October, first opening day of archery season as a six, seven, eight year old boy and we'd have chocolate milk and Cherry Pie with this fred bear guy.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       Now it's registering. This is the Chuck Berry of bonding. This is it. This is the guy. So I became a namerd with him and he was kind to me and he'd show me stuff, but I got to hang out with them as I grew. By the time I was 16, we moved to Chicago was my dad got transferred, but I got to visit with Fred bear at least every other October. Never hunted with them and I'm now. I started amboy, dukes. I'd already had a great band when the battle of the bands in Michigan with the lawyers. We opened up for the supreme and the Bulb Romas at Cobo Hall. Wow. And so now I'm in Chicago shooting my boner all the time. Started the amboy dukes playing like a madman, graduated in 67, went back to Michigan that two years later and immediately went up to grading. We're now, there's this huge cathedral bear archery and fred bear is like that dude is like the sporting dude because he taught the long range marksman that there's an intimacy, there's a a better learning process and more lesson to not kill the animal, but to understand your relationship with the animal and to try to use those God given gifts.

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate the otherwise impenetrable defense system of game because they are sneaky, elusive crafty. God made them to get away from guitar players with sharp sticks and so this caught on because people go, you know, I killed my deer every year with my 30, 30 now with the 30 odd six and Roy Beth rather be long range. I wonder if I'm a bad ass enough to get close to a deer with a bow and arrow. So it caught on like wildfire and they made the first. Fred got the first legal season in Michigan, the Alagan state park on November first 19, 47.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       George Nichols, my buddy got the first legal buck and Michigan with a bone Arrow on that morning, and so I knew these are the guys I hang with. These were the founders. These were like you were. I was at the concord bridge of our tree and so fred had embraced me. It was real suspicious of the long haired Hippie looking, you know, rock and Maniac Motor City Madman, but all of his friends would not. No, he's not into drugs. He's in fact, he's anti-drug and he's always promoting our trash out my bone, Arizona state forever, like shoot flaming arrows at skulls and a big illegal. I think it was a felony, a big Turkey vulture I stuff, but it looked great. Backlit, you know, and I'd shoot that fucker off this amps at night. People didn't know whether to shit or go blind is this wild man screen, the bird lands, make it all this outrageous racket. I come up with a bow and Arrow and a flaming Arrow and blow up a Turkey vulture. What more do you want? And so fred got looked past the insanity of the fear factor of rock and roll, and he finally admitted to me, he said,

Speaker 2:          00:16:45       sporting good show. I go to Ted. All the young people, anybody under 30, all they want to know is if I know Ted nugent, because that was the first time they ever saw bone arrow. And they read my you my interviews about the the spirit, the cleansing of escaping, the insanity of whatever your job description might be. Mine being maniacal rock and roll. I need to shut the fuck up, take a deep breath, get my bone Arrow, let my guitars breed head back to the woods and live and remember who I am and what I'm here for. And I never killed a deer as little too uppity and we didn't know what we were doing back then. You were too uppity, you think? What do you mean? I just, I'm high energy.

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       So you had to be too loud. I mean, I could walk through. I learned from Fred Ed. I learned

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       to walk toe first and I learned to go anything you

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       instead of stepping over and to stay in the shadows so I knew the maneuvers, but coming out of a tour and playing 350 nights a year and then you get a couple of days after in November and you get that bone marrow. It's hard to go from that to total silence, but you know what? I've mastered it. I know yet. Finally. I mean I did, but then you might take a long time by the sixties. I don't know about masters. You'll never master it, but I've mastered transition. What do you say when people. Like. One of the arguments about hunting that people bring up is why would you use a bow and arrow bone is not as effective if you wanted to kill somebody issues at gun. There's people that don't hunt that think that hunting should only be one thing and it should only be killing the animal from me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       Whereas I think that someone who hunts definitely kills the animal from me. There's more. There's more to the whole thing. Have you ever seen me expound on that fun sport meet trophy. You can't hunt without having fun or you won't do it. It's fun to challenge yourself. It's fun to get up and some people will have a problem with that word. They can kiss my ass if it wasn't fun. None of us would do it. I understand your, your your take on it. They can kicks kiss your ass, but you. It means something to you. It's not as simple as like, fuck you. This is just how I'm going to do it. Deep Fun is being the greatest basketball. Three point shooter. Isn't that fun? Must be discipline. He will, but it's. It's always fun. It's because it's invigorating and the bow hunting is more invigorated because it's so difficult.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       Borderline impossible, fun sport it. Why? I don't think sport hunting is good. You shouldn't have sport. How can you hunt without sport, but don't you think that there's just too many of these words are poisoned. There's like trophy hunting. Can't hunt without a trophy. You know what I have on my wall in my northern cabin? You're going to. You already are inclined to love me, but now you're really going to. You're going to fuck me right here on the show. That's not loved. Well, it's a metaphorically speaking is for some of my buddies. Anyhow, so on the wall of my cabin in northern Michigan is my first kill. November 15th, 19, 69. My Dad's priest. Sixty seven months. Fuck button. Buck. Do you hear the story? Yeah, and I took it to the taxidermist and I said I want this mind what he said here to mount this, but button button.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       Buck is a font of the year, but it has little buttons on his forehead which is illegal deer with a doe tag. And I had that year and I said, it's a buck feel. You have to feel on the to make sure it is a buck is it's such a little guy and it's illegal dear, and it's a delicious deer. The deer, the year is a fond. That's why we have this hunting season in the fall because now they're independent. They're not there had been weaned. They're, they're independent animals. In fact, the, the button bucks are there assets get kicked by their mother to throw him out of the herd and get the hell out of the way for more breeding, which is what I do. And uh, and so I have that button, buck mounted. Well, who's going to tell me that's not a trophy?

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       The, the, the, the experiences, the memories, the clothes, the bullets, the day, the sunrise, the crows, the sandhill cranes, the birds, the movement, the anticipation. And I got backstraps. I had fun. Ultimate discipline, challenge, sport, ultimate meet, ultimate protein. The purest, most organic before it was even hip. And if you could I dare you to tell me that button. Buck is not a trophy. I got, I have woodchucks mounted. I got a shot. I would chuck in the eye with my grandson when I have, I have squirrels. Mount. He's always a trophy mounts. Squirrels. The squirrels are, um, you know, when you, when you first start out and you killed that first squirrel. That's exciting stuff. It's, it's, it's always put a squirrel that you're mounted on a, on a limb at the, in the cabin along with Rocco and my son out here is first one we'd duck that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       He got very, uh, with much effort and we have that would duck mounted. There's a, there's a love affair with our instinctual stewardship duties to the wildlife to harvest the surplus, to make room for next spring's productivity because there's going to be more animals, but there's not going to be more habitat. Hence sustain yield successful wildlife management model. That is so perfect. It defies criticism. Unless your alliance sack of Shit. Have you ever had to have a reasonable conversation with someone who's anti hunting? Do you ever like sat down? Yeah, often. Absolutely. And to the man and woman, I mean adamant Vegan until I explained to them, well vague and I like that Vegan, a Vegan, whatever is in Vegan. I can't even pronounce it much less really comes out of your mouth. Figure it out. So stupid. My, by the way, my son Rocco, who I love beyond description Vegan.

Speaker 2:          00:22:43       No. Yes, he has. He needs to eat more when he's asleep. I try to shove up backstrap up his ass, but he's got more muscles that I do. Anyhow. My point is, is that how that. How did he become Vegan? He hasn't died yet. He has a digest. He has a great hunter. He doesn't like to hunt anymore. He's decided not to. He's killed. Great dear. Great Hogs. I've seen them on your TV. Shit. Ducks. Yeah. He's a great hunter, but he does. He decided he does not want to take part in the harvest. I respect it completely, but if you. If you really want to kill the most things, be a vegan because the farmers who protect your beans kill everything. I kill one animal per arrow. In order to grow Tofu, you have to kill every ground. Squirrel, every role, every shoe, every snake, every turtle, every frog, every bird, every rabbit, anything that gets in that bean field, I'm either going to plow and dismember, which is

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       why the corrosion, the seagulls follow the, the combines. It combines every year, and then if anything does survive. My first slaughter, I'm going to come in with man's Santa when poisoned the shit out of everything so you can have a tofu salad and not be responsible for any death. Fuck you. That's a really good point and it has to have a lot of people ignore and avoid because it's. It's uncomfortable, isn't life full of uncomfort and thing and you shouldn't be uncomfortable to kill. Game to feed mankind is perfect to kill cows and pigs to feed mankind. It's the system is often less than perfect, but until someone comes up with a better system, I salute and genuflect at the altar of farmers and ranchers and people who kill animals to sustain my fellow man. I agree with you. I think you and I would probably both disagree with factory farming when you see animals stuffed into pitches, but we have come up with a better system.

Speaker 3:          00:24:46       I killed a lot of deer and I. I feed more people than any. Any hunter ever. I killed so many much game of years. I have to. I have to hire sharp shooters. I guy. I killed the animals on my beautiful swamp and Michigan and my Texas property that have to die. They have to get out of there to make room for the next year's funds, so I've soup kitchens, homeless. Yeah. I literally give tons and I'm a sweetheart, but I'm not an idiot. I keep the backstraps, but I give tons of venison to soup kitchens and homeless shelters and veterans. We make jerky and send it over to the troops overseas. I mean I have to adjust my halo or just to get in the room. So what I do is literally perfect. Well the problem is what you do. Everybody can do like everybody's not going to have.

Speaker 3:          00:25:32       You're kind of warn people could though. More people could. Yes. Well you would definitely. I know the hunters for the hungry distributed a ton of $250. Two hundred $50 million Joe. Two hundred and $50 million meals every year. A venison in. There are people that would ban that. Shame on you? Well, I do. I just think there's a lot of films and a lot of documentaries that portray veganism is being this perfect way of living that doesn't have any death or any habitat loss associated with it, and then they look at the extreme of mediating, which is the worst aspects of it. Factory farming. Some of these disgusting pig farms, chicken, disgusting, horrible, horrifying. The upgrade goes on because more alarms have been sounded not by paid and not by the humane society of the United States. They're just scam artist by people who are coming to realize that we do not only have a responsibility to kill critters, to feed mankind, but it can be done in an environmentally beneficial way.

Speaker 3:          00:26:36       I mean, if you watch my great late friend Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew Zimmern on the travel channel, you watch their shows and the emphasis on environmentally friendly productivity. More and more organic farming. More and more conscientious waste dispersal, whether it's, you know, pig guts and a read we utilize. Those are in Las Vegas. They get all this wasted food and they feed the pigs so it's good food going in. The port tastes better, so there is upgrade taking place and here's the ultimate inescapable fact of upgrade environmentalist environmentalism. When I was grown up, Joe Lake Erie would catch fire because of the pollution. It wasn't. Environmentalist are greenies that sounded the alarm. It was the duck hunters that said, you're polluting this area so bad. There's no ducks. There's no wild salary. There's no wall eyes, there's no fish, there's no muskrats for the trappers. Hunters, fishermen and trappers have sounded the alarm more often than not, about environmental irresponsibility and now lake Erie, they would spontaneously combust when I was growing up, is now the number one walleye and small mouth bass fishery in the world and it's still, we're still producing and still got the industrial revolution going on there.

Speaker 3:          00:27:51       But conscientious, higher responsible level of awareness is spreading like wildfire across the country. And I believe that there's no mutual exclusivity whatsoever to productivity and environmental responsibility. I believe that they both benefit each other. And I've got so many, um, unlimited examples where that worked from farms. It mean people who live downwind of a pink pig farmers are going to be the biggest squawker is rightly so. Yeah. And, and so I see a lot of upgrade going on, more organic, more conscientious, less waste. It's not, um, it's not as a regular operating procedures. That should be. But I see upgrade. I see. I think you're right. And I think that the, the thought process behind all these people that are upset about factory farming people even that go Vegan, the thought process behind it is in the right place. I just think there's a lot of misguided energy there because they don't really understand where the food is coming from.

Speaker 3:          00:28:50       They don't understand large scale agriculture that understand when you. And a lot of large scale agriculture is to grow food to feed animals that essential. Yeah. Yeah. But it's also wheat and is also a lot of grain that people consume and that displaces thousands and thousands of acres of animals. And the process is not a clean process. It's not clean in terms of there's no death, there's no harm, it's cruelty free. This crazy as if you can possibly go through a day without having blood on your hands. Do you drive on the highways? Does any of your sustenance come on the highways? Because billions of animals are slaughtered on the highways every day and if you are on planet earth, part of that blood is on your hands. You got to be. Who doesn't know this? He was, not to admit this, but again, I see an upgrade in level of awareness and responsibility, but the charge began in the hunting, fishing and trapping community because where does, where does quality, air, soil, and water come from?

Speaker 3:          00:29:54       I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife habitat out of the people that are out there every day to recognize it in more and more. You know, I used to, I still get death threats because I am murder innocent animals, but now I get those too. What the hell? So it's just so absurd. But I think their heart like right place, they just don't know what they're talking about. They're just haters. They're just a bit of that. In 2018, do you not acknowledged barbecue? How in 2018 do you not acknowledge there's a few dead Turkeys on Thanksgiving? What do you mean you going to be brain dead? I think they're so consumed with hate that they fight. Ignorance is acceptable. I'm a grownup. When I go to the indy 500, I couldn't turn a cogsworth. I don't. I'm ignorant about cogsworth. Ignorance is acceptable because you can remedy it with knowledge and research.

Speaker 3:          00:30:45       Stupidity is when you guard your ignorance, if you think that were murdering innocent animals to feed our families with the purest protein available to mankind. Balancing the herds with more deer, more elk, more bison, more turkeys, more waterfowl, more cougars, more bears than ever in recorded history except for the bison, but we're way back. We have as many bisons we can sustain in North America. A lot of the native American tribes are desperate to get more harvested in an efficient and responsible manner. So wildlife is thriving because hunters implemented regulations for sustained yield. How many ducks can we kill? How many will they reproduce? Where's their habitat determines their reproduction. We must safeguard that Delta waterfowl, ducks unlimited, but see, this information is universally available, but the fake news, academia, Hollywood, and half of our government is stone cold, obsessed with political correctness and denial. Yeah, so I do what I do and our spirit of the wild showed been number one.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       An outer challenges is 29 years now. Wow. I'm getting old because we say it like it is. We don't play around fun sport. Meet trophy, sacred beast. Prayer for the wild things. Resource Stewardship, conservation wise, use. Walk the wild ground. Before you comment on the wild, grown the. Well this is what I'm talking about when you were talking about that last Indian, but they found the guy who started river study issue. Okay. I will write it down. What's this? How do you suppose I s h I. You have to learn this. I'm going to send you a bunch of stuff. I'm going to get your contacts and I'm going to send you stuff. It will expand your horizons like you didn't know was available. The. The history of modern bowhunting at the hands of Fred. Bear and and Saxton Pope and young and

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       the families that wanted to get closer to game, not necessarily kill because 90 percent of the time you don't kill squat with a bone Arrow, but when you do, it's because you dedicate yourself to a higher reasoning level, Predator awareness and you put your gifts from God to the maximum efficiency and again, that's welding and carpentry, but ultimately you're going to kill some. You better kill it, clean and being human and failing overall to be perfect. You can be perfect and put that Arrow when you learned. Read the wild signals, the, the, the, the attitude, and the the, the bird indicators. When the deals come in, you use the light, the wind, the camel, stealthy movements, silence and learned time that shot. My average deer dies in five seconds. The the top of the heart taken off. Both lungs are penetrated at deer falls, asleep on his feet and there's never been a beef steak ever had it.

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       So good. The also, there's a connection to what you're doing that's different than almost any other connection to food. I mean, the only thing that's reasonably close and it's pretty far off is when you grow it yourself, so if you grow your own vegetables, you get a connection to that food, but absolutely it's not the same connection as you get. No, because you're just going to send an Arrow through an animal. You look in his eyes, you look in that size, but also the, you know how difficult it is and when you pull it off, there's this powerful connection between you and that animal. You earn and you earn burn and when you eat it, you feel that you earned it. I'm telling you way out of it. When Anthony Bourdain came to my place, he was still a little squeamish with killer stuff. Even though he ate dead stuff on every show and got his paycheck for me.

Speaker 2:          00:34:29       Dead stuff. I hunted with him. Yeah. Did Ya know it was greg manning. It was a great man. I'm terrible loss, terrible loss, and we talked about it and I, I shared my knowledge with them. I'm not, I don't have an opinion. It's an animal. It's dead. You either revered or you don't utilize it with respect or you pretend you didn't have anything to do with it. It's dead. You're eating it. You should have been closer to the system and the hunters, fishermen and trappers in this country still carry on the definitive physics of spirituality that the native and aboriginal peoples called the great spirit. Hence the spirit of the wild. The prayer for the wild things. We're in a weird place, ted, with cities, right? Right, right. You were. Yeah, but I mean you got lucky and that your father was interested in bowhunting and that it gave him an escape, which by the way, it gives a lot of veterans today.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       A lot of veterans and good friends of mine have finding the Lt great relief in bow hunting as a discipline after combat. Yeah, talking to a guy that's shared mini camp fires with those guys. It's a rare last night. Great transition for them. It's consuming. Fred bear uses the phrase coined the phrase, and I use it all the time. It cleanses the soul when you leave the pavement. When I leave the pavement and I make that transition from modern concrete jungle, hand to hand combat city guy, because that's where my rock and roll career is the ultimate, and you take that deep breath. You literally go back to the year one. I know there's a high we nearby and I know I can hear trucks off in the distance and the train whistle, which is kind of titillated unto itself, but when I get in my swamp and Michigan or my woodland, Texas to quote Jimi Hendrix and no live nowhere, I am the aborigine.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       It's me, my resources and the beast and it's a. it's a religious experience. It's the spirit of that natives called it the great spirit. Thethe considered the buffalo. They're brother and it is so consuming that I don't care what kind of stress you could be going through the ugliest divorce in the world and I have. You could be fighting against people who don't think that America should be first and you don't need secure borders and and you don't need to earn your own way. You're able bodied, but you want somebody else's income. It just crazy shit and all of a sudden I get out there and I'm telling you, Joe, it's perfect and I'm, I'm literally intoxicated. I'm, I'm drunk, I'm stoned trying to pick up all the signals and I do. I do a pretty good job. I've learned over the years because I need that so much to play my music like I play it, that it cleanses my soul and I've been contacted since the sixties with vets who have gone through just absolute torture in their military careers and when I get them at a campfire and we go out and sit before the sun comes up, I can't tell you how many times they've cried because it's, it's good.

Speaker 2:          00:37:55       Again, there was a great morning. I didn't have any stress, forgot all about that bullshit when I thought I heard the deer. Then when I saw the deer, it was perfect. So you've expressed that and I thank you for that because you're new to this sport and uh, for you to be an advocate and to articulate, you learn because you're already a mature man. When you entered it, I was a dirtball mushy brain kid, but thank God I learned about that spirit. I learned about the discipline. I learned about stewardship, callings, and responsibility course pounded by my dad. God bless him. I'm in my brothers, my sister. We all

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       are happy, healthy, successful, hardworking, funny, cocky, loving, giving people because of that discipline that revolved around my family hunting seasons or discipline is one of the big word that that was one of the really important aspects of it because I recognize the importance of discipline and always have pretty much my whole life. A as a martial artist especially. Yeah. Yeah. So I came into boat. We're ahead of the. You were ahead of the curve yet. When I recognized it, I was like, oh, I know what. This is a different thing. This is not what everybody thinks it is. And this is a, this is a spiritual experience because you were around the masters. Cameron Hanes, you had John Dudley on over now is one. It got me. He's a Michigan boy. Um, yeah. That's, uh, that they were good mentors for you. I got lucky. You got past the mistaken yet irresponsibly and dishonestly promoted aspect of the drunk and hill billy science shooter hunter.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       Well, that, that stereotype is so ridiculous. I mean, my friends like guys like Cameron Hanes, he's a Goddamn ultra marathon runner and I run 240 miles in a week and then you know, is on the mountains all fall long. Bad mofo. I'm glad he doesn't play guitar. Yeah, he's a bad motherfucker across the board, but he's. He's an incredibly disciplined. Gosh, this is his life. His and he. He'll tell everybody all that stuff that he does all the working out. That's so he can be at his best in the mountains as a bowhunter that he considers his true spiritual call and I got to tell you're sitting across from a guy and I'm not bragging, I'm just kind of sharing. You can brag to brag a little bit. Yeah, but it's. It's a celebration. I have been humbled and blessed beyond description to share campfires with more hunters than anybody you've ever met because I've been donating hunch for years.

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       I started, my son rides the fires. I guide hundreds of hunters every year. I don't take them all out to their stand, but we all get together at my Michigan Place, have 24 and a weekend, 20 and a weekend and it's a campfire. Get Down with uncle Ted playing guitar, but we shoot our bows, we shoot our guns, we set things up. A lot of them are newcomers. I got on my spirit wild ranch in Texas. I guide in New Brunswick and Ontario for kid rock into bowhunting. Yes, I did. I did. That was a great story. He hunted down. Remember that discipline word. We're talking about working on that, but his girlfriend is a killer. She is a killer. Gorgeous Gal, but audrey is a dangerous bull Hutton woman. I mean she always killing stuff. It's tough. She's addicted. I get. I get paced from her all the time and never from Bob. That's hilarious. She's awesome. I'll start sharing that stuff with your turn. You onto a higher level of appreciation of finance. Women with a sharp stick. This gal between my wife, Charmaine and Audrey, I'm telling

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       you. Yeah, but anyhow, the guys that you've hunted with, you're talking about great human beings, men of integrity and discipline and productivity and a drive to be in the asset column misunderstood because of movies. Very rarely I. I get it. I was about to say I shared campfires with lots of newcomers because they see it as rock and roll guy that they loved the music and we share the appreciation for my American rhythm and blues rock and roll Jihad, and so they want to try hunting and they come to my hunt with me or they make a donation for a military or children's charity and they've never hunted and I'd tell them what to buy and they show up and it's natty bumppo man who natty bumppo. No need to get into that. Okay, I'll write that down too, and now I'm going to sell.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       I'm going to send it to you. James Fenimore Cooper. He was a character in his last of Mohicans. It's a new hunter, natty Bumppo, like a novice of rookie. Anyhow, I get a lot of these people and you know, I've never met anybody at any of my campfires that wasn't honest, that wasn't friendly, wasn't successful to some degree, whether it's a teacher on a teacher salary, successful. There are teacher that's successful who care deeply about the wildlife and the wild grounds. So when you hear about wow, that drunk and bombs, just shooting everything, well, nobody has spent more time with more hunters than I have. I've never seen that even exists. It exists sort of priests that. But fuck kids, you know, but that's not the priesthood, right? I hope so. There's always going to be Aberman dip, shit, demonic behavior by our fellow man somewhere somehow.

Speaker 3:          00:43:25       But it is so rare in the hunting world that I, again, I, I, it's all. I do seven months a year as hunt. Well, I haven't hunted as much as you, but I've been around a lot of great people. Great people. Yeah. And then it goes right back to fred bear, which is the start off of our dialogue here. Great man. We hunted until 1987 together in October and he was on oxygen. Then he passed away. Have you ever heard the song? Yeah. Song. And then that song happened with a life of its own because of my love and admiration for the man and what he represented, someone like that, that just carries that torch further than everyone that at times we were so important at time where there was no indication that you have to. The animal rights thing hadn't really started, um, meaningfully yet. Um, political correctness, which wasn't even coined. There was no fake news. There was the beginning of the attack on hunting from, you know, ignorant, citified, people that somehow believed that their food didn't die or they're not responsible for any death. And so they would play the holier

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       than now dishonesty move by attacking those of us that actually took part in the process of feeding our families. And Fred was such a gentleman and he was so clever and he so efficiently promoted the challenge and the intimacy of man and wild connection that uh, he will live in infamy. Uh, everybody in the hunting world knows that he was a force to reckon with and he's always there and as the song says in the wind, he still alive and it's powerful that a lot of people know of him because of you or. Yeah, a lot people. More people have learned about Fred from me than from the archery industry. Yeah. Do you, do you this, this conversation you've been having this conversation about hunting forever. I mean, I've heard a lot of these things that you're saying today before from you. Does this the ever get tired of seeing this evangelist?

Speaker 1:          00:45:22       No. No. I love it so much and the other side is so dishonest that I know I make inroads. Yoda, my facebook, I'm dishonest. Or you think they're ignorant. They know that. They know that there's going to be new funds next year, but there's not gonna be any new ground. They know this. They know that venison is good food, but they don't think of it that way. That's why I continue to do this because I caused them to think. I can tell you thousands of examples since the sixties where people thought I was a coward for murdering innocent animals that can't shoot back. I mean, what does that sentence even mean? What it mean to catch you back and left trigger fingers yet jerk. So I have taken this on and you notice it. I smiled throughout that whole thing. I don't get angry. I'm so.

Speaker 1:          00:46:13       I know that by continuing to promote in the absence of any education and our education system, in fact, it's the opposite. Animal rights gets more time in our education system. Our anti-education is the media lion, sons of bitches, Hollywood goofy, half of the government out to lunch, so you guys like you and me that know the truth. We should never give up because there is a scourge of political correctness and dishonesty, and that's what political correctness is. Denial and dishonesty, and I know we're making inroads. You should see the bombardment. I got Joseph big hunter now. He's really a fighter. He speak cleverly, speaks accurately and and passionately about it. Hallelujah. There's a bunch of us out there with the advent of the outdoor channel and sportsmans channel, the pursuit network. Uh, more and more people are getting, you know, wind of what we're doing. I think a lot of it from the Internet to end, the monster communication people, I think people understand that there's more to it than they thought. And if they're willing to just look a little bit further, look a little bit further, they realized like, well, especially western hunting. Yeah. These guys are running hills and they're, they're, they're backpacking with heavy weights on their back discipline for hours and hours everyday just to build up their endurance and they can hike out with, meet these western hunters. Man that are going. MOFO is. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       bow hunting elk and then packing them out by themselves over the course of five days. Credible job. I went to Alaska first time when I was 20 something, I guess I must've been 28, my first Alaska trip 77 and I was out there for two weeks in a soggy, wet, nasty cold tent, a little pup tent with George Fairbury and I got a giant Caribou, a great black bear in a big old moose and boy humping them quarters in that, that Tundra, uh, yeah. I thought I was a superman athletic amplifier, jumping, rock and roll. So new muscle boy, my ass kicked, carrying a moose shoulder. $100 a quarter. Just one big moose. And you see one in real life. It's hard to believe that that's a real animal. And that goes back to what you were saying earlier, that when you dine on that and you put that effort forth and you spent all those days skunked and wet and cold and nasty, enjoying it for what it was, but it was also a pain in the ass.

Speaker 2:          00:48:28       You can't get wait to get back to some place with a wood burner, but when you've packed it out yourself, when you take that sacred flesh off that grill, before you even finished the first knife, slice all those memories and it just tastes better and it really does taste better, but with that effort, it is a spiritual moment that this linkedin native say you don't kill the animal. You accept the gift if you put your heart and soul into your reasoning Predator ship, and that's always been my mantra and my kids were all raised on Venison at, we just don't buy meat. That's all we eat is the stuff. We kill a pheasants and quail and Doug's and woodcock and grouse and rabbits and squirrels and ducks and geese and galloon mules and snipe and beavers and deer and elk and antelope and bear and Cougar.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       That's the greatest food in the world. I'm 70 years old and I'm forced to reckon with because of my discipline diet of the ultimate rocket fuel available. Unplanned. You really do look good for 17. Fucking fantastic. If I had some sleep, I'd be downright handsome, but you think about, you know the average person that's been eating the average American diet for 70 years old, by the time they're your age, they're deteriorating, rapidly poisoned, the fruit toast to the chemicals, the preservatives. Oh my God. Here's if I may on the Joe Rogan podcast, please do my friends. Get rid of the goddamn sugar. If you can't pronounce it on the package, do not buy it. Do not feed your children high fruit toast poisoning. My God, people get the poisons out of your blubbering lives. Good food is so simple by what? Catch a fish or buy

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       a fish by some fresh or grow some fresh vegetables. Put real butter and use the real fat. Don't take the skin off the chicken. That's where all the good fat is. That's where all the flavor is and eat real food. Wow. We can't afford that. No. You can't afford not to everything that says diet on it or no sugar is poison and it's not my opinion. It's a chemical reality and when you, when you died, when you attempt to digest fructose and preservatives, you're body goes, I don't recognize this bullshit. We can't process this, and it turns into blubber and here's a little update. Blubber is for sperm whales, not people. If you have to lift up slabs to dry off after the shower, your diet sucks. I saw you in an interview once, a long time ago before I started watching. I've done a bunch of them.

Speaker 3:          00:51:26       I know you have, but when I saw you I was like, how's this guy have so much fucking energy? I remember thinking that like, this guy is so fired up, and then he started talking about your diet started talking about. He said, all I eat is venison. You start going off about backstraps and then I started thinking like what? Like think about the dark red meat of wild game before you became 100. Quite a few years before. I flirted with it for several years, he flirted with. I didn't have anybody to take get a swan dive into it. I got lucky Steve to me with a mask on his show. I know Steve doesn't like me, but he's like, Huh? Why say he doesn't like you. I've heard comments with is attacking me for the whack 'em and stack 'em because he wouldn't be much better if I just butchered them and slaughtered them because semantics is so important.

Speaker 3:          00:52:11       Oh, W, the way you phrase things, waggaman snack on. It's fun. I'm whacking, I'm stacking. I got 12 bluegills. That's back. Shut the fuck up. Well, do people think that you were outrageous behavior or somehow detrimental to the movement of acceptance? Stupid people do, but the people who come and join the sport because of my exuberance don't. Well, I would say that godless, blessed Brunello and God bless Cameron. All those guys, I revere them. They're masters of their craft. I have caused more young people to become hunters than all other forces in the world. Case closed because I'm having so much fucking fun. They go, hey, this guy's out of control. Bows and arrows don't kill something. They absolutely come to it because of the fund. Then they hear about the discipline and hear about the quality diet and they hear about their spiritual trophy, whether antlers or not, that has guided my passionate life and manifest itself in these killer songs and killer guitar licks and outrageous fire-breathing concerts and they go, oh fuck, I can do that, and so they get a bone marrow. They shouldn't get a shotgun. They started hunting. Go to my facebook.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       I don't know if it's millions, but found thousands and thousands of young people that would be inclined to be anti hunting or no gun Ho hunters because uncle Ted is having so much fun because I whacked them and them. Well, congratulations with that. Yeah. The the. The thing is that they don't get.

Speaker 1:          00:53:44       When they hear your enthusiasm, then they go, okay, well I haven't had this perspective before. Their perspective on hunting that I've gotten before is that these are cruel assholes that go out there and shoot animals and they don't care and or worse or worse. Joe, that my critics, and I won't mention any names, but you know, when they're on, they're a hunting TV shows and they're so ultra cautious not to ruffle any feathers. They kind of come off like Mr Rogers with a Lawrence welk soundtrack. And young people think you're a fucking asshole if that's all you've got in a hunting. Is that boring? I think I'll just smoke some dope and go, you know, cruzen tonight, which I know you like to smoke dope. And uh, and I'll call it dope and go nuts. Do you call it? Well, I'm a cop. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       Well, but I got buddies for that. I just don't think that comfortably numb is the way to go. In fact, I have a solid song I ever. Well, you know a better song on my new record. It's called uncomfortably dumb. My point is, is, are you a father? Yes. You want your babysitter high? Uh, no. How about your doctor? No pilot. I don't want my babysitter sleeping either. You don't her what? Sleeping. I want them paying attention. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get high ever. It just means you shouldn't get high when you're watching kids. Damn. Right. Yeah. Or when you're flying my plane or I play Bass Guitar. The only compromise me doing anything delicate. You know, the only guy want high who? My comedians. Uh, it helps. It's like steroids. I was there when Richard Pryor and Robin Williams and Sam Kinison, God knows.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       Go ahead and snort anything you got motherfucker because I need to laugh. Delay Shit. It's hard to come out. But that shit sober every night. I'm a funny son of a bitch. You gotta come see my show. I have so much fun on stage. It's stupid. I think that perceptions about pot are very similar to the perceptions about. There's a lot of people that abused pot, they abused alcohol abuse. People will abuse every. Sure. It doesn't mean you can't use it responsibly. I agree. Um, unfortunately in my 60 years of pursuing the Chuck Berry Soundtrack of Ultra James Brown type music, I have never seen anything but heartbreak from drugs, from the drug use. Even in. I'm on a new council by the way of working with President trump to legalize medical marijuana nationwide. We don't want you to know that and I'm all for that. That was awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       I deal with a lot of terminally ill kids and there's nothing that's off limits. Take away that suffering. So I need to fight for that. Well, it's great for people with epilepsy as well. A lot of kids. Kids have autism. I got my bag out in the truck. Um, some guys making water with cannabis oil with the CDB is that part of CBD and sizzle. Helped me relax after my sonic bombast tortured gassed on stage every night. I'm sure it, they got to drink some of that shit. Well, I know you've had some problems with your knees and stand both new knees and both of them, you know, jumping off all those amps. I never knew. I never heard the word meniscus still. My doctor said I had none. I have a tear on mine. I just got a stem cell shots in it yesterday. I have two brand new knees and uh, I end dancing like the 25 year old Ted nugent.

Speaker 1:          00:57:09       But you're walking fine. I'm doing fine. So I used to have a bad limp right from that shuffle. Yeah. And now we're both gone. Steve Tyler was here from aerosmith and he's got a new one. He's got one new one and he's thinking about getting another one. Have both the same time. Yeah. How long were you down for? Um, I was walking the next morning. So what do they do exactly? Well, they're going to cut your knee open and they get a hammer and a chisel and they found out the old shit and put in some metal stuff. Have you ever seen this actually available online? You don't want to watch it if you're going to have it done. Oh, it's brutal. But I had a good surgeon and uh, it came out good. And the pain going on stage for so many years since certainly since the year.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       2,000 with the Damn Yankees. Even. What year did you get it done? A 2000. 18? No. 12 maybe. So 12 years of pain? Yeah, oh it was, it was more than that, but because I jumped off those fucking amplifiers. Blew your knees out. Oh my. What kind of dirt bag was I? Somebody should have said you have meniscus will you know, discuss, you know Maynard Keenan, the lead singer of tool, right. He blew his hip out from just stomping on the ground because the music. I have a new record called the music made me do it. The music made him do it. There's music made Steve. Tyler do it. When you get up there, it is a world unto itself. It is out of body is stream of consciousness. It you got to be careful because you think you're invincible. Invincible on net stage with Weiwei way that movie invincible.

Speaker 1:          00:58:52       They use stranglehold. Best use of my song ever. But anyhow. Best use of your song ever was randy coture coming out to stranglehold in the UFC? Yeah, you're probably right. Yes, I remember that. Yes. And the Black Hawks in Chicago, every gigs for the 25, 30 years, they came out the stranglehold when he beat Tim Silvia for the UFC heavyweight title, severe undercard underdog. And he came out and the place went nuts when he says it all to here, like come again, a baby like a dog in heat to me by the clamor baby. And I'd like to

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       tear up the street. I've been smoking for so long. I'm here to stay. I've got you in a stranglehold bitch. Get the fuck out of my way. Fucking awesome. You're getting. You're getting excited. It's a love song. The connection between rock and roll. Guitarist and bow hunting. For most people it's like a big stretch to stretch. It's like what are those different galaxies? Different universities, except for the most important elements in that is discipline. Discipline, the focus to create an. I've been so blessed beyond words to have the greatest musicians at my side for ever for literally 60 years right now. I got Greg Smith on the Bass Guitar. Just a god of thunder. Greg Smith the best, like a funk brother and heat and Jason heartless. Twenty three year old drummer from Detroit is just an absolute animal. And every band from my royal high boys and the fifties to the lords in the sixties.

Speaker 2:          01:00:17       And the Amboy dukes and even the Damn Yankees with Tommy and Jack and Michael. Are you kidding me? I've had literally the, a list of musicians at my side from Tommy Aldridge and Tommy [inaudible] and make brown and drums and, and, and cliff Davis. Are you kidding me? Denny Car Masiya. I mean the best drummers, the best bass players. I've just been the luckiest guitar player in the. But it's a weird connection, right? Like most people don't think of rock and roll and bow hunting at the same thing you do. You're the only one. But there I was geographically in Michigan, uh, a firestorm of musical influence to all the best musicians in the world. They'll tell you, come out of Detroit from Motown, Bob Seger. Now Kid Rock, eminem. And just just killer, killer bands. Mc Five. I got a great Wayne Kramer Story. He has a wonderful book coming out called the hard stuff you ever talked to Wayne, you need to have Wayne Kramer on your show.

Speaker 2:          01:01:10       He kisses him from New York, the MC five, but at rock city I'm thinking, yeah, I'm going to turn you onto Wayne Kramer. Has got a book about his tragic mistakes and near death, heroine prison, dirt bag maneuvers, but he's a great man, a musical authority, and in the music of Detroit and of course fifties little Richard. How do you not get moved by little Richard and Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry? How do you not how he had not touched by that and then you see him on tv and the Ed Sullivan show it. I don't care who you are. Steven, Tyler, Billy Joel or whoever, you know, Elvis Presley and now the stones and the Beatles. Are you kidding me? On Ed Sullivan and I had a guitar plus I'm in Michigan and I every kid was born. You got a red rider, daisy bb gun. You had a Wemo slingshot and you had a little bone Arrow of some kind.

Speaker 2:          01:02:01       I live right next to the rouge river, so I was always down there, you know, chase and critters and building forts and crossing the river and the music and the bowhunting music in the bowhunting. I met Fred Bear. I got these great musicians, the music and the bowhunting music and the book. Unbelievable. What a life, what a dream, what a firestorm of cravings and fulfillment of those cravings everyday. And here it is. Last night mares my 6680th concert and it goes all the way back to Stockholm. All counter to all the way back to the 19 fifties, 60,600. You write them down now. I did for years. I took out all the books and start adding them up. But from the, from my, uh, a musical review with the Royal School of music in 1958. And then with Joe [inaudible] from the Capital School of music at the Detroit fairgrounds. And then we started playing sock hops and pool parties and malt shops and everywhere, you know, basement parties.

Speaker 2:          01:02:58       I counted those, those are gigs. And then when the amboy dukes started in [inaudible] 65, we'd do 300 concerts, three plus 300 a year for many, many years. And then even with the Damn Yankees and the early nineties we did over 200 concerts a year. So I added them all up. And last year was 6,679 in Okinawa for the US Marine Corps. Pretty intense. And then last night at the coach house in San Juan Capistrano, 6,680 to 96, six 81. Jesus. Yeah. Cool. That's why I look tired. That's a lot of things in remedy. How do you have the time? Because I always figured out, I tried to figure out how I have the time to do what I do, but I think you do more than I do. Uh, I think we can both agree. The greatest philosopher of all times was dirty Harry when he said a good man knows his limitations back in the [inaudible] with the Amboy Dukes, we do over 300 concerts a year and I was still craving my hunting.

Speaker 2:          01:03:55       So I'd, I'd carve out a weekend in October and a weekend in November with my dad and we'd get out there and hunt. But that wasn't enough. What about practice time with the archery? Ida Bone Arrow on the road block target. Met in a parking lot somewhere. Morel targets for morale and it's got a spot, but no, I've shot my bow and Arrow on stage with thousands of contracts and then I always have it with me and I always have friends that have bows and arrows. In fact, I wish I had brought it today because I could show you some this zen of mystical flight of the Arab maneuvers. They had a really lightweight bowl, only 50 pounds. That new matthews. I shoot the new triax manager. There's not a bad bill out there. Not Anymore. The competition is awesome. So anybody listening to the most important thing you can tell, Joe and I love the mystical flight of the Arrow. Go get you a bow and Arrow shop fire hazard. Find a bowl that fits you and make sure it's graceful enough. Don't struggle when you're starting to. We've got to come back. Mushy. Archery is grace, not power and get that bow so it settles back here for hand. Eye Coordination, and you don't have to struggle. People should start with a 25, 30 pound bow to get that archery thing going. Preferably an old recover long boy if you can and find out where you're pointing, where's that Arrow going and you will be consumed with it

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       and then work your way. You can really teach you if you have to have a mentor because if you do it wrong and you start with a bad, bad habits will plague you. Then you could target panic. Well, it's a. that's a problem with martial arts too. It's really important to start off with a good instructor if you learn things poorly first and then try to fix it, but you're still kind of wired incorrectly. It's very difficult and archery as well, right? That's why America is in trouble because people are learning at schools. That's a really good analogy. I mean really learning the wrong stuff. I mean, it really is what's going on. You know, you get taught that life is boring, droning. Pay attention to the rules. Show me, show me a graduate from the American anti-education system that can balance a checkbook. Does people do that anymore where they ought to know?

Speaker 1:          01:06:06       Unfortunately they don't hedge the debt. You know, pragmatism went the way of maps, but you know what I mean. I'd be pragmatic. Be Responsible, be accountable. Be Utilitarian. Self be the best that you can be. Call your body the sacred temple that it's supposed to be treated with reverence, eat good, be good, be the best that you can be. Be Competitive. Life isn't fair. Get used to it. If you want to excel in life, you show up earlier than the competition. You work harder than competition. You do a better job than the competition. You stay later than the competition. You'll end up owning the damn company. Yeah, and learning how to think. Learning how to think and learning how to look at things. It's something that's never taught in school and it's one of the most important lessons in your life and you learn that lesson, I think through doing difficult things.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       Absolutely. I had a conversation about you once and someone was like, well, what do you think? He's like, I go, look, this is what you have to understand. Forget about all the public shit. He's awesome at two things that are really hard to be good at. Guitar in Bowhunting, very difficult. Both very difficult to be disciplined. You have to be an exceptional person, especially since you sound like such shit for so long and the guitar, there's no satisfaction whatsoever. You go out for how many years took years. I was the worst. All my buddies learned faster than I did. In fact, I just met up with Donnie Henderson. He's probably listening right now and he was in a band called the gang when I had a band called the lawyers. We kicked their ass and won the battle of the bands in Michigan when I was about 13 or 14 and he and I are still friends and he's.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       I guess he's going to be 70 soon too, and he played all the Chuck Berry and Bo diddly stuff. Perfect. And I'm stumbling and making stupid noises, but you know what happened because I couldn't figure out the exact licks. I created my own style and I started playing. People thought I was being clever. I just wasn't doing them wrong, but it still had a good rhythm at a kind of cool Santa. Yeah. Like John Coltrain meets, you know, a punk kid play in bodiddly licks, and so I developed my own style and I've had a lot of fun with it. But with all your question is though, with all your media, all the stuff that you

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       do, you're, you're constantly doing interviews and phone interviews. You're constantly doing things. How do you have time to do all this? Still write music. I have a great team. You were talking about Linda getting ahold of your team. Linda Peters have been with me for 30 years. Uh, Doug Bankers, been my manager for over 30 years of all my crew, Chris Helms and Jim nap and my sons and my daughters. Um, my wife Charmaine is the goddess. If you ever seen Shane, sure God help me. Senior show. Oh, she's so good. And she's the queen of the forest. He is the queen of the forest. Full time. Not a damn thing you can do about it. And I have such a great team. My crew on the road right now. I leave nothing to chance. I don't have to worry or think about a thing. All I have to do is play my guitar and rock my balls off, so I always had a great team, professional work ethic, monsters that are conscientious.

Speaker 3:          01:09:13       I'm dedicated, professional, knowledgeable, so there's no loose ends and that's how I'm able to do all. You're this, but you're also this really loud voice in the culture war have to be, you know, you have to be. I, I refuse to let lives go unchallenged. I refuse to let antilogic going. Challenged antilogic like what? Like did you. You don't need secure borders really. So the Democrats, I think we need to secure our borders and the Democrats don't admit there's a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration. Let me give you a little metaphor. If you go to the bank and withdraw from your account, your illegal banker, if you go to the bank and draw from someone else's account, you're a bank robber. That was a division. There were four of legal banking. We're not for illegal banking and this kind of antilogic has weaseled his way into policy and it's just tragic with the multi trillion dollar debt and unsecured borders and we're worried about separating families, which we failed to say.

Speaker 3:          01:10:14       If you're going to come here, come legally are we will send you back. We send out a message, have edit. Just go ahead and implement across the dam river. Well, do you personally have a problem when they separate families? Because I'm a father and a grandfather. Yeah, the fucked up. But the real fuck up starts with the, the, the insane irresponsibility of daring to subject your children to that. I don't think they have any choice at a dinner over there. They live in Mexico and Guatemala is one big gang infested government. Military law enforcement. Shithole. Yeah. Yeah. And if you call it a shit hole, I'm racist. Well, if it wasn't a shit hole, they would stay. It is a shit hole. You ever been there? Well, some, some. Uh, Mexico is also. Some of the Mexico hasn't been raped and pillaged yet, but give them time.

Speaker 3:          01:11:04       They'll make it that even in the big resorts they're murdering and raping and bureau realizing people. I mean, it's just a hell hole. There's definitely some bad things happen in a lot of it is because of the drug war out of control. Yeah, and a lot of people think that the remedy to that is legalizing drugs and taxing man. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean the same thing with prohibition. Same thing that would happen in America really boosted organized crime and Al Capone and they. They got a stronghold because of the money they were making from illegal drugs or alcohol at the time. I think that right now that the spoiled Brat epidemic in this country, if you don't get everything, you want you to start shooting people or cut people off and road rage if everything doesn't go just right. Everybody is so touchy and so pussified that when I was growing up, sticks and stones may break your bones, but words will never hurt me.

Speaker 3:          01:11:56       What do you think that's coming from the liberalization of policy and the the horrible lie of the welfare dream that people who need a helping hand are always given a helping hand by neighbors and family and friends, and if they have. Well, the Catholic Church has $8,000,000,000,000 just in jewelry. They could probably provide some sandwiches and blankets so there's plenty of help available, but when you get into a system and you, you play on the people's emotions that we need a safety net, these poor people are just too. You need help. Okay, let's create a welfare where we can help these destitute people. Meanwhile, it's infested with scammers and blood suckers and liars who are abled bodied and they just don't want to stop it to help. One is sign. They want some of your income because you're stupid enough to get up early and work really hard and they don't want to.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       That's pandemic. So meanwhile the people who are truly needy, they slipped through the cracks. We don't even get to know who they are and and the the liberal policy of eliminating the heartbreak and the disrespect of Cuckoo's nest. We can. We can call them mental health centers. We might hurt some feelings. So now what are they doing? They're putting spikes in boards and attacking people, walking their dog and La. He said there's no place for them to go. When I was growing up, there's a place in Detroit called a [inaudible]. It was a nuthouse and that's the Cuckoo's nest. That's where if you were mentally ill and you needed help that there was a place for you to go to get you off the streets so you don't attack people with spikes in Dubai. What are you talking about? The spikes in right here, right down the street here.

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       One, two days ago. Tact some, a fashion photographer walking his dog and hit him in the head with a two by four with a spike and almost killed him in a. In a citizen. I didn't even hear about it. Oh yeah. It was awesome. Citizen jumped up in the air and caught this guy with both feet right in the neck and neck. Beat the shit out of him. It was awesome. That's nice. That was a rare occasion of justice. Pro Wrestling comes in handy, but yes, but that, that incident is not rare where you go to San Francisco and the mental health institution isn't supposed to be the streets. That mental health is a good example of too much liberal policy. You get people that are a little bit too progressive and regressive. I don't know. How did they ever utilize that term that's bastardized as progressive?

Speaker 3:          01:14:19       It gets so far that it becomes regressive when you're letting bombed shit all over the streets. But thank you. I think that would be an indicator. So there's. So the idea is that just like these poor people leave them alone, you know, they're fine. They just, you know, it's okay if they live on the streets, but if you go to San Francisco, they're very aggressive. It's one of the weirdest places I've ever been in terms of homeless people and one of the most heartbreaking unquote progressive places in our country. So one of the most progressive cities, heartbreaking. We need more cuckoo's nest, but even those institutions, the corruption and the abuse of power that runs ramp into nurse Cratchit and that, that, that, that wasn't just a fantasy scrip that happens the irresponsibility and in, in pharmaceutical, everybody, you know, they got a mental problem and then they increased the mental problem with big farm.

Speaker 3:          01:15:10       I mean, I've had personal experiences with that with dear friends of mine that were having mental problems and they end up in an institution and then their mental problems are exasperated by chemical warfare upon them. You don't. When I was growing up, how old are you, Joe? Fifty slash 50 just to boy. Um, when I was growing up there was this, this mantra, this colloquialism better living through chemistry in many ways it is. I mean, we saved tens of millions of lives in Africa with DDT by killing the Zec fly and we save tens of millions of people. And then some environmentalist come in and the DDT is a dangerous chemical, so they stopped it and we lost tens of millions of people. It's better to kill a bunch of seats. He flies to save human lives than to band the DDT. That allows tsetse flies to flourish and kills people. Uh, so now it's gone full circle and that's where the toxins have accumulated and the, the horrific waste that I had texted anthony just before he died, congratulating him, hunt his hosting that brilliant documentary if you haven't seen it yet, it's waste, waste, exclamation point, what we do to where foods in this country and the self inflicted scourge of, of, of toxification, of our precious environment.

Speaker 3:          01:16:31       So there's not a lot of easy answers. But here it is, 28th of June, 2018. And here you and I are at least discussing this stuff to millions of people, I suspect. And I see upgrade taking place. I see upgrade in awareness, uh, not fast enough to make me happy, but, uh, enough to indicate an upgraded prognosis for people's awareness, accountability, responsibility. Where, where are you seeing this? Uh, whether it's, you know, like the circles that you travel circles certainly in

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       we don't waste. One of my biggest pet peeves is little fat kids that, you know, take a sip of $2 bottle of water and then they leave it there and ended up throwing it away and the waist is pandemic in this country and I see my, my kids are like, like storm troopers there, like drill sergeants with that we just don't want to waste and we've always recycled and the jury is still out, whether that has any effect at all. But the, the, the disconnect in unconscionable misbehavior of just tossing and throwing away everything. You know, what drives me fucking crazy. Cigarettes out the window. People just went. The people that smoke cigarettes for whatever reason, to have a problem throwing it on the ground, he wouldn't let her. How about what drives me crazy? There's somebody still stupid enough to buy cancer. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1:          01:18:04       Here, let me invest in the companies that want to kill me here. Here's a couple extra thousand dollars. Kill more of us. Strange. Cool. It makes it look a rebel man. Well, I've never smoked. I've never smoked a cigarette. No drugs, no drugs, no alcohol? No. You drink a little wine though. Fat Pussy. I'm telling you, that shit will kill you know families. No, not even a little allergic. I'm a big fan for those who want, but no, I drink a little wine though. I do drink a little wine, but I don't think that qualifies as a drink. Having a glass of wine with my sons and my daughters, my brothers and sisters, they Thanksgiving dinner. Beer. Beer is better than coke, right? Vastly. Sure. It's when you start to enter the drool zone that I have a big problem of course, and all of a sudden if there's a problem, I can't rely on you anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       I want to be reliable and that's why I have a problem with comfortably numb. Yeah. I think in my experience, you can't wake up the bass player because he was comfortably numb. The guys don't show up. You can't tune his guitar. He forgot. The lyrics were not as tight as we could be. You're fired. I know what you're saying, but this is what I'm saying to you is that this is just a discipline issue and it's not the marijuana or anything that gets people like that. It's a lack of discipline. I think Jitsu world and the Jujitsu world is filled with people that smoked pot and these motherfuckers work hard. They want. What's the number one karate guy? Who was the guy that died personally? Yeah. Bruce Lee. Did he smoke dope? Uh, he ate hash. The Hash. Yeah. You know, he's into eating half. Here's my question, but that's not what killed them. Here's my question to you is I offered to my son Rocco, because he's an advocate of marijuana. Yes. Okay. And I said, Rocco. And I said, and I said, so do you really believe that? Perfectly clean and sober [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:20:07       taking care of your health with a conscientious diet,

Speaker 2:          01:20:11       good athletic workout, discipline, physical prowess, [inaudible]. Do you really think that an outside source, payoti mushrooms, dope, whatever you want to call it, do you really think that with that outside influence you can do something you can't do unto your God given gift, individual self? I'm convinced, Joe, that you will be the absolute best you can be. You will accomplish what I think is a self inflicted curse of modern man, that 90 percent, 98 percent of humanity might be tapping into five percent of their capabilities because they get on a treadmill. They get into a paradigm self restricted pier nine ever so decreasing a view of the world and experiences and the overwrote, the destroyed road over traveled versus not only the road less traveled, but the non road untraveled. That's my favorite. I'm convinced that you, Joe Rogan will find your superior definitive best without any outside influence.

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       I believe you have the power. I think I have the power when I get onstage tonight and you gotta come you gotta come witness this, but my bed and I do like it out. We'll figure out a time. I can't come tonight. It's like Italy. I got an orgy. So at the Improv of human fire, we put our fists together and chant James Brown and Wilson Pickett and funk brothers and it's like the last wolves on an island gun gnashing of teeth over the last bone. And Charlotte of flesh, it's, it's a, it's an out of body soaring above life itself. Experience that we have in us. I don't need anything. I understand me, I understand that. But you don't use anything, so you're talking from a place of non experience when it comes to marijuana or mushrooms or any of these things. But my 70 years, I'd say at least 55 of those years from the beatniks to the hippies, to the, to the friends.

Speaker 2:          01:22:27       And you got to meet this Wayne Kramer, guide Mc five guitars, new book, the hard stuff. He and I were born the same time, same influenced Detroit, the swamps, the outdoors, but bodiddly, Chuck Berry, Motown, James Brown. He started smoking dope. I didn't. And he's a any. Got Heroin and had any prison again. And then arrested and I'm having the time of my life and he's like wallowing in a cesspool of dog shit. And I'm not knocking Wayne. I'm saying that he was courageous to write this book. It's a brilliant book. You got to have them on. You're going to read it. You're gonna. You're going to be consumed

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       by his conversational writing of the MC five's a ascension to the most authoritative power house music I've ever witnessed in my life, to a bunch of dirt bags on the downward spiral because of drugs and alcohol. I know that happens. It definitely happens, but it happens with everything. It happens with people when they eat too much food. It happens with people with gambling. It happens in different things, but I think it's because of discipline. It's because they don't have a clear path. I think it's because they let themselves become self indulgent and they let themselves be weak, but I'm saying is that I know a lot of people who use, whether it's psychedelics or they use marijuana and they use it to enhance their perspective. It doesn't become the primary focus of their life. It doesn't consume their life. They don't allow it to consume their life.

Speaker 4:          01:23:55       There's a whole other world of disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and they're confused. Same way people confuse hunter's the same way. People think of hunters as being lazy. Drunk and slavs were cruel to animals and you and I know that that's not the case at all, some of the most disciplined focused and just people in the world, intense people because to be, to be at Cameron Hanes, to be a John Dudley, you have to be a superior type of human being super athletes. You have to be able to execute in that extreme moment, that moment where that animal walks out into that shooting window and you're looking at this three 90 bull elk screaming, screaming, overwhelming all over itself over whelming and it's 40 yards away and your center in that pen. It takes magical, powerful human being to execute that shot and I don't think most people are aware of that.

Speaker 4:          01:24:48       Most people don't know in the same way that that's misunderstood. I think marijuana is misunderstood because there's a lot of dummies in this world. If you get a group of 100 people, what are the odds that one of them is going to be a dummy? Fucking 100 percent, right? One hundred percent nowadays more than one. Well, if you get a group of 100 people that use marijuana, the one loud fucking stupid one defies or defines rather what marijuana users are. You see that fucking idiot who's pissing all over himself and fallen down so high you can't walk. That's what you think of. You don't think of the Brazilian Jujitsu black belt that smokes pot and then goes out and strangles 50 people in class. You don't think of people that take yoga class. I liked hiring marijuana. Strangling there should be. Listen, I'm absorbing, absorbing, in, respecting and considering your work.

Speaker 4:          01:25:39       It can get away from you can get away from you. All I've ever said, everything can get away from you. That's all I've ever seen, but I think it's because these people that consume it, they don't have those other qualities. They don't have discipline and focus. They don't have respect for their body. See, the thing with the, especially in the Jujitsu community, it's super common. Marijuana is really, really, really, really common. Yeah. I mean, there's a show called high rollers where these guys, they put together a Jujitsu tournament and everybody had to get high before they rolled and you're talking like elite world class Brazilian Jujitsu, black belts competing high on marijuana, and that's got to be one of the highest forms of disciplines very available to us. It's a very, very. With the camera and climbing bowhunting Coleen and milk in your lap. Well you're, you're, you're doing an art that's designed to break bodies and the two of you are going to do it together and the whole idea is that you're going to get someone into a position where they have to tap or they're going to get their arm snapped or they're going to get choked.

Speaker 4:          01:26:35       Unconscious said intense. Extremely difficult pursuit and a lot of people do it under the influence of marijuana. Do you know any of these master Jujitsu martial artists? Oh yeah. Fit that. Don't do any. Oh yeah. And how did they perform? They perform well. Do very well. There's. Look, there's an elite world class athletes in Jujitsu that don't. Do you know if the world champion got high or not? Well, I know a lot. I do, but I know a lot of them do. A lot of world champions do. I know a lot of like real multiple time world champion. They're marijuana users. Yeah. How about world champions that don't get high? There's a lot of those to see. What happens with marijuana is increased sensitivity that a lot of people talk about. They call it paranoia because there's a lot of things that people put blinders on their life.

Speaker 4:          01:27:23       A lot of people aren't aware, and I'm sure because of your hunting, you're spending time in the woods. You're soaking in all the variables. The sound when I'm a radar there. Right. You're aware there's a lot of people that go through life like this. No. They go through life like they're looking through a toilet paper roll there in the left lane right now. Yeah. They're not. They're not using their blinkers and those people, those people, when they smoke marijuana, they freak out. They get paranoid because what's happening is the marijuana increases. Your sensitivity makes you aware of all these variables and a lot of people consider that paranoia. He started freaking out about all these variables. You start thinking about your mortality and instead of embracing this time as a magical moment, instead of being in this moment, you just start getting overwhelmed and you feel your own heartbeat and you start freaking.

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       Now this all the time, it's without anything. It's an entheogenic. It brings you closer to whatever you are not encumbered by your ego. I will admit in escapable that everything affects everyone differently. Yes, but once you make it widespread, I mean, I've studied the results of legalization for recreational use in Colorado and how the highway fatalities and accidents have increased, but you know what else has increased the population in proportion, so it causes breeding. Thousands is more people there. More people are there, so you having more accidents there. The problem is is a boom of population also a boom in the economy of boom, in the real estate. Real estate's taking off. Yeah, there's a lot of losers there too, because a lot of hacky sack playing dirty, stinky hippies that are wandering around with no shoes on. You're going to get those. You're going to get those.

Speaker 4:          01:29:01       You know, if you have an opening welcome society that's. That doesn't lock those people up, you're going to have those as a part of freedom. Yeah, it sucks. Losers are a part of this safe world that our kids are allowed to wander too. We want the world to be safe, so sometimes things are too safe. You nerve the edges and you get a bunch of people that are used to hitting their heads on things and they're not worried about it. You're going to have these losers, but it doesn't mean that everybody who does, it's a loser. I know a lot of CEO's of big corporations that have responsibilities and they liked to smoke a little pot. I get, I get punched back off and on facebook. I'm a successful guy, run my family. I'm a good dad. I'm a good hunter and I'm a. I'm a trump supporter and I get high.

Speaker 4:          01:29:43       Oh God bless you. I just, I don't watch a babysitting my kids while you're high. Yeah, but it's discipline. Discipline is the thing that fucks people up and the lack of this lack of the lack of discipline and I think that's with everything and could be with sex. It could be with gambling, it could be with extreme risky behaviors. People could just get, get real nutty and get carried away with things and sometimes those things are just a big distraction for the lack of discipline they have in pursuing their own goals in life. I think that that is the real high in life. The real high end life is pursuing difficult things. Ratification, yes, getting good at them and then accomplishing your goals. There's A. There's a high to that that's. You can't find that in pills. It doesn't exist in the needle. That high is a high of discipline and determination and focus in learning, but there's so much weakness out there, especially in a society that has been spoiled for so long and you get a trophy if you don't even show up and you can't hurt people's feelings and bullied, get bullied and you're crying.

Speaker 4:          01:30:42       Should fight and back, I mean there's so many manifestation of a cultural deprivation that runs a muck in our society that my fear is nice. Studied all these mass shootings. Joe, the Virginia Tech shooter high. Well, they're all buying high. Yeah, but they're all on SSRI. Yes. They're all on pills and pharmaceuticals. Almost all of them are on the PROZAC and their parents or all of them are chemical covering up a kid that shows enthusiasm. It's called an attention disorder now. I mean, if they had that back when I was growing up, I had ended up playing. I don't know, I ended up being nosy, but the problem is the word drugs, like you and I are drinking coffee. We're on drugs right now. We're on caffeine. This is a drug. There's some drugs that if used responsibly or. Okay. A glass of wine with dinner is a drought. Understood. It's a mild drug, a little tiny Toke for sex with the Mrs. That's a little drug and it makes you see I've never smoked because I can't smoke. I get in, when I shoot my machine guns, all I do is chew on a Cuban. I don't really smoke it well. You can get a little buzz. Just love it. Seems to go with brash rainbows. When I had that tight, tight, tight site, I was way faster than my best. My best morning

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       with my m four a, it's a, it's a [inaudible] carbon. And I got a pof upper to piston driven. So instead of 600 plus rounds, minutes over 700 rounds a minute and my $600 to sit, whether it is way too low, but they actually had the original, um, uh, Thompson's. We're 900 rounds a minute and nobody including sargent rock could control that. So they backed it down to 600, but that's 45 and it's got a whole lot of lift. My two to three m for my best morning. And this is how uncle Ted parties, Apache helicopter M, four bags of Ammo, 469 hogs. One day we played videos that you and pig phillips. No ridiculous that, that is every wild. But that the pig problem is the one that throws in the face of vegans. That's a weird one because you, you got to do something about those animals because they're going to destroy your food.

Speaker 3:          01:33:01       Sure. They're going to eat every when we kill pigs like that in such mass numbers from helicopters with machine guns, we're literally saving the environment, feeding a lot of people. We the pork that we process. Thousands and thousands of people get this pure organic port and it's delicious. The best. The wild pork without white fat, dark meat handy. So. So we're saving the environment from the pig destruction. We're saving agriculture. I eat food production from the pig destruction. We're saving tax dollars from hiring sharp shooters. We're saving all wildlife because the alternative would have been a indiscriminate poisoning campaign and recreating a huge new industry of helicopter hog hunting. When? When? When, when, when, when will copter Haagan serious party time USA. And guess who passed that law? You did. Thank you very much. Again, me and Chris Cole back. We were hunting and we weren't allowed to pay the helicopter pilot by law.

Speaker 3:          01:33:59       You couldn't be a for profit outfit unless the government paid him, which was so, so and Texas, so Kris Kobach, who was the secretary of state and Kansas and was running for governor and should be governor of Kansas. He's a constitutional master and he. He took the current a pig hunting law firm, helicopters that was government controlled. No, no citizens, no commercial value whatsoever. He rewrote it. We gave it to then Attorney General Greg Abbott and Governor Perry at the time and we said, this is insane. This can't be Texas where you get to hunt the pigs on our land, but we can't, so literally within a week or two, they passed the law where it became a commercial outfit where we, the people can hunt the pigs out of helicopters and it's become a huge success. It's really knocked the shit out of this dangerous pig population in those areas where land owners allow it and give authorization and if so much fun, it's stupid. Well, that's what people need to realize. You re, there's no way to get to them

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       in certain circumstances. There accessible. There are millions and millions of wild pigs. They have three, four litters a year, and there's no way to take care of them naturally. Unless you gonna let hundreds of thousands of wolves loose in Texas. I'd really don't sit down with them from the helicopters. Yeah, I mean how. I mean, that's what they do in Alaska when they decimate the care enough to they. There's no other way to control these pigs other than God bless you, joy. Not many people know that. They don't know that and it's a. it's a real problem when you talk to people were animal rights activists, like, how do you propose to fix this? That will like, well, you know, they shouldn't be here in the first place. They're an invasive species that people, Bro. That's fine. You're right. But they're handing over in the 17 hundreds. So what do we do?

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       So. So arrest. Captain Cook. Yeah, exactly. Arrest William Randolph hearst because he released a bunch of them are in northern California. That's where it starts to hone. Ranch came from those pigs down and they worked their way down and they're awesome. They're delicious, delicious. The best pork in the world, people who eat normal pork have no idea what real pork tastes like. I smoked some for a friend of mine. This is insane. I'm like this. He's like, this is insane. Put it over. A good coal will coles. Yeah, it's candy. Brian did for a few days and here's a little trick for you. I. I'm a vernors Ginger Rail Guide, Detroit brewed bottled and Ginger, Detroit vernors. It's the only ginger ale without ginger from the fortunate is full of fructose, so I don't drink it anymore, but you can cook with it. Next time you Brian, a slab of pork, put in a good olive oil and all the seasons you like, but also can have vernors ginger ale because it's got real ginger and just enough sugar in it to affect it and soak that overnight in a glass dish.

Speaker 1:          01:36:41       Covered up in a cool like a refrigerator and then put that sum bitch on some hot orange, Kohl's. I don't care. Apple, Cherry, Mesquite, Hickory, whatever. You got old. Doesn't matter and let that song bitch just singed on the outside. It's. It's food, sex. It's your in a wreck, your palate erection. You get a culinary boner. It's so delicious. That's what we eat at home. That's how we eat. That's why I'm like this. Do you ever use a pellet grill? I haven't, no. My, um, my ranch manager, Chris has got one. Um, and he used a big fan of those things because it's real wood, right? It's just compressed wood shots they take, like from making this table should take that sawdust to compress it down. But I have all this timber we have at our properties. I like cutting down dead trees and making my own firewood.

Speaker 1:          01:37:30       Is that what you do? You Cook over here? Well, there's a, there's something to that, right? Yep. Yep. It's the real mccoy. Yeah. My, my taste buds are as sacred as my dick. I mean, I want to make sure I treat my taste buds really good. I consider my life to be like one big six foot two, 220 pound purple rim. Dick. I'm susceptible to all influences and stimuli and that's where I get this passion in this happiness everyday. Spoiled rotten. I get to hunt everywhere, that's what's crazy and I get to rock my balls off every year. So I'm the lucky one in your yard. You essentially leave your house. My swamp in Michigan, I have to close the door quietly because I have tree stands really close to the cabin and it's. The swamp is, it's a miracle. It's just, I think God loves me more than he loves you because you created this place just for me and it.

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       It's a, it's a glacier cut marsh swamp. Phen phen is no fen fen. It's a very unique wetland habitat that's a cross between a marsh and swamp and a bog and it's the, uh, the uh, habitat that produces the Mitchells cetera butterfly environment, which is the Christmas tree from and on my Michigan Fan, I have the healthiest productivity of the endangered species, Christmas tree fern and Mitchell's setter. Butterfly according to the biologists and the botanists that visit there every year from universities because I killed lots of critters that would otherwise denude those touchy for her wild vegetations. And that's why a hundred every day up there, I coons and possums and skunks and beavers, mink and muskrats and pheasants up the as I. I'm the only ground in southern Michigan that has pheasants because I wage war environments. You cannot hurt vomit populations. In fact they are drastically under harvested.

Speaker 1:          01:39:27       But on mine, I killed so many egg rate environments that I have the best biodiversity of all, including the endangered Mitchell Saturday butterfly and Christmas tree fern because I'm a steward who actually walks the wild ground, unlike a bureaucrat who looks at the computer screen and is dnr office and makes an assumption of what the model might indicate instead of what the actual wild ground will show you if you get the fuck off your chair and go walk that say, well, that's a big criticism to people or from people that, uh, especially like people in bc that are now a part of that grizzly bear band, unbelievably dishonest. They're getting people that live in the city that don't have any interaction with these animals and that these animals are trouble. There's a lot of them. They're not there can only you can eat them too, by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:40:16       I think their stakes bear backstraps candy, especially in the spring if they're eating berries and the grass, but the perception is that what you're doing is trophy hunting, that you know you're eating, you're shooting something you don't plan on eating, just to put a hand on you because you're a cruel person. How dishonest can you be? Well, they're not talking to the people that are in the forest, the actual people that are on the ground, and that's, that's a real part of the problem is that these laws get passed by these people that have no interaction with this actual environment. It's like people who live in a drought voting on what's going on in your flood. Yeah. You know, it's like the people in Detroit voting on wolves in the upper peninsula. If you don't

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       live with bull with the wolves, you don't get say so. You need to respect the people who live with the wolves and wolves. Don't buy licenses. Wolves don't buy permits. Wolves don't pay fees. Wolves don't have bag limits. Wolves don't have seasons. They just like to kill stuff and if you have too many wolves, nobody spending money on deer license or bear license or small game hunting, and the upper peninsula of Michigan has been abandoned by a bunch of politically correct ignorant city jerks who think they have to save the endangered wolf. I want wolves in Michigan, but not to the detriment of wildlife that actually pays for the game department to manage it for a sustained yield productivity, Duh. But that's the thing we're talking about here, right? Like wildlife management, like this idea that you have to manage the population of pigs. You also have to like what you're doing in your place in Michigan.

Speaker 3:          01:41:44       You're managing this wildlife to the ultimate diversity that if you don't have to deal with walls and if you don't yet higher tax paid sharp shooters that have no respect for the animals at all. They're just doing a job of killing stuff, which is what they do in California with the mountain lions. Unbelievably irresponsible. And here's a challenge and a condemnation for the California fish and game society. The cod fish and game anymore, they call it fish, fish and wildlife. Because of that, how can you go to work everyday, violating your oath to wildlife science? How can you force the mountain lion and the black bear and California into the liability column as a game warden, as a person dedicated to conservation, how can you violate your wise use oath and turn them out in line and the black bear into a liability because some dirt bag in San Francisco think it's unfair to use hounds or bait for bear and then you have to go in and shoot black bears with tax dollars and buried them in a hole in the ground instead of a family recreational, a resource that you buy licenses and fees and permits and guides and outfitters, hotels, food lodging, grocery supplies, butcher's ice, taxidermists.

Speaker 3:          01:43:05       None of that happens because the some liar has forced the wildlife manager, wildlife mismanagement of California to ban mountain lion hunting. While you continue to kill them as damage control, instead of manage them as quality control. Shame on the California wildlife officers. Shame on you for not blowing the whistle. It's like, call me at the FBI, how dare you walk into that building that says j Edgar Hoover over the top and not feel a sense of guilt because j Edgar Hoover was one of the biggest criminal punks that ever walked this earth and now call me is following in his footsteps and I challenged my FBI buddies. How did you go all these years without blowing the whistles on the corruption, the power abuse and the criminality by your so

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       called leaders? I don't know enough about pussy to comment, but I don't know enough about what you did do. I do know because he's a liar and he's. He's a. he's a perjurer and he's a felon and he had a. I'm really angry because I worked with the FBI. I've had to rely on these guys to cover my back on on raids and they're great warriors and they look the other way because they're saving their pensions and instead of blowing the whistles on there, corrupt criminal leaders. Damn them. Well, I don't know how that relates to mountain lions. Like to bring it all back. Corruption is corruption. Same thing, but I was saying I don't think it's corruption here, wildlife officers that I don't think they're getting this conversation. I think there is some that they're trying to preserve their jobs. They don't want to stick their neck out with a very liberal government, but you know, I think that there's.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       There's a real problem with education that this conversation doesn't happen in most circles. This understanding of balance, of nature of that you really do have to manage the wardens. They know what they studied, they got degrees in it and they defy it and it's good. Good about permits. After the mountain lion is destroyed, millions of dollars worth of livestock and pets and it scared the shit out of people and killed people. Then they kill them, kill them before they just do the depth. Supposed to be quality control, not damage control. They know the system, they've abandoned it and they've gone the political correct denial route and said that the mountain lions are not game animals. That is a lie. So the California Game Department are Liars, period. With the idea of the mount lines on a game. Animal comes from people that have never eaten one. Yeah, the estimate backstrap.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       Most people don't know. I've never eaten one, but I know people that have he delicious, delicious, which beautiful p. You hear, you tell that to people and they go, wait a minute. What I can bear. A lot of people don't think eat bears. Eat Berries. You dirt bag. Who doesn't know this? Wake up. A lot of people don't know they're idiots. I've had conversations with people because I'm 100 bears that no one has gotten more mad at me at anything I've ever done. Then when I killed a bear, good, good for you. That you pissed. If you're not pissing off the assholes, you're an asshole, but it's people that don't understand what a bear is not around. Then they don't understand. I recommend shut the fuck up. Go do a little research and come back when you have some knowledge. Until then, suck my dick.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       No, it's better to just explain to them what it is and I see it over and over again. Refused. They refused to listen. Yeah, they. They liked their ignorance. They go to maniacal levels to protect their ignorance because it feels good because it's booboo. It's really a tune. I respect animals, so I'm going to reduce them to the level of a cartoon. What's also weird too, because there was a deprivation permit that was issued for a mountain lion in Malibu because it was killing the got to this Alpaca farm and just went fucking crazy. Like 10 Alpaca and Alpaca. Yum. Yeah, just fucked. I didn't even eat. I'm just fucked him off. They laid lines to kill. I'm a

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       big fan, so a deprivation depredation permit was issued so this. They destroyed a bunch of livestock so this lady could kill this cat that had been really qualified, so she was going to hire somebody, but then she got all these death threats, which is hilarious, but here's the thing, people say they love animals. Well, you obviously don't love these Alpine lions coming in and fucking killing them all the time. The way they die, a slow death because the lion just bites them and let them bleed to death and flop around for a couple hours and then goes to the one that's next to it. He's just trying to get away. It's the ignorance is staggering and that's why I continue to fight it. It's convenient, right? It's like, we love animals. We don't want to kill this mountain lion. Okay, well if you love animals, you'll let them kill this one mountain line that's obviously targeting these pets because this is not hunting.

Speaker 4:          01:47:37       By the way. You know why they're mountain lion is targeting the pests because there's too many mountain lions and the dominant males have run all the other mountain lions out of ideal habitat into your neighborhood because you didn't harvest the surplus. Now the surplus is coming into your home. Now it's a liability because you were too stupid to keep it in the asset column. It's absolutely sinful. People have accomplished. They have a pond over it to hone ranch. They have a game camera, the trail camera on that pond. They got 16 different mountain lions are in that camera. Then they're not allowed to do damn thing and it's hard to find deer. It's hard to find deer here. It's like it's nothing. I mean, the one thing is good people aren't dying in car accidents with deer, but if you see a deer in California, it's.

Speaker 3:          01:48:17       It's pretty rare, but again, there's plenty of cattle. I fly over California. I Love California, man. My blood brothers live out here. We're having the greatest conscience. My late last night in San Juan Capistrano firestorm tonight, tomorrow night we're in Pasadena, and then we'd go to a Gore hills. Clear Rita. Yeah, and then we go to big bear and then we go to reno and we'd go to Iowa and Ohio and Pennsylvania and know we're all over the country and I fly in a little plane over the country and it's God's country. It's wildlife habitat. It eternally all across this country and California is one of the most beautiful wilderness states in the world, and because mountain lions have been irresponsibly mismanaged, now you have a destruction of the wildlife in the deer category and those small game and other game because the mountain lions are in the liability column.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       If you reduce the mountain lion numbers, then hunters will pay for the deer licenses which pay for the game departments in the scientists to manage the wildlife sea. We have balanced California is him balanced. It's out of balance because of the lie of the animal rights that have effect how the wildlife officers of this country, except that bullshit is just a crime. They should stand up and go your wrong. This is a renewable wildlife research resource and we're going to have a season on it because now we're killing them as damage control. They're still dying. We're killing them. We're taking millions of dollars to compensate the Lama and the

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       Alpaca and the cattle and the sheep and the goat and the horse. We're millions of dollars compensating and then we're going to kill the lion and bury it. No, you don't get to eat it. No. You don't get to spend any money and provide game department, finances. No. You don't get to go to hotels and travel and food and lodging and supplies and sporting goods and taxidermist. You don't get to increase the economy of the entire area because of one mountain lion hunt. We're going to take your tax dollars and compensate all the dead livestock and then we're going to hire a guy to kill the mountain lion Joe. Dig a hole, which by the we're going to take your tax dollars to hire a guy with a front loader, dig a hole and bury. Don't put this magnificent animal public perception. It's because of the average person like you saved precept chunks.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       I have dogs. It's not perception. It's ignorance and it's this perception that does come from ignorance is that we love animals. Like I have a dog. You have dogs. I've lived for my. Yeah, I have three dogs. We love dogs. Can't live without them. You go home, you pat them. People that don't have any interaction whatsoever with wildlife. Think of animals like they think of their dog. I don't want anything to document and then you hear about a mountain lion like, oh, why would you kill them? Outlined mind you're being cruel, like you would only kill them. Outline if you're one of those dickless assholes and once I go to Africa and shoot a line and the head mounted on your wall just because. But this is the thought process behind it and there's no pushback because the public speaks and then I pushed back in the attack.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       They attack you bring it on, bring it up because ignorance bounces off of me. Like personal hygiene from Michael Moore. It just has no impact whatsoever. I think he washes you don't think God what a. What a swine. He. That's a subhuman Mongrel. If I ever saw I met him, he was in this guy. He's a prick. He's a liar. What do you think? He's a scam artist. Like gun control. Well, how about the fact that he put together that move, that so documented that Hollywood actually gave them an award and he copied and pasted out of sequence the attack on the grid. Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow responsible for the little child killing herself with you're paroled felon, father's gun, and they put it out of sequence and attributed. Charlton Heston defending such irresponsible gun ownership. Michael Moore is a line, cruel, stoned punk, as he stoned constantly all day.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       All the time. I think he used the suppositories. I don't know him. I do and I. He's a punk. Has He ever had a conversation? Got. Yeah. I was on his TV show and I was responsible for ending his TV show because he tried to fuck with me and I don't know if you'd noticed you, but I'm unfuckable you. Fuck with me. I'll eat your family tree and shit. Saw dust into your face. Ask Pierce Morgan. That seems like I saw your compensation. Not even close. I was arm wrestling a torso. Well, the Pierce Morgan. The problem is he didn't understand the facts. When you talk about gun violence, he didn't understand how much of guidelines. In fact he knew them. He avoided

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       him. That's true. Absolutely. Plus, we explain what we're talking about because when you say the numbers of gun violence, a giant percentage of murder suicide, a giant percentage of them are cops killing bad guys and citizens defendant. So all of those are out of the. And then accidental gun deaths may have summarized it for you. So Pierce Morgan fancies himself a cookie, rather woody limey usually got the accent and everything. It's funny little Matt actually an accent. It's an impediment. But, uh, he came out and of course he's going to take on the motor city madman. I mean this guy is going to be easy pickins. He actually wrote Wango tango be all intellectually this thing you're doing, that's the limey. You've got manufactured confidence based on nothing except an ego that has no foundation. In fact. So Pierce Morgan, the CNN exec, so when it's put Pierce Morgan on the Motor City Madman in a gun store to the first time you didn't see the first one at the CNN officers, that's the best thing.

Speaker 3:          01:53:46       Both of them, that's the best one. And so they think I'm a dirt bag and in a goof ball because I not only wrote Wang Dang sweet poon Tang, I meant it, but when they take me on they don't realize I never went to college because I was too busy learning shit. And if you take me on, on any subject that I am even slightly aware of, I will fuck you up because I've studied this stuff. I've lived this stuff. I've been with guns since I could walk. I have had universal unlimited access to fire power my whole life, both in a recreational, a disciplined, a law enforcement military training, and just a family plinking competition. So when every considerable, a imaginable gun use, I've been 68 years of it. Um, so they sick Pierce Morgan Ami to teach me a lesson about how irresponsible gun owners are and that if we could just ban guns, that all the violence would end.

Speaker 3:          01:54:52       And of course, if you haven't seen it, you got to google it because it was his. What's his take? Well, I've, I almost fixed them, um, because I so overwhelmed them with evidence that they finally research and realized that every word out of my mouth was absolutely indisputable. What was most compelling that you were saying to him? I'll, I'll summarize it this way. Like I did the pierce. The anti gunners have their dream. It exists. It existed in a Paris where all those people were shot with coalition of coughs, coalition to costs were banned. They have their dream. Pierce morgans dream exists. It's called a gun free zone. Virginia Tech, Columbine, Sandy Hook, Aurora, Parklin every instance where the most innocent lives have been,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       had been a Nancy Pelosi, maxine waters, Eric holder, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama's dream. Their dream is a gun free zone, but we're free. People are forced, forced into unarmed helplessness where the most innocent lives are lost and that dream has produced more carnage and destroyed lives than anything in the world compared to the NRA convention where you have the highest incidence of gun ownership or opening day of deer season in Michigan where you have 100 percent gun ownership and access where nobody gets hurt. So if you know that your dream is a gun free zone and that's where the most innocent lives are lost, what kind of demonic dirt bag would actually want more?

Speaker 3:          01:56:31       Well, let me stop. Let me stop being kids position or anybody's position. On the other side. You would say the real gun free zone would be no one having access to the gun that killed those people in the gun free zone, a gun free zone, and the real and the real answer to drownings in America would be the band water. And you work on banning water. I'll work on banning guns and we'll touch base every few weeks and see how you can not banned. You cannot eliminate guns. Finland, you cannot eliminate guns. Uh, Alberta Canada, where the guy who came into the University of shot everybody up. It's impossible. So what you do, instead of thinking you could ban water, learn to swim and watch your children by the pool. Call me weird. But the way to handle violence is to carry a gun practice with it. And when someone brings lethal force against you, shoot the motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          01:57:25       But people are very uncomfortable with the idea of any society, comfortable babies. Sorry, you're uncomfortable that go ahead and bend over and die. But you know what I'm saying. I know what you're saying, but wouldn't it be better if there weren't any concern that the. The, the idea is to somehow enter the takeaway, the concern of people being shot randomly by some psycho that you've got to figure out if you get all the guns away, how do you get all the guns away? Oh No. I don't know. But this is what I'm saying is that you don't know. So let's just start. If they're not, if it's not that, then everybody's got guns to shoot. Nobody. Everybody will not have guns. Some people have guns.

Speaker 2:          01:58:00       Some people here. I studied San Bernardino. I studied at Aurora. I started at Virginia Tech. I studied columbine. I studied sandy hook. I studied them all. Do you know joe and everybody better write this down because I'm the only guy that will tell you this. I've studied the cadence, the bullet manufacturers, the rate of fire, the movement of the purpose, and the movement of the victims. In every instance, including in Connecticut, including Aurora, including San Bernardino, right here, there were American citizens who would have had a gun on their person if they were allowed to and they could have been a meaningful force to at least reduce, if not terminate the violent murderous threat, but by law we have been so dumbed down and so forced against our natural survival instinct to have a tool on our belt that in every instance where the most innocent lives were slaughtered, those people that would have intervened with a firearm.

Speaker 2:          01:59:07       Not many of them, but there was a janitor. There was a couple of guys in the office. They had concealed weapons permits, but they weren't allowed to have in that building. In Virginia Tech, there were guys that had concealed weapons permits, but they weren't allowed to have them there in Aurora, Colorado. Are you kidding me? All kinds of people would have had guns. They could have returned fire, but they were forced into unarmed helplessness. Here, here's the gun debate. In it's con, irrefutable conclusion, if you are forced into unarmed helplessness, you are unarmed and helpless. What a horrible, irresponsible, suicidal condition that in. I'm just a guitar player, Joe. I've never been on armed since I graduated from high school. I've always had a hanky and a pocket full of guitar picks and a pocket knife and a belt knife and built tool and a pistol and some extra bullets.

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       I just have them everywhere I go. I've never been on armed. I find it. How do you travel around? I improvise, adapt, and overcome. I luckily I helped pass house resolution to 18, which means all sworn law enforcement officer allowed to carry a gun nationwide. I've been a sheriff deputy since 1984 and my credentials allow me to carry a gun everywhere I go and I carry a gun everywhere I go. In fact, even in England, uh, American law enforcement are allowed to carry guns and I carry a gun over there. It's just a tool. If somebody comes up and we carry a gun in England. Yeah, eat some dirt bag. Comes at me with a spike in the board. I'll just shoot them, but why not? What's plan b?

Speaker 4:          02:00:45       No, I. I agree that it's better to be better, to have it and not need it than to need it and not to have been. The thing that we would all like to have is no school shootings, no mass shootings, no reward, no columbine, no. So how do you stop that? Do you think you stopped that with more guns? Where do you think you stopped that with mental health education, figuring out how to get people off of pills, figuring out how to keep people from living despondent lives where they want to just tear it all down and shoot everybody in her hurt a bunch of people. Well, here we are. That's the route, right? Sure. Here we are. We are

Speaker 2:          02:01:20       2018 so we can't go back in history in find the goofball from Virginia Tech and what motivated him. We can't go back there because we have failed as a society to take care of people or respond with any sense of responsibility or effectiveness to the glaring

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       danger signs most outrageously in Parkland where the guy called the cops 42 times, called the FBI three times that guys going to shoot up the school. Okay. We'll make a note of that. No, the guy's going to shoot up the school. Okay. We'll make a note of that. The guy is bringing a gun to school to shoot people. Here's his manifesto. We've made a note of that. What are you kidding me? So now if we go for them to do something until someone does something which not. No, no, it's not. I don't think it's a failure of law enforcement. I had put matter. It's just a shooting two hours ago. Oh Jesus Christ. Another one, five people are dead and multiple people are. Where? Annapolis, Maryland at a Oh, Maryland. Where no one's allowed to have a gun by the way. Maryland to a newsroom and shot a bunch of reporters.

Speaker 3:          02:02:27       How much cheese? A bit. It was a gun free zone. Annapolis newsroom shooting leaves. Five people dead. Suspect in custody. A newsroom. Yeah. Well, there's my point. So I made a newsroom and I'm ready to rock. I'd rather be sitting where you are, but I figured you got me covered. My point is is that the cat is already out of the bag, but it's not too late. Columbine guys, glaring signals, red alarms going off over Virginia Tech Guy. Red Alarms going off for years, but the columbine thing is a difficult one because it really hadn't happened before that no one expected it, but the parents walked through the garage for three years where the bomb making materials were on the table. Yeah, they weren't. The best parents guys were like zombies. These guys were like doper freaks from Bonzai Zulu land maniacs. Well, he's just. He's just different.

Speaker 3:          02:03:26       No, he's not. He's freaky. We need to sit down with this guy and get him some healthy. Aurora guy told his psychiatrist. My goal is to shoot as many people as possible and the psychiatrist didn't say anything really. It's on record. He said it in numerous visits with his psychiatrist that he had threatened his golden life was to kill as many people as possible and he's now got his new ar 15 to do it with and the psychiatrist didn't say anything. I've studied this stuff. We need to not only see something, say something, we're missing the part, the final part do something when this kind of abberant threatening violent red alarm behaviors going off. Inter veen sit down with this kid at the first instance when your kid comes home, all glassy eyed and goofy and incommunicable and showing weird signs like the sandy hook guide he had all his life and the Aurora guy did all his life and the Parkland guys.

Speaker 3:          02:04:20       I'm being all staring like a. When blinken a sandstorm, somebody go. I know I would. I mean in my life with her as musicians or family members are going, are you going to write what is going on? You look like you're going to shit yourself, man. Are you okay? Didn't have that conversation with somebody like the psychiatrist did to the Aurora shooter. Didn't mean how do you fix these people? I mean, what you're saying is if you have no gun free zones and people allowed to have guns, at least they'll have an ability to defend themselves. I agree with you. I agree with you on that, but how do you stop it from happening in the first place? The anti gun people say the way to stop it is to have no guns available to civilians that can do things virtually impossible. A porsche. So what we're dealing with just pragmatically, when you look at 300 million people and probably 400 million guns, but you haven't counted mine yet.

Speaker 3:          02:05:11       I mean, how many guns for every guy like you that has hundreds of guns, you know, almost everybody I know has hundreds of guns. He just not like a man. I got hundreds of arrows. I have four. I have thousands of guitars. Um, we need to be a more assertive, aggressive, compassionate, aware society. And when we see these glaring indicators, we're never going to stop it all. There's always going to be a evil in our lives and you can't stop it. Hence, you should be armed and prepared. And if you're not comfortably being armed, by all means, don't be. If you don't want to. Like I saw the debate bill marcy or why you can't expect every teacher to have a gun. I go, who's ever recommended that? That's what the anti gun people always go. Why should have everybody should have a machine gun just shooting everything.

Speaker 3:          02:06:03       Yeah. That's a pretty good. That quote for quote what I recommended. They go to the deep end every time where they're trying to make fun, they try to make fun of the proposition. Unbelievable. Should be armed against killers. There are people I know everywhere. Teachers, grocery store, baggers, a name, a walk of life. My Weldon Buddy, my mechanic, my dentist, my doctor, Dr. strapped. Yes. I mean they just. They're pragmatists, they're utilitarian. They're self sufficient. What? When did that become an desirable to be self sufficient and capable? I think that's the problem. I think what we're saying is that we have such a gun problem. There's so many people in so many guns that people just want to somehow or another they do finish the numbers. Joe, we do not have a gun problem. When I was growing up, we had guns in school during the season. Rifles, shotguns were brought and put in your lockers. There was unlimited ubiquitous access to firepower throughout my youth. No school shootings, something else has happened and it has to do with big farm in the dis, the irresponsible knee jerk, a bandage on a gaping wound of a, of a child showing up at each childlike behavior. And all of a sudden they PROZAC, um, in a Ritalin. Them, this stuff turns into a Zombie. My dear, dear blood brother, cliff Davis, the greatest

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       drummer on the planet listened to what he did on the Ted nugent album and the cat scratch fever album in the free for all album. And the weekend, I mean this guy was a god of musicality. He became depressed and was prescribed. And the incidents of people being prescribed a mood controllers in emotion controllers and depression controllers. The incidents in the consistency with which they attempt to go cold Turkey and kill themselves. You, your brain becomes changed. It becomes altered. Your logic meter is off duty with this pharmaceuticals in your system. Cliff came home, decided to get off the PROZAC, walked out into the yard screaming, thrown his clothes out the window and shot himself in the head and Aurora guy, all the. They're all on something. It's true. It's at and mothers and fathers out there. Discipline is the answer, not pharmaceuticals. Conversation is the answer. Probing parenting is the answer would.

Speaker 1:          02:08:57       Like I said, when I was growing up, we had a cuckoo's business, we had a eloise and people showed dangerous and an in an antisocial behavior. You intervened and you put them in an institution and even that was a mistake because there was always a chemical response instead of a, a compassionate response to chemical to some people do or fucked in the head. Yes, you do have to do something. Absolutely, but there is the argument that there's a lot of people that take these pharmaceuticals and they have no violent outbursts, which I agree with too, but the people that do have violent outbursts are almost universally on something universe. Yeah. If you look at the numbers, and I've said this many times that I don't think we have a gun problem, I think we have a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem. Absolutely, because whether it's someone driving a truck into a crowd of people, that's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:49       Do you think, do you think after 42 calls to the sheriff's department threatening to shoot the school and three to the FBI, do you think the Parkland shooters should've been visited a little earlier than after 42 and three calls of threatening to shoot up the school? Do you think the authorities should have the right to go visit this kid, get the guns out of there, don't you think when you say, I am going to shoot up the school in my world, that would be good enough to disqualify that person from owning a gun? I agree with you. I don't know what the circumstances were with the Parkland kid and I do. I know that the FBI did visit him on one occasion. Not good enough. You. I don't know what they there. It's not like he was peeing on the Alamo and just being a dirt bag. He was threatening to kill as many

Speaker 3:          02:10:33       people as possible. That to me is enough information to disarm the guy and probably institutionalized Murray's and take him in for review to a psychiatric ward. At that point, you can't say, I'm going to kill people yet. Can't say that. Are you comfortable with a world where there's so much gun violence that everybody just has to be strapped or. No Way? The last thing I. I've said it 100 times. I'm going to say it again on the Joe Rogan podcast. Write it down. I do not want everyone to carry a gun. I do not want everyone to own a gun. I don't want everyone to hunt. I don't want everyone to have an 850 horsepower Ford Bronco. I don't want everyone to go on the Joe Rogan podcast. There is a time and place for individuality and individual choices and many people will always be uncomfortable. You know, taken a hook out of a fish's lip, so don't go fishing and if you don't feel comfortable around guns, by all means, just don't have one, but those of us that have a hint of warrior instinct and rugged boy scout being prepared, desire, don't disarm us, we're your best friend with and they're everywhere.

Speaker 3:          02:11:56       They're those teachers in all these school shootings that were teachers that would have had a gun but they were forbidden to and there are instances, and this is something that people that are anti gun don't like to talk about, but there are instances where trained shooters have stopped. Mass shootings have stopped someone killing people. It's theirs and let me come in on the train while I. As long as they get training, let's let's, let's squash that myth. Big Old fat Jewish lady in New York City back in the sixties. She was robbed at gunpoint at knife point over and over again. Remember when they had like 2000 murders a year in man. It just runaway mayhem. She was getting upset. She wanted to get a pistol and she went to the police station. I need to get permanent. Well, I'm sorry we don't give permission, but I had been robbed all these times.

Speaker 3:          02:12:41       I'm scared. He comes back all the time. A guy had his good points gun once my money. I'm sorry, you can't have a gun. So she was frustrated. This was a documented case and so she went to uncle Joe and uncle John. I'm scared. I need a gun. Guy Keeps dumps. He's gonna kill me. So uncle Joe got, I'm a row. Got Her a revolver. She'd. I don't like it. Just put it under the kind of scared that I don't like guns. Never fired it in her life. No training. Had no idea, but she knew which, which end. The bullet came out of next time she was robbed. She shot the son of a bitch. She knew what to do. She knows the trigger and the training. She one shot the guy that was threatening her life. Now they put her in jail initially. Slake, you know, Bernie gets a defendant in his life, but eventually the charges were dropped because it was clear and present.

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       She was defending herself from an engineered recidivistic write that down, engineered recidivistic the system in knowingly and intentionally lets out, knife and stabbers and rapists and murderers and child molesters. They keep letting them out. Those are the people. 90 six percent of the time that commit the violent. When you say engineered, do you think they do that because of prison? Overpopulation, lack of funds to do it because they want society to be dangerous. I can't imagine how the engineered. I can't imagine that anything is just in competence and incompetence and the fusion of responsibility for the individuals. Bureaucratic. Institutionalized irresponsibility. Yeah, and corruption and abusive party. They don't want to deal with it. Well, lack of resource. Cut them a deal. They only shot three people. Let's I get them on jaywalking. Okay. We'll cut them a deal. He only serve six years of his life sentence for killing those people.

Speaker 3:          02:14:30       I mean it happens all the time and that guys on the street and he kills somebody. Go, I can't believe it. He had an arrest record, goes back to his youth and it was 100 pages lie. I can't believe you. Let him out. Well, we let them out. We knew we killed people. In fact, he stabbed two people, but he missed the artery. So we're going to let them out and see if he can study anatomy enough and get a good stab next time that our court systems are a joke. Our prison system is a joke. I mean, if somebody stabbed somebody, do you want him? You want him on the street with you? If he stabbed somebody, you are killing that person. You're just shitty at it. If you shoot at somebody in your miss that's murder, you just, you're just bad at it.

Speaker 3:          02:15:07       If you're willing to just throw a bullet at a human being, I want him in a cage forever or better yet, dead right there. And then if he's capable of taking an innocent life, I want him out of the gene pool. I don't believe in, uh, um, uh, how did I put it in that one interview? I don't. I don't believe in repeat crime. Repeat criminals. I believe in dead criminals. If someone threatens innocent life, get him Outta here. I really believe that. And you know who the best person to make that decision is? The person that bought to get stamped, the lady bought to get raped. The gigabyte to get shot at this all makes sense. I mean, I, I feel what you're saying. I think the real problem is why does it happen in the first place? Because we're a society that doesn't respond to alarming signals in the hope of not hurting feelings instead of saving lives. It's a liberal mantra of a feel good inaction versus tough choices and harsh choices that will actually save lives. Don't you think it's also a lack of resources to. And a lack of these people that are interviewing these psychos before they snap based on that. Really, psychology based on my tax bill. Um, I think they have the resources is just mismanaged and wasted. By the way, while we're doing this, can I hit the bathroom real quick before I squirmed out of here? Can I never. This will be right back

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       and I came in here. Will stay here. Yeah. Amazing. You're walking fantastic on those robot knees, man. It's crazy. It's amazing how few people can hold their pis. Sometimes it comes. Yeah. He's got to waterstone. Yeah. He, he slammed to waters this. A shooting happening while he's on is so appropriate. I mean, it's so, uh, crazy that this, this is the time. So this is a newsroom wide. They got, do they have a motivation for this guy?

Speaker 5:          02:17:00       No motivation is being interrogated right now is what I just read. And uh,

Speaker 4:          02:17:04       it's amazing that these guys want, they get captured but they don't get killed like the Parkland kid and the, a lot of these people like how are they not killing these people when they're, when it's happening.

Speaker 5:          02:17:15       Supposedly a white guy in his twenties.

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       Is it some fake news thing? I mean, he, he shot reporters, you know,

Speaker 5:          02:17:23       until the interrogation comes out. I feel like it's not fair to say, but there are people pointing at things that have been in the news recently. Oh fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:17:32       It's just so much. I mean, I hear what Ted's saying, that you should be able to defend yourself. And I agree. Like if you were in a grocery store somewhere and some guy came in shooting and you had a gun, I would want you to be able to defend yourself. You know, I want you to be alive. I agree with you. I get that. But that's the only way. I mean. Or is it just what we have to do right now. I mean, I don't know what anybody on the other side wants other than taking away everyone's guns. But if you take away everyone's guns, how are we possibly going to do an audit of 300 million guns in this country? How are you going to find all the illegal ones? Are you going to find all the stored ones? And then there's that old cliche.

Speaker 4:          02:18:13       If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns. I mean it's almost like the same thing we're talking about when it, in terms of legalizing illegal, illegal drugs and when drugs are legal, they can be taxed and you can make sense of the situation. You can have treatment centers. The stigma of, you know, the, the, the appeal of them of doing something you're not supposed to do is no longer there and then you're not funding these illegal organizations. Organizations like the cartels in Mexico or back when it was organized crime in America for alcohol when the prohibition was going on. It's, I don't think that you're going to be able to take away all these guns, but I don't know what the argument I would like to talk to somebody who has an argument that you could do it because I know they did it in Australia, but Australia so small and by the way you can get guns in Australia. People use guns for hunting all the time. So guns are available and occasionally they do have gun violence but they had like one mass shooting in the 19 nineties in Australia and they just banned all the guns. But Australians, are there a different culture too? Like this fucking culture is gun happy from all of our movies and television shows and the solution is like bang, Bang, Bang. Like shooting people as a part of the solution.

Speaker 4:          02:19:33       You know, I don't know. I don't know, man, I just. No one has an answer. There's no one on that side. No one on this side. Every answer has holes in it. You're laughing. What happened? Our Pis, I always say, God, I love that. I always say to this conversation about guns, you know, and, and I don't see an answer. I do. I really don't. I don't see an answer. The ultimately will be like, I'm all for responsible gun ownership. I have guns, I've hunted with guns, I believe in gun ownership, but how do you stop gun violence? And I don't know. I don't know what the answer is and I think this is ultimately what everybody is trying to find. We were talking about when you were gone, the Australians were, they banned guns because of one mass shooting and they've never had a mass shooting sense, but doesn't. Crime continues to go up and down based on other social factors and there's not many of them. There's only 20 million people in the entire country

Speaker 2:          02:20:29       to address. Probably the glaring beast in the room of America. You're 50 something, 50, 50, 51 in August, I'll be 70 and I've had a pretty good writer. I got a pretty good absorption factor of information, evidence, experiences, ideas, opinions, activities, what the hell happened that would allow Americans so many of us to become so evil that we want to hurt each other and kill each other and

Speaker 4:          02:21:12       it killed children, rob in and molests so want to make the biggest impact that hurt the most people because they're hurt.

Speaker 2:          02:21:19       Doing what w, W, W, W, w, w, w where did that delineation from a post World War, two celebration of the freedoms that motivated our armed forces to defeat the worst evil on the planet, the Japanese Slaughters and the Nazi devils that it was our constitution and our individual rights that motivated these guys to fight harder and you know, it was a martial artist. You have to see beyond the contest and it's almost like you don't, you don't make your hit where you want to hit. You want your hit to go past where you want to hit. We were a united nation in 1946, 19, 47 and certainly right, 48 when I was born in Detroit was the work ethic, productivity epicenter of planet Earth, universally known. We were the war machine that built the tanks and the bombers and the planes and, and pride ownership and,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       and you got up early and you busted your ass to be the best that you can be and you kept your yard good and you kept your house clean and you earn your own way. And it was an embarrassment not to earn your own way and you save for a rainy day and you live within your means and you discipline yourself. My, my upbringing was, and wasn't poverty. I was never in need, but you couldn't drink a whole coke. You couldn't buy something because you wanted it. You needed some socks. She probably got them for Christmas. Um, and if I wanted an Arrow, I had a, you know, go to the pickup garbage and try to sell golf balls back and, and, and bought, get deposits on bottles and cans. And yeah, there was a, I was the rugged individualism, the self sufficiency, the neighborliness, the giving and caring and you know, it did take a village.

Speaker 3:          02:23:20       It started with family, but you cared about your neighbors and you watched over each other. And then I saw and with all due respect, when the beatniks and the dope and then the hippies and the disconnect and a carelessness erupted and and a meanness, I started seeing more meanness and anger and and disconnect. And then after whether it was the new deal or the great society, which kind of incentivized not being the best that you can be and you can actually stay home and get a check. And I'm the unions would negotiate not unquality automobiles but money that may or may not be there, but we'll get you some more money and you can make Chrysler's that won't even start. It can't even drive them. They're such a pile of shit. And I saw this Detroit go from this glowing epicenter of goodwill and decency and work ethic to Liberal Democrats, scamming people and bribing people for votes by getting you something you didn't know.

Speaker 3:          02:24:32       And then all of a sudden the city burned down and no age couches in the street and refrigerators on the lawns and it just turned into a lump I shit and it breaks my heart. I go downtown Detroit now and building the beautiful architecture still boarded up from the 67 riots. I took my kids down for the 42nd anniversary of the Amboy Dukes and I wanted to show him this beautiful city I was raised in and what happened to it? And almost for dramatic effect, almost like Cecil B de Mille was, you know, directing a scene for me to emphasize how deteriorated Detroit got, here's this guy in a sidewalk with his pants down, taking a dump in the middle of the after known. And I go, wow, I didn't actually hire that guy. That's really what's happened.

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       So if you allow your society to crumble before your eyes without intervening and go, hey, you can't do that. You go, hey, you can't do that. I've done it with my musicians all my life. You Go, God demo. We were really rocking last week and now you're all stoned and can't even wake you up, but don't you think that when you're talking about 1946, the United States, we were. We were all against the Nazis and the Japanese. We were united certainly that are our lives were threatened. The world's future was threatened and people felt like they had a purpose. Purpose. Do you remember? I was in. I was in New York right after September 11 and one of the credit and something happened. A friend of mine fainted and we had to call the fire department. EMT showed up and the respect and the happiness that people had when they saw the first responders, and I was like, this is.

Speaker 4:          02:26:16       This is fascinating because I lived in New York. It was, it was a high point because people had felt what it was like to be attacked to be at war. I mean that was what the attack and the Trade Center, the Twin Towers was. We were at war. They felt this and they felt united because of it, and when these people showed up to help, they were excited to see them. They were like heroes. They treated them like real heroes and I was like, this is a different feeling than anything I've had before and I had. I had to imagine that this was probably what it was like in the United States in the forties fixture in the middle of the war when people were united working together to make sure there was enough scrap metal and enough rubber and there were car pooling so that they have enough raw materials to create twine and rubber bands for the workout.

Speaker 4:          02:27:04       People felt sacrificing for the benefit of their society. Yeah, and they felt like there was something real going on. Whereas when there's no threat and no worries, I think people get lost. I think especially people with no discipline. Not Everybody of course, but some it's. There's a tendency to get lost. Then there's a tendency for people to take advantage of those people that are lost and say, it's not your fault. It's the government's fault and the government needs to pay you and the government needs to help out so wrong, but there's this very strange tendency that people have and also if I may exalt, here I am with Joe Rogan. We'd never met. I didn't know much about. Yes, everybody was bombarding me. So you got to go on Joe Rogan's guys. Reasonable, sensible, smart and funny and he's promoting hunting now and I got motherfuckers. Sounds like my boy. Let's go do this. You have to admit with intelligent, conscientious, well-formulated prioritization. Twenty 18. We can go on and on about the problems in the world. Do you know that I'm the happiest motherfucker with the greatest band, the greatest crew, the greatest family. Love my TV show and New York Times best sellers and successful to some degree and the things that I pursue my passions

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       and I'm doing your show. We're talking about important issues and I have dangerous zone people that come backstage and we raise money for charities every night. Do you know Joe that I can't find a dirt bag as well, but a pretty big circle, but you're a pretty big circle and I walked down the streets here. I go to starbucks and get a coffee. I'll go up there and they pay. They pay for it for me and I love spirit of the wild. Thanks for standing up for our freedoms. God bless you. I can't find a dirt bag. I'm sure I could, but here's the solute on a Joe Rogan Joe Rogan podcast to all those people out there that do intelligently and responsibly prioritize and they bust their ass because they're out there. There's no monster armies of working hard, playing hard shit. Kickers who sacrifice and take risks and try to start a new business and fall down in the arena and stand up and brush themselves off and get back at it.

Speaker 3:          02:29:20       Those are the people that I want to talk to right now because they're the best of the best. Don't back off friction. Don't back off discomforting encounters whether it's your kid, because I've got buddies. Kids died of fentanyl. Great families that Fentanyl Shit. God, I'll cry for Ya, and you take them in your arms and they didn't do anything wrong and they're burying the fucking kid. Did you confront him? Why are you telling me you didn't see this man? Here's my alert to people listening to the upward Ted and Uncle Joe. Bookie, look harder, be more assertive is something doesn't look perfect. Look into it, and if, if there's needy people instead of giving them money because they get probably buy drugs or alcohol and you're probably going to die if you make a donation to most homeless people are going to. You're helping to kill him.

Speaker 3:          02:30:23       Brighton there ain't going to buy good shit with it and Badger. You're elected employees. We need to have mental health facilities. What? What? What are you wasting money on? You don't need to find out the sex life of a turtle. You need to take those billions of grant money that you're blown right now for some jack off and you need. We need to address the mental health, homeless, truly needy, not the greedy, not the scammers where abled bodied, they just like to stay home. The people who have mental issues and physical issues and that Donald trump has finally got to a point in time where you can fire a veteran administration scam artists. Punk who doesn't care about the vets, doesn't show up for work in absconds on revenues that could have got a couple of wheelchairs for a legless marine. Now we can fire the bastards.

Speaker 3:          02:31:19       So there is upgrade happening. But those that do know and do care no more care. More and, and, and demand answers. Whether it's your family member. How come, how come you didn't show up at the family event? What are you doing? Are you high? Are you using? What are you doing? I think if we start family neighbors, and don't be afraid to tell your neighbor, you know, I saw your son the other day was passed out at the curb. I don't think we intervene like we did back when I was growing up. Nobody would have tolerated that shit when I was growing up. They would have sounded the alarm. And I don't think there's enough of that. Neighborliness, um, uh, uh, not being afraid to hurt feelings. Well, it's none of your business. Well you wrote is my business because you're, you're my neighbor and the guy you're shitting on my lawn.

Speaker 3:          02:32:15       I mean, I don't think we're aggressive enough. I come from a world of aggression, not, not being a prick about it, but asking questions. At some point you might have to shrug your shoulders and go away. He doesn't want any help. There's nothing I can do, but I tried. Well, you'd like conflict. You Do, you do. I like to eradicate it. I like to intervene to reduce. Clearly, you know that the way you express yourself is entertaining, but it's also polarizing like a lot of things to say, you know? Sure. You invite this sort of. Not intentionally. I think by being a pragmatist you're going to invite conflict because some people don't like to hear this shit. Yeah. Some people don't like to hear this shit, but the style in which you talk like even when you're debating Pierce Morgan, you're very, very powerful with the way you describe things and you, you, you get people that want to argue back with you.

Speaker 3:          02:33:04       It's time for that because I think the gentleman's approach, Mitt Romney and John Mccain, you didn't represent nothing. The reason Donald Trump won is because finally the shit kickers who worked rough and tumble those construction guys outside the four seasons. I stayed at the four seasons. How cool does that. They're busting their ass to getting approved and they're working hard and to go throw back a few beers and have a little barbecue at night. These are the guys I'm talking about and talking to and they're the ones who voted for Donald trump. Finally because he came out, he wasn't afraid. He sounded like a shit kicker. Really sounded like them. Sound like us. Yeah. There's a. There was a real problem that we have in this country with people that are career politicians and he was really the first problem. Career politicians is the problem. The status quo.

Speaker 3:          02:33:54       That's, you know, Donald Trump isn't perfect. I liked imperfect, imperfect, just cool you and me. Good examples, but he came in swinging a crow bar to this horrible status quo that can best be described as one of. He's not presidential. You're goddamn right is not presidential because all these presents presidential guys got us into this mess because there were so cautious and they didn't want to ruffle any feathers. We want have a big tent, including all the bad guys and people that don't believe in secure borders. What is that? And people that don't believe in earning your own way. What's that? People that don't know the difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration. What's that? So the shit kickers. Finally her saw somebody busted the status quo. You're damn right, he's not presidential. Presidential got us into this train wreck and we're done with it. So the Republicans better be paying attention because if you're status quo, we were not voting for you.

Speaker 3:          02:34:48       If you come in swing, you don't have to be rude enough to be screaming, don't have to be condemning, but you have to be honest and forthright and sound like somebody. You'd have a beer with it, a barbecue, and if you sound like a shit kicker and one of us working our plane out Americans and you address our concerns will vote for you. If you don't, we're going to stay in our tree stand in November, which is what happened traditionally. That's why Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania with 800,000, 100, one it for trump because we are a hunter's nation and those families were a huge voting block. They'd never felt like they had skin in the game. Finally, somebody had skin in the game, including my teamster buddies, my union buddies, instead of just like puppets pulling that deliberately went, the Democrats had been lying to me.

Speaker 3:          02:35:31       The Democrats have been scamming me. I'm voting for trump. He's a status quo wrecker. Yeah. Was uh, when you say look, lying and scamming, what, what are you, what are you examples? Like what do you mean? Good grief. But like what? What gets to you? Like what is the thing that you, when you think of Democrats and you think of lying and how about, what do you think you need to read this? You need to cite it to find out what's in it. Nancy Pelosi on the House floor with this huge voluminous healthcare bill actually said, you don't need to read it. You need to cite it to find out what's in it. Wow. You don't remember that? No. Holy Shit. That sounds pretty ridiculous. She said it and then watch her try to form a sentence. Watch maxine water desperately searched for a syllable. Listen to the words out of their mouths.

Speaker 3:          02:36:19       Well, the Greeks. Did you see this thing that she was calling out for people to see anyone in the administration having dinner? Including Ted nugent? Yeah. Bring it on, asshole. Disrupt and cause a crowd. And tell them what you're not welcomed every. That's an insanely irresponsible thing to say. That's treacherous. Every one of my promoters have death threats because they dare to hire me. Every one of my band mates and my crew mates, some guys that are building this wonderful, uh, a bell amplifier, the, they just showed a picture on their website with me testing the new amplifier and people attacked him and threatened to kill them because they're working with the coward animal murderer or the the gun nut. I'm a gun nut. I'm also, I'm a screwdriver not to, but that's what I'm saying about you being this polarizing figure that people that aren't looking too deeply into it or listening to everything you say, but you can was thing how. How else can you address it? Because that's why I'm asking. Well, I'm telling you, you know Joe, the guys who have tried own very polite and a very nonconfrontational got us into this mess. If you don't believe America needs secure borders, you're the enemy of America. You need secure. Who doesn't know you need secure borders? Nancy Pelosi doesn't. Hillary Clinton didn't have Loretta Lynch didn't. I mean, come on. These people are freaks. America first pisses off Democrats. How can that be if it's not America thinkers,

Speaker 4:          02:37:44       think of it as you're denying opportunity to people that live in an impoverished third world country that's connected to us. Think of it as racism.

Speaker 3:          02:37:52       All my ancestors came through Ellis Island and did mine and denounce their allegiance to where they came from. You can still cook Swedish and still cook German, but you got an announce allegiance to where you come from because you're coming here.

Speaker 4:          02:38:09       Of the habits pages per night, fucking hard for someone to come over from Mexico and don't you think that the real problem is that Mexico sucks or they parts of Mexico sock overall. You figure out a way to help those people. Really the only way would be to make Mexico so healthy and and and a great place to live. That it's just like the United States. There's no reason to come over here and certainly we have tried. Our policies have been very generous to those countries were in fact we're the only country that has been generous to them, but the massive. Yeah, massive corruption.

Speaker 3:          02:38:42       Hire Mexican, Guatemalan. All those governments are as criminals. Al Capone in Chicago and 32. I mean, so infested by the law enforcement is the cartel. The military is the cocktail, so where do you next? We have the right to secure, but this is not my opinion. We in America have the right and the responsibility to secure our borders. If you think otherwise, your dangerous. We need to break. I want people who need a better quality of life. I welcome them. I got buddies that came like that, my, my sound man, frank went through the seven year process from Germany and now he's illegal citizen in America. Why should someone be able to swim across the Rio Grande and circumvent all that process so we know whether you're going to be an asset or a liability. It's not rocket science. It's liability or asset. We want assets and that's why our immigration system is horrific.

Speaker 3:          02:39:47       Even the legal one, so I know it's a problem, but we're putting all these resources and man hours into securing the poorest border instead of processing those who legitimately would like a better quality of life in America, but first they have to. We have to differentiate between the protesters who think that we need to turn over California and Arizona and Texas back to Mexico so it can turn into a shit hole. Of course, left Mexico. They know it's horrible. That's why they're here. Why would you come here to get away from a Shithole and then turn the place you came to into the shit hole. We have a constitution. We have a bill of rights. You need to earn your own way. You need to work very hard if you're in the asset column, I love you. If you're in the liability column, I love you if you're having hard times, but if you have squatted intentionally as an able bodied individual in that liability column, you are a detriment to America and you should get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 3:          02:40:50       That's when you look at it in perspective. The people that are able bodied Americans that don't do Jack Shit and some poor bastard is trying to do anything they can to get here from Mexico to the point where they're literally dying and hydration in the desert. Yeah, and they would bust their ass if given that opportunity. So it's not fair. It's not easy and it's never going to be easy advocated, but. But it is doable. But our priorities as a government are so clustered. There's so just prioritized that all this efforts going towards securing the Rio Grande when people are illegally swimming across and jeopardizing their very life and limb when just down a couple of miles. There's a legal entrance and it might be a pain in the ass, but you're here with me today, June 28th, 20, 2018. Have you not put up with major pains in the ass as a martial artist, as a comedian, that's a tough life.

Speaker 3:          02:41:47       You got your world carved out because you put up with a pain in the ass and you. Oh, you improvise, adapt and overcome. It makes you happier at night. It was very fortunate. I was born in America. I, you know, I didn't grow up in an impoverished crime ridden community. Understood to deal with gang violence, but you're certainly not advocating them coming in illegally. No, I just think there's gotta be. There's gotta be a better conversation about this and I think that the conversation is that if you oppose these people that are illegal, immigrating illegally, immigrated into this country, that you're a racist. So is what's going on right now. My Bass player, Mark Mendoza's, I'm Mexican and my bass player, Johnny gunnels, a black guy, but it's simple to call people racist. Like people love to do that. They love to reduce you down that, but it's cruel.

Speaker 3:          02:42:36       It's, it's ignorance. It's a denial of nuance. So that's a, that's a tsunami of accusations against me. And I've always made it perfectly clear throughout my 70 year life, I have always judged by content of character, never by color of skin. I have to admit there is a racist element in me because I'm going to expect a black guy to be able to play better groove than a white guy that has been, uh, had been overruled over the years because there's so many white guys that learned from the black masters that now it is raceless. But in growing up, I always figured the black guy would be a better musician. I'm in a racist against white people in the early days it was that way. Um, but nowadays we learn from those black soul artists that were the consummate definitive authority of emotional music from the James Brown, the funk brothers and chuck and Bo and little Richard and bb and Freddy and Albert and Ali's monster black heroes of everybody's.

Speaker 3:          02:43:39       And there's not a musician in the world that won't admit that. But now, because of that influence all these years, uh, the white boys, um, can keep right up there with them. In fact, in many instances, a compared to a lot of the rap and the hip hop, um, there's a whole lot of white guys out there. I think a job on a Masa and Anton Fagan, certainly Jason Heartless and Greg Smith and all the guys narrows Smith and Zz top. I mean, you close your eyes and there's not a Caucasian to be found in these bands nowadays soul wise. So yeah, it raised the, the, the, the repugnant. I'm dishonest. Charge of racism is completely. It's one that you can't shake. Just somebody calls you a racist and heat it, but people have called you a racist. Everybody, everybody with a heart and a soul knows I'm not in a, you have, you know, you know who the racists are.

Speaker 3:          02:44:34       People that call me a racist. Those are the racists while and dirt bags to be. It's just, it's an unfair thing to do that people like to do because it automatically puts you on the defensive. You're automatically on your heels and you have to defend this charge against raising by proving you're not a racist, which makes people suspicious that you might be raised and Speidel. Yeah. I'm just, I just live a great life with great people and race, creed, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender, confusion matters. What do you think about that? I think, I think Caitlin, I think Caitlin, because I beat him in all the races we raced against. That's what it is. I pray for Bruce. Katelyn. Like, what a great guy or a girl. Now I will, if that's what he said, if that's what she likes. It's a weird one, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:45:26       Where was this when you were a kid? Yes. It's, it's, it's a different arena of thought. Um, and only she can make that choice and you have to respect that choice. It, it's mind twisting, twisting in. Anybody says it's not, it's not being honest, but, uh, it's, it's very strange. Diane Sawyer. God love her, but she had the opportunity of a lifetime when she was interviewing bruce and he was saying, you know, for all practical purposes, um, I'm a, I'm a woman. And she said she should've said, yeah, except for the Dick. But I raced against her if she did say I wish like that man. Uh, but I, I, I got to be friends with Bruce. He was the god of manliness. Yeah, the gold medalist on everything. It was just the, the baddest motherfucker hurdled the earth. And I raced with them in off road races and stuff and I always beat him, which was just shit luck because I was more aggressive.

Speaker 3:          02:46:26       And uh, he was a great guy and I spent a suspect. He's still, she's still a great gal. Yeah, I mean, I, I respect everyone's choice to do whatever you want as long as we're reading people. And that fills right into that category. Absolutely. How many people have come to you that you run into in, in all your, your, you know, your circles and musicians and the son of a bitch, like, curious about hunting that didn't know where to start because that's one of the things that comes to me a lot. People like I want to get it. I have so many comedians is great, isn't it? Yeah. And they don't know how to get started. And I'm like, man, I wish I had the time to take you, but I don't, I barely have enough time to go myself. I've witnessed you articulate it and you're doing a great job and I thank you for that and I salute you and you've made great progress in inroads in that arena of ignorance and a presumptuousness.

Speaker 3:          02:47:15       But I'm very blessed because I'm a loud mouth and I'm alive. I mean I'm engaged. I exercised my duties as we the people to talk about policies and getting the face of my elected employees and hold them to constitutional accountability. And I'm like, I missed the concord bridge. So I'm here doing this now. And I in my everyday walk at the Sushi restaurant at the gas station, at the feed mill, at the charity event. People always coming up. And those that would hesitate, I guess never showed up because I never felt any hesitation. They're always genuinely intrigued. And they express, um, confusion and uncomfortableness, discomfort with the concept of killing game. Uh, but within minutes when I talk about sustained yield, habitat carrying capacity, just simple, readily understood earthly logistics, um, they go, I never thought of it like that before he, even, whether they're going to have babies next year and there's not going to be any new ground, we're going to have to grow next year as wildlife on the existing habitat and in most cases reduced habitat.

Speaker 3:          02:48:29       But thank God the cougars can live in your backyard and the bears can live in the Culdesac and Pennsylvania and coyotes that live in your bathroom if you don't lock the door. So wildlife has adapted miraculously. I mean geese and ducks and turkeys and deer and elk and bear. They're literally everywhere. Check out, uh, at estes park in Colorado. I mean their, their landscaping, destructo derby. So we don't need to worry about encroaching on habitat because they will adapt and they have wonderful. And again, more deer, more elk, more cougar, more bare, more tricky, more geese than ever in recorded history. And we're slaughtering them by the gazillions every year because they growed gazillions every year. And once I expressed it to people like that, and then I inject the, the inescapable truism you talk organic, you talk close to the earth quality, real food. Is there something better than venison eye?

Speaker 3:          02:49:29       Because if there is, I want some of this conversation is what I'm talking about. People don't know how to get started. They hear about that and there's all this talk about organic and you know, close to nature and being connected to your food, but they don't know how to. It's pretty easy to start a garden if you have a yard, but to, to start hunting. That's a great barrier to entry there is. But it's easily overcome. Um, and go again, go to my facebook. I mean not just to be made my facebook, but I am the, the glow worm of the hunting lifestyle. I mean, people have always come to me for that because I've always promoted it and I've never backed down and almost every interviewer brings it up since the 19 sixties because it was the tip of the culture work. Controversial spear.

Speaker 3:          02:50:15       It really was hunting and guns. Those are the tip of the culture war from the beginning because people were moving from urban self-sufficient, hunting, fishing, trapping, earthly lifestyles to the city where they were catered to and they didn't hear the chickens squawking, so they didn't feel responsible for its death. Right. If you haven't caught on blue era killer, yeah. That is the problem. When I, when I expressed that, they go, hey, you got a point there and I went, yeah, I think so. I use blunt street term nomenclature and easily identified colloquialisms of of modern terminology that is timeless and it it registers with them quickly now getting over the hump to have access to hunting ground. I also have been effective in educating people on that because everybody's got an uncle Joe. Everybody's got access to some state or federal open ground and even though the hunting isn't very quality on those public areas, oftentimes if you are willing to pursue what should have inspired you to ask about hunting and that means to go beyond the beaten path, which is part of the spiritual experience.

Speaker 3:          02:51:28       Leaving the modern Kush and getting into a wild area. I find that a lot of my new, uh, baptized hunting, young, old and otherwise, that they like going deep and they will find that deer that's not on the fringes of public ground, that have already been so pressured that they moved into the anterior nucleus of more sanctuary habitat. And these guys, it's almost cry. They're so happy. Even if they didn't get something because I got in there and it took me two hours to get in. There was still dark and I was concerned about my safety. I'd never been that deep in the woods before the manistee national forest

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       in Michigan or any wild ground. Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, California. And they said, you're right, ted. It's changed my life. Just watching that deer come down. I forgot to draw my bow. So it, it, it's an immediate alive snus that is rarely available in a modern setting except for great family times. Birth, death, sex, laughter around a campfire, primal moments, primal, primal moments. Yes. I call it a prayer for the wild things. I actually wrote this in the New York Times, way back in the, uh, I guess it was the eighties. I wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine feature about my Christmas Buck and I've written it in all kinds of places and I'm amazed that people still question whether I'm serious about hunting or not. I bet you kidding me. I've written New York Times bestsellers and the number one showing up your channel for 30 years almost. Who questions whether or not you're serious about hunting?

Speaker 1:          02:53:13       Yeah, I did. Someone actually questions? Yeah, just did not sure what it's all about. Um, well they don't know what it's all about. Being receptive to my statements are just a, how can you not? How can you avoid them? I mean there's many people that would hear about you and then immediately go, oh, fuck that guy. I heard him talk sit. He said fuck. And he called somebody a motherfucker. Shit. He did something. And you've never been on the street. Really the street. You've never been on the street. You've never heard this language before. You lying sack of shit. Being this polarizing guy though, does it get exhausting? Like so many people hungry in Tom faker rating. You don't get tired of constantly doing well in battle with people, but I don't, I don't do battle. I merely put out the truth, logic, common sense, the science.

Speaker 1:          02:54:00       It's irrefutable. It's not my opinion. I have no opinion on. And I'm just genuflect at the altar of truth, logic, common sense of science. And I share it. And if you can't grasp it, you work on it. And I'm here if you need me. Um, but you clearly like it. You liked Pierce Morgan interviews? Yes. Because without me, who's going to do it right there lies will stand their, their, their dishonesty. And they're mean spirited. Well, why do you think they have these low? Why do you think a good cause? There's. Morgan does. He's been so removed. They are so satisfied that they say five. They think their cord on blue didn't die. They think that their pulled pork sandwich came like that. And, and within just minutes, an honest person will admit that they're Tofu. Salad has a whole bunch of dead ground squirrels and it's vapor trail.

Speaker 1:          02:54:57       And, but unless they're, unless I tell them then what nobody else can I tell them, well, another thing that's a big spot, if they don't understand where conservation money comes from, when you talk to them about the Pickman Robertson or talk to them about how many billions of dollars every year and generated from sales of ammunition, hunting gear, bows and arrows and all that stuff. We selfimposed that the hundreds before our time. But yeah, the hunters. There wasn't before my time, but yeah, it was that. Well a 30 the dingle Robert Pitchman, he edited. It was almost a Teddy Roosevelt thing, but the real battle cry was in my lifetime. We. There was no anti hunting. First 10 years of my life. It was the concrete jungle citification removal from the system by which we are sustained. That was a convenient disconnect and you could deny it because you didn't hear the animals die, didn't see the blood.

Speaker 1:          02:55:56       It was nice and cleaned up in the little cellophane package. And then this is new over the last few generations and that denial metastasized into a cult of make believe and fantasy. But to their credit, and there is only a lunatic fringe, I don't believe that the animal rights, even though they've succeeded, and in California, they are run into dead end brick wall everywhere else. Even though in Michigan the dirtbags succeeded in banning the hunting of the number one game animal on planet earth. The morning dove where we grow more doves in Michigan than all the quail pheasant, woodcock and grouse combined. That's a weird one, right? Because Doug's been people who've never eaten, dove. They don't know the delicious. And you hear about a dub, you go, wait a minute. That's piece. You can't shoot p. This is. This isn't an analogy of everything that's wrong in America, you're killing piece.

Speaker 1:          02:56:46       You're killing piece. But what is a lunatic fringe though? It really is a lunatic fringe. It's. It's a convenient opinion because it seems like it's sensible. Yeah. You're shooting a dove. Why would you shoot a dove Ted, and you're like, listen, I'm going to cook up some dub for you. And then you tell me why wouldn't shoot it up? Is it okay to shoot a chicken? It's not okay to shoot a dove. Why is it okay to shoot a pheasant is not as you have much to pragmatic joe and watched the logic. You might hurt somebody. Conversations don't take place. Thank you. Thank God you've been baptized because this has a great impact because your average listener does not come to hearing haunting truth. Your average listener comes to hear smart ass a dialogue in issue review and intellectual analysis of life's experiences. All good, all perfect, but that you have inflicted and injected the truth about conservation wise use wildlife management is a Hallelujah moment, which is why I'm sitting across from you today because I value that and a lot of it I got honestly from people like you that were enthusiastic about it.

Speaker 1:          02:57:52       That got me curious. When I saw how enthusiastic you are about hunting and about the eating of wild meat and how much energy it gives you. I got very curious many years before I ever started hunting because because I. I saw a lot of those p to videos. We see these horrific conditions in factory farms and I didn't want to be a part of that was trying to figure out how to not be a part of that and so when I first decided to start hunting, but before that I was making two decisions, either I'm going to do this and I'm going to hate it and I'm never going to do it again and I'm going to be a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter, and the moment I shot that deer and then we ate it, I was like, oh, I'm doing this forever.

Speaker 1:          02:58:29       Metrics. Zuckerberg actually came out and admitted that if he's going to eat flesh, he's going to kill it himself, but he did it for a whole year and everything he ate, he killed. You know, and I think that people would have a better understanding of what their food is and when you have these conversations with people, when it talks, when it comes to animal rights ideas and what shouldn't, shouldn't be legal 90, what, five 97 percent of the people eat meat. I mean, it's a crazy number. It's our life support system. Proteins, food and people will think you're just going to stop that. Listen, you're going to get a lot of people that aren't healthy. This is not the way to go, and if some people want to go vegan and they can pull it off with careful studying of their diet and making sure they're supplementing with all the right things, good luck.

Speaker 1:          02:59:13       Go. Go for it. How we can initiate this conversation. After my great hero, Fred Bear, died in 1987. It was the next year I started the Ted nugent camp for kids, which was a a movement forward of what he told me to continue promoting conservation and hunting the way I was, so I started a charity 500, one c, three church did the Ted nugent camp for kids where we run in Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa. Every year we graduated over 16,000 boys and girls between the ages of seven and 17 from great volunteers, men and women from every measurable walk of life that I have to vet because it's got my name on it, but a great heroes of law enforcement, military and just great families and we teach them the discipline of archery, the discipline of wildlife management colluding. If you don't fish upon the fish will, if they'll overpopulate and they'll die off that you have to harvest a surplus to make room for the next productivity and trapping the importance of trapping that that's how you keep disease under control and that's how you keep value to fur bearers.

Speaker 1:          03:00:16       And that's how you make really great, great warm clothes and at laterals and fly fishing and the meticulous detail and discipline of tying flies and being clean and sober and being the best that you can be. And self sufficiency and rugged individualism. So this has been going on since 1989. And, uh, still you haven't read a word about it. New York Times. You haven't worried about it anywhere because they're too quick to condemn me because I'm so good at promoting hunting gun ownership that they. They avoid me like the plague, but the real tragedy is that outdoor life field and stream sports, field guns and Ammo, all of these sporting publications, not a word, 30 years

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       of a wonderful charity created by a household name celebrity about the most important things in life. They just don't care. It's so. I'm mentioning it here on the Joe Rogan podcast because my volunteers have been doing God's work for all these years and plus people have been very generous to Shukar Safaris, donate money every year and people just dig deep and make donations to keep the camp alive. So if people want to find out about that, then go to my website, but it's a charity for children about being aware of resource stewardship and hands on boots on the ground. Environmentalism. If you're going to cut a tree, you might want to plant 50 simple. I know you do a lot of that. We do a lot of that tree planting and you've. You've done every year since [inaudible] 69. I've got forest in Michigan. I mean giant towering forest. It's fun to kill deer on your own grads fund to kill deer anywhere.

Speaker 3:          03:01:55       It's exciting and it's challenging. It's all the good things both to me to do it on your own ground that you earned. It's really special, but when you do it on the ground that you earned and you literally built the forest, it's, it's, it's spiritual. It's almost like. I love aetate when I'm in my forest. Well, I remember you had, I don't remember who it was. He had some rock and roll guy on your, uh, Sebastian Bach. I think one time it was one of one of the guys. But you were, you were talking about how someone was saying, this is amazing. I wish I had my own thoughts. Was Great. Yeah, it was that. That was Steven Tyler and Joe snored in your own forest. I said, you snorted the upper peninsula. Who are you kidding? And they did you add a mine here? He could have bought one hell of a nice ranch.

Speaker 3:          03:02:40       He would admit that the life that you live that life, uh, having this, uh, you essentially live in an area in both places when Michigan into taxes, you hunt in your own environment, you have your own hunting place, but it's controversial. And this is what's controversial about it. The fence, well, the, the Texas property is fenced because I have exotic, so by law in why do I have it fenced whatsoever exotics, because if it wasn't fenced with exotics, exotics would have probably been extinct by now, but land owners in Texas, we took the lead from South Africa and a lot of people don't know this Joe. In fact, I articulated in an upcoming spirit of the wild show, high fence hunting saved wildlife in Africa because the, the development of agriculture in Africa was in total conflict with the migration of wildlife. We're talking all those incredible species from Eland and Kudu and GMS, Bach in Yallah and willdabeast and, and, and, and the wart hogs.

Speaker 3:          03:03:39       And in elephants, they would migrate every year and have Gulf sudden the migration came to your citrus grove and destroyed everything. You had killed all the wildlife. Because you want to sell your citrus. Well, some of the ranchers who value the wildlife more than citrus and there's nothing wrong with citrus. They literally said, God dammit, everytime I herds migrate, only a portion of them come back because they all these agric concerns are destroying, killing the wildlife to protect your agriculture. So I'm an offense my 20,000 acres and I'm going to manage it. Twenty thousand acres is huge. Even my spirit world, ranches, 300 acres, it's still has a finite productivity. Every habitat is finite and so they started selling those hunts for the surplus every year of these magnificent wildlife species instead of agriculture. So those animals are thriving and absolute natural habitat as is my home, ground spirit, wild ranch in Texas, you must harvest the surplus fence or no fence and mark my words, people who condemn and criticize high fence hunting is not fair.

Speaker 3:          03:04:47       Chase are speaking out of their ass. Ted nugent hunts more days in an average year than most people will in their lifetime. I hunt hundreds of days every morning, every afternoon. The animals have to die. I must make room for next year's productivity. In your situation, in all situation, in your situation in particular because you're only on 300 acres. That's right. I have a certain amount of animals and habitat. Everybody even on outside my fence. You still gotta kill them animals too, but a lot of like purists would look at that and go, man, is that really hunting? I mean, here's my answer. Read in areas. You're ready? Yeah. Lifetime experience hunting. You know, most difficult animals in the world. The most challenging animals in the world. Pressured are my pressured animals and spirit. One ranch on my open, 1100 acres, swamp and Michigan. If I want to shoot a deer, I can 90 percent plus tell you with all my different choices of tree stands and my strategies of wind and and habitat and positioning.

Speaker 3:          03:05:54       Bader, no bait, just travel corridors. I've been living there. I've owned it since 1978. In fact, the one place I've owned since 1970 I. I have a like a 20 times the shot opportunity on my open ground than I do on my fence ground. My high fenced hunting and all the high fenced hunting I've ever had is, is absolutely pure fair chase is any wilderness I've ever been to from the Sudan to Alaska, to Saskatchewan, to Ontario, to Montana, to Wyoming, to northern California. It is hunting the role the fence plays is zero in my killing an animal. It only plays a role in keeping pressure outside, so I don't have to shoot that two or three or four year old buck. I can wait till he's five, but I still have to kill those fidgety dose and it's absolutely pure hunting. I understand your

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       perspective. The way the way people disagree is that the idea that these animals can never leave. They're stuck. They're stuck there so you know that they're going to be there, which is the difference between that and like say you go into a back country hunt, you know you park your truck and the trailhead and hike in twitch and tried to do. I'm sure you do these animals, you have no idea if they're. They are not white ranch. You have no idea whether they're right, but you know, you don't have to have, I'm sure you know, you have a lot of them, right. It's just, it's a different thing to be both, but then again, it's like do people have a problem fishing in a stock pond or in a pond? It's not stocked but managed on my property so that I fish it adequately enough so that the basket to be six, seven and eight pounds, but I don't let them get stunted.

Speaker 1:          03:07:41       Same thing. Those fishing going anywhere and quite honestly in those suburban areas and urban areas and even farming across America. Those deer are there. Yeah, they are there and I have no better chance of shooting deer and spirit wild ranch and the high fence than I do hunting the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio where those deer can go everywhere except that there is a highway right there and there's a hospital over there and there's a school over there and there's a neighborhood over there and there was a factory over here. So every habitat has its limitations. Yeah. I had a conversation with someone about, um, access deer and Lanai. We just got back from Lanai. Awesome. Populated there. It's crazy overpopulated. So I said there's two irresponsible, 20,000 axis deer and 3000 people on this island. And so someone says to me, what's the challenge in that?

Speaker 1:          03:08:31       I'm like, Oh, Christ, you never seen an axis so uppity. They are white, are the most weird species this side of bungle and uh, I'm going to say mature, Kudu, these guys, Tango Bango is a huge antelope. It's actually orange with black and white stripes from the Central African Republic and Cameroon. And so they evolved to get away from lions, whereas the axis deer evolved to get away from tigers. Yup. Yeah. Just anything that lives around cats like mule deer, high country, we're just switched on or looking for Michigan deer because there's so many hundreds of either pressure from the time they're with. That's the thing about your place in Michigan. In Michigan, it's very hard to find a large, mature deer, not on our property because what I'm saying, we stopped shooting young ones and all the neighbors agree just like they did in Buffalo County, Wisconsin, which is all just decisions by contiguous land owners to not shoot young bucks because somebody shot a $200 and then when we get that, I went on my farm so they knew they were there. That's why I was so popular because deer hunting was not popular in guys were shooting six and seven year old mammoths and so the hundreds that started deer hunting went well. I'm not shooting at two year old, you know, bulger buck because joe down the road got a, got a massive stag. I'm going to wait for one of them and by waiting them they do

Speaker 3:          03:09:54       get older and they do have that mysticism of stagnant, which is better for the population because of the bad guy gets to breed geared and spread those good genetics. Talk about that to let people go. Trophy hunting takes out the best jeans. Yeah, no, it does not understand. We keep. We keep setting records for deer and Moose and elk and Caribou and bear and mountain lion and antelope every year. We set world records constantly because our hunting system of being disciplined and waiting for that mature animal are hunting system, has produced the healthiest most monstrosity specimens in the history of record keeping every year, so we're not hurting anything by being disciplined and patient, which I've learned over the years and my son is very adamant about in so many hunters are. There's A. There's a mysticism to that mature stag. The breeders of our ancestors were the best hunters and they did the breeding because they were more resourceful and more intelligently connected to the system by which we fed the tribe. So those, those killer stag hunters were always the leader of, of uh, of tribes. And in it's still that way today I'd like to think and also this pursuit of

Speaker 4:          03:11:11       bowhunting, which is more difficult and more rewarding because it's more difficult, is many levels more difficult when you're chasing after a 200 inch box. Because this is a six, seven year old animal that's been avoiding mountain lions and bears and whatever else is trying to eat it for years and years, this thing is switched on. They take very clever paths. They let the dose and the Fonz Wander on first and they laid back and typically come out around,

Speaker 3:          03:11:37       turn to come out about midnight and go back to bed around one. Now there is a variance there in south Texas where a age management was created because they they supplement and they got a center pivot agriculture down in the deserts of south Texas and that genetic is a very fortified genetic. Anyhow, 200 pound deer are not that rare. A lot of people think all deer in Texas are little, but they're not, and if you let them grow, which texts is pretty much pioneered. Those bucks in south Texas are the easiest deer on the planet to kill and there's a couple of dynamics. There's just some strange genetic lineage there that they're a calmer animal. Plus they're on wide open, vast private ground, which means they don't get the public hordes of pressure and once that book is a button buck the first year, nobody shoots at him, so he encounters. He smells that person, he sees that person, he hears that person. No problem. Second year, a little booger. Buck, you ran into people. Nobody. Nobody messed with him. Third Year she's got a nice little rack. You still run into people. No problem. There's some corn is where the

Speaker 1:          03:12:52       wheat field is the. I smelled that guy, but male, three years, he's never bothered me. I'll just keep you in fourth year, same thing. So they reduce their fear factor of the encounter with humans because nobody shot at them because they're not going to shoot him. There is that natural, but probably isn't with nappy considered. Like that's weird. It's almost like this is a pet or a farmer about that. I mean, I'm just a relaxed animal that he's not pressured, which not just relaxed but accustomed to humans. Yes. But they're still elusive. You're not going to walk up to them and club. Um, though, there are some places down there where they get so relaxed that they do hand feed some of the dose. They get so relaxed. That seems so strange to me. Well, but everybody's got their own little preference and I, I've never thought of wildlife as pets.

Speaker 1:          03:13:39       I just wouldn't own a deer as a pet. I would. You're asking for trouble and it's not natural, but if that's what you like, um, have a nice day. Well, you know, those farms, uh, the deer farms, that's one of the primary ideas of the source of CBC Cwd, right? No, they think that a lot of it comes from deere phones came from Colorado Department of Wildlife. What do you mean? Nineteen, 67. They injected scrapers, which is the sheep version of the sponge. A forum and stuff elect me into the mule deer in 1967 and they got out. That's where it started. Why did they inject? I can not imagine bureaucrats be an Asshole, I suspect. And so that is some sort of experiment. I don't know the, you know, the sheep were more popular in America than cattle. There were way more sheep and cattle until scrape. These came in, which is that that cwd version for sheep, mad cow and bovines and Crutchfield, Jacob and humans, and of course, crutchfield.

Speaker 1:          03:14:37       Jacob was a result to scientists determined by the scientists, crutchfield end Jacob, that the Indonesians, people that got this, the sponge of forum, a condition from a prion because they ate the brains of their conquered enemies. Never a good idea. So, so I'm aware of all this stuff, but believe me when I tell you live on the Joe Rogan podcast, the cwd hysteria is a scam. More deer are killed in Michigan every year by feral dogs. Then all the deer ever worldwide by cwd. I think the concern though with cwd is that it's spreading. It's not my friend Doug, his farm in Wisconsin, they're just starting to test positive for cwd know why? Because they're looking for it. Well, it's not just that they were looking for it before, but they think that it's come from animals that get out of these high fence farm operations where they all feed from the same trough and they they, they spread this from there. I think there's no evidence to support that. Dr James Crow just testified with me in front of the Michigan Natural Resource Commission

Speaker 3:          03:15:50       and Department of Natural Resources and all the exhaustive studies have concluded that cwd cannot be cross species. You can't get by eating. Person. Person can't get it. They they had on macaque monkeys get up, but that's because the injected massive quantities into the brain of a cop monkey. Otherwise they couldn't get in. But cwd Wisconsin spent $70,000,000. I'm not making that number up. Wisconsin spent $70, million dollars, tried to eradicate certain hers, which is a virtual impossibility by the way, and even if you were successful, the the mutated prion, they, they stay in the ground typically through urine and there isn't a part of plants as well. There was no evidence whatsoever that cwd is ever compromised. A servant heard it. There's been no reduce seasons even in the epicenter, the endemic areas of Colorado, Wyoming where it started, where it's the most prevalent. No seasons have been reduced, no reduced tags, no reduced in harvest.

Speaker 3:          03:17:01       It's in consequential. It occurs so rarely. They've studied the deer for 18 years in Wisconsin and deer that had cwd 18 years collared and monitored. Still having funds, they say it's always fatal. It is not always fatal. Go to the doctor, dear a slash facebook. Either Dr Dr. Com slash facebook or failure. You're not worried about it at all. Not worried about bureaucrats that have scared away hunters in Wisconsin and caused butchers to quit processing deer because of the manufactured hysteria. CWD is not a concern. Buicks kill more deer than cwd it, it, it. The bureaucrats go in and slaughtered dear by the thousands. So if cwd is killed, 58 deer in Michigan, which has, they found, um, I don't think any of them were fatal. I think they had to kill him though they did find one in Jackson County. They claim, I don't believe, I just don't believe bureaucrats.

Speaker 3:          03:18:06       Remember, these are the bureaucrats. Joel in Michigan that claimed that there were quote 5,000 to 7,000 Russian boar running wild and Michigan. Can we analyze that, analyze that claim for a moment? Maybe you can tell me Joe, what the fuck is a Russian boy? I'll tell you what a Russian boar is. It's a male pig in Russia. There is no such genius as a Russian boar. It's all wives tale bullshit. That was the official statement by a game agency in Michigan. Lions, sons of bitches and then they claim, and here's another one. So isn't it our moral and spiritual obligation to wisely use the animals we harvest, isn't it? Yes. In Michigan, the farmers can slaughter sandhill cranes, which are known as rib eye in the sky, right? It's supposed to be delicious. It is farmers and Michigan's can can shoot sandhill cranes, but by law are not allowed to eat them.

Speaker 3:          03:19:01       What is this a game department you can trust? Wait a minute, don't. I will not. Wait a minute. You heard me right? You're not allowed to eat sand. This game department is going to try to tell me about wildlife management when they claimed there were 6,000 or 70,000 Russian born. By the way, let's say there were 6,000, 5,000 to 7,000 wild pigs and Michigan back when they claimed it in the nineties. You know how many that would be today? Show me some game cameras. 800,000 deer hunters in Michigan. What are there? 10, 20,000 game cameras. It's a lie. Cwd is ally cwd as killed 58 deer in Michigan, so they claim the dnr has authorized the slaughter of tens of thousands. Who's the enemy of the deer hunter? The bureaucrats are. I'm telling you in Michigan they have lost their souls. It's a heartbreaker. I can't understand the rationale for not eating sandhill cranes.

Speaker 3:          03:19:55       There is none. What w? What are they saying? When you shoot them, you have to just let them rot bay. You have to bury. So we're shooting them as a nuisance animals that the idea, even if even if that's. That's the idea, but here's the. Here's the truth, here's the guitar tags. The guitar player will help. Okay. If there's enough sand, no cranes for farmers to shoot open the season, sell licenses, create a management plan and show some decency and respect and let us eat the rib eye in the sky. You stupid bastards. Yeah, that makes sense. Now, see, I'm confrontational now, but because I've been confronted with an offensive, a criminal law that forbids us to utilize God's precious protein. This is bizarre world that doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense that the morning who the picture of the dove on millions of boxes of Ammo in Michigan, there's a picture of a dove and it says game load, but the Michigan Dnr will say, oh no, no, no, that's a song bird. You can't shoot them and eat them. It's it's planet of the apes and it's Cooper's people that don't have any background whatsoever in wildlife for hunting as well, but that they're trained biologists. That's different. Right, and they're influenced by politicians and bureaucrats. They're liars. That question to wild boar, like whenever I go to a restaurant it says like wild boar sausage, like how do you know it was a male?

Speaker 3:          03:21:23       Why are you calling it a boar wild pig? It's. It's a sound sexy Russian bores. We have 8,000 Russian boards. What are they, gang? They're out there in the woods. Band each other. Thank God. Thank God they're all males there. Maybe that's what happened. Maybe they did have 8,000 boys and they're all going, where's the fucking check? But how can the game department use that kind of terminology? Yeah, it's a real problem with a straight face.

Speaker 1:          03:21:46       It's a real problem. Then when they, when they speak about it that way, you immediately dismiss what they're saying because you're. You're not. They're not being accurate and not being accurate with describing what the animal is and you're inclined to dismiss anything, so you're only allowed to shoot those sandhill cranes as a nuisance animal. You can't shoot them and eat them. It's unbelievable. That's crazy. And there, by the way, they're everywhere. There's plenty of sandhill cranes in Michigan to open the season in. A lot of people go. Have you ever talked to senators and congressmen? They go, well, you can't. You can't shoot sandhill cranes. I went, it's a game bird. He had dirt bag. You need to cook it for him. I watched the episode of Rinella show and they were cooking. I was like, that looks like a steak. It's time read animal. Yes. Red Meat.

Speaker 1:          03:22:27       You know, it's just tragic in California. Can Eat mountain lions. You got to bury him. He told me he didn't eat them. If you shot one with the depredation permit and the. That's right. Wow, that's. That's indecent in the animal. That's why I'm confrontational. I'm confronting indecency and trying to get some honesty involved and you can't do it by backing off and being Mitt Romney like and bring a doily to a grenade. Fight. Doily. I like to bring an eight, 10 wart hog to a poker game. Ted, we just did three hours in like 15 minutes, but I, I'd even warmed up. Just flew by right at this time. Just flew by because it's a love fest of truth, logic and common sense. Well listen, man has been a pleasure to meet. You should be able to sit down with you again and have a good conversation here.

Speaker 1:          03:23:19       My friends were right. You do deserve me and I think it's, I think it's a good opportunity for people to get a chance to see you in a long form conversation rather than these soundbites they could just choose to hate, especially when they sound bites her edited and a manufacturer has it. Let's make it perfectly clear. I did not avoid the draft. I did nothing. Oh, let's go to that. I am raising real quick. So that was an old school story of an interview supposedly that you should all over yourself and hype type. By the way, Joe, you know me pretty well in the last three hours. If I had shit on myself to get out of the draft, do you think for a minute? I would deny it. No, it was the stories out about. I went in and got my draft physical and by the way, when I win in 1969, I was superman.

Speaker 1:          03:24:05       I literally would hurdle Volkswagen bugs. I was all muscle and sinew. I could. I was superman. I was the most athletic running, jumping, gazelle known demand, and I went in for my. I didn't know anything about Vietnam. I didn't know anything about war. My Dad was a war hero, but nobody talked about it. I never heard of the Bataan death march. I graduated from the American education system, so I knew nothing and there was all protests around me, but I wasn't really tuned into the protests because I was making music every day. I mean just obsessed with the amboy dukes and playing gigs every day. And I didn't pay attention. I never watched a in my life, but

Speaker 3:          03:24:44       I was given a draft notice and I went down, I went down, I had my draft physical and I passed with flying cover colors and I got a draft card in the mail a couple of months later, uh, through my mom and dad's house. And one, why not a deferment? It's a designation. I was in Oakland Community College at the time, so it was, why was a student a designation? I believe, but I was ready to rock. Um, I didn't want to go. I didn't understand me, but my buddies were going, uh, uh, John Break, my singer had to go, uh, Rob Leonard from Amboy. Dukes had to go, uh, so the only way you could have gone as if you dropped out of school, is that what it is? No, it wasn't a deferment. No, I wouldn't, I, I would have been called anytime. So you could have been called or just weren't.

Speaker 3:          03:25:30       Sure. And then the wikipedia claims, I got a four, f four f what is a four f four F emmys. You're physically incapable. I've never been physically incapable of anything so they make this shit up. So. So I did an interview with high times, which by the way, let's make it clear. I've done this so many times that people ignore my actual statements. So I had been doing interviews all because the employee dukes were on fire and I was just an outrage on stage with the loin cloth and the bone Arrow and feedback and he's killer songs and the band was so good. Greatest musicians in the world. So I did interviews all the time talking about the music I loved and they never got anything right. These stone dirt bag hippie writers get the gas guys in the band's names wrong. They got the facility wrong, they mentioned songs we didn't perform, they got nothing right.

Speaker 3:          03:26:19       And every time I'd read the interview, God, we're talking about my music. You didn't even get the song titles right. So I started having fun with these interviewers, much to the entertainment of my band mates who would break out in hysterics when I'd make up stories because I'm not going to even try to be accurate anymore. It was an ongoing maneuver of mine. We'd have these hippie writers come in to take notes and I'd say, yeah, I played his fender stratocaster as I hold up my Gibson bird land, which was known for. And they'd write down, he played in a Gibson a stratocaster. There's no such thing as a guest. So I was having fun with dirt bag anti journalists. So now I'm invited to high times magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug. So I go in and this guy is. And so, uh, so uh, tell me about, uh, this I am boy, do.

Speaker 3:          03:27:14       What? Is it like a band? I went, yeah, it's like a band. So it's almost exactly like a bad fuck kind of question. Is this, how did this get started? Draft. So anyhow, we started talking about when I'm with the MC five and the stooges and we would. And I go, yeah man, I was snorting something. I don't know what it was, man, I just got higher than a kite. And he goes, wow, you think it might've been a crystal meth? And I went, yeah, that's what they called it. I never snorted, just made up some shit. Just went nuts. And I, we went into the war thing and I go, I don't know anything about war. I'm a, I'm a guitar player. But I went down for my draft physical and when I went into the a booth to give my urine sample, I made sure I eat Mexican food all week.

Speaker 3:          03:27:55       So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup, I took a big dump in it was green and went all over the place. And the guy went, wow, he really ain't really. And so I made up the story for High Times magazine, you know, the great magazine of good information. And uh, and then it turned out that my drummer, Kj night, God bless him, he was actually admitted this in and testified that that's what he did. We thought it was the funniest thing in the world were teenagers and this guy went into the draft physical, just an absolute near death lump of Shit to get out of the draft. And we thought it was funnier than hell. We weren't paying attention to important things in life. And so the, the Ted Hating liberal press started quoting the high times magazine and quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed that I had adopted her, that her, I adopted my girlfriend to have you read that one.

Speaker 3:          03:28:54       I did read that one. I forgot about it. So this kind of stuff, I was like, you adopted her so you could take her on tour with, you know, so I could fuck her. That's what the story was. But that's APP. Absolutely. That's how it works. That's not how I think. It makes it easy to talk to them once you adopt them. I didn't adopt anybody Christ. I never shit my pants since I was, I think eight months old. Um, I've never been with an underage girl since I was under age. I'm not a racist. And what else they said, oh, and they seem that they claim that I made courtney love blow me when she was 12. I think she claimed that. Yeah, I never met Courtney love. You can tell I don't have a rash of you gotta be kidding me. They just make this shit up because they know I'm so good at bringing my basic conservative agenda forward that they have to go full solid Linsky and lie and lie and lie.

Speaker 3:          03:29:53       And if you go to Wikipedia to find out about Ted Nugent, they will repeat these lies. They're lies. And every one of those things, every one of those things, if I had done it, I go, yeah, it was awesome. But I didn't do any of those things. Anyone can edit wikipedia, you know, very strange. Think she might have edited it yet. So it was, I'm glad we got that. So this thing is just persistent forever. Obviously it stuck in your crop because you wanted to bring it up at the very end. It doesn't take up my cross. Just. It's a fascinating example of the dishonesty and the anti journalism agenda driven. I'm anti Anti-american Anti-tech, anti second amendment, anti freedom buffoonery. They exist. I think it makes for an interesting podcast exchange. I think so. It's not in my crotch. It's not even in my universe,

Speaker 1:          03:30:40       but I notice it. It's hysterical. Ted nugent, ladies. Gentlemen, there you have it fully. Until next week. Bye everybody.
