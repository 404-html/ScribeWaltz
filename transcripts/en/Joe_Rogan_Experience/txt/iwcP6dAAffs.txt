With Ting is is a cell phone company that buys time on the sprint and the t-mobile backbone. So, um, there's two different types of signals when it comes to cell phones. There's cdma, which is verizon and sprint. And then there's GSM, which is t mobile and at and T. And with Ting you don't have to become a part of these big corporations companies to use their backbone use ting. And by using ting, what they call Wah Wah, you know, they're slogo makes mobile makes sense. It actually doesn't make sense. You save a shit load of money. If you go to ting, ill tell you exactly how much you would say save, but I believe I'll pull it up here but I think they said the average person, their bill is here, knows their average bill is $23 a month.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       Um, $440 is the average annual savings per device for a business with 11 to 20 employees.

There's no contracts, you only pay for what you use as another beautiful thing. Like if you use two minutes a month, that's what you pay for it. You use a hundred, you pay for a hundred most of the time you have plans. Like if you're with a big company and it's, you get a hundred minutes a month or whatever you get. If you go over that, you have big fees you pay. If you go under that, you don't get any money back with ting, no early cancellation fees, no early termination fees. Quit whenever you want. No ad alongs, no bundled charges, no fucking weirdness, man. Real simple, real easy. Go to [inaudible] Dot Com and you can

Uh, I was supposed to do an episode with my pal Duncan Trussell, but Duncan trussell caught what is being referred to as the nerd flu. Um, apparently when people go to comic con every year they get what they call the nerd flu. And with the nerd flu is, is people that are like, I guess either they don't get out much and when they do get out, their immune systems are severely compromised and these fucking bugs just run rampant through this sea of Dorks, something like that. Or, um, maybe it's just the factor of having so many people in a room together or so many people in groups together. I Dunno what the fuck I'm talking about, but Dunkin sick of shit. That's my point. So Dunkin couldn't make it today, but he will be back on Monday. So what I did was I, um, put up some questions are I've put up a post on twitter and let people ask me questions and, uh, I answered a few of them. And so that's this podcast. I hope you enjoy it. Please welcome me.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       All Right, ladies and gentlemen. So I am in a hotel room right now in Atlanta, Georgia. And, uh, I almost didn't make it to Atlanta. I almost accidentally went to Chicago. I've been traveling so much lately. I literally forgot where I was going. I don't think you're supposed to say literally there. Actually, I actually forgot where I was going. I went to the, uh, gate at American Airlines and, uh, you know, when they call first class, all the first class people like, Ooh, that's me. Everybody else has to wait. Well, that I was one of those assholes and I've went up to the gate and, uh, gave the lady my phone, you know, because it's a, it's in your phone. They scan your phone and she puts it down. I go, she goes, sir, this is for Atlanta. And, uh, I look up and the plane was going to Chicago and I was like, oh, dummy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       So, uh, that was made, that was one of those guys in a big rush to get on the plane that I'm not even supposed to be on. Uh, but I made it here. I love Atlanta. Atlanta is a bad ass place. It's a fun town. Uh, I did a special here in 2012 and just always enjoyed it here. It's a good city. It's an unusual city. It's very, uh, I don't know. It's got its own thing, but a lot of cities are like that. A lot of cities have their own thing. Sitting here in my hotel room, I was going to do a podcast on the plane and uh, I put it out on twitter. I said, you know, if you have any questions, I'll answer them. And I was thinking about doing it on the plane because the plane had Wifi, but there was this lady behind me with her kid.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       Oh my God. Some people just don't fucking pay attention to their kid. They just, they, they just don't, they just don't do anything. Her kid was going fucking crazy. First of all, he was kicking the back of my seat constantly, just kicking it and not like putting his feet up and resting. Just Som thump, thump, thump. He's a cute little guy. He's a little tiny fellow. He's probably only maybe two or three at the most. And I really liked kids. Um, maybe I would have been irritated if I didn't have kids. I probably would have been. But what was irritating was delayed. He was ignoring him. Um, and uh, she was lying there with her eyes closed. She was big fat lady and her kids go on. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:09:49       Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama.

Speaker 1:          00:09:53       I mean yelling. And I finally, I sat up and I turned around and looked at her and she looked at me like there was something wrong with me. I was like, Bitch, talk to your fucking kid. He's screaming at you and you're ignoring them. Some people just decide that because they have to deal with the burden of taking care of a kid and you know, kids, they have a short attention span. They want your attention when they want it. They don't want to wait. They don't have any patients. They're fucking babies. It's, it's uh, you know, two to three year old baby and she just wasn't having it. She thought she thought she should be able to just relax and that everybody else, she, I guess she just didn't take any consideration and all, all the other people around her, while her kid is fucking screaming, she's just laying there with her hands folded in her belly and she didn't like this fat belly.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       Her hands were laying on top of her fat belly and it wasn't pregnant. I don't think she had three kids there. She might've been just really into deck. She might had another baby on the way, but I think she was just fat. I'm just going to guess she was fat and this fucking kid was screaming in her face and she just kept her eyes closed. God dammit. Pay attention to your fucking kid. Lady. Um, but it was pretty evident right away. There was no way I was going to be able to get a podcast going and just talk into it without this kid screaming in the background, which I mean, might've been funny. I Dunno. I'd be more likely it would have been.

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       So, uh, I didn't do it, but I'm here in my hotel room right now it's five 20 and I have a show tonight at eight o'clock, so I've got a couple hours here to kill. Um, so I figured I'll do it here and I was going to have my friend Ian Mccall Lawn if you've, uh, Ian been on the podcast before. He's been on fight companions before and he's one of the UFC is top flyway contenders. He was scheduled to fight tomorrow, but his opponent, Justin scoggins did not make weight. It's very unfortunate because a, justin is a very, very talented guy and I was looking forward to watching that fight. It would have been a really interesting fight. Um, one of the big fights on the card that I was looking forward to, but so ian, um, wound up training for six weeks and weighing in all for nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       He decided to weigh in any way just to prove a point. Um, he fights at fly weight, which is 125 pounds. It's a brutal cut. I think he probably walks around somewhere around 150. If I had a guest and he's got a cut all the way down to one 25 and he just decided to do it anyway just to make a point because he's a professional. So, um, hopefully we'll do a podcast later with Ian. You know what, while I'm doing this, I'm doing this on my eyes. Whoops. Okay. Doing this on my iphone and I realize why I'm doing it. That I do not have airplane mode on now I do. So people can't call me cause I think if somebody calls you, the recording just stops. So it's ongoing now folks. And it's sitting here. My mic stand is a diet coke can and a, so I'm going to read some of this shit that uh, people, um, the questions people asked on, on the twitter.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       So I'm here, I'm doing the laughing skull and Atlanta tonight for two shows. It's a cool little room, but when I say a little room, I mean it's fucking tiny. I think it's a, I think it seats 80 people and I was just here a couple months ago, uh, for the Tabernacle. I was at the Tabernacle Theater, which is a big ass place and I just decided like I don't really have that much new material because really I was working on, um, it just tightening down all the material that I had for my special. And um, once I recorded a special, now I'm in sort of like a, um, I guess you would call it subject acquisition mode where I sort of sit around and try to figure out what I'm gonna, what I'm going to expand upon, like what, what ideas I'm going to start planting and then try to make them grow on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:14:17       This is the, this is a scary part of doing standup. I wouldn't say like obviously it's not scary, but this is the, the most uh, troublesome or nerve wracking or, or exciting. It's the most exciting time of standup. The most exciting is certainly like the actual filming of a special that's very exciting. And the idea that it's done and okay, I did that material, the best justice I could do and now I'm going to release it. Um, and then the most exciting part after that is this, this period that I'm at right now where I don't have shit, I don't have any new material. I have a bunch of subjects. I have a bunch of ideas that I wrote down on my phone. I have a bunch of subjects that I talked about on stage a few times, but they never really became bits. And I will eventually piece those out and I'll put those up on a corkboard with index cards to take index cards and a right the subjects down.

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       And I slapped him up on a cork board so I can look at them in my office. And A, I've got a few of those, but man, this is about as fresh and embryotic a, uh, state as my standup is ever in. It's, um, there's a period that I've been over the last few years. I've been doing it every two years. Every two years seems to be like a good number for me. Like I guess I could probably do a new hour every year, but I don't think it would be, it's at its best and some of those bits they get better as time goes on. And I would, I would love to have what I think is as close to the finished version as I can before release it. So, um, so two years seems to be the, the time that, and so there's this period where you sorta slammed down the Samurai sword, you hammer it down, get it to the, the best edge that you can get it to, and then throw it all away and start from scratch.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       So that's where I'm at, you know? So, uh, these kinds of podcasts probably help subject matter, um, is, um, it's just up in the air. I mean, I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna talk about. So let me get, get, get to some of these questions. I'm kind of rambling here. Uh, let's see what we got here. Uh, how can we help governor Gary Johnson grow on social media, etc. That's a good question. Governor Gary Johnson. I should tell you guys this. A former governor, I can't, are you always a God? He's like, you know, they say President Carter, like Jimmy Carter's obviously not the president anymore, but they still call him president Carter. Uh, I don't know how that works, but what I do know is that he will be on the podcast next Thursday with Doug. Stan hope. So Gary Johnson and Doug Stam hope together because Doug has an idea of a great idea that we're going to announce on the podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       I guess I could kind of announce it now or talk about it now with Doug's idea is, is to do a live podcast during election night and election night coverage podcast and do a series of podcasts actually live from the comedy store. So the idea is we get a bunch of different guys who have podcasts and gals and you know, whoever signs up for whoever we decided to have on it. But, uh, I believe bill burrs in, I believe Mark Marin's in Doug's in, I'm in. And what we're gonna do is we're going to do these podcasts live and either we'll all on stage at the comedy store at the same time or we will, uh, we'll mix it up and, you know, we'll have like shifts or something like that or I think it's probably going to be as, as informal as possible. So that's the deal.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       I'm uncomfortable here cause I'm sitting down in this weird way where I'm trying to lean into this microphone. I think when you get too close to these things and picks up a bunch of pops. So let me see if there's a better way to, I don't want to change the volume of this. Oh, here's another crew. So that's the, that's the answer to that. How can you help Gary Johnson? Um, I think a lot of word of mouth, you know, just talking about tweeting, tweeting about it, uh, people read your tweets, even if it's only a couple of people, they'll tweet it out and spreads, um, you know, tweet anything that you find that's interesting. Interviews of his, maybe my interview that a I did with him on the podcast. Um, other stuff that you can find him on Youtube. He's the most reasonable guy, in my opinion, running for president.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       And people don't take him seriously because he's a libertarian and it's either Democrat or Republican or waste your vote. That's like the mindset that we have here in this country. I think that this election is probably going to change a lot of that. Um, I think that what, what we're looking at right now is probably one of the worst cases of, Oh, I don't want to say the lesser of two evil. I just, I don't like it. I don't think you like, I don't think anybody likes it. I don't think that what we're, uh, what we're being offered right now is the best, the best options available. I think it's the only options because I think the job sucks. I think nobody wants that job, but Gary Johnson apparently wants it, but it's just, it's a fucked up job. And I don't want to sit here and dwell on politics and talk politics, their buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       But it just to me is one of the most depressing times ever for a picking a president. Um, steven crowder from louder with crowder. He's been on my podcast before. He just put a video on youtube about all the reasons why you shouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton. And he details all the different times she's been caught lying and not just lying about little shit lying about big crazy shit. Like the origin of her name. She said that it was named, she was named after someone who was like the first guy to climb Mount Everest. The, but something like that. Some someone to climb mount. Not, not, not that. I don't remember what it was. Anyway, uh, it turns out the guy who she's claiming she was named after did what she was claiming he did when she was six. So there's no fucking way that's true. She lied about that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       She lied about a bunch of things. She's, she lied about Benghazi being by, um, a video. I don't know if you guys remembered that, but there was a video that someone put on youtube that it was some video about Islam and it was really bad. It was like a terrible, terrible movie. Some like ridiculously bad, like amateur shitbag movie. And the word was, the word on the street for Awhile was at that movie was the motivation behind the attacks on Bengazi and it's total horse shit. And it was what the narrative was though for a while. And uh, I mean Baby Hillary Clinton didn't know any better, but either way, it's a, it's an interesting video to watch if she was, you want to watch this video and decide why you don't want to vote for Hillary. But there's plenty of videos out there that will let you know why you shouldn't vote for Donald Trump either. I mean, fuck am I rambling about here? Um, I'm being political and we have a cup of coffee here. Uh, so that's, that's the answer. Gary Johnson, if you just, you know, tell people you enjoy is that he's a fucking reasonable guy. I got hung out with the guy. I shot pool with him. He's very reasonable.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Could he survive the barrage of the, the trump, the trump ads? What do they call the trumpkins? The guys who are really into trump? I don't know those, that's how that's a fucking weapon he's got, it's like back when opie and Anthony had the pests, they would turn the pests on them, but then eventually the pest turned on them. It's interesting. Um, so that's the Gary Johnson answer. Who's fatter Thompson or Bert Kreischer that's a very good question to very good question. I don't know if you realize this, but to my very good friends, Tom Sigar and Bert Kreischer, they're both hilarious guys and they have decided to do this thing where they're calling each other fad. They're both, I love them both to death, but they both lose a couple of pounds. They could both lose a little. Um, and they've just decided, uh, to, uh, have this public thing where it's like, Hashtag bird is fat.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       Hashtag Thomas Fat. I'm going to move my phone to this new thing. Ooh, that's better. Um, and so they sell t shirts like half Hashtag Thomas fat and Hashtag birdies fat tee shirts and all the proceeds for the sales of those go directly to them. So you're not helping any fucking charities? No starving. Kids are getting fed. They're just going to buy food and get fatter. And Burt's case, he's probably going to buy boxes of wine, Burg drinks, boxes of wine in an evening. And someone's trying to explain to me how many bottles of wine that is and we don't really know. I could google that. I'm going to google that right now. Let's find out. If you had to guess, how many boxes of wine would you say? Let's take a quick, let's see, I guess how many or how many bottles rather? How many bottles of wine or in a box?

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       All right. Haley. Bottles of wine in a box. Here it goes. Um, I'm good. Before I click on it, I'm going to say, I think, I think it was nine. I'm going to say nine. That seems like a lot for bottles. Okay. Oh, no, no. Okay. Six, six and two thirds bottles. All right, here it goes. 750 milliliter bottles. How many? 750 milliliter bottles are there in a five liter box of wine. It's six and two thirds. And if it's a three liter box of wine, it's four bottles. Hmm. I bet he's drinking the six and two thirds in a night. I think he's done more than one. I forget what he said, but he's definitely drank at least one box in a night on a regular basis. So that's four bottles of wine. I would be dead. I don't know how he does it. Well, he's, he's definitely fat.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       I mean that helps it a, and then it's also, there's a, there's a tolerance issue. When you drink that much all the time you bought, your body just gets used to it. There's um, you know, your body's like, okay, this asshole is going to be porn poisoned down the hole every day, uh, time to get used to it. So that's why mythbusters mythbusters. How many bottles of wine in a box? I've been told a box of wine is equivalent to five bottles. Now I got to see if it's truth or a myth. We kind of, that's not a myth. It's a measurement is just somebody's wacky website. Um, so that's what the Bert and Tom Acoust fat thing is all about. So if you, if you see Hashtag Bert is fat, that's what that's all about. Uh, or Hashtag Thomas Fat, which is sort of a retaliation and they would call him Bert Chrysler.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       I don't know. Um, Tom's podcasts with his wife, Christina Palicki. They have this podcast called your mom's house. It's fucking hilarious. It's really funny and it's really, it's really unique. It's really their own kind of thing. I only did it once, but it's really fun. They have their own vibe. They're the, they're the pound for pound funniest couple, Tom and Christina. It's close. It's like bonding. Mcfarland. Rich Vos are right up there. But um, man, Tom, I think Tom and Christina might have them buy a hair by hair. All right, next question. Boy, some of these questions are fucking terrible. We'll the doom podcast ever happened. That's a good question. Soprano pictures. Yeah. I probably will. Um, as just been crazy busy. Um, editing the comedy special right now and when that's over I'll have some rest and relaxation time and yeah, we'll probably, but we're going to do is it probably won't be like a regular podcast because it probably won't be that interesting to listen to or watch.

Speaker 1:          00:27:03       We'll have it just like as like a supplemental thing or we'll do it on twitch. Twitch is this thing that uh, these young kids are doing these days. Twitches this. Um, and I'm sorry if this is popping, I might be too close to this if I'm popping my peas twitches. His thing that um, young kids are doing words. You're watching video games being played by other people and it's really popular. Hugely popular. In fact, they make money from it. They, they play video games and they make money playing video games. Like who saw that coming? Nobody. Right. Nobody ever thought that it would be interesting to watch people play video games, but when I used to play quake, people used to get into these things called demos. Like you would watch guys like there's this, this kid named thresh. He was like the big game or back in the day, um, the big quake players like one of the best in the world if not the best.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       And uh, I would watch his demos just cause he could fuck black guys up playing that game in a way that I could never do. And I think if you can watch someone do something, like what I was competing in taekwondo tournament's one of the things that really helped me a lot was I would go, like when I was coming up, I would go and watch like big time tournaments. Like I went to Colorado Springs to watch the World Cup and this was in like, I would say like 1986 I think it was. And I went to Colorado Springs to wash the World Cup because I knew that the best fighters in the world, we're going to be there. The best taekwondo guys, guys like herb Perez and um, God, I'm trying to remember some of these names. Um, there was this guy, not seem, no, I don't remember his last name, but he was this bad motherfucker from the Ivory Coast.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       Boy, I'll remember it as soon as this podcast is over, I'll remember his name. It's driving me crazy. Um, Patrice, patrice remark, that's his name. Patrice remark was his name, was not, not seeing, not seen was another guy who is also a bad motherfucker. There was a bunch of them. But anyway, these guys were like at a very high level, um, much, much better than me. And I remember going and watching them compete made me better. I remember seeing that level of competition and then all of a sudden in my mind, uh, I had higher expectations of myself and a higher, um, higher, higher ceiling I guess of potential. Like I looked at all these guys and how good they were and I realized what was possible. So it, it sort of ramped up in my mind what I needed to do to be at my best.

Speaker 1:          00:29:47       And immediately afterwards I went on to win one of the biggest tournaments over one, which was um, well one of the biggest in Massachusetts, the bay state games, which was right after I got back it just from watching, I got better. Guaranteed point is we would watch these things, um, these uh, demos in quake. So what you could do is there was a, you had hit the till Dickey until the key is that key that's right below the escape button on your laptop or your uh, your keyboard rather. And it would pull this dropdown menu like a, like a control panel, not even a dropdown menu. It was just like, it was like code, like dos and you'd have to type in certain things. I forget what the, how you would do it, but you had to learn like what little symbols to use and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       Like it was almost like kind of coding, but you could, you could type in demo and you could run a demo and then later on, I think they put it in the menu, the actual menu of the game. But in the old days, like especially the quake one days used to have to uh, used to have to know what to write in the code and then you can record demo and he would record a demo. And this way you'd be watching the game play out from the person's eyes. Like you would watch their screen, like what they're seeing when they're playing the game and it made you better. It definitely did. And I think it's exciting to watch too. It's exciting to see if someone could pull something off. Like I'd watch this a thresh guy or um, there was another guy named a mortal, he was a bad motherfucker and uh, he was uh, another guy who was like one of the best in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       You'd watch him play and you just go cheese us. Cause he would, he would hit guys like there'd be an in mid air, like jumping and he would shoot them in the face of the rocket. Just he was so good. He would rail guys, they had a rail gun. Is this this a super high powered thing that shoots this? I guess like, I don't know what a rail is, a ball or something like that, but it has this cool like tracer behind it, like this laser tracer like show and it's almost like instantaneous. Um, the, the speed in it, it's faster than a rocket and you'd be able to, you'd have to time it just absolutely perfectly. And these guys would be able to do things with those rail guns that were just so impressive to someone who's suck like me. You did watch it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       You watch it through their eyes and like fuck. And it just made you realize how bad you socked and how good they are and how much you had to, how much more you had to work at it. It was like, one of the weird things about those games is, um, how deep the rabbit hole goes. Like the guys who are like really good, they were so much better than, than someone like me who was kind okay. Like I was okay as long as I was playing somebody who sucked or somebody who was like, at my level, we just really didn't know what they're doing. And I was fucking playing a lot. I was playing like eight hours a day at one point in time, sometimes even more completely obsessed. I would, it would, it would fuck up all sorts of aspects of my life. I wouldn't get anything done that would be constantly like just engrossed in improving my performance in this fucking crazy game.

Speaker 1:          00:33:06       And playing it online too was so exciting because you'd be playing against a bunch of people and these people would be, you know, in real time essentially. There was a little bit of lag in between when you would shoot and when it would show up on the screen, dependent upon how fast your connection was. But if you had a pretty decent connection, like cable modem or something like that and you know, the person was near you, like fairly close in the same city or something like that, or at least in the same state, you'd get like really commensurate pings and you'd have these awesome matches where you'd be basically playing in real time against each other. It's just so exciting. And these levels that you would play on if you've never played it. 3D shooter like unreal or quake or doom or um, there's, there's, you know, there's a bunch of them now, but these games that you would play, the graphics would be so intense, there'd be all these wild maps that you would play on.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       It was just really exciting and so much more exciting than any other game or any other thing that I've ever done before. Um, you know, outside of fighting, uh, in a competitive way, which just completely engrossing. Uh, so I, I really had a problem with it for a long time. If you listen to this podcast for any length of episodes, I'm sure it's come up more than once. I know I talk about the same things over and over again sometimes. And that's unfortunate, but I always feel like somebody's, somebody's listening doesn't know that story. And if I don't tell that story, it's not going to make sense. The people that are the hardcore people that have heard this podcast, you know, listen to a hundred plus episodes. You probably have heard that story, but you know, the, the real issue is how many people that are new that are tuning in for the first time haven't, I don't want to leave it out just because I'm worried that someone's already heard it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:56       So I always try to put that caveat in it. For those of you who have heard this before, I'm sorry. So my, um, my video game career as far as a, I wouldn't call it a career obsession. My, my period of obsession lasted a few years and I eventually had to quit cold Turkey. I had to walk away cause it was just really interfering with my life. And, uh, here's another story that I've told before, but I'll tell it again just because people haven't heard it. There was a guy who was a manager of the comedy store. It was a really nice guy. His name was rob and rob was a in the back of the comedy store once and he said he was addicted to everquest

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       and everquest was, uh, like world of warcraft was one of the first, one of those, um, role playing games. Those multiperson weird world games where you, you know, I'm a sorcerer and you have either cloak and go get a bag of gold and was wacky fucking games. But he was super addicted to it. And one of the things that he said was, he said, I'm so good at making money in the game world, but so bad at making money in the real world. And the way he said it was like this revelation, like what the fuck is wrong with me? He was really devastated and he was sitting there, he's Pale, looked like he hadn't seen his son and weeks he looked like he hadn't sleeping right. His eyes were all fucked up from staring at a computer screen every day. And that was the moment I think where I realize like, oh yeah, like these fucking things will sap you have your life.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       Like it might be fun while it's happening, but it's, when it's over, it's not fun. Like the memories, they're, they're weird memories. Like, if you play a game, like say if you, uh, play a baseball game and you knock a home run out of the park and everybody cheers and he run the bases and you high five your teammates, you have a good time. That's a real memory. But if you play a guy in a video game and you play for eight hours and you beat him in some, some crazy match when it's over, he don't feel like anything really happened.

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       I wonder if that's the case. If someone's playing in a major tournament, maybe it was just me because I have the, uh, I had the, the thought in my head that I was wasting my time like that, um, I should be doing other things. I have things that I need to be doing and I'm fucking off and playing this video game. And so I had like a negative attachment to the idea of playing a game. And maybe if I was like one of those dudes are like one of those starcraft games. I don't know if you're familiar at all with video games, but if you, uh, if you are familiar, you know that they have these crazy star craft tournament's in Korea and um, I guess they have been America too and that they, maybe Europe as well. Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass, but in Korea I know they're huge and they fill up arenas. I'm talking like, like a fucking Coliseum, like 25,000 people and they have these giant screens and people watch these guys play video games in real time and they cheer and they know like the moves. So when someone's doing something good, they get crazy. And when someone's making a mistake they're like, oh no, it's weird. It's weird to watch. And I believe there's real money in it. Like I know there's, um, guys that do play in video games and tournaments and then professional

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       video game leagues that can actually make real money. And then they make that money on that twitch thing as well. Twitch, uh, I don't know. It's twitch.com I guess they somehow or another, I don't, it's been explained to me, but I forgot. There's, um, I guess people, I don't know if you get paid per how many people are watching you or people donate or, I dunno, they make money. They make money off of twitch. So there's that. So maybe those people that are playing these, these big time, starcraft tournament's maybe to them it feels the same way as it would feel if you were a major league chess player and you won a tournament. I swear. Because some games are highly respected and some games nobody gives a fuck about like games. They carry their own sort of, I dunno, not really prejudice, but games have their own little thing that they're attached to them, right? Like chess. Chess is a thinking person's game. And if you tell someone you played chess, they're like, Ooh, you must be smart. Right? It tells me to play poker. They go, oh, you degenerate gambler. Fuck. Like there's, there's games that people don't appreciate. Like you tell someone, yeah, I'm uh, I played for professional pool. They go, oh, that's a thing. You know, it's not like something like someone saying they're a professional chess master. I mean a grandmaster of chess.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       It becomes, um, that, that's like very respectable. Grand Masters. Very close to grand wizard though. That's one of the hilarious things about the KKK. They've wizards, the grand wizard. Like what? He's a grand wizard of the KKK. He's a, he's a wizard. You fucking child. You're a wizard. Uh, have a fuck that I get. Their point is there's no point. I have no point. Point is, um, video games. Uh, they scared the shit out of me because they'd cost me a few years of my life. Not really. I mean, I had a good time. I had fun, learned, learned that I have a problem with games along the way, but I already knew that because of pool. And a, I knew that because of martial arts too, because martial arts, it's very similar in a lot of ways to games. Most recent podcast, Brian Callan, we, uh, we talked about that with, um, we're talking about Josh Waitzkin who is a famous chess prodigy who, uh, I feel like he was the inspiration behind the movie, searching for Bobby Fischer, looking for Bobby Fischer or searching for Bobby Fischer, the movie with the Little Kid who was a chess master.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       I'm pretty sure Josh waitzkin was a, um, a big part of the motivation or the inspiration for that movie. And he went on to become a really fascinated by Jujitsu, was a student of Marcello Garcia. I'm pretty sure he's a black belt now. He's a brown belt back when I was communicating with them on online, were sending emails back and forth because my friend Nathan was training with him and, uh, he connected the two of us together. And you know, Josh is a fascinating guy and he was also responsible for Marcello Garcia putting a lot of content online, I believe, I hope I'm not wrong about this, but Marcello Mig and action was a really interesting website where Marcello was constantly rolling with people rolling with new people in a school. And he was, uh, you know, like people would come in and train with them. Like Eddie went down, Eddie Bravo went down there and he trained with them and they film it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       They put the role, the sparring session online. But they're all very friendly sparring sessions, but, you know, competitive. And if you don't know, Marcello Garcia, he is a fascinating character himself. He's a brilliant, brilliant Jujitsu player who's a really nice guy. And you look at him and he's like kind of baby faced and smiley, but he's just one of the best in the world. And, um, he doesn't compete anymore. He's getting older and you know, he stepped down. But I, I had, uh, the opportunity to watch him compete in 2003 and Brazil in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Um, that was back when, uh, Eddie Bravo, uh, choked out. Hoya gracie are tapped out horribly. Gracie with a triangle choke. He was the first American never top of Gracie. And in that main, uh, tournament, that's this huge Abu Dhabi submission tournament. The star of the show was Marcella Garcia. He was without a doubt the star of the show.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       He, uh, fought this guy, he had a match with the Sky Victor Shaolin who barrow, who was a very respected Jujitsu guy and he choked him unconscious and it was just a wild scramble. He caught his back and Shaolin tried to roll out of it and marcel just sunk it in deeper and deeper. And before Shalon could even tap, he was out cold and, uh, Marcella was just running through the competition. I remember we were all watching him going, Holy Shit. Who is this guy just came out of nowhere and was just so dominant and so dynamic. And he had some really specific moves that he liked to hit. Um, and particularly the way he would take people's backs. He was so good at chokes and he also had a really scientific approach, um, where he wouldn't want, if you guys can hear that the fan just kicked off, do you care?

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       No one cares, right? Bitch off. Off. Yeah. It goes. Um, but he, he had, uh, an interesting approach where he had a few techniques that he would do, but he would do them extremely well. Like he didn't have this gigantic arsenal that he would attack with. He would attack with gay teens and you attack with rear naked chokes. And there was a lot of things that he wouldn't do. He wasn't a big guy. It wasn't like a big muscular guy, which is one of the more interesting things about him when you look at him. It wasn't a scary guy. He wasn't like, there's certain Jujitsu guys, you look at them and you go Jesus, like who some are Pahar s is one of the best examples of that cause he's just built like a freak. Like he's built like the comic book version of Wolverine.

Speaker 1:          00:44:49       He's a short guy with giant muscles, just thick fucking neck, just terrifying guy rips people's legs apart too and doesn't necessarily let go when they tap. He's kind of known for that, which makes them even scarier. He's injured a lot of guys, but he looks like a scary guy. When you look at Marcello Garcia, he's like a really smiley guy. And, um, because of the fact that it wasn't a very physically nothing, he wasn't physically strong, but it wasn't a freak athlete. It wasn't just explosive, dominant, just really muscular guy. He developed just razor sharp technique and leverage and that's how he won his matches with, that's how I ones matches, which made it even more impressive really. And his, his main techniques were chokes. So most of the time it's putting guys to sleep or, or forcing them to tap. But there was a lot of techniques that were really common well-respected techniques that he just never used.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       And he would openly talk about them. Like the Camorra, uh, which is a famous technique is actually called the double wrist lock in catch wrestling, catch wrestling. When people think about pro wrestling, we think about pro wrestling. You think about like Hulk Hogan and the Rock and the Seattle tricks and these pre scripted events. But wrestling used to be at one point in time, it used to be an actual match. Like there was actual professional wrestling and there was a, uh, a style of wrestling called catch or catch as catch can think. That's how they would say and catch wrestling. There's like these guys like Karl gotch and farmer Burns and a lot of guys who wound up teaching, uh, some modern day MMA fighters and grappling competitors like Josh Barnett. Josh Barnett is probably the most famous and the most successful catch wrestling enthusiast and practitioner like Josh Barnett is tapped out some really famous Brazilian Jujitsu competitors like, uh, here on Gracie or a dean lister. Dean lister being an incredibly impressive, because Dean hadn't tapped to anybody and I've got, I want to say at least 10 years when Josh finished him in, uh, this competition called metamorris. But, um, that's what wrestling used to be. And they had a bunch of submissions. Like a lot of the submissions that we think of as Jujitsu submissions also existed in catch wrestling. And I guess when people are, you know, grappling,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       I mean, the people been grappling through at the beginning of time. I mean, when people first started fighting, that's probably how they fought each other. They probably grabbed each other and got close enough to bite or hang onto each other. And then slowly people started realizing, hey, you know, when I do this, it seems to keep the guy away from me. Or when I do this I can hold onto them. Or I used to hold them like this, but now I realize when I hold him like this, it works even better. And, uh, when I do this, it really hurts. And when I do this, it doesn't hurt. And so they, you know, I mean, back in the days of the spartans and the Romans, if you look at some of the statues, like I was in Italy recently and we were, we went to Rome and we, uh, looked at some of the, the artwork of the Vatican in particular.

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       There's just a lot of statues of guys wrestling, a lot of, lot of looks like, like grappling holds and grappling position. So it's been around forever. But what Brazilian Jujitsu really was, is these guys who are not very big, Elio and Carlos Gracie of there, they weren't the biggest guys in the world. There were small and they weren't physically strong and they figured out how to use technique and leverage to overcome physical strength. And one of the matches that Eylea got in early in his career, he would have these crazy matches with people. He had a match with this guy named Kimora and Kamora caught him in, um, what catch wrestling would call a double wrist lock where you clamp down one hand on the wrist and then you throw an over hook around the arm and clamp your other hand down on your wrist. So you have one hand on his wrist, one hand on your wrist and it creates this awesome fulcrum point and you can manipulate someone's arm.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       But Marcello Garcia always felt like that position required a lot of physical strength and he wasn't a very strong guy, so he just abandoned that. He just decided it wasn't an option and it was just going to concentrate primarily on things that were sort of just had ultimate technique to them. And chokes pretty much have ultimate technique. And one of the reasons why I chose an ultimate technique is if someone lands it perfectly, they you go unconscious. Whereas an Armbar like guys have gotten their arm broken before and come back and fought and won and had their heart are awfully hyperextended and come back and won. Like a perfect example in Jujitsu is Hodrick gracie versus joc arrays is a very famous match between two guys that are competing in mma now. But back when they were fighting and Jujitsu, they were amongst the best in the world. And Hydro Gracie caught jock Ra in an arm bar and snapped his arm and jockey would not tap, he would not tap. And he fought out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       And eventually, um, he was ahead on points when he got up, uh, when he got out of the arm bar, but his arm was just destroyed. So if I remember correctly, I think he might've even tucked his arm inside his belt and just kept going until the time limit ran out. And then a raised his one good arm and got all excited and you know, had one because he gutted it out and would not tap when this guy snapped his fucking arm. And this is by the way, professional Jujitsu. This isn't even mma. This is not like a, you know, a Rhonda Rousey match or a conor mcgregor fight where they're making millions and millions of dollars. I don't know how much money this guy was getting paid for for this Jujitsu match in his sponsors and how much it was actually worth to him. But as far as his pride, it was worth it to him to actually get his arm broken instead of tapping, which is fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Uh, so boy, that's a long and circuitous. I've lost my own train of thought. My train of thought was that there's certain techniques that you could really hurt a guy, but they don't have to quit. And Hydro Gracie landed the perfect arm bar on Joc array, broke his arm and jock rates still won the fight on points at least. I mean, if they had been fighting old school gracie way, your probably would have eventually got him because Jacari really couldn't defend himself correctly anymore. And he would, he would eventually, since he's only got one arm to defend himself, heidrick probably would have wound up choking them or catching him in something else. Uh, but you know, it's entirely possible he wouldn't, and it's totally possible that Shakuri even with a broken arm could have gotten him. But the point being when you choke someone to sleep instead of break their arm, they can't do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:52:16       They're done. You, you put them to sleep. And that was Marcello Garcia, his philosophy. He realized that he could just put someone to sleep and then they could be no debate as to whether or not he was going to win and no debate as to whether or not the, the move was actually efficient or effective. It was obviously affected. The guy was asleep. And, uh, that's what we saw in Brazil when he fought a Shaolin and just put him to sleep. I mean, seconds too. It's a crazy, crazy video that you could watch on youtube. Um, so Josh Waitzkin, who was a, um, a student of Marcello's put all of 'em Marcello's moves and sort of just sort of like a, as something that people can learn from and grow from and put it all online. So Games doing podcast. So Josh who is a, obviously because of he's a chess prodigy, is fascinated by games and chess being one of the most intellectually inspiring games got really into Jujitsu as well.

Speaker 1:          00:53:22       So I just know because of the way I got into martial arts and the way I got into video games and pool, it's just, there's something about those weird challenges that can really, they can, uh, really excite the mind. The only problem is I don't necessarily know if they have the same kind of real world benefits as getting really good at a sport or getting really good at an actual physical activity where you move around and do things. So I dunno. Uh, but we will eventually do a doom podcast and I will, uh, I will prepare myself where I make sure that there's no fucking way I get completely and totally addicted anymore. Cause I've been there, I've been there. It's not the move. I can't, I don't have time for that anymore. Uh, other questions here who will do international paper view instead of you?

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Uh, if you don't know what that question is about. I uh, decided recently I was getting, at one point in time it was going to not work for the UFC anymore. I was going to just do these fight companion podcasts that I do with Eddie Bravo and Brendan Schaub and Brian counts sometimes and, and other people sometimes too, when those guys were out of town. I did one recently with Joey Diaz was one of the best ones ever. But what did it, what the fight companions are as we just sit around and we'd watch the fights and we talk some shit and I don't, I'm not working that way. Um, I just work a little bit too much, um, between standup comedy, writing, standup comedy, doing podcasts, researching the guests, researching subjects. I'm researching potential guests. Uh, and then life, you know, all the other things that I have to do was exercise, Yoga, forget about family time, all that other stuff is, you know, that also there's a lot of time that is already accounted for.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       And then there was a ufc and I had to figure out what things I wasn't, what, what things I could cut back on. I wasn't going to cut back on family life. Um, I wasn't going to, I don't, I don't want to cut back on my recreational activities because they keep me sane for, for, for me. I need a bunch of stuff that I'm interested in. I can't just work. Uh, even though work is awesome, I love doing stand up, uh, love. I even love doing the UFC. I love it. I love it. I mean it's, it's a very exciting job and it's an honor to be able to do, but, but it's, it's work and it requires energy and it requires focus. And I feel like at the end of the day, you only have so much energy and so much focus and you could be in a situation where you almost are two fortunate and you have, you have too many things that you enjoy. And that's where I kind of found myself. So, um, so that's

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       what I decided. I sided decided what I'm going to do is I am going to only do North American paper view. That's it. No more fox shows, no more long international flights because first of all, those things fucking wreck your body. They're wreck me. I would do them. And then for days like I just got back from Italy. It took me like a week, like at least four or five days before I felt it felt normal again. It just, your buys all fucked up, you're jet lagged, you're confused, you're exhausted. You just feel, you feel like you're at 60% all the time. You're always trying to push through. And uh, it's a drag enthusiasm and having a vitality like physical vitality and feeling good and feeling healthy is a big factor in life for me. Um, that's, that's a huge thing. I like feeling good. I like being healthy when I know something is going to make me feel physically bad and make me feel unhealthy.

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       I try to avoid as much as possible. Uh, you know, there's sometimes I give in like, uh, maybe I'll have a couple of drinks with some friends and we get a little crazy and the next day I'm like, Oh, you dummy. I've done that before obviously. But even the, like a hangover, I feel better in a day. Those fucking jet lags like, uh, a flight from, oops, a flight from Sydney just knocked over the phone, a flight from Sydney, Australia. That shit takes me a long time to get better from a, I don't want to become complaining here. My point being, I try to avoid things that make me feel shitty physically. And unfortunately a lot of flying makes you feel shitty and especially flying along hours. So who's going to do the international paper views? I think with the way they're doing it now is Dan Hardee was a former fighter and, uh, he's been a guest on his podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       He's a fucking awesome guy. Super Smart Dude. Super tuned in, really interesting and intelligent guy. And um, Dan actually trained with Dan for years. Back in the day when Dan used to train at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu, whenever he was in town, he was getting ready for a fight. He would come to a Eddie bravos gym and train. I trained with them multiple times. Super Nice Guy. So Dan Hardee, we'll probably do a lot of them. And then of course, Brian Stann who is fantastic, who was also been on his podcast, he'll do a lot of them. Um, and then there's also, Kenny Florian is also great. He'll do, I don't, I don't know how they worked that out. Like who does what, but those are the ones that we're going to do it. So, uh, that would be the answer to that. You fucks. I don't know. I mean, I really don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:59:16       Um, I dunno what's gonna happen with this new ownership thing? Either there's a bunch of new people that uh, took over the UFC now that u of c is still going to be run by Dana White, which is one of the reasons why I decided to stay because a, you know, Dana and I are or close, we've been good friends for a long time and I, one of the things that I was really nervous about was the idea that Dana was going to leave and some suits are going to take over and then I was going to have to have meetings with people. They're going to tell me what I could or couldn't say or give me advice on how to do it or any of that stupid shit. I was like, fuck this. That was like, it was answering the question for me, like what am I going to cut back in my life?

Speaker 2:          01:00:01       As soon as I heard that they were thinking about selling, I was like, well they're, that answered it for me. But as time went on and I really thought more and more about it, I, I really thought that I would miss it and I don't want to. And also, um, I mean, I don't mean to sound Corny, but all the love that I got from people online, it influenced my be my, my thinking too made me think that I probably should think about sticking it out. So, uh, that's the answer to that. What do I think about the Fermi paradox? That's an interesting question. If you don't know what the Fermi paradox is, the actual definition is you to here, the actual definition is a, it's about aliens. The question is where are okay, here it is. Where is everybody? The idea is if there is an is named after, I'll go to the wikipedia. The fermi paradox is named after Enrico Fermi, uh, as the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence and the high probability estimates, those given by the drake equation for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations. And the drake equation is it's, uh, an equation that's here. I'll go to the wikipedia that it, it's used to arrive at an estimate of the number of active communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy.

Speaker 2:          01:01:28       And the Fermi paradox is if you look at all of the stars in our galaxy alone, billions of stars and billions of galaxies, hundreds of billions of stars, hundreds of billions of galaxies, many of them which are many, many, many years older than our galaxy, many years older than our planet. The question is why haven't these aliens contacted us? Where is everybody? So that's the question. The fermi paradox. I've thought about this a lot, so I'm actually happy about this question. I have a feeling that our ideas about what a society or what civilization does as it advances are based entirely on our idea that we are dependent upon the monkey body that were dependent upon the physical flesh and the idea of being somewhere in a measurable way that that's the only way you can experience something. Um, I think that that, I think that's, that's an error on our part.

Speaker 2:          01:02:43       I don't think that we are going to be attached to the physical body forever. Does it sounds like hippie nonsense, silly woo bullshit. But this is my thought behind it. I think that first of all we are moving closer and closer every day to being integrated with technology and by integrated with technology. I think initially it's going to happen where there's going to be some sort of a chip that we have in our body, whether it's uh, something that we use that it helps us, enhances our vision or enhances our mental function or our ability to communicate with each other or our ability to access information. It's entirely possible that it might start out as some sort of a helmet that we put on that lets us, you know, like maybe like a ball cap with electrodes on it and you put this thing on and it stimulates areas of your brain that allow you to see these images.

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       And maybe perhaps like some sort of a screen like minority report, like it'll be in front of you. Will, you'll be able to access data, will, you'll be able to ask it questions. I mean I have is hey siri function. We have this, Hey Siri, function on our, um, our phones that people get pissed off when I say it. When I say those words on the podcast, because if you have an android phone, you don't know this, but if you have an iphone, you have that option on. If someone says those words, Hey Siri, your phone goes buddy. Like you're asking it a question. So you say, Hey Siri, where's the fellow? Get a blow job around here, or whatever. Ask it some questions and it'll actually answer you. You, you could say, hey, Siri called Dunkin. It'll call Dunkin. Uh, Hey Siri, navigate to the Hollywood bowl. It'll give you the directions to get to the Hollywood bowl in real time.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       It's amazing. And it's science fiction. It's something that just a few years ago was completely outside of our imagination. We really didn't think that they were going to have something that sat on the table next to you. Some small little sliver of glass and metal and whatever the fuck it's made of electrodes. No, it's in their silicone. That you could talk to that thing and say, Hey Siri. And it would, uh, you, you could say, Hey Siri, what is the Fermi paradox? And it would google it for you. This is all something that's going on right now and this is just one step. It's one step in what is really as long as human being stay alive as long we don't get nuked as long as we don't murk ourselves, as long as we don't get fucked up by a super volcano or an asteroid or some polar shift or some natural disaster.

Speaker 2:          01:05:30       As long as that doesn't happen and we just not, we not obviously not me, but people smarter than me who do this kind of shit, they're going to continue to innovate and as they continue to innovate, we're going to get technology that is more and more powerful and I think more and more integrated in our, in our our lives and in our physical bodies. I think it's going to reach, there's going to be a bottleneck where holding a device in your hand, it just doesn't have the same effect or do the same amount of things as they could do if they actually put it in your head and I think people are going to fucking volunteer for it. I think they're going to volunteer for it. Like they volunteer for braces, like they get eyeglasses at the optometrist, like they get fake tits people got, they're going to get these things put in their bodies and it's going to be really common and maybe won't even have to be in your brain.

Speaker 2:          01:06:26       Maybe that'll be the the hold back people like I don't want to my brain, and they'll go, well, we don't have to do that. We put on your wrist. It'll communicate with your brain through the nervous system or through electrical impulses through your tissue itself. And maybe that along with some sort of a hat that you put on that allows you to interface with the Internet. That's going to be us step. But somewhere along the line, if you listen to guys like Ray Kurzweil who believe ray believes that you're going to eventually be able to download your consciousness into a computer, which of course gets really fucking weird because what are you then? Are you still there? Here's the question. If you download your consciousness into a computer, are you still existing in the physical sense? So if you exist in the physical sense and your consciousness is downloaded into a computer to do the, to get to talk to each other, or are you like, do you end your life in the physical sense and then begin one in a digital sense and as it even a life.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       But if it exists and some sort of a matrix like state, if they could figure out a way, you know, there's a lot of people today that just, they just, they're not happy with the life that they've been handed with the, the, the roll of the dice. Maybe they have physical deformities, maybe they have poor health. There's a lot of, uh, people that just got a shitty hand when it comes to life. Like a life is not even in the cards of the deals. I don't have to tell you this, you all know this, right? And if someone came along like a, what was that guy's name and the Matrix, the guy who a wound up selling, everybody who just said he wanted it to be famous or rich or something like that. He's eating a steak in the Matrix and decides to give in that that kind of existence.

Speaker 2:          01:08:25       If someone comes along and says, look, you don't have to live this life in the physical sense anymore, instead of being dependent upon this monkey body and the tooth Fang and claw of natural selection and evolution and this just the struggle, the struggle of being a fucking human being. Instead of that you can exist in this perfect state where you are constantly in love and just filled with joy and having a wonderful life filled with only positive experiences. And you can enjoy this with, with no negative repercussions. You could just, you, you can become a part of the matrix, a part of the thing, whatever they're going to call it. And from there you will be the architect of your existence. You will be able to decide this idea, that law. Well, the bad days, they make you feel good about the good days, you know, there's no sunshine without rain.

Speaker 2:          01:09:31       You know, you got to have good and evil. Well that's, that's here, that's in this state, in this physical state. Yeah. You have to have good and you have to have eagle as we know it right now in this life. We do appreciate our loved ones. When something terrible happens, when there's a tragedy happens. Um, we, we do, uh, appreciate the people that are alive. When someone we care about dies. Those are all, those are all true. But is that the only way that we can appreciate each other? Is that the only way we can enjoy life? Some people would say yes, but I don't think they'd really know. I think that's just, we're basing that on what we have experienced and what we would currently, the data we're pulling from being a human being, living on earth. If someone can engineer, and this is not something that might happen in a year or in a hundred years, but we're, we might be talking about something that happens at a thousand years or 2000 years, who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:10:26       But around the same time where we think that, uh, technologically based civilization would develop the capability of star travel, of being able to travel not just into, uh, another solar system, but perhaps he'd do another galaxy. But maybe hundreds of galaxies away, who knows? But that kind of incredible ability to control your environment. We might not ever get there and we might not ever get there because we realize that being there physically is not nearly as important as the experience. Like um, you know I've often said this about psychedelics that people say, Oh, you know, you have a psychedelic drug experience. Yeah. You, Oh, you're imagining things are happening, you're hallucinating. Well, sort of, yes, but no. Like it might not actually be happening. Like if you have this experience, we take a psychedelic drug and you are transported to the center of the universe and you are communicating with love, with love in the form of beautifully lit neon geometric patterns that are constantly changing and morphing and they're filling you up with a wisdom and, and joy and appreciation.

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       When people say, well, that's a hallucination. You're taking a drug and you're having a hallucination maybe. But either way the experience is still the same. Like the experience of meeting God because you took mushrooms and and having this incredible meeting with the, the divine force of the universe. If, if that happens in real life or if that happens in a psychedelic drug trip, the feeling and the experience are still the same. It might not be a real physical thing and the sense of you might not be able to take it and put it in a pillowcase and throw it on a scale and weigh it, but you can't. Who's to say you could ever do that anyway, like it's the exact same experience of meeting God. It might be just as good as my point. So this idea that, well I don't want to live in the matrix, man.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       I want to live in the real world. Are you sure? What's the benefit of the real world? I mean it's the only reason why we think that the real world contains some sort of benefit for us is because that's the only model that we have to go on that this is the pattern that we've been following our whole lives. That this idea that you know you live and then you die and then you do your best along the way. Sometimes you got to push through the pain and sometimes you got to fucking get up in the morning where you don't want to get up and you gotta. You gotta work hard and when you work hard it pays off and you get a good life and you know your, your discipline equals your freedom and ugh. There's a lot of thoughts that we have about living life that are applicable to this physical knock on wood life.

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       It's real life that you and I are experiencing right now. Everybody listening to this podcast, he had a pug your phone and you had to listen to it on a computer. You got to touch some things and something had to happen for you to free to experience something in a, in a, in a real sense. But that's just because this is what we're used to. We're, we're, we're definitely not used to. And if she would talk about human beings, if you went back 200 years ago or definitely not used to the Internet, we're definitely not used to movies. 200 years ago we didn't even have fucking cars. If you wanted a picture of something, you had to draw it. We're used to all these things now we're used to photograph. The idea of not being able to take photos on vacation is alien. The idea of having to get in a boat and travel across the country.

Speaker 2:          01:14:22       Like I was talking about how I just got back from Italy, if I lived in the 18 hundreds I would have had to been on a boat for months. I would have had to made it from California all the way to New York and then I had, would have had to been in a fucking boat and gone across the ocean the same way my grandparents did when they were little kids. My grandparents came over here from Italy when they were like, um, I think my grandfather was like seven years old. I think he said I would've had to have done all that stuff. It's not going to happen. Right. So the idea of no photos is alien. The idea of no movies, no, no, no, no cameras, no TV shows, no radio. There's no radio back then. What the fuck? You couldn't tune into a radio show in 1800 it didn't have them.

Speaker 2:          01:15:16       They didn't exist. All these things that are now a normal everyday part of our lives. We're alien just a few hundred years ago, which in terms of human civilization and certainly in terms of the life of human beings, the existence of human beings, it's not even a blink of an eye. This is all new and we couldn't imagine life without it. I think if time keeps going or if rather a civilization keeps going over time, if we don't do something incredibly stupid or get fucked up in some sort of a natural catastrophe, we're going to come up with an ability to manipulate our environment, our world, our perceptions, our mind to create an artificial world and artificial universe. That's impossible for our little fucking chimpanzee brains to, to imagine. I don't think we have the capacity to do, to, to connect all the dots. I think with each new invention it opens up a new complete realm of possibility.

Speaker 2:          01:16:23       Like you couldn't say to someone in 1,801 day you're going to have google. Cause they'd be like, what the fuck are you talking about? Well one day you're gonna be able to talk to your phone. What the fuck is a phone? But one day you're going to be able to talk to your electronic device. What's electronics? What do you, what does the fuck are you saying? What are you a wizard that you would be saying something to them that didn't make any sense at all. And that I think is how we have to look at the possibility for two or 300 years from now. There's going to be new things that get invented along the way. And you know, in the old West who's electricity that metals, new ways of connecting things and then teletype and Morse code and all these different things got invented before they invented computers.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       The Internet, the world where we're dealing with right now, when, when you look at two, 300 years from now, I think it's entirely possible that these ideas that we have about what the future is going to be like. There was, there's big chunks missing. There's chunks missing from a thought process and it's because these paradigm shifting revelations, inventions and innovations, they haven't occurred yet. And when those things do occur, I think it's going to forever change what the future will be. And as these things occur, whether it's the ability to download consciousness or whether it's the ability to record thoughts in, in your own mind, record memories, dreams, that's a real possibility. What their thinking is. There's going to be a time where you were going to have a hard drive, like a virtual hard drive or a physical hard drive, rather like someone's going to put an SD card slot in your head, not an SD card slot, something probably much smaller.

Speaker 2:          01:18:20       It might even be as small as like Ray Kurzweil has said as a cell, like a blood cell, like one red blood cell in your body that's a machine or a computer or a camera or some sort of recording device. This thing may be able to record your thoughts, record how it feels to be you. Like say if you, uh, you know, fill in the blank. If you're A, I dunno who Ashton Kutcher, let's pretend you're asked in coacher. If Ashton Kutcher decides to record his thoughts and his life and his day and to take it and uploaded to the web and you could feel what it feels like to be him, you know, or maybe someone who you would always love to find out how they think, you know, like maybe Chris Rock, like a great comedian. Like how does Chris Rock look at the world? Where's he coming up with material?

Speaker 2:          01:19:16       Has This guy think? How, what, how does he feel about himself? You know, like a, a guy like Louis C K who say I'm very self deprecating guy. How's he feel about himself? You know, maybe guy like Jon Jones, so great fighter or Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson. How does he feel about himself? How does he think, what does, what does it feel like to be him? What does it feel like to be mighty mouse for a day? What does it feel like to go through a workout? You could actually feel it. You get experience it. You could beat him for a short period of time. I think that is inevitable. I really do. I think that has as inevitable as recording, uh, a picture of your kid blowing out their birthday cake and you watching a video on your iphone when you're doing that, when you're videotaping someone's wedding, when you're videotaping a sporting event, when you're holding your camera up at the UFC and you're watching the fights, you're capturing time.

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       You, you will, you are capturing an image of something. We're so used to it. We don't, we don't even understand how fucking insane it is. It is so insane that you could take something that's so small. It's not even as thick as a deck of cards. You take it out of your pocket and it could film hours of shit hours. You can capture hours of images and then you show it to me and you could have been on the other side of the world. You could be in New Zealand and you could be filming some insane mountain view that was in the movie, the Hobbit, and it could be you and your friends and your backpack in there and you're laughing and joking and you make a video and then you can send it to me through the fucking air and it could reach my phone on the other side of the planet in seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:21:07       This is nuts. It's nuts. It is completely fucking bananas, but we're really used to it and it stands to reason to me that this ability is only going to accelerate. Their only going to get better. It's only going to get more, more in depth. It's only going to get, the experience is not just going to be visual right now it's visual and it's two dimensional is going to be virtual. It's going to turn into a virtual experience. Then it's going to be something that involves much more than just the simple senses of sound and sight. You're going to have, it's going to, there's going to be feeling, there's going to be neurological responses. There's going to be memory, there's going to be, then it's going to be emotional. You're gonna be able to feel emotions. I think we're going to be able to record thoughts and ideas.

Speaker 2:          01:22:00       And the same way we're able to encode and record visual images like photographs or, or audio like this podcast. Like, you know, I'm sitting here right now. What time is it? Six 30 for Friday, July 29th in Atlanta. I'm recording this. You might be listening to this a hundred years from now in the future. And you might be saying, whoa. Like I was listening to this Alan Watts, uh, recording the other day that was on universal basic income, which is a, a constant, uh, subject right now. It's been going on around the idea of a is you actually just gave people money so that they could live. So I didn't have to worry about making a living. It would open them up to a lot of other possibilities and at this idea that putting people on welfare or the Dole, it just makes them lazy, might not necessarily be true.

Speaker 2:          01:22:51       And that it actually might be better if we didn't look at it that way. If we just looked at it the way of you, once your basic needs are covered, then you're free to express yourself in a much more natural way without desperation. And that desperation doesn't always mean you're going to make the best decisions. And it really would cost us less if we gave people money. Okay. Anyway, point being this is an Alan Watts, a discussion where Alan Watts was making this speech about this from the 1960s so it was more than 50 years old. Um, I think somewhere around 50 point being, it's, it's entirely possible that this recording that I'm making right now, someday somebody might listen to 50 years from now, a hundred years from now, 200 years from now, and they'll laugh the laugh at how wrong I got it. Or maybe they'll laugh at how I called it and we will be living in some sort of a strange world where reality is not something that you measure.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       You can't like take a ruler to it or you know, and measure the temperature of it or put it on a scale. It might be something that exists in some sort of a quasi reality setting, uh, where it's, it's real, you're experiencing it, but it doesn't exist in a physical form that's entirely possible that that's our future. It's entirely possible that we through technology, figure out a way to create not just an alternative dimension, but infinite alternative dimensions, infinite alternative existences. So this idea that we're just going to get to a certain point where we realize that a, we could build a spaceship the size of the empire state building and fucking shoot off to Alpha Centauri and set up shop there and, uh, you know, find some snails and turn them into people. I don't think so. I don't think we're going to be traveling.

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       I really, I don't think that's the future. I think, uh, I think we may for the next foreseeable future, for the foreseeable future, we might be sending robots to Mars like we're doing now and might send them off to Pluto on to these other planets. And we might get invaluable data about the, the nature of our solar system. And you know, there's this planet that they think is outside of Pluto's orbit it past the Kuyper belt. Now they're calling planted acts and people have talked about this forever. There's some Chai and asked planted out there. That's, I think it's more than four times larger than earth and they're pretty sure it exists, like 90 something percent. Sure. Yeah. That's all awesome and fascinating and amazing and beautiful. But I don't know, I have a feeling that our future doesn't exist in a physical sense, the way we think it does.

Speaker 2:          01:25:48       I think we're married to this idea because it's all we've ever known, but I don't necessarily think it's all we're capable of. I think it's entirely possible that one day we might create a whole new world. And this also might be possible with the advent of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is another fucking rabbit hole because if you want to, you want to get your mind blown. Listened to. Not, I don't think it was the last one. I think Sam Harris and I have talked about it twice. Um, we talked about it on a think the last podcast and maybe even more in depth the podcast before it might be both of them. I'd have to go back. Remember, I've done more than 800 fucking podcast now. So even though my memory is pretty decent, I really lose track of which one was what and what was happening when, but, uh, the point being, the conversation that I had with him about artificial intelligence was a mind blower, a real mind blower where it's in my, in my eyes.

Speaker 2:          01:26:57       It's one of those things, just like we're talking about technological innovation. I think everyone would say everyone. I mean just it conservative people that are dreamers. If we start talking about the potential for the future, uh, are, is there going to be innovation? Yes. Everyone would say yes. Everyone. Everyone would say yes. If people don't blow themselves up, if we don't get hit by an asteroid, if yellow stone doesn't explode and wipe out everyone in North America, will we continue to make better electronics where we continue to innovate, where we will, we continue to make new inventions? Everybody would say yes. Everybody. Well, if that's the case, artificial intelligence is almost inevitable. If it's a hundred years from now, if it's 200 years from now, whatever it is, one day, eventually they're going to figure out a way to make something that can think for itself. He Tesla has fucking cars that drive themselves.

Speaker 2:          01:27:57       Now you can press auto drive or whatever the button is. He depressed and these fucking things will drive. They hit the brakes, they make turns. They follow the navigation system. They have sensors that detect cars. They break at traffic. I mean, it's fucking nuts and it's just crept up on us. Nobody saw this coming 10 years ago. Nobody thought in 10 years, nobody thought in 2006 10 years from now, we're going to have drivable driverless cars, cars that you take your hand off the wheel. There's a hilarious photo of a guy. They snapped pictures of him on the highway, I think it was outside of San Francisco where he was asleep, asleep at the wheel going to work and his car was driving down the highway. This is, this is all new, right, and what is it going to be like 10 years from now? I don't think we know.

Speaker 2:          01:28:46       I think we could guess. I think we could have beautiful ideas, but I think when every new invention gets created and every new door that gets opened up by new technologies, it, it creates the potential for a gang of other new exponentially increasing new technologies. So with artificial intelligence, I think it's entirely possible that we can literally create something that creates universes, something that creates universes that don't exist in a physical sense. Like you go to the Moon, you pick up moon rocks, it come back to earth, but rather something that exists in another dimension that we find portals or gateways or that we find frequencies. I've always thought that it's, it's possible that planets themselves or that a rather reality itself is like a station on the dial. And I've read that scientists believe that there are at least 11 dimensions. I don't know how they understand this.

Speaker 2:          01:29:58       I don't know how they, they, that's when they get to those, you know those yellow legal notepads where those guys scribble shit down on it. Your little, what the fuck is that? But you have to be a theoretical physicist to in order to understand what the fuck they're writing. I think those guys have come up with some equation that they all agree upon where they believe that it is entirely possible that there are 11 dimensions at least. And this is today in 2016 right? If you ask scientists in 1955 they probably look at you, look, you have fucking three heads. That's a blink of an eye. 1955 compared to 2016 it is a blink of an eye. It seems like 60 plus years for us. But it ain't shit in terms of the world in terms of human history and in terms of the, you know, the, the evolution of this bizarre talking monkey.

Speaker 2:          01:30:57       It's a, it's nothing. And in that time things have changed in spectacular ways. I think it's entirely possible that through especially the invention and innovation of artificial intelligence and its ability to innovate, it's ability to improve upon ideas that human beings have created. Cause that was one of the most mind blowing parts about the Sam Harris' podcast was he said that within weeks they will be able to do 10,000 plus years of what would take us as far as innovation. So the world will change so fast once artificial intelligence is, is when once it goes alive, when skynet goes live, the world's going to change so much that it's almost impossible for us to understand. It's impossible for us to guess I'm standing up here now cause I'm Kinda freaking myself out and my throat is getting a little scratchy.

Speaker 2:          01:32:01       That's what I think about the Fermi paradox. I think. I think that we're going to outgrow this idea of being somewhere in a physical sense. And I think that if there are aliens, they're going to contact us through our own minds. They're going to contact us through dreams. They, they, I mean aliens might exist in the form of imagination. Imagination itself might be like a kind of energy, like a kind, almost like a life form. If you look around at the world, obviously you imagination is something that you know, it comes out of the brain and people create things and it's just, you know the idea that it's a light farms ridiculous. I get it. Yes, you're right. But the imagination is responsible for every single physical thing that human beings have ever created. This building that I'm in right now came about because of the imagination.

Speaker 2:          01:32:56       The phone that I'm talking on came about because the imagination without the thought of these ideas, without someone saying, hmm, what would happen if we took this mud and turned it into a square and then dried it out? Can we make a brick? Ooh, and then if I stack a brick on top of a break, dude, I'm making a wall. And that all came out of the mind. It came out of an idea. How amazing would it be if we found out that those ideas themselves were alive, that that is the way these lifeforms express themselves much. What much like the way disease expresses itself inside your body. Like when you catch a cold, right, you, you have a life form that's growing and feeding off of you and your body's out of balance. Your immune system is battling this virus, this dizzy. You could look at it on a microscope.

Speaker 2:          01:33:58       Ooh, look, it's the staff virus or it's the flu. Oh, it's malaria. Ooh, he's got the malaria virus. Well, what is that thing? Well, that thing is a life form. It's some sort of an existing living thing that's trying to multiply, multiply, and grow. And ultimately it would like to keep, it would like to kill your body. It would like to take your body over and it would love to spread itself to a bunch of other people and, uh, take out a bunch of folks. And that's what happens every year with the flu or every year with malaria. And if you want a harrowing tale of what it's like to that malaria, listen to my friend Justin Wren, who's been on the podcast many times, uh, who was just on the last episode, who goes to the Congo regularly to uh, build wells for the pygmy. It's just an amazing guide, just beautiful person who is doing this incredible thing and helping these people.

Speaker 2:          01:34:52       But some motherfuckers caught malaria three times now. It's scary shit. It's malaria is some sort of a weird life form, right? What if ideas where lifeforms, they're just life forms that exist in a nonphysical way and you can make yourself more accessible. You can catch these ideas better. You catch these life forms, you can catch these things that will ultimately lead to the transformation of the very world around you. They've developed air conditioning. These ideas have made heat. They figured out how to harness fire. They figured out how to take rubber tires and put them around metal wheels, attach it to a frame and allow you to fall asleep and side of as it takes you to work. That's all because of imagination. Knows that that imagination is something that you can't measure. It's not a physical thing. You can't, you can't show it. You know, you don't take, I'll go a litmus test.

Speaker 2:          01:35:50       You can't go to the store and hey, I tested positive for imagination. No, it's, it's just there and you access it and you, you, you sit around your daydream and you lay on your back in the grass and you come up with an idea. What the fuck is that? We don't know. We don't know. We totally take it for granted. But if you look around this fucking spectacular world that you see in front of you when you step outside of your house, this bizarre world. But if you lived in a, in a natural world, if you lived in a jungle or if you lived in a, in a mountain setting and you had never seen human civilization, you were confronted with it for the first time, you would freak the fuck out. You will be like, what kind of bizarre thing is creating these enormous structures with a glass and stone and on a scale that is, it is impossible to comprehend a human being creating a skyscraper one person.

Speaker 2:          01:36:52       No, no, no. They had to work together. How many people? Hundreds. Okay. How'd they do it? They have metal. They use machines. What machines? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They have combustion engines with that. Well, they're explosions controlled explosions inside of a metal structure that that powers these gears and these gears can lift up things thousands of pounds and carry them through the air and then they, they put these glass walls on top of these buildings. Like what the fuck? This is all because of the imagination and this, this, this idea that the imagination is just some sort of like, oh, he's imagining things old, silly. He's a dreamer, has been kind of putting our heads since we were young, because we're, we're taught to be pragmatic or we talked to talk, to be disciplined and taught to, to, you know, to go out there and get things done and pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And all these, like a hardcore sort of a, I dunno what the word I'm looking for, organic ways of looking at productivity in life, but ultimately this imagination is going to lead us to create something that can change the very nature of what life is. So if that made any sense at all to anybody but me, I'd be fucking shocked.

Speaker 2:          01:38:14       But that's my answer. God Damn, that was a long ass fucking answer. Um, is almost seven o'clock here and I got to leave soon. So maybe I'll answer one more thoughts on the Putin, Russia, trump implications around the democratic party. Wiki leaks, email reveals. I think that they were saying that people were saying that trump was going to get in trouble because he told the Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails or hack the democratic, um, party wikileak emails. That's ridiculous. That is really ridiculous. I think that is one of the dumbest things. This idea that trump should somehow or another be accountable and held accountable for espionage. How about the fact that that the Democrats were plotting against one of their own? How about the fact that we're working towards getting Hillary Clinton to be the the nominee for the party. They're working towards that like they're supposed to be impartial.

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       He's a Democrat too, and they were actively trying to make her be the, the representative for the Party and then when the woman who has to step down because the emails, she has to step down because it's revealed that they were actively plotting to get Bernie sanders in his, or excuse me, Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. She, after she steps down, immediately gets hired by Hillary Clinton like immediately. It's, it's so transparent. It's hilarious. I think what I was saying earlier that one of the good things about a guy like Gary Johnson is we're realizing how stupid this fucking two party system is. We're being hosed. Whether you're a hillary supporter or whether you're a trump supporter, you have to admit that they're not ideal. Neither one of those people is ideal. You see all those people that are at the Democratic convention and they're all smiling and laughing and they don't really believe she's ideal. They believe this is all we have right now. Hillary Clinton was giving a speech and her fucking husband bill fell asleep. He fell asleep. I mean, apparently he's not in good health right now. It's not doing so hot. But he's sitting there in the audience and if he, if he's in such bad shape that he can't stay awake, he should be in bed somewhere. He, he fell asleep in the audience. That's how fucking boring and stupid these things are.

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       And it's a hose job and it's a hose job that I think is just going to be here for a little while longer. It's going to be like powdered wigs. It's, it's, it's a nonsense way to run a nation of 300 million informed people. There's too many of us now. There's too many of us and people know too much. It's not 18 hundreds where you needed this sort of representative government because you couldn't get to those people and they couldn't get their into their opinion to you. That's, it's not the case anymore. We live in a different world. Um, that's it. I'm going to end, I'm gonna end this fucking thing. Um, I'm going to try to get Ian Mccall on and either I'll attach it to this podcast or put it on a second one depending on how much Ian and I talk, but this one has gone for an hour and 34 minutes, which is I was like, what the fuck am I going to talk about?

Speaker 1:          01:41:55       Meanwhile, I couldn't shut the fuck up. And it's weird when I'm doing these things because you're trying to not be conscious of the fact that you're doing why sayings started. Just trying to like let the thoughts flow. But in the meantime it's like you have to resist the urge to think about the fact that you're talking and that you're talking into a phone and that you're trying not to fuck it up and you're trying to be as honest and transparent about your thoughts as possible while still make an entertaining. Don't say too many ums. Don't ramble too much. It's weird. I've done these before in the past, but I haven't done one like this a long time. It just shows you how talented bill burr is. Cause that fucking guy does one of these every Monday and every Thursday. Bill Burr, if you haven't heard his podcast, it's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:42:41       It's the bill burr Monday morning podcast, but he also does a Thursday version of it, which I think he calls the Thursday afternoon and Monday morning podcast. But, and honestly, bill is, um, he's a good friend of mine and a brilliant comedian and he's also a guy who's singular in his focus. And a, I really admire him as a comic and it's one of the things I was thinking about when I was thinking that maybe I would stop doing commentary. I'm like, this fucking guy just does stand up. I mean, that's what he does. He just does a stand up and look at the results. They're amazing. He's always got new shit. He's always killing it. I love watching his act. He's Oh, consistently funny, but he's very singular in its focus. And, um, anyway, I'm rambling. Uh, Bill Burr, Monday morning podcast. Check it out. It's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:43:28       If you haven't heard of bill before as a comic, he's not just one of the best alive today. He's one of the best average. He's one of my all time favorite standup comedians. So with that, let's end this fucking thing. So, uh, thanks for tuning in. Um, I'm, I may do this again or I might be completely fucking burnt out or I might freak myself out about how God damn I sound when I start rambling about artificial intelligence and the, the birth of alternative dimensions and universes out of the mind of monkeys.
