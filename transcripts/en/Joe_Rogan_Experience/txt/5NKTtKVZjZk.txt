Speaker 1:          00:00:00       They got this all done. Boom. Live. Okay. What the fuck will you just tell me? Hi Matt Farah, what's funny? You can see again, we're just talking about Rolls Royce. Yeah, because I was hearing your in your new baller studio, which congratulations. Thank you. Sick admiring your skylights. And we were discussing the Rolls Royce and uh, the starfield ceiling they do, which is they put all these fiber optic lights into your headliner and it looks like the stars and it's, I think it's 15 grand option, but I bad ass. So bad. So bad ass. And not only will they do it so you can get your standard star pattern, which is just whatever the guy, just random random lights or they'll make you exact constellations if you prefer writing, like if you were one of those astrology pdf or they will make you, you know, the sky directly above your house if you give them a coordinate, there's a photo of a bad ass bad ass.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       It's like so awesome. You are, you're balling so hard. You were driving around with a car with stars in the roof. Well, so the last thing I said before you hit live was that they have just announced they have come out with a shooting star, so I don't know how it works. I'm not sure exactly what, but I guess you could do. You can get shooting stars and you're crazy. What are they going to do to make the whole thing a big lcd pattern or something? Yeah, I guess or I dunno. I guess you can. You could have run on an led or a fiber optic line that, that works in a kind of a train. I, I emailed once I got that press release because I get press releases and I just delete them. I don't, you know, but when I saw a shooting star ceiling, I responded kind of further info in video on this and they said they'd get back to me.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       So I've never even been in one of those things. Never. No, no. You must, you must. What is it like in there? It's like sailing yachting. Phil Hartman had a really, really old, I think it was an old Bentley. I mean like really like sixties old, old, older than that, like 30 years old. It was fucking old man. I wish I paid attention to cars back then, but back then it was when I just started getting on TV. I really didn't. I, you know, when, when I was broke, I always loved cars when I was a kid. But then I was broke. My attitude was like, don't think about some shit you're never going to be able to afford, so just don't think. Look at you now. Joe Rogan with all the toys somewhere to park them somewhere to park them. But he had this old ball looking thing. It was like, it was like something out of a citizen Kane. Oh yeah. Just this incredible boat and you know, like pontoon fenders, the whole deal. Thank you. Shifted it on the tree. Probably I would say if I had to guess something ball or that Phil, like I would say Bentley, continental [inaudible] would be the most likely. It might've been a candidate that's a stunning automobile, but he loved that thing. He would just have this giant smile on his face with that thing. It was,

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       oh, he loves cars. That's great. Phil Hartman's bit like that. I wish I could remember because like I said back then like if you asked me to do like there's cars that I don't know shit about like rolls royces or Bentley, but if you show me like an old porsche, I'd be like, oh, that's a 73 long nose. I know that we all have our areas of nerdom, like muscle cars. I can. I'm a good muscle car guy. Understand most muscle cars. Like you could pick them out in the lineup, but. Well, Bentley and Rolls Royce were, are a weird one because they have sort of this intertwined history where they were separated and then they became together and then they became separate again. So there's a lot of rolls. Royce's and Bentley's that are mostly the same car. Those are, that's like super baller level. Were you like, okay look, forget about it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Let's just get a car that's makes no sound like you can't say anything. Hoses are really amazing cause they're so fucking cool. Dude, I can imagine, and even like to uh, a lot of car guys, especially like, you know, you are such like a manual transmission, you know, you want your car, I know you, you want your car to be like really close to a race car. I can be in dirty, gritty, like I wanna I wanna feel the rocks as our drive over them for you would, you would appreciate a Rolls Royce is ability to make a hundred percent of that disappear. You know what I'm saying? Like disappeared entirely. And like there's really neat details. Like you are the word flying or floating or sailing is so true because you don't really drive it. You just kind of fucking will it down the road.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       And you know how like you're, you're a porsche or a sports car will have like the thumb grips on the wheel at night and three. So Rolls Royce has thumb grips at four and eight. Really? You drive them? Underhand gangster. Extremely gangster under. See, let me try that. Let me feel this. It's that you. Yeah, it's underhand. Yeah. Because you don't even lift your arms above shoulder height and then you know your car has a tech commoner, right? It shows you your Rpms. Is there a rough indicator of how much power you're using? Right? Roughly? Not exactly, but before people go crazy about the lack of a technical term, rolls royces, don't have tech amateurs. They have a power reserve gauge which shows you how much power the car has, but that you are not using at any given time. Whoa. Right. So if you're, if you're coasting along, it's at 100 going down a hill.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       Maybe you're just off the gas off the brake, coasting. There you go. Power Reserve. So if you're coasting, you're using zero percent of your engine and the idea is to keep that gauge low because you want to be able to pass cars and cruise down the road while using 25 percent of this car's engine. So. And they're stupid horsepower, right? Like crazy bomber, right? Like not like crazy crazy. But like for four to 500. So. Hi. Yes. Hi. Hi. Hi. Yet, isn't that funny that saying that it's not that hard for car of today, our standards are so crazy blown out. Our standards or the Internet has fucked us all up. You gotta understand. I was reading about a new Miata, which by the way might be like one of the most underrated cars ever. The new MIATA. Lovely. Lovely. Yeah, they're great. Like for the bang for the buck, for a fun little car to drive that Kinda has real nimble.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       That's around their fucking great. But it was only like a hundred and 50 horsepower that's there it is. That's the new Miata. One hundred and 60 horsepower. I think that's like, you hear that and you're like, what? Yeah. But you know there's a company in Colorado called Flying Miata, you know them, right? You know where I'm going with this. Yeah. They put an ls three in one of these. So I drove on that has a 575 horsepower ls three and it's fucking great. That must be insane. It's great. You know why? Because it's got these long legs, you know, like it's a little car, but it's got the corvette long legs. So your third gear's good for like 90. Wow. That's great. Now when you're driving a car like that, is the balance fucked up by then? No, it's actually similar weight it, it's, I think, I think the ls conversion, it's like a, I don't want to say exactly, but it's like maybe that's the older car, Jamie, that they do it to a newer one as well.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       It's like a few extra pounds in the front, but actually they have to use the rear differential from a Camaro. So a lot of the extra weight goes in the back and so the cars maybe a hundred pounds heavier with the v eight in it, but, but it's four times the weight of a Miata, like 2150. That so like. And then you see that that thing in the picture was called an extra set which is so that, that exoskeleton thing that says flying me out on it. Oh this is an interesting photograph actually. Sorry, podcast people. We've got to two vehicles on a track from flying me out of the one in front is a an exoskeleton car with really no body work on it at all and that's called an excess set and so what is, you buy that chassis and you buy a Miata and you take apart the Miata and you put all the Miata shit on this chassis and so you end up with a 1200 pounds things and you can put turbos and you can put vh and you can do all different kinds of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:08:26       Is it street legal? Yes, it is street legal, car legal. And then the thing is called a bower cat fish. Did you say carb legal like as far as like a missions? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean if you use a car legal, like the Iraq engine, like, like John Ward likes or the stock Miata engine for sure. Yeah. If you use a carb legal engine, it's a carb. It's California legal. That's crazy. I've driven them there fast, but you know, not nothing about excess sets design should be taken from this statement. I don't feel safe in them. You know what I'm saying? I'm not trying to insult or the open. Yeah, it's just, it's to me, I like having a body around me, but it's way safer than a motorcycle. True. But a motorcycle. I was thinking about this. A motorcycle offers an experience that cannot be replicated and if you are going to take the kind of risks involved in riding a motorcycle, that experience is kind of worth it in to, to me in short bursts.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       Whereas I don't think the experience of driving a car with no body on it is worth you. I don't think teachers either, but fuck. Because you can get a lot of awesome car with bodywork. Yeah. But it's also like the thrill of the motorcycles, like it is either you either have it or you don't, like you're either in a convertible or you're on a motorcycle and the, and the leaning of courses is really. And is that thing any more thrilling than a regular convertible? Honestly, I mean it's faster. Um, it's not faster than all convertibles, but having the no, uh, you know, the no roof. I mean, you just feel connected to the elements. It's crazy and you can go because it's so light, you know, you can use an a relatively mundane engine and go very, very fast. Yeah. Imagine 1200 pounds. Yeah. It's nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       It's nothing. You know, and you put up. Imagine, imagine a corvette engine in that thing, which you can do. You know? I mean, yeah, people are crazy. I dropped some shit. That is dangerous. I know you're one take video series that you do where you're kind of people let you drive their fucking crazy hot rods. No souped up cars. Like, Wooh. I've just retired from driving people's personal cars. Yeah. Yeah. Good for you. I just saw this. I might go to reno and Brenda says this, this is these weird software guys built this thing in Reno that's called a test Salon de. That's a. Did you hear anything? No, you didn't. It's electric. That is a tesla drive train in a 1981 Honda and it weighs, it weighs 200 pounds and it, it runs like an eight second quarter mile a hilarious. Right. He just loved that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       This people like that out there, the nerds are winning. They're winning 100 percent. Yeah. The tests Londa Yup. So I'd, I'd, you know, weird shit, but um, I, I figured out I have rolled the dice, you know, you gotta know when to walk away, know when to run. Nowhere to count your money. Yeah. I think the dealing's done, I'm sure. Yeah. Good for you. You made out one of the rare few that beat Vegas. I mean, either I decide when to stop or a lawyer does. You know, that's so true. Um, I just, what we were talking about, it's just so amazing that the horsepower wars it because of their steady increase every year, you know, you come out with a 2018 corvette, people expect it to be faster. It's always got to go, hey, we got the same thing. Hey fucking it just put a new engine and the Mustang 3:50 gt.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       And so there's always something, hey, they got the gt 500 coming. Well, shit, I'm going to go up to 900 horsepower. Like isn't it crazy that it's just my money, like not even a lot of money. Like you can get a hell cat for used hellcat, like 45 grand, you know what I mean? Like 600 bucks a month, 700 bucks a month and you got 700 horsepower. You hooked me up with one of those when I was in Denver when I was fingering the central red hellcat mountains. I remember that with the astronauts outfit on fast. Right. Great. It's a great car. Now they have a wider. Have you seen the wider bodywork? I like that. It's actually got quite a lot more tire under. That was good. I had a complaint. It doesn't have that muscle car ass. I like a car with the wide body.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Hellcat does. Yeah. There's something about those fat tires in the rear is an old school muscle had dork. That's what you want. I saw a motivator. Matt de Andrea? No, he was on Adam Carolla's. Podcast card does car guys. He just posted a picture on twitter of Esau. Your old sick fish spotted somewhere. That's funny. It was not in a. It was not in the, it was in a bit of a sad state, honestly. It wasn't really just, it was a little tired and beat up one of the picture. Yeah. Someone and that's unfortunate. Yeah. It was a cool looking car when that thing came out. Yeah. That football player, Reggie, what's his name was Reggie Bush. He bought it. Oh really? He bought it off. The guy that I sold it to thing hasn't been around. Yeah. It's a great looking car that, that year, like all those years, like 70, 71, those, those second generation barracudas.

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       That's a special look and I think a lot of the hellcat is in that same kind of. It's pretty close. It's pretty close, but I really wish it was the same size. A hellcat is a hundred and 25 or 130 percent inflated, overinflated scale version of that. That's those, those 70, 71 Kudos are, are the most valuable muscle cars that there are today. Those Hemi ones right at the Hemi. Kudos are the rarest and most valuable of the. Of those they, they're the ones that only get, uh, over over, over, like a million usually. That's incredible. For car. That was what? $30,000 new back in 1970 $5,000. Was it? Was it $5,000? I don't know. My reverse map doesn't go back that far. Really? Let's take a guess. Let's say I think like five to 6,000 wouldn't be out of the question. Hemi Cuda. Alright, perfect motor. Let's go with 8,500 8,500 bucks. Okay. You go with 8,500? What did I say? 30,000. I'm going to read. Reevaluate. I think you need to reevaluate. And four slash 26 Hemi Cuda. I'm going to play a dirty game. Prices, right? I'm going to go right above it. Was Jamie coming in with a dollar fucking assault? Love winning the show for 2016 for Twenty six Hemi Cuda. Which year? Nineteen 77. Yeah. Years. That's the goodyear.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Well, the two years of my favorite year of 70 and 71. Seventy one and the same. I think 70 one's got four headlights. Two. Yeah. 70 also has the smaller grill face, like the teeth are small in the front, which is what I had. I had a 70, whereas 71 has the full real. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really more aggressive. I think 71 might be a little bit better looking, to be honest with you. I can't recall if one year is more valuable than the other. Seventy one I think is probably the best. Are the results in Jamie window sticker? Yeah. Thirty four, 33, 3000. Four hundred and $33. Oh my God. But Dalton with Jamie's $1 when I want it. That's. There it is. Yeah. Jamie, pull up 1971. Barracuda knows that is a. that's my. I think my favorite look and any muscle cars in 1971.

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       Barracuda. That's just like this aggressive American some. I mean that is. That is about as fucking aggressive as a grill can get. It's got a mouthful of teeth. It looks like a Barracuda really does actually fucking nailed it, man. They were better at actually, I think naming things, what they looked like back then. God Damn. That looks good. I do still think the corvette stingray looks sting ray. I think that's still a little bit. The works kind of. That looks like a fucking Barracuda though. It does that. It looks like it's going to get you. I just found a way for you to spend another million dollars, Joe Rogan. I would never buy one of those. I don't like. I'm weird with Shit. I don't like stock old cars. What cars they drive, like garbage. That'd be why. Yeah, I zero interest in them. You got your vet, right?

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       But that's like a modified bob pro touring chassis and all hundred percent. Yeah. And it's got a [inaudible] oh, so it drives a supercharged. Yeah. It tries to have a normal car charger driven. The stock one of, of that year. No, it's not good. You're lucky guy up the street. He hates me. He, uh, we, we live in the same block and he's got an original. Who's one of those original guys? He drives around with a paper boy hat on and drives around the neighborhood lawn chair at cars and coffee and play fucking music. Fuck those people out of his face. When I told them that it was, none of it was original except to shell. I go, it looks original. It doesn't have a goddamn thing in it. The inside, I guess the shape of the dashboards original. Oh, Kim. Well, he's just. I was like, look man.

Speaker 3:          00:17:16       I liked him to drive like a car. That works good. Yeah. Like why is it bad to upgrade the brakes? No, it is not. You're fine. But this whole thing that it's somehow another like doing a disservice to the vehicle by upgrading the brakes. These people are assholes. Was cmps man. It's an awesome if you're. If you're going on the lawn at Pebble Beach, you keep it original. Yeah. Other than that, I mean especially look you ever. I mean you, you love the depths of the Internet. Look at Los Angeles driving circa 1960 and then Los Angeles driving today. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       the heat, the traffic on an old car is not meant to handle that shit. You want to drive an old car here. You need to upgrade a few things. Cooling breaks. When I find out that a dude just drives an old car, I give them an extra level of respect. You know what he's going through? He, Jimmy Smith, my partner in the UFC now, uh, he used to work for Bella tour and now he works for the UFC. He drives a 1968 firebird everyday. Stock Stock, stock, seats, brakes, everything. I'm like, whoa. Does he know what he's missing? Have you let him driven drive your empire the fuck he doesn't give a fuck. He likes old muscle cars. He likes in the way they are. He had a Camaro I think, and I think his Camaro got hit by some asshole and totaled it. So he's like, all right, there's another one guys in my hood in Venice where I live.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       There's a lot of old, old daily drivers for sure, but I don't know, I can't do it. I just don't need that. In my experience. You've got to realize that you're not gonna be able to hit the brakes real good. That's not worth it to me. I like to drive too close to the people in front of it. Well, even if something steps out in the road, you know. I mean, how many times have you been driving in a deer steps out in front of your conch? A bunch. I was driving down the road in a video that's been viewed about $3, million times and a guy was dragging a log on like a 50 foot chain behind a ford explorer back and forth across the road. Oh my God. What the fuck was it? The most viewed video on Reddit for 24 hours. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       It was crazy. Just dragging a log, like a, like a log, like you know, four feet by two feet. Giant tree trunk log. Fucking assholes out there. You can't have shitty suspension like woop, woop member trying to turn one of those cars. Literally like a boat. Oh my God. But you know, what else is like, tires is a big difference too. Like, you know, old Porsche's used to be called widow makers and shit, but you take one of those old seventies turbo Porsche that you know, there's volumes about how scary they are to drive and you put them on Michelin Pilot Super Sport and you're like, oh you, you thought 300 horsepower was scary. That's cute. Funny. You were scared of 300 horsepower. Here's my log video. Look, wait, watch this. Boom log. That is so crazy. That is so god damn crazy. You sitting there going what?

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       And I was in a supercharged Lamborghini Huracan making like 900 horsepower. Look at that and look at the road. This guy is just free dragging up. Fucking that guy. Just not seem wise, but I totally, I, I choked. I mean I had an opportunity to, to throw a zinger there at this person and instead I just talked to myself and drove away. No, you're better off. You're not going to fix that guy if he's so stupid. He's driving a giant log down a public road 30. Look on the other side of the road. Look at the marks like the log. Actually, as I go up, you can see the mark of dirt like moving back and forth across the road. It was easier to see the other way I guess. But yeah, Jesus don't do that. People. Yeah, I mean I guess he couldn't pick it up. It looked too big. So I guess I don't see how that's an appropriate. So why would he be so convinced that the log is going to stay attached to the chain? I don't know. How much does he know about logs and chains, you know, and he seemed like an advanced chain scientists in the specialty of logs. Fucking assholes out there, man. Dragging a log behind a car on a public road has a big ass log to log, right?

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       That chain is not going to hold up. That law is going to bounce and go through someone's fucking windshield. God Damn Man, they got. It wasn't mine. It was borrowed like look, look how long it is. It's so crazy and I mean now that we need to like, you know, go back in the video, but she, that trail of whatever its leaves on the road, they're like that trail. I had noticed starting like a couple, like half a mile or so before that on the road and the trail is going back and forth across both lanes of traffic and there was a couple of signs down, some crazy shit to. You mean you're making obstacles for people that are driving, especially if you're on a motorcycle. If you're on a motorcycle and you're coming around, you're killing, you're gonna kill somebody. Yeah, that's legit. Like date motorcycles don't want sand on the road.

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       Yeah, they just don't. And you're putting it on the road 100 percent with that smokers. I also don't want to get clothes lined by logs and chains and my buddy a wiping out on a turn on some sand was one of the major reasons why I was taking motorcycle safety classes. I was trying to get my license and I was going to get me in a couple of my friends for fear factor. We were going to get a, we're going to get motorcycles, a couple of guys at work there and then as things went on, we were like, fuck this couple. They, they, two of them went through with it. Two of US bailed. Alonzo Boden is all about the bikes, the bikes, how many books he broke in. I don't know how he broke his arm on a bike a couple years ago. I bet he did. Yeah, he doesn't. He doesn't seem to, uh, think it's a bad risk.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       I ride a scooter. I have a little Yamaha scooter that I ride around Venice and running errands and going to my office and stuff like because I can lane split and it really makes my life a lot easier. Oh yeah. But I'm terrified. I had a motorcycle and I wrote it in the canyons maybe four or five times. I was terrified. I have no problem pushing a car, you know, a little bit in the canyons. But on a bike like that, gravel, it's like, yeah, it's really fun. I get it. Motorcycle people. I'm not saying you're wrong. You're, you're, you're braver than me. Yeah, I've fruit or I've done, I've gone through a lot of surgeries, I know what it's like to rehab from serious injury and like I am just so not into that I've, I mean I've had two back surgeries in the same, same spots.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       So you've had those disectomy, how was that? Did it work for you? Yeah, yeah. First one lasted 11 years and then my bad decisions led to it being reinjured and the second surgery was fine. I'm in the best shape now that I've been in, in like 10 years. So that's what you doing? I do seven days a week of cardio, so I built a gym in my house. I did just seven days a week of cardio. Yeah, I got one of those arc trainers. It's awesome. Is that like a sort of like an elliptical? It's like the hardest elliptical machine I've ever used and it's. I do like 45 minutes a day on that. I use one of those really recently. It was great. It's amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a hotel with the video that bad boy. It's a, it's like a hotel quality, so no pounding.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       You're getting your cardio in. Your body's not getting done in 45 minutes. I'll burn according to the machine. I don't know how accurate these machine counters are, but I'll burn like 850 calories in 45 minutes and then I do three days a week of weight training for an hour getting in daily doubles three days a week and I haven't. I haven't had a cigarette since October. Twenty 16. The ARC trainer. I have the one with the arms. Yeah. Yeah, guy behind them. It's get the arms. It's serious. Serious workout, man. I sweat. It is a really good workout. It really is. So and then I do speed back. I'll do 12 minutes a day on speed back, which I like. I decided to do this. You could do. That's what you. How you hurt your arm? Yeah. Yeah. We're, we've been talking about tendon issues, folks whose never had tendon issues and I never had them until this elbow.

Speaker 1:          00:25:20       I mean, I've had it on elbows before, but I did it smart and I didn't keep working out this time. I tried to meet head my way through it. Yeah. Again, uh, it, uh, it flared up pretty bad to the point where I'm four months later it wasn't healed. It's a slow healing thing, right? We're slowly tendons. They don't have any blood supply, so I got a bunch of shit. Does that, why the platelet rich plasma works so well because it just gets it right there. It's very effective. Yeah. The other thing that's I think the most effect is what we're talking about is those therabands and actually it's the cheapest twisty, a blue thing that I use. It looks like a big Avatar Dildo. And you hold it out in front of you. I wish I had it with me and then he twisted like that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       Yeah. And then I hold it like this and then I let it on. Yeah. So I just got one. And then you like. And when you do the untwisting it strengthens for, for me, that was my issue on the inside. I'm on the outside so I go the other way. Yeah, there would be. There's another one, they'll show they have diagrams with different things you could do, but it's different, but it's just those kinds of muscles don't get strengthened a lot. My muscles and my hands picking things up and I'm doing chin ups in rows and stuff like that. But I was never doing anything twisty. So started to add that the amount of driving I do isn't good for me. Right. For your back or my hands are for anything. It's flux on my whole body. Do you put a lumbar pad or anything? No, but most cars I drive have like real sporty, you know, seats and

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       a lot of them I'm lucky enough to have adjustable lumbar Mercedes right now is killing the seat game. Mercedes seed game is so fire. And what are they doing? Just they um, they work with this spinal center in Germany. Oh Jesus. To develop all their high end seats and the seats on the um, the s class, the amg s class is, are so ridiculous. Um, it's like he, they have it. Okay. So they have a simulated hot stone massage function that works. It's boss as hell. It's like a nine zone massage seat in the s class coupe. So while you're driving, it gives you a hot stone massage. What is the difference between a hot stone massage and a regular massage? The air pockets that get inflated, like you know, it's, it's like behind the seat, the leather. There's like these pockets of air, like old reebok pumps, right?

Speaker 2:          00:27:41       We're going to pump them up and inflate and deflate them in sequence to simulate needing or whatever it is. Well the Mercedes s class heats those pockets. So they're actually the not with hot air. The, there's a thermal thing on the surface. It's so gangster. Whoa. It feels like a hot stone massage. It's awesome. Yeah. They took it to the next level they have. And in fact I got the car, you know, it's like a $225,000 car and I got it for a week. I drove it around a road trip. All this. I ended up writing 2,600 words on the seat.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       The hot stone, the fit has the fans behind your neck that blow the hot air because it was a convertible, so. Oh, you got the convertible. God Damn, that's the backseat there. Jamie. Look at the. Go for the front seat because that's the. The. The front seats are just just delightful. It is, but it is amazing that we are in the zones six zones. It's amazing that we're in this time where the technology has gotten to this level where cars, they, they're working so hard to improve upon what is already ridiculous in terms of performance. Yeah, and have you, have you experienced any of this semi autonomous stuff yet? None. No, I haven't. I'm surprised as intellectually curious. Interested in cars that drive themselves. They can go fuck themselves. You're not interested in a brief experience into the world. I am. I am, and she should be Pam, but for the most brilliant mind cars, those cars are going to take away our right to Dr.

Speaker 2:          00:29:14       Oh, that's why you should join the human driving association. Alex. this is real. We're beginning of starting a lobbying association for the rights of human drivers. Will it sounds like a fucking goof right now, but it doesn't matter to me. No, it doesn't to me. Yeah. Because this, what we don't want to ever have is a situation where you summon your autonomous pod and you say, take me to wherever. And it goes, no, Joe, you're not going there today because some political situation. Yeah. The government tells you the war on driving is here. Pick your side. Oh my God. What the fuck is that? An Rs America on the left there. I think it's a sign. I think that is. It might be an older car by the career. A whale tail. Like my nine slash 11. Yeah. What years? Your nine slash 11. It's an 87.

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       Were built. We're doing a safari build. What does that mean? Oh, so you're making it like one of those offer rally cars. Car? Yeah. It's called, uh, the Kenya project. My friend Lee keen is a reporter racing driver and he built one for himself and it is the most glorious thing I've ever driven. And it's everything that you love about a nine slash 11 applies to this. I'm on loose surface. There it is. That's your car. That's not my car. My car is going to look like that, although it will be a different color and have a roof rack and it'll be, it'll be slightly, slightly different. That seems crazy. That actually is a Richard Tuttle build from England. He's a keen sofar k, e n and you'll see closer to mine tuttle's the guy that made a greencard. Oh, that's my. This is my video of driving lease car. Um, and uh, it is. See, look, I was fatter there.

Speaker 2:          00:31:01       So it's just drifty woods, oversteer and, and you know, the, that, that rear engine kind of snapped back thing that everyone's all afraid of. Nine slash 11. The pendulum thing. Will you get that when you slide and then it catches and comes back on a loose surface. There's no catch a. So you slide it, but you don't have the scary snap back. It just drifts in the gums back drift. You know, there's Lee, he's building the thing that's probably really good to have a rear engine bias. It is real, it is the most controllable. Delightful. And you've got four inches of extra suspension travel. So La speed bumps, ruts. Think about this in Los Angeles. Right? So you're going to drive this rally car around La? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not a race car. It's a street car. Wow. That's a streetcar. Yeah. And then, you know, that looks like so much fun trying to get in the dirt.

Speaker 2:          00:31:57       Oh my God. We have so much desert here. No one cares. You got to have Mirage. There's trails like there's no speed limits. Nobody gives a shit. I got to be honest. There's two videos that made me get really interested in older porsches. One of them was the Chris Harris build with the tuttle and another one was you driving that project? Nasty cough. Joey seely. He's a local as well. That car. I was like, oh, that's it. Yeah, that's it. Just like get it down to the raw dog. Yeah. He took everything out of that car. And Richard Tuttle, who did Chris's car in England is like the rally, you know, master. He's like, uh, there's, there's a project nasty. And there's joey who built it. And he also, I love the little things, he did make the exhaust come through the rear bumper and those funky wheels on it and the fact there's no carpeting and all, like everything inside was stripped away.

Speaker 2:          00:32:47       His instagram, his emotion engineering and that car has been through a few changes since this video has made. It looks a little different now that he changed the wheels. Right? Different wheels, different like stairs, a bunch of different stuff, but it's amazing. And that guy, um, he used to be a part of this business. BBI autosport. He left to go start his own business, emotion engineering. And he is a master of chassis setup. Yeah, I believe it. Yeah. That's a very, very impressive video. It's a very interesting video. And that's not like the highest horsepower vehicle, right? No, it was really light though. It was I think how many horsepower did have, I don't remember. Maybe three. Seventy five. Three 80. I mean it was, it was fast. It was not a slouch at all, but you know, have you seen what singer is doing now with this air cooled engine?

Speaker 2:          00:33:32       It's crazy what you sent me. That whole thing of the price difference between a nine slash 11 engine air cooled engine that's got 200 horsepower versus one's got $500 and be like, wow. Yeah, the exponential curve of Porsche horsepower costs. So it's really scary stuff. Stan was $250,000. Yeah, so it was like, okay, if you buy an engine, an engine on a stand, you want that engine. This is a porsche air cooled, so a porsche engine for a porsche that is earlier than 1995. I'm 300 horsepower is gonna run you about 40 grand and that's a ton of money for not a lot of horsepower. 400 horsepower will run you about 100 grand. I mean 100,000. That's an engine on a stand. Nothing else. You want 500 horsepower out of that motor seawater and $50,000 just for the end. Just for the edge. Why is that? Because that sounds so crazy in comparison to other cars because a lot of techniques that you would use to make horsepower and other cars you cannot apply to a porsche engine.

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       You're limited on displacement size, so it's not like you could shove like a nine Liter v eight in there, like a four point two is about as big displacement as you can get in that case. And that's with like a stroker crank and board out. So you're increasing both the length, the Pistons move and the size of the whole, um, to get to the 500 horsepower mark, you have to run some highly experimental cylinder heads and singer to do that. I don't know if Chris has been on the show recently, but he's working with singer to develop. Um, there's a company called Williams that has a formula one team. They are developing the cylinder heads for singer. So Chris Harrison is a part of this. He's doing development driving for them. That's great. Which is a good decision. That's amazing decision. Plus the videos will be epic, right? So most of a, they're doing a four valve air cooled head,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       which as far as I know has never been done before. All your, your engine, my engine, all the are our two valve engines and, and they're doing a four valve engine. So, um, it's going to cost a million and a half dollars. Well the engine is 250 grand. This is why it's so crazy. Custom cars or a million dollars. Now. Isn't that nuts? I mean you really want, if you really want something next level, it can easily be. Emily knows Jamie, pull up that new singer, nine slash 11 singer nine slash 11. And the Williams Williams engine. It's green, but it's got a lot of that. Um, what is, who's the Japanese gentleman who takes those porsches and our web? Yeah, it's got a lot of that to it. Well, alright, so our web is really interesting because in Japan there's the singer, don't you think that's a God damn gorgeous car?

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       Don't you think it's an odd choice to artificially different. Stop please. Sexy. That artificially differentiate like the way he's got the fender flares, he's just, he's making him like he had a glue them on carbon fiber. The whole car is carbon fiber. Why did, why did they fake like they had like extensions. Okay. So I don't want to disappoint you, but that is a rendering and not a picture of an actual car. Far as I know he actual car does not exist and I think if I had to guess they put those over fender lines on the rendering. So you would specifically notice that they have widened it a. That standard would be if I had to guess the final car may not actually have a seam there. You know what man? I'm not. I'm not mad if it does. It looks amazing. Champion. Can you make that bigger again?

Speaker 1:          00:37:16       It's so real. That's crazy that that's not a photograph like a render. Almost certain. That's not a real car. I'm almost certain it's not a real car. Hire little. I could be wrong. There could. There could be someone's screaming at their whatever right now saying I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure reflections in the window in the last three years. They're good at this dude. Well, I play a video game. I absolutely believe it. I'm not arguing against it. I'm just saying it's so good. Yeah, but anyway, if they'd make a car like that, Holy Shit. That's a gorgeous car. Oh yeah. And they will and it'll look like that, but it may not have those seams. It's pretty similar to what their car looks like wider. Much different than the wider. I saw one of those that might've been the best looking car I've ever seen in my life. It was a silver, like a metallic silver, like a bright silver singer, and it was online understated. It's like Lori's damn. See if you find that bright silver, a silver singer. Have you seen one in person before? A close dude, your mind would be blown. They have at a minimum, minimum 45 or $50,000 of leather in one of those cars and the interior, the leather work in the interior of those cars is unbelievable. Beyond anything from any manufacturer today. Really?

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Uh, yeah. That's it. That's a sexy motherfucker. Damn. That's a good looking car. Yup. That's very, very nice. What is it about certain shapes, right? There's certain. What singer does is they distill, you know, the best of each generation of car into one car. And so you're looking at a highly idealized nine slash 11, but you can't exactly picture what came from where and why. Yeah, it's gangster. And those folks, those wheels, for whatever reason, they just work like, especially that green car that we go back to that green card, they made them all they made. I'm real big on the green card, but the design works so well. There's the Williams engine. God Damn it looks good. Yeah, that's perfect. So scroll down Jamie the Williams. Look at this. So, so you see, look at the air intakes. That's where your rear windows would be.

Speaker 2:          00:39:28       So there are no rear windows, there are only those air intakes that go directly into the engine. Cool. That furnace off. That's. No, not cooling. That's the actual air intake to get the end of the combustion chamber. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The cooling, it's air cooled, so you see that silver kind of nipple on the right side there. That's the center of the fan. It gets cooled in from the back. They're like this is basically the same size as a regular inline six flats. Yeah. Yeah. Roughly that the engine itself is roughly the same size. Yeah. So what they've done is just engineer it to the Max. Oh yeah. Well they have the. They have what are inferior, the most advanced cylinder heads ever put onto an air cooled 9:11. It looks incredible and they're going to stick that in a car. That was originally what?

Speaker 2:          00:40:14       Ninety three, something like that. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, 91 to 94. Isn't it funny though that there's something unbelievably appealing about those air cooled cars that is willing to have these rich people pay a million dollars or at least the current singers? A half million dollars from this car just because you feel it more when you drive it. It's just got a feel to it. There's a certain kind of mechanical brilliance to it that's really, really. You can't. It's in comparable. Really. It's very unique. Yeah. Well, there's something about those old cars, particularly the ones that don't have power steering. You get a thrill out of them. There's a weird thrill even when you're not even driving fast, especially with a porsche when you. When you have no power steering combined with front engine car, it sucks when no power steering, when the engine's in the back is okay because the front of the car is pretty. Is Pretty light so you don't need too much muscle, but the nine slash 11 steering is just super, super direct. Yeah. It's super direct and it's just. I don't know, man. It just. It just feels like a different thing you're doing. I had a buddy that had a a folks wagon bug growing up, didn't have a lot of power in it, but those Volkswagen bugs, those fucking things like when you drive them around, they give you a little smile on your face because you're driving like

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       this little tiny thing that feels completely connected with the road. Very capable, but it's like you're smiling when you drive one of those. It's the ultimate Volkswagen is they're taking in Germany, they take the buses, the micro buses, and they and they chop them down so they're compressed and they put full porsche floor pan drive, train, and so remember that nine, nine, six turbo. You had the all wheel drive, so they'll put that whole floor pan on a microbus and they'll go to like track days and beat up on race cars. It's crazy. They're look seriously. Look, here's, here's one that is so crazy. Five hundred and 30 horsepower portion nine, nine, three by turbo powered Volkswagen microbus. Same. Look in the rear window. See the intake on the rear window there. That's so crazy. And that's on a racetrack. Oh my God. And it probably weighs nothing, right? Nothing. And I mean, look what happens. God forbid you crash one of those. Oh Wow. There's crazy people taking a vw bugs and put Porsche engines in them. I know they've been doing that. Yeah. Well the common one is a suit. Oh, the old 3:56 engines award. No, no, no. I think someone was putting an older nine slash 11 engine in it, or a nine slash nine slash 12, nine slash 12 engine.

Speaker 1:          00:42:53       Nine twelves are people are paying way too much money for them. Stop it. Yeah. They're like like 30, $40,000. Really? They're so slow. Yeah. That's a slow ass. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need to have like I get that. It's about feel and yet nine slash nine slash 12 slash five field, but at a certain point there has to be some pace associated him know when they made those cars it was the same shell on the outside. Is it nine slash 11? Yeah. Yeah. They just like d contented it cheap and everything and then put it interesting. That old engine, if somebody wanted a hot rod or nine slash 12 out and like put a crazy nine, nine three engine in it and to all the suspension, it would still be a nine. 12. Isn't that weird? There's people that convert nine twelves into nine slash 11 all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       Yeah. But people know. Yeah. Care. No, but that's what's so crazy about it is that you're essentially. It's the same good stuff is the nine slash 11, what it looks like on the outside, but do the numbers match. That's the thing, but the difference with Porsche people, I mean the difference between $40,000 and $400,000 will be the most minute insignificant bullshit of this one was delivered with, you know, leather covered vents and a leather covered fusebox and a fucking Fuchsia steering wheel and it had the lightweight glass. So that one's 400 grand in that one's 40. I mean that's really what it is. That's the only muscle cars. Same thing. This was one of four delivered and plum crazy and automatic transmission on a Tuesday with a white roof and a cum stain in the back feet

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       from the factory. I'd love those auctions where you see pitch to greed and people's eyes just go in off. The funny thing is when they people like will, they'll get in a bidding war and overpay for something by 40 grand and still feel like they want. They feel like they score. I'll give her lungs that motherfucker didn't get it. I went to Barrett, Jackson for the first time ever this year. I had to see it in person. It's a shit show. It's an, it's an absolute shit show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's crazy. And you know, it's in Scottsdale and, and, but a Barrett, Jackson itself, what they don't show you on TV is that you can buy anything. They're like, you can buy fat. They had a, uh, a jet turbine powered fan boats. Whoa. That you could buy like it's, it's like the auction and I'm going under and then like a mile of swap Midi Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       And you could buy custom made cowboy boots and tempurpedic beds and you know, home furnishings and terrible art and watches. And it was a massage chairs. Anything you can think of. Whoa. It was, it was just such a, like Sea of commerce dam and uh, there's like a lot of cars that don't make tv that are either amazing or very, very sad and in their own way. Do you have to do to get in there? Do you have to there like a quotation thing to just walk in? No, to set a car in there. Oh, you just, you on their website and apply to sell a car. I think. I don't think there's any. I think are happy to take your money and try and sell your car. I don't think there's any restriction guy like Eric Andre from going there I would like. And just pinto.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       I don't. I mean, I don't know. I don't think anything other than someone figuring out the joke before he did it, but I don't think much. I think you could probably do it, but for the most part it's people that are pretty serious about cars. It was a lot of dealers. There was a lot more dealers that seemed like they were selling to each other in terms of the actual buying and the selling. But yeah, I mean there's a lot of nascar jackets out there, lot of nascar jackets, and then you see the, they have some of the higher end options to which sort of resemble the pebble beach ones. Do you still have that crazy corvette? Sold it. Oh, I have a crazy mustang now. What'd you get? Oh, that one? Yeah. Yeah. It's on the cover of carcraft this month and it's in speed hunters as well.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       It did a great article in it and speed. Hunter's dad is a ridiculous car. It's awesome to her rutledge on your show and you guys were on Fox bodies. You were him called it like the worst piece of shit ever. Fuck you. Why did you decide to soup up that car? Because car what I wanted in high school, but like it's my highest. It's the high school, the high school reliving car. Oh Wow. We'll over the top. Imagine pulling up to high school with that thing. She'd go back in a time machine, bro. I went to my actual 10 year high school reunion in a orange Lamborghini as a goof and there was literally not a single soul outside when I parked it up upfront, zero people's arrival. It couldn't have been more that shit. Isn't that funny? Like that's what you want a car like that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       It's like 80 percent of rival. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred percent right? One hundred percent up and getting out. If they see the Lamborghini, there's my mustang and you see the Lamborghini on the way out of the reunion. It's really lame. It just was not the best looking year. No. Look, I have the notch back and the notch stack is better. Mine was a police car. Was it? Yeah, it was a highway patrol car. Wow. See that's the notch back there. And uh, it was cheaper to get those. I remember you can get the five point. Oh, engine. And the point of that is the police cars were the lightest ones. So no air conditioning, no sunroof, no fog lights, no power windows. Power door locks. So that was the Lightest v eight powered Mustang ever made. Look at my interior. I love crazy fabrics so much. That interiors, bad ass Cholo.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Fantastic. I actually like it. I thought it would hate that. Now it's like a seventies. Outdoor patio furniture. Keep that image back up there. I liked the um, we're getting joe and interior today. I can never go like that, but just leave that there. Like the gauges, man. Everything you did there. Porsche style steering wheel. I love that. I love the shifters at hearst. Yeah, her shifter. And then the center tray in between the recaro seats is from a 73 Mercedes to 80. And then, uh, the pattern came from a modern fabrics and it's like an outdoor patio furniture fabric. So it's uv resistant and spill resistant. What do those wheels Jamie Click on those wheels and the righthand side. What? Where the wheels. The wheels? I have a, it's called the hre rs one. Oh. Which is a three piece forged wheel. Uh, and I'm running to 95 tires at all four corners.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       So there are 18 by 10 and a half at all. Four corners. They're awesome. We must handle amazing. Oh, it's sticks. So it sticks like a gt three. It turns in so hard and I'm running the tires or sport cup tubes which are like the gt three tires. And what is this car way you think? Thirty one. 10. Well, so it's pretty good. It's got really good breaks, really good handling. It's medium fast. It's about 350 horsepower. So it gets quick enough. You're going to leave the engine the way it is? Well, it has a crate motor in it, right, which it could use some more, could use a little more and so if I keep the car long term, I'm going to take out that engine and put in the Gt 3:50 if I keep the car long term. How many horsepower is the GT? Three. Five, 25. But it revs to 8,200. That's what it's really about. You know, I heard one of those in a video. That's a great insight. Doesn't sound anything like a Mustang. It

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       doesn't, it sounds like a something, uh, more Italian. Yeah. Most. Yeah. I was going to sound like a Ferrari or. Well they do a different firing order and they also, I think it's, someone's going to hurry me if that's wrong, but the flat plain crank changes the sound gt 3:50 exhaust, 2018 gt 3:50. It's pretty glorious. Yeah. Well I'm terrified that they're going to come out with that gt 500 and I'm going to fall in love. It could happen. It could happen. It has a very uh, yeah, yeah. That sounds amazing. Nope, I think you have one of my videos open in the background, Jamie, because I'm hearing double God dammit Jamie Lists. But look at that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Oh, that sounds so good. It's not, it's a very unlike anything else on the road. Very distinctive. So that's uh, that's, that's uh, one of the most special engines. Thirty 700 pounds. They're all heavy. Why can anybody figure that out? Because people. Lighter people want features, right? Everybody though some people don't want that. That's why people like you and I are so fascinated by something like singer. I'm like, you don't want to spend that kind of money. You can't have light and cheap and fast. You gotta you gotTa pick one. If you want light and sheep, you, it's your Miata. You know, you can't have a. If they're, if they had a 3000 pound Mustang that had the features that people demand from a modern car, it would be $200,000. You'd, you'd have a Ferrari, you know? Yeah. But even for ours aren't that light anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       That's true. That's true. Nothing is like, well, what is the lightest thing you could buy? Like a Porsche boxster. There's a lotus. Lotus for 10 is under 3000 pounds I think, which is really, really, really, really nice car. I drove that little one to little league. Yeah, trove that a few years back. Yeah. So you've already beat you up like that. Does it didn't have any horsepower though? It was the other one? No, not the core of the. Exceeds the really the one where it doesn't have any floor panels. He doesn't have anything. I was like, this is kind of interesting because it's like a little go cart. It doesn't load us this thing. Yeah. Yeah. So that's what I drove. That's the evora sport for 10. I just drove that and it's really, really good. Yeah. Really Nice. And that's also a manual transmission? It is, yeah. It's a super charged camry engine, believe it or not. Really? Yeah. How many horsepower? Four hundred and 10. Supercharged carries. Beautiful car. It's really good looking and it stopped that thing. It's got a titanium exhaust. God, that's so unique. You know, in a sea of nine slash 11, it does stand out. Why you would like that car. I think that that would be a good one for you. Like you need another one. That's a

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       pretty cartoon, but that's the other one. That's the least. Yeah. Yeah. The elise is the one that I drove that gray one that you just clicked on. Jamie. I drove that. That's a beautiful looking car, but it's got no balls. No, but you can stun those. Like this is crazy how slow the is. They made some. You might have driven the smaller engine when they made some that were a little faster. Yeah. The base one was like 180 horsepower and then they go up to, to 60 or to 80. But there's something thrilling about it. Like driving a flea. Yeah. So how much does that thing way think? Twenty 500 or something. It's like, yeah, it's nothing and it's beautiful. They just make beautiful cars. Those lotuses are that. They will be $30,000 used cars until the end of time. The Elise? Yeah, absolutely. Bottomed out at 30 grand and you can buy them and sell them at 30 grand all day.

Speaker 3:          00:54:14       Isn't it funny how cars were worth almost nothing and then like a 73 Rs America. It wasn't. It wasn't an rs America just at Rs. Three RS is worth like a million dollars now. It used to be worth $20,000 just a few years ago. Like how did that happen? I remember I saw those for sale and someone saying this is the perfect Porsche. It's not the most powerful. It's only like 225 horsepower, something like that, but it's so light and so fun to drive. And I was like, get the fuck out of here with 225 horsepower. Well, it's like you know, the world, the world has become more automated, right? Everything is faster, more efficient, but less involved and less mechanical. And at the same time you've got a, especially with Porsche, a younger audience, a very wealthy audience, you know that as has really decided to use the older collector cars is a currency that you can drive and investments and just a lot of rich people out there right now.

Speaker 3:          00:55:14       And they're not making any more. Nineteen 73, nine slash 11. Yeah. That's one of the things that people have a real problem with, singer is they're taking those cars and chopping them the fuck up. I'd taken a nine, six, four and just chopping the shit out of that. Taking 100,000 dollar car and turning it into a $500,000 that if you can get on the list and get one and you take it home, it's immediately worth $700 on the open market. I bet. Right? Because people don't want to wait. Flipper market for a singer. It's like name your price. Name your price. If you wanted to get a singer, made it. How many years is even his waiting list? Two years. Three years. So two years. Three years for waiting list than a year to make the car and they're making it by hand with carbon fiber. It's crazy. I've seen the videos of people visiting the factory, putting together here. You should go. I should go, but I'm scared. I'll introduce you to it. I'll do it. I'll start doing numbers in my head. It's just all this. I mean and there's. And then there's a whole cut singer, I think. Not to dwell on singer so much, but they opened the door for a, a sub industry them that's

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       doing $200,000, you know, builds that are like halfway to singer for most people. That's probably like, yeah, that's cool. That's really fucking excessive. Most people I bought, you know I'm doing this safari thing, but I bought my 87 Carrera and its stock and I almost didn't want to start modifying it because it was just such a nice thing to drive around. It was just lovely. Well that's recent enough where they have like good breaks. Yeah. And it's a super light car. Eighties is good. I mean, I think that the, what's great, there's a, there's a, a series of shows now called Redwood. Yeah, it's a car show for eighties and nineties cars. A fucking great dude. It's great because these are cars you can drive, you know, they have air conditioning, they have reasonably, you know, modern, whatever. You could just start them up and drive him and do it.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       It's like old eighties benzes and, and just just as great, great scene of eighties and nineties cars at Rad when they've got a bunch of shows around come out and say hi. I met a bunch of them. But um, you know, people like my age, I'm 36, are seeing these cars as collectible now and it's going to usher in a new market to. There's a lot of good investments to be made. An eighties and nineties cars. Yeah. You know what I would say. That's crazy. These are good looking cars, dude. There's like, this is like an 86 Acura Acura legend that looks mint. A buddy of mine had a, an Acura legend just like that. He loved that thing. An 87, 87 legend. That's a great car. One car that I had that I wish I didn't get rid of. Prelude. It's so clean. I had the last year.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       The NSX. Oh really? The. Yeah, with the headlights. The headlights. You shouldn't have gotten rid of it. Got Rid of a big dollar car right now. It's hot. I don't have it. I loved it too. That was a light ass car. I don't know what those things weighed. Twenty eight, 28. I'll tell you what, if you like that car, that Lotus for 10 I just showed you. You would love that. That is the new version of that car. Really? Yup. I don't know if I want the new version though. I don't think I like the old version. That's the thing. No, no, no. The new version feels like the old version of it with like Bluetooth, Bluetooth and your base, etc. It is. Fuck. That was a great car. So lIght. They're very durable. You can drive them. Yeah. People who are hot and mean.

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       How did they figure it out? so much better than the americans did when it came to reliability? Well, they just built a light car and then put their accord engine in it. Pretty much. Yeah, but I mean all oF their cars. Oh, did you go through across the board, like we were talking earlier about land cruisers. That's like god would be one of the most reliable cars. The history of the free world. Like why the fuck are they so good at that? And most companies like american companies during that same age, like you get a 19 nineties ford. No, I know. It's terrible. That's terrible

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       running, right? Yeah, I know. But 1995 land cruiser driving through africa right now. Land cruiSers are specific or an interesting example specifically because I went on the press launch for land cruiser, so I know this. Most cars are built to a 10 year service life. The land cruiser is built to a 25 year service life. The land cruisers parts are almost 100 percent unique to land cruiser. They, they share very few parts with anything else in toyota's lineup and that's why you look at. You go, oh, iT's a full size suv. Why is this thing $90,000? Because everything on it is industrial grade shit designed to last twice as long as like any other car. Yeah, it seems like when you drive a one, two tanks, absolute absolute texts and there are over engineered, but I think in the, in the eighties and nineties, I think the japanese design and production philosophy was just so far beyond where we were.

Speaker 2:          01:00:17       Yeah. We were making shit during those years. Absolutely. I mean I have an 88 mustang you just saw. I have an 87 porsche and I had a 1998 nissan skyline gtr, the marsha and the fucking skyline. Our same time, save time period. They're spaceships compared to the hunk of shit that is my mustang. I mean those guidelines are bad ass. Awesome. Skyline. Yeah. Yeah. I sold it, but I doubled up in six months though there. Think about what they did with the gtr when they came in. When nissan came out with the gtr, the new, the new interest. Onewest one. Dude, I've only driven one of those twice, but one time when I drove one though, the most remarkable thing about it was I was taking a turn to to hit an off ramp and I was like a little late. I was like, oh, that's the law.

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       I got to change lanes and it just went like this, cross the lanes, zip you up, like nothing. No lien. There was nothing just defied physics. I was like, this thing is crazy. It's just, it's calculating how much mass is leaning this way and adjusting to flatten everything out electronically. So actually the new acura nsx, that's like the supercar you one second, 150 grand does that same thing that the gtr did and oh nine, but it does it much more seamlessly. So You think you did it really that awesome driving that just happened in the gtr. You're like, wow, the gtr is doing all this awesome shit in the nsx. You're like, I'm a fucking hero because you can't because it's so. It's so seamless. Like the gtr, it's a mechanical, you know, all wheel drive system with these clutch packs and whatever. So you can hear it like clunk, clunk, clunking around and like moving power and doing all this shit, right? The nsx is rear wheel drive gas engine and then electric motors in the front wheel. So it can do all kinds of funkY shit with the front wheels. The two wheels can be going completely different speeds from each other. It's comPletely independent of what's happening at the back. It's all this computer algorithms, but it's magic front end, front end that cannot happen within the constraints of like normal rotational physics. Whoa dude, you should work for an acura. I should sell cars.

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       You got my dick hard for an nsx. It's a good buy right now. People don't want them to achieve. I don't know because they're not like the old one. Like you said, you want tHe old one and people wanted to stick and simple and it's complicated and. But if people were looking for a double clutch supercar that seems to be a really good bargain. It's a great looking car. It is. I had one weekend was awesome, awesome. And apparently the, the power of seems very accessible, right? Sorry, I'm thirsty. It's, um, it's very forgiving and very easy to drive and it makes you feel like mario andretti, hope they don't not make them anymore. They've got to make them for a bit. They've committed, but I think uh, you should buy one if you think you might like on a tinge of responsibility when the viper went out of business and I never bought a viper because there's so imposturous it's such a preposterous.

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       Like I thought about getting one of those acrs with the wings vented hoods and looked down like just for just because it's such a douchebag car. Yeah. So if you were to list off like the check boxes of things that you personally enjoy, it seems like it does actually tick most of those boxes in there. Totally looking like a penis. Besides that, it really takes the rest of the box. It looks like godzilla is dick. It looks like this sort of like super autumn of it's very shredder, but it's so american too. It's such a ridiculous thing to build. Well it's american. What's so american about it is that rather than, you know, porsche developing this insane gearbox, you know, that can shift in a microsecond and, and nissan doing this crazy fucking all wheel drive system and you know, whoever accurate doing their torque vectoring, electric motors, fibers, just like more downforce, you know, we don't know manual gearbox, just.

Speaker 2:          01:04:24       Yeah, just more downforce. Develop the stickiest tire. You can find here. You can pop these things out and get even more downforce. And that's the. That's like the whole thing. Yeah. Swings just put wings on it and that'll be fine, but meanwhile they brought it to every race track and they were tracked here. Breaking records. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. It's the most american thing ever just bought a bigger gun. Exactly. The biggest 50 caliber machine gun ever. Desert eagle. It's America. It's big ole american dick. It's super America. Yeah. But then they stopped making them. I'm sad because merca isn't necessarily commercially viable. Sometimes a come on the age of trump that they can bring it back, bring it back. Vipers for everybody. Every coal miner gets a viper, a job in a viper for every coal miner. Right. It's the most preposterous car. Would you agree? Oh, well, we have Some preposterous vehicles here in America.

Speaker 2:          01:05:22       I mean, the fact that you can get a, a pickup truck version of an escalate, it's pretty funny, you know, do that still. I think they may have stopped. I think I may have stepped on my own job, but um, let's see. Preposterous. It's up there. It's pretty awesome. Yeah. The ford gt is pretty preposterous in a very, in a very good way. that's a superchArge supercar though. It's extremely super. And that's. is that. Is john [inaudible] in trouble for selling his? Don't think so. I don't think the contract is enforceable. You don't think so? I, I'm just going by what I've read on. Tell people what the story is. So to get one of the new ford gts, right? It's what's called a homologation race car. Okay. So they wanted to go when the 24 hours of lamar in a certain class that the lmg t class in order to race in that class, it has to be a street car.

Speaker 2:          01:06:15       Right. So you have to build a certain number of streetcars. you can't just build a dedicated race car that would be called the prototype class. Okay. So they had to build, I think the number is 499. It's 400 and something for 54, 99, whatever it is for decides that the demand will outstrip the supply and there rather than, you know, highest bittering or whatever they make you like apply. So you, you have to be a social media star or a celebrity or someone you had to like tell them why you should have a ford gt and what you were going to do with it and how you were going to share your four gt with the world. And then they would decide that you had earned the right to buy their $450,000 car. And it came with a contract that you couldn't sell it for two years.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       They didn't want people flipping them right, which apparently is exactly what sean's seen when it did seem to be so fucking rich. Like why would, why would he violate the contract for a couple of hundred? Huge. Really huge, very huge person or miss. HoW huge is he? Well, he's just enormous. Like with. I bet he's probably only like six, three or six. Four, six, four. He can't fit in it. So if he can't fit in it, that's probably why he would get rid of it rather than tall mr. Scene is, but when my head hit the ceiling, that's probably exactly what he's probably six to at least. He seems like a guy who should be even longer and taller than he is because he's so thick. It's almost like they chopped off a foot of his arms and every place bought a giant, but his risks are like fucking tree trunks.

Speaker 2:          01:07:59       Hilarious. Six foot 2:50. Yeah. See he probably be close. It'd be close. Six foot two or six foot. Six foot 250 pounds. Oh, he's short of thought. Well, I don't know why he sold it, but he did. Maybe even for him, if it's two inches for you, maybe felt squashed in there. Look, I drove it for one day. I don't know what it, what kind of sacrifices to buy it, but I think he fuck like me. Might be a good car for you. Good for you. So the seed is fixed and the pedals and steering wheel are adjustable. You can adjust the seat. How bizarre. Yeah. The pedals come to you. I don't think I like that. That's what you gotta do, man. It's what you have to do because the color, the shape of the car dictates the seatback angles a bit. Can you just make this seat slide?

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       Put the seat on a seat? No, you can't. The car is so low. You do see a seat. Rail is like inches. Precious. Precious inches. The roof is 43 inches from the ground. that's like this. Whoa. It's so low. It's that low. It's 43 inches from the roof to roof cleaning ground. Yeah. Compared to all the car at one law by the way in the year was supposed to. Wow. You park it next to a nine slash 11 and nine slash 11 is like six inches taller than one of these things. Well that makes a really big difference in the 24 hours of le ma, you're talking 200 mile an hour straight away. Speeds. Like that's a huge difference. So they've designed the car without seat rails to get everything even further down. You know, it's a dope looking car. I saw one that was black with red stripe.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       That was the press car was driving around, has got the same color to god. That's a pretty car. it's gangster. That's a Pretty car. Carbon fiber wheels, which are lovely. Um, carbon fiber wheels. So there's two kinds of weight in a car. There's sprung weight and unsprung weight. What's happening? So sprung weight is weight. That is most of what you think of as the car, the engine, the body. AnYthing that has sprung on the suspension, unsprung weight, his weight on the car that is not sprung on the suspension. So wheels, brake, rotors, tires, suspension components that aren't sItting on the suspension. Right? So it's like a rough calculation, but like roughly one pound of unsprung weight will translate the feeling of five pounds of tongue weight. So meaning like if you are able to pull 20 pounds of unsprung weight out of your car, each wheel is four pounds or five pounds lighter than a stock.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       We'll. Okay. So you're not about 20 pounds unsprung weight to your car. YOur car will feel like you pulled 100 pounds out of it and it will stop, start, accelerate, turn better commute. Uh, a totally in all our, it'll perform better in all areas. So to go from a forged aluminum wheel, which is 23 or 24 or 25 pounds a wheel to a carbon fiber wheel, that's like 11 pounds a wheel, you, you're pulling so much unsprung weight out of the car, it'll feel like, you know, swinging a baseball bat with a weight on it and then just throw in that weight away. Wow. Yeah. Massive, massive, massive, massive, massive difference. And the wheels are so expense, I would imagine like how many companies make carbon fiber wheel one wine called carbon revolution and they're from Australia and those are the only make them for the four days.

Speaker 2:          01:11:26       You can buy the wheels. They have fitments for a few different cars. Porsche gt three is one and they make them for ford. Will you do me a favor jamie and pull up the photo of that black ford gt with the red stripes? It's on my instagram. If you have my instagram handy, the one I drove up, I'm incredibly. The road presence is just seen and it makes noises that only god damn it makes noises that only race cars make. There's a specific sound like you know the pops and crackles you get from most of these modern cars and they dumped the fuel in the exhaust and shit and it's cool. But it's a synthetic eee sound. It's programmed right? This does that. Not programmed. It's just like fuel into header. Bang. It's just. Sorry. Scars. And this goes for like $500,000 for 50. If you can get one but you can't get what you can't get unless you know johnson and then the route.

Speaker 2:          01:12:27       I mean the rumor is he got like over a million for his butt. Oh, so somebody ordered off. Well that makes sense. Flipped it and flipped it. And so they're suing him. Yeah, I, I read that it was thrown out. They sued them for breach of contract, for selling it, but he, he claims or claimed that the contract didn't say he couldn't sell it. Oh. So it was a verbal agreement or something? I don't know. Maybe it was one of those things they just hoped nobody would call him out on and maybe it's unenforceable. You know what I mean? How, how do they sell you something and then enforced that you can't sell the thing you bought. You can't do that. You really, you literally can't do that. I don't think that's enforceable. I think once the contract is signed in and you take possession of this object, that's yours to do whatever you want, I think it's morally.

Speaker 2:          01:13:11       I compare american moTherfucker, but for fucking hats off. You made a dope ass car. That thing's amazing. It's extremely, extremely crazy. it really in it, it's, it's unlike anythinG else on the road because even even the, um, the very, very high end super cars, you know, your lamborghini aventador is that are 400 grand and you're v12 ferrari's and all that stuff are fundamentally they're road cars and even when you, they go racing with them, they sort of take the road car and modify it for racing. This is so clearly a race car that they had to build some street cars, you know, and I'm fucking rocking. It looks amazing. It's got an air brake on him. The active. So the go back to the rear picture. Yeah. So the wing, the whole wing that, that whole wing that goes across the back there lifts up when you hit the brakes.

Speaker 2:          01:14:07       Well it lifts. When you start driving quick, it lifts up and becomes a wing wing. And then when you hit the brakes it flips up and becomes a, an actual airbrake. And it is extremely effective, I would imagine. What it does is it know when you break the car, nose dives, it completely eliminates the dive. So the car just squats straight down. Wow. That's wild. It's fucking gorgeous. Are they going to keep making them? I don't. I don't think so. Why not? Ford? I fired to guest. They lose money on every single one they make. If I had to guess, kind of a bullshit word. We run in here. I know trump. I thought you were going to fix all this thought that was part of your platform. That's what I heard. It's going to make american great again. Do we? The car economy is.

Speaker 2:          01:14:55       It's such a global economy like american, like we make a bunch of the hell. Cats are built. Like in Canada. We make bmw x five in south caroLina. Well, we make up ford tundras in Texas. That's what toyota tundra. Toyota tundra. Toyota is a make a couple different cars here in America. A couple of cars in America. I think japanese automakers probably have at least as many auto workers in America as american car companies do. This is definitely the same car I was driving press cars. God, what is great is just the. The buttresses like when it goes by, you can see right through the side of the car. you can just see the air there between the tunnel and the pod. That's so pretty. Yeah. That might be the best looking car I've ever seen. It is so cool. It was so fast. As far as like american cars, that literally might be the best looking car I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          01:15:51       I think if it's my money I want. I would buy the older gt, the 2005 one because I liked the manual transmission. Sure. And I just think it was. that was just one of the best cars ever made. Do you ever drive one of those? YeAh. What's that like? The best? Really? The best, best? Best? Yeah. Because this is a race car, right? And, and everything that comes with it, that one, it was a road car and it was let's make the best road car we can make. And so it wasn't a particularly successful race car, but as a road car it was just glorious. The ride and the power and the style and the sound and you know, it's, they had to develop that car very quickly. I think the last time I was on this show we were talking about for gts and you know, so everything's overbuilt.

Speaker 2:          01:16:33       You can run like double stock horse power and you can run almost 280 miles an hour in the fucking mile and these things on stock arrow and when people do crAzy shit with them, like put twin turbos in them and stuff, I should not even that crazy. It's expensive, but it's, it's proven science at this point. They're not breaking any new ground. Yeah. Wow. It's, it's actually because they're super supercharged from the factory. Right. So they're meant to handle forced induction. So the turbo system you take off the supercharger in the turbo system, supplants it. Is that the right word? I don't know. It's just, it runs more boost, but it's a very, very strong engine. And so they're

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       not completely different systems. They just, they both force air in, just they do it in different ways. And when you buy one from the factory, how many horsepower did he come with? Five 55. Fifty is a lot back then. That's a bunch. Yeah. With no traction control. That was the last last car. The viper to the same year. Viber might've had one year, but basically the last car without traction. Control, stability control. Yeah. So a lot of people would, would crash them. Oh yeah, I would imagine. Yeah. My gt three doesn't have shit on it. It has. Yeah. It has um, control and that kind of thing. So no, it has antilock brakes. I don't think it has traction control hit really. I think the next model did because it's the rs, huh? I don't know how fortunate for you if it doesn't, it's a very raw car.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       I loved your car out of a lot of fun. Driving your car to fun cars, man. That's great. I think maybe the next. Maybe the next thing I buy my bnrs they're great. I know they're getting so expensive. I know, but safe money thousand seven. Year two is like, that's the year. The one aFterwards they became, they started having traction control. Make sure that's true. I'm pretty sure it's true. Two thousand seven gt, three rs. No traction control. I'm pretty sure there is a period of 2000 early two thousands up to an end of two thousands where portia was using the engine called the metzker engine, whIch, which traced its way back to the mall and it was a very, very strong engine. Almost say that would give me correctly. Let me se le mans le mans, the movIe with steve mcqueen. Fucking hate. That movie really stinks.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       Does it? Steve mcqueen movies stink. Wow. You are a crazy person. How dare you. I liked the image of steve mcqueen. I like what he represents. This a broody american from the 19 sixties. You know, like one of the last of the real men. Yeah, I mean I liked steve mcqueen based on the photographs of him. I've seen his movies. Like I thought it was interesting because it was like a snapshot of time. Like um, what's the other one? Oh, bullet bullet bullets. interesting. It's like you're, you're looking at a snapshot in time, you know, it's just weird. San francisco, san francisco, so empty and pull it. There was nobody alive back then. People. There was no tech companies. There's very few people. Chat. Traffic was nothing back then. Men talk to somebody about what traffic is like in 1960 and la when the guy just brought that up earlier, this show.

Speaker 1:          01:19:38       Well, I moved here in [inaudible] 94 and I remember when I moved here it was nothing like this. really nothing. It's gotten 100 percent worse. it's like just twice as many people here it is what it feels like us, it's, it's so crazy. Like you get on the highway on a saturday night just heading into la on a saturday night and you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic for no reason. No one's dead. There's no accident. It's just. I read, I'm reading a book right now called traffic. It's about the science of traffic and it. They did a study in la

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       and saturday, 2:00 PM traffic is worse than any weekday day rush hour in los. Everybody's out, everyone's out doing their shit. Dude. You know when you go to another city, like if you go to a big city like seattle and you're like, you're there with them and they complain about the traffic, go shut the fuck up. Second of all, what I'm doing must be wrong then because I'm dealing with way too many people. You guys have got it right. This is the right amount. You got a lot of people, but enough to many people, I get a medium sized city that's not la. Yeah. Yeah. And in traffic makes sense. It goes in, it goes out. Yeah. Like here, it's just like the. Hence the scooter you want to get out before it gets all blade runner. He. When's that gonna happen? Well, You know, it's like those dudes like magnus walker lived in downtown la.

Speaker 3:          01:20:55       It was dreadlocks in his garage warehouse district. Those guys like that shit. Right? He likes that. She likes being an urbanite. I'm super fucked. I'm in venice. When that tsunami comes, I'm super fall. Yeah, you're right on the edge. It's not good for me not looking good. All the cars had done will be on my room. App was the app that wants to give us access to early warning app says you have 60 seconds for your fucking day Because that I had in Hawaii. Well, yeah, there's a, there's an app now that's working in California, but it's the, you're about to die. It's, it's an earthquake's about to hit. They apparently have it depending upon the magnitude, the earthquake, which is really scary because the higher magnitude possibility the more time you have. So they really can give you up to a minute to know your foxville dude.

Speaker 3:          01:21:45       I'm just thinking what can I. I'm thinking about one in a minute. Nowhere. Nowhere worth getting. I can get to like my closet. Do you have stored food or anything? I'm embarrassed that I don't have a List of shit I need for. Probably should probably get for an earthquake, but I don't know. You must have a whole room of shit in this fuCking policy rather than here. But here I have meat in here, but I have um, I do have commercial freezers, courts for ell, for elk, right? Yeah. But um, I have, um, emergency rations, have a freeze dried food and you know, that could last me a few months. How would you, like, how would you physically get out of the city? You would really be fucked. You says you just start walking. Bicycle wheel. The real fuck would be cars. Too many cars, right? There's way too many cars for you ever see what happened when the hurricanes were hitting Texas?

Speaker 3:          01:22:39       People try to escape, or Florida, like Florida, the last one. You can't go anywhere and they just get stuck on the highway and you run out of gas and the highwAys. Nobody's scared and desperate. It's not good in hurricanes. You see comment, this earthquake get 30 seconds, you know, I think my scooter is the is what's going to save me? It's going to be. They're going to go, you're going to go somewhere. They're going to beat you. Gonna get away with a bunch of. Yeah. Yeah. They're going to hunt you down and put me on a spit. Yeah. They going to keep you alive so they could eat you longer because there's no refrigeration. Refrigeration is going to tie you up and cut off parts of you eat it in front of you. They come here and bust into this fucking place. Yeah, I mean that's the move.

Speaker 3:          01:23:19       Come here. we'll help you both. This space. Dude, who has a fLoat tank. That is so awesome. Everybody should have one. I agree. I just. My. My real concern is the, just that the mass of humans, just the sheer number is so insane and I don't think it's. I don't think it's sustainable like this number of people that are. There's never been a time ever in human history where we've had masses of people crammed into areas like we have today in our urban areas. You mean modern America? Modern Mexico city is like that jammed up. There's quite a few places that are like the population numbers higher now than it's ever been recorded. Human history and so the population in these cities is higher than it's ever been. We've never had, like matt, we never had 20 million people in a city before in America like we do in la.

Speaker 3:          01:24:11       Was that jamie stay through the smaller population than los angeles county? Is that all of them on the full 30 something states? Almost all of them is la county. Twenty dollars million people yet. It's like 16 something, right? I think of it. This is like on the 10 to 11 million units, so looking at this map and it's one tiny little area of California and it has more people in it. If it was a state than almost every fucking state except Florida that in Texas, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and given me Illinois, Illinois. God damn. That is just fucking banana leaves. So crazy. I don't. Is it where would you if you didn't live? No, if I didn't live. No. So where would you live if you didn't live here? I've probably like, I like Colorado a lot. Colorado's gets state. Mountains are good. I like noise. I like northern California but not san francisco.

Speaker 3:          01:25:05       Like farmers get fucked up. Deal with that weird dude. It keeps knocking on your door. Yeah. New woods. Um, Colorado. I think I like Utah too. I like Utah. Utah's very underrated. Those people are very nice. They think everybody thinks you tell. Go fucking mormons. I can't do it. Mormons are friendly. Some of the nicest folks ever. I spent like four months in st george was that. It's the very corner southwest corner of Utah at the Arizona Nevada corner and it's like the, the town nearest to zion national park. I was doing like landscape photography for awhiLe that, that's gorgeous science. Awesome. It's so pretty. And aCtually to bring it back to cars. um, we had a show at nbc sports called drive and did a national parks. The roads through our national parks here in America. Our glorious, glorious yellow, yosemIte zion, death valley, bryce canyon. All

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       have amazing roads going through them. Yeah. And just the view that you get. We're very lucky here. We've got a lot of cool shit. And in California we got the best roads in America. Possibly. We've got soMe pretty good ones. You know, that. Just that place where everybody goes to just to drive to fuck around that angel's crest highway. God, that's pretty. That's where I was this morning before I came here. What were you driving up there? My focus rs was having fun, we adjusted the suspension and so I needed to shake it down. Those are fast little cars very fast. I worked with mountain on mine. Um, so it's making 377 wheel horsepower and 455. We'll torque from a four cylinder and we have a adapt kw, ddc adaptive suspension, adaptive coil overs. That's hilarious. Awesome. The cars very, very fast right now. And that's a really like cartoon right now that's not so light.

Speaker 1:          01:26:58       It's small but it's all wheel drive which adds to the weight and so it's a, it's not super heavy, but it's not a, it's not a featherweight porsche or something like that. And a liTtle less maybe 33, 34, but it's a, it's got a Lot of stick and porsChe at porsche. Fuck me for the irs has this trick all wheel drive system. You can actually power oversteer. So it's not like when the front wheel slip you get power to the back. Like it has a, what they call it drift mode, which can send up to 100 percent of the power to the back. So you've been wanting you to get crazy. You can actually, yeah. Oversteer and of engineered craziness and wow. the new and the new m five, you know, is all wheel drive in the new amg. Sixty three is all wheel drive and you can electronically disconnect the all wheel.

Speaker 1:          01:27:48       Drive through a button in both of them. Yeah. So you can get drifting as well. Get drifting. Mr. Harris. Yeah. Wanting to get drifting. Whatever. yeah. What do you think of that new cadillac? What is it? The a six. Oh, was the ct six with the super cruise? That thing? It's the new big cadillac that has a giant engine in it now. Oh, it's a putting a 600 horsepower engine. What is that thing called? Ct six v c sat. What it is. I don't. I'm going to say the wrong thing. I haven't. I saw this thing. Got me excited about cadillacs. Well, there's a ctsv no, not that one. it's the ccc. I think it's called the ctcs. Ct six is their biggest one. It's the brand new. The brand new one has a crazy v engine. I don't think it has. No, no, it's not for sale yet.

Speaker 1:          01:28:36       IT has a twin turbo like dual overhead cam v eight, which is like the most advanced general motors engine ever and it's going to be a cadillac exclusive engine, which hasn't happened since. remember the north star? That was the last time kat. He got their own motors. Make it a big deal about it being cadillac exclusive for k comerica. Go fuck yourself. That's sort of what cadillac hasn't had right is right. You know the cadillac, like they actually the ctsv is the lightest, fastest car in its class that as the best steering in its class as the most horsepower in his class, so making little not sell them. What they can't sell ctsv is they can't sell ats fees. Like what do you mean no one's buying those? Well, I mean I'm sure there's a few reasons, but the, the infotainment system, that queue system is really pretty terrible.

Speaker 1:          01:29:27       Fat dick. A lot of people don't make it to the test drive because of that. Yeah. That, that thing is really like a liability is not good. It's very bad. I've tried to like I was, I rented an escalate and I was going through all that shit to try to get to the navigation. Like what the fuck man? The toughest bars forever. I'm good at this. I can't figure it out. How to get the navigation. Where do you. Where's home? Where's the fucking home button? So that that's why. Are they switching over to car play now or worse than the android or apple phone? Yeah. You can get those. Yeah. That's still. That still doesn't get you around the touch buttons and stuff and that he is the cta cta to fucking slam. I mean if that actually artist's rendering on boy, that's what. It's really good.

Speaker 1:          01:30:13       That's the ct six if it looks like that will say cadillac has a really nice history of coming out with very bold concept cars and then not building them. Oh, come on. Seriously make that. They have they build end up building water down shit for every floor. Does it to. Cadillac was always the car. Like my grandfather's day made it. You got a fucking cat. I can put that back up for a second please. That thing to me looks like a modern version of what I felt like a cadillac should be. Well that's not entirely different from a bentley flying spur. If you pull up a bentley flying spur that looks similar, but that again is a rendering. That's the best look in catalogs rendering like they. I hope they make that way because that is the best look and cadillac I've ever seen. It's aggressive, I mean aggressive for american cars.

Speaker 1:          01:31:06       Aggressive cells, right chrysler 300 saved chrysler. And when I say best looking cadillac, I mean best looking new cadillac. That's what I mean. I don't mean like the batmobile style old school catalogs because I really feel it's unfair to compare because the details, those are works of art. Yeah, I mean like what year would that be? Like a 57. Eldorado would be retail custom. Fifty seven, you know, and they're like 75 feet long. Big bodies are coming up big. So the, the slammed on bags, you know, with steel wheels. Yeah. So there's your fins. Look at that. Jesus christ as a chopped roof. Oh my god. That one. They've really gone batmobile. That looks like a bat. Yeah. God, it's beautiful though, but fit man. I wish you can't bring fins back,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       but that would be nice. Yesterday and impact and all. Yeah, that is hot. That's older. That's like a 55, maybe seven. That's a custom job. The bill. But you know, do you. Would you roll big body like that? You have full, big bought. I mean you would take it out on sunday and then you'd go fuck this car and then you would drive something that you can actually drive because part of the thrill of driving is the interaction with the road. Right. And like those cars are not interacting very well. Know there's so much weight. You're moving them around. They're sloppy. Whereas like you got into like an old 73 porsche. You could drive that thing. Yes. Even like stock from the factory. You could drive that thing. No problem. Yeah. The american car, the older american cars, like you have no idea where that limit is coming.

Speaker 2:          01:32:50       It's like I'm there, I'm there, I'm there. The wheels falling off trees. Ooh. Yeah. They're just. There was no communication, the steering wheel, old school, electric steering is like a terrible zero communication up and I used to be so afraid of old cars and then I started driving old european cars knowing, oh, this is how this is supposed to go. It's just America. Well, it's a product of their environment, right? Like in the eighties, those fucking gem guys that chomp cigars and they're off the rack shitty suits. They never left detroit and if you go to detroit it's just fucking pot holes and it's straight lines. And so of course the cars would ride like shit and, or would float around and not handle because there isn't a corner for 300 miles, you know, now you get the ctsv because these guys and they go to the nurburgring and tests.

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       It's a global world now. Yeah, it's a totally different. And then detroit, these, these closed minded morons built cars for their own city and sold them all over the world with no regard to the fact that they didn't work for shit in Italy or anywhere with corners in it. You know? That's interesting. That's a good point. And it's set up America, those you go drive a 57 cadillac in detroit and you go, well this makes all the sense in the world. The roads are straight. Nineteen 57. How's that beeline coffee? This is your coffee. Yeah, this is really good. It's good, don't you, you, you. Did you go to the place where they know it? I work with this company, beeline coffee. And at first they started sponsoring my new watch podcasts called watch and listen. Or watch. Store watch. Dark to. Yeah. The logical extension from cars to this is a delicious coffee. And so thank you. Yeah, I got you. I brought you some. It's a light roast, medium body, single origin. And that's an a lung and sohne watch. Thank you. And that's the back of a long cronograph oh, that's the back. Yeah, the back. Oh, that's beautiful. That's amazing. And that shit's all. Anything that looks like gold. That's gold. So is that um, glass or sapphire crystal. So there's a crystal and the back end. The front? Yes. Oh

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       wow. Yeah. They call that a display back. Oh. So just you could show piece. So you can admire the hardware within. It is crazy when you look at the detail involved in one of those watches, a lot of parallels with cars. So many the they've, they, they rose up in parallel. I mean the obvious connections of timing, races and stuff like that. And wearing a machine on your wrist. That's called self dealing. As I went to advertise my own watch for sale. You can do that. Yeah, we'll get that. What's that one on the far right? That's a panorai that lots called a retro, which is a also known as a split second chronograph. So it's actually two coronagraphs laid on top of each other. So it would be used to measure the time differential between say two cars on a racetrack. That's the most complicated movement.

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       Panoramics I think that was about 13 or 14 grand. That's a beautiful watch. Very nice watch. It's pretty. That was a demo. I sent it back, send it back, send it back. I sent, I said most of them I send them back as opposed to giving them 10 grand a month. Oh, is that how it works? Yeah. The part of my, I have a sponsorship deal, crown and caliber.com. What is it? What is, what is the sponsorship deal like? What does it do? Well, I started this watch podcasts, so they're our title sponsor so they gave me a budget for a year, but I can also loan out watches out of their stock if I so desire to try something. So it's like a chick trying on jewelry. Jewelry for men, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah. It's the only jewelry that you can kind of get away with.

Speaker 1:          01:36:33       Pretty much that a fat diamond ring on total asshole. No, but it makes sense if you have a watch that Jonathan Ward from icon, that was his case. He brought jonathan is really into old. Weird watching. I follow his instagram as well. He, he's into old, weird. Anything fascinates me. That guy is. He's the most interesting person that there is. He's very intense. He's like, you like you, you guys both just do so much stuff. I don't know where all the hours are in the day. Like he runs his business and he's makes videos, but I also see like every weekend and steering he'll put up like a handbag he made from scratch leather. Like where did you find the time for that? Yeah. Youtube. I don't know where you find the time to do all this shit. Illusion because um, the, the time I spent here, it's very easy.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       It's just conversation, you know, it's, it's fun. It's great having a guy like you get to talk cars. I agree. It is crying. Um, standup comedy. I've done so long. It's like a part of my life. Yeah, it's normal. The working out stuff, it's like if I don't do it, I can't do the other things. I'll go crazy. I won't be balanced and I want to stay healthy. So I do that. So it seems that you seem to churn out a large volume of content and you also travel ufc and all that kind of stuff and it's a of content. The unit

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       you, you told me the universe rewards, hustle while it does I, you know, I have that engraved on the back of the first rolex. I bought myself a really good for you matches from you. That's dope and I sort of lived on that mantra for quite a long time until I recently. I actually just totally burned myself out on it a bit. You can burn yourself out. You gotta be real, real conscious of how your body feels. Right. Well that's what I like about what you've been saying, that you're doing cardio seven days a week and that's what happened. I spent so much time working and focusing on. I was like, look, as long as I can stand and lift my arms, I'm going to keep making videos because this shit could all end tomorrow, but my body completely fell apart and so I had to go, all right, I think it's time to take care of this.

Speaker 2:          01:38:38       Well, sTick with it. Here's a car analogy here because this is your vehicle and the difference between having a 500 horsepower engine and a hundred and 25 horsepower diesel is literally how you take care of you. So and if you can turn your body into a race car, you really can't unless you know obviously have disability or something's wrong with you, but for most people the issue is just will, will in their mind and discipline and then knowledge, right standing how to do it correctly. And I've lost large amounts of weight several times in the past I lost, I've lost 50 pounds and then I lost a hundred pounds and then I lost this past two years, another 50. So like I know how to do it. What are you doing now differently? But the difference with this one is I wanted to do it every time I've done it in the past it has drastically interrupted my day to day life.

Speaker 2:          01:39:27       It's like either you go to fat camp and do it or you, whatever, you know, it takes away from something. This one, it was much more important to go, I have a job, I have a life, I have to figure out how to make this work in within that life. So it became a lot more hotel gyms really doing that. Really making sure to just do that shit. Oh, when you're on the road, the road is really hard. Yeah. It's hard with diet too. it's very hard. I don'T. I didn't change my diet that much. I just started exercising a lot. My big problem wasn't that I ate badly. It's that I would eat big meals spaced very far apart and so my body would go into like storage mode, but now I try and eat smaller meals and more of them and it seems to work much more efficiently.

Speaker 2:          01:40:13       Well, everybody's body is different, but for the most part, one of the biggest, most significant things that you can do is cut out most sugar. Cut out, most refined carbohydrates. Red is my achilles. Everybody I love bread out. Weight would fly off. You know, especially when you're telling me the volume of exercise you're doing. Oh, cut out the bread, cut out the sugar, you would lose ridiculous amounts of weight. Know Jordan Peterson was on my podcast. He was talking about autoimmune issues that he had and what he did was cut out everything except for meat and vegetables. That's it. And all his problems went away. Yeah, I know I, I've done the atkins style cave. Manny, whatever you want to call it, you know, all protein and fat,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       cut out the vegetables and cut all the car. I like, I, it works, I've done it. I've lost weight and it just, I, I couldn't stick with it because I fucking love bread so much and I just don't want to kill myself, you know what I mean? I want to. It's like it's like growing a show or something. If the curve is going in the right direction and I'm okaY pushing forward, let me just push forward. RiGht. I'll get there. I don't, you know, so. Well it seems like myself currently going in the right direction. Think about saying that you don't want to kill yourself. I get it. I love bread too and I love pasta. I'm a big fan of lasagna and I just love italian food. I really do. I love pizza. Um, but I just limit to one day a week. That's probably good.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       One day a week I allow myself to eat whatever the fuck I want and if I decide it's wednesday night, if wednesday night I go out to dinner and I said, you know what man, I want the fucking spaghetti and meat balls. Let's just do this. Then that's the night. That's the night I cheat. And then the other six nights I eat normal. Yeah, it do it. I respect your, your stick. It makes it feel better too when you get that cheat day. Yeah. Like then it really counts. And if I get spaghetti with meatballs with grated parmesan cheese over it at five, fucking digging in on that on whatever, friday night like, oh, just let yourself enjoy the glory. It's not just a regular spaghetti and meatballs because it's dinner, which is normal, you know, on wednesday, friday, whatever. Who cares? No, it's the one day window you could eat that fucking pizza.

Speaker 3:          01:42:23       The cheese. Maybe. This is what I take home from this one. Maybe I take home the cheat day philosophy from this show. She days good. The other thing is your body, if you get into that habit, your body won't be craving those things anymore because a lot of the reasons why you crave it is because your gut bacteria that's being supported by that diet and then you sort of go into gut bacteria withdrawals and that makes you want more and blah blah blah. Crazy. Yeah, but you got to do is get your a biome in check, like start eating a lot of probiotics. Yeah. Like if you can stomach kimchi. I don't knoW if you're into that. I like the taste. I mean I like korean food. I don't know how much I can eat. Kimchi is a daily thing for me. Really? Yup. Acidophilus.

Speaker 3:          01:43:02       A yogurt is good. If you could eat yogurt, you have the time to. To find these kids. Go to the supermarket, takes 10 minutes. He gets some foods. I know. it was amazing. I had to run around the city. this is why I'm surprised at how you. How well you do it because running around this city, you could have a whole day that's three activities and it takes all day to do those activities and you barely have time to eat in between the. I'm just bad at bringing that stuff with me, you know, I need to know he's better at carrying my own, whether it's bars or kimchi or whatever to bring it with me so that they don't get to that. Oh my god, I'm starving. And then murder. When you leave, get me your address and I'll have some on it. Stuff sent to you. So cool. Because we have some new onnit protein bites, coconut and cashews.

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       No guilt or like protein for each one of these little squares and they're fucking hell. Yeah. That'll just get you to the next thing. Yeah, they're heroin. I like that. Yeah. I'll have some sense. Said that in like three or 400 pounds of elk. Oh, I want to tell you I killed something when I went. I went, I went hunting. I went bird hunting. Uh, what'd you shoot? I shot a quail. Oh, I used the gun. I didn't, you know, I can't shoot a quail with a hard, um, But they were delicious and delicious food. It was really the dogs. The dogs were so impressive. The dogs were amazing, well trained, so super well trained. Went to this place in south Georgia and uh, they, they had the most brilliantly trained dogs like I've ever seen. The dis found everything. I think I got like 90 birds was a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:44:44       So you went on a full dick cheney full. Yeah. Without the humans. I didn't shoot any humans. this photo. Did you cook the quail? No, they, they sent me some which I could cook at home. Um, but they, they, they were doing them there. They were turning the quail breasts into like nuggets, nuggets, but a quail breast. And then, uh, like the drumsticks banging. Absolutely delicious. And what did they cook? The, the, when you say mcnugget, so they breaded that breaded and fried it. And it was like a whole quail breast was like a pop it in your mouth nugget. It was really good. It's a delicious meat. Yeah. Yeah. Are, they're crazy, crazy tasty birds? Yeah. But I didn't, I was like super conflicted about the hunting portion of it and I don't know why I felt I, my dad was like, that's like fishing was likely not, it's not like fishing, but I didn't feel as guilty as I thought I would.

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       You know what man, it's like, and this is a crazy thing to say, but I'm gonna say it anyway, it's, it's like an old relationship like to like, oh, like you run into an old girlfriend on the street and you haven't seen her since 1989 or somewhere to see where this is going. Okay, the fuck it is a long time ago. And you run into each other and you start talking to each other like, oh, I remember you. I broke up with something. No, not even that. Just you, you, it's a relationship with a hunting an animal.

Speaker 3:          01:46:12       People feel it very quickly with fishing because fishing carries very little guilt. Some people like, oh, is it hurt? Is it, is it going to get her? Some people get like that with fish. Most people don't give a fuck about fish. Little kids. TheY laugh. My kids laugh and it's like this flopping and die fish has a fucking hook through its head and my seven year old thinks it's awesome. Oh my god, she's so happy that this thing is dying. That's crazy. But if that was a rabbit, she had never had that reaction. Right, right. There's a natural thing that we have with, uh, with. We have a hierarchy of life. Things that closest to us we feel more connected to. We don't feel connected at all to bugs. Nobody gives a fuck about vegan slap mosquitoes all day long. Nobody gives a shit about that life.

Speaker 3:          01:46:59       But there is a life that you care about when things get warm and they get too close to us. Yeah. When they, when they get too close to malmo, like people freak out. Yeah. I went on a south african safari last year and it was like I couldn't fathom someone going and hunting a leopard or something like that. That's a weird thing. That's a big game. Shit, that's a very weird thing. It's a very different thing. It's not, it's not. It's a, it's almost like what that is and I'm not saying it's just sadism, maybe a little about what that is, is like it's an aberration off the original idea and this is the only way to look at it and people would get mad at me that are hunters because I'm a hunter and like, what are you saying? Look, it's not the thing to do, and last year doing it on just to control population, there's no reason to do it, but what?

Speaker 3:          01:47:50       What happened was in the past, the only reason people hunted was from me, right? You barely could stay alive anyway, and when you went on a hunting party, he didn't go for sport. You went to go to kill things. When you have so much food that you don't need to worry about food and you've already been shooting all these animals. Then they start doing these things called slams. They call doing super slams are the grand slam. There's a doll sheep slammed as a sheep slam, a rocky, like a big horn sheep slammed. there's like a jam burry. No, no, no. You. You try to kill one representative of each of the subspecies. My god. Really? Yeah. It's a big thing. It's a big thing with these guys. Got poker run calm, like the the big six are the big eight in africa. Africa. It's a big five.

Speaker 3:          01:48:37       Is that what it is? The big five, the five most dangerous animals to hunt on foot. It's like cheetah lion, hippo, rhino, and whatever the fuck. Leopard. Leopard. Yeah. There's a bunch of these kind of slams. They haven't for turkeys, they have a wild Turkey slam. You get the gould's Turkey, get the osceola Turkey. There's a bunch of different turkeys all over the country. One Florida. There's one in Mexico. It's different Turkey point being people start collecting. It gets. It gets weird. Well, that's the trophy, right? Yeah. It's weird. It's like it gets to this weird place like you don't think they shouldn't do it. Like, okay. Are you eating the Turkey? You are. Okay. That's cool. Are you eating the deer? Yep. Okay. Well then I have no quarrel, but when you start going like leopard lion was. I said cheetos. Elephant was the other one. Yeah. Yeah, man, I mean the only reason why you shoot an elephant is if the elephants going on a rampage through our village people and you want to protect people's lives and I'm on team people. Other than that, why the fuck else would you shoot an elephant? I have no idea.

Speaker 3:          01:49:43       I saw an elephant. The biggest elephant I've ever seen as far away from me as you were sitting right now. My god and I almost had a harder to live in africa on a safari see, but I think those things are amazing. It was amazing. It was amazing. But like you just know what you're doing. The reason I was so close is because we were watching them push trees down with their trunks, like four or five inch trees just from, oh my god. Like it's nothing. You know what I mean? Like you'd crash a car if you hit one of those, it would crash the car and like they're just phone phone and they're right next to you and if they go on your jeep, that's the end of that. You know what's complicated? Someone was trying to explain this to me and I should really be honest about this guy was trying to explain to me that when we think of africa, we think of a country, it's not a country, it's a continent and it's way bigger concepts in north America.

Speaker 3:          01:50:36       We've seen pictures of United States stuck in the middle of africa. Africa is fucking huge and he's like, unfortunately, there's places in africa where they have over populations of elephants and they encroach on human civilization and they do have to hire hunters to come in and do it and kill them or they don't hire them. The hunters pay and the money goes straight to the village. The meat goes, the village and people get very excited about people huntIng these elephants and when, when I hear that seems like a sort of short term solution to the village right there. The village doesn't give a shit about the elephants. They want their, they want to eat probably right? They agency eat their crops but becomes a big issue, you know, and they beat the fuck out of there. You know, like good luck. They only keep guiding them. Lfo now have no chance.

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       So when someone was explaining this to me, I remember we were saying this, I was like, why the fuck would you ever want to kill an elephant? We know there's not that many of them. He's like, yeah, this is why it's complicated. There's not that many of them. In some places it's like in la there's no grizzly bears. Right? But if you go to Montana, the people that live in Montana are going to start hunting these fucking things. They just declared them open for a in Wyoming. They're not. They don't have. They think they just started a hunting season and it's very controversial and they just end date. No, no, not anymore at all. Now they have a lot of them and the people that lIve up there, especially people that have been mauled or know people that have been mauled to like, hey fucking enough.

Speaker 3:          01:52:06       And now I get it. We, they made a great comeback. But you know, if you're in chicago, there's zero bears. So if, and this is a tiny place in comparison to africa. So when I was saying that like I thought that elephants were endangered, he's like, yes and no. They're are endangered in some areas and good point to fucked up point. The most dark point about all of it is that trophy hunting is the only thing that keeps those animals healthy. This is what's fucked up. I was talking about playing campaigns about this this weekend when, and this is what I say, trophy hunting. I'm even talking about normal hunting for meat, like impalas or you know elan's these, these big game animals that people hunt for because they're delicious. Even them in Zimbabwe. There's a lot of areas in Zimbabwe that are not high fence.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       They're Just open enormous areas. All the money that would come from people hunting there would sustain these local areas, sustain these lodges so it make it viable to keep these animals alive and stop poachers. A big bonds. The anti poaching, right? Exactly. The only thing that funds the anti poaching. So here's what happened. The cecil, the lion shit went down. Nobody wanted to go to africa anymore to go hunting and all of these businesses are going under, so there's nothing stopping the poachers so the poachers move in and kill everything, kill everything like that. It's gone the other way. How many elephants were killed last year by people? something like 400 or google this legally killed elephants. The number of illegally killed elephants. $30,000 come on. 30,000. Most of them are killed illegally. Most of them are poached. They have this one elephant, you know that last elephant that was dying the mail, or excuse me, rhino, rhino, white rhino or black rhino, which was in a black rhino.

Speaker 3:          01:53:59       I think they have that. That poor bastard with armed guards around it. Twenty four slash seven because they were worried someone's going to kill it and shoot it and chop the fucking horn off. Like the poaching is way scarier than the hunting and the only thing that protects the animals from poaching is hunting. It sounds so weird and so forth, but you have to look at it honestly. Yeah. They said something similar to us in South Africa, both that, that, that they need the funds because the anti poachers, you know, they, they, they're, they're all over the place. And then here's the other problem. When you say poachers, these poachers, you know what you're really saying, poor people. That's what you're really saying. They're poor, desperate people. They don't know what the fuck to do and if they could chop off a rhino's horn and make some money, they're going to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:54:44       If they can shoot that animal that's not theirs and use it for me, they're going to do it. They're starving to death. I mean they have no options. There's appears people in parts of africa that are living in grass huts. My buddy justin wren, he, he goes and makes wells for these people in the Congo and the stories he tells you would just make your eyes tear up these human beings and they're living like this 24 hours a day for their entire life. And this is, this is the norm. So we're talking about poachers will. you're talking about people that are fucking desperate. Yeah, you can call them poachers, you could dehumanize them with that term, but they're just poor people and none of them. The movie stereotype poachers somehow some of them, but most of them aren't. Now here's what's even crazier. Most of the anti poaching agents used to be poachers because there's nothing else to do. Yeah, that's not surprising. NoW they're poachers again, because they put their hunting people who they got out of jail, they got out of this position that can't be [inaudible] because they can now. They just got back from poachers again. Perfect. This happens. A lot of it's gone well,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       so when campaigns was explaining this to me and when does it explain it to me? I'm like, well, of course. So they don't even know how many animals are left in these areas where people have abandoned them. Ranches that were once thriving ways. You see. The thing is most of these animals, a good percentage of it, we're on the verge of extinction just 30 years ago because people were just over hunting them and poaching them and doing whatever they want it to him. Then they started putting value on them. People would go over there to hunt them so people would keep these huge areas in. That population boomed because they were taking care of them because they were. They were A resource and, and this is key. This is conflicting to people. It's wild. It's very wild. I just went to the galapagos on a vacation, which is interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:56:22       Have you been. It seems like you're kind of spot. I want to, can't kill anything. It's, it's very, it's like Hawaii if there were never people. Wow. So it's an. It's a completely empty Hawaii. How big is it? About the same size as Hawaii? The big island or chain of. I know it's a chain of islands. There's probably 13 or 15 islands. Whoa. Yeah. None as bIg as the big island, but most the buildings on them, there are two or three like towns wIth like 25,000 people and the rest of it is nothing. National park, 97 percent. But they talk about these giant tortoises, you know, and there were like potentially a half a million of them on the islands and it went down to like one, like they found like a fall last one and they tried to breed it. There's like three varieties of tortoises and the one of them got down to one and they tried to save it and they couldn't save it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:18       And now it's like, you know, embalmed fucking taxidermy on the galapagos islands, but you know, these giant tortoises that lived at 200 but the, um, the, all the passing ships would just like grab a few of them and they'd eat them on the ships and they'd completely decimated the entire population. They're all gone and they're trying to bring them back. I don't even know why we started here. But will they take forever to grow? Right? Yeah. They have 100 years old. They live 200 years. Yeah. And then the whole rest of the islands, what's crazy about them as nothing has been hunted there in forever. So the wild animals have no problem with people. No problem. Like your face to face with sea lions and stuff. I could be to like birds, like what kind of wild bird would let you get within a foot of it, but there's these giant blue footed boobies that have no problem with you.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       just being right here, watching them like where they can have a baby right there and they won't even fuck with you. Wow. And like huge lizards and underwater. The densIty of the underwater sea life was insane. Hammerhead sharks. I think a baby hammerhead shark is the cutest animal I've ever seen. a baby hammerhead like this. Why the why they developed their eyes out there on the end site that presumably it's like an echo location or or radar sonar type of thing. It gives you better range I think because they are in darker waters. If I had to guess, they're

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       really, really cool to see in person though. There's nothing like a hammerhead shark. Isn't the galapagos where they had that thing that they were doing with judas goats? Do you know that? Yes. That is it. The goats. Wait. Oh, captain cook dropped off a bunch of goats on those islands and they did it so that when they came back they'd have something to hunt and the goats go over. Ran the island and they. Oh yeah, that was a big problems. They're eating everything and then everything in sight. And then what did they do with the judas? The judas goes, had like a disease or something. Oh no, no, no, no, they, they took one of them and they say they neutered him and then they sent him out with a radio collar on. So he find out where all their other goats are. They would gunned them down.

Speaker 3:          01:59:24       HelIcopters and they would keep him alive. They would go, that's the judas goat. We keep him alive. So they've got all these goods down here, will move, kill all, make, makes, move rooms. And he would go and make some new friends and then they would locate that new path because otherwise it's very difficult to locate packs that goats, if you're really going to put a dent in the population, they wanted to wipe them all out. Yeah, there was they, they killed like 75,000 goats. It was a crazy number of goats, but they were completely overruNning the whole the whole thing. Well, yeah, train sharpshooters from we're sending helicopters. Scoured goats once found the goatS would be shot from the air, either in the head of the heart to ensure a quick death, whatever, using the stop lying. They never caught him in the arm. Yes shot in the face.

Speaker 3:          02:00:09       They shot him everywhere. They could there in a helicopter. You not even a steady. Go back to that place so I can keep reading. Let me you know they're not even in a steady place where they can steadily shoot. You don't have a good rest from fucking hell. They had mini guns. Gun in those fuckers down. Why lie like that in the heart or in the head to ensure clicked around using high powered weapons and military precision. Stop with your military precision who wrote this? Many people, including the plans orchestrators, had Misgivings about such a large scale slaughter of goats. Whoever the decision was made that the galapagos ecosystem under the threat and under threat found nowhere else on earth was valuable enough to justify their actions. Yeah, there are invasive species. History was written by the winners. It's just. It's funny. It's funny that they're essentially preparing for people who are animal rights activists writing this.

Speaker 3:          02:01:01       That's why they're writing, you know, they're shooting them with such precision. It's actually very funny because you know, to the galapagos is ridiculously restrictive. You cannot set foot on a beach like there without being like without a naturalist with you the whole time and you can't be more than like 50 feet from the naturalistic ever. HOw'd you guys do it? Did you hire someone to organized a thing? It was a smallish yacht with like 30 people on it. I heard they check your shoes to make seeds and you rinse off the bottom of your shoes and then they hand sanitize you when you get back on the boats. They said they've had real issues with people that have tramped on on plants and then come to the galapagos. Now those plants grow there. Yeah. Well, there's one island that has, I was expecting tropical, right, because hawaii's kind of tropical, none of them plants fucking native.

Speaker 3:          02:01:51       the ne like none of them. All the jungle plants were brought there. Like the galapagos has one island that has jungle on it and all of the rest of them are like volcanic rock and cactuses and shrubs. Yeah. NoT what I expected. And I was like, how come this island has a jungle on it? And the rest of them they said, oh, all these plants are not native. They were all brought here. And like the 17 hundreds. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So the plants that were brought there, like those plants. Whoa. Look at that shit. But I don't. I'm not sure what that is. I never saw that. But it's awesome. That looks like an artist's rendering to me. We're looking at this crazy tree that looks like it's right out of the lord of the rings. Dragon's blood tree is what it's called. That's an awesome name for that.

Speaker 3:          02:02:34       Want that shit in my yard. And we got a big building here. Can we get one of those? Need a dragon blood tree in my life. Look at that thing that looks like avatar island that floats. Remember that one that floated. But uh, it's the greatest looking tree I've ever seen. It was very cool tree. It's a weird economy, but the same naturalists that were like, you know, preserve everything are giddy when they talk about shooting goats from a helicopter. Yeah. Well they, they, they look at the goats is what they really are. They're an invasive species. I mean there life lifeforms and the, it's not their fault that they're there, but like I was trying to explain to my friend. I have a buddy of mine who's a thinking about hunting. He eats meat and he's like, if I, if I'm not going to kill my own meat, like why should I, why should I have the right to eat meats and this weird moral thing?

Speaker 3:          02:03:21       And he's like, I'm thinking about being vegan, but I know it's not the right move for my health. I'm like, we should try it. See if it's the right move for your health. It might work good for your body, but if you want to shoot something, the thing to shoot would be wild pigs because they have three, four litters a year. Each one of them, they get at four, five, even six babies and they fuck like crazy and they eat everything and then they might be four or 500 pounds. Then they can get big kill one of them, one of those a year. You're golden mean, but they get fucking. The point is they they, they get destructive and there's nothing that kills them. Where do you find these wild pigs? Everywhere. They're all over the country now. I don't hunt joe. Where's? It's not even.

Speaker 3:          02:03:58       It's not even a hunting issue. It's people live in san jose or have a problem with wild pigs going through your backyard and fucking theM up. Yeah. It's a real issue because because no one's paid attention to them. People are getting their highway, getting going to school, stopping at starbucks, doing the normal shit while this is happening. They're out there In the bush, earn it that fucking, and they're making babies and there's a shit ton of placement all over from bakersfield on up. Northern California filled with wild pigs. Are they tasting to that? Are they taste like they taste like domestic pigs currently exist in 56 of the state's 58 counties. Wow. Yeah. Where's that? What state is that? California, California. Fifty six of the state's 58 counties of wild pigs. Okay, so when you say everywhere, you're not fucking around. No, they are a biological plague.

Speaker 3:          02:04:47       They're completely invasive species and they're designed to live in places with wolves and lions and I mean that's what their origins are. What do they taste? Good. Phenomenal. Really better. Like domestic pork. Great. Yeah. Especially when you cook them, right? Like you take a ham and you like slow smoker. Yeah. Brian, it made me for a few days. First dude, I'm telling you, god damn delicious. Not surprisingly delicious plAgue. They're everywhere and they eat everything. Ground nesting birds like fucking anything on the ground. They just, they're just all the time. We're fucking up people'S lawns, digging in people. Anybody who just want to be ready, you just, someone's paid, they have habit things be locked and loaded in your yard and will in Texas they just shoot them. I mean, theY did get into helicopters. They have the helicopters. Yeah, I was, I was at a thing and a guy was telling me about shooting pigs from a helicopter.

Speaker 3:          02:05:39       There you go. A pork lIps now is what you want to look up a guy named. it's not a porno. No, no. Should it be? Probably is too. But It's a guy named pig man. Uh, who I'm buddies with this guy a text or text each other. I know him. You and peg texts me and I text him back. I was like, okay, it's crazy. He's a good dude. But anyway, he um, he's, his whole thing is eradicating these wild pigs. They did them with 10 new gen or they're shooting machine guns out of fucking helicopter and they killed 200 and something of them in one day. 30 feral hogs. And now in 37 states, look at this. While this is a point $5, billion in crop damage yearly. I mean, I liked the, I like the anti pig propaganda film. This was 6 million hogs in Texas alone.

Speaker 3:          02:06:28       Do you know how crazy that is? And again, delicious. they've got a bunch of brucellosis and a bunch of different terrible diseases. So fuck ted nugent. Well, how dare you, ted. Ted nugent sucks. Well he's definitely got issues. Yes. So they're up there with machine guns gunning down these wild pigs out of helicopters and parties. Like They shouldn't be able to do this, but party is like they have to do this because if they don't do this then these things keep breeding and there's more of a. They don't eradicate the numbers. What's to stop these things from just spreading across the entire country and becoming a real problem? well, there already are a real problem. So what do you do? Which part of you goes that looks kind of fun. It looks the were very fun. If it wasn't a life form, it looks. Yeah, I would.

Speaker 3:          02:07:21       I would want to do that with like targets. Like do they, can they do that and put one nba tarGets out there? Fun. You'd you'd want to do it with, but the thing is like you see a mama and her babies and I mean it's the whole thing is it's kind of fucked up because there's not a whole lot of other ways to do this. Here's the thing, it's like you got to locate them on these enormous ranches, so what are you going to do? You're going to have people go out there with a, you know, hunting camps and slowly make their way through the bushes or in that they would might kill 250 of them in a month or these guys get $250 an argument. The efficiency of this process. This is extremely efficient. It is an epidemic. Don't mean What they're saying is accurate. You seeiNg all these pigs, I mean look at the populations that these guys are gunning down and this is just a fraction of what exists is the shot right there.

Speaker 3:          02:08:14       That was like right out of the godfather, the pig hanging from a helicopter. The helicopter. Look at that. Oh me, that freeze frame on ted nugent's face was an extra creepy coming. Wait on a real show. Oh yeah, yeah. this was a goof. I know. Real real. Oh my God. Poor calypso pork lips. His episodes on pigmenTs show by so. But you see as a peRson who loves animals and he also eats meat. I understand conflict. You know I love animals. I love wild animals. I love pets. I love them, but I also eat meat and they do too. There's a weird relationship going on with people and animals, but that to me in modern world is one of the weirder aspects. Flying around a helicopter gunning down feral pigs that destroy cop crops caused billions of dollars in damage and are spreading across the entire country.

Speaker 3:          02:09:11       What else do you do know? It just seems so unfair, tara. One hundred percent unfair, but the question is, is it unfair if you're jogging through the woods and a bear, he you. is that unfair? that seems unfair to probably also unfair. I mean, you barely levels of unfair, barely able to just sustain a nice pace and go jogging. If yOu've got to rustle up there, just trying to drop a few lbs. Sit man, I didn't want to get eaten this grizzly. Fucking nowhere. I don't know man. We got to. We have weirD relationships with animals. You know, I know you eat meat. I do. Obviously I don't feel too guilty about it either. I don't eat meat from the grocery store and I don't feel too guilty about it. I'm sorry to say. Well I'm. Yeah, that's fuckIng life. What do you, do you feel bad about factory farming?

Speaker 3:          02:09:56       I try to buy good quality meat from good quality places and. But that's the, that's about, I don't know. I like farm raised fish and you know, I don't know. Try and buy good shit if I can. I prefer to eat high quality things, you know, but I don't know. She talked about cars more. Yep. Do we want to. Do you want to end? Yeah. What else is, what else are you seeing? And if we just had. We just got. We stumbled into a, an area of dead animals and this is your show. So that's what, that's what's going to happen. I didn't mean to bring it there, but this, this is when I get to talk to you. So what are you going to do a. So it happens.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       Um, I'll tell you what I'm interested in, man. I'm interested in that new corvette. Zr one going to drive it next week on monday and tuesday at road atlanta. That thing looks ridiculous. Seven hundred and 50 horsepower. See, that's what I'm talking about. When are they going to stop? I think thousand horsepower and a in a regular car that people can buy in China. Yes. Yeah. You know what, we'll probably do it first actually. Um, in terms of like a quote, regular car with a thousand horsepower would probably be electric, like an electric car because it's so easy to make that power, to look at that. It's aggressive. Holy shit. That's aggressive. And you see they had to put this monster, a power bulge in the hood there. Center. Um, so, you know, this corvette zero six was out before and it was very fast, 650 horsepower, but it had this issue where it was heat soaking a wherein like it was you lose power because the supercharger would develop so much heat, um, and it was a small supercharger to fit under the low hood because every, the low hood is sort of a thing for corvette and the way to make more power while also creating less heat is to use a bigger supercharger and spin it slower as opposed to a smaller one that spun faster.

Speaker 2:          02:11:50       So they had to put a bigger one, which also, which raises the hood. So you fuck with, you don't know yet a even drIven, it was going to say your, your vantage point, your viewpoint. I don't know, I, I, I'll report back you put that couple of weeks, but I think it's definitely a big, a big old cow hood. I have driven, um, there's a company called callaway. You've heard of them? Yes. They modify the wing back to that image that you just had. The uh, the aero package is certainly aggressive. Look at that thing. Yeah, it's a beast. Yeah. That looks so good. So I've. I have driven, have a corvette of this generation that has an engine like this and I can see that drove something called the callaway arrow wagon. They actually turned a corvette into like a shooting brake, like a wagon.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       Oh god. It's not that bad. It's pretty cool. But it had 775 horsepower and it was one of the scariest cars I've ever driven that side profile, that look, you can get it as a convertible. Wow. That's amazing. Zero one is a convertible. They do anything to extra. Stiffen it up. They actually, the reason they do this is they say that the roof itself is not a contributor towards the chassis rigidity, so they can sell the car as a coupe or convertible without any loss of rigidity. That's what they say thing drives like. Honestly, I think you're a douche if you buy a car one convertible. Wow. How dare you. Because you're just thinking about binding by the coop and take the roof off. You can buy the coop and take the hard roof rafters. That's not the same. It's not the same. It is because you don't like a douche. Convertibles for douchebags, the fa, the top performing corvette engine track package

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       with an aero kit in a convertible. Go back to that picture of the red convertible again, jamie, the people who suck. How dare you. Who you son of a bItch. what are you doing with the top down and outgoing, amazing wing look and like a planning. Can you break down what's your verdict? Convertible, convertible, tsl. Music and letting people know. in this instance were you driving with was with you. You just by yourself. Just you and me. By yourself. It's not to the no convertible. If you're a girl. Oh, okay. For us to know convertible. Yeah. We look desperate out there by herself in a convertible and the convertible is weird. That's a good point. A guy and a girl. That's a very good point. So in the convertible is still weird. It's still weird for you in 2018. Well not there, but any convertible to guys in any convertible. It's weird. So what do you losers doing?

Speaker 1:          02:14:29       Real men don't put the top down by yourself. Yes. You can tell somebody. I'm just driving around. You know, you can tell someone's a real bad driver. That's a really surefire way to tell someone's a terrible driver. If they've got a convertible and it's like a and they put the windows down, but the front windows go down in a little back. Windows stay up lIke a three series bmw where they don't notice those little rear windows are just still up by themselves. That's how you can tell someone's a bad driver. Never checks their blind spots. Well, even when you drive it in a convertible with the windows up like stop for is even worse. Two guys in the back too. Oh, that's in venice. I see that. I see all the convertible mustangs loaded up. When I see that, I always look at those four guys and like one of those guys dead weight guaranteed.

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       One of those guys that paIn in the ass. Three of them hating the other. Yeah. One of those guys always short on how much he puts in for the tab. It's funny, one of those guys, and you never pay every two weeks when I'm doing better. I'll pay man. Fuck you. That looks so good though. Pull that picture up again. It's really good. That looks amazing. Red with black that, that [inaudible] convertible debt. It's fucking amazing dude. And it's apparently faster around Virginia international raceway than the ford gt, which we just looked at and the ford gt is like a race car, race car. this thing as like a big trunk and you know, it's a, for all intents and purposes, it's pretty normal car. That's awesome. I like how it's not, you know, it's not, there's not a lot of sacrifice going on with driving one of those, you know, you, you get in it, you drive it and it's got a big trunk and freezing them comfortable and easy to live with. But It's interesting that this is like this game of like, okay, let's look at watches. There's no real improvement in performance. Right? I mean they're beautiful and. But I mean the performance difference between now and 10 years ago is not clear. Yeah. And a mechanical watch to know. I mean it's such, there's artistry and there's technological complication. I mean it's,

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       there's complication for the sake of complications. So they'll have watches like to use the car example, imagine a car. Okay. And from the outside it looks roughly like a normal car, right? For four wheels, don't the driver's seat, right? It has one engine and it has for transmissions coming off of that engine, all of which come back together to make it the car. One wheel drive, [inaudible] right. Imagine that applied to a watch. So it'll be like one main movement that goes out into four gear trains and then comes back into just an hour and a minute hand. well why would you sync up for gear trains when you could do the same thing with one? And it's like, well, because we can, it would be like building a car with two engines. Like that's not smart, but you do it. Just be like god built the fucking car with two engine less.

Speaker 2:          02:17:28       You're talking about like the nsx engine, we have the front engine electric. Exactly, exactly. But I think what I'm getting at is that with computers and with cars, those are the one thing that you expect and improvement every year. Yeah, just that nobody's going to accept the old way. You can't just build unless your singer and you make something custom. Well that's that the singer is what that example was, what the mechanical watch kind of industry is, you know, they, they position it as a luxury item from a time gone by sort of thing, you know. Whereas actually if you want to talk about innovation, this right here is a grand seiko which has a movement called a spring drive movement in it. And it is one of the most advanced and unique mechanical movements available in a watch today. So this is a seiko. It's a grand seiko, which is.

Speaker 2:          02:18:20       So the difference is, uh, it's like, think about a lexis. Think about alexis. A seiko is a lexus, not a toyota. This is a lexus. Lfa. A grand seiko is built in a different factory from the regular seikos. It's built by hand, completely by hand, all hand finished, hand polished. It's built of exotic materials. It has a cool movement. Do you should sell watches, watch podcasts, watching, listening. It's on youtube, but yeah, I mean I have what is called the display back on this. You can see the movement in the back and how high the level of finishes and you've got sapphire and titanium and um, so the spring drive movement is without getting crazy, crazy nerdy about it. Is, is actually a true innovation in mechanical watchmaking. So run the chronograph is on the front. The top button not here to watch the sweep of the coronagraph hand.

Speaker 2:          02:19:19       The big secondhand. you get a perfectly smooth sweep. The smoothest possible sweep that there be. It is smooth. It is, it is, it is. How much is the website? This worth around? 10,000. Amazing. Yeah. God. But it's just watch $300. Well that's no g shocks are the shit dude. 300 bucks. G shocks are awesome as far as that of a light. No, but it hasn't been, but it's polished so that it can see in the dark. The date. Motherfucker. Look dude, geez. Shocks are dope. A g shock is a watch guys. Tool watch, like highly functional, durable. I'm a g shock is a total watch. Guys watch. You can get gi shocks that are like $5,000. You know what? Yeah, they have dude. Jamie, look up a $5,000 here. Hold that up. That's shawn martin. Wards own design. It's cool. I thiNk it's based on the duesberg.

Speaker 2:          02:20:17       Yeah. Duesenberg gauge cLuster. The watch is called the doozy and it's got a complication on it called a jump. Our complicaTion, so the. It's a basically just the black face almost looks like a bathroom scale and it's got two windows. Ours on top minutes on the bottom and the minutes sweep by slowly. Whereas the hours do not sweet by slowly at 59 and 59 seconds. The hours click over write fast. So it's a jump power as opposed to a slow moving our. Now he designed the look or did he design the internals? He designed the look, the face, the complications and he worked with a swiss watchmaker to design an actual unique movement to use for this watch. He designed the case and that's crazy. It is awesome. And that watch is 12 grand and he's making 50 of them. I believe it. Yeah. He tried to use the face in that vantaa black shit.

Speaker 2:          02:21:15       What does that. Vanna black is the darkest. The blackest black that has ever existed. Oh, I saw they painted a building with. It looks like it looks like a negative space. Dude. Get a picture of vanna black. It doesn't look real and it's the most black that, that, that. That's something painted in atlanta. Black so black that it absorbs all light and you can't even wait to see anything. Can you paint a car in that you could accept in the environmentally? It's not. It's not a good thing. Hey, fuck the penguins or whoever's gonna die apparently to makes black g wagon, bro. Fuck bro. I need my g wagon ventilation in the event of black friend. The black has the vantage has vantaa black in. Of course it does. You'll see it's $95,000. And the vantaa black is just the black background. When you said $95,000.

Speaker 2:          02:22:07       My balls made my balls go like this. They went, bro. They got watches that are a million dollars. What does a million dollars? You can buy a million dollar watches right now. 300 bucks. G shock do it. There's a watch called the jacob a stratta mia. That is like wearing like a sapphire fishbowl on your fucking hand. I swear. it's the craziest shit you've ever seen. So rIdiculous. It's like liberace. The oil sheet. That jamie top right picture there. See this as a gold case? That's a sapphire case. The whole thing. So what if you bump into something and shattered her hand? That's so stupid. You are in a glass, not glass. it's sapphire cinderella mother. The whole case is milled from a block of sapphire case can go fuck itself. Seriously. It's a million dollars. You deserve. You deserve that thing to break. That's crazy looking. It's hilarious, right? That's a million dollar watch.

Speaker 2:          02:23:06       Yeah, earth is the earth. The or the planets are spinning around, spinning around and you can find a video of it thing. It's nuts. Look at the stars. Oh, it's kinda like a role of you drove your rolls royce. It would match our wash. You'd be like, what? What? You could coordinate this guy with your starfield ceiling to dan is a small earth that's crazy and it literally has the continents and silver and then some blue star thing. What Is the water made out of? You think scott would be like, I'm gonna die of something. But then there's a diamond, a son on the other side of my god, there's a ball diamond ball that spins. Some of them have different, different, uh, stuff on them too. That's just $1. You have to be to be sporting a million dollar water. That one's got out and checked.

Speaker 2:          02:23:53       The town's got a central. Let me check the time on my million dollar mother fucking watch. It's crazy, right? That's crazy. Yeah. There's some rich people doing some really, really weird rich people things right now. That seems preposterous. That thing with all the diamonds on the baguette diamonds, that's like some steam, punk, futuristic, but like, it's, it's weird. It's even more so than you know, cars. It's like because a car, it's like, okay, you got a thousand dollar car, kept $10,000, car $100,000 car, but when you zoom in really close, that's the computer version because that's not, oh, it's cgi, but that is pretty much what you get to see the astrological signs there. Oh my god. What is that red made out of that amber or something? Oh, probably ruby. The sons of ruby. It's probably ruby. The sun's probably a yellow diamond motherfucker. That is incredible. I don't get it, but I get it.

Speaker 2:          02:24:50       I mean, you must be able to appreciate that someone is making a machine that fits in a little fish bowl on your wrist. Look at that dragon and look. I mean look on top of the crazy artistry of this and the ridiculous price and the jewels and all that stuff. The mathematics of that machine work that is not. That's not just like that for nothing. that does like moon phase. You know the what sign astrological sign is. There is an actual function. look at that one with the dragon in it. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Don't say something that come out of a little kid's gumball machine. So crazy. Right? Go scroll up. That's amazing. Look and scroll up. The other images though that they had those three watches together. Do you ever look how good those things look? I mean that is. That is a crazy thing to have on your arm.

Speaker 2:          02:25:37       It's so crazy, right? That that's a million dollars and if you see someone wearing one in person, it's big. It's, it's like, it's like the size of that back. Any lid, a coffee mug and your hands. It's so big. They're actually. I mean you'd be shocked at what people are doing with certain with machinery and wanton mechanical watchmaker would be received. It's like the fight against friction is the whole thing, right? you've got this tiny little spring and you need to get as much power out of it as possible. So they engineered these like micro grams of friction out of this stuff. So they. They are work star trek and a whoa, that's pretty. Yeah, I think that is the lid liquids closed. It looks like a star trek communicator now. How much does something like that go for? Probably 50 or 60. Oh, sorry, I was going to get higher.

Speaker 2:          02:26:34       I was going to get 75. I think you can get different versions of it that are. Don't hold me to the price. It's expensive, but whAt do you think it cost jamie tayga? Yeah, that's what I was saying. 70th five. That's top. The top article should have it. The hoa dinky article usually has a price. If you scroll dowN to the bottom of that article, it should have it. That's it. Closed right there. So you can read the time when it's closed on that watch. It's eight. A 27? Yeah. And what does it look like when it's closed? Go, go up. That's close. That's closed. Yeah. And then that's another version of different tops. The clear top or the the or the metallic one and then there's a carbon back and that's a pretty watch. Yeah, it's pretty looking. If you scroll all the way down, it should say the price. No, 68,000. There you go. Fucking expensive. It's. There's some wild stuff. There's a company called h y t that is, that makes watches that have a liquid that moves around and it tells you the time based on like almost like a thermometer. The liquid goes up to this level. There's a watched by a company called devin, d e v o n that's a belt driven watch where you have like a series of conveyor belts on your wrist. Yeah, there's the h yet. So the green, the green liquid goes around the dial.

Speaker 2:          02:27:55       It's like a nuclear ooze that like flows through the dial. Yeah, it, it changes depending upon the time. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So that, that goo, like it flows. Go back to the one with the green goop on the top left there. So fills up around the dial. And then is when it goes all the way around. Is it a minute? Ain't no, it's an hour. It's awesome. Right? That's amazing. Look down and that's how you know where it is in the outline and then it had, it had a typical hour hand. yeah. And then this one, it flows around the skull to food. You actually have something like that cost 100 grand or something. Actual rose is actually sponsored by them. Believe it or not. It works, right? It's on brand for him. I think this is about a hundred grand. So when you say sponsored, like what do they do to get axle to where you just were?

Speaker 2:          02:28:44       Yeah, he wears one. Yeah. I follow these dumb watch spotter instagram accounts and they sell for upwards of 50,000. So I think, I think it's more than that. $50. Seventy five. They're expensive, man. It's David Cross selling watches. Two hundred and $85,000 to eight slash three particular ultra light. High end model. Which one's that one? But it's, there's, you know, there's some materials in this stuff. They use crazy forged carbon. There was um, 95 grand used for a skull one. Yep. Ooh, let me see that. that's pretty. Yeah, they're real crazy. I mean it's, you can Get lost in this stuff. I mean the, the machinery of it and the materials. do you think the liquid is that goes around that fuck? I don't know. They may have a different picture with a different liquid, so that's how the minutes go. Yeah, and then there was an hour is so crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:29:35       Press that. Let's see if this works. Here's the liquors. The liquid going. So cool. That is fucking dope. I love the fact that people are so creative. They can figure out how to do things like this on something like a watch. So you look at the blue, the red googling around the skull. Isn't that awesome? Oh my god. I'm in love with it. It's so cool. it's amazing. I'm in love with this and then look at it goes back, but it goes back quick. It goes back quick and resets. Oh yeah. Fill up when it goes back. Oh you got to be kidding. Oh my god. There's some really next level, like there's bellows and pumps and it's like pumping liquid around dude. Right? I had no idea. Yeah, I had no idea people were doing this to other people are doing crazy things that is fucking like on a more.

Speaker 2:          02:30:32       So that's really crazy. He'S like, so I have a watch that is called the perpetual calendar. Which is like a traditional complicated watch, so it does day of the week, date of the month, month of the year, four digit year, moon phase, power reserve. Okay. And the time obviously. And it has all of those functions and you, if you keep the watch running, you know it's a mechanical, you gotta keep it wound up. if you keep it wound and running, it will be accurate for all of those things without needing any adjustment for about 300 years. Like leap years. How many days are in the month that you're in? Like all of that shit. Yeah. I iwc propecia, big pilot, perpetual calendar.

Speaker 2:          02:31:18       I'd like a watch that looks like that. Like a classic looking either the big pilot perpetual calendar. I liked their watches. Iwc, they make beautiful watches that are like that right there. To me that's like a perfect look and walk. I like normal location. Big pilot. Uh yeah, like one. Is it orange? Hands down. That's it. But go down one on the left, bottom left or yeah, that's the one. Wow. So it does. It's got a lot going on. That's the one I have that's a beautiful wife and it's big. It's big and chunky and heavy, but you see it scott, four digit year and then the month at the, at the 6:00 Mark Day of the week and the second hand at 9:00 and then the date and the power reserve at the 3:00 and if you keep that running that'll give you june, third, 2018 friday, you know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:32:14       Automatically it knows all the math. Hundreds of years. Wow. Crazy. Right. All you have to do is keep it running, just keep it running so you have to just put it in a perpetual watch machine where it or where it. Fortunately I like wearing it and it has an eight day power reserve, so if I wear it one day out of every eight days, it's great. Oh, so it has a battery assist? No, no. The sprinG. We'll keep going for eighT days. Yeah, yeah. Eight days. And then you see in the the inneR gauge at the 3:00 position it says days seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. This one's dead. It's an emptY gauge, but normally it stays up by the des in days when it's full and it shows you how much is left. This one, this watch has a. Has a fuel gauge as well.

Speaker 2:          02:32:57       This is mechanical. Yes. He looked right down here at the 7:00 position. That watch has a fuel gauge as well. Very helpful. It's crazy. My favorite feature and mechanical watches. The fuel gauge, is that an actual fuel icon? It looks like. Kind of. Yeah, it does. Kinda look like. wow. Wow. That's dope. So watches. I have a podcast about all this called watch and listen with. I do it with a watchmaker who like to take shit apart. Cameron weiss, he's the man. Watches are connected to like extreme materialism and a lot of people's eyes like they don't. Totally. Yeah. It's one of those thinGs like, oh god, you're in The watches. Like he must be a do. Totally. It's a faiR argument because watches are so are used as trophies and flashy shit and. But they're also cool. They're all so cool. Yeah. it's like that is true. I feel with cars. I mean, look, if you is every person who buys a ferrari, la ferrari, is every one of those people a whole a douche? No, some are and some are represented. The ultimate enthusiasts. Seventy five might be fifth now it might be 50. It could be know there's, there's enthusiastic and there's dishes in everything, in everything. And the thing is those, there's a reason why those things are highly coveted because they're fucking amazing. Yeah. You know that watch, I don't want a million dollar watch, but that watches the shit. I

Speaker 3:          02:34:17       would never wear it if I had to do it. If you're in beverly hills, go in the store. The jacobs store in beverly hills frisked through the fucking tsa thing on here, right? Yeah. I'm sure they must be really worried about people walking into that store and you got to get buzzed in and do you really fuck you dude. You could smash and grab like $6,000,000 in appraising. Somebody just did that recently in england. they smashed and grabbed a watch store with machetes. Yeah, because you know there's this thiNg in england going on right now. I don't know if you know it, but they have london haS for the first time ever passed the United States, uh, passed a New York city rather for the most murders. Really? Yeah. Ever since he was a stabbing each other and stabbing each other. So the london mayor, mayor of london on twitter wrote a tweet that has been getting him tortured online saying there is no reason to have a knife.

Speaker 3:          02:35:15       If I saw that knife, you will be pr. We catch you, you, you regular guy. Regular guy. I open packages. I carry a knife. I want to cut a piece of rope. I have a knife on me. He said, okay. Not anymore. No. In london, this guy saying if you have a knife and you're caught with one, you'll be prosecuted to the fullest eXtent of the law. And of course United States were going crazY over here. Like, oh. So I thought it was a gun problem. That was a fucking gun problem. You got a band? Nice. What's next? Fucking scissors you can do. What are you going? Where's this going to end? Yeah, I do have to think that. I think we have a little bit of a gun problem. We definitely have an issue problem. We definitely have something going on, but this smash and grab these motherfuckers use machetes.

Speaker 3:          02:35:55       That's gangster gangster knew nobody had a gun. He tried to use a machete and dudes behind the counter of shotguns. Real problem. It was a homemade machete, a homemade machete. Well, how do they know It's homemade? Because they caught the guy that says I'll made caught up in my house right here. Good for good for you. I guess he didn't get away. No good attempt. Yeah. But it's again, watches, like when you think about something small like jewelry and watches, something that's this little on something you fit in your hand can be worth a million dollars. It's only things in life where something that fits in your hand is worth a million dollars. Yeah. And there's also a lot of the mainstream brands like rolex and whatever, there's a lot of um, a false prop up of the value. They intentionally, you know, they don't build as many submariners as they could because they want to drive the market up demand up and it keeps the used values high and there's this, there's an entire ecosystem, you know, based on new and used watch values and yeah, well I think the craziest value thing in anything of like high end things that people love is diamonds because they're not even really that rare anymore.

Speaker 3:          02:37:09       It didn't. I just read you can make them in the microwave now. It's not a thing. I'm like, I read an article, they figured out how to make diamonds and I'm like, how do they do that? The same way they can make them in a lap. Someone figured out a process carbon and keep, you know, when they make them in a lab, it's really interesting. I don't think they can make really big ones in a lab yet. I think they're gonna only make like one or two carrots. I might be wrong. I would definitely be down with getting cremated and being turned into a diamond. Here it goes. Scientists figured out a way to make diamonds and a microphone and it could change the diamond industry. Oh shit. It's over bitches. April ninth just happened. oh yeah. I read this article and I just noticed now it's business insider.

Speaker 3:          02:37:46       I don't trust them. Look at this. Yeah. Placing a tiny fragment of a diamond, a carbon seat in the microwave with varying amounts of carbon heavy gas. The result is a synthetic ethical diamond with the exact same structure and chemical compositions. That diamond that came from the ground works so weLl. Experts reportedly need machines to tell the lab grown gems apart from the natural ones estimated by 2026. The number of lab made diamonds will skyrocket to 20 million carats. So then here's the thinG, anyone who owns a naTuRal diamond, that diamond is now in the toilet or you think so will be like, this is natural. The shit came from. What if they can't tell the difference though? You go to a machine like this, motherfucker's got a machine who's got a machine would want to know. They would want to know. I need to know is it machine certified that it came out of the ground?

Speaker 3:          02:38:33       I don't know. Is this blood diamonds? I only want blood diamonds. I got engaged a few months ago and I should. Thank you and I got a great deal from somebody who I nicknamed. Blood diamond is not a blood diamond, I assure you, but I just love calling him blood and he gets very upset. Can you just fucking stop it? I don't want to wear this thing around blood diamond. Yeah. Well that's the thing too. It's like they've got that business on lock down. Do you want to prove your love and your commitment to the relationship? Well, you need to buy one of these. You can't buy out a fucking a car. Nope. You can't buy her an engagement car. I tried to do that. Actually. I was going to propose with an engagement jeep wagon here. That's a good move. It was until they get mad at you and you're the one that they want the diamond show their friends.

Speaker 3:          02:39:20       Matt stepped up asap. That clarity. It's amazing. He's tapped that. Did mike step up? Mike didn't step up. Matt stepped up, mike did step up. Mike's like, fuck dude. Fucking dorm. Dual thieves throw. No thought, really worked up, bro. Just need a cz. If a girl found out that you had a fake diamond, that was the thing that happened to an aunt of mine. she found out she found her. Diane was fake. She was getting divorced and she went to bring her ring in. She found out it was fake. Don trump gave someone fake diamond cufflinks. Who was that? Somebody. Someone in business. He gave him a pair of diamond cufflinks and he went and looked and they were fucking ccs. If that's the case, if he did that to you, that guy's ready to fuck you. He's. He's about to go down. Mueller, mueller, steam, and right now fucking fake diamonds.

Speaker 3:          02:40:16       You don't respect me, mr. To trump. Well, I don't respect you. Jump is fake. Diamond cufflinks for years. Oh my god. He's hilarious. He's hilarious. Do they shrink his hands for those pictures on purpose? Because his hands aren't little. Everybody was caused his hands. Little. There's something he does with his hands that make them look a little. It's like he does a lot of stuff like this is like he brings a little in proportion to his head, which is gigantic and getting bigger. Apparently poor. He's, he's going down now. When they raided his, uh, his attorney's offices, here's the thing that to, in order to get all that stuff pass through, republicans have to agree to that. Yeah. Like there'S like in order to like actual republicans and people that should be. His supporters had to be a part of that. Everyone that's signed, it was an appointee of his administration.

Speaker 3:          02:41:06       He's in trouble. If they're rating your lawyers office, you are so fucked. And if it all goes down that he winds up getting in trouble. Not even for Russia, but for paying off a chick that he had sex with. Imagine it's a porn chick that takes this whole thing down. Listen man, I need. Oh justin martindale and apology. He was saying that she's the monica lewinsky for, for this administration. Oh, come on. No way. He's going to brush this off. It's going to be nothing. Nobody cares because everybody knows, they know we did it, so it's not. It's not even a question of whether he did it right, but it's a matter of whether or not it's legal. The camp. Yeah. It's a campaign finance violation lawyer. So yeah, that that's a campaign finance pen. Then admitting to knowing about the payout is like obstruct admitting to obstruction.

Speaker 3:          02:41:48       It's like a whole other. When he talked about it in that interview, when someone caught him getting onto his plane and he acknowledged the lawsuits. Whoops. Just he fucks up, man. He doesn't know how to shut the fuck up. Not only that, his whole life has been about not shutting the fuck up about saying whatever you want. like that's his instincts and all of a sudden you put them in this position yet. What's that? I want you to be a totally different thing. Now I want you to be presidential. Yeah. You've always trying to pick fights with joe biden on twitter. You're not going to change a 70 year old billionaire. You're not going to change that guy. He's been told yes a thousand times a day floods. Forty years. Do you think's gonna happen with them? oh, do you think they're going to kick them out?

Speaker 3:          02:42:31       Like what do you think? Yeah, I don't. I think it's not going to. I think it's, I just don't see how he can make it through for years. I don't know. It's only thing one year. Yeah, it's very bad. it's very bad. While we've been going on, Paul Ryan has announced that he's going to not seek reelection. Oh, thank god. Paul. Ryan's probably sees the writing on the wall. Yeah. What does that guy do? And apparently he had some kind of realistic challenger, a democrat that has been really ramping up their campaign and he does not want to stick around to see how that's going to go. Really does want to lose. he doesn't want to get humiliated, you know? Wow. That's what it is. You think? Or maybe he's just tired of losing it. No way. Maybe needs to get paid for all those fucking bribes.

Speaker 3:          02:43:14       Like now it's time saw today that uh, the former speaker, john banner is now on the board of a major, major marijuana legalization. Shit. Got to get that paper. How do you feel about this legalization situation? I haTe it. I hate it. They should lock people up, lock them up. They're gettiNg high lock them up, but compared to prop 2:15 compared to jet Seventeen to 18, what do you think about it? Well, the 30 percent sales taX, which was inevitable, but this is what I like about that. It's still reasonable. You can get high on a very small amount of money for a long period of time. I don't think we should be complaining about that too. I think we could show that there's a real benefit to legalization that benefits communities, benefit schools, firemen, police officers, whoever can get that money. I think that's where the money should be allocated and I think you could get billions of dollars for the state just doing that and I think that is a real positive aspect of legalization.

Speaker 3:          02:44:09       That might be the one thing that's going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back across the country. When people realize that you can make real money and that real money could be beneficial to things that communities need. Plus you starve out illegal drug selling illegal drugs. Sellings with the real problem has always been when you make something illegal, only criminals are going to sell it. Then you have criminal mentality. You have people that have guns and gangs and those are the people that were scared of not businesses. Yeah. If we were scared of businesses, we'd be trying to close liquor stores. Nobody gives a shit about wineries. You know we're not. Those are drugstores. Have a winery, is a drug dealer. Are they liStened to you talking about about wine? You just sell delicious trucks and for I'm 100 percent. I love wine.

Speaker 3:          02:44:48       That's not my point. My point is selling. One thing should be legal. Things should be legal and when marijuana is legal, tax the fucking shit out of it and give that money back to the community and everybody benefits. People like you and I who were responsible grown adults, prepare taxes and are good people and we'd like to get high occasionally that we should be able to buy it with no worry about being locked in a fucking cage and that money should go to schools. That money should go to fix the streets. That money should go to cops and firemen. That's what it should go do it that makes that we know where it's being allocated. yeah. I have no idea. No idea. I would hope it's. here it goes. I'm joining the board of anchorage holdings holdings acreage. Sorry, because my thinking on cannabis has evolved.

Speaker 3:          02:45:28       That's my man got high. I was anti and then I got some of his good shit right here. I'm convinced dea scheduling the drug is needed so that we could do research, help our veterans and reverse the opiod epidemic ravaging our communities. Yes, I agree man. I would add to that. Get high. I'd say so we can get hot. Put everyone out of jail. Is there. Is there evidence showing a weed reduces opioid use? It is, right? Um, well it really depends upon how it's used. It can benefit some people with some kind of paint. I don'T think it's realistic to say that some people that are in horrible, horrible pain would get the same reaction for marijuana to get for opiates. People with really bad burns, for instance, were there 24 slash seven addicted, not for medical reasons. I'm talking about if you're become addicted to, oh, you know, oxies, there's better drugs, there's better drugs that get you off.

Speaker 3:          02:46:25       Um, there's quite a few that can help you. Probably the most powerful in the most efficient is a ibogaine because no one like, but no, no, no. I began as non iowasca I was, it is a hallucinogenic that is from south America is dimethyltryptamine. Ibogaine is from the boga tree and it's a from breaking open the head that there's a book called breaking. I'm sure he did, but ibogaine is like a roof and it's something I haven't experienced. I'm just talking out of what I've read. Essentially a ruthlessly introspective 24 hour trip that rewires the way your brain views addiction and has a high level of effectiveness. Interesting in rehabilitating people like just killing the desire to do opiates. Are they doing that in America? Mexico, go to Mexico. Can't go to America. It's illegal in America. Of course. Is it like a sweat lodge sherman type thing or is it a hospital?

Speaker 3:          02:47:22       Subsequent hospital type situations. There's a. My buddy ed clay runs a a, I think he still does, runs a clinic down in Mexico and he started it because of his experiences with pills. He got hurt, got on paIn pills and had a real hard time with them. Went to get on ibogaine to get off the pain pills. It worked like a charm and he was like, holy shit, I need to let people know about this. You can get your life back and it's not something you get addicted to. It's apparently something that hard time doing it again. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's rough. Yeah. It's like you go, okay. That was enough. Like dmt. Exactly. It's one of those ones was enough. He did it once in college and that was sufficient. You, you can get a lot out of one. Yeah. I went. I had a plaid plaid fucking world flying around.

Speaker 3:          02:48:05       It was. It was full out of body nuts. Oh yeah. It's pretty nuts. Yeah. I think the difference in ibogaine versus dmt, dmt is ego dissolving and very hallucinogenic and you see these amazing visualizations. I began, seems to not have that, but instead be like deeply like to the cellular level, introspective and just an end. there's some sort of a physical action that happens in the way your brain, the way your brain looks at addiction changes pretty radically through it or it just happens. You should probably. I think all of those things should be done in places where people are going to feel safe and where people have done it before and where people have experience with people that have done it before and having a real center that has, you know, real professionals and medical health staff, that's, that's what you want and the only thing that's keeping that from happening in America and keeping millions and millions of people from getting off pills, companies, drug companies, drug companies, lobbying to keep all these very helpful things illegal and we're slowly but surely going to work them out and the way we're going to work the mouse through money.

Speaker 3:          02:49:16       That's why I like the fact that marijuana has a 30 percent tax. Make it 50. I don't give a fuck. What's a joint? How much does it joining? A joint can get you high all day. think about what a drink is. Drink. You go to bar, you get a drink. How much does a drink cost? $8. $8 worth of weed will fuck you up. many days. Men, I don't know, about many days, two days, maybe one day. How much does the job you? Half a day. If you're buying a $12. Twenty five bucks. This is 25 bucks. This fat cigar. This is odd father. That will put you on pluto. You'll be over there with david bowie. It was $25 last month and now it's $33 a shot of macallan. Those well over 25 probably at any bar. That's it is. He's right. All right, fine. Fine. My taxes on my weed or good fine.

Speaker 3:          02:50:06       thank you. I 10 years I've been buying legal weed and all of a sudden I want to buy illegal weed because the taxes and you just talked me guilted me even back into legal weed. I'm happy to pay it and I think that it's. I, you know, I, I understand you. I get it, I get it, but what I'm saying money. No you're not, but some people would. But I'm saying the money if it goes to a good cause, if we really can change the way people perceive drugs because it's not. There's not a war on drugs. That is a lie. There's drugs everywhere they're prescribed. You can get them into the drug store, you can get them at a liquor store, you can get drugs. There's a lot of drugs. It's just certain drugs, the ones that they can't, you know, corporatize as easily.

Speaker 3:          02:50:46       So the way to get it in is not through the corporations influence, but through the influences, the consumer of the consumer to consumer paying exorbitant amount of taxes on these things willingly is going to change the opinion. You know, I like weed. Being legal. I'll pay the fucking tax. I will. There we go. I was just curious. I mean, I look selfishly, totally selfishly my own benefit. I as a guy who jumped through the hoops and got a $40 medical card, was happy to have it be called medicine and get it and have it legally and not pay taxes on it. Now it seems like it's the same except I'm paying the tax on it. It is the same, but it's progress because the money's going into community. I hope. I hope if it is, let's find out where it goes. Let's say a guest.

Speaker 3:          02:51:34       I hope it goes towards law enforcement. I hope it's divvied up between law enforcement and education. How about that? Let's hope it goes to education, but something tells me it's not. I just feel like it's going to be so much money. Like Colorado had a gift tax money back to us. Oh, do they really have to get a refund back because there's so much money being made by wheat. That's like Alaska. It's like the oil pipeline. Exactly. You haven't vegetative state taxes, boss. I don't know if they have negative state taxes, but I know they gave people refunds. The gave people money because they made so

Speaker 1:          02:52:05       much money on taxes. That's awesome. Fucking amazing. That's awesome. And if that happens in California, keep my fucking 30 percent sales tax. Real estate went up 14 percent since marijuana was legalized. Instead of going down, a lot of people thought, well they'll no to move out. There's pothead. It's going to be on the streets. Nope. a friend of mine wants to open a like a cannabis club and there's only. There's a small area in the green zone where you can do that. And I'm like, great. Here's your map of the green zone. I go, okay. What's for sale in the green zone? Nothing. Not a single building. A place where you can get high, like publicly. Yeah. It would be like a cigar bar. Yes. Um, the, there's a lot of rules a lot and there's a very restrictive of Where you can put it anD you absolutely under no circumstances can have a drop of alcohol anywhere on the premises.

Speaker 1:          02:52:56       Interesting. So if somebody comes in with a beer, you're fucked. You can't take you gotta kick them out. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but if they're in west hollywood, you, there will be places where you can go and smoke on premises. Yeah. That's going to be weird, huh? Yeah. Go get high with a bunch of strangers. It makes sense in amsterdam because it's a walking city. Then you can use your coffee shop tour, you know, to walk around the city And ground coffee, shop to coffee shop and sight. See. And it's really nice. Sober up. But in la, what are your driving from coffee shop to fucking come on. Nobody walks here. What are you goIng to do? A drive car, it's going to be like that. See what the railroad of good fellows with the helicopters flying overhead and he's freaking out. I remade that scene frame for frame and it got kicked off youtube because you have to use the real music and I got trademark infringement but I did it frame for frame with the helicopters. You mean you did it? I remade that helicopter chase you with me and it into for a car review. I was reviewing the cadillac and I did the fucking thing right through the bag in and when I'm looking helicopters and we did the. What was the problem? You um, what does that music? Yeah, the actual music. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to use the actual music. Otherwise it's not rolling stones. What is it?

Speaker 1:          02:54:09       It's not layla. Layla. No fucking hell. That's whatever it is. You have to use the exact music and it didn't work. And then that got kicked off of youtube too bad. Spends a lot of time in that. Well, they're really good at spotting copyright music now or anything copy written. I thought I could get away, get around it. If I didn't monetize the video but it didn't, you know, when we get fucked, whenever we put up a video of any nature thing, like oh a bear killing something or something like that. All those were all bought by someone almost like patent trolls. People put them up, they just take it down and you have to offer him money to like stock footage companies or something. Yeah, yeah. All that stuff gets yanked dowN off of facebook. Yeah. Youtube and facebook. ThoSe are the two places that stuff gets facebook. Like I don't put videos on facebook anymore because it just gets stolen immediately. And also their revenue is. What do you mean by get. It's

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       very easy for someone to rip your video off of, you know, put it somewhere else on facebook and whatever versus if they re upload it somewhere else on youtube, the software algorithm will generally catch it. Oh, I know. So the software algorithm and facebook is not as effective and they don't really give a shit. They don't care. Yeah. They're too busy selling your information. So look in Russia. Totally. Jamie was watching the video of dr. Soccer berg. How did it go? He should know the answer. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:55:32       he had to go again today. Uh, I was watching right before you got here in this. I don't know where she was from, but she was saying like, you're the ceo of this company and you should know some of these answers. And she was like, listing all the shitty. Didn't know it was like, this is ridiculous. And then I afterwards, now they've shown, which I guess it's part of now, public information has notes. Oh no, that he had like as references that he was looking at. I've only seen one picture of it. Just very weird stuff that like, seems blatantly obvious that he should know or should say that's different from what we've. Maybe we think we should think they should be able to.

Speaker 3:          02:56:04       I get the impression that this company grew so fast, they don't even know what the fuck is going on in now. Will those. The other thing he was talking about, their influence on possible. Are we going to continue? We'll continue. Don't worry about it. He was talking about his influence on all these different upcoming elections that were coming up and about how they wanted to make sure that there was no bots that were influencing these elections and then I stopped and thought about it and I'm like, oh my god. In that moment of him saying that, I realized like what pressure he must be under, what pressure that company is under there. They went from being a thing where people could share pictures like of, hey, this is us on our summer vacation and like, hey, you know, fucking we're going to go to the pub on friday. That's what facebook kind of was, right? People would talk about certain things in the news. They would have opinions. You put up something, a bunch of people comment on it. That's what it was. Now with this last election and with him testifying in front of congress, what I'm seeing is facebook being like one of the most important sources of influence in the world today and it's not really being completely managed out.

Speaker 4:          02:57:15       I still feel like the russians, the russians. Yeah. Maybe there's a little bit like google needs to be looked into going on with my mic. So google also probably like they have a data, I think someone was just looking into this, you know, people downloaded their facebook profile and they're like, my files one gigabyte. Well, how much data is in here? People found out a way to download theirs and find their information. And what, what does facebook know about me? Apparently there's also one that google has on everyone and it's much larger

Speaker 3:          02:57:41       to the music. I'm not shocked, you know, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be nervous if it wasn't for that. That memo thing, um, really changed my mind about a lot of things. Not because, you know, it's a subject that's near and dear to my heart, but because the way they were handling it was not, there were, weren't being honest. They were, they weren't being honest about the science. They weren't being honest about the reaction. They weren't even the way they were describing it. We're talking about the james damore google memo. Oh, I don't know. Oh, it was at the seXism thing was that was the the what he was talking about women in tech explain why women would prefer to not like why some women are not influenced by the way google handled it was very, very nervous because they weren't being honest about the information.

Speaker 3:          02:58:36       They weren't beIng honest about the results that weren't being honest about what was in his. They were saying he was reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes. That's not what he was doing. What he was talking about, the science of the difference in the psychology between men and women and why women would gravitate towards different careers and maybe that's why more women aren't in tech. Maybe there's ways to get women in tech will. You've taken that angle before, right? with women and fighting and women in sports, right? Yeah. There's some women that are not going to want to be into those things. There's something going on that are going to be wherever they are in comParison to men. It's less likely that a woman's going to be into fighting than a man. I don't think that's extraordinary to say, but a lot of women are into it. It doesn't mean that it's impossible, but it's just we're looking at human beings like if you're an outlier and you're a woman who really loves to fight, there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 3:          02:59:21       I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I'm saying it's much more rare that a woman who wants to, you know, do become a nurse or do something that's traditionally a female, a care giver, sort of a position which is really common. And I read it. Did the letter memo indicate like this that science says women were less predisposed to becoming programmers or something like that? No, no. It just was talking about gender. I'm like, choices and choices people make and why they make them based on personality traits and how, why things are more common. Certain things are more common in males. Certain things are more common in women and that this would indicate why there were less women that were involved in tech and it wasn't some systemic sort of, um, discrimination campaign put on by men, you know. But my point was, we're talking about them having all the information that you have, like google and facebook, how much inflammation they hit on you.

Speaker 3:          03:00:15       It would make me less nervous if I didn't know about that, how they handle that google memo thing because I'm like, well you guys aren't being honest about what this is what the guy wrote. You're paying the guy out to be a villain and you think if you fire him and drown this, that this story goes out. And then you guys get to look like social justice warriors and then you don't take the heat from the what, you know it was an objective analysis of this issue. WeLl, I don't. I'm not sure. Mark zuckerberg has a lot of incentive to be totally honest in this chase. Either he's totally honest and he's malicious or he's totally honest and he's almost comically ignorant about certain things. Yeah. What he's saying, he's. I think he's almost got to say he doesn't know, but the problem is that they improve. He knows. He should know though is I feel like also

Speaker 1:          03:00:59       part of the thing he should know now, him saying he doesn't know what if they can pull up an email, wouldn't mean what if they have access to all of his emails and it shows that he knows.

Speaker 4:          03:01:09       They did. I was talking to yesterday about it and we were like worried about the facebook recording thing. Is anybody gonna bring that up and it was brought up and he said that they don't record audio.

Speaker 1:          03:01:18       Facebook doesn't. Right. You were talking about it with google weren't. You were talking about it with google that if you talk, if you were talking in a room about a certain subject, have you ever had that happen? Right. That's the apple home pod. You've. You've had, you've been talking about something in a room and then had pop up ads pop up, right? No, I have it. No, no, no. I believe it though. It happens. You had it. It happened to me before. Not. I don't know how. I couldn't tell you what were the signals went, but I've definitely had strain. It could be a coincidence, but I've had strange ads pop up that are.

Speaker 4:          03:01:50       I read that, that I don't know if it's accurate though. When I was reading that there people have tried to prove and it could be people on facebook side just to give them propaganda that that's almost nearly impossible to do right now just because of the technology would take to record your audio, have it scanned by something and then deliver an ad to you based off of that. And amanda.

Speaker 1:          03:02:08       Yeah, it's entirely possible. I could have looked at something similar at a recent time when it was just far enough away for me to not make an exact connection. I don't want to quit. It represents those that you recognize that that is potentially in the future. Like for things like alexa and things like home pod and the devices that are designed to listen to your voice or that's the whole point of them. You know, all this good. I don't know dude. I get a lot of. I get a lot of shit done. I'm real productive. You know I can, I can. I have things that are, would Be very difficult to find that can be delivered, bro. I had, I have a, I have a, I have a 2001 mercedes sl 500. So my traffic car. Ah, perfect for traffic and nice big clarion system is great.

Speaker 1:          03:03:00       I love my traffic car and you know, it's got the old school, removable hard top. So I needed to get the stand to put the hard top on when it took it off. Right. Amazon 12 hours. I had a stand for a 2011 mercy delivered to my house. Wow. That level of convenience. Yeah. I'll give up a little privacy little bit. Little bit. Fine. I'll give, I'll give it up. You can have it. That's what's gonna get us. That's what's going to get us to turn us into machines. Just give up a little bit here a little bit here. I don't want to give up all of it. Like I'm definitely opposed to the drive vehicle tracking, you know, like, like, uh, about having a car that, that knows where you've been and tell somebody about it. Um, which a certain company does do that, what will companies this will tesla's know where you been well done, don't they all by virtue of their gps, but tesla's are wirelessly connected to tesla. So the reason. So part of the reason tesla

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       semi autonomous system works as well as it does and part of the reason tesla is doing what they're doing as a company is your car's all tesla's on the road are collecting mapping data for tesla, you know, in real time. So they can, you know, be ethical with that data or they cannot. And odds are they don't give a shit where you're going other than to help them figure out where to put the next superchargers and and whatnot. And in general you have to assume that to improve your experience. But if you extrapolate this 50 years down the road and some of our privacy's get worn away, you could end up with a car that were, you know, where it's very easy to subpoena the records of your tesla and find out exactly where you went. So a test that would be the worst car if you were like a bank robber.

Speaker 2:          03:04:42       Fuck ya know, if you need a hundred miles analog, analog, big fuel tank. Think transporter one. Jason statham. That's what you want. big fuel cell. Black. Late model car. What's that in invisible black again. Vanna black. Phantom. Black car? No, no one right now. We haven't painted anything like big in it yet. It's not yet motherfuck I have venta car on the way. There's some weird environmental shit with vanna black because John John Ward was telling me that there is one note that is velvet. My frIend velvet. That's fucking velvet. You? Yep. That's real. Yup. Oh wait a minute. That's not. That says vanna black, but that's not vantive black. That is a velvet car. That. Wait a minute, this, this rolls royce is not to, but it's not vanna black. Zippo. Impossible. It says it is there. I'm telling you, they haven't painted a car in vantaa black. So either that's fake or it's the velvet shit they're doing now.

Speaker 2:          03:05:44       That's a computer. Yeah. Would what it would look like. now what is it made out of that allows it to get to this level of darkness? You know? I don't know. It is just damn crazy. Looks dope job. Please don't put your make up. We can't be frIends anymore. You can do that. I saw justin bieber wants driving around in a, a leopard print audi. Oh, he's got to do what? He's got to do. Fewer. Twenty three years old and drownIng and pussy. You'd probably do. This is think this was years ago. It was probably 19. He's probably trying to keep them away from him. It was probably one of the grossest the car possible. Just to say, look, stay away from my dick to cover. Who of your crazy guest has rolled up to your studio and the dopest car. Do you. Does anything come to mind?

Speaker 2:          03:06:32       To bill's area and roll up and that six by six. Got you. I wasn't cool is so gross. That's disgusting. I didn't even really believe me because I knew we had a uh, a, a chrome fisker, fisker karma wasn't. Um. Yeah. And they just released that thing I heard they did though. Company bought all the assets and they've started blowing up and trying to get water when the ones that I asked for one for review, they say hold. Lightly declined. Yeah. I wonder why. Yeah, yeah. You got a big mouth going to drive through a puddle ones.

Speaker 2:          03:07:13       Yeah. Electric cars, man. There's a bright future. It's just a. I don't want to jump in yet and I don't want anything driving for me. True. Have you, have you driven electric carver? Yeah, I've driven a tesla. They're nice. They're nice. Yeah. It's weird. It feels weird. It does, but in an urban environment, you can see why it's a nice experience. When I drive An electric car, there's the fisker. When I drive an electric car and I get where I'm going, I am noticeably more relaxed than when I'm driving a gas car, especially if I'm driving like allowed sportscar. Right, right, right. Yeah. The goal, those vibrations and stuff go through your body and kind of like stick with you versus the serenity of that silence. Just the 250 mile range. It annoys the shit out of me. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's. They need infrastructure like they're considering how many teslas are in los angeles.

Speaker 2:          03:08:01       There's an embarrassingly small number of superchargers in the city. There's not a lot of places to charge the tesla outside of your home and they really need to do the infrastructure and they need to come up with a faster charging solution. Which porsche it seems may have done. Porsche has a new electric car coming out called the mission e, which is a tesla fighting thing and they supposedly have a fast charging system that can do like an 80 percent charge in 10 minutes or something. Yeah. Well, so you know, that's crazy. Ten minutes is pretty close. Ten minutes is fast. If you get three right, you have three to five. 10 is fine. 10 works. Ten's good. And a competitor is good because you know tesla's, you can't charge them for free anymore. You don't know the model. Three's and the new ones, they don't come with free charging and he's motherfuckers.

Speaker 2:          03:08:56       That's how they get you. $5 rocks first one's free. Yup. Yup. No more free juice. Wow. How long was it free for a few years. At 2013 the model s came out and four years or so. So what happens when you pull into the airport and you go to one of them electric spots per credit card or you have a rfid fob or something? Fuck these motherfuckers gotta pay to play my friend. Why can't they figure out how with all the sun in la to have a solar powered car? Uh, you just, it's just not possible with photovoltaic cells to generate enough much. Dude. it takes so much juice to move a 4,000 pound car down the road. So much more than turning on a light or playing a radio. Like that mass movement. It takes so much energy. Fisker had something on the roof that powers the radio, right?

Speaker 2:          03:09:51       Yeah. I know there are a couple of company. FiSker was one. Someone else did a photo voltaic roof where it, it likes circulates the climate, the air when it's really hot out or it can pre turn on certain things and shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. But it's not enough to run or charge a car. What if that's gonna change in the future? I'm sure they don't have solar panels really. Have they come that far yet? We'll test a solar as a roof tile. I've seen this. Yeah. Yeah. Tesla roof tile. Yeah. They're trying to do a tesla solar tile that goes on your roof that then will feed into the tesla battery pack that hangs on your wall. You know, and then you can be a autonomous basIcally sorta. But you're still in the grid. Yes. And you give money back to the, the, the reason why they do that they want, they don't want you being completely off the grid.

Speaker 2:          03:10:42       They don't want the grid that died. You know, people are really worried about that. Well I'm building a building right now, so get this la, you know I'm a democrat, but la will make you want to hang yourself building shit. So I have to prep my building for solar panels, whether I put them on or not. If I put them on their $92,000 to cover the roof and solar panels and I will pay. They pay themselves off in seven years. So I generate swelled thousand dollars or so, a year in power and then after that I'm fully, fully positive and the city will pay me every year and they pay themselves off in seven years and the life span of them is 20 years. So I could potentially have many years of free power. Wow. Yeah. So you're, you're building. I'm building a collector car storage facility. Here's where I plug it.

Speaker 2:          03:11:37       It's called west side collector car storage. It's going to be in playa vista, California, which is the sweet new part of la. Beautiful area. Yeah. Do you know where the clippers practice facility is? You seeing that? It's right next to the fox hills mall, right by lax, venice. It's conveniently located. Um, and I'm going to have storage for 150 cars. It's going to be secure climate control, the whole, the whole deal. So this is, you're doing it as an investment or as a, as a business. He has a business ground up. It's great for customers is not, you know, it's not for me and we're building a cool studio there like this, like you've got. instead of my shanti little studio, now I'm going to do a podcast and the podcast studio is going to be elevated, so we have car stackers, so I've 24 high stackers and the studio is elevated.

Speaker 2:          03:12:22       And when just look out over the stacked cars. yeah, that's going to be killer, but I have to comply with a lot of California environmental craziness. I have to put a fire hydrant in this like for the city, like I have to do it for the city to get a building permit. Well it kind of makes sense if you're fucking cars catch on fire. You got a lot of gasoline in that one spot. Yeah. Yeah. The fire system that we have to build is incredible, I would imagine. Yeah. And we have to have auxiliary pumps. It flows 3,500 gallons a minute in every car. So the stacks, every car on a stack has two nozzles at it front and back, while every car has its own set of nozzles. Wow. So if a fire starts over here, it's completely contained over here and I. The idea that they kick on automatically when.

Speaker 2:          03:13:12       Oh wow. That's incredible. That's a really neat, but I'm four years into this now, so broken ground yet hopefully next week. Wow. Permits just got. Just got approved. Wow, that's dope. Dude. Come back on when it's done. Oh, that'd be great. CoMe back on wednesday. So people. No, thank you. Um, we've been doing this for like three hours And a half. Is there anything else that. is there any other shit going on? No, I'm just happy to see you. I'm happy to see you. I'm sorry I didn't get to come to your new year's show because they've made it a tradition two years in a row all over this place. I know. I liked your new special to the one that where it was crop tight. Yeah. I liked, I liked that very much. Doing that with my next went to. I'm trying to make it like you're sitting in the audience.

Speaker 2:          03:13:53       That's great idea behind it. And I liked chappelle's tiny one. He did in the belly roll. Yeah. I was at gotham comedy club when he first told that iceberg slim story when he came back from africa, I was friends with christmas lee. And he's like, come down, chappelle's back. You know chris? yeah. Back in New York. The corvette stingray like yours. Does he really? Yeah. Chris and charlotte christmas. And um, that, that special is good. And judah free landers was amazing.
