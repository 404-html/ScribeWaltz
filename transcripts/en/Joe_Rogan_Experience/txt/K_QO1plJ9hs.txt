Speaker 1:          00:00:10       The Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       the next evolution of the podcast is complete. Ladies and gentlemen. It feels like a fucking radio station now. We got real chairs instead of those goofy couches. We got rid of that shit. One of them's at our house. The other one's in Brian's place. What'd you, what'd you, by the way? Uh, he, uh, I think he wants it now. So now I'm like, Oh, I want your chair. Yeah. Why? Because he has said so. What'd you do last night? I went over to Joe's. Help them hook up the studio and he was. Oh yeah. Well I think I made to get to that. Sure. Because you can't even fit that chair anywhere in your house. I was thinking about doing something like Joe did pretty much taking out my whole and my office is just fucking scary. I can't even go in my office just too much shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       So I think I need to empty the whole thing out. Redo it and Redo it from scratch. Yeah. I still need to Redo this area back here. By the way, bitches were sponsored by the fleshlight holiday boys. A fleshlight that com, if you go to Joe Rogan.net and click the link, you will get 15 percent off so you get a discount on your masturbation and whatever the fuck it's costs what it's 50 bucks or 60 bucks or 100 bucks. It's worth it. Because think about what a hooker costs and you could shoot mad loads with this thing. I don't know though, if you've been watching cops that, some of these hookers, like $10. I mean they, they look like $10 hookers, but it's still. Think you want to get a $10 hooker ever in life. And Allison, now speaking to $10, what did he say?

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       How rude. Uh, we're, we're here with Alison was alison, I don't even know your last name. Allison. Shula. Shula, Allison. Shula. I know her as Allison Brock's from twitter, r o x. and she's Brian's friend and she's a, a young and upcoming standup comedian doing the fucking Hollywood shuffle out here, making it happen. Making it real. She's a cool chick and she rides motorcycles. She's fucking crazy. She's a [inaudible]. She's, she's been brought into this world of slapped Brian into, in place before we get started with anything entertaining. Um, uh, this weekend Ari and I are going to be at the West Palm Beach Improv. I'd see a 28th, 29th, and 30th and Brian's gonna be there too. We're going to have a big, big party. And if you don't get mad at Brian, if he's behind you making faces while you're taking pictures with me, he'd done that. He did stop doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       But really you had done it for six years. Yeah, six plus years and maybe taking a hundred and 50,000 pictures. You've really for real. Might've taken $150,000 if not more than that. Think about all the UFC is all the comedy shows for six years over and over and over again. Hundreds of people in night. Crazy buffets. If you have any of these pictures, where can people send them? We should create a gmail. Wait, we had one on my space for awhile. Until you did. You ended up deleting it? No, I can't. I try to delete it. We'll let these fucks. My plates are so tricky. Like yeah, we'll get back to you with an email. It's like a girl that you could never break up with. I'll call you back and then we'll break up the pitch. Never called you back. You guys should make a tab on your webpage.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       So just has those photos. Like a photo gallery. We. Yeah, we should totally know. They're hilarious dude. It's, you know what's not funny? Three of them. You know what's funny? 300,000 dollars. That's when it gets funny. If becomes hilarious because it was just, you just fucking committed to that shit for so long. Like I would be like, this guy's a monster. He's fucking. People give up on shit. They have a silly idea and, and they give up on it. Brian will fucking ride that boat right into the ground. It's the beach. He still in the boat. Boom. And has to hit the rocks for he stops and he, he's a, he's a determined little fella. Gets crazy ideas. And he said, well that's why videos are so good. Because if they, if he wasn't so determined, he wouldn't keep going, you know, he has like all this cool footage and he puts it together, but that's not enough.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       You know, he always has to add like a million different things and sound tweaks and very under appreciated. It's like drive both motivation. It's like really nice when you meet people like that and we're going to figure out a way to make money off your fucking video skills do because you look at other people's videos online. I look at your videos, dude, you got some fucking mad talent when it was a video. A big problem though, is that when, when I do it, I do so many layers and so many little things that no one will ever know. Notice, you know, it's just like in my head like crazy person. Like if I were to ever do that, like do notice. Yeah. There's. So there's a, there's a artistic quality to these videos. It's fun and it makes it, it's an extra layer. It's like, it's like the nuttiness and when you're sipping wine taste.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       I tasted oak, it squeezes the last brain juice out of my brain though and after I do one it is, I just want to fucking cry. You don't want to do a long time. I've been with Brian on both times of where he's kicked the power to was computer and losses project because the whole thing shuts down because my fucking office sucks because you've got numb feet, motherfucker. You're walking. Well you what? Yours is exit pretty good. But like underneath my desk it's just every single wire and the power cord like this is updated. This is updated. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to get those cord ties. We got caught, we redid the whole thing. You don't give a fuck because you're just listening, most of you. But uh, we for the longest time I just figured, well I'll make it look like a living room and we'll sit around and so I got couches but couches fucking suck.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       You know, like if you're sitting up and you're trying to talk to people like these are comfortable way better. This is way better. So we've got office chairs and we got a circular snort cocaine off this table. If you want to do that, dude, you should start bad habits. Been living my life. Good too long. Start talking. Start fucking up. You don't know about them because they kind of want to be like, yeah, you know what I think we're going to have to do. We're going to have to get those ones that you have like on the radio, like when you go to open anthony and I have like an arm to arm. Yeah, we've got to get an arm. Yeah, I have those at my house. They always break, but I think I got cheap ones so maybe they make better ones. We've just got to talk to someone when we do radio in West Palm, we'll find out where they buy their arms. Can't wait. Look it up. It's going to be fucking crazy. So please tell me what you were telling me before we started the podcast. What made you stop? Because it was so ridiculous. We had to talk about this in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       Oh, John Travolta is starring in the new God movie. He plays John Gotti ads as the lead

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       roll. Okay. Listen, this had to have been a plot by the government. If what? God is dead right. He died in prison, didn't. Yeah, I was saying they're just trying to fuck with them. They're trying to kill him while I was in jail. This is a plot dead. Is he still alive? I don't know, Dude. I remember when I was a kid and this whole John Gotti thing was going down. I guess I wasn't too kid like I was. I guess I was in my twenties when he was in his prime and it was so weird. I was like, I didn't understand it. It was like he was so mocking of the law enforcement just walking down the street with fucking, you know, $10,000 suits on and get in the limousines. And it was like, Whoa, like this guy doesn't. He's, he's ridiculous. I watched a documentary on the history channel.

Speaker 1:          00:07:25       That's not how they're supposed to do it. The whole thing about the mob was that they were all like in the, on the dl, like everybody was staying like Vincent the Chin Gigante, he's a famous monster, you know, one of the reasons why he's famous because he pretended to be. He was running everything, but he pretended to be completely insane because he knew they were after him, so he would walk around with slippers on and a bathrobe over his clothes and just walked on the street and talk to himself. And he would do it all fucking day and it kept him. He's crazy. You can't say he's not crazy. So everything he says is fucking useless. This guy's nuts. Does he or does he not walk down the street and his underwear talking to himself all day long? Everyday. Well, yes, your honor. He does, but I don't think that there's no more talking. This guy walks in, is under it. Well, we think he's faking it. How can you prove? And then everybody's faking it. They just want free food. Who doesn't want free food and a bed? There's no crazy people. They're just pretending to be crazy. So you take care of him, you know, he can't say that. You can't judge whether or not someone's crazy, but whoever fucking thought that John Travolta should be John Gotti. That motherfucker.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       That's crazy. That's funny though. It's revenge from the government. Yeah. That's hilarious. And let's see, who could we make his son? Oh, his son is being cast by a that the guy, Justin Bieber. James Franco. Which you who? Yeah. Who also has some Gaydar action going on on his side. He didn't. He play a gay guy. Harvey milk played it. Very well know. So to Shaun King, just heterosexual. Just kidding. That's the trick. Knee hating. No, it is you hate. But it is true.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       Your DNA. You from the

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       idea of kissing men, even if it's for a fucking movie, you know, it's like I got good news and bad news. Oh, okay. Hit me with the good news. Dude. You're going to be a fucking movie star. Shut up for real. Like a fucking movie. Cool. My playing with. Dude, you're playing with Sean Penn. Shut the fuck up. I'm coStar with sean penn. Dude, what's up? What's up is he gets to fuck you in this movie. What's up is you have to make out with sean penn. Could you Imagine always wanted to work with sean penn. He was a brilliant actor. Always imagined standing there with him at an award show. We're both wearing suits and shit. We thank the academy were all respeCted and loved and here this motherfucker is right there at the door right at the gate, but now he's going to make out with Sean Penn. What would you do? What would not do it? I know. No, I'm not interesteD in acting is acting. To me. It would have to be something really fun. Like I would love to play like wolverine and an x men movie, you know, if there wasn't already guy that played it like that. If they offered me something like that, I'm like, dude, I'd love to be wolverine. I'd get on roids to play wolverine. Like I need to get yoked, you know? But like

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       that would be a spad as wolverine by the way. That'd be crazy because actually need just training to do what? That Wesley snipes fight. That never happened and you became a crazy bad ass and I can even imagine like throwing wolverine into the mix. That would have been

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       so much fun. That wesley snipes thing obsessed me for two months. I'm really lucky that that didn't happen. If I went out fighting him and liking it and then keeping them in 10 years from now, I'm just fucking completely gone. I'm just forgetting where I leave my keys every five minutes. You know, you're not supposed to start fighting when you're like 43 where I was. I was 36,000, 37. Then. That's what's crazy about this hershel walker character, you know herschel walker football player, you know the story behind this swipe this, this 48 years old. Okay. Heisman trophy winner. Super athlete just as fucking prime example of like perfect athleticism. But this was a long time ago, a long, long, long time ago. And in this whole time where he hasn't been playing football, it's just been a few years. He stayed in insane shape. I mean the guy's like super fucking dedicated to training and now he's like 48 years old. Going to be 49 soon and he's fighting this weekend on strikeforce and showtime. It's become like an mma fighter. It's kind of fun,

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       but it's okay because he could still fight and all that, but he's just not going to repair as fast. If he gets injured,

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       he's an amazing shape or it just doesn't even make sense. There was no 48 year olds that were built like that when I was a kid. When you were 48, you were someone's dad and maybe had like old man strength in your arms, but you probably had a pot belly, you know, or at least a little bit of a gut and you know you're probably scary because you know you would. You would hit someone first, but no one looked like fucking herschel walker. Yeah. He doesn't look like an old man that you shouldn't fuck with

Speaker 4:          00:11:32       flex body or something ridiculous, full fucking eight pack. Just totally shredded. Not an ounce of fat on his body. And here's the crazy shit he says. He only eats soup and salad. he has one meal a day, like everything about this guy screams that he's a fucking alien or bullshit. I only eats super sad. It's all water soluble. He'd be dying. It needs meet. What iS water soluble like? Yeah, you will. You need Protein salad right through the soup. It's liquid. You know, what's he doing? That's crazy. Right? But why does he say that? Well, there. Here's the other thing, beCause he wants to. He his, his game. Your dad probably, but. Well he's obviously fucking insanely dedicated but he might be crazy like for legit, crazy, like he's like had like a bunch of mental, a bunch of mental health issues in the past.

Speaker 4:          00:12:17       The point where he has like some sort of a. He has more than one personality. Was that multiple personalities? Yeah. So maybe the part that works out is different than the part that talks. The part that talks doesn't get access to all the interstate shape. This guy's right up my alley dating period. It's a funny thing when you find yourself date and crazy person just to get some posting. Every guy has done it. Allison, I think it goes both ways. I've had my share of crazies. Is it just to have a boyfriend? Like fuck it. I just know it's like where they are cool for six months and then all of a sudden it's like what happened to you? Like they get comfortable with you and know how, like what does it freak you out? So then they Start being their weird ourselves. Then you're like, where did the cool person go that I said, well, there is some kind of game when you first start dating where you're trying to be cooler than you are with them, and then you start farting key in life is to become that Person.

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       Become that person who when you first meet somebody and you can, it's just we get lazy. You know you really are that person at your very best unless you're just a complete sociopath and you're absolutely bullshitting about it. I fucking loved dogs. MeanwHile, you're deathly allergic. You know you could be one of those meds, but if not, you know that's what everybody should aspire to, right? You should aspire to be the person that you pretend you are when you're trying to get laid. I could've took that creamer in my coffee, but I said, no, I'm allergic to. Why would you take creamer? Nobody gives a shit if he of creamer in your coffee or not. It's Actually more of a bold choice if you have no cream. whenever someone wants black coffee and which you don't even give a fuck about flavor. so crazy. I started drinking coffee black.

Speaker 4:          00:13:44       I've been trying to sneak a dairy into her diet without her knowing lately just because she's allergic to dairy. Ladies and gentleman. Yeah. Well she has this thing, you know, she's like, I, if someone ever farted around me, I would just in that relationship, I wouldn't matter who, who would be in stuff like that. So now I'm like, oh yeah, we'll see what happens if you start shitting yourself. So when you were trying to do is get her sick because she won't let you. Right. Wow. What a grown up. By the way, that kind of 36.

Speaker 4:          00:14:13       Brian's a grown ass man. I'm in over my head or trying to get you to fart. I was just acting like that crazy person. Oh, okay. No, I don't think they added that logically. You had like a ria. You're like a nice road. That was premeditated. Yeah. That ain't going to jail for a lot longer from that shit you think? Yeah. You got to walk there and pretend you're crazy. I don't even like illegal. You have to come up With some some reason for people to think you're crazy. No. My mom would ask me, allison, juvie. Gridlocks wasn't tolerant or is it all in your head? And I'm like, why the fuck would it be all in my head doing that to myself? People that believe that everything's all in your head. All allergies can be with no,

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       they can't. Stupid. right? Babies are allergic to peanuts and you give them. They die, but you're not allowed to give babies peanut butter because you have to find out if they're fucking allergic to peanuts. How do you find out? You got to find out

Speaker 5:          00:15:02       your milk. Your milk thing happened later in your life. so is there something that broke your mail, your milk? Uh, yeah. What, what was it? You just had five cheese pizzas when I was 15 years old and in the lunch line they had these like cheese and a bagels that were so good. So I got one and I ate it and I was supposed to meet this guy had a crush on afterschool and I'm walking into his house and halfway through I'm like, jesus christ, I can't walk any for. Yeah. I'm like, mom picked me up because I didn't drive yet. So he'd pick me up. I'm like, stop at mcdonald's. And she's like, what's going on? I'm like, I don't fucking know. The next day I tested it out again.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       She ran in the bathroom and the battle was over. Did you even check to see if the toilet's clean? Sort of a cleansing. It was a cleansing. Yeah. Fucking dirty thing man. When you have to take a shit in a public toilet rub and sweaty ass with some stranger in everybody's sweats on those things, man.

Speaker 5:          00:15:52       Yeah. Seat cover. the seat covers are stupid too. and then like when you're done with it and it kind of grabs onto the water and flushes down with it, you know, that little arm and shit smeared all over it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       They always look stupid. It never looks like it's supposed to be that way. It never looks neat and tidy. So you go in there and blast out of your ass. And then what? Did you not go to this guy's house? No. Wow. I never knew what could have happened. Crush like man's confidence. You could have changed his whole life. So that over. And

Speaker 5:          00:16:17       we actually wound up dating though. They're a high school. So that was the thing though. That pushed it over the edge. That was your last year, first thing, that and that ever since then, anything you were maybe, which is the. Have you tried just to eat a pizza? Yeah. Um, I could do with like lactose enzymes, which is like the supplement, like lactaid or something and pizza. But if I have it without like five minutes later. So that just gives your body. That's interesting. have you ever tried raw milk? Um, no. I've tried almond milk. And all that

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       raw milk has a that it's not pasteurized or homogenized, so it's got all the live cultures in it and it's supposed to be much easier to digest. I've had a bunch of times at whole foods, but I don't think they carry it anymore. I'm not sure if they do, but I couldn't find it the other day because a lot of people think it's creepy because it's, you know, it's just fucking run out of the cow's tit. Yeah. And it's in like five days. It's terrible. And like after the first couple of days is good, but it's kind of not healthy. That milk just sits in your fucking refrigerator for two weeks and doesn't go bad.

Speaker 5:          00:17:10       That seems like the worst milk you could ever drink though. That seems like the most hardest core milk. Every job's a tv and yeah it is. When they milked the cow though, a lot of the times they get feces on their hands when they're milking

Speaker 1:          00:17:24       a little feces. Feces in your diet keeps you strong. You need to. You need to have battles. We did the your immune system, you know, like, like when you get a flu, it's good for your immune system, your immune system fires up and the next time the food comes around, the immune system is not so fast. Bitch. That's why I never get the flu shot. Or we'd get a little poop in your body and your body and then you could fight off disease better.

Speaker 5:          00:17:46       We had this podcast last night, that naughty show, podcast number. We had this porn star

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       on it and she was talking about how she right after the shoes, I forget what it was. She was getting fucked in the ass or something like that. And then never in life should you ever be in a position where like I was getting fucked, you know, whatever, whatever her name iS, kelly divine, you should go look at her twitter. Okay. So you can get a better idea of what she looks like and no one's going to cause your twitter Page. And bree olson, olson's twitter page every day is about, oh my god, my pussy sore suck. So much cock last night. Just like everyday it's like more and more brutal. Crazy. There's so much that a guy With a two inch dick would make it feel like a fucking, a 10 inch or like she said, that felt like her tweets. What's. yeah, what's crazy is though, after he pulled out his dick out a real ass.

Speaker 4:          00:18:39       Yeah, after he pulled out his dick out of her as he puts it in her mouth and he said it was just caked with shit, just so much shit that you know. And then he fucked her in the mouth and then in between shoots she had to go to the bathroom and she said she spent for like 15 minutes picking shit out from her teeth and she didn't have any like, toothpicks or toothpaste. So she was like, hi, what do they pay you for that? Oh my. I think it Was like three we own, but from this guy's dick real. I've never seen that in a movie, but I've seen a lot of astrobiology and I'm always. I always have the same reaction. Why is that necessary? Do we really need to do this? Turn someone on? I asked them a lot of people on fucking dirty I.

Speaker 4:          00:19:22       Yeah, and I asked them and does it ever get better? does it like turn into chocolate after awhile where you're just like looking forward to some shit in your mouth, you know, and she's like, they're like, no. It never ever. Every time. How many times has she gotten shit? Her mouth. Well, I guess that's pretty common when you, you, you do a lot of asda mouth and. But she said that she was just saying this one time and take care of god. That is so crazy. They pay me all the money in the world. Part of it is that other girls are doing it. All you need is one girl to do it and it's such a weird thing. If oNe girl does porn where she left a guy pissed at her mouth and every girl is going to start letting go and pitch their mouths.

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       It's a weird thing. It's like all of a sudden that's become like, yeah, It raises the bar and that, that becomes acceptable to us now asked to mouth when I was a kid. No. Okay. When you got a ginger, lynn, peter north porno, they had sex at the most. He shot it in her mouth and it was pretty hot, but it didn't stick it in her ass and then put her mouth. But that's like standard today. Yeah, well that's not anymore. No, just under a load in an open mouth. It's like, oh, not this again. I mean literally you can go on [inaudible] dot com and look up loads in the mouth and there'll be like a fucking 100,000 videos of girls with their mouths open and guys jerking off in their mouth. She goes through this website you need to check out because every time she's on it I'm just like, wow, that's a cool video, but I have a feeling it's one of his websites that everybody goes to and I was just the last to know about it.

Speaker 4:          00:20:36       What's it called? today's big thing? Dot com. I Think I've heard of that before. It's great. What is it? It's just everyday they have this crazy new videos and stuff like that. Like they have this one and I do. They have this one video on there right now. It was doing cellos, have saw that on twitter, but I didn't click the link and you got to watch it because it's like they're trying to be really hard to see what. I'm sorry. Do you want to join cellos for the song? Um, that an internet, internet, internet net. Oh, mIchael jackson's beat it. No, no, no. It's the one that I'm the band also resaying. Yeah. Speed it. No, it's not beat it. It's not smooth. Criminal. Yeah. Yeah. So we're so wide and so, so it's um, so there's like, like playing the cello, why? They're both looking at each other and they're trying to be hardcore and stuff and then it starts going the hips thing and just being like they're fighting but they're playing cellos and are staring at it.

Speaker 4:          00:21:34       It's just, it gets really good and then it turns into them like in this weird part where they're like wrestling in his bedroom or something like that. Or in a bar. I don't even know what it is. A dark room and cellos are amazing. Yeah. The cellos are amazing things that you can sell advertising today. If you have guys kissing, do you think you could sell sell things? Yeah, you could. You could have girls kissing and you could still sell a porsche. Yeah, you know, but if you have, could you imagine, could you imagine if portion, just like the new ceo just had this wacky idea. What I think we need to do is capture the gay market. We are missing the gay market. We'll take chance to push a name is sol in the american culture. They love our cars and this guy just takes a while chance.

Speaker 4:          00:22:18       So it's just going to get that gay market to just has to guys like making out in front of a cayenne, put hands in the pockets and shit. You know what the fuck. And everybody just abandoned them to audi. Fuck you bitches. Fuck your stupid rear engine car. And they get so many complaints for like pta mothers. yeah. But why? How come if it was a girl and a girl kissing with aca compliance only from fat chicks, it'd be the only ones complaining. A few families taking their oversize hands to cover their teenage sons eyes while he's watching tv. Fuck. I would rather see two girls kissing. Then two guys kissing. Yeah, because that's the first two guys kissing to get much more Likely rape.

Speaker 4:          00:23:01       That Is weird though. That two guys to me still if they're kissing right in front of me is tolerable as I am. I'm still kind of like, eh, because tolerant as you are. If you're tolerant, that's debatable god. Except for yourself. Yeah. This is a genetic thing, right? Do you feel like it's genetic? I guess I'm not judgmental at all. I don't have any problem with anybody doing anything that doesn't hurt anybody else. If you want to be gay, be gay. It doesn't bother me at all, but it weirds me out when I'm around gay guys there making out. I've been like as close as you are to me and two guys were were holding hands and then they just moved in and started kissing each other into your bed. No to outside.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       I remember distinctly saying, okay, don't panic. You know, like my boss. I was like, don't don't get uncomfortable, just move away slowly palpitating but yelling. Whoa. They're bugging right now. Right here. It's, it's, it's so juvenile. It's like I completely support your right to do it and I think I'd look at fucking. Sometimes it's pretty gross When, when men and women are doing it in public, it was just a lot of people that get fucking sloppy makeout sessions in public and it gets pretty narrow statement. Yeah, I support that. Do that. I don't have a problem with that. I don't have a problem with anybody doing it. But you got to let gay people straight people do. Oh, absolutely. I have nothing against it. It's just, I'm just saying it's weird that like I don't, I could see my two girls kissing, you know, my mom doesn't care of two girls were kissing.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       What is your feeling when you see two guys kissing? I feel vulnerable. I feel like don't try to just me. I like, if they wouldn't have nothing to do with me, man, you know, I'm telling you at the time it doesn't matter, but it's like with a. If you know that you're for sure around a guy who's into guys and it's like all of a sudden you're in a, you're in a completely different like roll, you know, you'll, you'll like, you can be pursued now, right? You could be pursued by a dude like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Even though, you know, I, I know they don't want everything to do with me. It doesn't matter. I've seen instincts like get the fuck away.

Speaker 5:          00:24:59       Yeah. I've seen two guys kissing and I just kinda like watched because I was like, that's interesting. It just looks different, you know, like far as looking at it an alien or investigating it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       I wish I would if I could be a neuter for a day. That's how I feel. Neutering people. No, no. Like if I wasn't a man or a woman, if I could be sexless for a day, then I could probably look at it like that and like to look at it like that. Like, you know, from a scientific point of view in my boss is fascinating. Like what is that like? That's their return on like I don't understand like when girls, anytime a girl is ever been attracted to me, I've always been like really? Like, what the fuck do you like? You like guys, you know, you like, like what do you like? You know, like it's ridiculous. Like it doesn't make any sense. You know, for a man, it doesn't make any sense that women are attracted to men. I understand they do have a long lifelong history of experience of seeing it. Seeing girls be attracted to men. So I know it's real. Right? But I don't get it. But when it's a guy and a guys attracted to a guy, then it's like, whoa, this is like super alien. right?

Speaker 5:          00:25:57       We just don't know it. Something we've never lived or experienced, you know? We're never going to be able to know what that feels.

Speaker 1:          00:26:02       And that's, that's weird with like kids that's weird with like guys that are into like fucking horses and all that shit. Like how do you get the that that's even going to fucking. your brain just is broken. Some people's brains just don't work

Speaker 5:          00:26:16       work. Right? Right. They just attacked by a man with a foot fetish at laguna beach. Tell, won't tell them the cops and everything. I'm on. I'm on the internet now. Um, okay. So anyway, I'm at the, I'm at looking at beach with an ex boyfriend and we're smoking some weed on the rocks looking at the ocean. This guy walks up and he a camera in his hands and he's like, I think your style is really cool and really beautiful. Can I take your picture? I'm a photography student. I'm like, okay, sounds good. Mike, do you mind if I smoke weed? It's like, so I keep smoking. And he started taking my picture and he's being really cool and he's like, can I have you take off your shoes? And I'm like, uh, okay. I think we're at the beach. I guess this is fitting, you know, take pictures of my feet, start snapping pictures of my feet and then all of a sudden he gets down on a knee and I'm like looking at him like, what's this guy doing that?

Speaker 5:          00:26:59       And I'm like super high and all of a sudden he puts my foot on his face and goes, he licked it. Does that make you feel? I'm like, whoa. And I'm looking at my boyfriend sitting right there and I'm like, and I'm right in front of your boyfriend. Did he not know that you were with the guy? No, he's, yeah, he's a crazy guy. And then I'm like, what are you doing? And he's like, oh, I want a foot fetish website. It's California beach feet.com. And he puts me up on there. I fucking take the business card because I'm just super stoned and I'm like, what just happened? Check out the website and I'm on there. She didn't even recently just send a. Yeah. I recently emailed him and said I'm going to cease and desist. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       yeah. There's about dudes Who were into people's feet. Did you save it?

Speaker 5:          00:27:48       The pictures, the pictures and the video or the video of it that you should've saved it for. You take that down. That's great. Oh, It is 25 bucks

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       before the internet was around, you know, like back when, you know, you had like find things in magazines or you know, it's like, it was a lot different if you wanted to see some weird shit, you had a really, really go out of your way to see it. There was a, a magazine called foot. There was two. One of them was like this lady boy magazine and wish I'd Remembered it. I wish I remember the name of it, what it was a magazine completely dedicated to cross dressers and they were like fucking marines. These guys were like, the guy works at the deli. The guy was bald with a big fat head who slices salami. He wants to be a woman and he's got makeup on and a wig and he's like posing like a woman and it is fucking tweaky. It's the, you knoW, like look how lovely she looks and you know, they'll say that what the woman named for his character that he plays when he dresses up is, it's so fucking strange.

Speaker 5:          00:28:43       There's this new show coming on. Um, were cross dressers, compete Like In like some cross dressing, like reality show I saw a commercial for. Have you guys heard of it? No, I saw the billboard of it. It's like, so it's like, it's like a, it's like a game show booth with crossdressers.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       What I was going to say though is that there was one magazine called foot action and I remember looking at this going, what the fuck is this? So you got to open it up and check it out. And it's all like dudes who jerk off on feet. It's a whole thing. It's like feet on decks and girls rubbing their feet on decks and it's like, that's like a big fucking thing for dudes.

Speaker 5:          00:29:17       I don't get it. That's for standing now for kissing magazine, male whole magazine dedicated to its grass because that guy who took all those pictures on my feet, I know he went home and touched himself to him doing it right now. Yeah. What the fuck is if you have a foot fetish, if it has a little bit of cotton, do you get hornier from it? You know, like if there's little cotton Between the toes, but I would imagine it's like a little bit of a pussy, a little

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       bit of a foot fetish when I was like 18 or 19. well, not really. I just thought they were attractive. like girls who had pretty feet were attractive. It helps. Yeah. Just sister sonia feet in Massachusetts. One girls had like hubs so he goes walking around kicking ice since they were a baby or feed feeder. All jack, you know, I don't have a foot fetish, but I definitely like touching feet. Like when I sleep I like to touch a little foot. I like to hold a foot but I don't like go after a full day. No, but some dudes it becomes a giant focus. Like that's more important to them than vaginas or mouths or anything like that. Something like ms dot firing in the brain when people are fucking strange man. The way one person's brain works and other persons doesn't. I was telling you guys about this before we started the podcast and I saw this horrible video online or there's two kids are skateboarding in front of this guy's house and the guy comes out and tell them to stop skateboard and they are like, fuck, you can skateboard where we want, and they they're getting sort of sort of like a pushing, shoving, sort of a little situation and the man runs into the house and grabs a gun and guns down these two kids right in the street.

Speaker 1:          00:30:46       IT's all in the security live leak, I'm guessing. Or it was on youtube because it's not, it's not that graphic. You can see him shooting from a security camera from like the front of his house. Right? It's fucking horrible. You know, when you think that, you know, an argument between someone who wants to skateboard and some guy who doesn't want to hear noise can turn into some man gunning down someone's children. You know, they're like 15, 16 years old. They're like, kids. You know it. She was so fucked up to think that someone's brain can actually be wired that way or they just want to go out and just shoot somebody who's making too much noise and it's so crazy how random it is. Mark, mark marco that I was telling you about, he was walking in north hollywood and some guy just came up to him the other day, just put a gun to his head and said, give me your wallet and your cell phone, and it's like, what can happen?

Speaker 1:          00:31:29       It can happen easy. There was a guy out here that shot a cop podcast, last podcast. Fuck man. It's a fucking nutty world and as the economy gets shittier and shittier, people get more and more desperate and more and more things like this are gonna happen. Unfortunately, you know, there's a lack of balance, you know? I don't know how it comes back around, but it ain't going to come back around the way we're rocking it right now. There's just so many fucking criminals to get guns. Why don't you have one? I just don't know. Well, I mean it's like, all right, you want to get a gun, it's like 600 bucks. That's a pretty big purchase, you know that much. I'm guessing like decent ones and then there's probably a thing that you can kill somebody and it's only 600 bucks cheaper than that. It's probably 20 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:32:15       If you go in the right places on the streets and you get a cheap gun, but you have to do the class too or you were not collapse. You have to sign up like two weeks beforehand or they have to get background checks. Do I want to be put in the system and it's going to take you awhile to get it. You want to be put in the system to be put in the system. That protecting system. Brian is a, he's an anarchist. He stays outside of the system, hurt libertarian. He does not believe in this. Culture is right. I'm not going to Canada move to vancouver. That's why you don't vote. Right? So you don'T get put into the system. Right? I already got put into the system for the irs though, so that fucking sucks. But I don't knoW how that happened. I didn't do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:32:53       They just check you bro. He found me. They check comics all the time. Comics get busted all the time. But the irs. yeah. ExcuSe me. Yeah. Yeah. Because comics don't like the charge to a report. Money. Like they'll, they'll take gigs and they'll get paid cash. It was a huge, huge problem in boston back in the day. We all got paid cash for all these gigs. So you got to do your own taxes and most of these guys are lazy as fuck. they didn't do anything. They just took that money. And then, you know, years and years of these comedy clubs reporting that they have these employees, you know, and then these guys never. It's just really bad. So a lot of them are, you know, tens of thousands of dollars, hundreds even, you know, over years and years without paying taxes. What do you do if you can, if you can't pay that back, you gotta pay it back, pay it back slowly as quick as we can.

Speaker 1:          00:33:37       So guys, we're working like every night guys were taking all these crazy gigs. Just to try to pay off their irs. Not see. I kept withdrawals automatically once a month and then was pretty much forced. It's the mom back to john gotti. Hey. Yeah. Right. So who the fuck else was in line for it? Was it like barry manilow's busy. David cassidy can't do it to anybody. Dude, she doesn't want to act anymore. I was going to play john gotti that john travolta is not a bad ass accurate. Don't get me wrong, but that's not the right guy for the part. That's ridiculous. That's silly. I mean he's great and pulp fiction. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a john travolta hater. What? It had been weird if they use. Oh yeah, I would have been kind of cool that I would have totally. I've totally would have went for that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       Would it be a good role for stallone to have been something that he would want to like try hard at and stretching. You know, like when he did cop land, like he made some, some the camps a few times. Good actor. Yeah. He can be a great actor and rocky, but you know, why do all that hard lifting when you could just be some bad ass, some fucking wooden face wouldn't lyric movie, you know, that it just makes $100,000,000,000 in the box office, you know, he's the master of those expendable type movies. So they sit there and put some jersey shore guy in there. I'm sick of all these jersey shore, like ari was on a audition the other day, or a commercial shoot with one of the guys from jersey shore and him about like some, some kind of product. I don't know if I'm allowed to say there was a, uh, a picture of kim kardashian and, and she was holding hands like they were palling around with snooki and they're both having this incredible belly laugh. They're leaning back and they're laughing so hard at all I can think of is what are these two dumb cunt laugh? What the fuck are you laughing at? What, what, what did you w who said something funny, right? Sneaky. Sneaky. Probably forwarded them. Kim kardashians. Queef too. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:35:31       So strange. It's such a strange time we live in and. No, no, no. When I say dump concept, say with all love, I don't really think there. I mean I think they're just doing their thing, you know? I got no hate for it. I find it fascinating to watch that show. Not one episode, but I watched it twice or hurt your brand makes you grip the seat or you like what is going on. Like it makes you realize like these are real people, man. This jersey shore is. They'll fight over anything. He'll throw shit at each other. They tackle each other and pull hair and and turn it. These crazy slap fights and they know cameras are on. They know they don't give a fuck about these reality shows are, it's like a bunch of scientists putting a bunch of rats in a little glass cage and like, let's see, the males meet with all the females can fight

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       that. They're sendIng jersey shore to Italy for season four. They just announced in the whatever the eu, the italian american interest group unico or whatever it said that they're just pissed. They are so

Speaker 1:          00:36:22       great. Well, those people aren't even all snuggies on italian, right? I don't think they're all italian. She's like puerto rican or something. Don't know. I've never, I can't believe you were talking about them, but we should. it's fascinating. We should just like when you go to the zoo and there's one monkeys throwing shit at the glass, you want to, you know, it's not like this monkey's beneath me talking about him. No man, that's, you know, these are monkeys. These jersey shore people are just a different type of monkey. You can look at it like it's such a trivial thing to talk about. Discuss. But it's really like scientific work. And what's weird is most of you would thing

Speaker 2:          00:36:57       most of them remind me of myself when I was like 18. And I was like, wow, crew palm may put my bangs up. I'm going to go, you know, like I felt like I was. But now I look back. I'm like, dude, that is so embarrassing. But

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       the product, look, this guy, the situation, he was however retarded he might come off. He's obviously working very hard. He's got like videos and exercise videos and he's trying to make something happen. ProTein, vodka. I don't know. It probably is. I mean he's, he's got a bunch of shit going on. He's obviously trying to make the most of the situation, you know, when you see guys like that, you just got to think this is just someone from a different world. That's all it is. It's from a world where you grow up around people like that and that kind of behavior is acceptable. I mean, I never lived in jersey shore but I was born in newark and I lived in New Jersey and I have relatives from New Jersey and you know, and I grew up in boston and that behavior is a lot more fucking common than you think, you know, and if everybody in your house behaves like that, it's, it's like, what the fuck is that

Speaker 2:          00:37:56       on the phone?

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       If that's every day. I mean That's a real. Those are real live people out there, man. There's a bunch of people that that's their everyday yelling and screaming at each other. Come on, bro. This fucking guy does knoW who I am, bro. This guy has no am

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       glad I only had two italians growing up

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       near me or they're monkeys. That's me. So I can say it. I'm three quarter monkey. They're fucking apes there. They're squawking apes. They like to get on top of cars and jump up and down and bang on. I'm just like a chimp would all that yelling and this. It's not a coincidence that they're the loudest motherfuckers on the planet. You know what? I have a lot of family in New York. My parents are from brooklyn and all of my aunts are like the whole, oh my god. it's brutal. But it's funny, but it's like up there. Well, you know what though? It's fun though. They're festive people. You know? I'm only bullshitting that. I totally hate it because they have the best food ever. I would take italian food over everything and I am a talent three quarters of time, so I can't be that self hating, but this or that passion that makes it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       It's a crazy race. You know? There's some rakes. Like I liked the armenians. Armenians are fucking crazy, man. Have you ever, you know, I mean I know a bunch of armenians from the ultimate fighter, from, from, you know, the ufc fights from just training. A lot of, a lot of them do jujItsu and those guys are fucking down to just punch you in the face. They're wild. They're wild dudes. It's like a whole race of wild dudes, but that's just the way they are. I mean, you know, if you're born into that situation with the fuck, you know, you know how hard it must be to try to not be that if you're growing up or on your dad and you're in a tight knit family. So they're all together. They all act just like each other and it's fucking 10 of them in a house for real. I mean if you there, those are very family oriented people, armenians, they just, you know, everyone's over the house. Grandma, grandpa, the other cousins are visiting it just like they're very family. They're all like, they're all like super like intense people. Burbank is like filled to the top with armenians. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:39:48       And it's like my starbucks and stuff. They they sit out there and play poker and like you'd walk in and they all stare at you by giving you a, like, we could trade it. My friend armand arbit, the armenian,

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       my friend armand was a pool player back in my pool plan days and he was, this motherfucker would just jam. We wanted to gamble constantly. Come on, you've got no heart. Come on gamble. It's a gamble. Just always wanted to gamble. Armenians in, even in pool, they're like aggressive, right

Speaker 2:          00:40:13       in the place where I get my haircut, which is fantastIc. Sams or an $8 haircut type place and there are meetings and there are two that are all the family members of the guys that are playing poker outside and so they kind of know who you are from, you know, just go into starbucks every day. So I sit down and it's the most uncomfortable haircut cut ever. Like it fuels, like I always think that she's going to take the scissors and just stab it through my head. So that's what I'm thinking when I'm getting my haircut. I'm like, don't stab this scissors because it's very intense. You need to get a haircut with me and you want to get a scary, a very intense armenians or what have you. Right. And it's just. Which haircut is she? Gonna fucking snap. Right. That's what I'm saying. If I had those thoughts, I wouldn't even go anymore. Well, intuition was he. The thing is, is I, I go to starbucks every day mixed in with these people. Yeah. Keep your enemies close. You know, like, like if they start throwing grenades, they're gonna. Be like, hey, you better stand over here man. You know, I'd rather have that.

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       You want to be in with them. So you say hi to them when you see him. Hi guys. I did the nada. Did they open the door when they're coming in and out? I know so far as to make friends with them. No, no, no. Don't do that with anybody though. I was very, like I told you last week, I keep very hidden like a ninja low profile.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       Right? Why is that? Careers? I don't know. Easier, right? It's easier to avoid conflict. Absolutely. I think I talked to that old man building your shed in your backyard, right? Oh yeah, absolutely. We talked about his daughter's dogs. People that just want to start telling you shit about their life. Told me a lot. It's very. When you get stuck with one of those motherfuckers and you realize like it starts off as a normal conversation. Like what's going on man? Nothing. How you doing? No, everythIng's good man. How about yourself? Well, it would've been better if it wasn't for last week. No, last week my daughter married this man and I tried to tell her to stay away from this fellow, but she didn't want to listen and you're like, oh no, no, fuck yeah. So that's what I try to get out of it and stay away from is that kind of shit.

Speaker 4:          00:42:13       That shit is brutal. That shit was like a beaten woman. You're afraid of men. You become a lesbian who become a social lesbian. You know who's the best ideas getting out of this situation. So that's all you gotta do what you gotta do on. He'll make his phone ring. Yeah, he'll make his phone ring. And he's like, I even saw once when this waitress at the ice house, pasadena at his house, this waitress was talking so much. Finally he goes, please, you're giving me an ear beating. Seriously, I need to. I need to get out of here. That was like joey diaz meets ernie and bert. No. Who is that oscar the grouch? Cookie. Monster cookie. Monster. Monster ate cookie. Okay. So anyway, so joey told her that he's, he's getting it here, but you're getting the ear beat and just start going. Stop. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:42:59       She took me to say that some people you cannot, you cannot hit. She did that last thing like, oh, kind of like feeling being silenced like that. Well sort of, but maybe she's fucking crazy. Maybe that's the only way to get her away. You know, maybe she would've just sat down with us and started talking to us. So some people just don't know. Some people need those checks just because there's always going to do it unless somebody does say something, be fucking bad ass. If you could test drive people's brains, if you could be like, I wonder how dumb this motherfucker really is. Can we just climb inside your head for five minutes? Be able to read it someday? Probably, yeah. Malcovich dude. Have you seen john malcovich lately? No. Have you seen it ever being drawn on liquid? It's a great movie. It's a great move.

Speaker 4:          00:43:42       Yeah, just rewatch. imagine if you could pilot, you know, if you could like, I want to know what it feels like to be a girl. So you pilot allison? Yeah, for like just pilot around the house for like an hour and shula and she just, she just stay silent and lets you move around and look through her eyes. She knows her in there. She left In there and you can move. She goes silent. You walk around, you move her body around you finger yourself. You can do whatever you want. You have her body for one hour and then a trigger to get into sleep with a bunch of guys. I don't think I would do that. Oh definitely. Finger myself though for sure. Wouldn't you? I would do that stuff, I would pee on myself and all that crap. You realize when you, when you start using a flashlight. Yeah, sex is way better, but it's pretty fucking good. And that's why girls like girls with dildos, like I never got that. I was like, why don't you stick some

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       remembered inside yet it's not as good as a real dick, but I bet it's probably pretty fucking close. You know, girls. I would definitely, if I would, I would 10 minutes I'd finger myself. I would try to have sex with another woman while it was that really tried to make out with her. Yeah. Yeah. And what have you turned midnight and turn into a pumpkin. Like point. It was like 1158, you know, it'd be great right now if I was a guy and are a girl, but I'm not attracted to guys ever since my uncle touched me. I'm really only attracted to. Oh shit, I forgot to tell you I was going to turn into a dude. We keep going, keep going. That would be cool if you could keep going because you'd already be horny. And then she'd be fine, I creeped out because she just told You about her uncle and then also in a big part decks in front of her. I think if I saw that actually happen, I would probably freak the fuck out.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Could you imagine just morphing like. Because there are certain animals that changed sex, that's not unusual in nature. It happens in a bunch of situations. Certain animals start off as a woman and they become a male or vice a versa. And they can change dependent on certain insects and certain worms and shit. I think they can change dependent on whether or not there's enough males or females in the population. It's variable. Yeah. There's a bunch of like simple organisms that can do that. So if simple organisms could do that, why can't I can't it fucking humans. That was this part of the movie splice. You don't even know the movie splice. Who's amazing movie. What's that guy's name? Adrian brody. I could've bought that movie for a brilliant scientist. And what he did was he managed to splice together. I don't know what it's like alien, what it was it like.

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       And some other shit it was, it was like a person and some other shit, like maybe a frog or something. They made like this little alien baby and this is how dumb the premises, they keep this alien baby app, this laboratory and it grows into a full grown human in like a couple of months and they just keep it in the basement and they just like hanging out with her in the basement. Now all of a sudden she's a chick and she's kinda hot except her eyes. You too far apart. That's like the only thing that he could tell. So this thing is like maybe three months old and it's an attractive woman thing and he liked it gets scared, but if it wants to kill you, okay. And then maybe three weeks after that he starts fucking at adrian brody is fucking this three month old alien baby thing. I swear I'll shut that thing off in the middle of my adrian brody story.

Speaker 6:          00:46:58       Anything that is, it's probably the fence toll free callIng.

Speaker 1:          00:47:07       well that's pretty weird. So he starts fuckIng the thing that's like, this thing is only a couple of months old. I would have not waited that long. I would have fucked that thing. The first, second day look like a girl and it was like, oh, I made you, wouldn't you? You would do the same thing. No, no, you wouldn't fuck this. First of all because it didn't look totally look like a person. He had wings. Okay. Crazy feat. It had like the, like the, the back

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       legs were like horse legs. Did a talk in english. Uh, you know, I made noises, noises. It was way retarded. And then at the end of the movie it becomes a male. Something happens, something happens. It goes through some really not feeling well and some weird thing it's going to die and it becomes a male. Adrian brody had sex with the male starts jacking and I think it kills adrian brody at the end. I don't remember. It was so bad. I couldn't remember. It was such a dumb movie. It was like it was over. You're like, shut the fuck up. Know there's no spoilers in this. But when you, when the movie sucks tab and we're allowed to talk about it, you know, it's like, it's fun. It's fun to watch because it's bad. Like I was a giggle fest. So she had boobs. Like did they have like some, a little tits?

Speaker 4:          00:48:16       Yeah. I said that could have turned me the right way. Well, she's real aggressive too. And big, like powerful and shows. He was really kind of creepy. BuT she's supposed to. She's supposed to be four fucking months old, you know, or whatever. AT the most six. She said they had to get out of the lab. You know, she acts like a child. She curls up and cuddles with them like a child and get scared and cries. But then like, eat a cat shit. Did he just start fucking her? Like raping her? Did he like her hair first started making onto him and next thing you know, he's boehner and I swear to god the whole theater is howling. Howling, laughing. Yeah. I mean I was, I felt bad that I was laughing. I felt I can't laugh at this. Fuck. I'm going to be, I'm going to be that dick and the movie theater laughing, but then other people started laughing too.

Speaker 4:          00:49:01       I was going, oh no. And then other people started laughing out loud and then it just became a wave through the whole theater. Everybody was just going no what? The people were just going, what the fuck ever. Elma fail. And that's one of the cool things about going to see a movie in hollywood. Like a lot of times we go see a movie in hollywood. Like, you know, there's a lot of cool people in the audience. Sometimes some shit, stupid, stupid shit will happen in the movie. And everyone agrees like everyone is like, what is this happened when I was watching the trailers to inception. Um, and it was, what's that guy making? He made that movie where everyone's in a village and they don't know the devil's it showed like his name in the whole same thing happened in my theory. I've been talked about that before.

Speaker 4:          00:49:44       I've seen it three times that the devil, when it came on it, everyone just started going, oh, this looks cool. But that mother of that fucking disappointing cock sucker, he needs to change his name. No man. I'm telling you. The devil movie was pretty good. I liked that movie. Yeah, I took a chance. I'm desperate. I'm desperate for good horror movie. But it seems like he's getting gotten to a point where a lot of people probably aren't going to watch that movie. Did not direct this. I don't think he just produced it bro. Man, you might've cost yourself $50 million bite. I was doing tech support two months ago and as I was working from home I'd watch horror movies over and over again, like just random ones on netflix. And I like watched probably

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       like two a day to the point where like two weeks went by and I'm like I need to switch it up. Like I've been watching this shit too much. I had like weird dreams and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       Sometimes there's a problem with like the celebrity pr director, like the shama lawns boom. You know, like because there's a bunch of movies that are really good movies that don't have that, you know, that doesn't say, you know, james cameron's boom, but there's when, when with certain dudes like their name, like m night shambhala dinged on is the number one. His name is just immediately associated with all of his movies. Did he fail at that? Everybody hates him so much. Also go one with the sixth sense was the last good one. Wider. Unbreakable was okay, but it was really slow. But then there was the water one was so dumb and the plant one and I didn't even see the plant one, but everybody told me to plant one was fucking god awful. Did you see the plant one and now happening? I saw now a gang of them that made me nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       Yeah. I saw. I forget which ones I can't remember, but I still take chances. I'm a sheep big film. What'd you? Friday night. The big film with cozy it. Fuck it. I'll just sit there and try to watch it, man, sit there with my popcorn and try not to think this is stupid, but that was a good movie that the devil was not bad. It was. It was tricky. It was good enough. You know, it was a, a good horror movie, you know? I expected it to. Soccer did not fucking not enough. Good horror movies out tHere, man. Couldn't monster movie. I think the human centipede was the last one I Watched. Was it more just gore of I want to see monsters when somebody makes some good models. Do you see human centipede? I got and I didn't want.

Speaker 5:          00:52:00       I watch it for the creek festival. I mean it's one of those movies I was going to turn off after the first 20 minutes. I just wanted to get a taste of it, but then I kind of got addicted to the fact that it was so creepy and I was just like, I got to see what's happening here. I mean, it's not good. I don't like it, but it's, it's, it's definitely worth seeing just because the characters in it are fucking creepy as fuck. Have you seen that? Maybe shutter island? Yes. Okay. That one was not surprising and whatever, but there's a movie called madhouse and it wasn't surprising because you kind of knew it was going to Happen. It's like, oh, he's obviously going to be the crazy person.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       That movie was a hot subject of debate amongst me and my friends. Really? Yeah. Most of us thought like I went to see you with sikora and with uh, eddie bravo and uh, they both. We all thought that it Was a bad movie. I felt like you can't just show me a bunch of shit and then say, oh, psych. He was crazy the whole time. It was all a dream.

Speaker 5:          00:52:54       If you go on like a netflix look at madhouse just like shutter island, but with like unknown actors, really completely better story. Better ending. Like I wished that one made it to theaters.

Speaker 1:          00:53:04       yeah, the shutter island, whenever it looked bad ass and it seemed kind of interesting, but when you found out that he was crazy, like halfway there was, there was one point in time when you kind of knew that things were a little wonky, like okay, this is all of a sudden we've entered into this unrealistic micozzie climbing up these mountains, you know, and by the ocean, remember that part by the ocean when climbed in the cave.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Right. And how can you start thinking, okay, obviously it's crazy like it's going on, but you can't have a movie where you have everything makes sense and then all the sudden it doesn't. And oh, it was a dream. Like that's like a cheap trick, like a slap in the face to all the viewers. Yeah, I mean I get, I get, you're trying to be crafty. It just, I don't think it's successful. I don't, I didn't think it was good. I wonder how some of these get put out and pass all the people they need to pass and then it gets such bad viewer responses. Well, the big part about the whole movie business is the producers. The big part about the movie business is that people that come up with the money, so it's not just, well, it's a bunch of different people get involved.

Speaker 3:          00:54:00       They, you know, it's not just the people who wrote it or the people who were performing the characters. There's a lot of other shit behind the scenes, you know, and there's a lot of cooks and everybody's got their own idea of what you should be in and should be not. And I've seen a bunch Of things that were really good, get fucked up a bunch of things. The man show and doug and I did it. That got all fucked up by other people involved looking at the screen, worn it movie man. Have you seen the premium that looks like somebody. I was going to say that the best example there was, um, there was a movie that I did a long time ago. It was a terrible movie. It was called frank mccluskey. Cei or pii private investigator, I think it was. Anyway, it was this kid, I forget his name, dave, who's the lead, who's a really funny guy, and uh, he was doing all these different.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       I Should respect to him find out what the fuck his last name is at green horn immediAte looks fucking now I'm wondering if it's supposed to be funny, but what I'm saying is with this guy, when I did this, this movie, I'm dave sheridan, that's his name, did this movie, this fucking kid. It's hilarious. And he would have in him and his friend wrote it, right? So he had like, they were like going over the scenes and what's the best way to make them funny and, and the dude was really good. Like he's a really good actor. He was in like, like I'm a scary movie and it's been in a bunch of different films. So anyway, he's, he's performing the scene and it like he'll come in and, and hit it his way, but there's all these. No one knows who this guy is, right?

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       So there's all these suits in the room and these guys would like fucking expensive cufflinks and rolex watches and suspenders. And they're given this dude literally giving him takes like do it like this. Like when you walk in, I want you to blow like this. I watched this guy do this and I'm like, this is what happens. When these motherfuckers get power, they all of a sudden they think that their creative, all of a sudden they want. They want to influence the these, these funny people making their shit. just because you've backed a bunch of movies and you've got a bunch of successful movies under your belt, doesn't mean you know how to make something funnier, but they all just want to get their greasy fingerprints on it. Like it's a big problem in hollywood. It's like no one lets like the smaller the group, the better. That's what it's got to be. The smaller the group, the better. And you can't make what they're doing better. You can't go in and go, no, no, you guys are focusing too much on this. It's too much that you've got to bring it back and make it like you. All you're going to do is cause chaos. All you're going to do is interrupt. So either they make something that you enjoy or they don't, but you can't add to the process. It's like saying if you were, if someone was building car, they're making a porsche

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       and you're like, I don't like the way this front end looks what I want the front end to be. Stick up like this. It's like a cobra. Like it's coming at you. And they'd go, hey, that doesn't work. Because there's aero dynamics. Like we need aerodynamics. He scientifically, it doesn't work, but I think it would really work. We got to figure out a way to make this work. And he'd be like, well, did this, this is stupid. You're not a car designer. What's the same thing with these assholes? They're not, they're not funny. They're not actors, they're not comedians. They're just fucking people with money that have financed a bunch of movies and get it. Yeah. So if you're doing a tv show, if you're doing a movie, there's a bunch of different people that have their say, you know, that's how john travolta gets cast as john gotti. There's a bunch you know and you know you're looking at a guy like that. You're like, okay, so big name. We'll get john travolta, john travolta, regati. It's very controversial. Maybe we should go with it. It's going to get a lot of press. John travolta's gotti. Yeah. Meanwhile, meanwhile, back at the ranch, I guarantee you if we find the guy who wrote that thing, he's probably fucking pulling his hair out.

Speaker 7:          00:57:17       John drove a whole dog freely. The previous work of all time for john gotti. I was a fucking. I was undercover. I wrote this book. I wore a wire. You pop socket. My life, my family's life. I'm fucking john travolta.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       Don't they love him for Greece though? Not anymore. No, no. After this picture of the inquire of him kissing another man. Really interesting you say I'm getting off as yet and there's a picture of him kissing a bunch of people that know him that he said it online that have said in interviews that thought it was like out. I thought it was like, you know, there was a big article and like think it was vanity fair. Some, some dude that drove walter used to bone, just talked about how, you know, he would just go to bath houses and shit and just hook up.

Speaker 2:          00:58:07       Remember the family guide with the last family guy, I think it was where it shows the Greece where they fly out into the air, like in the car and then it was like the, the, the bonus thing that they cut out the movie where they're just like, oh my god, it's cold up here. And that's cool up here, you know, because they're just flying through the sky and then she's like a warm me up, you know, hold me, warm me up. He goes, hey, I'm good. I'm good. A gay joke. Did your volt down? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       that's funny. You know, I, I, I understand that if he was gay and I'm not saying he is because I don't know, you know, but if he was, I totally understand them not wanting to tell people because of his business. You don't get to play the lead in movies if they know you're gay because there's just a big chunk of America like you know, fucking probably 30 or 40 percent. This is just not going to go see a movie where john travolta is kissing girls and it has a girlfriend or a wife. If you know that he's, he's gay,

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       don't you usually get to a certain point in money at least or where you don't need to worry about not getting lead roles anymore. You could still probably make money, you know, if. Especially if you're gay to commercials or that's easier said than done. Man. You know, a

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       lot of people don't want to disappoint their fans. A lot of people were worried. One of the reasons why, you know, certain alleged organizations protect their members from homosexual, you know, rumors and all, all, you know, anybody finding out that they're gay, it's because they're trying to protect them as a business. They're trying to use like a systematic approach as a business to maximize their opportunity. Look, if you can come out, but if you do, here's what's gonna happen. First of all, you're only going to come out to strangers. You're friends all know you're gay anyway, right? That's all that matters. Your friends and if you come out, there's a bunch of roles you're not going to get. There's a bunch of things you're going to get pushed away for and you just might be a few opportunities that you miss and when it's all over what's write a book, but write a book will say you get, but for now, let's say you're name.

Speaker 4:          00:59:56       Okay. And we'll throw in a couple of quirks are or perks. Likely. Yeah. You can be that the woman in hairspray. Sure. Every girl. Yeah. Yeah. It's kinda funny. You know, it's a fucking interesting thing man, though, the way the human sexual system is wired, there is this ad that are maybe like a preview on the news and it's like oprah tells a big secret like next week at four and I'm like, isn't it always kind of questioned? But she's a white man, white man. No one ever saw that coming. Oprah. Yeah. What is, what was the secret? I don't know. I don't think it aired yet. Her Big secret is that she's going to be a lesbian. And with that girl, right? People think that already. A lot of people think that I uh, why? What did you just bring up oprah? Like I was watching over it on the news, like bring chicks to the shoeburg. Start bringing. When do I watch oprah?

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       I watch it occasionally and just so just see. It's like, I just need to know that that site existed. He sits, scribed a day. Oprah channel, joe. Uh, no I haven't. You have to pay for it. I'll watch it would, you know, I mean I will every now and then just to see what the fuck is up. I watch everything, man. I watched hunting shows. I watch super, super right wing political shows. I watch. I watch people like a scientist, like I just want to know what the fuck is out there. You know, I don't watch a lot. A lot of shit. I don't watch for entertainment. I watched, I just watched to see what is this, you know, a go, you know, so many shows man, like religious shows. I love watching religious shows. Do they watch steve harvey on this religious?

Speaker 4:          01:01:29       It was fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       First of all, he's crying about the pressures of being famous. It was amazing. You know it was piece of cats, don't know. Cats don't know what it's like, like complaining about being this multi-multi millionaire celebrity and then he started talking about god and it was just brilliant. It was just amazing stuff. He was saying. He was like,

Speaker 4:          01:01:48       what did he say? It goes, if you can't, don't have god in his life, I don't even want to talk to you. You're silly. Silly person was awesome. Like if you don't believe in god, you're a silly person. Friend do that to me. She told me, allison, we can't be friends anymore because you're not a woman of god. And I'm like, bitch, I was fucking just started kissing her. is that what I should have checked her oil? Say, shut up bitch. You want to taste your pussy? Stuck my fingers in your pussy. Things like bad

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       girl, bad girl. She just would've went right with it. Their dirty little bitch. Yeah. So what? What did, how was the conclusion? Did you guys break up? No more friendly. We're besties.

Speaker 5:          01:02:32       Yeah. I know. We kind of met up I guess a year ago, but this happened like when you were 15 and I was like, are you crazy? Yeah. So french righteous little cunt. Yeah, it was weird. That's ridiculous. You don't know what the fuck is up and you're 15. You did go to catholic school. I went to catholic school for like four years. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       it was rough. So much guilt and strain and stress and so many people that come from guilt and strain and stress have their kids in there. So there's fucking straining in the home. Wow. Fucking want. I will just repression. And so one of the most depressing religions.

Speaker 5:          01:03:04       Yeah. I didn't like it at all. better. Used to go to confession for like once a week and I'm like, I'm not doing this. And I got kicked out in ninth grade. I went to public school.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       Sounds like religion. They would have gotten me if I was like, what? The mormons or something like that or someone fun. So it looks like they have a good time. I have friends that are mormons. When they go to church, it's like basically you sit around with a bunch of people's families, you say some nice things about god and you'll leave. Nobody feels like shit. Nobody feels like a fucking center. Like a piece of shit.

Speaker 5:          01:03:29       I talked to two mormons and be like a couple months ago while they were walking around and I was on a jog, we started talking and I said, oh, you guys don't ever have a time to relax, go see a movie or whatever. And they're like, no, we can only rest for seven hours on wednesday. And that's what we do our laundry. but the rest of the time we're scouting around and knocking on people's doors.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       Oh the, okay. You're talking about missionaries. People are on a mission. This isn't like, you know, everybody has an app to do that. No, these are just the people that want to like go and recruit people. Bicycle. And then I think they called them elders or something like that. Elder john. I'm like, what's your name? fucking hilarious. As a young dude coming up to you, colin, self elder the fuck out of here. Pretty hard. This, uh, this person that I know that is a mormon, I'm just recently, they've completely abandoned it, so it's been kind of fascinating. So they had some things happen to them in their life and they just decided the religion really doesn't make sense anymore. It's kind of weird. So weird wHen that happens, man, when all of a sudden someone just goes, oh, what was I doing? Like I knew people that used to be christians, like we're super super christian and then they just kinda lightened up on it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       But you know, like rampage jackson at one point in time, wouldn't swear, wouldn't stop swearing, didn't want to have premarital sex. So we got married, like the whole deal went super full blown christian. So that was just the gIrl making them do that. Probably. I don't know. I don't know man. I think at some point in time people get real, real nervous and they really want to believe that there's an answer. You know? They really want to believe that someone who's got a book from 3000 years ago with all the shit in it, it's all in here, man. It's all in here. You can live a perfect life and if you're around people that really, truly believe in, here's the deal, man. It fucking works. If you were around someone who's a real true, practicing christian, I mean, think about what that is for a real, true practicing, practicing christian.

Speaker 1:          01:05:12       You are just doing christian things. You're trying to be loving and love your neighbor and do charitable for your community. I mean, that's really what it's supposed to be all about and if you do that, that really will make you a happier person. So it does work, you know, even though it's, you know, it's the reason why it works is because you're tricking yourself into believing that this 2000 year old book written by people thought the world was flat in the son was 17 miles away, has all the fucking answers. That's ridiculous. But, but the, the fact that if you believe in something like that, it's like a placebo effect for your life. Yeah, I was actually at work and one of my bosses, he's a pastor also and he hands me that rick warren's book and he's like, what is that? It's like rick warren, like the chosen path.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       It's a catholic or a christian book that a pastor wrote. It's like one of the best selling books ever really told the um, the crazy ones are with the, is it, is it two guys? They have like some whole fucking, a whole series of like super, super, super popular books, but it's all about like the apocalypse. You don't know about this? Yeah, there's, I think there's a group of two guys and they're like the best selling authors in America and people don't even know about them. God, I got to find this out right now. I hate when this happens with these. Did you read the religious book? No, he handed it to me and I was like, what's this far? And he's just like, I want you to read this. And I'm like, well I don't want to read this so you could have it back.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       And he's like, why don't you want to read it? It's just like a briefing on the bible and whatnot, and I just told him, even though he's a pastor, like I don't want to read this. Let's say I'm at work right now. I don't need to read this. Here's the guys. There's two guys named tim lahaye and Jerry Jenkins and they write. This book's called the left behind series and were these lives and made them into movies and I have two of them have both of them because they're fucking awesome. And there were kirk cameron and it's all about how jesus comes back and everybody dies, but the christians get taken to heaven and everybody here is fucked. Do they get left behind? It's like fictional. Oh yeah. They believe it is the apocalypse. This is the real shit. God's going to come back and if you're not saved, that's why these not banks like kirk kirk cameron.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       That's what you see him talking to gang bangers and, and you know, trying to get them to, you know, to, to, to, to come to god. Like he really believes that jesus is going to just show up and everybody's going to be taken to heaven and everybody else is going to be stuck and fucked and left back behind here on earth in a godless world with no laws and all the good christian to be gone and there'll be stuck here. He really believes that and it's. These books are fucking huge, huge, huge sellers like millions and millions of copies. Some of the most successful books in America. Some of the most successful fiction or crazy shit lately. Full of shit. And he's just dolla. Dolla bills. well I don't think so man. I think they started out probably you can. I don't know man. You think they're full of shit completely. Who knows man. I mean look at like all these people that ever get in trouble for like, you know, I think he's gay. If religious guys, if I had a bet money on kirk cameron being gay or not gay dude, he had a perm when he goes on. Growing parents. Yeah. But that doesn't mean anything. So did. I'm trying to think of somebody good.

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       I think tommy morrison and made a perm at one point in time, he has aids

Speaker 1:          01:08:23       bad example, but um, when I see him like trying to convert people and i'M like, what are you running froM doing? Why Are you so into this? What's, what's that about why or why is that consuming your, your humanism? It's a, it's a gay thing or my kid's game game money and money and thanks. So

Speaker 2:          01:08:40       I don't know. To me it just seems like it's a smart thing that he's doing the same reason why there's clean comics. You had seen that, but this guy

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       goes into, has like debates against like scientists and they look really stupid. Him and his buddy, he's got a buddy that has a, I forget this fucking buddies is buddies. Retard ray comfort and never seen the banana thing, right? Where it says of the banana was designed by god and this is how we can prove it. He shows the banana fIts in your hand. Then he peels the banana and eats it and shows. This is the, this is a, um, an evolutionist nightmare because this is like clear evidence of creation that god has created this fruit. Like you fucking really meant that when he was saying it,

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       guy created a dick. It also fits in the hand. It also gives you juice when you were thirsty after killing dinosaurs. But no, no, the, he has to do that kind of shit though. In order for him to make this money. He didn't, to be legit to several of these books, he has to also do bullshit like that, you know, you would be, have to be a way better actor than he's capable of because these two guys were so dominant, these debates and they're, they're so fascinating. There's no way you could not believe what they're saying and say the things they're saying,

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       unless it's like one big gigantic, you know, multi-decade hustle. I don't think so. I think they're just knuckleheads, you know, I think there's knuckleheads and they get married to an idea and then they just stick with that motherfucker. Whether it makes sense or not. but these dudes, these left behind dudes. I want to know what, what their circulation is.

Speaker 8:          01:10:04       Mm,

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       sure you do, baby. That's their circuit asian.

Speaker 8:          01:10:08       Um, shit.

Speaker 2:          01:10:14       By the way, oprah disclosed that, that at her news was that she has a half sister. She didn't know about what? That's news. How ridiculous is that? How is that news? Right. Everything was oprah's news. I mean, it's kind of like when you get put in that certain class of why is that news will black lady and what is it that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       I can't find out how many books just think sold not quickly, but it was a fuckload officially a fuck load of books. That's all about these people being left behind. It's fucking awesome. If you ever want to get blazed and watch kirk cameron rocks, it's really

Speaker 2:          01:10:57       rather growing pain. that would be good to at least stay like tracy golds in there and you know, get. Ooh, let's get some tracy gold.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       I've been paying attention to what's going on in yellowstone. Yellowstone national park, you know, has a called dara super volcano that erupts every six to 800,000 years and just fucking continent killer. It kills almost everything on the content killed like two thirds of all living things on, on north America. Well, uh, the, uh, magma has been bulging and it's got these bulging pocket swells where the earth is lifting and there's all these forms, these photos of them online and the questions starting to freak out. When are we, they don't know. We'll see. It's been about 600,000 years. So it could, it really could happen. They're not, they were concerned. They said they were concerned for awhile, but then they're not now they're not anymore because it stopped doing what they were worried it could do. But the bottom line is it's completely unpredictable. They don't know what, when, when it can happen or why it happens or what causes it when they say it's a contract killer, like I could destroy the whole continent.

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       Is that like maximum? And the minimum is like, oh, it will ruin like the taco bell next door, you know? Well this is what it is, dude. It's 300 kilometers wide and it's a super volcano, which means when it blows up, you know, uh, mount saint helens is a volcano and then at the top there was a small area where all the water was shooting up in the air. Well this isn't like that with this is like the top part, but the top part is a 160 miles wide and it shoots straight up in the air like a fucking mile high wall of love, agitate. And then steve. Yeah. And then nuclear winter occurs because the entire surface of the earth gets covered in fucking ash. Like no planes can fly. Remember that little tiny baby as volcanic blew up in Iceland and everybody got fucked. Nobody can even fly anywhere. But when this one blows, it's they do anything. Like take the drill holes in it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:59       No, no, no. This is way too big. You got to move to Australia, bitch, move to Australia and have some canned food waiting. Seriously. If that motherfucker goes, if that mother fucker goes, it's going to go. You probably won't be able to do anything. You probably won't be able to get out in time. If we find out tomorrow that yellowstone is going to blow. What are we gonna do? Where are we going to go to san diego? That's why I keep that in my car job, my my emergency kit at all. I hope that thing has a motor boat and you're going to have to get the fuck put in there. That's a good idea to get one of those rafts blowup raffing. Sure. Because you know in Australia when it was fucking when, when these crazy floods hit, there were sharks in the street.

Speaker 1:          01:13:37       Sharks. people spotted sharks. Bull sharks swimming down the street. That's how much water. There wasn't Australia bringing guns. New molten lava was just coming and there is no escape. You kill yourself. It's not even that. It's not. The molten lava was goIng to fuck you. Yeah, that's bad. Lab is terrible, but when it's all the other stuff that's going to get you to the toxic rain, the fucking shit and the air wick, it fills your lungs up and kills you. Like a lot of animals, like they found all these woolly mammoths and they were all dead and um, they were dead in like this mask, like field of them. And one of the things they found was that their lungs were all filled with like sit. Her lungs were filled with like volcanic ash. And so what happened was they just got caught in some big volcano eruption and then just breathe in all that smoke and it literally turned their, their, their, their lungs into rocks and they just die.

Speaker 1:          01:14:28       You know, you gotta lungs filled with volcanic ash and it's like volcanic rocks, you know, basically in your body. It's terrible. It's terrible. Yeah. It cuts off your air. You can't breathe. You're all. You mean the air is thick with this shit and they all died. Have you ever thought you'd get one of those chemical max that you can get? Like at surplus stores? You know, like when you need that chemical mask, everybody's dead anyway, you know, if you needed that mean, what are you going to do? You're gonna, you're gonna. Be mad max. You're gonna. Be out there on your own. Go walk around and humps him dead ladies and grabbed some wallets. I dunno, a certain point in time. You got to say nighty night a heaven or hell, and I did kill myself in that situation. I hope that they'd be like, it's okay. We get it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       No. See they don't get it. There's no exception. That king

Speaker 1:          01:15:08       kill yourself. Kill yourself before you suffocate to death or molten lava that attacks your body. Like molten lava probably gives you a really quick. I mean if you fell in a bit, have you felt on a volcano? We'd take like one second. You would just disappear. Volcanoes and that's called. How long could you last? That's what they used to do, man. In Hawaii, people are douche bags. They throw him in fucking palae they throw in a volcano man, until he got rid of cons. Yeah, he's. Yeah. That's how they get rid of people. That's how they execute them back in the day sun back when motherfuckers wearing skirts. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? Throwing spears at animals and shit sacrificed wild wild pigs and shit. That'd be a wild place to live, throwing people in a volcano. There was a documentary on the lost tribes and all these different people that are still living in elected live thousands of years ago, all over the world. And uh, I was watching it and I was thinking to myself, man, what the fuck would I do if it all went back to this? How would I, would I even want to go back to this? Like what if society ended and all of a sudden you're making bows and arrows out of bamboo trees and making your own twine. You're trying to feed your family by hunting food. Fuck man. Really? What, why, why would you think that would be kind of like,

Speaker 2:          01:16:29       be like camping. And he'd be like fun for like a week and then you're like, I'm fucking hungry. There's nothing to eat around here except this bird that won't sit still and I need to make a, I

Speaker 1:          01:16:38       guess what, there's not that many animals. It's not nearly as many as you would need to sustain a population. Okay. You know, we think of, you know, we'll go hunting. Well, you know, there's no animals to hunt anymore. It's not like it used to be 300 years ago where you could go anywhere near here and it'd be deer everywhere and all sorts of other animals to eat. Like we pushed all those bitches out. There's nothing left. You know, occasionally you'll see a deer in hollywood, you know, like, um, you ever drive up laurel canyon and see a dear family and shit. It's a trip, you know, it's like, wow, you guys are still here. Huh? Me that yesterday. If you ever see it around here, it seems very empty and we'd be fucked. We'd have to start eating each other probably. No, definitely dogs first.

Speaker 1:          01:17:19       Then people. There's no other food. How many fucking cows are they around here? If you've got no more cars. Okay. Cars don't work anymore. Let's just get crazy. Right? What are you going to do? You got no phones will start eating people, right? Yeah. And then you're going to probably kill yourself. You gotta try to figure out a way to kill yourself after you've eaten a few people and you feel bad. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I couldn't person. Would you rather die? Uh, yeah. I would kill myself before I hear a person. Speaking of killing yourself, this fucking bath salts thing. Have you heard about this? Yeah. I have this craziness. This is for the folks that haven't heard, and this is not a joke. This isn't the onion. Okay. This is the huffington post, which is sometimes almost as funny as the onion, but in a different way.

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       Anyway, this is what they're saying is that there's chemicals that are sold as bath salts and people are taking these and again high with them and it's making people like crazy suicidal, do a nutty shit. Like there's one guy took a skinning knife, it says slit his face and stomach repeatedly. He survived, but other people haven't been lucky as was snorting or injecting and snorting powder such as innocuous sounding names as ivory wave read, dove and vanilla sky. So it basically turns you into some fucking homicidal suicidal maniac. That's crazy. Who was the first person who did that? Fuck. Yeah, I mean, what? What is it about people that were so desperate to change our state of consciousness, so desperate to get drunk or high or speak in which you're fucking drunk. CasT. Okay. I've been meaning to do this intervention and do it on the air because this is an intervention.

Speaker 1:          01:19:03       I need to talk to the both of you. Okay. You can't drink like that that often? No, we don't do that. You're gonna die and you're going to die on camera. You're going to have fucking liver failure on camera and that's going to be a sad show. We waited like 10 days between the both. You fine me. His motherfucking calls me up. You got research. I got you sick, dude. I saw you fucking shit. Faced slurring. Hammered on the ustream. Bato jaeger bottle. Jaeger master. you're blaming me for you being sick. Shut the fuck up, man. Yeah, you pulled should be sick. You crazy. Fuck nuts. Still sick. So what they do is for the folks at home to do not know about this, they do this thing called the drunk cast. He calls it blackout cast or drunk cast and he's done it a few times and they do it. Sometimes they do it and they watched the ufc, which is pretty cool. they'll watch the fights and then like while the fights are going on, all these comics are commentating on it. It's really funny, you know, like joey's over there and sam trIpoli and tb and um, well the latest thing is they drank a whole fucking bottle of jaeger and just get completely. It's like an hour or tWo. It was not, it was not like the promise. We've done

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       two of that blackout cast, which is where we take a whole bottle and we start going crazy. First one was the jaeger might've jaeger meister bottle and we did that in like an hour and then don't remember the last half of it to remember the next day for the first couple of hours, you know, I don't remember anything. Then the second one we didn't feel like when you watch the video, that one was funny because it was. Yeah. But the last one was so bad. You took it down. I. Well, I'm debating on it because the problem was, is the ufc drunk casts was right before it and we got sloshed on the drunk cast, like we wasted at the end of the, the, the, the last one. Uh, and then, uh, we decided like an hour later, hey, we're still drinking, let's do a black outcast. But then we were so wasted that we, we couldn't even think of what to drink. So we're drinking coconut water with vodka. We were doing just like straightened morgan's good. It was actually good. It was pretty good. Did you do it over the rocks, huh? Yeah, it was good. It takes a, took off the edge of the vodkas that tastes like or take a walk. But we had like, we had jaeger vodka beer and captain morgan. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:21:15       And were drinking all those mixes two days in a row. So two days in a row. You're basically drinking cast is when? No, that was an hour before we started this blog post. The same day. It was an hour hour podcasts in the same day. Oh, I thought it was the day before. Oh my god, that's ridiculous. No poor fuck it was. I don't think you should post it because we just got so on social. It was a. It was like this. This is an impersonation of most of the. Of the law. That blog out one good. Leave it. Leave it up. Dude. That's important man. That's part of the entertainment. That's. Listen, that's part of the entertainment value. We don't. People have to watch it. you're not forcing them. You're not charging them for it. It's up there. Leave it up there and maybe I'll put the audio, but the video, the videos.

Speaker 4:          01:22:00       How bout this? How bout we record? We take the video and record you guys doing commentary. That would be funny and we have it playing on and then get it to a certain point where it's like, were you just not even talking anymore? And then just start explaining things and what was going through my head. Should I puke now or should I? Can I hold it in or can I get to the bathroom? Keeping on camera. Yeah. I tried. There was a part where I get a bag in a bag and then she ended up puking you and you ended up licking his fleshlight you should've thrown out. That was at the ufc drunk. He did that. That was how drunk she was at the usc drunk has. I mean, we really were like bad. That last one. I don't know if I can. I think the secret is starting off completely sober and then drinking a whole bottle in an hour or something. Did the porn stars touch your flashlight? No, they wouldn't. They were like, I'm not going to touch that. That's hilarious. It girls pickets shit out of her teeth with her fingernails and she said the flashlight and then allison kissed it. She didn't clean.

Speaker 2:          01:23:07       It was clean, right? I listened. It's washed, but the bottom line is, well, it's like shaking hands with a dude.

Speaker 3:          01:23:14       If you shake hands with the dude, you're basically touching his dick because every guy touched his dick and the odds of him having washed his hands after he touched his dick before he touches your hands, they're like 70 percent against most of the times. You know, when you're not around, we were always grabbing our dicks and moving it around or grabbing our balls. Like you shake your hand, you're touching his balls.

Speaker 2:          01:23:33       There's one point in the drunk cat. So which, this, this, this, this, this, this is true. We kiss a girl. You're sucking someone's deck. I don't think I ever told you this. This is a true story, a crazy story. Uh, so I used to work at this mexican restaurant and I was a waiter and the waitresses were, there was 1:18 year old waitress, like three slash 17 year old waitresses. They're all fucking hot and they all had a crush on me. It's important of music. And so anyways, uh, I started having sex with the 18 year old hostess player back in the day. She had a party once. Where did she invited all the hostesses and was. So it was me, her, and like three other hostesses were all getting wasted drinking. I bought them alcohol because that's what I like to do. But anyways, uh, the party starters here, I was like, how can I make out with all these, take advantage of all these girls at the same time?

Speaker 2:          01:24:22       And so I thought up this idea where I took saran wrap and I would put it in between my mouth and the girl's mouth go, if you want to make out, you're not touching me so we can pretty much make out as much as you want and we'll feel real. They were like, holy shit, that's awesome. And so I would just start making out old. Were you when I was 18 and they were 18 and they fell for this 13 year old. No, no, no, no. It was great. It's like I would on a couple of the girls that had a little hole in the thing that I find my tongue and they wouldn't have noticed because it felt it feels real. And then I started taking saran wrap and putting on my hands. But like I can touch your boobs because I'm not actually touching a serial killer.

Speaker 2:          01:25:02       And this is a, this is a good move. Yeah. And so I did that. We were so drunk I started getting mad. So tell me more about this move. So the girls let you do that? Yeah. Oh yeah. All of them. No, it was up the shirt making out and this shirt and they were drawn to it. You just have. And what was so funny is, is that the girls could feel, when I put my hand up with the plastic on, like it was like not like half, like the saran wrap wasn't covering my hand half the time to do that and it was just like, dude, this move is awesome. Wild julian. Julian assange is in jail for rape for way less than that. Right. And so then then the one girl I was fucking with, like I went and had sex with her and whatever that later that night, and they all, the other girls like passed out in the living room. I came out and this one girl was like still awake, horny. And she called me over. He started making out and we had sex in there and then it led to sex even. So.

Speaker 3:          01:25:55       So you think you started a competition by filling up all these girls and being the only male, right? You, you started a competition, right?

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       You created an unfair game. It was a very smart move. It was very similar to. The pound was strong. So I, I pulled them out on allison and feel real. It feels real, right? Like it felt completely real. Pulled them little young kids out there. He's like, I'll use saran wrap. I'm like, okay, so why don't you use condoms? You don't even really fucking. That's what you're pretty much doing face condoms and condoms. Wow. Pitch that. The trojan. Yeah. If you had a really strong plastic, like really strong one and you could put your whole body and cover your entire body in this sheet of plastic. Sure. Let's try it out. Look, I can show you how real it feels. Do you want to make out scene on, on today's show? How dare you on today's big thing. That website said earlier, they had this thing where it's called the creepiest man alive and he blows himself up in balloons and he sits in there and hangs out.

Speaker 4:          01:26:56       I wouldn't say he's the creepiest man alive if you need to get online. Right. It's titled the title. They're just being silly or it's not really the creepy. That would be hilarious if I lived in a balloon, invited girls into my balloon. The best thing ever, and it's what's called today's big thing, not today's big thing. Dot com can never fucking keep track. All these sites are now. That's a good one. Very good one. Today's big thing.com. There's just. when is the internet ever going to run out a website? Addresses? I don't know because that just start adding more dots. Dots, dots. It's always weird when you're like, dot, are you? Hey,

Speaker 1:          01:27:35       his fucking. We tried to. We tried to give me a virus. Jack. MY jack, my shit. If I look at it like a russian website, I go, ooh, red Romania. I was reading this thing and I'm a. I believe it was in wired about this one area of Romania that has like a, just a gigantic percentage of the world's hackers and they're all driving around like mercedes benz's and they're all like, you know, like young, loud mouth kids that just hackers, just jacking people all these scams, like how many times a week do you get, you know, dear sirs, I need help from you and in exchange you will have access to my grandfather's fortunate of, you know, whatever the fuck it is and this is what I need you to do. How many of those. Again,

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       I got one today that was so hilarious. That was from microsoft xbox award show soccer at g mail or something like that. And it says, oh my goodness, you have won the grand prize for the microsoft word national holiday, something like that. Sponsored by soccer. You have another. Can you pull it out? Let me see if I can pull it up. I, I, I, I, oh, those are the best in the nation. They're from Nigeria. I wonder if I can get that. I don't give a fuck. And Nigeria, winter of microsoft, Nigeria is the wild, wild west, wild, wild west. But I loved how they were throwing in so many key words that even if my mom saw it, she probably be like, well, it is from microsoft word, you know? Uh, hold on right. Here we go.

Speaker 2:          01:29:03       [inaudible] shit. Did I delete that? So it came in as spam? No, it came into my inbox, but I think I marked it as spam, so I don't know what happens to that. Check your trash. I did check it. It's not there. [inaudible]. I don't have it anymore. Oh brian. But I literally just put it on. Oh, here it is. No, I got it. Great.

Speaker 1:          01:29:24       I got a wHole section. I saved my email.

Speaker 2:          01:29:27       The wording on this right here it goes. It's from microsoft. Two thousand 11 g mail at f, fifa World cup lottery.com. It says, dear winner, please check the attachment below. And it says, dear winter, microsoft corporation management worldwide are pleased to inform you that you are a winner of your annual microsoft word lottery lottery. It saYs it twice conducted in africa, being the host of the present fifa world cup, mega jackpot winning program, your personal gmail address or company email attached to the microsoft word with serial number. You are lucky number and you won. You tHerefore been approved for lumpsums of one point one $900, million thousand payable in cash credited to file number bet. Something from total prize money of $50 million united state dollars, whatever. What are they asking for? It says protect. Our participants were selected from g-mail worldwide websites throughout our microsoft computer ballot system, drawing from 21,000 names, blah, blah blah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:45       So what do they need you doing?

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       So then it says there's some phone numbers and it gives some emails, which would be great if we could call this person right now. It says it must be claimed. I have to fill out this thing in order to avoid mistakes.

Speaker 1:          01:31:01       Yeah. Well, okay. What do you have to do? What do you do? You need to give them money?

Speaker 2:          01:31:04       No, it says the name, address, nationality, sex, age, occupation. Um, no. It looks like I just have to call this person back and that's when they start asking for numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       Yeah. And they probably, when they get all that information, like name and all that jazz, they probably zoom in on you than they do an internet search for you and then they just start targeting you and going after you.

Speaker 2:          01:31:22       I liked this asis, lottery sponsors, sponsors, microsoft corporations, and then it's just photos of all these pictures of people winning state lotteries area. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:31:34       I got, I get a bunch of different kinds. Some of them that are like, they're like, you know, it's a different kind of scan. Like this one I got the other day. uh, I don't know who the fuck this guy is. So is ryan keegan? I have no idea. I don't know any ryan keegan's. Hey, how you doing? I made a trip to london two days back. God mugged at gunpoint last night. All cash credit card and phone was stolen. I got messed up in another country. I'm stranded in london. It was a bitter and I was

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       hurting my right hand, but I think I'd be just fine. I'm sending you this message because I don't want anyone to panic. I want you to keep it that way. For now, my return flight leaves in a few hours, but I'm having trouble sorting out my hotel bills, wondering if you loan me some dollars to sort out the hotel bills and also take a cab to the airport about $2,500. I've been to the embassy but they aren't helping issues have. I have limited means of getting out of here, so I really need your help, but I guess he sends this to like, you know, I guess you send this to like a million people and you get a few bites and all you need is a few bites. If you could do this with a computer, if a computer can generate a whole gigantic email list that you can steal from something or buy like a lot of them, I bet you can buy them. You know what I mean? There's a bunch of different corporations for sure that they've gone on a business and you. You ordered something online and they sell your email address and they have a database. They sell their database,

Speaker 4:          01:32:54       it doesn't matter. It just amazes me that they're so. They're also stupid sounding like, like at least go, hey, well, let's talk about. We talked about earlier the waitress that wouldn't shut the fuck up. The joey diaz had to give him a beating too to tell her, you give me an ear beating or if you took that woman and all of a sudden she gets this email, right? I don't. Who are you? Where do we know each other? They should add something like, hey, have you seen black swan yet? That was awesome. Like they can make was stuck in london, man talking about box. Microsoft word. Me too. Anyways, I need money.

Speaker 5:          01:33:25       He gets one old retired woman who has alzheimer's and just like, oh my gosh, where I am.

Speaker 3:          01:33:31       Those people out there, there's a lot of little little like manboys out there too. There's a lot of people that are like children. you could take their money.

Speaker 5:          01:33:37       That's, oh my god. I talked to this photographer and he has a friend that does this organization called project child safe where they get a bunch of money together and this guy flies out to other countries and takes back like kidnapped kids, like the movie taken and brings them back here. Yeah, I guess like the government has nothing to do with it. It's all like privately run and the do nothing right now. Wow. That is a lot of gunfire. I would imagine.

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       Like a stolen kid for my family are pretty much kidnapping, but they go to other countries. Right. That's scary. Shit. That's. That's a good. That's a good reality. Show project child safe. No shit, but I bet you couldn't fault it would be a little conspicuous running around with a gun in their hand, sneaking around the corner with fucking camera guy and like a boom. Here's another one that I got that was a much more subtle one. Attention. How are you doing?

Speaker 3:          01:34:24       Hope? Fine. Question mark. Sorry for the late email update. I want to make fast contact with Mr. David deutsch in regards to your released project fund

Speaker 4:          01:34:37       and some. Why do you save them? I save them all. I just save them all. I got one from the first bank of Nigeria from 2009 that I saved. It's a collector's item. Listen to this unread. Listened to the first line. The first bank of Nigeria. Remember that? Listen, this one dear. This letter is written to you in order to change your life from today.

Speaker 1:          01:35:01       Grab me so far. I'm riveted. I am mr James lewis, the director, international remittance department of this bank, comma, my boss, Mr. Jacobs. No comma, just a slight space am smith comma the managing director, ceo of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all power have been vested on me to make all international payments from Nigeria. Yeah, it's awesome. It's so bad. It's like, do you have microsoft word? Motherfucker? What did you run this shit through? Google translate paint brush and text edit. They must've just raN it through a translation program, right? They don't know what the fuck they're saying. That's what it is. It's been translated like they do it millions and millions and millions. There's a part of me that is absolutely fascinated by this because what I'm getting here, right, okay. I'm sitting in front of my computer and I'm getting this direct connection with some fucking guides who are basically like gollum from the lord of the rings. you know what I mean? Like think of like some of the people in Nigeria see the somali pirates and all these fucking nuts. They got me. It's A wild, crazy savage world there and they're just millions and millions of email just trying to fuck people out of their money. How are you getting any.

Speaker 5:          01:36:17       That's what these guys are doing. Episode of intervention on annie and I'm. One of the guys was getting interventioned because he was addicted to replying to those kinds of spam emails. He blew his whole retirement and he'd be on the phone with africa and they'd be like, we need 30 more dollars. He's like, okay, I'm right on it. And he's like, I'm not getting scammed. I'm just waiting for my prize money. And his family is like, he does this intervention intervention. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:37       That, that they shouldn't even waste a show on that guy. They should just slap them, you know, they stopped them a couple times wasting a show. It's fascinating. You know, we, we talked about tHis one guy that was getting scammed by these are nigerian dudes and they pretended that they were hot check and it was a famous porno star and they used her photos and this poor fucking guys, you know, like the sad old 60 year old man and he thought that it was real. I thought that he was really going to meet this is his queen. What happening? This dummy flew to london 14 times, 14 times for whatever reason they could never quite hook up. There's a good website called for 19 eater.com and they pretty much just screw over all the scammers. THat's really a whole website for 19 eater.com is like a yelp for scammers.

Speaker 1:          01:37:23       It's, it's like opposite trolling baiting. Right. Stan was stan hope used to do that all the time. Standing up piece to bait child molesters. I think you read a book about it. Did he? Didn't he publish all of them as a book or something? It seems like it to do it for a job or I only did it for, to be doug. Stan hope that's just how stan ho brock said he was, um, contacting these, uh, these child molesters and then it take all the, like, all the fucked up shit that do we say to them, you know, pretending he was like a little kid and they would, uh, put it online. There was a whole website, [inaudible] dot org. Remember that? Yeah. It's still around. I don't

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       think so, but that for 19 is awesome. You gotta check that out. There's like the, the hall of fame, the trophy room where, you know, in these

Speaker 3:          01:38:04       people debating dot orgs here because it. Yep. This is, we'll welcome to [inaudible] dot org. One of the most fucked up sites on the internet due to the massive amount of sexual content on this site. We felt it was in everybody's best interest to give you the phone disclaimer and then you go in and it's all. It's the whole thing is all them baiting child molesters. It's the fucking standup stuff though, if you could find it. Yeah. There's a bunch of them. You could see him nearby stan hope and their god damn genius.

Speaker 4:          01:38:32       you know, I think half of my lung is filled with incense. You got some crazy insect that was like incident log, fire log of innocent. That's the real shit man. I get the front of the jamaicans outside of the house of blues. Is it too much? It's almost like I feel like I don't have any air breathing and 100 percent I'll kill it. Don't be a pussy. Meanwhile you smoke cigarettes. I know my eyes are watering though. We're all like [inaudible]. Do you feel it? Like it feels like it's just thick now that you're saying and I'm noticing it, but I wasn't noticing it before. Oh, you know what I'm trying to do, man. I'll try to recreate what it used to be like back in the day when I started out in the comedy because I was mad and he could just go into a smoky room when you knew that just dark shit was gonna happen

Speaker 3:          01:39:25       about those smoky rooms, man, where you just, you just knew. No one's taking care of. They're healthier, right? This is, this is a place of deviance. That's, you know, that's why I used to love smokey pool halls. Pool balls used to be the best. He'd go In to clock in the morning,

Speaker 4:          01:39:39       packed in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke. yeah. It's probably not so good for you, but something about it. It's just got the worst. Is waking up the next day though in smelling your clothes. Oh god. Even as a smoker that. That's disgusting. Yeah. They stIll have one of those in orange county near where I live, um, to bar with the pool tables and stuff. And you could smoke cigarettes inside.

Speaker 3:          01:39:58       I was having this conversation with a buddy of mine about those natural cigarettes. Are those things any better for you?

Speaker 4:          01:40:04       I don't think so. It's like vapor and there's like no carcinogens in it or something like a little bit, but it's still tobacco, right? Smoking tobacco is not good for you. Right? well, there's no smoke. That's correct. It's kind of like, what are you talking about? I'm talking about cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigarettes. I said natural, like those, those american spirits things like are those better for you or better for you because it doesn't have like 102 other chemicals in it and. YeaH. Yeah. So yeah, it's better for you than having a marlboro light. It is, but I also have noticed when I smoke those, it's like, it takes forever. Like it's like two hours. It's like I'm smoking 20 minutes instead of five minutes. You know, it's like a bonfire. Just not the same. It's good. I like it, but it's. If it feels like you're, you're smoking more bonfire. That's

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       an Interesting way of describing it. Like when you get smoke in your mouth, when you're near a fire, it's like you cough on it tastes nasty leafy and drive like, ooh, that doesn't sound good. Let me go old bites. He barely even feel like you're smoking, you know? It just feels calming or something. I don't mind tobacco man. I liked tobacco in the form of cigars. Tobacco, When you smoke a big cigar, like especially if they have like a big meal and have a big cigar. so garza gives you like a weird buzz man if you're trying to pipe what's her, even if you're not in like inhaling Mr. Guy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. For sure. Because he just comes into your blood's dry, uh, your uh, your bloodstream through your mouth immediately. By the way. A lot of people don't know that, but like anytime there's smoke in your mouth, it's almost immediately in your blood sweat.

Speaker 1:          01:41:36       That's when people say like, I'm not going to inhale this weed. You know? You're still getting fucking stone. Yeah. As bill clinton, you dumb so fucking dumb. I didn't inhale. we. Okay, good. Did he didn't get as high, right? You still got high silly. You should not get high on andy. Got bath salts pretty high. Are they gonna start recalling basketball. Yeah. They're making some bath salts illegal in Ireland right now. It's an epidemic all across the world. I wonder what it'd be like. The snort mr. Bubble dude, this shit. It's a weird thing is it's the names of it. Ivory wave, bliss, white, lightning, hurricane charley chemicals can cause hallucinations, paranoia, rapid heart rates and suicidal thoughts. It makes you attack yourself and it makes your nose smell great. You know what your body is probably. Your body's probably so mad that you're such a dumb cunt that you snort bath salts that your body's like, oh, we're going to kill ourselves now.

Speaker 1:          01:42:31       All right. You want to do this bitch? You want to do this? Get a knife. Well, can't you? I mean, you can pretty much get fucked up on almost anything if you want to get fucked up to the point where you want to slash your face off. I mean, they're listening to the things that people are doing, man. They're like, they're like attacking themselves. Yeah. They're still conscious and alive and causes. Apparently it's super, um, the stimulants and our neurotransmitters in the brain. They're saying and this stuff, mp mdpv and method drone or they're made in the lab and there aren't regulated because they're not marketed for human consumption. So these things are in these bath salts. How the fuck is this stuff in bass off that's like, you're like taking a bath with crank. Like this is what you're doing. You're taking a bath with pcp.

Speaker 1:          01:43:14       Why was that in there? Isn't it supposed to be salt? What the fuck is going on? And trips your pores open and then you know, it gets in there and washes around. It causes intense cravings for it and they'll binge on it for three to four days before they show up in an er and even though it's a horrible trip, they want to do it again and again. It's incredibly addictive. Wow. This is nuts. Twenty five states have received calls about exposure, including Nevada and California. Louisiana leads with the greatest number of calls at 165. One hundred and 65 fucking people. I need to go to bed, bath and beyond tonight. Wow, this is crazy. You might as well try it before they recall it. We stock up on it. This is really nuts. Forty eight different calls are 38 different calls. It's like the highest demanded drug.

Speaker 1:          01:44:05       Now soap cast that. That's what strange, strange thing that all of a sudden they figured out that they get smart. It's almost like you found another hole in the system. Like people want to get high. So bad. You know, the fall we found this new shit. Hundreds of people are doing this. This is crazy. Wow. Apparently it's not something you do recreational. It's not like you're going to try to. I didn't like it. He'd do it and you get a face slash and zombie. Wow. This is nuts, man. I wonder if you could just do a little bit less of it and not turn into a face slash name is already. Maybe they're just doing way too much. He kind of like, whoa, here it is. This is what they're saying. The problem grew in rural Mississippi. After a law began restricting the sale of pseudo f, f a dream, the key ingredient, and making methamphetamine pseudoephedrine pseudoephedrine.

Speaker 1:          01:44:56       So when they stopped selling that stuff, we're restricting the sale of it. They couldn't get meth anymore, so they got crazy and then they tried this shit. This is worse than math. This is something that's fucking up meth heads. Like they used to just be meth heads and then they started doing bass to cutting their faces off. I want to hear about the kids who tried it, who started this phenomenon. I don't think it was the kids. Yeah, but it wasn't kids really. Governor happened. I bet there was some fucking crazy guy like in that breaking bad show. There was some, some, some sort of a scientist character and he realized that bath salts will fuck you up to. So just started giving them to people. That's possible, but you can't even corner that market if you tell them it's bath salts. So they must have held at gunpoint to get the secret sauce. This is the greatest fucking crack of all time, man. Shit, I'm taking over the world. Listen to co.

Speaker 2:          01:45:47       Just magic getting to the point. Remember when you used to get those things for christmas where it was like a bag of bath salts, you know, it was like a decorative item given to you by, uh, like, have you seen them? It looks like a snowball, right? And that's going to be like your, your, your april is one of those.

Speaker 1:          01:46:05       Wow. There aren't the, aren't regulated. That's the real problem. Meanwhile, they just made fucking five methoxy dimethyltryptamine illegal. They made. It's super illegal. Now you can't get it anywhere. If you have it, you're in trouble. That shit used to be able to. You still have buying online five methoxy dimethyltryptamine, which is the most potent form of dmt used to be able to buy it online. Yeah, you can buy a jug of it and just get blasted on it till the end of time. Now it's a schedule one. Yeah. Now it's right there with a. With a marijuana. Yeah. Used to be able to just buy it. It's weird and then someone figured out like, hey, you can get really high off this shit, and you just buy it online. That's pretty silly. If you get caught with acid, you go to jail forever. Not forever, but you get caught with anything.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       Anything like acid or playing footsies me here. If you get caught with any kind of acid, you know any, any, anything where they think you're doing that. When you're making your own drugs, that's. That's even crazier than mushrooms or pot because you're. What are you doing? You're. You're synthesizing a chemicals specifically for the purpose of getting people fucked up. A, you're a. You're a special case. You're in a fucking. You know, you got like rubber gloves and shit and a lab coat on and your in your bathtub and you're making enough acid to get like a whole state high. You can make a. You can make enough acid in your bathtub to get like a million people

Speaker 5:          01:47:23       excellently. Splashing it onto your. Oh my god, it took me five years to make disaster because every time I would die for like two months. I met this girl a couple years ago and she told me that she has this friend who obviously went crazy, moved away to a different state, but she got pulled over by the cops and had a whole vial of acid on her and she drank. She tripped for like 60 days and fucking like split town and like, it's been a weirdo ever since. I never met the girl. God, why don't you just pour it on the ground are ridiculous. Or just

Speaker 1:          01:47:59       start going doon, doon, doon, doon gould who do come to life. It becomes a transformer. Wow. I've heard stories about people. That's the number one drug that I've heard stories about. People losing their shit on. Yeah. Just breaking, you know, just see, you broke it broke it I think. I think acid in any, like any secondary given dmt. I think if you do it a certain amount of times, you're probably not going to be the same as before. I knew what do to did it 100 times and he totally became crazy. He just was doing dmt all the time to the point where when he would do dmt, dmt entities would talk to him and go, do, do, do, do you get to stop coming here to settle the fuck down and killing our bus. Dmt. And when you have a dmt experience, like a lot of it is marked by communication with whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 1:          01:48:47       You could be that you're communicating with some other part of your consciousness that you don't normally have access to. Or it could be the great beyond like this well of souls or it could be aliens and another dimension. You're communicating with something. Whatever it is is really just speculative. But this guy, when he would go over there, the dmt, whatever he was connecting to, what's going on? Dude? Dude, dude, dude, stop. Stop smoking. Bmp everyday. This is crazy funny. When the dmt spirits are actually annoyed with you. Come on dude, come here all the time. Whether they fucking eat my food, your stinky feet or on my couch the fuck bro. Get it together. That's funny. Yeah. You know, man, until they figure out a way to let people do whatever the fuck they want with their bodies. Do whatever the fuck you want. You're going to always have a gang of different drug problems. Where people are afraid of though is that when you start making everything legal, well then you know, we'll put kid could get a hold of it and everyone could get addicted and that is definitely true. You do run those problems. You do run a chance there being a little bit of a spike

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       once it becomes initially legal, but you, you, you're gonna have to let people learn. You have to raise your kids and tell them to never do that shit. You have to be around other people that raise their kids and tell them, you know, don't do math. It's gonna. Kill you. I don't do heroin. It's bad for you. You could smoke pot. It's not going to hurt you if you drank, let me know. I want to be there. I want to let you know. I want to make sure you don't drive home drunk. You know, like you can. People can navigate their way through a lot of different substances and the society if you just allowed us to, you know, but as soon as you start making shit illegal and restricting the, you know, the access to a bunch of different things, people can't figure out what's good and what's bad.

Speaker 3:          01:50:24       That's why there's a lot of people to think that mushrooms will fuck your mind up. Know and that smoke pot, you're become a lazy piece of shit. Why? Because they don't have access to it. If they have, if everybody had access to it, especially wheat, if everybody had access to, we'd, we would all think of it the same way that stoners think of it stolen or is pretty much universally look at pot and say, well, it's very beneficial to me. It calms me down. It gives you perspective. It makes me silly and then there's the medical uses for it all. I mean, it's like universal amongst the people that use it. Well, how come the other people don't share that opinion? Well, it's because they're not using it. It's really that simple. The people that are anti pot, it's possible that you have some weird reaction to pot, in which case I would say, hey, don't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:00       You know, you don't have to do it, but I guarantee you if you're not doing it and you're describing what it is you don't know or they a mom or a dad or brother that was like lazy as shit while they spoke to me, is that like, oh no, I totally get that. And I'm like, no, it's not like that. Your brother is fucking lazy. They don't see enough ambitious donors out there. People don't understand it. It will give you a different perspective and it might not necessarily be a better perspective, but it's good to look at things a different way all the time. Every now and then rather, you know, if you look at things the exact same way, you can get locked into sort of a mental pattern where you think that things make sense, you know, and then you need like a, a good, good, really fucking good real good bake session where you just completely float away, you know, when you and your friends are sitting around like how many times did we had these conversations like especially like after shows or were just completely barbecued, like eating dinner and we're all just like breaking down the universe or figuring out life or just having these conversations where you almost connect.

Speaker 3:          01:52:00       Can't get there on your own. You don't. There's some conversations with you. You get to when you're high and you're like, man, I don't think I can take responsibility for this conversation. I don't think I ever would have got here. Everyone was on high, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:52:12       Of course a lot of those conversations are not as cool as they would be in there. Just talking about how fritos would be getting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You know, I like those talks. I was really, really nice marijuana driven talks because you can't get that when you're hammered. No, no, you don't. Right. It's more like a good, a good stone

Speaker 3:          01:52:31       conversation. Not a dumb one, but a good one. You know everybody's kind of in that grove man. You figured out a lot of shit in those conversations.

Speaker 2:          01:52:39       The nick swardson have a jaguar, a, I don't know. No category. They just put on tmz that he. Somebody stole his jaguar

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       last week outside the improv on a friday night, but it happens or he's just trolling tmz. Do you think you would troll dmz? I don't see him having. He didn't have. You can't say that you got your car stolen. They can find that out pretty easily unless there's that lazy. Well not the felony to tell tmz ally behind it. Not just telling tmz. Tmz. You just can say whatever. Yeah. You can say whatever the fuck you want those concepts. The whole. The fucking jim norton. Over this weekend I saw jim norton at cap city comedy club and I was in austin. I was down in austin for the fight for the troops and I had friday off, so I went to cap city at norton, had some of the funniest fucking jokes on tiger woods. Oh my god. He was killing me and mel gibson, he was fucking killing me dude.

Speaker 1:          01:53:36       Really, really funny shit. Putting out with them after. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We, we went out to eat and club soda. Kenny was there and chris, chris from the flusher joe. Yeah. He's a good guy. And uh, but it was just, it was so fun and refreshing and right when I think that, like I always start thinking maybe I have too many dick jokes. Like why is my sense of humor so juvenile, like it's always like someone sucking dicks or some dick goes in there or you know, whatever. It just becomes a dick joke somewhere or another. I mean, time machine jokes become dick jokes. Just I have a really juvenile sense of humor. And I was like, maybe there's a problem with that. I know. That's what I like. Well maybe I should expand that out. Let me try to like, relax. And then I saw norton and every other job was a dick joke and I fucking how old all the way through.

Speaker 1:          01:54:19       Like it literally every other joke and we had a conversation about it. I go, you like gave me like positive affirmation. Like sometimes I worry that I have too many dick jokes. He goes, oh, I never think about that. Think about that because that's what I think about some of them. Sick fucking person. He's funny, man. He was really funny. It was refreshing. It's good to see, you know, we work all the time. It's like I don't get to see like a, a full headliner set that's like real rare that I get to see someone in a comedy club working and just be an audience member and sit down there. So it was cool man. It was fucking, I was howling. But here's a weird thing, man. There was these two local comics that were watching and the fucking, he was killing. Okay. Norton was fucking killing.

Speaker 1:          01:54:59       And these two guys were watching like this hate or sad faced just totally dead face. And I was like, wow, that's weird. Like, do you don't think this is. I was crying, laughing, you know, at certain points. I mean, it's just really well crafted jokes. Really funny here. This bit about tiger woods, about. I don't, I don't want to do it. I don't want to fuck it up. I don't want to paraphrase it, I don't want to ruin it. But uh, I was crying, I was fucking crying and I looked over. These guys are stone faced haters, haters. Also. They're trying to, they're probably fascinated like it's a big deal to be working with a big name. Jim norton's a big name national act, you know, so then they get to work with them. Then they're judging their own performance against his. Trying to think of there better than his jealousy with comedy, especially the, the,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       the guys, they were like, I could do

Speaker 3:          01:55:45       better than this person. Well there's a lot of guys that are just starting out or they've been doing it for a couple of years that for some reason they feel like your success like takes away from their success and they should have more success when they do look. Very weird thing, man, to be a person that wants to be on stage with their voice amplified in a spotlight on you. You've got to be fucked up. And I'm talking as one of them and I'm talking to two other ones. You guys are both comics, you know, you both do stand up, you know, you've got to be fucking crazy to want to do that. And so a lot of these people, they're like so desperate to even out their life, they're so desperate to finally get some success. So desperate to put it all together and have the big picture in front of them and finally move on past this disaster of a childhood that they, you know, they didn't want to claim ownership of their life. So they get like super hyper ambitious.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       I met people who are like, you know, I hate sand up. I just get up on stage because it's challenging for me, but I hated every second of it. And I'm like, that's strange. Who says that

Speaker 3:          01:56:40       you can be good and say that you have to suck this period. Except steve martin. Steve martin didn't like standing up in the end, you know, he was a, it was too easy for them apparently, and he was awesome. You know, let's get small. That's some fucking great shit. Like I remember when the jerk came out, steve martin was holding

Speaker 2:          01:56:56       various johnson navan sounds like a typical day.

Speaker 3:          01:57:00       Fun shit man. He was a funny, funny comedian man, but he just got too crazy. He would, he would. He was so big that everything he said got laughs and like he lost perspective and like, you know, we stopped doing it. He was so good. He had a stop

Speaker 2:          01:57:17       man. He, he, he, he was such a let down for me because I was such a huge. Steve martin was the letdown. It was just, you know, that that part like around sergeant bilko years where he just kind of lost the part that was funny to me about them. It's like I can't really tell what it is. It's exactly what it is. Just age I guess.

Speaker 3:          01:57:37       So it happens to all of them. It happens to almost everyone. It's very difficult to maintain a sense of humor as first of all, as your body starts to decay and second of all, as you have all these relationship problems, which they always do. No, you just have these fantastic weddings. It turn into bitter divorces and then you wonder, well, this is it. I'm here already and now I'm 45 or something like that and um, I'm a movie star and I'm making all this money and I don't even enjoy myself and I don't even enjoy the product and what is funny anymore. And when you're not doing stand up, when you don't have that immediate, for me at least i would not be confident. And whether or not what I think is funny. I know, I know that I know how to make things funny. I know, I know what things are funny and aren't funny because I do stand up so much.

Speaker 3:          01:58:20       So it's like you become immersed in the language of comedy, but when you're removed from that, completely removed from the idea or the act of creating the comedy and then producing it and putting it on stage and performing it. And then honing it and then sharpening up the bits and, and you learn things from that like, oh, that was way better when I did it this way because I got to it quicker and the people understood it better. You become in the language of company b, you stay good, you stay good. But when they stopped doing comedy, man, he stopped writing comedy and they just sort of like, just acting in movies for awhile. Like you just, you might as well be living on mars motherfucker. You're not even living with people. You're walking around in a plastic bubble and people are getting used to, you know, bagels and lox at the craft service table and you pull it up in a ferrari and complaining, you know, because there's an up knocking it shit, you know, and you go into set and you're getting makeup put on, you know, they're fucking fitting a hairpiece to you to make your hair look big and thick.

Speaker 3:          01:59:11       You know what I mean? That's what it was kind of a weird world is that you're walking down the carpet and then that's your interaction with humans. Your interaction with humans is on the set and people serving you and then your next project and it's always this weird relationship where you're a star and their underlings and they all need to keep you happy to keep their job and so everyone's like super supportive and you don't even know what the fuck is up and what's down. You just drunk all the time. It was fucked up on pills, you know, you know, you don't even know. It's the reason why so many of these guys become completely insane. You know, that, that, that world, the idea of living like that, it's just, you've got to be out of your fucking head. One of the most frustrating things ever when I first moved to hollywood is just dealing with actors. You know, guys who have done it their whole lives and guys who had been involved in the business for decades and she'd be dealing with them and you aren't even fucking real. You know, you just, you're so odd and fake and everybody's fake and everybody accepts that everyone's fake. No one's calling anybody out at any of this and the behavior is so strange. You know, everybody's pompous and

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       she does a lot of extra work and so she's always on sets with like, like she was on set the other day with a was that guy's name the rapper, ll cool j and stuff like that. Did you ever have any crazy stories of working with some of these people? Because this is funny. A ll cool j's walking aRound. I didn't know who it was. One point at ll cool j. Nobody looks like I've only heard him. I never looked at a picture. What was the other thing that you didn't know? That we were talking? He doesn't know a lot of stuff, which is kind of cool. Something yesterday that was really weird.

Speaker 3:          02:00:42       Oh, you didn't know aBout the howard stern show? you didn't know who robin was that there was.

Speaker 2:          02:00:48       That to me is she doesn't know a lot of things like, like you go do you know this tv show? She's like, what cosby show? That doesn't make sense. I Would think it would be able to do.

Speaker 3:          02:00:56       Most people would be able to name who robin quivers was and howard and know that more people would know that. Then know who was president before clinton.

Speaker 2:          02:01:04       Yeah. But you know nowadays howard stern, she's 22. You, she, she missed that big howard stern willing. YeaH, I mean the point. Okay. Because he was on satellite radio when you were like in high school. Right. Okay. That makes sense. Right. Wow. It's still same. Insane. Yeah. So what about. Okay. Anyway, go ahead. L cool. J. So you didn't know who l cool j dot. I didn't know what ll cool j looked like, but someone pointed out to me and he's going up all on set all around like the girls and he's like, hey ladies, how you do in rubbing their shoulders? He's like, hey, yeah, you looking good? What you doing? I'm looking at him this and I'm like, this

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       guy is ridiculous. He's walking around like he owned the place touching all these young girls and they're like, oh, and I'm like, you better not touch me. I'm like, please use your ll cool j credit. Just to be like, hey ladies. I just thought it was like kind of a douchey his thing.

Speaker 1:          02:01:54       But were you hating because he didn't come rub on you? Oh no. WHat am I. A cycle with the girls. Girls not like it. No, the girls were into it. I'm just looking at it. I'm like, that's so unreal. Like he just walking around like if theY liked it, what's the problem? If they liked it and he liked doing it. Yeah. I don't know. It's just, it's odd. You thought that he was gonna do to you. That's why it was weird. No, it's just weird that he does it because he's ll cool j because a regular guy who's not his status wouldn't walk around like. Yeah, right. But he is ll cool j, right? Yeah, that's what she's saying is weird. It's just like a normal person. He's walking up. Is he using that credit? If the girls actually like it, that's where it gets tricky.

Speaker 1:          02:02:33       If they actually like him doing that, is he using it or not even saying that? She's just saying it's weird seeing somebody act like a planner. I don't give a shit. I totally agree with you, but if they like it, is it still weird? Like if, if I saw that, it would be weird if I saw some guy walking around going, hey, what's up baby? It's ooh, gimme kiss, but why would we judge this if we, if he's enjoying it and they're enjoying it. You knoW what I'm saying? It's one thing if you came up to you and you were like, okay, this is fucking. I just came here to work. All right. I don't want to be weirded out by some cultive personality, but that'd be me being prissy. Then that's not you being prissy. You know, I just thought it was someone should not violate your space.

Speaker 1:          02:03:10       like if, if you know, if there was like if you were there or you know, you're dating guy and he's right next to you and your uncle jay did that, that would be disrespectful, right? Yeah, of course. Right. Well that then it's disrespectful. Even if your boyfriend's not there, you're not supposed to go up to someone. Just start touching them. You know, you gotta she's gotta know that you, you know, you like him first or there's got to be some communication going, hey, can I rub your shoulders? You can't just go up and start rubbing people he was doing and he liked it. I liked it. Could be guessed that to like the clinton move and clinton will just pull his dick out on girls' jail. Clinton used to do that. yeah, dude, he did it a bunch of times. They're just hilarious because it's like a frat boy move.

Speaker 1:          02:03:43       Like clinton would be alone with chicks and just pull his dick out and people go, how could he do that? I'll tell you how he could do that because it works. It probably worked 80 percent of the time. You know, it probably worked even more than that. He's fucking bill clinton. If I bet if he felt of thing, he felt the green light, I'm going to go for it. I bet he whipped out his dick and like 80 percent of the time it was a, it was a home run, but it was those, the awkward 20 that would just, it would just crash into the woods, like he misread them or they just got so offended that he would do that, that they just flipped over the other way, you know, whatever the fuck it is. But he would rock that all the time. That's what he would do. And just pull his dick out. What's your hatred of hot chicks? But hold on a second. I'm not finished there. So that's like what ll cool j is doing. He's doing a very mild version of pulling his dick out. He just going for it. Yeah, I guess so. So if you're with a guy, right, and you really attracted the guy and he pulls dick out his

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       dick out and you just go for it. Just be like, what do you think? I am like really into them. If you're really into the guy, it's possible. Right. If you were. If I was to check into it was a perfect situation, the perfect circumstance. The guy pulls his dick out and got to go, what the hell? I think there's a difference though if like really liking ll cool j because he's you a celebrity and liking his rap and then thinking, okay, now he has his dick out. Wait, we're not talking about ll cool j. President is a different story. We're mixing up our metaphors, but I think I totally agree with you. I would think it would be gross too, but if they like it and he likes it, then it's a match made in heaven. Heaven. Well, you know, I mean I bet a lot of girls that come on the show just to meet him.

Speaker 4:          02:05:22       You know ll cool j suck symbol, right? One of those freaky bitches. They'd probably come on shore. They probably act as extras just to be lol. I can't believe he right there. Oh my goodness. It's probably mostly 40 year old women own 30 year old woman. Really young girls going, oh my god, ll cool j. You're crazy. He's a stud. He's 22 years old right here. Built like a linebacker. You might think like, girls think that that's sexy, but I'm like, I see a 45 year old man who's probably married. I don't know, but he just looks like a man. Like he looks. It's not sexy. Ll cool j is sexy, very sexy. He's built. He's got fucking workout books. Was on the cover. Completely shredded. Hating my own theory is starting to become correct. What is the ll cool j theory? I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:06:15       This is the second time we've talked about ll cool j and then you've defended his honor. So I'm thinking, well, I probably wouldn't want to hang out with the dude, but I do. I defend his right to be cocky. Ll cool j pulled it off, you know, plus he's a rapper. Rappers have to be cocky. That's part of the sport. Yeah. I don't know if it's just me. It's attractive to know a guy it like physical fitness, but it's not like hot because they're like muscular bill. That's all. That's all you. Everybody's different. Everybody has different guys like fat chicks, like a big, big fat ones. We have friends. We have to get this one fan. He's not happy and the girls just 30, 40 pounds overweight. He likes it. He likes some gigli and barely hanging onto their clothes for whatever reason. Turns him on and he's a skinny guy to sustain.

Speaker 4:          02:06:59       Hmm. Hmm. I think it's a smell that they give off some certain people just like fuck, like food, right? Like pheromones. Second difference between sweaty butt and thigh and mixed with old hamburgers that turns people on. Yeah. Maybe it's someone. I think it is. Honestly, I think it's your first sexual experience. You know, you have like a really hot sexual experience with a fat girl and you beat your brain becomes imprinted to sexuality. Being attract people is kind of interesting. That means I would like brown hair, girls with big boobs, brown haired girls with big boobs. That was your first. Yeah. Tell us more about you. Do you get that? Do you have like a specific type? No, I don't. Not at all. Not at all. I'm not crazy. Pretty much just what I live for nowadays. Not crazy and not crazy. Yeah. What percentage of girls that you dated had been crazy? Most of them. 90? Yeah. Hmm. Interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:07:58       Do you think girls are crazy, allison, you, you, you, you're around a lot of chicks. Do you think the majority of your friends are to blame and that they are like the crazy person.

Speaker 4:          02:08:09       They'll be like, oh, so I have an issue with my boyfriend, but I think I'm just not going to tell him and see if it will go away without me telling them, but I'm going to act mad and him next time I see him, I'm like, why would you do that? Here's a question. When you're around a bunch of people and you keep having relationships like this over and over and over again where you would crazy people, you have all these problems. How do you stop that? How do you reset and how do you somehow another move forward without all this bullshit in your life? How do you do that?

Speaker 2:          02:08:34       Um, I try to like most, most of my crazy ass bitches. I tried to remain friends with them and have some kind of cool level with them where I, uh, it makes yourself kind of healed that way to think, okay, this person is fucking crazy back. It's still be friends with this crazy bitch, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:08:50       Right. But I'm saying, how do you move forward in your own life and stop this from happening. Stop this pattern from a peanut. How do I stop data? crazy bitches become gay. Obviously starts sucking dick. Ll cool j looked me up. Where you at? Where you at? Girl? That was a sad, sad answer. I think the answer is you don't have an answer right now. No, I don't. I really don't have an answer. I mean, how do you have an answer for that? I mean look at allison psycho. Make eyes over there and she's about to snap. look at her. Are you about to snap some of those, those, uh, uncomfortable moments and the drunk cast, especially the first one when you guys were hanging on each other. I'm like, wow, do you really want this out there? Man? Why? Because you're so silly. It's just like, it felt like dirty.

Speaker 4:          02:09:32       I was like, oh, it's like a lawyer lawyer, but like I was watching two people in a living room hanging out and they were drunk and they were being silly together. Like I felt like I shouldn't be here. That's great. Well, did you have pants on? No, I never have pants on. That's probably what their main reason why you shouldn't be watching us walk around naked, man, bro. I don't want to close friends. I grew up with. I've known him since we were like 10. He says he was watching it and he's like, honestly, I got like kind of uncomfortable feeling as I was watching it. Yeah. a lot of people actually said this, you know why? Because he wants to fuck you. That's what's up. What I mean dude, that dude. Yeah. He got uncomfortable and nobody got uncomfortable because it's just. Some guy was when I was younger and she don't know. You don't know me. I'm just like, I thought you were gay. You thought he was gay. I'd say when we were kids and he has a girlfriend, but he does have a thing for you. Huh? And he said it once and get the fuck out of my room. Oh really? What happened? I'm all high and I'm trying to go to bed and he was living me and he comes

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       from my elbow. Here's your roommate? Yeah, because his parents got kicked out.

Speaker 1:          02:10:37       Do you ever find like loads in your shoes or anything? Like,

Speaker 5:          02:10:40       is that what it was? Know? He comes in my room and he's like, hey allison, sit in my little chair like this next to my bed and I'm like, hey, what's going on? And he's like, so been thinking like if we weren't such good friends I would fuck you. And I was like, get tHe fuck out of my room. Yeah. and that's it. We never brought it back up. I brought it back up like couple of weeks later and I was like, you want to fuck me? And then he's like, no, I don't.

Speaker 1:          02:11:04       Making fun of them saying, oh, what a friend. A confidence booster. Awesome. having prejudice and jump out of a fucking window and I'll never get it. Well, you know, how old was he at the time?

Speaker 5:          02:11:16       Uh, we were 19.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       You don't know what the last year. Eighteen months. Two years ago and many months. Months. Two and a half years. Seventeen hundred days. Not that much. Really. When you think about it, two and a half years ago, you were the same guy when you were like 22 though. It's just fucking world. If you knew me in 22, you'd be so scared of me or two and a half years before that, right? Yeah, we crazy back then. And I was crazier and I was a hippie probably just because I was fucked up. You were talking about earlier we were talking about, um, jersey shore. Like could you imagine if you had a video cameras folloWing you around back when you were at that stage? You know, you'd come off. So douchey. Yeah. Oh my god.

Speaker 5:          02:12:00       Gross. Even when I was 18, I used to think I was invincible. I wanted that whole stage where I'm like, yeah, I don't even wear my seatbelt. All that other bullshit. You don't want to get a motorcycle. Yeah. And then you get out of that stage and you're like, what was I doing? He never been hurt before. I have,

Speaker 1:          02:12:15       I got it. I heard a bunch of times as a kid, so I never had that feeling. I broke my arm when I was six. I snap like snap my forearm and to where it was like hanging off, it was fucking creepy and there was like a big dent in the middle of my forearm and my hand was like the wrong, you know, it was hanging like folded, traumatizing. That was really bad. It was a bad break. Yeah. They didn't have to go play tennis though. They just set it somehow or another.

Speaker 5:          02:12:36       You should hear this car accident. She was in man. Really fucking want to talk about that? About her boYfriend and her wearing a tie. How old were you? I waS 15. Seatbelt or no seat belt and that was in the back seat. Got my best friend, the girl who actually said I wasn't a woman of god. She went crazy from this. What happened real in front of this from this accident?

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       Well, you could have included that when you were telling us how she was. No, it's

Speaker 5:          02:12:59       good because I can relate it. So she's sitting on my right or whatever. My left, my boyfriend at the time is on my right. There's a guy driving and we're going down the road and we're going to go to a haunted house. So he makes like a u turn and winds up hydroplaning. And we hit a tree going like 55 miles an hour. Oh. And I wake up covered in blood and everyone had to pretty much get cut out of the car. And my boyfriend was pronounced dead, but he lived, but it was in a coma for two months. They had brain surgery. All because my cheekbone hit his temple and it slipped, severed an artery and his brain got pushed over to the side and the other kid was pronounced dead but lived. But he's like kind of brain damaged. He's okay now though.

Speaker 5:          02:13:40       And then uh, my best friend who obviously was okay next to me, but she got a concussion and after that she was like, I'm a woman of god. So I, yeah, the next day, um, I'm in the hospital and the guy comes in and he goes, alice and I want to be here if it wasn't bad news, but one of the guys aren't gonna make it through the night. And I was like, oh great. And it was my boyfriend and I is um, like 11th month anniversary that day. So it was like really fucked up. Then I go to the hospital finally to go see him and they are reading him his last rites because they were gonna loan is oregon's out. Wow. But he lived and he was kinda like slow for awhile, but now he's totally fine. He's noT the same person before the accident, but he had still a person have your face on his face. He has a big scar all the way to here and all because like my cheekbone was just like smash god. Damn. Yeah, that was nuts. But hydroplaning scary as fuck man.

Speaker 3:          02:14:34       shitty cars. My first car was a 68, four, four, two, my wife now, my first car, my first car was a [inaudible] 73 chevelle, but my first car that was worth more than $10 was a 68, four, four, two and is a old hot rod and it had a 400 cubic inch engine that was like way too much power for a retard like me, you know, and I was like 16, maybe 17 at the time. And uh, I hydroplaned right in front of my school. I just, I had bald tires. The tires just weren't that good and there was a lot of water on the ground and the car slid sideways and slammed into a fucking telephone pole and a tree broke the car in half. Why haven't you? Nothing. Nothing was fine. And the crazy thing is that me and the two dudes I was driving with, we're fun.

Speaker 3:          02:15:14       We didn't, we weren't going that fast. It was just a shitty car, just fucking old, you know? And it, it, you know, if you hit the tree like that with a new car today, it wouldn't do nearly as much damage. But that car just broken half. It was just kind of old and the frame wasn't good I guess. But I, I had a pretty good. I mean They hit a pretty decent, but I wasn't even going that fast man. It was just, just those old cars, they just, you have no control of them. They suck, man. The break sucked. Oh remember how long it used to take? Oh my god, I had a, a skylark and 1970 skylark. And you'd, you'd have to like, be really careful with the breaks. You'd have to be really careful with stopping like stop way earlier than you think because you're like, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Like every time you stopped it was an ordeal. You know, you like have a new car today, man with disc brakes. Abs and cheerleaders. yeah. Technology rather than technology. Someday they're going to be making fun of people for driving around thinking like you remember when people had to like get in their car and try places. When people have to wake up and go outside to teleport, bro, you're going to be able to teleport you to be able to move

Speaker 5:          02:16:22       like the mailman. When is that going to go out of business very soon. That's fine. Five years.

Speaker 3:          02:16:26       I would say. I still send things, bought things and get things ordered by mail and

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       send. I have to send checks in and stuff. It's going to be so upbeat like unpractical soon. Well, the problem is when you have no paper, you have no fucking. You know, it's like things are getting weirder and weirder. At one point in time, money used to represent gold, right? it used to represent your $100 bills worth $100 worth of gold. well, it doesn't really mean that anymore. now it's like it's just, you just have confidence that this $100 is worth $100. And what happens if a zoologist numbers I'll give. you don't even have paper. You just look. You're constantly looking at computer screens. Those screens are telling you what your numbers are and where are these numbers located? Are they somewhere, are they even fucking real? And then the, the, the, the economy becomes so transparent and so elusive and then it becomes too fucking strange.

Speaker 1:          02:17:12       You know, I think we need, we need some physical form, we need money, you need paper money. We still need that shit. We need something to just cling us to the idea that that money is a real thing, you know, when it all just becomes zeros and ones and zeros and then just people just start jacking each other for the ones and zeros and adding ones and zeros where they don't belong and it's fucking, it's not good man. It's like all the shit that's going down, all the money that goes to Iraq and Afghanistan and how much of it's missing? Like all that. The halliburton scams and scandals. Fucking billions. Billions of dollars missing. Yeah. They don't know where it is. They'll find it. Did something. Then lately, uh, the, uh, the youtube banos organization, red, do you know about all this? It's supposed to be for aids in africa or 66 percent of the money stolen. They don't know where the fucking wet people were stealing from banos and a helping aids organization. People just suck

Speaker 5:          02:18:09       jesus dealings going on over there or around here.

Speaker 1:          02:18:11       Question. I don't think they've isolated it yet. Could have easily been going on in africa. I mean, how can you put it past africa, right? one for you. One for me.

Speaker 5:          02:18:21       A documentary of iberia. How they had to get out of their cars. Like they heard that the guys had money. So the guys who were filming it had to get out.

Speaker 1:          02:18:27       When you're talking about the vice guide to Liberia, we talk about that on the podcast almost every week because it's so fucking crazy. If you havE not seen it, folks, please get it. You said it's on netflix, right? Netflix. Streaming. Yeah. Um, how did we get into this conversation? We're talking about project red. Oh, the, the, the scam. you know, the, the billions of dollars missing this youtube guy. Banos fucking organization. And then the halliburton shit. How much money is missing there? If halliburton was like one guy, they would never be able to get away with that, you know, it was one person. it's like, where's your missing billions? Where is it? Oh no, it's gone. But becAuse of the corporation, you know, it's like you could, you could be missing billions, but the weIrd thing is they get to vote like a person, like in these, they get to use money like a person and make donations like a person, like one of the most recent, one of the most recent findings or supreme court rulings was that corporations have the same rights as an individual so they could donate money.

Speaker 1:          02:19:27       An individual can donate like whatever you want, which is ridiculous. So Vermont is a, the first state to step up and deny that Vermont is the first date and the recently announced that they are not going to allow corporations to behave as a, as a human being and that they're going to judge them in a different way. so it's kind of interesting. You know, It's interesting that one state finally has the balls to step up. You know, Vermont has a weird state. It's always been like real kind of hippie, you know, kinda like ben and jerry's grateful dead fish and it's not that many people up there, you know? Isn't that the way that bob dole, god came from? Not bob dole. The other guy. I'm the guy that got. He was running for president and carry. No, no, no. The guy was running for president and then he screamed too much and they a fucking cunt. You don't know his name

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       trying to search. I'm like searching my brain. Nothing.

Speaker 9:          02:20:16       Uh,

Speaker 1:          02:20:17       I don't remember his name. God dammit. He was a really articulate guy. I'm sure someone on twitter will tell me almost immediately he was a really articulate guy. But uh, for whatever reason he did this one speech where a while he was doing a speech fucking homeboy started yelling just to like, was just like, he excited. Then we're gonna, you know, then we're going to take over New York and I'm going to take over. And it was like at a rally and he didn't realize, you know, that the microphone, you know, when you think you're screaming and yelling, you know, and you think that the sound of the crowd is like a, you're at the same level of this out of the crowd. So you can't even hear your own voIce. Well the microphone right in front of his face. So the microphone is only picking him up so it sounded like extra.

Speaker 1:          02:20:58       Completely crazy. Alright. Someone will tell me on the message board please, because I know you fuckers know whose name is 66 percent of banos money. Howard dean. Thank you sir. Mr. Dennis. And he came up with it. That's the dude's name. Howard dean. I believe he was the um, the governor of Vermont. So it's a, it's a freaky little fucking state. But they stepped up and said the corporations aren't people you fuck heads. Will that help? No, not unless you moved to Vermont. Do want to move to Vermont? No, it's too cold. Vermont now my friend shane lived at night and there was points where it was snowing so bad that he had to like drive through tunnels. just, you know, like they had done. he was stuck at his house for weeks at times. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's normal. Fuck that. vermont's no joke. You can't be traveling on the road as much as we do in live with romana. So that's out. There was one other thing that I want to talk about before we get out of here, but I don't remember what it is. Um, got anything brian?

Speaker 9:          02:21:55       Um,

Speaker 2:          02:21:57       yeah. And she goes here. Yeah. I think I already told you. But flavor flave has a new chicken. He selling chicken now and uh, it's hilarious. It's got flavor. Flavor's fried chicken and it's in I believe Iowa. And if you to google it, google is search that and just look at the advertising for it to this one. It doesn't even look like flavor flavor, flavor. Flavor is fried chicken mixed with chicken wings. There's a lot people love chicken and Iowa.

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       Hilarious stuff. Flavor flavor is one of those dudes just always going to kind of be around. Yeah. No. Yeah, mean you don't hear about chuck d anymore? You never hear about professor griff. You don't hear about other members? Yeah. You know terminator x, terminator x bro. I don't know. I don't know. But fLavor flave. Did you watch the flavor flavor show were uh, they were trying to get them a girlfriend and the one girl who shit on the stairs. Yes. That was so fucking. I see that. I didn't say that. But brian, her what happened? She passed out and she showed it on the stairs or something like that. Something like that. Another she shit and it wound up on stairs or she. Yeah. fuck was that. I think she was walking up the stairs and shit. Her pants fell out on thIs. Did he keep her on the show? Oh, I don't know. But I mean come on. What? What kind of human is just shitting themselves around dropping logs out of their parents. I want to wish. Hope that's completely real to stone director. Like, dude, just put a little poop coming out.

Speaker 5:          02:23:23       He had all the girls make chicken and see what make the best chicken and then he this one lady surgeon and he's like, are you serious? Is this an even copd? I can't believe you'd serve those. Can you fucked it up?

Speaker 1:          02:23:33       well, that's unfortunate. Kicked her off. Some people aren't that good at making chicken. The reality shows don't have to make things up, man. Those shows, they don't have to. You know, shows like jersey shore. You don't have to. There's enough craziness out there. Teen moms, they don't have to. You don't have to make something though.

Speaker 5:          02:23:51       That's like I auditioned for that ww ii divas thing and then I didn't really know what it was all about and she tells me I did. When was this last week in the house? She was like, oh, it's a show. Yeah, I guess like you get in the house and then you do all these competitive type things where you battle for like a wwe diva where you do like interviews and fights sometimes. The girl was like, you're almost perfect for this spot, dah, dah, dah. And I was like, sweet. And then I was thinking about it and I'm like, oh, it's going to be six weeks of filming and they're gonna. It's gonna be crazy. Reality show. Probably if it did work out. Alright. so what does that mean? I would never want to be in a house for six weeks. I would never do those reality show. But when you're 22, I liked taking opportunities that sound like kind of crazy. so I actually would probably.

Speaker 1:          02:24:34       So you're going to do it even be a pro wrestler. You know what? Some day when you're a big name pro wrestling, you're on tv and you're battling will say we called it here first when you're like a, like an interviewer and then you get drawn into the fight, right? That's what's going to happen. Right? So if they want. Yeah, I think it's a good move.

Speaker 5:          02:24:49       I would say do it. I think it sounds fun. Flicks here. My neck. You know your, your, how you can flex your time. You will be able to see on the shirt.

Speaker 1:          02:24:57       Well you flex your boobs. Pec muscles. Oh, okay. That's creepy. She just raises each one. But she's getting you to work out with you guys were hanging out.

Speaker 5:          02:25:05       You're going to get a gym pass. I can physically train you. She's a physical training. Powerful alpha male. Female. Well, no I wouldn't. We could just run together. No,
