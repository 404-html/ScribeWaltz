Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two. Wow. And we're live. Today is uh, Wednesday, November first, which means sober. October is over. I have saved my indulgence to be here with you on Benjamin. It's such an honor. We're going to drink some, uh, William Wolff. Bourbon. It's perfect. Not sure where I got this. I believe somebody gave it to me. I hope it's not poisoned. Got Trust the wealth. I have a little list that will spark up a dube or it is the party started. Cheers, brother. Grandson, October man. Thank you. Thank you. I had not sober October. I bet you did. I saw some tweets.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Benjamin likes to go off. I appreciate that. But you know what, man, that's a fucking. That's a last thing. The ability to go off crazy shit. Everybody is so God damn scared of repercussions of being protested. I mean everybody's being hashtag called out. I now and it's just like, it immobilizes people. It's like, that's why like a season to this season of stranger things. You're watching that. I like it. I like hopper, like the cop because he'll get pissed and be like, sorry. It's because I just care so damn much. You could do that shit in the eighties.

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       Oh, sweet taste of marijuana and marijuana and 31 days. All right. Well that's nice. How's it feel? It feels good to be back. It feels good. I missed it. I tell you what though. I enjoyed being sober. Not that I needed to be sober, not like a junkie with the problem, but it's nice to take a reset. I'm going to do it every year. I'm going to do sober October every year. They you heard is good. So gear yourselves up, ladies and gentlemen. Eleven months from now. Join on in. Maybe. Maybe all in won't. What do you think? Oh No, I'm in man. Let's do it. I'll do sober October because this year I uh, I just hit my foot with an ax. He such a. you're so are living in the boonies men. I don't know anybody in La that good. Tell me that. Where I wouldn't call the police and say, uh, I don't know why the fuck he swinging an ax but feet checked.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Well yeah, because my brother does tree work so I usually wear the good the boots, you know, but, but I, we, we fire, we have fires every uh, every night and I really liked tinkering to make the fire good. And then I cracked some beers and then my family hangs out and then they go inside and a crack more beers and I de chops more wood and uh, I didn't put on the good boots and uh, my ax just careened off off and hit me in the foot. So. And I didn't, uh, I didn't have time to, to get stitches, so I just put a maxi pad on it and it worked. How big was the cut? Is Pretty legit. They say you should use, um, whenever possible. If you can't get anywhere you can use crazy. I've

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       never tried that, but I know a lot of people who have. And I know fighters who've gotten cut in camp and just use crazy glue krazy glued up to the cut and then made it to the fight. That's awesome. Didn't let anybody know that they had a preexisting injury. Those guys are hard as nails. There's a lot of them that they'll go into the octagon with some crazy shit. What is this fleet? What happened to him? Flee plays doctor with superglue. Oh, most people cut themselves. Bally had the emergency room, but when red hot chili peppers basis flea, cut his thumb open, aggressively strumming his guitar during a show. He didn't have time for surgery, so keeping it crafty, picked up bottle, superglue, seal that cut like any good shirtless rockstar would. Yeah, I would do that in a heartbeat. Like like cuts or wounds. I'm all about just like doing shit like that. It's like broken bones. Yeah. That's when I. I know I've got to set it or so. Yeah, that seems like a flea move. He seems like a psycho. It was just pulled it out of his sock guy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:57       I remember they did an article once he was talking about is how important is pre-performance shits are, and I was like, yeah, they are important, but why is everybody? Why are we ashamed of a bowel movements? Why we shamed a potty? I don't know. Maybe we should be honored to get rid of toxins. Jamie and I were talking about it openly because you got some new bathrooms for the studio that have those Japanese toilets at shoot hot water up your butt. Oh yeah. And they're warm. So you sit in the toilet. It's heated like right away. It's like a warm, comforting, like come in, come in and shit. Come in and just release. Relax those bowels and let it go. Let it go. That's awesome man. I'm, I'm real meat and potatoes with my shifts. I just, I get in and get out, but you know if there's another level to it, like what you're describing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:38       I want an. Sometimes I'm disturbed though after it shoots hot water up my ass for five minutes and then I use toilet paper and wipe it down and it's still. I see poop. I'm like, well what the hell? I haven't had any of those yet. It's been all clean every time I'd be louder than mine. Is there like a lot of water? Is it like you can move it around, you can like five different conditions. It can spread wider general, or is it like, oh, it's just right. It's just perfect. It shoots all over the place. You could get it to go all over the place. I forget. Desires have more than one. A can an aim to more than one spot. Like with a button. Yeah, yeah, you can move it, but it's the fact yet. Right. But then there's also a friendship which is obvious, so women, but for know where that fits.

Speaker 2:          00:05:22       Hammer your boss or you can do a ball shot. I saw some dude on TV. It got hit no on the Internet. Rather a video clip of someone who he the guy in front of, he was a catcher and the guy in front of him just barely clipped the ball and it Corinne to perfectly and it was nuts. Can you see this fast ball? As hard as Paul just targeted his nut sack bang. And even though it's a like an animated gift, it's only a couple seconds long and as soon as that ball hits the ground, you see his body just given like, oh, it was like precision. Like I played lacrosse and that once. Oh this is that it. No.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Well I should have said I should have retweeted. That was being selfish with it. You're being selfish with the ball hit. No. Sometimes I don't read tweak things even though they're good and then I go, why didn't I retweet that? And then I killed, try, go back and find them and they just lost the sea of replies at replies where they just get, I can't. Here it is. I think this is it. Yeah, that's it. Watch this and that might have them go down. Oh see Bam. I mean it doesn't get any more perfect because it hits side Dick. See if you get hit with. Today's cups are so much better than the cups we had when we were kids because the cups we had. If you played. Did you play any contact sports? Lacrosse. So when they have to put those cups in the jock strap, those fuckers kind of floated around a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:06:43       Oh, they were a terrible where one half the time I can Lacrosse I stopped wearing a cup because it was because I would just. They would just start hurting my balls, like that little line part of that, like the edge would sometimes just get above the ball and then one time I got hit by like a 90 mile, an hour shot and the ball goes 90 miles an hour. Yeah. And it's just hard rubber. Ninety miles. I did. I use those things for massage. Uh, they're crazy. Yeah. He would take one of those Lacrosse Paul's, you lie on your back folks, if anybody, if you have like, back soreness and like, especially if you don't want to pay someone to massage you, if you can take the pain, you can do it yourself. Take a Lacrosse ball or we have those other balls. Uh, they, what do they mean?

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       Who makes them row? Yes. Rogue makes some rogue. Athletics makes them, they're fucking awesome. They're called um, a wad. Supernovas Jamie. Go grab one of those. We've got it like right outside the door. Do you know what that thing is? How do these guys can throw like 1:20 right there out of their mind? Oh, it's, it's psychotic because it got the leverage of it. And it's also a sport where you get super good at and then what you don't even have a fucking career until if that guy. I mean there's guys that are probably like just fucking aces at that shit, but they can't go into the nfl, nhl or the. I mean there's nothing. There was nothing now there Jamie. Anyway, so they make them. I think Kelly started invented it, but they, I'm sorry if you, if that's not correct, but they uh, I know Kelly star, it was the one of the first guys to suggest using a Lacrosse ball and you take this lacrosse ball, that's the Wad Supernova, but you can use a cross ball.

Speaker 3:          00:08:21       I use one all the time. I take it with me on the road because it's super little. But you take one of those hard little fuckers and just lay it on the ground and then bridge over it like a wrestling bridge. Just put all your weight into that recall ball and just roll it up and down like any kind of not you have in your bag as painful as fuck. I need some backstabbing. Like that's the six, seven back is not fun after a certain age just starts. Baxter, temporary. They're like tires. You could wear those fuckers out. You have to be careful and you have to do maintenance work like backs or like one of the most

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       common things that people enjoy and it changed their life. Like if you hurt your hand it sucks, but it probably isn't going to change your life like a back thing. Will he break your hand if you've ever broken a hand? It's weird. I broke my arm once. I remember I was a little kid and I had an a cast and I was like, God, I didn't learn how to write with my left hand and it really sunk in my head for strokes. If you, if you're ambidextrous, it lowers your chances of having a stroke. Really? Yes. My uh, my uh, uncles and anesthetists or anesthesiologists and he was like, dude, just write your name with your left hand a lot. And he said that there's something about that that keeps the neuroplasticity better. Is it only writing your name is only writing or other things as well?

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       I think it's just having the skill hand switch. Yeah. That's funny you say that because they say that that's one of the best ways to get good at a skill is to practice it with your opposite side. Interesting. Yeah. Like um, they say that with striking that when you learn how to strike, say like if you stand orthodox means your left hand is Ford. When I say striking him in martial arts, when you stand with your left hand forward, usually guys do that because there are powerful and the right hand. But if they switched it, like if you're a right handed person and you put the power, the backhand in the left side, it comes out super awkward to me. To this day I've been doing martial arts most of my life and my left hand is just straight dog shit.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       Throw a left out of the bag. It looks so awkward and Clunky, but my right hand is pretty stout. I thought. Yeah, for piano, it's like that with the melody and the guy tried to play songs with melodies on the lefthand and it's so hard that I have to almost relearn piano I would imagine. Yeah. I mean because like you're thinking in a language, right? You just don't think it's all I played since I was so young and it's so fast that you can't possibly think. And so then like sometimes I'll forget the way, like a box songs going and it's almost like that south park with Cartman, like you have to start from the beginning. Yeah. Because I don't know how to just jump in because I don't, it's just, it's just instinct. I don't even know what I'm doing. Well, you're the only.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       The only argument for keeping the piano on stage at the Improv. And Craig Robinson for Craig Robinson, sometimes it brings keyboards with them places. That's a good point. You're not really, uh, bring a keyboard on the road. Guy. Aria. I, if they don't have a piano, no, usually they provide it, but every now and then they just won't. They're like, they just forget one when you're in town or how do you, how do you work at like the Improv and funny bones usually do that, but if I'm doing like an obscure club, they'll be like, well, it's a contract, you know, and uh, and I don't mind because I just, I usually go to like best buy or something and then I'll either return it or give it to a kid or something. It's funny when someone just doesn't honor a contract. I had a guy once a week for it. Yeah. I had a club once and like specifically we laid out that everyone has to have a seat. You can have standing room like in the back of this place. And he was like, well then you're going to make less money. I'm like, that's okay because this way at least I know the show will be good. Like I've, I went to see doug's. Dan helped me in a couple of friends and uh, it was at a place where I had to stand long

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       time ago and I remember going, Oh, this blows right? Like, this isn't even half as good as sitting down. It's terrible. So from then on, like I used to go to, um, house of Blues, those are infamous for it. They'd have a big seating area in the front and then to the side they have this open bar area and you would just go on stage talking at a bar. I mean it was like people were just talking. It's like they're moving, they're standing, look, and you can do that by the way. You can get into that road gig mentality and go up there, but it's a different thing. The road gig mentality. You've got to be prepared for the road gig. Yeah. You have to be prepared for not getting crowd consent. Yes. You know, and I, and I, I like a lot of crowd can set where I'm like, listen, you gotta kiss back or we can't do Doggie.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       You also have to be willing to. You have to understand that there's going to be like randoms. John, you want a beer? You want a shot? Totally hear that. You're going to hear that in the middle of punchlines setups. If there's anything that requires quiet, like there's any like weird bit, we have like a long pause, like throw that bit out nuance that ain't going to work, but you could do it. But anyway, this guy, um, he just said, well, I could sell more tickets this way. I got there and we make this work workout, right? Signed the contracts the whole deal. I get there. People are standing. I mean, like a hundreds of people. And I go, what the fuck dude? And he goes, well, you know, when Blah, blah, blah, please here. You know, she always loves people. Stand in the back. I go, what does that mean?

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       We have a contract. I go, you know, we had a contract, right? And he just looks at me and I go, come on man. What the cause is excused. He's like, he just looked at me. He's like, we're here. We're doing this show. This is what we did. I sold extra tickets. I fucked you. You mother fucker. You was like, I'm not motivated by the same shit as human. I want the audience to have a good experience. You just want more cash. There was still made plenty of money. We're still, we're talking about the difference between like, I think it was like 300 to 500 seats, so 300 seeds, seeding or you could do 500 years, 200 standing. But they filled the whole back of this era because he had a big bar area, like a big long area and that whole back area too.

Speaker 3:          00:14:00       To me it's mostly a place they have bands right now. So I've eaten shit with a standing only because I wasn't, I didn't make the adjustment pre show, you know, so in my mind I'm like I'm doing standup comedy and I go out there and I'm like I should be a pink floyd cover band tonight. Who wants to hear the wall? You've got to have a different kind of energy. You have like almost like a carnival barker energy. You know what I mean? Like you got to get those people interested in paying attention. Yeah. Like when I was at a renaissance fair heckler in high school, that was my job, like in the stock and people would pay money to throw tomatoes at me. So it was all just figuring out what someone's vulnerability was and just exploiting it and just, it was carnival barking too.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       I was working with only the guy's name was boob and he was a, a boob full name who you go, I think. And he was a, uh, just gypsies, Gypsies, and I was just trying to beat the joust and I get big crowds because it was all about letting them win occasionally because you couldn't just be like, oh, that tomato didn't hurt. You have to be humiliated. Right, right, right. Even play it up. Right. Did I get hammered and let him slap me in the face for like 20 bucks, 17 I drink, meet and just be out. Did you get hurt that way? I know dude knows how to slap good. Well, there was this one levels, that slap game, but there was a. yeah, like there'd be like a biker. It'd be like, no, I'm gonna throw a rock. And I'm like, Shit. And I'd run to the cornfield.

Speaker 3:          00:15:21       Oh, let's talk to some people did knock you the fuck out with a slop. We use lab. It'd be like just some Dick. And you never know who that dickhead. That's true. That's true. That's super. Like the Diaz brothers. Like you're like, oh, you're a normal guy. Oh, you're the toughest dude in the world. Yeah. You do not want them slapping you. Right. Especially if they know they're going to slap you. It sounded like an instinct. Like in the middle you said something stupid to them. They're like, what? They line up. But if they like line up and get ready, what is this guy doing? He's letting the guy slap him, but they haven't got a slap off. Come on. These go are pretty big on the Internet. Oh my God. Everyone gets knocked out. People get knocked the fuck out. That guy just got kod because this guy hit him right on the job. Oh wait a minute. So who went the gift that that was? This was first I come in and. And so the second, the second guy killed them. That's even more impressive. He took a shot. Watch this.

Speaker 4:          00:16:14       Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       That dude's out fucking cold. I hope there was a mat behind him or someone to catch him. Probably not

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       less drama, just because it's the little button and you know, it still shakes the brain. Yeah, that's terrible. Like that guy's brain got jolted there. His next spun around. His brain sloshed back and forth and said, I'm so screwed. I'm going to get all that shit when I'm older from the tomatoes. You probably will a little for real tomatoes. Do you think hit you $10,000 a day pool? Oh No. They miss a lot that somebody was thrown. I was hit hard maybe, but I never got knocked out. I want to talk to you about this. Do you think that that might have something to do with why you're impulsive? You're very impulsive. I think. Wait a good way. I think you're serious, but you, you, you, what? You say some shit online on twitter. You're fucking super impulsive. Like I laugh at him. I'm like, this dude just goes for it. I don't know about. I, I think, uh, it's just like the art of, I don't know, there is an art to saying fucked up shit and that's one of the things I really appreciate you about you. So you're a very smart guy, but you also appreciate the art of saying fucked up shit. It's one of the things that we do and it doesn't, it doesn't get respected enough because especially today, man, you are fucking dancing a fine line between razor blades and crocodiles.

Speaker 3:          00:17:38       You offend today. People are just super, Super Cali Audi because I just got a bull horn sometimes. I just felt like, I dunno, I just wanted, I just wanted to keep

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       comedy going mad for myself. I didn't want to. I just think our job is to not have a line, you know, I try to be kind, I don't want to like. But at the same time it's like I have to figure like our job is hyperbole. Like we work in a truth dungeon and it's like my, my, my thing is I might be wrong, but I'm not lying and I'm wrong a lot. But in the moment, yeah, I think what's super important is that you. You've made a real good distinction that you try not to be cruel and. Exactly. That's I do too. And sometimes you miss. Right? That's another thing about this working without a net shit boy. Sometimes you miss for sure, for sure. Something you shouldn't have said, especially in live shows you try, you just the impulse comes into your mind and you go for it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       But under careful consideration, if you sat down and thought about it for a few minutes, you're like, oh no, I can't do this bit this and that would have people misconstrue. What if someone took it out of context would. If someone doesn't understand that this is what I'm doing, I'm just pushing buttons to people who know him pushing buttons. I'm not trying to be cruel. They're in the game versus just random casualties. And also I think that the outrage Ponzi scheme people, I don't even. I don't even care. Like I think a lot of people feign outrage because they don't understand, but they still want to retain power. But then there's people that actually like, I'll hurt them and that's when I'm like, oh no, did I? Because my problem is every now and then I'll reverse virtue signaling where it's almost like I'll go farther intense that I normally would have because I'm trying to counteract virtue signaling and then I'm like, well I'm throwing a punch at someone that other people don't even might not see.

Speaker 1:          00:19:22       And then now I just am a crazy guy. Like super aggressive. Yeah, I've been talking about that a lot about trump that I think that all these people attacking trump in many ways, they actually kind of ramp up as behavior for the. Yeah, it's the, it's the if you read up black redneck white liberal by Thomas Soul. No, it's unbelievable. We bring this up, the law. Why do I feel maybe I think someone else did well. Cowen recommended it to me. It might have been so, uh, is like one of the most read. Well read guys. It's unreal. He's just always reading books. Yeah. And he's getting into wine, which is one of the hardest hobbies. I can't do that. I can't even, there's not enough time just to, so like pbr shit, my foot fucking axe. But uh, I can't. A PBR has a wonderful flavor of it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       So I love keeping. If pbr was like really respected as some like light ale from like Germany, like if you've got a good batch of Pbi, like wow, it's kind of weird, sort of aluminum me taste. It sounds like. It's just like they do like the condescending for Annunciation. Like they know Mr. Listen, pabst blue ribbon with some fucking stone crabs and some butter and maybe some fries with a lot of salt on them. Come on son. There's nothing better. I mean look, it's not the same kind of beer. It's people are flavor snobs. Like they want you to be in the IPA. The IPA is, can you handle the bitter? What about caviar? And she like to like stuff that tastes like shit. And they used to feed lobsters to prisoners, like not that long. Well

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Dude, lobsters, God damn delicious, delicious. But it's like, who gets to make the call? Well, you know what the difference is? Lobsters with and without butter. That's the difference was dealt with butter and lobster. This like butter, make some shit just way better. And one of the things that makes way better as lobster for sure there is no god damn question. And lobsters are, you know, it's essentially a bug. It's a big old bug. It's a giant Pete on this shit. Eating beetle. They're not much different than bugs that walk around on the surface of the earth. They're just water bugs. And I think we also liked the task of like cracking and splitting it like artichokes. Tape deliciousness right there. Crabs. What kind of grabs those? Jamie? Look, God damn good stipend. Pbr and crabs and that's it. A pabst blue ribbon can because nothing gets crabs that spice on the outside and lemon and Ipa can take you for a turn.

Speaker 2:          00:21:47       Like my wife. This like here have some odd because I usually come in like if I, if I get a little buys, I'll come in, you know, and she wanted to hang and I'm out there just drinking the, staring into a fire. And she gave me this ipa called dog fish and it's 18 percent alcohol and like three beers and I'm like blacked out because I was just drinking. I'm like, Beers. And I'm like, Oh, three beers now come in. That's so unnecessary. And it was like to do that to people. I don't know. It was like, it's like spike and someone. I was like, roofing, please. Here's the thing. Like, it's you can't. This is one of my. I had a bit about this, about my problem and pot gummy bears. He said, one of the problems is it looks like a regular fucking gummy bear in my brain.

Speaker 2:          00:22:26       Thinks, oh, I could just fucking beat the shit out of those gummy bears. I getting five or 10 of them. False representation could just Jack your world. There's a video I put on instagram of Least Siad. Have you seen that video? One by one design, put it up and he's got a, a video that they took from Joey d as the Church of what's happening now. And Lisa is literally the physical example that you would use if someone who's too high. What's too hot? You like this? This is too high. Like look at him there. He's got his eyes closed. Give me some volume, Jamie.

Speaker 3:          00:22:59       We're all talking. They're playing some music and look at him. Look at him. Look at his eyes. Fade new now. By the way, he knew what he was supposed to be at the podcast, not woke them up to do a podcast. He left the camera on himself to himself and he's just. He's so paranoid right now. He's freaking the fuck out. He throws his head back. He said, Jesus, I can't do this anymore. I can't work. I can't work with you. Joey Diaz. He's just thinking right now. Demons just waiting for him to close his eyes and go to sleep. I can't. I can't keep into the demons over him. Just scratching at the ceiling, just waiting for the lights to turn out and his eyes closed and they're going to go through his fucking mouth. Penetrate his body. And I've been that exact guy on

Speaker 5:          00:23:45       that exact podcast. Yeah, Joe, I couldn't handle it, man. He's a different animal. I love that dude. He's the best, but he's a different animal. You can, you know, don't, don't try to outdo him ever. I was just trying to hang. He was the one who had mercy on me, which I thought was incredible because I'm like, Yo, let me just grab another little stores done, and he's like, no way doc. You're going to fucking be nice to you. Put like what you said about the gummy bears. It's like, yeah, it's almost like the false representation is the thing I don't like more than the representation. That's enough and that's why I get so pissed about certain scandals because someone's a hypocrite versus other ones where I'm like, ah man, I feel bad for that guy. Right. I know what you're saying. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:24:28       In did you see the hear the podcast I had the other day with Jamie Kilstein? Yes. He's a good dude, man. The way he came clean about all that stuff and just talked about how it all got away from him as like a social justice warrior and describing in like really honest and I think super brave the way he described like this charge that he would get after going after someone and calling someone a racist and getting other people to go after and trying to get them fired

Speaker 5:          00:24:53       to gave me a good perspective on myself. It's like when did the concept of the attack dog where it's this like an understood thing where you're going to attack for the group and then it's like then you start seeking approval from strangers and how much of it is actually your own opinion at that point. And that's a very, very profound thing to think about.

Speaker 6:          00:25:10       We, we have a series in our brain is filled with the series of reward systems that are in place, right? Like there's, there's a need for approval from the tribe. There's the need for, you know, sexually reproduce. There's the need to accomplish tasks, has a need to avoid probation, and we have all these reward systems, right? Where like your body and your, your, your organism will reward you with a positive feeling for reinforcing some of the patterns of behavior that are necessary for survival. Right? Like the ability to run away from something when you're scared, when you get scared and you freak out that as a jolt of Goji juice, right? You'll buy that Geico insurance. Fuck you ready to run man. Have you ever been like legitimately scared for your life and have that feeling? Fuck yeah man, it's terrible.

Speaker 5:          00:25:58       Fine. Right? And that's more powerful than, than desire. And I think that's one thing we're facing right now as a society because it's just planes of Africa running from a lion versus towards a banana. Like what's, what's crazier? So I think that that's a way to supercharge a population into buying a bunch of dumb shit.

Speaker 6:          00:26:15       Well, I still think this is a very important point that I think a lot of us it takes a long time to realize is that these reward systems that we have set up, right? Like these patterns that feel good to follow through with like you know, the way we handle conflict and especially at the d, the need to push yourself and stress yourself out like some sort of physical exercise. I've really feel like that those things like if you can help them, like if you could give them their fuel and a positive way, you don't get any of the negative aspects of it, but you get the positive aspects of it because like especially like the physical one, I, I really believe this from my own experiences. We all have physical requirements for movement and we don't. We don't give those physical requirements. We don't feed the body correctly with those movements.

Speaker 6:          00:27:10       And what happens is it gets angst and it gets weird. Everybody gets freaked out and it starts getting fat. It starts feeling like shit. And one of the reasons why it's not functioning right, it's because we didn't properly manage movement, like making sure your body is getting exercise, like put some stress on it so that it can recover and be stronger and maintain a certain level of strength. Because if you don't put any stress on it, it stops working and if it stops working, you start your. You start sagging and deteriorating. And here's the big one. Maybe you're an intellectual. Maybe you don't want to have anything to do with physical stuff because you don't think you think of it as a base thing. That fucking body has a giant influence on your mind. Eight apps, no separation. There's no separation. It is, and it is just a discipline issue and there's nothing else. It's. I'm not saying it should be a bodybuilder. I'm not saying you should go out there and fucking run marathons or do anything. Even the super stressful, but do some sit ups, do some pushups, do some chin ups. If you can do some, some running up hills, pickup some heavy stuff. Move it around and do it regularly. Do it all the time. And do it even if you have no desire whatsoever to look good naked, just do it to make your body last longer.

Speaker 1:          00:28:22       Yes. It's natural anti depressant. Like I used to live in the Czech Republic and there was no gems there. What we do in there studying history and there is no jams and I would have like a. I didn't feel safe in certain areas, jogging because it was just intense so I would just jump up and down. That's it. I would play like disco or something and just manically jump up and down and I feel awesome. I had this dumb idea once a few years back. I was like, well, if you just jumped all the time and you kept jumping, wouldn't you get better at trumping like wouldn't you? Like you get stronger and stuff. It's a matter of like how many reps you do. You don't like. How high could you wind up jumping? Is there a point of no return? Dude? You're telling to a six slash seven guy who can't dunk, who's jumped a lot to try and get up there.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       I think I can get really good at long distance running, but I don't have the twitch to go up and I've tried man. Well I feel like a cement potato. I can't jump at all. I can't dunk for shit. Married little ups. I could endure some video yesterday of the highest jump I've ever seen by a guy that didn't look that tall. His top of his head. You know, the, the verticals thing. He had the top one that's unreal. Like mosquito eggs and spoke video. Yeah, I've saw this one dude that was practicing on those. You ever see those? Uh, the Plyo bags, they're the

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       plyo boxes, but the top of them is like a very soft foam mushy. So they. Yeah, this guy was jumping those and it, it looked like there was like, there was wires attached to his hips. I'm like, what are they doing? A yanking him up to this guy because he was jumping like six feet straight up in the air and landing on this things. It's like, wait a minute, you can, people can do that. It's like you have jumped privilege. Oh look at this guy. Whoa,

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       that must feel so awesome. That guy is. That's a four foot vertical, right? Is that a forefoot vertical? Not sure I don't. I don't know the exact height of the top of the backboard. Know the highest vertical than anybody's ever jumped. If you had to guess, let's take 51 inches. That's a good guess. I'll say 53 just for the fuck of it, but just based on your guests being really good and awesome thing you do for people is you motivate people to learn new shit, which is crucial for a neuroplasticity. I'm very happy that I do that, but I only do it because I'm interested in it myself. Dude, you got me into shoe. I'm like, yeah, God, look at this dude. Sixty. So you got it. You got it bro. Goddamn Leo. Now Marshall, he's a Cuban professional volleyball player and it said to have a 50 inch vertical jump.

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       The next guy is a. The doors Yanni. He's a professional dunker with slam nation did not exist and is set to hold the world record in the vertical at 60 inches. Okay. Here's what I don't like is said is said is used twice. It's like legend has it that. See there's some shitty journalism or you're not telling me the truth. You're just telling me some rumor bullshit. Here's a matter of getting it on on tape. I guess. Here's a 63 or whatever the fuck it is, man. I don't. Don't diminish this man's accomplished or not, but I got up. Jamie got this. I know what you want to see this guy do it. Hold on. I will see this guy do it is insane.

Speaker 3:          00:31:34       He's really gonna. Jump that high. That's over his head out 63 inches. That's fucking dude. You know, you know you're good at something when you're. When you're like, you have a crowd for like a gym movement. Here he goes, oh my God. Oh my God. That's fucking insane. What's that dude's name? Ryan Moodie or is he? No, Evan Unger. 60 three point five inch box. Jump. World record. Hold on, go back please. May Thirteenth, 2016. That dude's a beast. That's ridiculous. By the way, to put that energy into something positive. Son. Just jumping up on rubber tires, being the CEO of a billion dollar company kid, he gets some serious focus. Said you're putting your all your interest on jumping high. It's like a cross. It's a cross. Everyone jump highest. Okay. You did it. You've proven now move forth and you know there's no struggle. There's no pro and box jumping goes back.

Speaker 3:          00:32:30       Yeah, but you said it goes back to the cross. Look man, you're talking to a dude who spent most of his young days doing taekwondo. There's very few things. Do you. Have you got that to us? Kicked Torque? Yeah, but I'm saying like as far as like putting your energy into something that you could do with your life. Right? I'll do. That was a history major. I'm the guy that I have is like conduit Constantine. I get more drinks. Like what? The House that get me. I always loved those guys at the bar that know way more than me. Like what? Hold on. What book? It was always like some obscure bartender who could tell you some crazy shit about Napoleon. You're like, wait a minute. Like we were talking about Napoleon before, like Napoleon wasn't short, he was short for today, but he's a, he's an inch shorter than me, is five slash seven, which is very tall for a person who is starving to death.

Speaker 3:          00:33:16       Right, right, right. Everybody was back then, like nobody got good food. It was like North Korea is now. It's like South Korea and North Korea. The height difference is massive. It's so sad, man. You know, all those little people from like the civil war days, civil war days, an average man was like 130 pounds. The really little tiny fellows. Yeah. You see the uniforms and like a museum and it just looks like smurfs. Yeah man. You know, that's all. It's all just about food. Is it both me up nutrients, you know, it's, it's a dark thing to think of that. This is cheers my brother. Just man. Thanks for having me. Thank you. Thanks for being a fan said dark thing to think that like nutrients held back like the physical development of people. Like they had so little food that they weren't growing. Right. That's so crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:34:02       It's not like they were, you know, like there was supposed to be that small, oh my God, this guy's a giant. Leave comments soldier a look at this. According to historian bell, I Wiley who pioneered the study of the civil war common soldier. The average Yank or reb was a white native born farmer protested single between 18 and 29. He said about five foot eight inches tall and weighed 143 pounds. Okay. That's not as small as I thought because that's average. Now I got like five, five and I think they were saying that the average weight was like 125 pounds with the average height was much smaller. Maybe it wasn't the civil war. It was the war of 18, 12. I think. Civil war, I mean we're on a dollar a day and today's money until like 1890. They were broke, man. I mean my mom, her parents had a dirt floor, dirt.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       My parents were born in America, but my grandparents came over to America from Italy when they were really young. Like I think my grandpa was a before the teenage years and and he was telling me about the brutality of life on a farm when you're poor, during the depression, you know, about how, how we learned to kill rabbits with his bare hands, you know, how you would explain to me a snapper rabbits snack and you're looking in the guy's eyes that didn't know whether or not members of his family would starve to death exactly like this. There was a different world back then. Man. Stakes. Yeah. No one's worried about pronouns. My grandfather was a very kind and gentle man, sort of belied

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       like almost the rest of my family and, and, and his, his start in life because he, you know, he was born during a very, very, very difficult time and he was just a really kind demand who liked to read books. He was like the gentle one of my family. So cool. He was like, I lived with him when I was a kid when I was just moving to New York when I had to leave Boston and I got a manager and my manager lived in New York who I'm still with this day and I was like barely out of the open mic days and um, I couldn't afford to live in New York by myself. I tried to figure it out, like how much money I had, very little saved up and I basically just went to New York with my car and some clothes and my grandpa let me stay at his place.

Speaker 6:          00:36:24       And uh, it was weird man because my grandmother was dying. She had a stroke and they gave her 72 hours and she lived for 12 years. Ice. They thought she was going to be dead. That like you say your goodbyes, get the family to fly to her, you know, she, she had a bad aneurysm and she lived forever. It's crazy. So your grandpa took care of her. He took care of her and I was living with the two of them while that was going on. So like while I was going as transition in my life, like the most exciting thing, like literally that's ever happened to me, I get this real legit manager and I started thinking maybe I can actually do this, like maybe I can actually be a comic because when I was living in Boston I was doing all sorts of other jobs and it was never like a professional.

Speaker 6:          00:37:09       I never had a full. Like I never had enough work where I could 100 percent be a comic and I've only been doing it for like three years. Right. So it was just grinding, constantly grinding, doing a bunch of different day jobs. And so when this opportunity came, I was like, Holy Shit, I can't believe this is real. And as like my life was starting to go into this crazy place, I spent a good solid three months, maybe four living with my grandfather while my grandmother was dying and that's where I live. So I'd come home with them and talk to them all the time. And they lived in a neighborhood that used to be a predominantly Italian American neighborhood in Newark. But it deteriorated slowly but surely until it was like a really. It went from a black people. It's just like they did a thing called blockbusting.

Speaker 6:          00:37:54       You ever heard that story? You know a blog post. They're trying to get them. Yeah, they're trying to. They did that where they would move into neighborhoods and I don't know whether or not it was true or there was doing. They were doing it to capitalize on something that was true or whether they instigated it, but they would essentially go door to door and they would say black people are moving in, sell your house now. And most of my grandparents families around them sold their house. And my grandfather was like, I like black people, fuck off. Literally just shut his door. That's awesome. Man. Grandfather was one of those guys as long as he has a gate and there's a lock on the gate, like everything's good in the world. And he, he had like. So when I would visit him like he had neighbors, like the next door neighbor right

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       next door got arrested for selling crack. This kid had an audi parked in the driveway. They broke through his house with a battering ram. That was like right before I moved in. This is awesome, man. Yeah. But I was watching their transition to death essentially in my transition to life at the same time. Yeah, I'd tell them somewhat similar. I mean that that's to me right now, like, that's so profound because like now that I'm like, I have a family and thinking about my wife and he watched the notebook and you're like, oh shit. But like, my best friend died on my birthday that year. I was out here a snowboarding and it was right as I got like punk and the show punked and he like is the one who got me into standup. And it was like, that was so bittersweet, man. It was like, it was like the fragility of life as you're given this weird ego shot.

Speaker 1:          00:39:26       Just just was like, it was so intense. A good friend of mine died of an overdose. Same thing. Died of an overdose. Like, really? Uh, I can't say I was out here maybe three or four years. He died maybe five at the most. Uh, I spent New Year's Eve, y two k on the phone with him because we were wondering whether or not the world will. Then we were just having fun laughing and then he died. He died of a drug overdose and I found out about it like secondhand. Somebody found out about it through somebody else and they called me up and they asked me if I heard and I said, what happened? Are you sure? And they said, yeah. They found his body in a hotel room and on. Oh, on real rough. It was rough. That was the hardest one next to my grandpa.

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       Those, that was the hardest one. Well, Phil Hartman was pretty God damn hard to. That was a hard one. That was a hard one. I recently lost a, got a heroin. He was a vet and it was like, and you saw it coming, but it was tragic because his ptsd was so bad, but it was like, to. The story was a, he was a d one baseball player at everything going for him. His Dad dies, he wants to join the marines. He's unbelievable at being a sniper, you know, they go through how in Afghanistan he gets on heroin, ends up in my town, we become like best friends with my brother because like a lot of vets want to do tree work because they need that. Every man needs a purpose, you know, and it's like a lack of purpose for like true warrior hero types, his death and so like that extreme nature of climbing up trees and hauling lumber and stuff. We'd all do it together. And, and that's what I also like comedy because the honesty of it, you know, the dude shot tons and tons of people. So it's like that feeling of constant judgment and guilt and pride and guilt. Comedy was like a relief for him and then he just died of heroin man and it was like, you get the this because you know, I got him a gym membership and all this shit and we were all like rooting for him because he's this beautiful man. But like there's just a moral injuries

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       that just can take a toll. And that was, that was brutal. Yeah. There's some injuries of the mind that are probably more devastating injuries to the body, you know, and I think that's uh, that's one of the things that we overlook, what we can't see. We think about what we can see, like, oh, that guy got shot in the shoulder, but we don't look at, Oh, and watch 10 people die in a fire, you know, like, we don't think of that as an injury. But I mean think about like, I've, I've had some friends that were paramedics and they'll tell you like, accents. They roll up on suicides that they roll up on and just after awhile you're like, oh my God, you feel so vulnerable. And one of the things that he said is like, a lot of people that do that work or like a very sexually promiscuous, they just don't give a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       Yeah. And they also want to develop the develop dark humor, gallows humor, you know, like, um, my buddy quinn from the impractical jokers used to be a New York City firefighter. And so we did one of my podcasts together. I mean, we've been friends since my space. I mean, these guys are salted, the earth man, they're the fucking greatest dude's like great statements. Like say we've been friends since my budget. We used to write each other about our sketches and shit and it's like, that dude is seeing just kids torched, you know, and, and he's like, and they had to joke about it. If not, you're going to just blow your brains out. So yeah. And then you come home to your own family, you know? Yeah. It's like, look at England after World War Two. It's like, that's, I think that's what spawned so much great music. Some great art is, you know, you know, their dads all died man and it's like for their cities are getting bombed and out of that comes this like desire to live in the moment and to just be able to say and do whatever the fuck you can before you die.

Speaker 3:          00:43:15       I think you're totally right. I think that's the case with Roman art as well, right? I mean why is there so much artistic expression back then? Why? Why were people so determined to put their emotions down on campus? Those emotions were like hurricane swirling in your brain, visions of people getting cut in half by swords and arrows piercing sternums choking to death on their own blood and fucking hordes of barbarians coming over the top of the hill with the horses, swinging axes like, whoa, that was real shit back then know someone with a blue check mark is mad at me. In fact, then people are just getting their heads chopped off and you know, I've been thinking about this a lot lately with this Kevin Spacey thing is that pedophilia is horrific. We all agree it's. It's terrifying. It's, it's, it's so devastating because as we were talking about before, if someone gets shot, you could see the wound.

Speaker 3:          00:44:12       If someone gets raped by an act or when they're 12 years old, like how do you fix that? Right? What, what is that? What kind of psychic wound is that? And what I was thinking is it's really fascinating to me that we, we pretty much acknowledged that pederasts were commonplace in the 15th century, the Twelfth Century, the 13th century, the 14th century, this way, way into the 18 hundreds. And then when you go with the Catholic Church, I mean it is, if you're a Catholic, you shut your fucking iphone off right now. You know what I'm saying? Nobody raised Catholic and that was as well. Don't get your panties in a bundle. It is a religion built on kid fucking. It is a religion dude. It's all about as a giant history of that and it's because they, they, they wouldn't let the priests have families based on land ownership and some of these moves can take a beautiful religion and make it really dark.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       And there was more than that. It wasn't just that they didn't let him, they didn't want to fuck women because they were a God damn rock stars. The guys who held the Bible and could lead literally read it right? The average person could relax. They're all reading German and all these different languages. I wouldn't. Martin Luther. Have you ever heard the prophets of doom? Yeah. Prophets of doom. Dan Carlin is one of my favorite fucking human beings and several lived and his podcast. Hardcore history is a national treasure. Because I've learned more about history and more about like the mon goals and a World War II and fucking everything, but his podcast on Martin Luther and the trend, the first literal translations of the Bible that regular common folk could read who've lost their minds. They're like, Jesus was poor too. Guys dependent wars killed hundreds of thousands of people.

Speaker 3:          00:46:01       Imagine a world folks were until. What was it like the 15 hundreds? Yeah, mid fifties. It was round Gutenberg, so that was like a 15 hundreds, mid 15 Sinai when Martin Luther was 95 theses in deck, but the bottom line is what he had done was translate the Bible. He Slang. A lot of Dick guarantee wasn't doing this because he just wanted people to be free to October 31st, so. Oh Jesus Christ. It was yesterday. This is crazy. Did. It was after US sober October 500 years ago. By the way. I'm feeling a toasty. I feel so good right now. Filled right back. I was worried, man. I was worried that if I smoked a joint, I'd be like, Oh my God, I'm gonna. Die a worm of paranoia. Thinking about girls, I figured in high school, for me it's the adipose man. I like, I don't smoke every now and that if like there's someone I trust, I know as good we will like Seattle, Seattle's that.

Speaker 3:          00:46:58       I'm like, this is just flesh, but that should make, makes me like real. Um, so this was the 15 hundreds, 15, 15 is I would just a 15, 17. So think about that like before then that we're only talking that we're literally only talking about 500 years ago. Yeah, exactly. That was the last information overload. So think about 500 years in terms of the life of the human species is mere of mere blip and one of the reasons why the Catholic Church was able to get away with just translating things to people where they couldn't read it is because that's how fucking everybody did it. They all did it that way. You would go to some place and some guy would tell you what the sacred stuff would be and you'd be like, okay, cool. Like how many people actually got ahold of it and read it all day and, and studied it.

Speaker 3:          00:47:49       And made sure there was no contradictions is why is this guy keep fucking my wife Jesus. The Catholics were like the buzzfeed. They were banging everybody. I guarantee you they had money. They were allowed to have wives. Like, do you know that like early Pope's ran armies? Oh yeah, I did. They were nuts. They had to go to France for a little while to like, you know, because had so much heat on them because it's what it fused with constantly. It's when a fused with the Roman empire, you got that Empire Shit because Christianity is a beautiful. Religion is more like mellow and peaceful. And, and then you got constantine, you know, the Roman Empire is falling apart and they wanted to get more favor of the people. So they just fuse the two together and they're like, you know, they got, the pope's gone crazy. They ran armies.

Speaker 3:          00:48:36       That was one of the things that happened. Apparently there was a conflict. I hope I'm not fucking this up. It was from hardcore history. There was a conflict where one of the earlier pope's didn't want to send troops to fight gang is con, like there was a lot of confusion in the early days of getting his con because before getting, Goddammit, I've said it in the past, if you heard it in the past, I apologize for repeating myself, but the wrath of Khan, wrath of the con series of Dan Carlin Sunrail streaks on real. One of my favorite pieces of work, whether it's a comedy, a movie, one of my favorite creations ever. It's unreal. It's amazing. It literally changed my life. It's like I got like a Harvard education after paying for a state education for free. I know that in the game and then if you want to get the wrath of the cons, you could just buy it on itunes.

Speaker 3:          00:49:28       It's a dollar a show. That's it. It's so worth it and I think it's like each one of them is at least an hour and a half long. Oh, some are five. The blitz or sick to get all of them. The whole series, right? The series is fine, but not an individual podcast like the uh, recent blitz a was over five about nuclear war and the whole podcast by itself is fine, but yeah, and then he just had the Gothic, a genocide of the gothic Holocaust. I was another fiber. So gangster. And he, by the way, he does this whole himself folks. He edits it all himself. So it was like that dollar is so worth it and in my opinion, he's like one of the most people just don't know. You know, you're not hearing about this on CNN, you not hear about this on Fox News and it is a travesty.

Speaker 3:          00:50:08       It is one of the best ways for you to learn about history because you learn about it. He gives you a broad, detailed sense of the time. He does it in a very entertaining way that you want to keep tuning in and that those memories stick to your brain. There's an art to saying things interesting and he has that old whole series for 10 bucks. It's so worth it. That one and a half beers guys, that's so worth it. Whereas that is website Dan Carlin Doc. Okay. Um, but you can also order it on itunes if you have. I don't have an android phone, but if you have an eye I do, but I don't use it. But if you have an iphone you can order it on itunes and it'll go straight to your podcasts. Yeah. And there's another one that goes to the oster front.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       Mm. Oh. And he also has that old timey voice, almost like the joker where he keeps hitting you. It's like what is a monument of? Yes. He's a great combination of entertainment information and humility. Like he's really humble. He's like, I'm not a historian, but most of us think that the real. And then I'll just the anabaptist clearly when they purged wizard wizard, so, so important. And I mean I've talked about them many times in the past, a point where I backed off because my God talk about 10. Carla too much. That was brian red bands and one who got me into it because I the only podcast I listen to yours like maybe five, four years ago. That was the only one I really had and a and I'm like, Yo Redman, what else should I listen to? It just goes, and I think it was just so fucked up and he still like, it was like that.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       Just, just, just set me off a journey, you know? One another great one is Danieli Lily's history on fire. Listen to that. That's good. Plus you get a fantastic accent. I mean, Danielle, he bullied his, his, his, his accent. He's like, Oh God, like a super Italian accent. I know. I'm like, this is kind of sexy. So much that after this I'm not even gay at all, but this is why people will say, and the Roman gods, because they all talk to each other. We were kind of wig red around that, but it's stunning to me that what we were originally talking about was like how common being a pedophile was. He was like super common. That until there is history on fire profess or about spartacus, spudding kids. He's a beautiful person too. I love that guy. Fucking great dude. Um, but it's, it's amazing how recent it was where that was taboo, where you weren't, where people like, hey, maybe we should stop fucking kids.

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       That's my, that's my one. Like I have a few rules in life, but the number one is don't fuck the kids. Well, it's 100 percent. Number one, don't hurt the children. Don't hurt the children are physically. Don't hurt them sexually. Don't hurt him mentally. Don't hurt the kids. That's number one. Feed. Protect and teach what you are is the result of some crazy shit that happened to you and some awesome shit that happened to you and your ability to manage that fucking the land in between the two that causes depression. Yeah. Between chaos and order.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       Law and order. Yeah. I mean that's what our job is, is to figure out a way to make the best people we can and raise those people so that those people are going to impact as many people as they can in a positive way. And if this can be done, look, you got to realize that the people of today, we're were basically biologically the same as the people that live in the gangs con days. But we couldn't be further apart in terms of the way we look at the world. It's our software programming. Yeah, exactly. Think about how you are, how Jamie is her, most of the people we know are. And then think about getting his cons mob of savages that were just eating. People are like, uh, Syria. Uh, Carlin gets into that. It's a judgement at, at Nineveh, it's like these people were like public scannings and burnings and because it was just all about just the yoke of oppression in your life was just pain and you wanted to inflict that pain on other people.

Speaker 3:          00:54:03       So you agreed to like, there was like, there, there's like almost like a sort of an evolutionary basis and staying as close to people as you can while agreeing with his little evidence as possible to murder them all. Just like we're like witch trials. And one of the things that freaked me out about Dan Carlin's history of the Mongols thing was he started talking about how there's speculation that decimation like the term decimation came from like a 100. They would eat one of them. Oh no way that they need. Why would eat one? There was speculation that some of the Mongols like decimation, like decimated and it's like destroying, but would it really is like a desperate, like this 10 people you kill one was run out of supplies, but that the Mongols would pick one amongst them and they would eat them so that the rest of the troops would survive.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       I was like, that is so crazy. And the guy was pretty hightest. Like if you were above a wagon wheel, you just cut your fucking head off. Here's what decimation means. The killing of one in every 10 of a group of people as a punishment for the whole group. But that was just the punishment. What Dan Carlin was talking about is there's some people and maybe he doesn't agree with them or maybe he does, but some people believe it's possible. The Mongols did this practice in order to stay alive. They definitely did. They, they used to suck the blood out of their horses and they would add milk to it. Yeah. They're just, they're hungry. They're like, oh, I'm just going to suck some blood on his horse. Yeah, that's how they stayed alive. They would cut the blood, like cut an artery fill like a jug with blood and then they would milk them and mix the blood and the milk together and they would eat that.

Speaker 3:          00:55:42       And then their kids started getting soft because they became quote unquote Chinese. So like they like a Coupla guys. They used to have to send them back to the step to keep their edge. Jesus Christ, you know, it's like, because I feel like, uh, it's like when I call someone like ally of people and some New York people, I call them a indoor cats warehouse cats. It's like, it's, it's like the difference between a pigeon and like a bird of paradise with the big plumes because they don't have any fucking predators. Moshe Kasher is a house cat big time. I love him, but he's. Yeah, he's totally. Yeah, same here. It's like I was with it, but then we'll get into like all this shit where I'm like, it gets all social justice warrior. Like you don't have any natural predators around bear son. Yeah, he didn't. You don't hang out with vets as you drop trees in fucking try to stay off heroin. I would like to take Moshe Kasher peer hunting. That'd be hilarious. Take him into Alberta. Let him see a grizzly lock. Eyes the Grizzly for the first time that quizzy doesn't give a fuck about diversity. It's okay. Mosha. That's patriarchy.

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       Hang a thousand pound thing. That just needs to eat. How much does the Grizzly bear needed? Eta a day. Again, let's get the only gays, but they eat. A lot of gangs. Started screaming. They'll eat. You will. Well the stereotype. Yeah, that guy was gay. Oh, full blonde. Hundred percent grizzly man. The number one greatest unintentional comedy human beings have ever created. It beats roadhouse. It beats showgirls. It beats everything. That is awesome, but still sucks at the same guy did I watched roadhouse at least once a year. Bad. I love roadhouse. Went on a tirade one night on twitter, I was high as fuck and I was watching road house and it was just so ridiculous how gay it was. Like I like, how did I miss this? And so I went on this whole, uh, I went on like a, like a series of twitter posts of Dalton and what isn't that guy's named Sam, Sam, Elliot, Elliot, Sam Elliott and Dalton hanging out together and like, this is the gay shit.

Speaker 3:          00:57:46       How did I miss this? Yeah. And he never really wanted to get with that chick. You always just wanting to be like shirtless and look cool and like doorways and shit. Paint on her. Yeah. Yeah. He just wanted to look tough and cool to her. It was amazing. I know. And like, and like it was the worst bouncer in history, like you're supposed to deescalate. And he's like, oh, you spill a drink. I'm a, I'm going to beat the fuck out of 30 people a bear must eat 90 pounds of food each day. Yeah. If you were telling them to fuck, they may intake one Ali Wong per day during the winter. When food is scarce, oh my God, no, no, no. Grizzly bears are specialized to adapt during warmer months to eat a massive amounts of food so they can live off during the body fat during the winter when food is scarce.

Speaker 3:          00:58:31       So yeah, they don't eat during the winter. Most of the time they just hibernate. So they get like super, super fat intake. Forty kilograms, 90 pounds of food a day. That's Alli Ninety. Well you were talking about on a podcast about a when they blueberries. It's an interesting flavor. I never experienced it, but apparently that's what everybody says. And Steven Rinella had a show about it where he shot a bear on a blueberry patch and then when he's opening the bar up. But you see purple, like a purple. Yeah, it's funny. My new specials literally called feed the bear. I saw that. Yeah, that's what she decided to call it that because like when I get hammered I get like pretty happy and um, and sometimes and occasionally on several occasions I've been like pretty blacked out and just feed them, feed the bear, rather. It's about like sex with my wife or more beers or I'm just like, yeah, feed the bear here.

Speaker 3:          00:59:18       Come on. Feed that bear fruit. The big old bear. Good. Good name for a special as any feed the bear. Yeah. Why not? Yeah, I, I'm horrible at titling Shit. I'll like, I'll come up with like 50 and just having no fucking idea and I just have to pick something. Yeah, they're tough. It's tough. Like you be wacky. DEB self-indulgent degree. Besides Jamie put on the on air light. It's bothering me. The on air light is off. I feel like there's need to be official. This new studio. Watch that. That's awesome. Oh see my Dick just moved a little bit. Mine too. Nice. I feel better. I don't know why I need to see that. I need to shut it off. Turn it on when I walk in the room. Um, but yeah man bears. Fuck bears. Fuck them. So the reason why we had to build houses, I'd be living in tents if there is no mountain lions and bears and Shit and, and black bears are.

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       Everyone says, oh, because we have a bunch of black bears, and they always say, I like harmless. They are, but they're definitely not. You can still fuck you out. Kid got killed last year in Alaska. It during a road race, race, a road rage. The kid was in a road race. He was 16 years old and he was running and he called. His mom, said that a bear was following him and then he might be in trouble and the bear killed him bear. When the park ranger showed up, the bear was trying to shoo them away from his cash because he had buried the kid, pulled the kids body into the forest and was covering up leaves and shit, and they came and he was defending his kill. Yeah, high stakes shit. Fuck bears. Bears. Bears are not Yogi. I'm not saying we should eliminate them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       I'm not saying we should kill them all and make them extinct, but don't put them above people. You are God damn crazy person if they. If you think about your children, think about your mother. Think about people that you love that could easily have been eaten by this bear and understand that these are these things or consequence of the natural world that we engage with and you cannot put them above people. It's just you are a trader to your species. Yeah, of course you're missing the whole lesson that was learned by civilization and we miss it to the people that the only thing that civilization is the key and that fuck the animals, they miss it too. But the people that don't understand what the animals actually are like, you, you're missing a giant wolves will eat your family. There are a lot of herbivores.

Speaker 3:          01:01:38       Well, it's like what you were talking about with, uh, with the people that used to have to break a rabbit's snack to, you know, like my, uh, my mom, my uncle, my mom's brother there were so poor that he used to hunt for their food and then he became wealthy and now he goes to Africa to hunt, you know, the Cape Buffaloes and you know, and uh, the Cape Buffalo, those are really dangerous. And they call them the black death. Yeah. Though I guess they're more dangerous than like lions and shit. They can rip you apart thousands of pounds. They're enormous animals and they, you know, like even lions have a hard time taking those fucking things out. There's a, there's a documentary called relentless enemies and it's about this one area of

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Africa that something happened in the river shifted course and when the river's shifted course created an island, a very large island, but on this island was lions and buffalo and the lions had to get bigger because all they could kill was the buffalo. So these lines, they. It's a really fascinating thing because they think it only happened, man, I don't want to talk at a school because I always do, but I think it was like 200 years ago. I think it was like a real recent amount of time and in that time these lines have developed like hulk, like bodies. They look freakish. The average female lion is as big as the average male lion on mainland Africa too. It's crazy how fast evolution moves. It's like, ah, there's this type of math in England that was white and it used to hide on the, on the Birch, and then when the industrial revolution kicked off, uh, it made everything city in the, in the fucking mouth was black and like 30 years because the birds is kept picking off all the white ones and then like the only three that were black or getting all the pussy.

Speaker 1:          01:03:21       That's crazy. Yeah. It's like a, they say a white person becomes black if they have to live in African lifestyle Subsaharan and 20,000 years like you're totally black. Yeah. Well that's what white is. What? Why does a solar panel for Vitamin d? Totally. That's all it is. Yeah. We're just fucking snow monkeys. Everybody is. Everybody's the same. We would have been way better off. We only looked, we all look the same and the only thing that separated us were how fucking stupid you were. We have been way better off. That'd be an unbelievable. We'd be able to categorize people in like affective ways, but instead you get these white people that are only into other white people like, Hey, fuck heads. It's the least effective categories. So bad. It's such a bad category. Like put dummies versus smarties. That's a good category. Credit category. Same with like, you know, I judge people based on like pleated pants.

Speaker 1:          01:04:09       Whether you can keep a secret, keep a secret as massive. Like keep a secret is huge. It's huge. That's why it's like I'll get on boards or like I'll get on board with some shit's moving around, but I don't want to. I'm not a big reveal guy. I think that shit's for the birds. Big reveal guy. Like when people just talk shit about people or it's I guess what I. Now I know I'm not like that distraction you. They're like, if you don't have to do that, you shouldn't do that. But the only reason why you want to do that is we want to create some excitement outside of what you're actually doing to progress the. The life that you live in, right? Yeah. Unless do like calling someone out like someone committed a crime or something like that. We're not talking about that, but it's like this idea.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       I'm just saying I could keep a secret with a crime too. If you ever come to the instinct, the instinct to engage in that is all. It's all negative. You know, and, and I, I think it goes back to that whole reward system thing were I think in a lot of ways we're very program to not just accept but even seek out conflict and to be upset about things and to like look for those things in the news and look for those things because we don't. How often do you see conflict with humans? You know, like if you see like Manhattan, right? And you see all these people that are driving their cars, walk in, get on the bus, get on the train. The vast majority show no conflict with each other. The absolute vast majority. It's actually amazing. It's fucking magnificent. Chimps were so peaceful compared to what we could be, but now compare that to the vast majority of interactions online.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       No comparison. The online might be 50 percent conflict. Yeah. Yeah. And it's absurd. Conflict. Yeah. It's like I'm going to fuck your mouth with a gun. I'm like, I thought we were talking about healthcare. Wait a minute. You can't even do that to someone explained to you what fuck is. You can't, you know the one on the chalkboard if you fuck my mouth with a gun. It's like when you reveal that you don't know something based on an intense. And so did you see that thing that someone wrote about Ivanka trump? All the different words that she uses wrong and like that she doesn't understand English.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       I mean, look man, how old is she? Like 30. Oh no, she's not. She's not old right now for sure. For sure. Don't 36, 36. I'll give her a pass. So she is 38. I just, you know, most people don't know how to use words correctly and then all of a sudden your fucking dad, the president. You're like, wait, I thought you were reality show host, right? I think I thought it easy road here. What the fuck? I thought I would never reached the public guy. I'd be fucking flying private jets to Israel every year if you're like now and I need to know what magnanimity means. What? What about the yacht on the Caribbean? That's hilarious. That's what I was preparing my 35 years for. All of a sudden after figuring out the correct use of words did I got a massive verbal skills and horrible spelling.

Speaker 1:          01:07:16       I've liked this weird, like my, my ability to hear words, remember words. My vocabulary is huge, but I spent like a fucking idiot. My spelling's atrocious. Like horrible. Yeah. My. Well, I rely on that squiggly line, that red squiggly line. That's so critical for me. But what about no suggestions? I don't play that game man. That's like, you know, like swinging an ax. Well, steel toed boots, but sometimes I don't realize it's in Spanish. Oh yeah. And like as a, you know, I'm flying my late night rants and fly. My thumbs are flying thumbs. So you do everything 100 percent from your phone. Everything from stronger addiction because you're not even pretending you might get a productivity done. Like if you, if your laptop and you've got Microsoft Word Open. Yeah, and occasionally you check twitter like bitch, you don't know shit about Beethoven, but I'm trying to wind down, which is crazy because it's like the worst way to wind down. It's just like cyber conflict. That's not a way to wind down.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       That's not the way to wine because my wife would fall asleep before me and then you know, I don't want to watch TV and be loud and sometimes I'll go in other rooms and shit. But you know, well I think, I mean this is very pretentious to say but, but, but it is true. But I think that all of us who are having a chance to talk about our experiences in this life are influencing each other. That includes you. That includes everybody. I know the clues red should fear and Thompson and Duncan were all influencing each other and we were all in some way helping each other like mitigate all the weird influences that we experience. And there's a big one. The Big One is our addiction to information and that the addiction to information can overwhelm your ability to process the information. Like if you're just reading shit about like world news and a breaking news and all the craziness you're doing that all day while you're awake.

Speaker 3:          01:09:18       Like I say, if you gave your phone, like if somebody had a phone and they had won the mophie packs so they can keep that bitch run and check the Internet all day. At the end of the day, what have you. Have you. Have you even taken the time to momentarily reflect about what any of this means or are you just taking a fucking guy with a truck killed bikers, you know, oh wait, fuck that guy's guy. Oh, Dustin Hoffman's a piece of shit to retweet. How much time are you spending where you're thinking about life yourself, the world around you? What are the motivations for all this? Like this kid that ran over these people in New York, what's his motivation? Who is he? Who did the most awful job ever of parenting this fucking monster? Right? We think that Allah wants him to stomp on the gas and run over a bunch of dark [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       I like, I was just on that bike path of my son and I just, I'm trying to stay objective sometimes and I'm like, Eh. And I'm like, fuck you. It's like emotions. Mac Is Peterson talks about how uh, the, the need for information is the same part of the brain for a foraging food and now that we have all this food reforging other shit, and I think it's like all think that's a really good point and stressed enough now that we have all this food, we're foraging other shit. Yeah. We're forging outrage or forging the need for reform or forging this violent interaction between cultures were forging all this fucking craziness online. Like every day you're seeing more and more craziness. People telling people they can't wear braids. People tell people, tells you. Appropriation is the most insane psychotic thing and it's getting worse. But my twitter timeline think Jamie Kilstein did us all a giant favor. I'm not being disingenuous. I think he did

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       and I, and I don't hate that guy. Look, I've had, I've had bad moments by life, but I've made dumb decisions. Owning up to those dumb decisions makes you a real character like someone of of real character to me. I want to say I was going to say a real man, but it applies to women as well. Like owning up to those fuck ups is so goddamn huge and Jamie did it and I think we need to understand like when someone does do something like that, you gotta, you gotta stand up and fucking golf clap you gotTa, you gotTa, you gotTa, you gotTa let people know that and there's a lot of other people that also could have these revelations in these moments that stand up and, and, and be real with you. And then I, all of us would recognize those moments and those feelings in our own self and we can move on better.

Speaker 6:          01:12:01       We can move on better than we're doing with Jamie did by coming on this podcast and talking about his life as a social justice warrior and all the nuttiness that he was involved in and all the rules and regulations, what you could and couldn't say and how he knew it and even though he thought things were wrong, he couldn't express himself because it would be outside of the progressive doctrine that they had to all follow by. That's giant man. It's trying for all of us because just like Jordan Peterson has expressed that we could all be Nazis if we were that person insurance circumstance with those, you know, those stresses and pressures. That's what terrifies us about all this stuff that you could be that person that if you were born in Uzbekistan or wherever the fuck this terrorist was born, that ran over these people that have all the terrible things that happened to him, happened to you.

Speaker 6:          01:12:50       You could be. That guy was hitting that gas. Right. There's no difference between you and me and Jamie and everybody listening. We're all just people and we're a combination of biology where a combination of life experiences and our community and our circumstances and what we've learned that we have to recognize that instead of like trying to appear to have moral superiority over everybody above you because you haven't committed murder yet or you haven't run a red light, were wound up killing someone because you had an impulsive desire to get to work on time or you haven't got drove home drunk because you've made a mistake and your girlfriend left the party and you were fucking pissed. You got in your car and you plowed into a car. All those things we want to. We want to demonize people because we're scared to death. Fuck. Seeing those ideas in ourselves or seeing those actions and ourselves.

Speaker 6:          01:13:43       Yeah, and that and that soldier that's in line. The line between good and evil is right down the middle of a person's heart. You know, that we have that. None of us are just good or bad and we can't, uh, just, just proclaim someone as bad and as good unfairly. Those are the people I root against. It's not, it's not the flawed humans that make mistakes and just our human, it's the people that demonize everyone but damn, and you see that they're almost just, it's projecting. It's like the biggest homophobes the gay guy, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       and, and that's, and that's what gets me angry and it's like when you're trying to get social, like what happened to me with, with a defined that kid situation where it's like, well, explain that because most people don't know what you're talking about. Most people don't know the circumstances. So, so, uh, there is this, this guy who has a three. He had a three year old boy did, he claimed was transgendered and identified as a girl and started, you know, putting dresses on the kid and uh, treating them like a girl and I was planning on giving them hormone therapy so they don't go through puberty and this dude has like power in Hollywood, you know, and um, and I just called them out and I, I got swarmed and uh, I just didn't stop because I'm like, I'll die on this hill. It's a hill to die on.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       When you were deciding that a three year old has done developing and understanding what drives me crazy when you were talking to is akin to like a seance will you find out that you were a roman emperor from 1700, that fucking three year old barely understands how to express himself. The, the, the idea that a three year old can give you a complex definition of their sexual and gender identity had three and that this isn't something that you should go in and chemically influence that kids sterile, make them a unit. Yes. And it's like, and it's fucking insane. It's a projection of the father's ego. It's not even like is it? Oh yeah. The virtue say, Oh, it's just a coincidence that it's a San Francisco like npr guy that like everyone in Hollywood as his back for some fucking reason. Even as a child, it's like, uh, it's just the circumstances.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       Explain what, what. So this dude, John Hodgman, who I thought I was cool with a, I met him doing a morning radio show and he was like, when Mel Brooks set a pc, shits ruining comedy or something. All these comedians were like going against Mel Brooks and I'm like, wait a minute, are we the bad guys now? What comedians though, Paul have comp time Ken was talking about. Yeah. And I was like, dude, you're like the bad guy from footloose now. And uh, and so I'm just being very open about this because my, and, and am I, it's like there's a few things I'll stand behind. Free speech. Don't fuck the kids, you know, don't hurt the kids. Don't hurt the kids. Like, yeah, just be good to the kids. You know it because that's you. That's, you mean that's what every, every child is you, all of us.

Speaker 1:          01:16:36       I know. Especially when you're a little tiny person, you, you have this insane responsibility as a big person when you're dealing with a little tiny person. And now that I have a tiny person, that's what it made me more of a, a, a man in an adult. Like I, I just felt so much more responsibility to be good 100 percent on the job too. He learned on the job like you realize along the way like, oh, I'm like literally dealing with a blank slate and I can't even process this, that my fucking bizarre, ridiculous life of telling jokes. And in your case, playing songs with pianos and ridiculous shit that you say on twitter this somehow or another qualifies you to raise a human being so intense. It's so it. And also it's like I, uh, I, I've always thought I was a good guy but not like I ever thought I was like deserving of anything special, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:17:29       But then once you see a kid, you're like, he didn't. He's fucking pure steel a man, you know, I'm like, I've done some shit, you know? So that's why I think just as myself younger, I wouldn't have been quite as like into, I've always stuck up for the underdog and people being abused and shit. But now I'm like, I have to be better for like the next generation because I see him look at me like humans can be good. He's like, Dad, Dad, Dad, dad, you know, and I'm like, Holy Fuck that desk a good guy. You know, and like I never really knew if I was a good guy. Right. And this is a good experience between you and him. He's, he's enjoying it immensely, you know, and it's giant and it's just like he watches me, watches me hit my foot with my acts and as like, don't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:14       Do you ever think about the fact that, and this is a conflict that I've discussed ad nauseum with some of my friends at every one of my friends that I know came from fucked up place. All the people that I'm friends with Cowan or Joey Diaz or anybody read band or dunk into their childhood was fucking chaos already. Should fear like everybody's childhood was a mess. Yeah, I think it's A. I think it's to make a good comic. That's still a good dude. I think it's a, it's a combo of like love, like your grandfather and chaos or else we're just. Killers were. That's the problem, right? I think that goddamn comedy and murder are so closely related. I know and we're just on the good side. Killing. Yeah. I mean, that is literally Wiley call it because my mom listened to our last podcast and she was like, I love that you're friends with Joe, like you guys both have like, you're kind of fucked up a good guys where it's like you experienced a traumatic events and, and have you experienced damage, you know, and then you have paths in life and you're like, I'm going to seek the good in this, but we're still, you know, low impulse control comedians.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       But still, you know, we're not just killers, what were, were actually nice people. But we're, we're realizing we're nice people in the middle of all of like a life with a tremendous amount of momentum, of chaos behind chaos. And all the sudden you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Bracey that. Okay. Yeah, like, belly, that beef shit man. You know, it's like, I might as well, I've had a viking ship for the last 10 years where he'd just viking it up and it's like, yeah. And then you see that the order you need the cast in order, you know, and you see the order with the child and then you see these people trying to exploit children. And I was just awake, you know, I'm just like, you know what? Fuck you. I'm like I don't. And then people in La that I thought were my friends, not good friends, not like comics, but like middle management. That's where the evil is. Well you know what it is man. It's like the supporting

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       rights eclipses all the logic involved in the subtle nuances of human behavior and sexuality and the idea that a three year old could have any, any notion of like what it's going to be like to be eight or what it's going to be like to be 16 or whether or not hormonal changes is going to affect the way he expresses himself. So. And also you're looking at this kid and you're deciding that this kid, because there three is going to be transgender and you want to turn them into a girl. What if this kid decides he's a gay man in five years to kill themselves? Right, what it. Well, what if they decide that they're bisexual in 20 years, you know, I can't. If you kill, if you care about that child, you don't interfere with that process because I'm not the same thing that I was when I was three and you're not either.

Speaker 6:          01:20:54       It is so to inject hormones and chemicals and even surgery that we really have a very limited understanding about how much this interaction between the scalpel and a baby body. How much of an impact that has you. You're giving someone the green light is that they're talking about making this kid a unit. Well, yeah, they won't go through puberty and so then it's like they saying, what are they saying? They were called the hormone blockers and I kept asking him directly. I'm like, say yes or no. Are you going to give them hormone blockers because it's fine. If he wants to wear a dress, have some fun playtime fine, but you're going to tell him he's a girl, but here's the thing. It's not even playtime. It's like, what if the kid like feels better when he wears a dress? Fine. Like we're all. We've all decided that pants and a shirt is the way to go and if you don't wear pants and a shirt, I know you're home.

Speaker 6:          01:21:41       I'll like if you were sitting there wearing a big girl skirt, why did I. What do I give a fuck? If you always learned kilt and I'm like, ah, I love Scotland. I wouldn't care. But if you my brothers to piss out of each other. Well, she said that out loud. I have a horse thing. Impulse gave Doug Stanhope pissed on the fear last week, a couple of days ago on a podcast. That's awesome. Yeah, pissing happens. I didn't mean to cut you off. You were talking about the Scottish. Who gives a shit. If you dress like a girl, what I give a shit as if you step in and you in any way interfere with the physical, sexual, biological development of a child because you think it's the right thing to do progressively that you think is the right way, right thing to do. The right way to approach a fucking three year old like you are the problem. There's not this. We're not talking about one plus one equals two. We're talking about a super complex, very nuanced issue and if there's child decides when it's x amount years old, whatever we decide 30, whatever the fuck we decide to take the decision to do to get gender reassignment, that's a 100 percent cool with me chorus. No problem with that, but that's a person who understands who they are as a fully developed organism, not off fucking babies. Three. That's a baby dude and part of me it's like this. I see myself in the,

Speaker 5:          01:23:05       in the kid where I'm like, I played classical piano and knitted like I used to like knit cloth. I used to weave, I went down, I used to the thing we your piano teacher? Yeah. Yeah. Like my. Like my dad is like a. my parents are married that have a great marriage, but it's like almost like a reverse gender marriage in a way. Or my dad's like a flamboyant opera singer, professor and my mom like six. One loves sports, wear sweatpants, you know, like my first bit was I was the only guy in the closet. I used to be like, my dad would be like, let's go see rent again, son. And I'm like, I want to play catch with mom, you know. So I played piano since I was a kid. I, uh. What about your piano teacher? When I was 11, my piano teacher became a dude and the bit I tried to work on that, people don't believe some of the best of the way. That's a long time ago. How old are you now? Oh, I'm 37,000. Ninety one. That was the. Oh Gee shit. Oh, that's, Oh, gi surgery. Oh, that's. And do my piano teacher right now is like owens, totally trans friendly. Like we're friends. But I don't think he realizes what's it become, you know, because it's like now it's like, oh, you don't believe in making a three year old a year full of Hay.

Speaker 6:          01:24:14       Yeah. This is, this is not wise because if you just look at it in, not in terms of like how a child should identify, but in terms of like the biological process of a developing human being, it's very, very touch and go. We don't really understand what it is. This is what you should try to do, what a kid, you just try to give them nutrients you should try to give them love and try to give them safety and try to give them challenges. Totally tends to get over, but. But the idea that you are going to decide by your conversation with someone who just started talking 12 months ago, they're still shitting themselves. They don't know how to talk yet. They shit in their pants, but they literally don't know how to talk yet.

Speaker 5:          01:24:51       I know it's. I identify. It's like, how the fuck does that work? Do you want to be a girl? Like my son's dances, like he's always dancing and shit. He goes to the piano. He does with dad. That does and it's like this kid's probably trying to impress his dad and his dad's this fucking asshole. It's like, oh, being trans is brave dad. And then they're gonna make they're gonna make moves where the kid can't go back, can't go back. It's life is over you. You literally turned.

Speaker 6:          01:25:16       I live down a dark path because here's the thing, and this is super unpopular to say, but the bottom line, whether you decide to become a transgender person, whether you decide to, you know, just to suppress those ideas, it is at this current stage of our understanding of medical science. Impossible to actually turn you into a warm, of course six x, y, so we're going to do is have some reasonable facsimile and it's going to be more reasonable in different people. And some people they have a slender frame, you know, some people have built like David tour and it's just like, whoa girl, okay, I gotta go like you don't have David [inaudible] was big time heavyweight boxer from the nineties

Speaker 5:          01:26:00       and you've touched on our body dysmorphia with like weight lifters where it's like,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       you know, there's certain people that just aren't comfortable in their own skin and want to alter it. Like with like fucking rather that's bigger boobs or cutting your wiener off or some shit. And, and as a very big personal liberty guy, I'm all about you doing that. But you don't make that decision for the kids. You don't make the decision for anyone that's under the age of comprehension. And here's the thing, like what is that age? Because they say that the frontal lobe doesn't really fully developed until 25. Asked Geico. Yeah. Yeah. They don't show you. Yeah. They want to insure you as a male. The insurance is up until you're 25 because you're not developing a uh, I think it's a little earlier. I think girls develop little earlier. I now I. Now I'm fucking pissed. I'm calling some sort of red pill organization. And so long story short, I make these problematic statements and then my agent drops me.

Speaker 1:          01:26:48       And uh, how does your agent drop you for saying a three year old shouldn't be given chemicals that kill his Dick and balls. That was rocking the boat, man. It's a fucking match if you just put it that way. So what you are is pro giving kids dick killing chemicals. Is that what you are? Just let me know. Right? It's kind of like when it's like words are violence. You hold up your fist and you go word or violence like that. It immediately cuts through this shit, but for some reason it's not these days. Or is there violence? I mean, that's a big thing now. And it's like, ah, this college, Yukon, drop me, I'd have like a good gig. And they said, because your views, uh, uh, we can't, you can't work here. And then did they specifically talk about which views? Yeah, I even tweeted the email because I was sick of this shit man views that trans kids.

Speaker 1:          01:27:31       It's only transplants. That's my whole thing. But it's trans babies, dude. It's taught, they're toddlers. They're like three, dude, it's, and I'll die in the hillman. I even asked my brother, I like my buddy, my buddy Mike. Uh, Mike, Mike from a, a sword and scale. Like, dude, I literally was like, I'm, I'm unemployed. And he had me like read, uh, that, that's when you know, your friends are mad. He's like, Yo, will you read this? You can be like a da in this fucking murder podcast. I was like, great. He's like arthritis from cash. I thought I was out. I'm like, brother, can I do some more? Tree work is like $29, you got boots. I'm like, fuck yeah dude. I was prepared man. But think about that, that you as a guy who I've known for a long time, it's been a successful professional comedian or really always that close to being pushed aside and not given work anymore over something that's totally logical.

Speaker 1:          01:28:23       I just got a development deal, true TV and shit. It's not even like I was doing badly. Did they? The True TV keep the development deal. They did not even have reps anymore. But do you talk to Tru TV? No, they're cool people. I just had, I've just been so, like, so the reps all bend you by saying that you don't think three year olds? Well, yeah. And trannies. Yeah. And also I guess I was, I was saying it's a process. It was problematic. I was uh, I was, I was uh, too many, too much. I was just, I was poking people that aren't allowed to be poked at this, these powerful middle managers, you know, what were you doing? Just saying you're wrong dude. When they're like, oh, you poking them about what? That shit like that's good. Are we at Man, can't do that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       I don't do he tweets man. And then the Shaun King Shit where I'm like making a joke that I think it'd be hilarious of slavery. Came back because he'd have to admit he's white and that's fucking funny man. I'm not going to back down on humor. I'm just not. And then he calls me a white supremacist. Actual people with like blue check marks are like, I never knew you are racist. I'm like, you know, I'm not man, you know, it's a joke about him lying about who he is and uh, and I'm not going to explain to people who he is and what that whole story is because I don't know whether it's true or not, but I know what I've seen online and I know what a lot of Milo exposed but files Rachel dolezal right now. I'd be fucking pissed dude. And it's like, even if I'm wrong, let's say he is a black guy with like, well even if he is, let's be honest, like I'm not, I'm not Irish, but I'm a quarter Irish.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       Right? But if you look at me, I look like a Guinea look like an Italian. You know why? Because I'm three quarters Irish or three quarters Italian. So fight. If someone says, are you Irish? If I was going on TV, identifying as Irish man, right? What people are infinitely more part. How much are Irish? Are you? I mean people would say that's disingenuous because no one can tell, nor does anyone care about the distinction between Irish and Italian. You would just a European, hey, you are in America. You know, third generation, no big deal. But there's a reality to that because like what percentage black do you have to be where you say, I'm a black man? Well, because he wants the points. That's why it's not even about pride. And you don't. You will, will, will, will, will. Here we go. You don't want is this shit right there? You don't choose to be trans black. It chooses you. This is my life. My struggle is real. Hashtag wrong skin.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       Yeah. Is that real? That's real. That's real. That is essentially it talks about all the time. Real tweet from Owen's thing that I was looking, okay, we did some shit that I've been tricked about so I could create that. It was a guy, there was a guy that I was following for a while that had a parody account and he was going by Hashtag wrong skin. He was a comedian and he was always talking about himself as being trans racial, but he was doing it like completely preposterous and he would be like, you take like the ultra progressive really ridiculous approach to like almost every argument and then always write like Hashtag wrong skin. Hilarious. Because it all started because that dude poked at me because I had this bit that I want to be a progressive slave owner where I'm like, I'm like, the reason slavery is wrong is because it's only black people. That's not right. That's racism. I want all the people. And I'm like, if you can't outrun the nuts in the harpoons. Yeah, welcome to the club and that's a joke about the absurdity of certain progressive ideals. And then he poked at me somehow and then I was like, this guy's fucking. Well, if I can be really honest about that, I saw fit and I was like, hmm, I see your point, but I think that's like first draft

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       of an idea of like, because I bailed on the joke because it doesn't, it only works in certain cities, but this is why. I mean this is how I felt. I'm like, okay, no, because I don't want anybody to be slaves. Like so like the joke is like it's kind of cruel in a way. Like we're not talking about real people. Of course, the sentiment behind it is people who run slow. Anybody who can't get away, she'd be a slave. No, no read, but you don't really feel that way. You're saying that because you want to poke people. Well, it was extremely. It was honestly, of course, I don't want any slaves. Of course. It was always the upside down, upside down. Satire. Weird. Because that was. I was. I know that it wasn't right. It wasn't quite there. It was like you, you were in the neighborhood, but that's what our job is.

Speaker 3:          01:32:50       Yes. That's the whole thing. It's like everyone thinks that you can, you start knowing the bit, you know, uh, freedom of speech is all about way overshooting then pulling back then fine, you know, and I was overshooting like that's what I do. Why don't they laugh where it's like, look at how this one phrase hurts people and then how you make it not hurt people based on information I didn't previously know. Yeah. You know, and it's like, I'm like, my wife gave me info about. I was doing some bit about how vampires or cultural appropriation for Romanians and I don't even understand what the point was, but it's something to do with Harry Mexicans, women. What is this? W Jamie woody. You trying to find it? He was one in looking for it. He apparently had hit it or deleted those tweets. Now Shaun King is cranking out a boatload of original tweets in a continued effort to dilute last week's Hashtag, trans black and Hashtag wrong skin tweets.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       Oh, so you got a bad response to the know tweeting about that whole thing for weeks and going on into 2016 and a bunch of. You know, I don't give a fuck man, if you want to, I feel the same, literally the same way as you feeling that you are a woman or you feeling anything, anything, but the real problem is like the insisting on that definition in a very specific manner that's disingenuous with your actual background because everyone is essentially. We all came from Africa. That was the original human beings and like we said before, being white is solar panels for vitamin D. that's all it is. It's. We moved to a place that had a lot of clouds and it wasn't anything like Africa and slowly over who knows how many fucking years people changed and you develop paler and Paler skin. That's it. Yeah, so it doesn't matter. I don't care, but just here's, here's a better way to do it. Just act the way you feel like you'd like to act and don't lie about what your background is. Totally. And you can be the exact same person. No one will give a fuck. And the irony is he's trying to get victim status when he's

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       not part of a group and because there is the reason American slavery is so fucking dark is because it was one of the only slave systems based on one race. And that's why like Carlin did an unbelievable. Everything's car like dude Carlin's covered it. He has a blitz episode called, uh, addicted to bondage. Dan Carlin. Yeah. Dan devcon covered a lot of thought. You were talking about it did. I got some of the wolf in May, but like Dan Carlin addicted to bondage. We're all related to slaves and slave owners. It's like, it was, it was actually progressive because of genocide. That's the irony. It's like back in the day and army winds, they kill everyone. And then some Bernie Sanders guy was like, let's keep something alive. And I was like, you're such a fucking lefty, you know. And uh, and so we grew out of that. Thank God.

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       Of course I don't like slavery. I think I'm, I'm almost in this position where like, I'm a little freaked out that some givens aren't given any more. Like what? Like like that Hitler is bad or I don't like slavery where I'm like, it's just a given. It's a given. Like who the fuck? Like slavery. It's like owning a human. There's still a bunch of retards out there that think it's a good idea to be a white nationalist. Right? Yeah. Like Charlottesville, like when you see that guy got pepper sprayed, takes his shirt off, you see a swastika on his chest like, okay, what about the Nazis is awesome to you? Is it just fucking gassing random children? Like, sit down, tell me what do you think is awesome? A bad war plan and Russia, the idea that are you so fucking stupid that you really think the only people of Merit have a genetics that come from a certain patch of dirt?

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       Because that was one of the. That's one of the most toxic ideas. So toxic man share and it, it's, it's toxic in the same way that some of the left shit is toxic too and they both have this toxic element where like unless you look at merit and character, you're fucked. Like if you're like, I'm rather or not, you think white people are special and then you should keep them down or boost them up. It's both toxic. I think like when it comes to Rachel Dolezal like her, her problem is not that she wants to be black and she's not. Her problem is that people give a fuck about what she wants. She just didn't have that land. It just didn't like. Imagine her whole world could be exactly the same. The way she behaves could be exactly the same. The way she dresses her actions, everything. If she didn't utter a few words that like I'm actually black and people like, wait what? Like, and then they go into her history. No, no, no, no, no, you, you want it to be black but you weren't black. You look right.

Speaker 1:          01:37:29       And that just quick, quick, quick. It's just eyeballs. Shaun king, I mean he was a part of black lives matter obviously. He wanted to do good. Obviously he wanted to spread good ideas and help people. The people that he really identified with, if those tweets are real and I don't know if they are Hashtag [inaudible] and Hashtag trans racial and all that stuff, then that's literally how he felt. He didn't feel it because he hated those people. He felt because he identified with them and they're more attractive to him than than what he actually was. So if he just Paul Walden and never said, I mean Paul Wall, right? The wrapper with the grill. I mean, isn't that essentially he's a deep love of black American culture, right? Mean there's a lot of people that just just be themselves and go in. Just go in is what I appreciate more.

Speaker 1:          01:38:14       There's a lot of black people at golf clubs with fucking Polo shirts on. Right? Why? Because they identify with that culture. It's appealing to them. We'll just let people, fucking cultures, everything man. That people. And the irony is is Joey Diaz, he's going to get us grills. You heard about that. And the irony is is like inner city black culture, like things like comes to my shows and thinks I'm funny because they liked that crazy shit. Like man, you fucking funny, you free to talk about things. They just think it's funny. I, I think uh, when I say they, it's annoying because it's like, of course not all black people finding funny, but like that culture, that black redneck white liberal culture where it's like I'm from a culture that's more similar to American southern or urban black culture than a lot of the liberals calling me names and it's just this type of culture that, that bonds through shit talking, you know, like Boston where it's like if you talk, if someone's like, oh, you're dead, you're dead x like a home.

Speaker 1:          01:39:08       I'm like, well, is my dad's didn't kill himself, you know? And then your friends because it's like you've hit the darkest shit and then you're like, oh, we'll make it through a winter. A winter is a big thing to make it through. The people in the west coast have like a way easier, like the idea of what the possibilities are. Then the people that the, the east coast people in the East Coast are regularly confronted with potential death if they're dressed wrong. Dude, I live in the adirondack mountains man. It's like dude. And that's like class. Class doesn't exist in my town. It's you got to fucking shovel. Yeah. What time? Like what time of the year does he get to where you could die outside timber. July. Like by December, January. We hit negative 40. Yeah, no minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is exactly the same as 40 degrees Celsius.

Speaker 1:          01:40:01       That's where it comes to its clients and its, that's where they embrace. And do we have this tiny town in like w what do they do? They get mad. No, we build ice palaces and shit. Do they stock up on firewood in July and August and September and there's none of this pc shit. It's like, except for one issue I got a little piss in my town about because like this year the winter carnival was going to be a fiesta themed about Hispanics, but there's like the only Hispanics are my wife and child, you know? And then they're like, oh no, we don't want to like be bitch. Right. I'm like, it's not. Do you know, I'm like, we could do a lumberjack theme. You fucking idiots, right? Exactly. There's no one vikings me. You could show on Vikings all day long. All Day long. Nobody cares. Big fucking helmet. You big horns. Nobody took calls you a cultural appropriate or if you were like Viking garb or like a

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       st patty's Day. It's a midget looking for a rainbow. Trying to get gold. Yeah. No, trying to fight everybody. You can wear green all day on St Patrick's Day. What else?

Speaker 2:          01:41:03       What will this will this umbrella for me, it's like he's got an nfl tattoo on his bicep. That guy's pretty intense. Lose that guy. My new shadow. Someone would say, oh, it was a fan guys. Jacked guys do it right. Too fanatical. He works out all year just for that fucking scene. Yeah. You can be a Minnesota Viking and nobody gives a shit, but the Cleveland Indians, everybody's like, this is the end of civilization. I know in Vikings were like worse than Isis. Like they would show up and just kill and fucking bail. They were the wrong thing to see if you went to the beach to try to catch some fish and you saw a boat pull up. There was no satellite radio back then. You didn't know what was coming. If you saw a boat in the distance and that boat and a dragon head at the front of it and you're like, oh fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       It's like, do. They just wrote a across an ocean and there were giant, giant time. My ancestors probably a little smaller because it didn't get proper food. Right. I got better at giant back then was like six, two. I did breastfeed for awhile. Those. The thing about Jack Johnson, Jack Johnson, who was the Galveston giant, that's what they called him, but you find out Jack Johnson's Asheville height. He was the heavyweight champion. The were the first black heavyweight boxing champion of the world. I don't think he was any taller than six. Three. Well, that's a way better height. How tall is he? Six. One. Six months. That's the best male height because six, seven bloods. Yeah, but the Galveston giant. Think about that. Think about calling a guy a giant who only six one, but in 18, 78 he was a fucking giant. Yeah. It's almost like the Middle Ages. Professors like the guy that can read one word. He had three wives. Even back in the day. Go, go, go back to that. Please leave that back to the wives. Where's his wikipedia page? He just had it. You go to his whatever it was just if you just go back, it showed the three wives. There it goes. Okay. Yeah. See spouses.

Speaker 2:          01:43:00       He got tired of given the Deq to Irene and then he moved out of the lease. Lucille is, they're all white ladies by the way. Get tired given the dicta her moved on to Eta. Gave the Dick to her. He's like an ll cool j song. Bam. That's crazy. I was looking for overlap. Hold on, go back please. Jamie's just a click and feet. He loves clicking. Look at that. I'm the last one is I read was last one. I guess 1946. Didn't what? How did he die? He died in some strange way, but uh, he was only 200 pounds to. There was a giant back then. Imagine that. That's so intense. Yeah. That's nuts. I mean, you've got to be like 2:40, right? How much you want to 50? I'm like, I'm like 15. Over two because the beers and the fires. Beers and fires everyday.

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       Shit Buddy. Fire doesn't put weight on you. I know it'd be a drink the beers and it also makes me cook a lot at meet with like fucked up sauces. What does it say? Does it say his death? It was a really interesting thing because it's pretty widely believed that he took a dive when he lost the title and then he was just tired of getting arrested constantly and harassed and he just wanted out. He was sick. A crushing sick of white people, you know, he's banging a little white chicks. That was the heat. That was some heat back then to it that I could get you killed. That was way before [inaudible] dot com. Like we didn't have your bag. Him. What is. He died in a car crash on US highway one near Franklin, North Carolina. Wow. After racing, angrily from a diner that refused to serve him.

Speaker 2:          01:44:38       Pissed dude. He's like the opera closest black hospital sake. St Agnes Hospital in Raleigh and he was 68 years of, uh, of age at the time of his death. He was buried near at a WHO's, I guess his last woman has grave, was initially unmarked, but a stone that bears on named Johnson now stands above the plots of check at a Anne Irene. Wow, that's dark man. It's really crazy. I mean, that guy was just born in the wrong fucking time. That was bain man. That guy was born in darkness. Like imagine being black in the fucking early 20th century. Like Holy Shit. And he just rose champion. He became the champion and a, an interesting style. If you watch the way he fought, he fought different if different than other people. What did he do? Well, he just had, he just had a long reach and had really good power for the time and he was just very smart.

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       He knew what a drag guys that deep water and beat the fuck out of him, but he fought like a murderous puncher who's a middleweight champion named Stanley Ketchel. It's a fascinating fight because Stanley Ketchel only weighed like 160 pounds, this tiny little dude, but it was just a little savage. Stanley Catcho, Jack Johnson on the Chin and fucking dropped him and it was like a big deal at the time because everybody wanted a white guy to beat the heavyweight title holder and the White Guy was way smaller. Like, look how small catchall is. I mean, he's fucking way smaller than Jack Johnson. But Jack Johnson overestimated him. And Stanley catcho caught him with a murderous righthand. Stanley Catcho was a savage. He was the middleweight champion of the world. Ideas at him. Sorry this says, Tom Burns to like Mike Tyson's punch out, beat the shit out of Tommy Burns. Go see if you can fight any.

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       Slowly tortured him and beat him up. See Find Stanley Ketchel. Stanley Catcho was the guy who was the middleweight champion. And uh, it was a really interesting thing because Jack Johnson seems like it's taking it easy with them for a little bit and then capital catches him with a bomb. Oh, is that it? This is like, look, they had like warmup stuff. They were warming up and they showed them training, like how they would train back then. It's really interesting. Nobody knew what the fuck do. I'll just run through the streets and shit. I shouldn't be run. That's awesome. They're just trying to figure it out. You know that Stanley catchall way smaller. Just waste more than Jack Johnson. Johnson might've been 30 pounds heavier than him. Maybe even more. Do you think like a mighty mouse could take that dude right now? Oh yeah, for sure. No, he wouldn't. Not Boxing.

Speaker 2:          01:47:20       But in mma you would never hit him. He wears. I mean, unless you figured out some way to stop him from moving and him in. He's so fast. He would anticipate your movement and he would just slowly dragged these fucking guys to the ground. He's like, Neil, for Matrix. It's like I started watching a bunch of clips based on your indoor, like talking about, you were talking about how he's like pound for pound. Just the craziest fighter ever. So my best. It's not the craziest because he doesn't, he doesn't fight crazy. Fight Smart, you know, see if he could find were canceled, drops them because it's a big deal because nobody expected it. I think this is already will catch us getting fucked up. You see his face. Oh look at that. He got jacked just back it up. Just a hair so we can watch that again. This is a back of the time. This is a giant deal because Stanley Catcho was a white guy and they were like, finally we got a black guy down on the ground and it wasn't even a big white guy that did it, you know, and everybody wanted Jack, Jack Dempsey to come back

Speaker 2:          01:48:28       there still there. We're still in denial at the point that like black people. That's a serious right hand now. I think Jack Dempsey actually was after this. Now that I'm thinking about that, I'm like, I'm wrong. They wanted Jim Jefferies, I think no clue. Was it that they want he beat? Who did he beat towards the end of his title reign man, my boxing histories. Terrible dude. After he got knocked down, it was almost like he was like, ah, fuck this. And he just, he just went crazy and just took them out. Literally it was going down before you got hit. I was weird. So that again, it might have been that he got caught with his legs tied up. Watch this step on the foot. Nope. Hmm. One more time. One more time. Please watch your step forward. He. Yeah, he was almost like going down because he knew the power of the punch. He definitely got clipped though as well as also ducking his head and got clipped on the way down, but he was ducking way down where he might've fallen down or at least fallen off balance even if you didn't get hit, but who is this? Who's the main do that? He went back and forth with go to the web to is wikipedia. James Jeffreys may think it is James Jeffreys. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:49:37       but at the time when this was going on to have a black heavyweight champion, I mean, I don't think we can even fathom the level of racism this guy experience unreal. I mean literally every day worrying for his life. Meanwhile throwing hot dick at white chicks, but it's almost like the gang kind of thing where it's like that environment of just darkness made him such a fucking diamond. J Neil still lived 20 years old and Ralphie may as I bought her man, I was a good dude. He wasn't good dude. What? I mean, think about the life of a person that lived back then. He made it 68, died in a car crash because he was mad that a bleachers wouldn't serve him. That's cool. That's good way to go out though. I guess it's not the worst way. It's quick. It's better than being hung by some racist for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       I do. Being hung with suck. That sucks. If you're going to be executed well, what do you pick? Are we really doing this kind of stuff? What do you want to talk to them guys? Come on, try and do bits. Guy Hangs people. Um, what's the worst now? How would you want to go out? Like let's say you're actually are your sentences daddy quick. You want a quick bullets are quick bullets for sure. I used to say lethal injection, but that shit's all bullets. If someone knows what they're doing, you know, you get someone to shoot you. That actually knows how to shoot people. What if you just get hit in the deck and they understand that? That's a bad way to Dan to end like that catcher? Yeah. Just get hit right in the deck. Like the head of the Dec. Not even like the ball is just no more.

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       Dick. How loNg is it going to be before if you got shot in the foot and your foot blows off, they could take you to a lab and they grow you a new foot. I think it's soon. I feel like it's soon. I feel like it's within 20 years. I feel like within 20 years they're going to be like, if you, if your hand got mashed and some sort of advice, they're going to be able to give you a new hand. I think it might even be sooner. It might be, but I'm given to 20 years, so I look smart when it comes. True. Yeah. like you called it you were like, yeah, I feel like in 20 years and be like, yeah, you called it for. I'm more. I'm all about brains where it's like, I just don't want to go crazy. Yeah. Well they, well not only that, we want to be able to repair people that have been injured, like car accidents.

Speaker 2:          01:51:49       Yeah. Do you know the story of sam kinison? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. About how. Yeah. Go tell the story though. He, he was one way as a child and then his mom says that he got hit by a car and then after that he was wild. Just crazy. I mean he really got hit, like to the point of, you know, they were worrieD he's going to live. He survived and he became a fucking maniac. And tHis was talking about you with tomatoes he got on twitter and just lost his representation. No, but I think that, I think that about myself a lot of times because I got hit in the head a lot when I was young and I'm like, well, how much does that affect me? Affect my rational thinking? How much does it affect my ability to control my impulses? You know, like, um, I was, I'm on a flight once with michael irvin and michael irvin who's a really good guy, was talking to me about kids who grow up in terrible environments in that these kids, if they're in the room, the womb and their mother

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       is experiencing violence or stress or domestic violence or you know, she sees crazy shit that those impulses go through her body and they directly affect the way the fetus develops. And the children who grow up with violence around them, like literally they're conceived and they have, they develop inside the womb of a mother is experiencing all that. They have a higher propensity for violence, a shorter fuse. They're more worried about things going badly and it was more intense. More quick to pull the trigger and that all of that is a direct response, like a biological support system, like your body's trying to keep you alive and that the more you encounter that sort of reinforces that. The more times you get hit, the more times things hit you, the more times you get hurt, the more times you know you crash heads as a football player, you get punched in the face as a boxer.

Speaker 3:          01:53:40       The more times a tomato hits your fucking dome at 90 miles an hour by some kid who thinks it's funny, but whatever it is, like what? Whatever things that are rattling your skull, those things reinforce your brain's idea that violence can come at any moment and you have to be prepared and that's that. That quick alive. It's the scorpion and the frog. Shit. It's like your nature keeps you alive and that quick trigger I think translates to various aspects of your life, not just to things where there's a real situation you have to deal with. Like, you know, you have to be able to react quickly because your body is programmed to be. Oh, I get hit a lot. I'm ready. When things come to me, I'm going to fucking fight him off. I'm gonna fight them. I'm ready for somebody. Talked some shit on twitter.

Speaker 3:          01:54:21       I'm going to say something, kevin shit to you, you fucking piece of shit. I'm gonna. Say something that's going to allow me to call myself a white nigger. I'm reading, like I said at first drives drive crazy verbal nuclear weapon on people. It's like I knew a lot of girls that were like a sexually abused kids. His kids, it became promiscuous because they're like, I'm going to fuck you before he fucked me. You know what I mean? Like, that's, that's common. Well, there is that, but I think there's also something that happens with people that were sexually abused as kids where they become hypersexual as they get older. For sure. It's not, it's not good. I mean, we're not looking at this in a positive way, but I think course activity where we're talking about when it comes to, um, through a history, human beings molesting children, that it was insanely common and it probably wasn't until like what, what year?

Speaker 3:          01:55:12       So people realize that it's a horrible thing to do. Was it like the 18 hundreds? It's just one dude's like this is crazy because did they did the same thing with violence? Like infantry comes from infant, like they would send the infantry was always like 12 year olds. What tree comes from Infants for cannon fodder man. They used to just send out the kids to get fucked up. Really? Yeah, like right now in africa. Glad these, like little militias like the kids is when you get the sociopath because if you don't raise them right, they'll fucking kill anybody. God damn.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Oh dude. It makes me so because I like, my town was riddled with like pedophile priests and shit and so it had a real bad situation with riddled because we had a mon senior, there was messed up. I'm long dead shit so it doesn't matter. But like he would bring in other ones and then they were just. Do you think he talked about it? Yeah, for sure. What do you think that I said I can't even imagine man lays there. I bet it was some kind of code and just kid pushes back. Dude. I was always an I. I never, I never think they talk like girls like guys talk about girls like guys talk about girls like girls. She loves coke and she's down to fuck. Like do you think they literally talked about abusing kids the same way a man would talk about or a woman even?

Speaker 1:          01:56:28       We talked about hooking up with a guy he's got a big deck is going to be awesome. You talked about It like in an openly sexual way. I can't, I, I don't. I don't even know fuck. Like it's just like is there some. Did they use that code but it like it crippled. My town is full of like there's some weird shit going on there with that. Like not the town I live in now, but the other like where I'm from, great people love where I'm from, a lot of pride where I'm from great town, but like there's some shit going down, you know, crazy that you'd be in this great area and just one element makes the whole thing chaos. Just raw and everybody accepts that element because in some perverted way you really think all that kid fucking is connected to god through it.

Speaker 1:          01:57:10       And It always was the kid with no dad and shit. That's why I'm fucking, I have this hyper like, like you were talking about that response shit. That's mine where I'm like, if you're going after vulnerable people, it makes me insane. well that was the sandusky thing, right? Like he would always go after kids that didn't have a family and he would help them and he created all these organization, this organization rather to uh, you know, like a charity organization. Yeah. To help these young kids and he's just do it. And that's why I get furious about the people that misrepresent themselves a lot more than the. Like there's all these scandals in hollywood now and, and you know, the spaces in the weinsteins of the world are so much more dark and evil than like, you know, there's that scan with andy dick and I like andy dick.

Speaker 1:          01:57:55       I'm like the dudes and obvious dick robber and he feels bad about it and he fucking just wants to get punched. When they asked him what did he, what was his initial, what was his initial comment? Was something like a kissing and licking his. What he does, he's been doing it for something like that. No, ma misbehaviors. His middle name or misconduct misconduct. They're signing up for something. yeah. Yeah. That, you know, they were upset because they fired him from an indie film because of sexual misconduct. By the way, I hate to be cynical because I don't want to say that anybody who wasn't victimized, but if I was running an indie film that was so fucking stupid, I hired andy dick. I might be the type of guy that would make a statement about andy being andy, just like we're going to put our foot down.

Speaker 1:          01:58:43       he enough capital and you ever have enough and then, hey, if you want to see this film, it's going to be appearing at the sunset plaza and blah, blah, blah. It's a good move. At least gets people talking about something that they would never have talked about because andy dick hops into the river of speculation as to who's a molester. Yeah. But like for me, he's so much law, like he's just, he's not going to make. Yeah. It's not like the snake in the grass where you like, oh, that guy's misrepresenting himself, don't cosby. Exactly. It's, it's a dude is like, oh, I grabbed the deck and got knocked out. He's always just like a deep rabbit. He tried to grab my dick. I knocked them down and then he apologized and I was like, you're all good man. I know that you're just freaked out.

Speaker 1:          01:59:26       You get excited about weans man. And rita was like, oh, thanks for not really fucking up any dag. And I'm like, he's vulnerable. it's vulnerability, dude. It's like some people are just these vulnerable people and like I'm a giant, like he's not trying to. It's not about power, he just blacks out and grabs winners, but he's also like in a different way than you. He's a perpetual button pusher but it's not necessarily like the worst thing in the world to be that button pusher. But that is what he is. He's not, he's not as competent with it as you. He doesn't navigate the waters grabbing dick's, andy's, but like, you know, there's hills and valleys to like your interactions with people and like there's certain hills where you like, you go, you could just get way too crazy with it. You bring it down and he tried to figure out what's, what's a good middle ground?

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       Andy just, it's all spikes. It's all like ah, the ground and that's what I have a hard time judging people. Like the pr person I've always been is trying to not be judgemental. It's the, it's the snakes that I'm like, oh you're, you're telling everyone about global warming in your private jet. Like you can go fuck himself, you know? And it's like, it's the same with like andy, I'm like, andy has never acted like not a train wreck dick grabber. And lIke when my friend died, the dude wrote me a fucking sweet email. Like he's a sweet man. He just blacks out, tries to grab wieners, gets sober, no more winter grabs. And so when I see them getting pulled to the mock, I'm like, you can't associate him with these like power fucked up guys that are like, you want to watch me whack off on a ficus?

Speaker 1:          02:01:03       But here's the thing, like the park guy, can zack I ever make it back now because no one's for them anyway. You know, It's, it's not like a iron man. it's like, yeah, that dude, he used to do a lot of fucking drugs, but we're still rooting for him because he's vulnerable. You know? It's like no one's. No one relates to the guy whacking off on a fucking plant in front of gwyneth paltrow. You're like, bro, you're out, man. You're out. You're out. You're out of the tribe. That's why the dude didn't. You just Interviewed a kill scene or whatever. Like he has a way in, he has a way back in because everyone relates to reward it. He's not like actually raping. People just got mixed up and like, like likes on twitter

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       and shit, but this is the idea that I want to explore because I think it's fascinating. is there a point where a guy fucks up too many times? Like say if harvey weinstein jerked off into one plant. One time he was on coke, he got crazy and he's hanging out with someone. She's like one of the naked vampires and dusk till dawn, but she doesn't get to talk to snake on her and she's so hot and he's so fat and so gross and he's so coked up and so drunk and he also has a billion dollars in the bank and he started saying, well, I can put you in a fucking movie. I can put you in. If I could give him benefit of the doubt. I'm like, that guy loves photosynthesis. He loves it. Like, dude, get synthesis. He's whacking on a plant. He's like, yeah, you take fucking carbon.

Speaker 3:          02:02:24       You know what photosynthesis is convicting can changing sunlight, sunlight into food. RIght now we're talking about whacking on a plant, but that's not photosynthesis in the plant making shit. Yeah. But photosynthesis is like the specific process of, uh, of, of a plant converting sunlight into energy. No emphasis. I have no impulse control. Let's find out what that is because I could easily be wrong, but I thought that photosynthesis meant converting. Turning light. Light. Yeah. That's sugar, right? Just not come. so turned out bro. He's like, look aT you making sugar out of sight. Oh, I get it. Oh, okaY. So he got excited by the photosynthesis. See, that's the thing is now people are starting to treat me like I'm this like moral high ground guy and I don't wait, hold on. Who is doing that because of the fucking standing up for three year oLds.

Speaker 3:          02:03:11       And I'm like, dude, I wouldn't judge one plant whack. I'm not as the difference between the, you know, like transgender three year olds and some coked up studio executive course. Here's the thing, I don't want to excuse anybody's behavior that's done anything to victimize other people, but it is a fascinating aspect of hollywood culture that forever, if you wanted to get a part, you had to go to the casting couch and everybody knew it and there was a lot of those guys that had disproportionate relationships like they were disgusting. He's disgusting and his wife is fucking smoking. Ever seen harvey's wife. She's smoking and no need to bring her into this at all, but I'm just explaining like this is a consistently disproportionate relationship that exists throughout hollywood. Like there's the guy who was insanely wealthy but physically vial and he somehow or another managed to dunk his dick and attends before he coaxed himself into an early grave.

Speaker 3:          02:04:10       That is a fucking common common common theme. Yeah, and I'm not judging that guy who's just getting tans when he's a two. That's the american dream. How would you do it though? Exactly? It's about hating limit. It's about it is about him, but thIs is my point. It's like you do not get to dunk your dick intends unless you do all the things that that guy did. He produce shakespeare in love. That's a dictum. I'm not. I'm not excusing him. I'm not exonerating him and I'm like, women do not naturally feel attracted to obese guys with bad skin. It isn't. This is not a common thing. like in order for him to force the outcome that he desires, he has to cross cultural inappropriate boundaries. You know like this is just like we're dealing with like mathematics or literally, and I'm not exonerating him. Again, I can't believe I have to say this, but I don't want anybody taking this out of context.

Speaker 3:          02:05:02       If you are dealing with this as a system, as a biological system, like say if you're looking at it from afar and you had no connection to culture, no connection of civilization, you'd be like, well, what is this? How does this system working? Like how is this one like extremely flawed biological entity oozing its way into these perfect shapes? A good finds, a way to penetrate these perfect shapes with thin waist and perfect asses and beautiful faces and his face is just this pile of slava numbness and just discussed and is growing hair on top of it and a little fat dick and just shoots incompetent sperm into the mouths of tens. LIke what? What? What is happening here? What is happening here? What's happening here is there's no way he would've been able to do it any other way. It's like so like he's not thor, right?

Speaker 3:          02:05:53       He's not a, he's not some fucking Ryan Reynolds type character with perfect cheekbones. He's just like blah. And he's just feeding that back with coke and fucking booze and blow jobs and, and constantly trying to put out more things that allow us to buy the biggest fucking house, the highest sales. And I mean this is literally the only way he can do that. We can do that as to be disgusting. Like girls aren't just going to line up. I loved, I loved your movies and I'm just like, do it to me what you want. You'll get one out of a million that do that, but that's not enough like they have to. They would have to find him through the crowd. That's not gonna work. It's not going to work. It's almost like that crazy mindset, and again, not exonerating, not excusing, but that mindset of like, look, what is the mindset of someone who wants to run the fastest race?

Speaker 3:          02:06:47       What is the mindset of someone who wants to make the fastest jet bike zero to 100 time we fucking hanging onto these handlebars. What is the mindset of that? I don't know, but it seems to be some sort of bizarre croissant, competitive biological environment where people are chasing some strange, unattainable, highest ground, right? Yeah. It always comes from a, like a slight flaw, lIke the sand makes the pearl. The calla comedians are little flood. Like somebody come at it and I like. They were talking shit, but I was like, you're so right to go, dude. Owen is the tallest do with the napoleon complex I've ever seen, and I was like, you're fucking right man. It's like ambition comes from this weird like feeling of threat where you're like at any moment I like, I gotta try, I gotta work really

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       hard. I was trying to work on this bit but it just never went anywhere about like um, civilizations based on cock size where you got the japanese and the english took over the whole world because they're, their chick is like we need more, you know, your dick. No good. and then like sub saharan africans have these monster hammers and their chicks like you're not taking over shit. You got that big old caulk and they just stay put exactly where it's almost like ambition sometimes can come from insecurity, which I am riddled with and a lot of ambitious people are totally. Which is the point that I was making is like you have to be disgusting to want to chase down, tail to the point where you're willing to rape as like at that level. Right. And it's like, and I think like that guy gets a billion dollars and he realizes chick still don't want to fuck him.

Speaker 1:          02:08:16       And he spirals. Why don't think it matters. I think he's constantlY caught up in the pursuit of doing it, you know, and I think probably it was like super exciting to get the young starlet who like didn't know any better, didn't, didn't, you know, wasn't really 100 percent sure she was gonna make it in hollywood and having that threat of like controlling her career over her, like a giant vampire. And then that Was the horrific nature of it for those women. That's what's getting people particularly angry about this. Not that he was a fat gross guy trying to get laid. Like we've seen those throughout the, throughout human history has always been people trying to get laid, but is that he was doing it in a way that was victimized. Exactly. Costing psychic scars. Yeah. Because like what does this, brett ratner, same stuff today?

Speaker 1:          02:09:02       Well now it's just getting crazy. It's just like, it's going to be like kermit the frog. It's under control, but it's like a, like I'm the opposite. I need like a ton of consent. Like I'm like, it's like, oh, I like your dick six, but, but you don't love the dick. Have you ever seen people like there's been people that have said that you should have a consent form and that you should videotape the signing of the consent form? I was watching this youtube thing with this guy was talking about consent forms and like that you should get people to sign a consent form and like what Michael Jordan does that shit. I think if you're like a billionaire maybe, but like that's fucked up. That takes away the whole thing. Well it's definitely a different thing. It's like what a consent form. It's like a merger and acquisition of two companies like your dick, dick ink and pussy corp was like, are you cool with this?

Speaker 1:          02:09:46       And you gotta sign that shit. Well, I mean you're seeing things where people didn't feel cool about it many years later, but in the moment maybe they just let it happen and then you decide that that letting it happen was way worse. You know? Then they were thinking about it at the time and then decided some sort of a sexual assault and then it spirals onward and outward. It's like, you know, it would be really nice if people were just attracted to each other. I know, but like, it's like someone pasted some of these people though when they're talking about like eye contact being some shit. Like I had a friend like this is, this is dark, but whatever. Uh, there was um, you know, she was kidnapped and like gang raped and nothing. Yeah, dude, it's like there's so false or

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       like stupid accusations that like, it clogs up the system to the point where I'm like, you know, I wanted to just kill these people, you know? And like the wolf is getting in me, the wolf will, that the boost urban. I'm talking about how I want to kill people. Standard on this podcast goes up once every couple weeks. But uh, yeah, it made me really a fear infrastructure. Like where I'm like, oh, the cops come with a pencil. It's not that csi shit. And it's like there's peace, there's people out there that legitimately hurt women and I, I want them to die. And it's like, you know, there's a nine month wait, I'm like a rape kit because fucking some chick regretted some shit when she was like texting and coming over with condoms, you know, I'm like, we got to start triaging some of this shit, you know?

Speaker 6:          02:11:16       Well, you gotta we have to be very, very strict on both sides of what we tolerate, you know, and we, we, we, we cannot tolerate real rape. But we also cannot tolerate false accusations to 100 percent. Cannot tolerate indulgences where people have distorted perceptions of reality and they paint what they know somewhere at least subconsciously to be some very inaccurate interpretation of the events, of course. And we also can't, can we, we can't condone the cosby type shit that went on for years. We can't condone rape. We can't condone people who drug people or abuse people. We can't condone that shit. Don't either. One of those things. But I think more importantly is there's something going on right now where there's a hypercharged environment where people are terrified of being called out and people are like waiting, like looking around like what's gonna happen next?

Speaker 6:          02:12:13       And then people are thinking about some shit that happened to him a long time ago. Well, you know what? This has been fucking sitting in my craw for 18 years. Dustin hoffman. It's time. The world knows and not like hard boiled eggs. Dustin, I don't know what's true and I don't know what's not true. I do not know. I cannot comment and no one can, but it's this. There's something that's going on where this I would hope and I. This is what I always hope. I always hope that any wave that goes this way eventually goes that way. And I hope that any outrage leads to more understanding. Yeah man, all of this stuff and all of this, especially this fucking rape shit, that I feel like there's more rape talk today and more understanding of how many girls get approached or fucked with or harassed or even actually raped or drugged than we ever thought before that. I'm hoping this conversation leads to more understanding early on in people's lives before they formed this idea of what is and isn't acceptable.

Speaker 5:          02:13:14       Yeah. Because that's a good thing from it is it is making people be like, you can't treat women this way, especially

Speaker 6:          02:13:20       young kids here at early for sure, but hear it when you're young so that you don't ever grow up in some sort of an environment where the people around you tell you it's okay that it's us versus them and fuck those bitches. Whoa. There's a lot of people grow up with that. I know and it's like, you want to be so good that women want to fuck you. That's what makes civilization grows. It's the. It's the move. Dude. You know what? I can say beethoven by ear. You think it wasn't for someone to take. I had a great penis. No, I'm just kidding. I started when I was three. I didn't know what I was doing. You did somehow knew that you were a male identified as a piano player. I always say be the man that you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid.

Speaker 6:          02:13:57       That's awesome. Just be that guy. We can all do that. And by the way, if you weren't that guy two weeks ago and someone keeps sticking to your face, it doesn't mean you're not that guy now. Alright, relax. Everybody relaxed with the finger pointing. Like if some dude make some sort of a terrible mistake, goes off the rails a month ago or whatever it is, just it doesn't mean that he's not. He's, he's an ineffective process. He's a trial and error process and you can't judge someone tiredly by the errors, forgiveness and growth. It's also like you gotta, you gotta, judge the whole thing as a big picture. You can't say, you know, in 2001 arnold schwartzenegger pulled out his dick and a sauna. Yeah. AnD he was jacked up. He's trying to beat some people in weightlifting that was probably trying to have a psychological and intimidates.

Speaker 6:          02:14:46       I went to. I made love to hook this. You want to touch the deq word goal happen. You think you can clean and press. You think you can fit this in your mouth. You're less of a man. And the woman is a woman. And another thing is we can't keep calling men like toxic because men, good men keep these fucking shitty rapist men beaten down. Somebody put this on a fucking poll the other day and they Sent it to me. Somebody put, they saw a photo of it or they saw an image of it and they send it to me. Whether they tooK it themselves. It said, eliminate masculinity. Ah, listen, when the vikings come and do that, good a need. Men in the most masculine guys I know are the least likely to fucking rape anybody. They're the ones that defend women. Well, there's a few women are attracted to.

Speaker 6:          02:15:36       Yeah, there's, there's some dark law. And you know what? Here's the thing about a lot of those dark people, the dark, like the color. I mean he meant pigment john. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't. The dark mindset, the, the predatorY rapist mindset. There's a ton of those people that come directly from trauma that come from being violated themselves. TheY come from being in bad situations. They come from being programmed incorrectly and exempt. Again. I'm not exonerating them. I'm not excusing them. I'm just thinking that it would do us all a world of good if we could look at these people from afar. I didn't experience that. I didn't grow up in a familY filled with crime. I didn't grow up in a family filled with violence and murder and, and, and, and I did a neighborhood filled with people robbing people left and right. I didn't grow up with thAt. So my looking at it as a complete third party outsider. but I'm thinking I try

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       to pretend to imagine what it was like to grow up in watts in the 19 sixties. Yeah. Try to pretend what it was like to be incompetent in the nineties. TrY to pretend. Well this is where I think transcends that is still cruelty because like all hang with legit gang members and feel safe when you're hanging with cameras. Well I'll do like cleveland and bravo and then afterwards I'm smokinG blondes with like dudes that I, you know, have leveland improv has gang members waiting for some fucking people. Man. It's like, you know, someone's wearing a bulls hat and a city without red or like someone's got teardrop tattoos and like I don't feel scared because I don't like if they have a body count, it's because of threats and business. It's not like cruelty and I think that there's even in like fucked up environments, you still have the cruel man and the good man, even if they like do things that you don't agree with in your social economic area.

Speaker 1:          02:17:22       THat's the hero's journey, right? The strong person that's kind enough to take care of the people that are weak. That's what the, what everybody wants, right? As someone who is a strong person that looks out for the week person, which is why everybody like the term bully, which I think it's overused, like sometimes bullying gets used when people are equals in. When someone is critiquing someone, oh, you're a bully. I go, listen, I just think that's stupid. That doesn't make me a bullet. You're using it wrong. This is not. We're not talking about children. We're not talking about people that are physically weaker than me. Like let's, let's be clear about what the fuck we mean when we say this very polarizing word, but that word is polarizing because we absolutely don't want to be the person that's in the position of physical, moral, ethical, economic, whatever it is, superiority who has influence over the other person's life and steps in and fucks with it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       yeah, that's what it. That's what a bully is. Spine, okay. With passion can be like, fuck these people and people are like, okay, even if you're a little off the mark, you're not trying to hurt people to make yourself feel better for your own inadequacies. That's what's evil. Or if you are, you need to understand that that's what you're doing, right? because we're all equal. We're all evil and good. Just make the move. But also just to have someone like pointed out makes you go, am I like and think about it? You, you're not necessarily your words and your actions, which you are as how you've dealt with your past words and actions and make corrections. I mean, that's, that's really what you are. I mean that's. And that's what's really important because if we don't give people that leeway, they don't ever learn from their mistakes.

Speaker 1:          02:18:56       they don't ever learn from their mistakes than we were essentially committing to a future with no one learning anything. Right? Yeah. And it's like I gave on dave smith and steven crowder both this a compliment. It's like, because even if you disagree with someone, the thing I love about people is like if you make a good point, they look excited and happy versus threatened. Even if you're not on the path that I'm on, you're still trying to like carve your fucking sculpture with it to look beautiful and not a threatening posture. Yeah. And that has nothing to do with the left or the right. I mean it's really Just how you approach information. Yeah. To all 100 percent. Yeah. Because I think a lot of times people from the right do not want to accept good ideas from the left and vice verse. I think that's just a, that's a real issue that people have.

Speaker 1:          02:19:43       And that's a weakness too. It is a weakness and I've experienced it from my own mind and I'm sure you have from yours, bro. You've seen my twitter. Everybody has. It's important that we realize like what, what is that reaction that we had and how do we, how do we mitigate the negative aspects of it and how do we figure out how we got to that point where we said something maybe we didn't believe or we, we, you know, we, we reacted to something in a way where if given time to reconsider our, you know, the potential going this way with it are that way with it, we'd probably come up with a better idea and a cool thing you do for men, especially men, because I could speak on behalf of men because I identify with the winter and balls. Thank you. It's like you, you, you make people think about their actions where it's like, but I think about mine, think about yours too, which is why we gravitate to each other 100 percent where it's like, is this good?

Speaker 1:          02:20:31       Is this, is this productive for me, my family society? Like what exactly am I doing right now? And it's like, and with my recent shit, like some people are like, oh, how's your wife feel about your spiral? I'm like, spiral. I'm like, she's never wanted to fuck me more. Do you tribute your twitter numbers? Keep going up to I know my where's the spiral? I know and I'm like, oh, I'm representing a group of people that they keep writing me emails. Like thank you so much for not calling me just evil for my, like what I, you know, my basic beliefs because I'm not supporting racist, sexist, bigoted, homophobe kay kay kay, you know, it's fucking crazy dude. And it's like, and I'm not going to fall in that trap either. where I'm like, oh, I'm jewish grandmother, my wife's hispanic, my piano teacher's fucking trans.

Speaker 1:          02:21:13       It's like, no, my idea is strong and I don't need to justify it with my association with people that you fucking could have justified it. And with good reason like it really does. It is a trump card. When you say, look, my dad's probably gay. Hey, look, my dad wears outfits that are questionable, but he's a loving man. Hey, look, my my piano teacher used to be a dude, a woman as a woman. Now dude. Yeah, I became aware of same thing. It's all good. it's all there. Like, like hispanic and crane. Spanish like home depot, mexican. Yeah. Anybody, anybody that calls you a white supremacist like, okay, I see what you're trying to do and it is so transparent that it minimizes everything you're ever going to say ever from this point on, on this subject, because I always have to think, well, you're intentions are disingenuous. Well, you're trying to do is divert people from tHe actual reality. so this shaun king guy, maybe he's a really good guy. He's just a white guy, is a dickhead. Well he's a white guy. Maybe he's a good guy. It could be an albino nigerian. I don't think he's that and I don't think so either. It looks just like his dad and his brother. Maybe he's a really good guy and this is just. He hangs out with the wrong people and as the wrong ideas in his

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       head and he's followed the wrong operating system to a in a logical perspective where the only way to disagree with is to call you a guy married to a home depot mexican or white supremacist. It's okay. I know you love your wife joe. Of course. I know like she doesn't work at home depot. She works at lowe's. I know. Listen, I've known you for a long time. You're the opposite of a racist. You're just not. Yeah. It's so fucked up. Like right now in 2070. It's like if you're truly not, you sound almost racist because you're like, you're like, if I'm going to make fun of the why's, that make it fun. Everybody knowing that. Like if you stand up and say, hey, you can't just openly make fun of all white people, that's fucking racist. Too stupid to do. I'm going to talk about, you know, your employment record.

Speaker 3:          02:23:12       Dude. I saw this lady's tweets and I did not retweet it. I thought about retweet and I'm like, I should fucking turn some fire on this bitch. Bitch, well thAt's what I'm for it. no doubt. Turn up the heat. Well, okay. I don't want to do. I don't want to be the guys dms get discovered and finds out up and secretly plotting against radical feminists, but this lady wrote, she wrote all white cisgendered. If you don't know what cis gender it is, it's not real, but with heterosexual men who are actually heterosexual today is the way to marginalize normal people. That's another mcdonald's. All white cis gendered men are shit unless proven otherwise. Okay honey, you might be a cut cut and I know you don't want to be a con, but you probably like, I don't. Maybe it's the geometry of your nasal passage to cheekbone, to chin structure.

Speaker 3:          02:24:04       Maybe you got crooked teeth, maybe you're on athletic and guys don't want to fuck you. Maybe you've dealt with all the wrong guy. maybe a perfect genetics. Maybe your brain is accelerated. Maybe you look at me like I'm stupid ape that I am. I don't know what the answer is, but you can't say that now have no repercussions for your actions. You can't say all white straight men who identify as men are shit until proven otherwise because that is crazy. Was racist, sexist, racist, homophobic, and it's stupid because if that was the case, if we were all shit, it would be a damn rape festival in the streets of every major city all over the world. If you really thought that we were all bad, let me tell you what all bad looks like. All bad looks like the world filled with coked up vikings just running through this tree mouth. Fucking everybody you've ever met. That's what men can do, and I'm not bragging, but that's what if you're. If you, if you have lingerie on and you can close your eyes and walk through a football field in front of a large crowd, one of them cheerleaders for like football and no one just tackles you and starts fucking you in front of when that is, because most people don't want that to happen.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       That's why. Well, I'm convinced that's why they keep coming at like white american dudes because we were some of the most chill guys name, but we've done some know. There's some fucked up shit, but they're, they're coming at us for a reason and I want to say us now, we don't have a rape culture though. We, we, we see a rapist. We go fuck that guy, but there is a lot of rape, but the problem is uNtil now there wasn't enough of an ability to express what written and on both sides, like some people call things raped. That's like, wait a minute window. You were both drunk and it was consensual, but It's rain say ruin. A dude's life falls for. That's happened and I had fattiest russell on. He was talking about the incident occidental college where a man and a woman it technically, they're both lIke over 18. They di, they got drunk, they decided to have sex. the girl called, the guy texted him, you have condoms. The whole deal. They agreed to get together and after the fact the girls friends decided that it was sexual assault because she was intoxicated, not even taking into account. They were both intoxicated, right? Both agreed and there was text messages back and forth.

Speaker 1:          02:26:30       Remorse does not equal rape. Having a bad experience. Percent. yeah. Both for the guy and the girl. I mean it's just like people fuck up and they make mistakes so you get it. You got to figure out what is and what isn't. And with thaddeus was talking about was that the girl went back to school with no repercussions, but the boy was sober. Life is over cross. there were two people who are attracted to each other who were exchanging text messages, who were influenced by the ideals and the, the, the ideology of all the people around them do it and how the media just like hits trump so hard that sometimes I'm like back off so I can mock them a little where it's like. Because I have that instinct of like, dude, I can't market guy. Everyone's fucking unfairly calling shit. he's not. But it's like, look at this guy who in occidental college, I don't remember his name, but look at this kid and then compare them to bill cosby.

Speaker 1:          02:27:25       Exactly, dude. Exactly. Real snakes. Let's call real rapist. Real rapist and call an 18 year old kid who was drunk or I don't know how old he is, maybe he's 20 and a 20 year old gIrl who's drunk. Call them kids, call them kids who it's not like this guy drugged her and duct taped her. Like let's, let's look at what it really. Is it really just two kids that got intoxicated and had intercourse with each other and then one of them felt bad. god damn. How many times do you feel bad about sex? Because a lot. Because It's almost like that, that, that, that thing of like the leprechaun, like he got caught the leprechaun. It's like an old parable. It's real short. I'm not going to drag on a parable, but like elaborate guy got caught and he's like, yeah, I'll give you the treasure.

Speaker 1:          02:28:07       It's under the tree with a ribbon on it. So he put the ribbon on all the trees. So now the ribbon doesn't mean shit. So everything's rape. Rape isn't rape. It's like if everything is racist, racism isn't racism. And you're like, you're now taking away our ability to identify predators and it's a dude's like us. It's like, I promise ladies, I promise you, if, if a guy breaks about rape will fuck that dude. It's like no one likes that guy. You're in a small enough community where people feel responsibility. That's the big problem. I read about this once. This is a phrase called diffusion of responsibility that happens in a large group of people that see something happen. Like there was a picture it genevieve, where she got killed in front of 40 people in New York city. Exactly, exactly. There was a picture of video rather from chicago.

Speaker 1:          02:28:52       Really recently. See if you can find jamie. We're a guy assaults a woman and he did it on a security camera. He had kicked her and knocked her out. I mean it was fucking awful. I don't know what led to it, but this guy punched her. And then I mean like still skillfully head kicked her. Like he took martial arts before. It's kod. She falls down and a bunch of people walk over and start filming her. She's as. So this is one that I, I don't think I retweeted because I think I'm not, I'm not entirely sure if I remember correctly, but I think I thought about retweet and I'm like, look, people don't need to see this. This is not something I want to promote. And support was someone wrote, this is like an episode of black mirror because this guy kicked this girl and instead of calling nine one one, these people are filming this girl while she's curled up in a. Did you find it this, it's.

Speaker 1:          02:29:45       I don't even know if I want you to find it this, but this girl curls up into a fetal position on the sidewalk and they're standing around her filming it. Well, I think, I think a big political divide isn't good evil, blah blah blah. It's population density. It's like cities like what we're talking about, all these monkeys going by each other. No one's eating each other's faces. You want a powerful government to keep it chill. But if you live in a place with a 40 minute police response time, it's about individuality. And that's when he started going more libertarian because it's like, well I have a gun in chickens, you know, versus like a big city where it's like, we need a powerful government to keep everyone relaxed. You know, you can't always rely on daddy, daddy, daddy, all dude. I've seen what happened. Fucking daddy doesn't do shit.

Speaker 1:          02:30:30       Daddy's a guy. Wanted a job being daddy. Yeah, that's what police daddy is, please. Daddy is. I mean sometimes you get great guys and sometimes you get fooled. It's like across the board. Like you might run into the best guy ever when you're shopping at walgreens and you might run into a fucking moron. You know? And exactly man. It's like a job needed to be filled. And you might've hit the perfect guy. And I love the way you describe govs. It's like it's the hardest job in the world, the hardest, the hardest soldier. And then you, you, you meet cops are like, god bless you man. You're the greatest. And anemia cops capture. I'm like, oh, you wanted power. Fuck you man. And it's like, it's, it's such a hard job. it's like teacher, you know, it's like all my family are teachers and it's like, oh, these are like, oh, throw away a job and it's going to be a teacher. It's like, oh, you're going to educate the youth and cops are going to keep us safe. Those are our fucking warrior heroes. You know it. You know what I mean? THis is a very

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       easy thing for me to say when I say I haven't had a bad experience with cops because I haven't, I really haven't. I mean I've had cops get mouthy with me before, but I've always said, no sir, thank you very much. So I've always been like, I've always like immediately try to diffuse the situation, but I'm a white guy. I, you know, I speak pretty calmly. I am a comedian, I'm an entertainer. A lot of them know me from the ufc at this point. It's almost like I'm out of the game right this point. Like cops run into me, like almost all cops are fans of the ufc. So if I run into a cop, the cops like, oh joe rogan, hey, what's up man? I'm like, hey, what's up man? And he realized like, oh, this is a guy, I'm not a terrorist. Like I'm not, I'm not a criminal.

Speaker 3:          02:32:01       I'm out of the, the, the confusion. Like he doesn't have to worry about me shooting him in the head. Oh totally. And shake his hand. I'm like, what's up brother? How you doing? Every. And they were all good. So I'm almost looking at it like a privileged outsider, but even when I was young, because, you know, my actual biological dad was a cop. I don't know him, I never knew him, knew him until I was like six got great genes and umbro but that. But I, when I was a kid I remember thinking like, what a crazy job like he has to go out and that is fear, fear, fear. It's also probably one of the reasons why that led him to be so fucked up, you know? And I never really like let him off the hook for that. But I saw a lot of dark shit from my actual biological dad when I was a little kid, like violent stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       And I was like, well, of course he's lit. He's a cop in New Jersey in 1967. Like how do you, how do you not be fucking violent? Like, totally, you're not going to live. You're not going to survive. You're, you're on the front line. And then going from that to a martial arts, from the time I was 15 years old, I was completely immersed in martial arts and I ran into a ton of cops and they were all like regular guys. And it made me think like, okay, this. When I think of a cop, I don't think of someone that I'm running into the trying to lock me up. I think at some poor guy who has this position in life where he's the guy who has to put the badge on and hold the gun and wear the stupid hat and stand in front of the criminal and go put your hands up.

Speaker 3:          02:33:29       I hope he doesn't get shot by a guy behind him that he doesn't know exists. And this is his life. Twenty four slash seven all day long comes home to his kids their sleep and he kisses him on the head and he thinks about the kid that he saw shot in the apartment building in the bronx to it is to think about that stuff. It's like I'm boy with a lot of cops where I live and a lot of them are troopers who were really well trained and they're like the coolest dudes ever. And they just, it's almost like the cops emotion is just like where it's like you just microwave your fucking baby dude. Yeah. You know, where it's like they see this shit and then like I do a benefits for like a tour de force and shit for like fallen officers and because I have so much compassion for that shit, man. It's like they are the watchdogs of our area. But then you get the bad seed or you get someone who makes her horrific mistake and justice isn't

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       given and that's why it's complicated. And you know, sometimes it's about like lawsuits where it's like, you know, someone fucks up and no one wants to admit they're wrong. And then the community that witnessed that, it's like they want their, like they would just want justice, but let's also, the punishment of fucking up is so extreme. Oh my god. Imagine if we bomb and we fucking gilligan back. You know, it's like one of our jokes bombs and someone fucking kid dies. Oh, that's why dude, cops deserve a lot of respect to do it. It's like it's a crazy job. It's a crazy job and you're dealing with pressure that most of us could never possibly imagine. And the life and death decisions that happen at the blink of an eye and you are responsible for those decisions for the rest of your life. And this is something that I talk about too much. I got to piss so bad. Jamie, can you keep a conversation with owen benjamin? I'm a lightweight. I don't know how to hold mY pee anymore. Bareback and malcolm gladwell's blink, blink book. Hold onto that thought. I will. Hey jamie. What's going down? What's going on, man? Man, he's about to pee out of his car and I

Speaker 7:          02:35:18       first time he's had to do this during a podcast. I think so. Rocktober fucked him up. Yeah. He never has to piss. Never. It's a three and a half hours or we're two and a half hours in to. I think this one's going to go for awhile. Yeah, I was going to get you guys some more ice if you needed it. So I fucking love rogan, man. He's such a good dude. What are you looking at? I had a couple of things pulled up to talk to you guys about talking to me about anything man. Uh, we were talking about south park before this. Two of the greatest show ever made. What's, what was goIng on? And you said the halloween episode just happen.

Speaker 5:          02:35:48       Yeah, it's about. No, It's a, you got to see the new south park. It's a, the, the dudes drink jack and smoke crack. That's not a, that's not a spoiler. It's the first act of the episode, but definitely check it out. I just think that sometimes people ask me where I, where I land politically and I usually just tell them south park because it's like, it's just as objective as you can probably get to the point where trey parker is like a fucking genius.

Speaker 7:          02:36:14       Awesome. Such a big fan. I wish he would come talk to us here one time.

Speaker 5:          02:36:19       Um, I got tripped. Tripped parker if you're listening, you did hire me once. A comic con in san diego. I don't know if you remember that. Uh, to host a thing. So why don't you coMe on the rogan podcast?

Speaker 7:          02:36:30       Yeah. They just had the new video game came out. I don't know if I was trying to explain that to you that you were talkIng about that, about taking not taking shit. The game's called fractured, but whole. Not butthole but the word, but in the w, h o l e o butthole. Exactly. Play on. It's profound, but you have to take a shit. And everybody's house all over the city to be mark making your mark

Speaker 5:          02:36:52       did. The thing I love about south park is that they go after everybody and that's why I have so Much respect for them, you know, they tried to go after islam as much as they want to after the mormons and that's why I'm lIke, you guys are great, you know, because it's all about just like no one gets a pass because that's when you create martyrs and shit. You know? I like doing podcasts way better, high and stoned and drunk too. This is fun. Way more fun.

Speaker 6:          02:37:17       Sober october is important. You know why just like running up a hill is important because it makes you appreciate naps, dude, in ways as I miss my weight fast. Yeah. You got to do chin ups, weight vests if you important. Champs more than pull ups a day. They're both the same to me. I just need pulling exercises. I mean there's a bunch of different ones. I actually have these things where the handle's rotate so we'll watch different ways, but it's just a matter of lifting your body weight. I think, uh, when I talked about movement before, it's one of the things that I got from this whole month of doing yoga and I knew I've been doing yoga pretty, um, pretty extensively or this guy's a switching back and forth. That's a good move. That tough. I to ask you about that. Yeah, it's hard to do. Yeah, it's hard.

Speaker 6:          02:38:04       It's hard to release. It's because you're essentially throwing yourself up and then exploding to catch yourself. I wonder if he whacks off like that. He says, why not? Why wouldn't you just keep switching? What I learned from the yoga thing though, and I've learned over the last few years, is like, it's a balance issue. Like what yoga does is balance everything out, not just balanced in terms of your ability to stand on one foot, but also balance the difference between the strength of your major muscle groups and then your tendons and your back and your core and the connecting things like your knees and your hips and all these things that you never taken into consideration. Like you don't really put a lot of emphasis on when you do other things. But when you do yoga, you realize, oh, my feet are giving out first, huh? Oh, like my hips are getting sore when I get into triangle pose, like, oh my, you know, and all that different stuff that you do that I'm like, it leads to like the strength and the strengthening of uh, ignored aspects of the entire system

Speaker 5:          02:39:05       and it also keeps you off your phone. Like I've been doing hot yoga with my wife and it's like, it's so hard and she's so good at it and like it's so funny because she'll do, we'll do hot yoga together like once a week, maybe twice a week and she'll get real horny and I'm getting real dehydrated. So it's like that. It's the most frustrating combination because it's like she gets really in touch with her body and she's so fucking hot and it's like awesome. But then I'm like, oh, I need about a gallon of water to make my cock. Like, awesome. Well just drink that gallon of water. I work on it. But I usually, I usually under bring water into the hot air.

Speaker 6:          02:39:39       The key to the the yoga is you got to drink the water beforehand. I'm usually hung over from the fucking pbrs. Yeah, you gotta drink, especially the hot yoga. You gotta drink. Try to drink like a leader, like a leader of water, like maybe an hour before and even more. I tried to drink. What is 64 ounces. How much does that have happened ago? Ounces to leaders. It's all confusing. God, I wish we would switch over to the metric system.

Speaker 5:          02:40:06       It's way better than english fucking king. That just screwed it for everybody. Yeah, I did it

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       with his foot, but we tried it again in the United States and I want to say the seventies or the eighties? Two point seven liters per day. Hold on. Ninety one out. Sixty four ounces of water per day. Recommended we consume 91 ounces. Okay, so two point seven liters is 91 ounces, so 64 liters is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two leaders. Oh yeah. One point eight. One point eight, nine liters. I think that's. That's what I bring to yoga. I bring a 64 ounce thing. I think you can get that in the before class, like if you could get up early and drink water with lemon in it, you'll have a better performance because there's literally like, like an. I see it a lot from guys that get dehydrated and try to make weight. You're, you're literally dealing with the electrical signals that go to your muscles are not going to fire and brain and brain.

Speaker 2:          02:41:06       Yeah. Like I got a camel pack and I crush it. Why mowing my lawn? Do you like a water bladder and with a straw? Yeah, I love it. Yeah, because they usually when I cross country skiing, because if I pull my hand out of my glove, my hand freezes that. Those are great for hiking too. Yeah. And hot. If you're at a hot or cold weather at high climates, at high altitudes, I'll get dehydrated shit. Like an aspen at the aspen comedy festival back in the day that day I'd have like three beers and be like, I'm king of the world. I did a show with lewis black and they had oxygen backstage for us. Really? I was like, louis, what the fuck is the oxygen for? I guess if one of us goes to horror, they slapped that fucking mask on your face. I was like, that's crazy to training up there.

Speaker 2:          02:41:51       That's like where the olympics train and shit sometimes. Yeah, because it's like a fucking dime for it. Anytime you can get it high altitude, it's just they, they say you should actually work out at low altitude but lived most of your life at high altitude. I'm at like 3000. That's good. Thousands. Definitely better than zero, you know? And um, if you can get accustomed to that, they say, I talked to a dude once when I lived in boulder and he told me that it takes three years for you to fully acclimate to a high altitude, but that once you do fully acclimate those like extreme, like cardiovascular benefits, well, but you get a sweet boner. Maybe not, maybe that's the trade off. You're going to run forever, but your dick is always recorded mast. That's what I miss about la is the beach runs and then the people like dudes like you and like just really brilliantly creative people and also the beach runs and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:42:45       It's the physical beauty ir. I don't miss that entertainment industry and the traffic was a different kind of beauty. Right? like you're in the mountains. It's so gorgeous. But I missed those. Like the oxygen's zero fucking feet above sea level just running. I, we used to live in marina del rey and that path I just listened to dan carlin just listen about fucking genghis khan is I just run with my fucking camel pack and that was a blast. That's, that's the thing about la that I think is really beautiful. It's like the amount of biomes like mountain, you know, there's some desert. This I'm a beach or ocean. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. But I think um, you know, if you have the ability to travel to all of them, you'll. Well I think you appreciated probably where you moved when you first moved there.

Speaker 2:          02:43:30       Right? Yeah. And I still love it though, man. Like now I'm like, I'm, I always miss it when I'm, when I'm away from it, but I know what you're saying. Yeah, it's easy, right? It's easy to get like real accustomed to what you see right in front of your face. Yeah. And like I have so many memories now with my family there and my chicken just giving me food everyday. They just keep shooting out eggs and wolves up there either. Right? We got coyotes and I've learned a lot about guide. Who's from your podcast? Dan flores. Do you kill them? They, they multiple, either like gremlins. You can't kill coyotes. So actually the worst thing you can do. Well, the things spread their range to me. Uh, there's a type of cat phisher fisher's fisher cats to keep jacking my shit. And uh, foxes and raccoons are my enemies.

Speaker 2:          02:44:13       Coyote is not so much. Coyotes will get a chicken if they can, but coyotes are smart. There are oddly clever, like they figured out how to avoid people. You know, one of the things that I found most fascinating about dan flores book, iod America was the mythology that the native americans had about coyotes, that the coyote who was essentially a god and the kid was a god that was watching over you, like watching what you did all the time, constantly judging you and try. It was really weird. Like the native american and some tribes, their interpretation of what a coyote was, it was really fast. I mean, they're pretty powerful if like if they jack your chickens, like sometimes like we were talking about empathy, like what's it like to live a different life? I'm like, what if I needed these chickens? Like I got more chickens but we had one chicken holocaust and I'm like, we're fucked now.

Speaker 2:          02:45:04       Imagine if that was like the winter and like the chickens are gone. It's like what do we eat? But here's the thing, you weren't fucked. But the coyote is like, this is. I had a weird come to jesus moment when it came to coyotes when a coyote stole one of my chickens and I watched her talking about a tricky trick. My dog called is a honeybee. Does Johnny Cash? Johnny cash is my mass mast if and Johnny Cash is a tank. This is how fucked up Johnny Cash Johnny Cash got into the chicken coop just like honey. A couple of months ago, just a couple of months ago, Johnny Cash tore through the chicken wire with his paws and got in and it was a chicken holocaust in there. Killed. Who's eating them? Yeah, he killed like four chickens in one setting. It was a disaster and I saw him in my underwear.

Speaker 2:          02:45:49       I went outside. I was like looked out the window and I looked. I saw the fuck and I ran downstairs in my underwear, yanked him out of the chicken coop. I pick them up and throw him outside. He's fucking 12. He's an old man. Good for him. But he's still getting after it. Just getting that. Did you do like name your chickens and get bumbling? Well, I don't but my wife fucking clunky and fucking meredith and shit. Prince's petunia princess between you got jacked by Johnny Cash a little fyi. Dubai what names? Like deer and shit, like one spot. And I'm like, I think my brother wants to kill spot dude. Fuck, spot up. Don't do that. You know? But that's, that's the thing. It's like I, if they were in my neighborhood I would, I would, I would probably name them too, but I'm on the road a lot and that's what I know she misses me when she's like, oh here comes david.

Speaker 2:          02:46:39       I'm like the raccoon, raccoon. It's always just a fucking animal spot. Might have to go. David might ask to go yet because my brother's getting into hunting now and like I think he wants to kill spot. So you have taught you, you talked about it before, the podcast that you thought about actually getting into hunting yourself, but you don't want to wound down. It has to be a quick kill because I would love to hunt and, and my wife wants me to hide because uh, because my uncle hunts a lot and whenever we stay with him he's always got like pheasant and shit and like it gets me pretty jacked up like natural animals. I think there is some juice in it. It's like there's something different. There's something going on. Does anybody around you hunt and is willing to take you? And literally everybody didn't want to mentor you.

Speaker 2:          02:47:24       Fuck yeah. All you have to do is learn how to shoot a rifle. Right? And here's the mean, there's a lot you could read about shooting, um, but you, you have to get someone who sets up the scope correctly, sets up the rifle correctly, and then you just have to. Someone have someone teach you the proper form and how to just only move your finger. Just pull, pull, pull, pull, pull, pull and get a surprise shot. You can't go. You try to shoot because you'll flinch. And the, a minor movement left or right over 100 yards could equal. It can be the difference between a lethal shot and shooting an animal in the butt and anybody who's shot a rifle including me has done that before. It's not good. And we shoot a lot, you know like oh well we have will shoot like ar air fifteens and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:48:10       Like in the we'll, we'll get a nice section of land. Like my brother has 40 acres in this beautiful area and it's like. And by the way, it's so cheap up there, dude. You can get an acre for like 800 bucks, you know, and you just get this, this, you can wait. You can get an acre of land for 800 bucks and it's the most beautiful shit you've ever seen. Is it a direct flights? There's a, there's a airport and fucking sarah, I'm not going name. You have to fly like you have to fly like syracuse or some shit and then take a puddle jumper that killed somebody. Some lethal. There's some weeds. Flights like body holidays. There's enough, there's enough like super wealthy people there that we have like a pretty legit airport and this little area because it's a. But they fly their own jets in those fuckers.

Speaker 2:          02:48:54       They do, they fly their private jets into your little funky town and then they just sit there and then we are always like, well, you pay us to hunt for you. But dude, you do like it up there. My brother's like, dude wants to hunt because it's like, how many animals do you have up there? What kind of animals? We have moose, deer. It's probably hard to get a moose tag though right now. It's not that hard. It's hard to miss. Yeah, they're talking about shooting a house. They're like an ancient logan animal man. It's so crazy looking and they're fucking vicious. Oh, well they do. They are rare in the deer family. Like all deer will fuck you up if they have to. Especially when they're in rut. They're just like, yeah, but a moose will try to fuck you up. There's a difference because they're constantly dealing with grizzly bears and brown bears and they can fuck you up. They can. Their big dude. I saw him once up there and it was like. It was like a come to jesus moment. I'm like, oh, I'm not, I'm a guest in this area. Dude. I shot one that was young. He was like, he had like a little fork on the left and the fork in the right and each one of his legs was over 100 pounds. I had a scoop his leg up and throw it over my shoulder bigger than alwan.

Speaker 2:          02:50:03       It's almost like a stone in england where it's like how many ali wongs way. There's a. I did a cover for peterson's hunting magazine and on the cover I'm holding a moose leg over my shoulder and it's a crazy picture. Like you look at how big that fucking leg is and that's not a big moose. The moose that I shot was only like maybe 900 pounds. It was fairly small for a moose, but that's like the entire offensive line of the dallas cowboys. Yeah, right there. That's awesome. That moose would've fucked me up. Like there's not a way in hell you could have stopped. That moves from stomping a hole in your chest. Yeah, and they want to. It's like a lot of prey animals get is almost as vicious as the predators. Uh, even though I don't feel as much empathy for the prior, so like if I wounded a fucking cat, yeah, it'd be like, yeah, you learn your lesson brow.

Speaker 2:          02:50:57       Like my, my brother recently hit A raccoon with a pitchfork and lived. And uh, I didn't feel bad at all. Well he lived as far as you know. Yeah, he's definitely dead now. But that's happens. come in the henhouse definitely had some like leakage. Yeah. That was the man that was the weinsteins coming in and trying to get our hands. we fucking stabbed his ass. No, he was more ethical. Like what he's doing, he's just trying to eat. He just found a way to eat and we starve and he's in that hardscrabble life of the wilderness and there's, there's a lot of food up there. Like it's a beautiful area. There's no supermarkets for raccoons now they just got to do. They have a whole foods recommends up there. So a lot of chemo for raccoons. Keen was young. Soy isolate. I love pea protein. Does this, does that. Give you boobs too much soy. You you would know that shit. It's like I'm extraordinary amounts. I think it's one of those things where people like really over exaggerate the impact of it to emphasize the femininity of going vegan. Right. Her. I don't think it really makes you a woman, but I think that, you know guys like, hey, and you could just eat bison duke good harder.

Speaker 2:          02:52:21       You start planting flowers. So lactating. Yeah. You start speed walking to bisons. Good shit. Good shit. They were almost gone. Does soi really caused man boobs? Let's find out where on a website is it's fitness. It's just never trust doctors with dr. Name now. Dr stacy. Legit. He's legit. He's a friend of mine who's on sirius satellite radio. I got to get him on, man. He's supposed to be on a million times. We never. We never put it together. Dr steve. Let's make it happen. That you're steve mann. Dr steve focuses on very bizarre venereal diseases. He talks about them in depth. You're like, wait, what? Huh? like syphilis. you can die from that. Like is there ones we don't know about? Not yet, but for sure they're coming. It sounds like there was no herpes and all of a sudden there was herpes and that's it.

Speaker 2:          02:53:13       That's why I like being married. It's like I don't have to worry about that shit now. So think you don't. What about toilet seats? That's. That's a good point. What about sneezing and I like to whack off on toilet seats. What about what if plants fight back like a fucking shama lama. Ding dong that shit. That's what I'm saying. Like what if they fight back? We whack off on him and weinstein. Imagine if, if a weinstein's bars didn't just extend to him sexually abusing actresses, but that his calm when harvey shot loads on those branches, that does branches like morphed because of the. The vile hatred for the female organism was in his dna and those, those trees like found human babies and female babies and smothered him to death. yeah, just started. Harvey's come. It's start producing movies. It's like produced by a is harvey is what it was like.

Speaker 2:          02:54:09       His ges contacted the bark of the tree and created the new plague. Whoa. It's totally legit. Possible. Who the fuck knows what causes the plague? I was reading something about the black death is spreading because people like Arizona or some shit, right? No, no. It was somewhere in some place I'm never going to visit, and it was. They were talking indie or some shit. They were talking about how there's a problem with a culture where people pull the bodies out of the ground, the zoom, the bodies, and we're dancing around them and it was literally causing the black death display. Dancing with death. Madagascar. Plague is spreading because relatives are digging up their black death corpses and dancing as part of an ancient fama de haan a ritual. I mean that's commitment to dance. That's commitment to stupidity. where if someone's like, oh, you're gonna die if you do that. It's like, no, I fucking loved dancing. Did

Speaker 7:          02:55:04       the website from the sun. Oh, it's not real because this unreal or the males not real. One of them was not really both. I think they both have questionable. They're not the onion, right? They're not done, so they're not. They're not honorable. more. I think like that. The fake old fake news thing from the grocery store that you'd always see, oh wait, that kind of thing. Almost like newsy is almost like legit news at this point. What is fake news and what is real news anymore? I have no idea. It's almost like the opium wars where it's like we're just flooded with fucking info at this point, which said jeremy. So that's what those hearings are about to. I was just reading. There's something tim cook gave a talk this afternoon. The apple guy? Yeah, based off of the. He said is that the fake news spreading is probably the bigger problem than the russian ads.

Speaker 7:          02:55:46       He says the ads is probably like a point one percent of the actual problem and the ability for fake news to spread, manipulate people through social media is problems one through 10 and you can be fixed. It's a judge that that was almost like a martin luther catholic church thing. It's like, oh no, no, no. It's not. Who gets to judge. It's whether or not it's fake. Like concentrating on who the person is that gets the judge. That's not helping anybody, but what? What's fake and what's not fake? There's gotta be a way to differentiate. This should be like a pregnancy test

Speaker 2:          02:56:17       for stories plus or minus and you're like, oh mine. It says that for a second. Before you tell me this story. I want you to lick this piece of paper is mother fucker. That's hilarious. What does it say where there is

Speaker 7:          02:56:30       cook? Apple ceo says that, scroll up. There's a greater issue than russian. Facebook didn't have that big hearing going on today and yesterday. Were there people from facebook, twitter. Why does everybody have to be number one? Why does it have to be the number one problem?

Speaker 2:          02:56:51       Number one problem is Russia is not ads. It's fake news. Why is there a goddamn competition between what sucks the most listened to me, tim cook, they both suck. The ads suck. The stories that are fake, stuck. Everything sucks. Stop making it about what? Woo. The number one problem is. Not that it's trends. Babies. No, no. Yeah. Like why kid? Multiple things sucks. Why don't we have a contest? What is there a top 10 list of the suckiest things about life. how about things? Just suck. Yeah, like me and my bro, you know, a fortune, a comedian, fortune. Very funny. Oh, she's, she's a, she's a buddy of mine and we like, we'll talk on twitter. She's like, who offer dissenting opinion, but we're like buds. So like we go back and forth and I was like ripping on some fucking wine scene type psycho.

Speaker 2:          02:57:46       And she was like, yeah, but what about the fact trump did this? I'm like, yeah, both sucks. Both suck. Like the hold line in the sand. Like you only can fucking say one thing sucks is the end of our civilization. And I think the one good thing, the time. Wait a minute. What did I read? I read a headline. I didn't read the story, but that weinstein said that this happened to him to change humanity. See if we could find that. He might've been. That's a fucking angle. It's good angle. If that's a great buddy. And we were doing mushrooms together. I was, listen to me bro. You just handle this right? Good. It's a good thing that you jerked on that fight. Not that part. The fight. The most forgivable part. The part, yeah, that's uh, he didn't say that. Who said it? It's a point of weinstein.

Speaker 2:          02:58:34       Pals said that his pals. What? Okay. Weinstein tells pals. Oh, there you go. Jamie. Hey. Well, I mean this is secondhand information. He wasn'T loaded. he tells pals is a scandal happens so he could change the world. That's what I said. So I'll make it larger. It's the hero's journey for perverts. It says disgraced. Harvey weinstein has been telling what friends he has left. If there's a bigger reason that he's embroiled in the ever wielding a widening sexual harassment scandal to change the world. Sources tell page six. I hate when they say sources say he's a savior. A hollywood insider says, okay, this is all bullshit. Every swing, but it's an interesting angle. So let's keep going. A source adds that. The pervy wow. That's rude. Former weinstein.

Speaker 2:          02:59:27       Miramax, miramax. Matcher. What's? Some might have left out a word or the letter word? Miramax. Marcher. Mocker. I don't know. Oh, like big mock. Mock her. Is that like a. You never heard it used acidic word big. I know there's like big maka, but I don't think it's my her person who gets things done. Yeah, it is big monster. Nice yiddish. There we go. Has been telling a confidence that he was born to take the fall for his behavior in order to change the world. He is resigned to his punishment as a martyr for social change. But here's the thing, a comment. A rep for weinstein commented. That's absurd. it is absurd. But. But here's the thing. I think that's true. I don't think that there's like some crazy fucking destiny that he has the golden ring and he was supposed to take the fall, but through his own folly, through his own greedy fat chubby dick trying to pump his ineffective lowe's into the mouths of tens, he really is going to change the world. Yeah, but he doesn't get to say it though, like the other people have to feel it. I don't know if he did. It's, it's, it's one of these insiders that don't exist. They Might've been real, but they might've been fake. Jamie, what do you do if you were a writer, and I'm not saying this person did that, you could have made that quote up and just wrote an article, but of course juicy headline that gets talked about podcasts.

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       Sources could be like your horses. I mean that was a. I mean I hate to exonerate him, but trump has said that many times about some of the stores. Is it the stories written about him? They keep saying according to sources, he's like, you don't have any sources. The sources do need to be protected for journalists. You're right, so is a really weird sort of gray area. You're right. Yeah, I mean there's. There's only one way that someone's going to give you information that could possibly threatened their life if they are. There's no financial benefit. No. No societal benefit for them. They have to be anonymous. Right. We've always been. That was one of the main problems that I had with the obama administration. You know, people sort of let them slide on that, but it was one of the worst with whistle ever. There was a part of the hope and change website, a part of the hope and change website that was later redacted or a deleted was that they were talking about expanding protection for whistleblowers who are exposing someone breaking the law, which is exactly what edward snowden did.

Speaker 5:          03:02:09       Yeah. That, like obama trick me, he tricked the trick me, man. I've already checked himself $2, like this is going to unite the races of America and he's going to be transparent and he's such a good speaker. He's made me cry like literally with hope and then I see what the, what he's, what he does. And I'm like, dude, you know, seventy seven cents is bullshit man. And it's like those little things where I'm like, what that is. Oh the uh, they say the wage gap between men and women is seventy seven cents on the dollar. And he said that publicly, publicly. Right? And it's one thing if it's buzzfeed, it's the president of United States and that is completely bullshit. It's been debunked by the female president of harvard. Like this is not reality at all. It's like. And so when I see claim what it really is though, okay, it really is more like a four cents. Maybe it's uh, uh, they, they don't include a factors such as quitting for having a children or dangerous jobs or all this shit that's just a rough average. But if you look at this man and a woman with the same job for the same amount of years with the same education, it's basically the same. It's very close

Speaker 6:          03:03:16       jobs. A man makes more and they have attributed that, although there's no real way to tell, but they, uh, they believed that's attributable to man is more aggressive in negotiating his initial salary total and subsequent raises.

Speaker 5:          03:03:32       And, and the, the interesting thing is women are better at negotiating for other people. Like I've had female female agents that are like, vicious and awesome because they're like, it's almost like their baby cops where they're like, no, they deserve more. That's my baby. But for themselves point. Yeah, for themselves. They're not as alpha because I think their attractiveness isn't bret weinstein shit where it's like, their attractiveness is. So given that they don't have to, like most men didn't fucking procreate for most of human civilization, so we're always just trying to be like, look dude, I got a car, you know, that's an interesting point because like if you have a view like there's two girls and one girl is like kind of gross and overweight and the other girl is really pretty. The gross overweight girl will protect that pretty girl, like a fucking german shepherd.

Speaker 5:          03:04:22       Totally shielded, but that the gross overweight girl will fuck. And then tire bus load of willing men of course. yeah. Like men are like super excited about her. All the standards get out the window. She has a couple of shots of vodka and she's like fucking taking her bra off as she's walking through those ills. Expanding school bus doors for us though, tourists, they call desert roses where it's like, you know, a is a 10, but that doesn't happen the other way. Like if, if there's a bunch of women on a desert island, there's some fucking weinstein with no movie credentials, they don't read them. They can just be like, dude, we can just hang out with each other and just kind of cuddle and fuck anybody. RighT. But like dudes are like as low as it goes, we will potentially meet that standard and that's. And that's why it's like men can highly spa, get specific with their skillset, but we're more susceptible to brain damage.

Speaker 5:          03:05:25       But it's interesting. We're talking about like a woman protecting that other woman. Oh, 100 percent. Like I do a bit about how women are socialist mentor capital. That's where it's like women, it's like, oh, she's having a bad night. We all have to go home, you know, a linker tiers. Ice cream man. Or like he's been a buzzkill fucking cut the week. Yeah. And the opposite is true. We have to go home for debbie. Yeah. But the opposite is true. Where it's like he's the fastest. So it's like he's the funniest. Let's make him king. And women are like, she has herpes tell everyone or. No, she's the, she's the prettiest. Everyone she has herpes. It's the tallest nail gets hammered down because in a galitary in societies like the gatherers have to be like the same and the hunters value skill, so it's like, can you shut your mouth and shoot a fucking gun?

Speaker 5:          03:06:06       Great. You're in versus like berry picking there. Like everyone's great. Right? Let's share. Babies are shared berries. I don't want to talk shit about debbie. I just realized while drunk. you're definitely drunk. Yeah, but the point I made is still valid. The were good for awhile, but he didn't know how to get off the horse. I said babies instead of berries. That happens, man. You get to a certain point in your free wall and you're like, oh my god. I'm like skiing down a hill that I. I don't know how to stop it. I just started winging it. We've done enough. This is three hours and 20 minutes, right? How many minutes? Sweet. Dude. It's been a blast. I love you man. I love you too buddy. Matt, we did this. He did. I'm glad I was with you for the first alcohol and the first marijuana hadn't 31 days and I'm here to tell you so brighty as fucking highly underrated and

Speaker 6:          03:06:56       overrated at the same time. It's overrated when it comes to podcasts. That's good. Good. Take a month off. I like it. It's respect. Respect. I feel good about it. I'm excited. I'm good to be back on the horse. She take them on twitter to show her fucking willpower. No, that's not worth it. Well, you have to promote gigs. I think a month off interacting with people. It's not the worst idea in the world. Just send some love out there and then just walk away, you know? But do send some good positive feelings. Don't worry about being sappy. Why? Why is sincerity sappy like what happened? Well, are we so fucking cynical that someone can say, can't say much loved everybody. Oh, good pussy. Sincerity became sappy somewhere along the line. Let's turn that around. Turn it around. Let's turn it around and all you bitches out there that think that all white cisgendered men are shit. fuck that shit. I pray for you to get some good dick. Good, good friends. And so I'm happy
