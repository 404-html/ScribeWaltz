Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay, boom, and we're live with joy ideas and Tj English. Uh, Joey turned me onto you a long time ago. Mr English. Uh, he gave me a copy of the westies right? What year was that? Ninety eight. Ninety nine. Long time ago. He gave me that book. It's fantastic. Really fascinating stuff. First Book I published wasn't really westies yeah, 1990. How'd you guys find out? I'd be each other. He wrote book

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       book. A friend of mine turned me onto a book name Havana Nocturne that was a small book of fascinating read and I was just blown away by him and I went to a party one night and there was a literary agent, Stan and I go, you fucking guys read the van like during like an option that I was like, that's fucking, that's going to be a great book with just, uh, it broke down the, the uh, how Fidel took over it from three different cities, how it was going down in three different categories. And then I heard that he was writing a book about West New York and you city Cubans where I grew up and I emailed him and I told him who I was, that my mother had a bar and I grew up in that shit and he hit me back and we became friends. He came to a show and

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       yeah. Joe, he reached out to me, you know, unfortunately when I was just about finishing this book, so I had done most of the work and it was down on paper, but it was a trip. It was like he was, he was like a character who walked out of the book and I wished I'd met him earlier because I hadn't met too many characters like him. You need city's amazing place. I don't think people realize that it's one of those little enclaves happens to be Cuban. It's like a Mafia neighborhood, but it was Cubans, not Italians or it was like hell's kitchen, which I wrote about in the Westies, which was an Irish neighborhood, very intense neighborhood. A high premium on loyalty. I'm young males running loyalty games on each other all the time from the age of six, so we didn't know how far you'll go turn this sucker up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       How far? How far will you go for me? Uh, you know, uh, what are you willing to do for me in the case of Hell's kitchen in the westies it was cut up bodies was not only would you kill somebody for me, but will you make the potty disappear? And they tested each other with, with the cutting up of the bodies and union city. A lot of it was, was political. Some of it was political. How antifa Idella you, how badly do you want to kill, you know, Fidel and help us reclaim our last homeland. That was kind of behind a lot of things. It wasn't spoken about a lot, but it was sort of the hidden motivation. Westies was a really fantastic book. Like you, you went deep into that whole sort of sub scene. You know, it's a, it's a very interesting crime infested area.

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       Well, what, what I try to do with these books is to tell the macro story. The larger historical sociopolitical story and then get intimate and tell the interpersonal stories between the characters that actually lived this story. That's a challenge. You've got to find people who are willing to talk to you and share information with you that they've kept quiet probably most of their lives and then you get at the interpersonal stuff because these stories really are just human beings caught up in something that's bigger than them. And how long when you, when you're writing a book like the corporation, which is your new book or Westies are any of your books, how much time do you spend doing the research and how much time do you spend actually writing the book, uh, takes about three years to do these books on average and an n two of those years is research probably.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Wow. Yeah. So you do bring this to the Book Company, the publisher and you say, Hey, this is what I want to write a book. You do a proposal and I do very, very detailed proposals for the corporation. I did a proposal, it was 125 pages long and it's a chapter by chapter breakdown. It's almost like a condensed version of the book and you get more money from a publisher that way as an advance because you're showing them the whole thing practically. They can see the finished product almost. And also, you know the movie interests. There was movie interest in this one, the corporation based on that, on that proposal. Interesting. Yeah. It was option to, based on that proposal before I even started writing the book. Real. Yeah. So what is the corporation about the corporation, the story of the Cuban American organized crime organization that began in the mid 19 sixties and existed all the way to the end of the century and it was led by this mobster named Jose Miguel battle, who was kind of a legendary figure in Cuban American circles because he was a hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Speaker 1:          00:05:00       The, uh, the attempt to reclaim Cuba take back Cuba, the invasion in 1961, which was a disaster for everyone involved, battle wound up in prison along with the rest of the brigade. And when he got out and came back to the US, he was determined to get Castro and take back Cuba. So he set up this criminal thing and it was based on a one racket primarily Bolita the number, the lottery, the illegal lottery for the lottery was illegal. It was illegal and it was controlled by organized crime. And it was a huge moneymaker, big money maker for the mob going back to the 19 twenties. Everyone. That's the number of little old ladies, but the number of priests, cops, you know, you can bet a nickel, you can bet a dime. You can bet $10,000, hugely profitable for whoever controls and organizes it. Well, the Cubans controlled and organized it on the eastern coast of the United States from New Jersey and New York all the way down to Miami.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       And the guy who controlled it was battle and he became legendary. Based on that, they controlled the whole number system because I know there's a lot of Italians that were involved. They went to the Mafia. One of the first things battle. That battle had been a cop of ice cop in Havana in the 19 fifties. During the. For the turnover. Yeah. During the era when the mob joey was talking about Havana Nocturne. That's what that book was about. The era of the mob in Havana in the fifties. Meyer Lansky Santa traffic content and how they controlled that until Castro came along and spoiled the party and the revolution happened and they got chased out of their battle. Had been a vice cop in Havana during those years. And he knew all those, uh, high ranking mobsters in effect. He was a bag man who delivered money from the Skimm at the casinos in Havana to the presidential palace.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       So battle knew how the world went round and he made those connections. And when he finally gets to the US and wants to start his own thing, first thing he does is go to Santa Traffic. Content says, can you make the proper introductions for me? Profit content introduces him to fat Tony Salerno in New York City who controls the numbers racket for all five families and battle says, look, things are changing in Cuba over the next couple of decades. You're going to have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans coming to live in the United States. They all bet the number. That's a huge market. If you let me take over this thing and organize it, you will get a piece of, you will get your piece of everything. And the Mafia said yes. And so the Cubans took over and they control everything. I mean, in New York City in the seventies and eighties, there were probably 200 to 300 belita spots where you could go bet the number.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       That's the Cubans call it bullying a little ball. And uh, so they controlled it and they took care of the mafia and everybody was got fat and happy for awhile until it turned bad and they started killing each other. Now, when Joey, when you heard about this book, this is something that you were very intimately involved in when you were a kid. Very, you know, I come on your show and I'll tell you, there's 100 stories I could tell you there's a thousand dollars I can't. And when he told, when I read the thesis for this book, I just knew, I just fucking know, you know, I grew up in numbers when I went to Catholic school on Saturdays when I came home on Fridays and Saturdays at the age of Eight, I was sent to different locations in the city, the bronx, Brooklyn and I will make $50 going to the errands, running numbers. Go tell this guy. The first number of the day is to, you know. So I grew up in it. I grew up in a house where the bookie would call my mother by 3:00 and go, what's the numbers for the day? And My mother would give him a fucking laundry list, you know. And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       it's very interesting in this book he also covers the mysticism of the number. So if I'm at your house and your daughter walks in with a hockey shirt and her number is 13, I'll look at you and go, Joe, give me a number from zero to nine five and pick up the phone. I bet. Five, 13. If I look out my window and the cop cars is five. Oh six. I put $5 on five or six. If I have a dream about an eagle, when I go down to the belief that spot, there's books that they sell, books or dreams. And I take that book and I look up Eagle Eagles number eight. I pay eight. 13. It's, you know, you, you were mentioning a couple months ago that your grandmother took numbers. Grandmother was Sicilian. Sicilian people have the same, uh, everyday they live today's today. Yesterday's the day.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       Joe Rohde. Yup. Today's the day. I'm hitting the number. I'm not getting. You know, she talks about that dream, that dream. Again, we're going back with the immigrant mentality. But those three numbers today, if God wants, if God is real, what he says, it's true. Might number's gonna come out today. One is my ship going to come in that you work a plain Jane dream you wrote, you're a blue collar person and on the way home, every day by 3:30 you put the number and that's it. That's what you do. Something to believe in. Something believe in numerology and with q and a. It was very mystical. It was tied into a dreams and belief. The idea was you bet the number and you try to make your dreams come true. That's literally what you're doing. You're trying to make your dreams come true, and the belief that guides the bullied thoreau's the ones who control it there, the dream makers, they're the guys who are making it possible for your dreams to come true.

Speaker 2:          00:10:51       So they had tremendous stature in the community community. Every dream solver. So you work t j's Jose battle and you're an independent booking. Your job is to sit at a bar and lounge in western New York from 10 to three drinking and all day long people come in and go, Joe, give me five slash 17, $3. Give me three. Oh, three one doll at 3:00, 3:30 a number comes up. If that number wins, if I give you $500, you get $3,000 from battle. You give me 2,500 so you make $500 off the top. And then I tip. Yet, the thing that battle did was he didn't take 10 points. He let you run your independent action unless you called it in to him, you know, it's very, you'll watch the movie. Uh, uh, what's smooth Mickey Rourke and the train these people a year, the Dragon, great fucking movie, great movie.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       When he says, you know, for years the Chinese will bring it into heroin and they were selling it to the Italians, you know, $50,000 investment to make you $500,000. Chinese weren't saying that like they weren't seeing that. Why? Because they didn't have, they couldn't bring it out, they couldn't sell it. Black people and Spanish people bitch slap them to death. So the same thing happened with Bolita Fat Tony Salerno knew that he had a big thing coming with the Cubans. The Cubans want to put a bedroom with Cubans. Hm. Yeah. Do you understand the Italians? They want to put a bedroom with Italians, Puerto Ricans. They want to put a better than with a Puerto Rican. It's not a big thing. That was with the numbers. It was that there was a community thing. Let's talk about the numbers. Like the lottery is some sort of a government funded thing and it seems like it's got a lot of red tape and official and there's no wiggle room. The, the numbers seemed to be closer to like the community,

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       especially with Latinos. Especially with lucky. Yeah. It was the, in some ways the core of the community, the number of spots where everybody would hang out. You go to here, the neighborhood lobola and the gossip in the streets. He'd go there and here in the neighborhood gossip. Uh, yeah. And, and it was never meant to be violent back in Cuba. Belita was not violent. It was illegal, but it wasn't violent and it turned very violent in the United States. The corporation became so profitable. I mean, we're talking about millions of dollars on a monthly basis, billions of dollars over the course of the life of this organization, billions of dollars more than they could. The artist thing they had was what to do with the money. I mean, they, they, they would literally strap money to people to as money couriers to try to get it out of the country to get it into getting into offshore bank accounts and launder the money.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       They had more money than they knew what it was. A license to print money, which hugely profitable. That's what made it violent. Then you started having gangsters vying for territory, territorial disputes, greed, greed took over. And it got very ugly nose. This between Cubans, between Cubans, between the Cubans and the Italians. See, this guy battle was very charismatic leader, uh, with some great leadership qualities. He'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs invasion. He saved some guys lives. Um, when I first heard that story, I didn't. I said, I got to verify that maybe this is just the story I got told about himself to burnish his legend. So I found the guys that he saved and I found the guys, two brothers who went with him to save that, the guys that he saved and I went to Cuba, to the Bay of pigs to the exact location where he saved these guys to verify this story.

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       And it was absolutely true. He and in an act of incredible heroism, he saved the life of a number of his platoon members. And so that was his reputation. From then on, he was revered in the community. He was a hero and people defended him even even when it turned ugly. And he became a ruthless boss who was killing people left and right. He had his defenders because of his legend as a hero in the community. And so the power that he had. But he also had this, uh, joey and I were talking about this tubing tab. This Latinos have this. Everybody has it, but Cubans have a desire for revenge. This guy, you know, the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt that revenge to get revenge against Castro. And they were humiliated by that process. And a lot of the guys from that generation had an unfinished agenda for revenge.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       So if you wrong this guy battle in any way he was going to get you, even if it took years and years of calculation. I mean, there are stories in the book about this one guy who killed his brother named Pilou. He took, it took nine years and 12 attempts before they finally killed this guy polluted. They shot him in his hospital. He was in the hospital, they shot him, had an assassin dressed up as a male nurse and go into the hospital and shoot him between the eyes because there had been so many failed attempts. They weren't going to fail this time. And that's embattled for 12 years. I took night and kissed his ass. No, never caught him. No, no bank disappeared. And I believe the assassin got killed later because he was talking about it, having done it. And so battle had him killed. Wow. Yeah. So that the revenge motive, the revenge motive Kinda drove battle off the deep end. And uh, somewhere along the line he broke bad, so to speak. I mean, I don't know if he was ever good and had to break bad, but he started doing internal killings that really had nothing to do about business. They're all about revenge. Well, this is a theme that happens a lot with organized crime people. Right? It's like they just get a taste of killing

Speaker 2:          00:16:58       people and it becomes easier and easier. And then that was the thing about murder machine, right? About Roy Demeo. Yeah. It just was killing people. Nothing to it. After awhile. And that's another book you gave me. I was reading all those books on the road because I was auditioning for so many Italian roles. I never really knew the history of it, so I was just trying to read all those books just so when I went in I had an idea of what these characters and who they were. I saw them growing up. I saw these guys, you know, growing up, I just didn't. The interesting thing about this book was talking to the Bay of Pacers that they knew that they were coming, like for dumb, no common. He put Bob wire or something and his quarterly, the soldiers all slashed their feet as they were landing. There was four battalions. Uh, I

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       think the 250, you know what happened when they landed, there were Klieg lights set up on the beach. Yeah. They knew that. They landed, they flipped the lights on and it lit it up like a movie set. Right? When these guys landed Jesus, they got slaughtered, they got slaughtered, and they felt they'd been betrayed by Kennedy, you know, that they were supposed to be air cover and the air cover never came. And why was that? Because Kennedy, Kennedy always had this operation was started by the Eisenhower Administration. And the CIA was a CIA operation. Kennedy inherited it and he never really. He always had mixed feelings about it. I mean, it was illegal. It was a, uh, an illegal secret, covert operation and attempt to overthrow a government. It would have been seen as an illegal activity, the eyes of the world to do it. So Kennedy was trying to do it so it could be done in such a way that it could never blow back on his administration, and so he, he withheld air cover at a crucial point in that, in that war lasted three days and they got slaughtered and they got in, they got imprisoned and they had a lot of resentment towards Kennedy.

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       I mean, I go into the book though a little bit about the Kennedy assassination and the belief that a lot of that, a handful of those Cubans may have been involved in the Kennedy assassination along with the Italians, with the mob because they were working hand in hand with the CIA. Yeah. That was one of the leading conspiracies outside of the CIA killing him and even the CIA killing him was a part of the bay, the Bay of pigs conspiracy and also the. The idea that he wanted to disband the CIA. There was a really interesting article recently. There was dismissing almost every single conspiracy theory about the Kennedy assassination. They said, except the CIA one, there's legitimate possibilities that the CIO. Well, you can bet your ass that if the CIA was involved in Cubans orange. Now let me ask something in the book. You speak about Fidel's Mr.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       Yeah. He got one with her at this particular one. Merita. She had gone to New Orleans or the Dallas. My Retail Lorena. This is very interesting, notorious figure. She had a child with him, uh, and had an abortion and didn't have the child. She got pregnant with Fidel. In fact, Castro admitted as much. She got pregnant with Castro. She had a, she had an abortion and then the CIA used her to try to assassinate Castro. She had was supposed to slip him a pill and she put it in her face cream and the pill dissolves in her face cream and that was the pill she was going to try to slip to Castro her. Her case agent was a guy named frank sturgeous who wound up being one of the Watergate burglars. See the thing about Bay of pigs and the Cubans, the Bay of Pigs invasion is the key to understanding the whole ladder part of the 20th century politics in the United States.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       The Cold War, because the alliance between the CIA and the Cubans rears its head constantly throughout the latter part of the 20th century. The Watergate burglary, five out of seven of the burglars were Cubans. Bay of Pigs Veterans Day had been recruited by a guy named Ed Howard Hunt. CIA agent who was one of the orchestrators of the Bay of pigs. Invasion was also one of the people that on his deathbed said that he was involved in the assassination of Kennedy. Yes. This. So the CIA would come to these Cuban exiles, the militant exiles, and they'd say, go do this operation, go do this burglary at the, at the Watergate, and then we go get fidel, go do this assassination. And then we go get fidel. And the Cubans were always ready and willing because it was all leading back to getting. It was all leading back to. Did you ever see the images of what they said was Ed Howard Hunt?

Speaker 1:          00:21:48       He was one of the people that was arrested. There was a series of, um, uh, there was a bunch of guys that were arrested that were on trains that were calling them hobos were all very well dressed, right, that were near where the grassy knoll men on the grass. Oh, there's lots of rumors about that, that Howard hunt was one of those men. There was even a reference that Jose Miguel battle was one of those men, but that couldn't have been the case because he was in the army at the time of the US army. Um, no, so, so it's like a, it's like a subterranean narrative that runs through the latter part of the 20th century, the CIA and right wing elements in American politics using the Cuban Americans to do all kinds of dirty covert deeds. And we're talking about terrorist activity. Assassination of an ambassador from Chile, right in Washington DC blew up his car because he was sympathetic to Castro.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       A bomb planted on a Cuban, a jetliner flying from Panama City to advantage 73 people killed. Innocent people occluding the fencing team from Cuba. Young people, a dirty war, a dirty war was waged by the anti-castro underground, uh, in combination in partnership with the CIA and this, we know about it now because a lot of it has been declassified and it's come out, we didn't know about it at the time it was taking place, why they blow up the plane, just an act of terrorism against Cuba to uh, to show them that it could be done to instill fear and paranoia in the queue. The, the concept was to destabilize the Cuban government so they'd be vulnerable and then you could take them over. So any, any act against Cuba. I mean asking why blow the plane would, is asking like why fly planes into the World Trade Center?

Speaker 1:          00:23:42       You know, it was just a destructive act. It's pretty amazing how resilient Castro was. I mean, unbelievable. The guy's 90 miles away from Miami and just ran shit through the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties into the 2000. They say there was something like 632 known plots to over over the course of four or five decades to kill category. Incredible. Six hundred and 32, that's 101 ways to kill Fidel. And he went to, he got a little train in New York and they're like, are you fucking crazy? And they checked the see the other bullet proof vest anomalies. Like, no, he took the train to you. Went wow. Like he's fucking nuts. He was fucking nuts. So, so, um, what makes this, this gangster story of the corporation so interesting and different is this political context, the framework that all this shit was taking place against the backdrop of this desire to kill Castro and take back, take back the homeland and anyone who was involved in that was seen as a hero within the community.

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       Joey can tell you about that. Union city, New Jersey and Miami where the hotbeds of the anti-castro movement. There were, where it was an organization in Union city called Omega seven and there was one in Miami called Alpha 66. These were terror organizations, secret organizations that existed to plant bombs. They would plant bombs at embassies in the united, you know, in New York City. They would put, they would put bombs at Lincoln Center when a, when a, when an orchestra from Cuba was making an appearance, they were trying to shut down any relationship between the US and Cuba and governments that were sympathetic to Cuba. They would, they would do actions against them. And this went on for like 40 years. Man. That's unbelievable. You mentioned for dome the Seventies in Union city, like a joke. It's not a joke. Don't even don't even bring them up dog, because you will get some mad now.

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       Was there any pro for Dell support amongst Cubans? There was and bad things would happen to them. Um, in the United States and Cuba though. What about in Cuba Pro Castro, India. Oh yeah, sure. I mean, was it real or was it out of? Fear is real. It's real. I mean, I've been there numerous times, you know, the killing people made a choice, uh, and the revolution I believe would have happened with or without Fidel Castro. I'm the guy who was in power bi. Tiesta had taken over the government and the coup d'etat, he wasn't elected, so he was kind of a fraudulent president and there was an ever since he got in, people knew it was a fraudulent president and there was attempts to try to ouster him and that's why he was such a dictator. He knew they wanted the house to him, so he used the military to repress any kind of movement against him and it was ugly and the people rose up against it. That's what happened. It wasn't so in my belief, the revolution in Cuba happened for a very legitimate reason. After it happened in power, it was revealed that Castro and Che Guevara were communists. He casta was very cagey about that. During the revolution, they never talked about Marxism and being communists or any of that, and in fact, fidel came to union city, came to the United States to raise money for the revolution while it was going on. Got arrested.

Speaker 1:          00:27:17       My friend's mom, the escalades, says, she says, she still remembers taking the bus in the morning in union city and Fidel's welcome to underwhelm talking to you. How you doing? Susan, what's going on? Wow. He got in a bar room room. He got in a bar room argument in a union city and he got arrested over what, a probably politics. I'm sure it was a political discussion. Um, so, so then the revolution happened and, and you know, Cuba becomes a repressive communist Stalinist dictatorship. But a lot of Cubans, the way they saw it as, that was the choice they made to go with Fidel. He did have a, I think the, the, uh, popularity of the people following of the people. Some people are quite proud of Castro standing up to the United States. Cubans are very proud people and they take a lot of pride in the fact that even though there's so much hardship there that um, it's a choice they made to go in this direction.

Speaker 1:          00:28:23       At least they have their, their self pride, uh, which is more in the, can be said in some ways about Puerto Rico and Jamaica and Dominican Republic, all these other countries in that region that are just as poor as Cuba. Um, so he has his supporters. He always had his support. Obviously. He also had his detractors even within Cuba. Um, most of those people are the ones who got on rafts and tried to leave the island at great risk to themselves to do anything to get out of there because they realize fidel was so popular from within the country. You are never gonna be able to take him down. So they made the decision to go out in the ocean and try to brave the risks of, of either swimming or sailing or across the Florida Straits,

Speaker 4:          00:29:15       what the fuck happened with Che Guevara. How did Che Guevara all of a sudden emerge as this leftist political icon, but in this really weird sort of clueless way. Like they really didn't understand his background, really didn't understand who he was and what he had done and the atrocities that he had committed. But these fucking tee shirts that all these dopey liberal kids, those fucking things. That's fucking crazy. If you find out who that guy is, your, you're wearing a mass murderers t shirt, like he was a fucking ruthless cut. And these people are wearing this shirt is if he symbols symbolizes like liberty or freedom from an oppressive government or something like that. It's. But it was a long period of time where you didn't have any Che Guevara. There was no discussion of it and that it seems like somewhere in the two thousands it picked up. Am I right?

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       Yeah. Eight. Let me tell you something. It was so personal for awhile. Like I have Argentinian friends, but in the seventies there was a rift between Argentenians in Cuba. That's how personal it is. Argentinians is Argentina and there was a rift like because of him, because of him like Cuban. Is the FEC data here really welcomed that extra the fuck? What is that? They talk how they talk to Phillip? Yeah. What humans would go off and union city of you were Argentinian really? That's how deep age and read Cuban Spanish. How did the list thing, where did that come from?

Speaker 2:          00:30:58       Why? I don't know. It's just a regional, regional thing and they. They're the number one on the top. Like if a, if a Cuban what? Look. Look at Cuba's, the is considered the that were the Jews of the Caribbean, but Spain as one old, like people, like my father's family was from Spain and I went there one time and never went back. Really get one time to meet my grandmother. Never went back. Why? Because she was talking shit. No one at five talk to me. That shit about my mother got me hooked up to my mother. She Spain is the colonial powers, the colonial often, often Spaniard to look down on the Cubans and Mexicans I'm sure as well. So I went over there one time. My mom took me to meet my grandmother in like 10 minutes and would call my mother, you fucking cunt.

Speaker 2:          00:31:52       My mother came over and goes, what happened and what this fucking bitch is talking about. She was about five. My mother cursed her out. My relationship. She was like, my father was, your father is going to be at that because she was from Cama way so that shit didn't stink. My mom was a peasant from Havana, so she was at. My son had big dreams until he met your, your that animal. Fuck you. You fucking like she made my mother moved in with him in Cuba. They learn how to cook the dishes. Cc'd Spaniard would be offended. Just by the way Cubans speak Spanish. Yes, but really like a lot of people tortured me when they did the. I don't speak Cuban Spanish. I speak. I speak the Spanish or the streets. That Spanish. I picked up in union city that streets by. Let me stop me now when I'm on.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       Huh? Anybody that gave you a hard time about translating. This is what I always tell people. I'll talk in English. Repeat what I said. Good luck in English. Yeah, it's fucking hard. It's hard to remember what someone said. Especially Yoga was speaking to these long sentences and you were translate. You did a great job, but my Spanish is. Instead of giving me $5, I want to mold a mold. That means or none. We don't say nothing because in my world attend spot is a. I forget what it is. There's a name for it. Yeah, for everything. I learned how to speak Spanish and code a peeler. That means keep your eyes open and put your batteries in your. When I say to you, that means you got to put your batteries in. So I learned that street. Is this a Bergen County street thing? No, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:33:34       This is Hudson county. It's a Cuban. I word my. Yeah, but it INA, we talking Cubans in the US or like when I talk, when I talked to my sister on the phone, I have no idea what you said. Really. Like when she gives me an address and shit. Anyway, the ours and all that. I took Italian in high school. I didn't take basic Spanish. I learned how to read Spanish in the house by reading different things, but I learned how to speak Spanish. Like I remember going as a Cuban person's house once and you didn't city when I was about 12 and they told their son, don't bring this kid over here. He's a street fucking SPEC.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       St's back. I learned. I'll say they get on a long time though. I didn't learn that traditional Spanish. My Spanish is a lot of hands. Segment was oil. I see. I see the people, that means watch him, watch him and don't fucking not watch them a lot. It's a lot of street shit. I was never allowed to walk home the same way. You had to walk on different directions, different directions to keep the car. Don't, don't put it in my mother's operation. I could never just walk home on Burger line to walk to New York Avenue. We'll walk down just to see if I saw a suspicious car. Now. That's smart. Were you remembering? You remember? We were in San Francisco about 15 years ago and we had the Cru, tate, Eddie, uh, you may Red Duncan and Redman will walking down the street in San Francisco. As we approached and I saw a drug deal go down.

Speaker 2:          00:35:11       I hit already going. I already look at that drug. Do you guys were looking at the whole thing? Not One of you saw it already goes. How the fuck did you see that? Because I was raised like that. I was raised to go out and look for cars. I was never allowed to walk home the same way twice. Yeah. Because of the lead the business. Now, let me ask you about that because w, is this an instinct you learned on your own or were you actually. I was. When I became a numbers runner, as a child, I was always. My mom would put a. When I was a kid and I came from Cuba, my mother put up a big gold chain on me. You know why? Because she did you to take it off my sheet. My mother wanted you to take that chance so I wouldn't have to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:35:56       Really? Yeah, so I remember one time Mr. softy. He came and he looked at my goal thing and my mother yelled from the window, don't let them touch your fucking chain. Yesterday I went to Glendale and my daughter was throwing hoops hoop and she was chasing them all four of them by herself. She's an only child, so it was other kids there and the red hoop fell through the thing and some 60 year old took it from that. My daughter went to put her head down. I go, Oh yeah, go take it back. Go take it back. And she just looked at me and the parent was like, that's an effective way of parenting. She got back from your daughter. Don't ever stay hitting my fucking house. Wait a minute though. The mom of the kid that took it was giving you shit. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:36:41       Because this is today's America, my America. We don't come home at what did. What did the mom wants you to do? Mom and the dad to Glendale fucking gentiles. The Dad said, that's an effective way of of whatever box saying nothing bitch. Your daughter. A couple of weeks ago, a little girl took the swing from my daughter. Take the swing back. My wife's like, what are you doing? That's how Cubans raised their kids. I was raised to always have my eyes open because I knew what they did. I was at a young age if I hung out with Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan's dad, so coke. I knew Joe Rogan's Dad. So Coke Jolen. What? I would never tell you. I came from a house where it was. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       right. But you know, here's the thing. If a. If they wanted to get at your mother, they had come after the kid. Yeah, they come in. It was very common. Again, kidnapped the kid. That's how you. That's how you got to somebody. Well, that's how you get to everybody

Speaker 4:          00:37:40       mean this is a. This trump thing was stormy daniels. Do you see? One of the things that she said that one of the reasons why she came a lot about this. Somebody came up to her in a parking lot when she was holding her infant daughter. I don't know if this is true. This is what she says. Someone came up to her and said, you have a beautiful daughter. It'd be a shame if anything happened to her mother. Now stop talking about president trump wasn't president trump at the time. Stop talking about Mr Trump, and she was like, oh, fuck you. Or fuck this, and then you know. Then she really, really geared up or animosity towards them. Imagine that Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:38:13       Hey, in the narco world, there's cases of what they would do is they will do a video tape. There was somebody they wanted to intimidate. They'd videotape their kid being taken to school every morning, being dropped off for school, picked up after school. They videotape the daily routine of the child and then they'd send the video tape to that person and I, I need to

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       know where your kid is every, every minute of the day. Do what we tell you to do. He doesn't fuck with me though. I was never fucked with. I was never really a and a no, no. I was never fucked with. I was just raised to understand what they were doing it. There's consequences and I was allowed to repeat it. So when I would come to you and you will be talking about whatever. Even if I knew you were wrong, I would never correct you. So that's how I was raised. I would never correct you. He would if I knew you were talking shit because how do you know? How do I know? I was just at the fucking bar and they were talking about I tried to fuck. I know my mom didn't hide nothing from me growing up. That's good and bad that it had good things for me, but a lot of bad things to me, you know, one of the things that he touched upon this book was not only about Jose battle, but the political corruption that came with it in 20 years.

Speaker 2:          00:39:33       Have I ever talked to you about bottling things to ever. I wouldn't listen to politics if you paid me because it's all bullshit. I saw it and I and a micro level, you know when you, when you a president who do you get donations from? Big Farm guns, whatever. When you're a small mayor who they get donations from the pharmacy, the pizza place, the numbers. So I came from a society where those numbers are controlling everything and in North Bergen, union city and West New York, and we remember that Shit's a felony in Jersey misdemeanor in New York. Really? Numbers. It used to be misdemeanor. As a matter of fact, they would call you never go Joe Lieutenant. We wouldn't say that because the phones would take. He would just call you and go, you're getting a visit today. That means if you've got $5,000 in your pocket and give it to Jamie, cleaned out the house, leave some paperwork at 2:00, I come, I handcuff you, I take your money, I write your summons and bring it down to the station.

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       We get go. And then after I let you, how did I meet you around the corner? You had $2,500. I'll give you 1250 [inaudible] and that's a cost of doing business. You know, there's a funny line in Goodfellas when he goes, how can I go to school with all that goody, goody bullshit and salute the flag. When I left, I was the same one. Like I saw what happened. I saw the political system. I saw two cops coming in, one detective once a week and one big guy. My mom would give him a drink and an envelope. Yeah. I don't know what my grandmother did, what she was involved, but I told her she went to jail, the jail for running the numbers. She went to jail because she wouldn't give anybody up. They wanted her to give up. Whoever the fuck was at the other end of the organization, and so for like six months we were always trying to like, where the fuck is grandma still all she's visiting her sister who was always. She's visiting Aunt Josie and just knowing for bookmaking

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       and Jersey six, five months, right. Then they put you on house arrest and you had done. She would knit sweaters and shit for the fucking guards in jail. Well, a lot of times battle would own the judges. So you wouldn't do any time, you might get it, you might get a summons, you go before a magistrate judge and they let you go. What's fascinating to me is about, this is all so fascinating about the job itself was that a lot of it is basically dissolved that all this came from immigration and that this, uh, this melting pot of the United States and they all came from all these other places and all this organized crime sort of like was running the, the cities in the east coast. But most of it is kind of gone the wayside. I would dispute that a little bit. I think traditional organized crime, as we knew it in the 20th centuries, gone by the wayside, Italian, Irish, Jewish, that sort of assimilated into the system and has dissipated, but there's new generations, immigrants that are playing this out, Jamaicans to make Americans, Chinese, Russians, Mexicans.

Speaker 1:          00:42:43       It's happening. And I further make the argument that the corruption that was created during prohibition in the 19 twenties, that's where the system was created during prohibition in the 19 twenties, the, uh, alliance between the underworld and the upper world, the connection between the political apparatus, law enforcement and the criminal rackets. That template was laid down during prohibition and it was an effect for the next 100 years. I think that templates still exists. You pick up a newspaper in any US city, large or mid sized city. And what are you going to see on the first couple of pages, some local representative who just got indicted for taking money from some criminal element to see that they got a law passed or that they got some municipal contract. Uh, that hasn't gone away. That still exists everywhere. What happens is there's an ebb and flow. Certain rackets come and go, it was illegal booze and it was labor racketeering.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Now it's narcotics. It was Belita at one time. There's always something, you know, as long as there's commerce being done on a large scale, there's always room for corruption as long as there's things that are illegal with this market for like marijuana argument. Yeah, right. The big argument about marijuana laws, the United States is if they made it legal, it would severely limit the power to the cartel in Mexico has cut all that violence out. Basically the same shit that was going on with Al Capone and, and everything during the liquor there. Time with liquids. Yeah. Because the criminal rackets feed the system. Human beings are flawed human beings at every level of the system. Dirty cops, cops on the take. I mean, is it more difficult now for them to pull something like this off? It's less systemic, you know what I mean? I mean, back in the day, you know, uh, you'd have corruption that was all the way through the chain of command, you know, and everyone was sort of in on it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       Now you see the seven five. Yes, I did. I also saw your interview with Michael Dell. Fascinating. Yeah, that was fascinating. Um, yeah, I mean he, he, he, and that was 20 years after the nap nap commission which revealed that level of corruption. Um, yeah, no, see there's, you have social systems and you will have corruption. You have a money making system like capitalism, you will have corruption that doesn't go away. Organized crime has the face of organized crime has changed quite a bit, but the core of, of that corrupt relationship between the underworld and the upper world still exists.

Speaker 2:          00:45:21       So is it the most disenfranchised sort of members of the community, the most recent immigrants? Like what, what is it that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       Yeah, I've written about this a lot, you know, two different books and through journalism I've come to believe that it's the American story. This process of going through organized crime and gangsterism before you become accepted as a full blown American. Um, every, almost every ethnic group has gone through some version of it in the US and it's still an is still going through it. It's part of the American process. You get here as a group, your your cutout of access, a immediate access anyway to to power and so you create your own path and initially in these organizations it's usually those ethnic groups praying on their own, preying on each other. That's usually the first stage of this and then it becomes a creating a system to try to deal with larger system of corruption. I mean Jose Miguel battle. What he did was so brilliant by creating the corporation is he created a path for himself within American organized crime which was controlled primarily by the mafia and he created an alliance with the mafia that made it possible for the Cubans to have their thing and and fly below the radar. I mean while he Italians were getting busted left and right. The Cubans, the Cubans. This corporation existed for 40 years because they didn't really get messed with with

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       much. Why is that like what was it the. The way the Italians there were so flashy, like particularly when you got the God he was the most ridiculous, were pretty damn flashy too. Some of them. Some of this, some of them I, I till this day I detest nice cars. I had the test show calling attention to yourself because I saw too tight, like right now, like I would love to talk to the producers of this film because they're going to miss a lot of authentic stuff. I'm sure that we'll have. In fact, I have a present for you. I ordered you the same shirt, Bruce Lee, war and fist of fury. They called. Cami said, that's Chine US Cubans. When you, when you were a success memo and Tony goes into see his mother Mama success. I, I read that like gastro. When you become a success in union city, the Chinese tee is your first sign of success because it has three buttons here, right?

Speaker 2:          00:47:54       So you cut the buttons off and young. What's your middle name? James. So it's Joseph James Rogan in diamond initials. You putj j dot and that's when you've reached success and they need that. They, they, they, that's part of their, you know, like there's so many little things that Cubans did, but taken down like one for example, my stepfather. Brilliant, brilliant. You know Paulie didn't talk on the phone. Well move for anybody. Paul, he had his message is delivered. Then in 1970, I'm looking at both of you gentlemen and I'm telling you that one would not even have a conversation if there was a phone in the room and it was hung up because in his mind that phone was fucking tapped, right? He was a genius. If he had a meet Joe Rogan for a meeting at nine at 5:30 in the morning, he'd come and put a gun under a car just in case there was a problem with Joe Rogan.

Speaker 2:          00:48:55       He will hug you and you searched him. He would hug you and tap your back for a wire and tell you you will lose some weight and rub your belly at all. Then they hug you, but that feeling you for a pink one. When my mother died, he still had the same car that he had when he died with $5 million cash and he lived in a four story walk up. When he died, one of his friends said, what a miserable life to make money and have to hide it like that one would walk around with jeans and t shirts the same shit every day. And a wad of hundreds like this. The hidden one. The other one was single. So you thought he was broke. If he talked to you, he talked to you in English. Once the cops came. Me. No biggie. You know, who was the interpreter for all the attorney meetings where all those high level guys.

Speaker 2:          00:49:47       Me Really? So I'd be at school, I'd be at home when my mom would go tomorrow you have to go with child to the Lucas Office. Sam, they'll Luca and Sam. The local will look at you and go, I don't Joe, great to see you today. You'd have to bring him a suit. He loves suit Sam de Luca. So the more suits you brought them, the better. He was like the other guy, the guy that had the thing, but Sam would treat you just like this Joe Rogan. We ain't okay. You're going to interpret. This was how fast the conversation was. You got busted for conspiracy of bookmaking. That's two years listening to this judge. She's a motherfucker, but thank God I know the

Speaker 5:          00:50:27       prosecutor. So Day one I'm going to do for $300,000. We lose the episodes for 200,000 a year for 100,000. You get probation and you do a year and a half way house for 50,000. He just gives you a menu when you decide what you want to do, get back to me. Always a pleasure to see you and you had a week to decide what you were going to do. Wow. So you gave him that amount. He knew his way through the court system. You didn't do no time. There's no time. I know for a fact that if you get caught with a gun to New York, you get. What's the law? He. Yeah, there was some mandatory mandatory. There's no goal. There's no trial and take you right to my stepfather. Wong got caught with a gun. He was under the next day. The Lucas don't play game Deluca.

Speaker 5:          00:51:21       Don't play games now. Now and answer Joe and answer to your question about the Cubans and why they existed for so long and didn't get busted, you know, the rumor was that they had a certain mystique because of this CIA, a pedigree and that they were untouchable and in factor. I mentioned it in the book, there's a case where the FBI is thinking about making a case against battle. This is way back in the sixties. They contact the US Treasury Department because they figure he's not paying taxes and they can make some kind of case against him and a tax violation. They got a letter from the Treasury Department saying, we're not going to go after this guy because he's anti-castro and he's a veteran of the Bay of pigs invasion. It's right there in a, in a, in a letter from the Treasury Department to the FBI. Wow. So there were elements within the government that we're protecting these guys, particularly bay of Pigs veterans.

Speaker 5:          00:52:17       We will not prosecute them. That's incredible. And so he had that kind of protection with a name too, Huh? Jose battle bottling. Yeah. His name is Spanish. Was bothy a bat l, l e, and he changed it to balance a good one, right? If you're, if you're a writer and a novelist and you're trying to think of a good name for the character that she can't do any better than. I grew up with a kid named major battle God to taekwondo. His name was major battle. That motherfucker too bad. Motherfucker named major battle was his middle name. Bad mother fucker. Major bad mother. But it was. It was a black belt state champion and the only reason why they existed, they were very careful. They have a systemized union city, Ran Union city becomes Jersey City and hoboken you didn't see ran seventh street to 88th street to white castle, but the Cubans really controlled seven to 48th street Bergen line.

Speaker 5:          00:53:15       And then when you went to New York Avenue, they control from $50 up to about 60th street and they kept to themselves and they didn't have social clubs and it didn't play cards outside. And if you want them to the bar, they wore dress very, moderately before. From what? Bookies. And they only stayed there till 3:00 because that's when the number goes in, so you have from nine in the morning to three to play that number. But there's also a thing called a singular number, which the odds are a little less. That started about 12. So I'll see you at 12 and go for it. Normal it. Make a mother fucker. I'll never listened to that fucking kid of mine again. Now I got to go back to the booking and bet the second number, call that. That's one number at a time. So I have an optimization putting down $100,000 on, on what the number five is.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       What is the number of year, the potential numbers talking single digits on. I can play three digit. Read that. You Bet. Three digit. So why would it be a single number? Well, that was just a different one. A different one. Different systems, different systems. Certain ways you can do it. But let's explain this where the number comes from. Okay. The total mutual handle at the race track is published in the newspaper every evening and again and again in the morning. How much money was bet total at the race track that day? The last three numbers. That's the daily number. So everyone you know has the same number for everybody. You know what it is as soon as it comes out in the newspaper and that's how it's determined. So you have, you have the individual numbers and then you have the early number with which is called welcome come out of Brooklyn, guest Saleo in Brooklyn and then you will have the late number.

Speaker 5:          00:55:06       What's The New York number? That's number in the New York number side. Like what it would be based on that was decided probably a hundred years ago by some by some, you know a Guinea who ran, who ran it for the Italians and maybe it came from Sicily. Whatever. The origins of it. You couldn't have fixed that though. It's like it's gambling so it can't fix it. Why isn't it? Because it's the. I don't know what the track is going to make that. Fix that. How would you say you fixed the last three numbers? Checked this out. Certain organizations like the corporation, part of the reason people wanted to bet with them and like to bet with them is they would have somebody at the race track, so the minute that number was posted, they'd know the number. So you'd get your, you didn't have to wait around for a newspaper or for sports, you had to call sports. Uh, nobody remembers that. You remember that Tj, how are you doing? Welcome. This is Joe Rogan. You just called sports live. You've got to sit by a payphone and put thirty five cents and they would run all right that, that child and after the scores and they give you the score, but whatever. You Bet. What's the last fucking thing? Oh, so you had to sit there and take that whole. We have beat mother fucker. Give it to me. And then when it came to them saying the number, the subway go by and

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       you're just lost another thirty five cents. But the whole number system, like my mother was a degenerate numbers and then she will kill the, with the Yankees and the red sox later on. But her game was the numbers, the three numbers didn't do your track and now let's get greedy. Why don't we go to Otb? Yeah. Now see this is where. Why don't we just go to old beat a really complete your fucking day? You degenerate the brilliance of battle. And his organization was, he didn't do sports betting and in fact his arrangement with the Italians, with the mafia was you get Belita, you get numbers, but you don't get sports betting and you don't get these other things. And so there was a. there's an. There's an example in this book of a, of a member of the corporation who starts against battles. Wishes starts playing, doing sports, betting at that guy wound up dead.

Speaker 1:          00:57:18       A battle killed himself because he was going against the agreement going against the rule, going against the rules that could turn them off against them and bring the whole thing down. Right, right. Wow, that's amazing. Now and answer your question about how, how they came up with that number. You got to remember, it's all gambling. This is the culture of gambling. You know, you're at the race, track, your bedding card games, you're bedding petting the number, so it's logical that somewhere in that universe would be how the number was determined. So it came from the race track and then you also have the Puerto Rican lottery and that comes and paperwork. It's different. That's completely different. Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork that comes a lottery tickets. My mother would buy the whole fucking sheet. It's like $10 a thing, but you could just buy the sheet. And what is it?

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       It's a Puerto Rican. Them now you know that the corporation use the Puerto Rican lottery to launder their profits. Yeah. So you hit the number. You're my friend. What are you gonna win 20,000 by the time they give it to you. Let me just give you 18. Do you know that's how Whitey bulger laundered money, right? That's how Sammy the bull one lottery tickets to Whitey bulger won the lottery twice. Twice. People. The neighborhood won the lottery and he bought the ticket from them, gave him money or whatever the fuck he gave him. Check this one out. Today's paper. A front page of USA Today, confessions of a lottery scammer. I brought this along. I taught if he interest lottery scam. This is a guy, big fat guy, trainer pounds sitting on his ass in Iowa or somewhere who was on his device who figured out some way to intrude on some algorithm and he started scamming different states. He scammed the state of Colorado out of four point $8 million dollars. And uh, there is uh, a total of 16 point five. Boy, you guys are good. A 16 point $5 million. I'm now I'm thinking if this guy had scammed the corporation led by Jose Miguel battle,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       he, he, he'd be, he'd be dead. He wouldn't be on the be beyond the obituary section. Look what it says here was never my intent to start a full out ticket scam. Yeah, yeah. His sentence up to 25 years old years old. Not Scam, organized crime in this way. How do you skim lottery? Like you figure out, you figure out how the number is determined and then you're able to play with it. You're able to play with it. See, in organized crime, you couldn't do understand that. How could he like, isn't there just a random system, a computer program or something? Yeah. He found some way to, to, uh, to tap into that computer system to tap onto me to hack into a hack into it and can alter the number. Oh, wow. That's crazy. Wow. That is crazy. What is fascinating to me is this, what you were talking about earlier when we're talking about, about like that this was, it gave them an opportunity for hope and that it was a part of the community.

Speaker 5:          01:00:20       We're missing that in the west coast, the west coast, like offtrack, betting. There's no fucking here. There's a few Weirdos that go to the Hollywood park, but that's gone now. You know what I mean? There's nothing in the west coast. Never had this, does nothing. Yeah. There's nothing like seeing that. Like, I saw that and I saw what goes with it and it may sound he spoke it in most people, but it's not who you spoke to. The people who are really, really Sicilian people who are normal Cuban. When you're a Sicilian in that culture, there's women that you go to them, they tell you things that witches, the Sicilian witches, whatever the fuck you want to and sleepers remember, he goes, bring the eyeballs. So this lady, what sleeper sleepers is a movie about for Irish kids that lay there was bullshit because of a woman.

Speaker 5:          01:01:09       You remember that movie? It's about the four kids narrow place. A priest, priest, but a Brad Pitt grandson. Okay. There it is. Barry Levinson movies. Then they got the guy on the leather men. Then he started backtracking like Steven Seagal by the CIA involvement. Lorenzo Carter. He later on became. It was a true story and it was not a story. It was based. But uh, if you look at it one, two for those two kids were supposed to grow up to be west. Yeah. But it wasn't bullshit. It's bullshit. Like they, the two other, the four of those guys. What are we talking about? Talking about? Well, you were talking dollar witches. He, you know, in the Cuban world, it's the same thing. I want my kid to go to Catholic school, right? If I play this fucking number today, this is gonna. Save me. We, you know, we don't. When you're a comic you have that hope tonight I'm going to go to the Improv. Just Sasha was going to be that. Maybe you know, just made it. It's a, but it's an ethnic hope that comes back from your country. It's hard to describe.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       You understand that because your grandmother was a fucking booky. But if you talked to her on a daily basis about it and why she would play that particular number. Like my mom played five slash 17. Those are the last three numbers on my dad's gravestone, you know, 604 with some other fucking hallucinogenic. She had. If I go like this, if I go like this and I go, you know what, you're looking good today and they'll take a yard stick. Most Cuban is look at it and go give me $5 on to fifth grade because it's the last three numbers of 20. You fucking gave me. Now is this still going on? Oh yeah. The numbers are still going on. Not In a, not as a, not as a 10 minute head office. When I was a kid it was a 10 man office. You went downstairs, you had a bodega, me and you ran the Bodega is use and yesterday's paper always selling the book of dreams and then you come in and you give me six.

Speaker 2:          01:03:17       Oh, four slash five slash 17. It's comes on three sheets of paper with with copy paper. So right away I ripped the top one. I give it to you. I keep the other one and the other one goes upstairs to the department where now there's a big wall with zero to nine on the wall and I parked that. So Joe just came up and played 2:19. There's two and all of a sudden there's a list that goes down. I'm a board guy. I just worked the board. I got six guys with phones yelling numbers on me. Oh Hey. At rogen fucking just put $100 and that number, that motherfucker killed me last week sometime send $50 of that to Miami because I got unloaded to create the Utopia. You know when you. When I take a sports, but I'm taking $500 on Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh's plain New England.

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       I can't take 10,000 on Pittsburgh and $5,000 New England. That's not called a utopia. I'm going to make money on the vig. The 10 points from you losing. So if you bet 10,000 on somebody and you bet five. I unload five a to another bank somewhere across town. So this is how an. I mean when I was a kid, my mother had a bank in the Bronx and the guy that cooked was black Mike. He was a Vietnam vet and I was five and he would give me 10 bucks to go get them. Blackberry, brandy black. Mike cooked Italian food. That was so fucking good. It was 1970. Even if you hate a black we, you waited his spaghetti. Even Italians came to eat his spaghetti on Wednesdays. He could corn beef on Wednesdays. He made Cuban food. They have an office and every phone has a little tape recorder with a wire connected to the phone. So you can't call me and say you played two eight. Yeah, it's recorded. Fucking busted your way to tape for you. So every hour the tapes come around the same and those get destroyed the week after or that night after everything settled, but the CEO's offices in action when you're a kid and I'm going to get cigarettes

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       and they'd give me a 10 to go get a three donald pack of cigarettes. I keep seven now. Did you ever see the money? What do you mean? The moral of the money that was gathered? I saw how the money would be taken to a separate location. I will be a separate location room now. There's also they move locations every week. You also have to stay ahead of the cops. So every week you got a guy like Joe Rogan that just rents apartments woman. So every week we moved locations so nobody ever gets comfortable with three months at one place than what? Three months in another place. Then what? Three months in the other place, because not only will you have to worry about cops, you got to worry about Jamie getting a little fucking cocky. Jamie found out from Joe does that they make $40,000 a day, Jamie's two guns, two guns and try to go up there and see what happens because they got two guys on the third floor that just got two guns waiting for idiots like you to come upstairs to the fourth floor.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       It was surreal. It was surreal. So in the morning is my mom would go, you want to go to school or you want to color match and go, yeah, I go, I'm going with you because he's bookies will all give me 20, 40 bucks. It's part of that good. Now check this out. At the end of the day, every day that this is going on there, because betting is going at every day, seven days a week and the system that joy's talking about, so money's coming in, a lot of money's coming in. It goes to the accounting rooms, so at the end of the day you got a lot of money and like two, 300 different locations all around the New York area. What they would do is they have people whose responsibility it was to come around and collect the money. That money would go into a van and that van would have a police escort as it left New York City went through the tunnel and in New Jersey it was met by New Jersey police who picked it up and escorted from there into the apartments or the houses in union city where the money was crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:07:10       Wow. So the cops got paid. So how can I tell you this? At the age of 10, I knew this, but I could never tell. You wouldn't believe me, so I had to keep it to myself. Well, most of the kids wouldn't be able to shut the fuck up. I was talking about not the corner I see in my world. I didn't win. What were your Saturday? We played handball all day. I had to go to a play with my uncle, the youngest. You worked for a sports betting place to later on as I got older, but when I got out of high school, I was such a loser. Then I went to 118th street. The guy's name was Chad, Jose Torres and the son. I went through them like a man. They were around the block to this guy named Raleigh and Miguel and they ran a complete different operation from the cooperation. Raleigh still around. If I had any balls left, I go put a bullet and Riley's had because Raleigh was tight with my mother. My mother helped get Raleigh started on 118th street. When my mother died, he got tight with my stepfather. When my stepfather died, he took that money and gave it to my stepfather. Sister. That money belonged to me. So today I'm still pissed off

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       at Raleigh because when I was a kid, I just want to Raleigh every fucking day. He gave me 50 bucks. Every time I went over there, those guys lived their life. I'm a Karma based life, so whenever they see Joe Rogan come in, feel man, you know how many things I did with your father to come in as $100. Go Get your Dick sucked. My mother would drive me crazy. Like how much money did you get to? 200. Could give me $100 of that because I used to buy knives and fucking stars to throw at people, but that's there with. They're very generous Joe Rowe, you know, you can't do that when you come over to my house with your daughters. I can't. First thing is they do is put a 50 and everybody's here. So now the girls know whenever they would come over uncle Joey's, they get a 50.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       So even after you're not around, they'll come over when they're 14 and they going to go to Hollywood. They'll come over by uncle joe, Uncle Joey. When you girls, you girls got money is 50. So I had people giving me money because it's a car. I'm a base business. The more I, my mother would hit the number for $10,000 to give away. Really? Yeah. Because that's the generosity part of it. It's part of the community. It's part of the. That's the thing. You were talking about the communal communal and I think that was even more pronounced with the Cubans because of the history of Bollito and the cultural significance of belief going back to Cuba. That's something they brought with them to the United States and that was just, you know, like I said, it wasn't seen as a, as a criminal thing. It wasn't seen as a violent criminal thing.

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       Now what happens with Jose Miguel battle is at a certain point in 1985, he moves from union city to Miami and he moves the hierarchy of the organization to Miami, but the money is still being made in New York City. The organization is as strong as ever in the money's being made in the five boroughs of New York and it's being shipped down to Miami where this guy now lives like a, a gentleman farmer on an estate. He surrounds himself with mamay trees, a mamay. Is it fruit from Cuba that he associates that? The Shaker here? He goes, sure. Oh yeah. They did wonderful fruit. Beautiful. The great military. So he associated with his childhood. So the first thing he does is he surrounds his estate down in Miami with this fruit from his childhood and he lives down there now far removed from New York. Meanwhile, back in New York, a war breaks out between the Italians and the Cubans over this thing called the two block rule.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       When the Cubans and the Italians form their alliance, they established a rule that you couldn't, nobody could open up a believer to spot closer than two blocks to a preexisting bullied to spot somebody violated that rule. I don't even know, after investigating and who, who violated that rule. But that rule got violated and it turned into a nasty, a war. And arson war, they started firebombing each other spots and a lot of innocent people got killed. Man incinerated, a four year old girl got killed. Uh, it became horrific. Lasted for about eight or nine months. There was something like 70 murders may be 25 fire bombings at different spots. It got so ugly, it brought down the heat of the feds. Nobody could ignore this corporation thing anymore. So it brought a lot of unwanted attention to. They know who initially started it off. Who violated.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       Yeah, yeah. He became a snitch and told the whole story. The guy who violated it. Oh nothing. I violated it. But the guy who became the number one arsonist set up the whole campaign of arson. He became a snitch and told the whole thing, chapter and verse. So it's basically just one cocky person just decided, fuck this to blow. He was probably authorized by his bosses to do it. Yeah. Go over and burn that spot. We'll show them. And then that happened and then the response was, well, we'll show them. Go burn his spot. But burning the spot came out of someone violating the original deal. Yeah, two blocks away. That was the reason. The first burning half. Do they know who the guy was? That started the first day to sit down. They had a sit down about it. Here's how failed. It was.

Speaker 1:          01:12:24       The Italians and the Cubans had a major sit down about it to discuss it, to try to resolve it, to keep it from exploding into war. At that sit down, they didn't resolve anything and after they came out of the restaurant where the sit down took place, a drive by shooting occurred and one of the Cubans got shot at the restaurant coming out of the sit down and then the war was on. Man. It was on like battle said, we're at war with the Italians. That's what he said with his people and battle was ready for it. Man. He was good to go. I mean he, he was ready for that war. He seemed to want it. He seemed to cherish the idea that they were going to go to war with the Italians and so they were ordering all these horrific and you know how they did the arsons they'd get these Mama Luke's to fill up a, a pail with gasoline.

Speaker 1:          01:13:12       Not, not even a can, not even a closed Canon Open Pale and you know, they could spill and they took that pail of gas and they'd walk into a Bodega, bullied the spot and they dump it on the floor and light it on fire. And whoever happened to be in there too bad for them. And people would die a horrible death that got incinerated. I have some pictures in the book that are almost too horrific. I had others that were so bad. I didn't want to use them in the book. Really? You put something in that book that really blew my mind. You said that in 1975 or 76 in the Hudson county where I'm from, there was 40 car bombings. Oh Man. Forty car. Well, I remember one bombings, not all car bombing in Hudson county from seventh street. The 88th street there. Will you have bail?

Speaker 1:          01:13:58       Oh, bulking up. There was 41 car bombings. There was a time in the seventies in the US were bombings. Homemade bombs were like the preferred a weapon of organized. There were. There was a. There was a bombing war in Cleveland over this Irish gangster in the seventies. It was. It was pretty common to. They made a bomb with the males. The guy who had gotten the Sicilians were good. They did make a movie about Danny Green. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. What was that movie called? Kill the kill the Irishmen. And now that we're doing it again while they're doing the Irishman different movie. Yeah. It's fascinating stuff, man. Now, did anything surprise you when you were, you were putting me in. Obviously you're well versed in organized crime and well versed and these kinds of things. I think, uh, the dominant feeling people will have when they're reading this book is the dominant feeling I had when I was researching, which was why don't I know this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:14:55       I mean, this is really, this is not only a great story really interesting, but it's really important history, all this political connection to anti-castro movement and the role that the US government might have played in it. And the idea that this criminal conspiracy organization was allowed to go on for 40 years because certain elements in theU , s government didn't want to go after them because they were afraid it would open the lid on the Cuban relations with the, the anti-castro relations with the CIA, the politics of it. That's, that's, that's not only interesting history. It's important history to understand a certain social political relationship between the US and Cuba, the Bay of Pigs, the residue of the revolution that way, the way that shaped the cold war shaped us politics over a period of about 50 years. So I was like, why don't I know this? This is amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:15:51       This is like almost like a hidden history. I mean I knew what got reported in the newspapers, but you know, you lift up the rug and you, you look underneath the rug and you start to get into the details of it. It just makes me so aware that what we're receiving as information on a daily basis from the meat, mainstream media and everything is a version of what's happening. There's a whole other version of what's happening that we don't see and you usually only find out about it 30 years later, 30 years after the fact, and that's a good thing to know. Yeah. I mean, it sounds to me like this is A. I mean, I've, I haven't heard a peep about this. When you brought this up to me, joey and I was like, what? The Cuban organized crime, the corporation. What? What is this like?

Speaker 1:          01:16:37       This is not discussed. It's just not. Well, hopefully this will change. I grew up in it and I never talked about it because like I said, I have a hundred stores we go for around a buzzfeed. Right, right, right, right. There's a lot of shit. I was saying that I don't say it because number one, you're not going to believe me, and number two, it's not my position. I was raised as nothing me to say. Do you remember that? Yes, but I saw that as a child and then what made it worse for me, it was moving to North Bergen. Once I moved north Bergen,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       I saw what they were doing in union city in a bigger way, which is all political. I saw things that are make it tone drop. That's why I don't give a fuck about politics and the one when I see people talking about politics, I want to go up to them and go, if you knew what you were talking about, you wouldn't say a word because you have no idea what real politics means. How it works if it works like that and a micro system I can't imagine. And a real. So I don't want to pay attention to join. Let me ask you a question because I, I joined and I connected when I had more or less written this already. Um, if I had come to you way back at the beginning of this, out of the blue, all of a sudden this Guy Tj English, I don't know you because you knew the westies.

Speaker 2:          01:18:00       So you knew who I was. He knew I was legit. If I had contacted you and said, will you talk to me about this history? Would you have done it with everything? It would take us a week to debrief me. So you would have been ready in will. I would have told you. Now you see what's interesting, that thing I would have known because somebody has. Yeah. Here, this fucking story. He opened up the door for me. I have a responsibility now that I have another story that, to this. Yes he does. I have the nuts and bolts of how this works. Have you thought about in addition to this? I think there's going to be a number of spin off books from this. This is really a book that comes from. This is going to tell their personal story shot. I will end up dead.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Really. I will end up dead. Not because of the. Because of what I'm exposed to. We know who did it in. In a, in a. You know, I grew up when I was growing up, the power in that Hudson county was the waterfront Digi. That picture in New York City that people see. Thousands of people died for that waterfront. That waterfront was controlled by wheelock and. But everybody wanted a piece of it and North Bergen, one of the pieces of it. So my eighth grade teacher was the weehawken man. You ever have a teacher? That was a man. Why would a teacher be a mayor of a town? What? Why, why? Who's ever had a teacher tweet that was the mayor of a town at the same time I did. And guess what? At the end of my eighth grade, did atf come in and pull them out of that real?

Speaker 2:          01:19:37       He did 11 years. Okay. I was doing, he was selling the waterfront. He all that, that they knew that there's a particular family that I will not mentioned because I won't even make it to the four. Oh, five. And they were buying that property up change 60? No, no, no, it will buying that property up in the sixties. They were posing as politicians. They chop up $30 million a month now between four and then it. No, no, no. This is from all of the property they own in Hudson county. They bought everything. Jersey City hoboken. And they make their profit selling it? No, no. They made their profit renting it or renting it. So the four of them before brothers, Chubb $30 million. They go their own ways every month. They chopper 30 million. So I started from North Bergen. When I tell you stories about columbine bows, Zana, he was a cop.

Speaker 2:          01:20:31       He was a cop to that I got invited into. He opened up his home to me. Then his son died, the one that was my age, so I became a pseudo sun. So here I am running with the Cubans during the week. They're talking about numbers and drugs and everything, and I'm growing up in a cop's house. That's also the driver for the mayor and he would do whatever, like I still owe him handcuffed dudes and throw Beaton's on them and they call them the tour. They call them combine the torch Mazano, because his job was to burn your building down. The last one he burned down. Kids were like, Mr. Mr that smoke, and he's like, here's $10. Who can ice cream? I'll call the fire department. He never called him. He faked a heart attack. So you don't have to talk to reporters. First thing you do is you fake a heart attack because you don't have to talk to reporters. That gives you two days to get your story straight with the attorney that you have no idea what I know now.

Speaker 1:          01:21:28       Now the reason I asked, showing the question about whether he would have been willing to talk is a lot of people reached out to me early in this book process. The, uh, the, the, the movie rights were options before I even wrote the book based on the book proposal. And I got a lot of media attention and I started getting emails from nieces and nephews have sons and daughters of key characters in the story, and these were people like joey who had kept us personal family history, bottle cap, hadn't talked to anybody about it, and now they saw I was doing this book and they and they needed to get it off their chest. They needed to talk about it. I would go. I met these two, these two girls who were daughters of one of the guys who became a snitch, testified against the corporation. The family went into the witness protection program. These girls had never talked to anybody. When I met, went to meet with them in a bar. They weren't even sure they were going to talk to me. We were just meeting to talk about whether they were going to talk to me. I got to meet them. They talk nonstop for three hours and once they thought they could trust me, they just, they couldn't stop talking about it. They had all the stuff they needed to get off their chest. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:22:43       Raised. Not to say God's God's the first raid. I saw my mother, I was five. They sat me on the couch and read. My mother had already thrown the coke off about the until the lady downstairs, the landlord had already called her and said, the cops are on the way out the door. We lived on the west side, terrorists facing a new New Jersey, and the lady, she would pay her rent and tell a hold this bag. My mother through it, they came up, sat is down. They asked the subway, went to Ada Street, 88th street. We never got raided. When I moved to North Bergen, I would get raided before I got ready to the phone would ring and become. I know that your mom had cleaned the house. I'd wake my mom up to clean the house and come over here. I don't want you to see what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Cops would come and arrest my mother. I would walk the columbines obs with my basketball right past the cops and it was that easy. It was that easy. Wow. Do you wish you ran into joey before you started writing this? It would've been a different book. He wanted. Why I enjoyed this book so much is because no matter how much history this motherfucker dropped on you, he let you know Jose Battle was. He kept you. Remind them who's Jose Battle was. That's big for an author. He never got away from Jose battle and when you read the book, no matter what type of person you are, you kind of get mad at Jose battle, but there's something about Jose battery life cause you. You want that guy in your corner. If you knew Jose battle and you knew that he got in the truck and say, I'm going out there for my men, that's the guy I want with me all the time. What am I going to hang out with this fucking idiot? He gets scattered. If an ambulance goes by, this guy actually went out and saved that guys. So he had that Cuban loyalty that Anti Castro Cubans. Shit. That's big. So growing up there was so many things I wasn't allowed to. I wasn't even allowed to talk about. Now, here's how ruthless this guy. Well, let me, let me, let, let you answer the question though. Do you wish that you would run into joe?

Speaker 1:          01:24:46       Ah, yes I do, but the thing that fears me, there was so much research to do in this book. If I would have met Joey, I would have gone down a rabbit hole with joey stories and that might've taken me off this specific research I was doing, so I almost joey joey's thing is like a separate thing. It's almost like a a sequel to or a sub or a son. The son of the corporation, sort of a spinoff of it and there's a lot of people probably who have their version of it like joey does that they could tell, so yeah. But let me say about battle because Joey St, very interesting thing. How charismatic he was and how you partly liked him and admired him, which was was the, is the case of any good leader, right? That's what you want from a leader. But here's how ruthless this guy was.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       He had a guy in his organization or Nesto Torres, Ernesto, who he met in Spain. Battle was on the run in Madrid for a brief period of time when he'd been indicted on gambling charges and there were a bunch of Cubans living over there and they all hung out together and he. He discovered this 19 year old kid named Ernesto Torres, who was sort of an orphan and one day he tells the kid he's going to mentor the kid. One day, tells the kid, I've got a guy coming this afternoon to the apartment. I want you to watch. He owes me $10,000. I'm going to scare the shit out of this guy. I want you to see what you do, how you treat somebody who owes you money, show them that they can't play around with you. So he's waiting for the guy to come over battle and he's sitting in his apartment and here's a pop pop from out in the street.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       He goes down, he goes out. Earnest Eco. Nineteen year old is there with a gun in his hand. He's shot the guy in the backseat of the cab arriving to meet with battling, killing him. And he says, uh, Padrino Godfather. He says, you'll never have a problem with this guy again. I took care of it and battles looking at it going, Ugh, you just cost me $10,000. I didn't want the guy dead. Uh, but then again, he looks at her and he thinks I can use. I can use this guy, I can use this guy. So earnest ego becomes what he calls his protocol son. And he grooms this guy to maybe be the next Godfather. When they come back to New Jersey, they come back to union city. He, he sends this Guy Ernest, he go out there and no one else in the corporation can understand battles. Affection for this guy they think are in a tequilas thug.

Speaker 1:          01:27:12       He's a killer. He's a street dog. Yeah, the organization can use guys like that, but you don't put him in positions of authority. Battle scene have a soft spot for this guy. He makes earnest tico a banker. He makes the other bankers bank roll, uh, put up $10,000 each so that earnest can be a banker. They don't like it. Most of them don't like it, but they go along with a couple of them. Don't go along with it. Ernest ego doesn't have the brains to be a banker. He fails miserably as a banker. He's humiliated by that. And so what he does, he starts kidnapping bankers from the organization and holding them for money, very self destructive thing to do. He turns against the organization. He goes rogue. One of them is shoots a banker. He kidnaps and shoots happens to be paddles, brother-in-law. The bankers come to Jose Miguel battle.

Speaker 1:          01:28:00       They say, you, you created this, this fucking monster. You brought this kid in. You created them. You got to take care of it. That'll be in the man. He is. Realizes that that's true. It's his responsibility. He hires a few assassins to try to take her in St. Cloud. They bomb his car in union city. They tried to kill him. They can't get the job done. Battle decides he's got to do the thing himself. By this time, Ernest Tico has fled to Miami. He's hiding out with his girlfriend in OPA. Locka battle gets together, his brother, one of his brothers and another assassin, Chino Akuna and a day go down to. They go down to Miami and in the middle of the afternoon they burst in this guy, they find out where he as a person, his apartment, they engage in a wild shootout with her and it's Tico and they shoot him in the closet of his bedroom at battle, goes in, grabs him by the hair and shoots him right ripe. It puts a bullet right between his eyes. Now that's a boss. I mean, aside from the horrible nature of the act, that's a leader. That's a guy who

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       takes matters into his own hands. He wants something done. He goes and does it himself and uses that as an example for the organization. He comes back to the bosses, the bankers in New York. He says, you're not going to have a problem with with ernest eco anymore. He says, you know what? He died like a lion. He fought to the death. He empty. He fought until he'd empty his gun and shot him in the closet. So he's telling all the other backers, I still admire the kid. He fought like a lion, but I took care of it. It's done. And you know the other, the other belief the bankers were in. We're in awe of this guy because he had a certain ability to do that, that they didn't have this in the book. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's pictures of it in the blue. What was the logic to take this thug and tournament to a banker in the first place?

Speaker 5:          01:29:49       He had a soft spot for him. Battle was a sentimentalist. He took in stray dogs. He drive around this. He'd drive around and he'd see a dog on the street and he'd open the door and he'd say, come if the dog come. He took the dog in and in his home in Miami as a state in Miami. He had like 25 stray dogs. Wow. And uh, they said Ernest Tico is like a stray dog. He had a soft spot for the kid before I piss real quick. Don't. Cube with a dog is a big symbol. My toys was real big circle care. When Michael Vick got convicted, there was a lot of jails. He couldn't be center because they had an adequate population and they don't play when it comes to dog because the devotion is to St Laszlo Way. St Lazarus who got these, the ones with the crutches that got his licks and, and then his by there was a lot like you bro, when people would say that whether you bring art and Joel is on the real because I love these motherfuckers and fuck you.

Speaker 5:          01:30:46       You got a problem for you. You know what I'm saying? That's what he was. He was very loyal and uh, until you, until you turned onto the attorney. But you know, they almost canceled the sopranos. The HBO got really pissed at the Sopranos. Episode seven when he drives his daughter to the school and he kills the guy personally because hbo felt that bosses should never do heads. That was, he did that over time. Hbo Film, Hbo felt they were, that they were that chase. Fuck this Ross Greenberg. They will chase and said, we don't think in real life a boss maybe went and he picked up the guy by his neck when he drove a whatever, willow, the college that the hbo threatened the Sopranos, not the add that episode to cut that, to make somebody else killed a guy that wasn't the only guy. Was that because they wanted Tony Soprano. They still wanted them to be some sort of a hero. They didn't understand that he wanted to keep your hands clean. Then the ridiculous because that was one of the more appealing things about that show that show he was a murderer. But you still like no, at the end that he killed Pilou to uh, he tried to cut his leg off me. Tell you a little on fire

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and tell you that. Let Me Go pee real quick. The police story, political killed battles brother. His youngest brother in a dispute shot him in a, in a bar in Washington heights. Very public murder. I mean as an insult to the battle family. So now Jose Miguel battle is fucking livid. And at the funeral in union city, he gathers his men together and he says, you know, I want this guys, I want this guys head on the wall. I want, I want to be able to mount this guy's head on my wall. And uh, he, he puts out a hit on this guy for $100,000 and this is in the seventies. So you know, that's probably a million. It's probably a million dollars. A earnest equals the one that takes on ernest take on another assassin are the ones that take on that contract and they go out trying to get pilou.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       I mentioned before, there's something like nine attempts or 12 attempts on Palooz life. They had a shoot out in central park with machine guns in the middle of the afternoon. Holy Shit, guys with machine guns shooting with mothers with baby carriages and stuff. Palooza got shot up so bad. He loses his leg. He winds up having to have a prosthetic leg. They still go after Pilou. One pilou goes to prison. They hire a killer to stab him in the prison yard twice, two separate times. And He survived that. He keeps surviving and he survived. So many of these assassination attempts, they, they, they think he's not human. They come to believe that he's got some sense santeria spirit who's protecting him. So when you think someone has this, I was still, he was here for this. When you have someone you think has a Santeria spirit protecting them, you have to counter that with a center.

Speaker 1:          01:33:40       He a spirit of your own. You have to have what's called the Bombay, where you were, you were. You create a, a kind of Voodoo energy to kill this guy. So they. So they continue to go after poodle. Finally battle as he did with Ernest [inaudible] says, I'm going to take matters into my own hands. I'm going to. I'm going to be there on this one. They find out where Pilou is in the Bronx and they go on one night and they trap him. They see cars come from all sides. They trap him. He gets out of his car, they shoot him in the street, they shoot them full of 11 bullets. He falls in the street, a bleeding loaded with gunshots. The last thing he sees is Jose Miguel battle standing over him, laughing at him, and then he goes unconscious in the street. They think, great, he's dead. They're almost ready to celebrate. The following morning they find out now polluted was rushed to the hospital. He's not dead. He's recovering now. They're beside themselves. What corneal. They've tried everything. They've tried everything. Uh, they say, you know what? We're not going to give up. They hire an assassin. Dress him up as a male nurse. He goes into the hospital, shoots Pilou in his, in his hospital bed right between the eyes and it got to. They got the job done. He was talking when you were gone,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       about how if you felt like a guy had a Santa Ria spirit protecting them, you had to have your own Santa Maria to come back to combat it. Santa Ria became a scam after. Well, like I was raised in Santa Maria from the age of five. I had little disturbances when my dad died. I was weak. I didn't. They didn't put me into Santa Ria to be a witch. Doctor explained Santa Maria to people who don't know what, it's a religion that originated in Africa, Nigeria, and then the slaves brought it over to Cuba. They hit it from the plantation owners through Catholicism, so that's why there's a lot of cross. It's kind of a mixture of African Catholic Catholic religion. When I was five I was brought up to 148th street and this lady had a collie dog and I loved the Cali. I love dogs and I was allergic to them, so while I was playing with the dog, she would talk to me and I fell in love with this woman.

Speaker 2:          01:35:53       I fell in love with her. She was like my mother and then as I got older, one that they asked me, do you want this? Do you want that? Do you want to get like, wow. Which is the first one you get at like Wildo Goon, Yoel Romero. Those are the first things you get and you put them by your door and they guarantee you know your safety. For me it was health. That big black woman who is my godmother. Okay. And then after that, when I was six, they finally said they were going to initiate me and my mother because my spirit took my father. Wow. So they wanted my godmother. They wanted me and my mother to be twins in the Santa Maria. So I made st 148th street and Broadway and. But for me it wasn't to be a killer or would it be anything like that?

Speaker 2:          01:36:44       I can't carry guns. I can't go in cars with strange people. I can't do business with three people. I can't say. I hope Jamie fucking gets hit by a car. I'm not allowed to say all those things. I don't use it the way in the late 17 you do business with three people because two of them will sidle up against you. And that's the same thing that happened to me on my kidnapping. I rob somebody with three people. I can't stay in everything. I look at my life now look at my life when I was a white powder, my st in my head is controlled. Like that's why I always wearing a white t shirt on Mondays. It's a day of this. You always wear a white t shirt or Monday. Look at my shoes. White on white. Always when I step out of the shower I walk on totally on our mat everyday, everyday, everyday.

Speaker 2:          01:37:31       I'm still very Santa Maria in my head. I wasn't when I was doing the coke because I knew I wasn't allowed to. What happened in the in the mid seventies with St Dharia was I would pay you to tell me what you wanted to hear. Listen, I got a big cargo coming in from Columbia with 100 kilos. What will the St say I do? It's fucking religion. They don't fucking transport blow, but these people got enamored with it, so it was like, you know a Dj, you know, I want to kill Joe Rogan. Let me put a spouse and you're supposed to write your name on a thing and then take a tongue and put it in the cow's tongue. Like there was a big story when I was a kid for dotty. One of a story that he's in the book. He's Omega Seven. I didn't know this growing up.

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       He went to court one time and his godmother made a powder and before the judge went to make a verdict, she splayed the power and the thing and the judge fucking couldn't remember what the fuck he was about to say, dismissed the case and she became a star after that. Every fucking criminal wanting to give her thousands of dollars. What was the powder like a thing they made. There's a movie they called years ago. It was a the devil's advocate with a with Keanu reeves and Pachino and there's one scene where he has to go protect the guy. The guy's a Santa Ria guy. New York is prosecuting him because he's killing animals without a license and he goes, watch this. He takes a tongue and he puts the tongue down. He blasts the tongue with like a thing and then he says. He asked the guy what's the judge's name?

Speaker 2:          01:39:10       And the judge gave him his name and he took the tongue and they roll it with nails and then they put it away and they go, don't worry about tomorrow. The next day at court, the judge starts to fucking talk and he goes and pull up coughing. Spring. He can't fucking talk. Now that person looks like a hero. These are all subtle coincidence that these fucking specs for fueled by now. So now I gotta I got have a big week. Joe Rogan. What is the St say you get four pieces of coconut. You throw them on the floor and the St say this is going to be your week. Let me give you a $20,000. So now drug dealers started doing it with Noriega got busted. He had Santa Maria in his closet. Fidel was well known for Santa Maria and his closet dudes. Well, they have a. You have a special moment.

Speaker 2:          01:39:58       You have an altar. I made a promise when I lived in that apartment that have got. If about the law, got me a house, he would have his own room. Go to my house. My St isn't my office right behind me. I'm not an author and I also have a few. If you get into the Cuban thing, it will get you. We'll get it will get you. It's so cute from reading this book I have. I haven't to have an. You have to have like, why's my. He's a little boy. You do this. It's a belief system. Why did you do? Because you can't really understand a culture unless you embrace it on some level. You understand it and live it. Unless you continued even after the book. Oh yeah. I've had people talk to me when I've thrown cards or by you throwing cards about when people have done my readings.

Speaker 2:          01:40:44       They have mentioned you in my readings really that you're around the euro. A lot of sun all the way to the end. What does that mean about the lives on the old wise, he has 24 different passages. He goes my passages or Jago? Nah, that's the one you don't want around because they were supposed to push out and go in my head, but the time me down, I wish I chunk. Chunk. Go means thunder. Whenever you see thundery shit, that's Chango. Chango is a bad and a woman. You can't kill mice around him. They beheaded them because a mouse woke him up and he woke up and Oh, it's fucked. You have no idea. And is the drum the Conga drum, which is to thunder. Summoning the thunder. Yeah. So they put a box in my head to calm me down. I'm not supposed to carry weapons.

Speaker 2:          01:41:32       I can't have knives on me. I can't get into arguments. My mother in the same dot, Chung. She's just a whore. She's just a tune. Is the horror of the same. She gave him a kid. So yeah, my Yada res. If you have problems with your stomach or you want to have a kid, you have to pray it or chew you know. But the women's saints have worse than the male saints. You don't fuck around with the women sayings because they will fuck your world up tune is probably Mary Magdalen. Yes. And My. I sent a message to my mother. My Mother didn't do it. My mother died, you know, he says that there's a, a, another side to the story and you know, like I told him the last time we have this Michael, my mother had made for years. They sent me the sacred heart school for boys.

Speaker 2:          01:42:21       Yeah, she sent me that a good education, but she sent me that because it was a lot of shit she didn't want me to say at that time and when I got a Catholic school I was introduced to it and one of the things I got introduced in one night was the end of union city. The end of that political era where everything was running smooth came to an end, like in 76. That's when allegations started to come up because there was two cops that would shake my mother down. Very decent people. They would come in when I came well dressed, would have a drink, talk to my mother in Spanish. My mother would feed him. It was a price of doing business, Joe Rogan. Now, here's how I knew joey was legit because when we first started communicating, he mentioned the name of one of these cops and that name is in the book, uh, Frank Mona, a well known cop in union city at the time, so I knew right away to your house and you had $200,000, only 100,000 dollars and make it to the police station. So my step father Juan wanted to kill him. He confiscated ones lecture to 25. That was like, for, you know, like when Tony Montana picks up Michelle five and he goes, what is God lack, let me tell you. So you could put a porsche, the best portion of the world and the 1975 cadillac makes to a Cuban and he's going to take the cadillac because that's, that's a scheme that's radical. That's what it is to be fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:43:51       When Mona took that Cadillac from one, he didn't shut up about that for 10 years. He wants to shoot that fucking cop. But that cop was a clean cut. There was a dirty cop and he always busted my mother's balls, but he wouldn't come in for the shakedowns. It was two other guys thought about 76. This guy started coming out and that kind of looked like a, like Jim Morrison, Cuban, good looking dude when another white partner and they would come in and they would yell at my mother and my mom had a bar, the pool table on the back and then she had a main office. If she had to take a number or somebody might have to play a number. She rented an apartment. She owned the building, so she rented the apartment upstairs that had a line to the back so you couldn't follow them saying 10 so you could choose to the back office.

Speaker 2:          01:44:42       I was in that back office one day and I heard yelling and I came outside and this cop was pressuring my mother saying, fuck you. We know what the fuck you're doing. We want our money. Now. At that time, union city ran from seven to 48th street and there was a bunch of bars. Was a cafe. The cafe of artists at Brean d, these are all well known Cuban book, your spot and this guy started torturing Cubans and the Cubans were like, what the fuck is going on? We pay and all of a sudden this guy, but will piss the Cubans off the most was that this guy was cute. His name was nicky Gerardo, and he was, you know what happened and this kept on and one day I'm in. I used to go to Mckinley school and I would walk up to my mother's bar and one day I walked up there and every one of those Cuban owners were in there drinking fucking yelling and that Castro Shit. There was one way before the subprime was his name was treating. That means sad pussy. He owned the club on 35th street. Now in union city, you also have to remember there's a bar called the bottom of the barrel and if you read any mafia books, the bottom of the barrels and every mafia book, it sounds. It's where Henry Hill hung out. Dominic, Montego Leo and Nino Gaji. It's right there. I'm bergenline avenue. So all this was going on and you didn't sit. So he's the real fucking deal. Okay. It's real now. Fucking. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:46:11       Now before we get off Santa Maria. Uh, yeah. I told you the story about Ernest tico right after an stk who got murdered and they searched his apartment. They found a bunch of tapes. He had been taping phone conversations with all the people around him and he taped some conversations with his mother packing Kua. Ernest Eagle knew he was hunt a hunted man. He, they had been attempts. He was hiding out in a phone conversation with his mother like three days before they got him. He's talking with his mother and she says, I know. I'm worried. I know they're trying to get you. I'm worried. I knew I'm going to do a bay to try to protect you. And he says, yeah, I need it. You know, he says, I'm caught in the middle of a war of the saints. I'm caught in the middle of a war of the saints.

Speaker 1:          01:46:56       And she says, I need some new names for my mba. And he names the people who have been been a, a ceremony, uh, you know, a ceremonial summoning of the spirits for one purpose or another, and she was above allow a priestess. Um, so he gives her the very people who are after him, Jose Miguel battle, he says a Chino or Konya, he names all the people who are trying to kill him. So there's mother can use those names in her ceremony. So when the cops find this, obviously the Bombay didn't work because they killed that, got to ernest tico and killed them. But on the other hand, when the cops found this tape, it was like Ernestine covas speaking from the dead and fingering his, the people who killed him and they were able to use that as evidence. They knew exactly who killed him because of that tape conversation with

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       Blah, blah, blah. So how the fuck do I fit in the Santa Maria? What do you on a couple of years ago I had to read some guy told me that you have a couple of strong above a lot of people in your life and that's definitely you. You're older and wiser guy. You're not violent or very controlled. You're a lot more controlled than I am, which is more of A. I lean towards the jungle phase. My, my main thing is a Jago now yoga, when I was younger by the law, he's the one that took a sword and wipe it on his chest with red and they asked them why, uh, did he liked to kill him? He said, because blood makes change. Something stupid. He really has, but I don't practice that. I don't. My brother was very calm, but one, one guy goes, Caesar, he's a bad ass. Motherfucker hit mentioned, didn't mention your name, didn't need that. Don't need to mention that. Once they tell me, I already know what they're talking about, I already know what they're talking about. So I still go get readings. Like when I go to Miami, next time I go to my godmother. See, this is the reason. One thing I might ask, I still

Speaker 1:          01:49:05       follow it. This is the reason I still follow. You were asking me why, why I would still follow it. It's because once you get to an understanding of the idea that there are certain spirits within you and the Orishas represent different spirits, once you understand that that's not something you throw away. Even if you don't follow the religion anymore, you still, you still have belief in that. He's still believe in that. So my Orisha is Elegua. Elegua is the saint e's. A trickster. Elegua is a trickster, plays little tricks and also the saint of passages. So people put elegua above their door because you're passing from one room into another room and so you identify that spirit

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       and that becomes part of your identity. You can whistle in the house. Why? Why you can't whistle in the house? Yeah, I don't listen. You can go in the house because he'll leave. So you can't fuck them whistling. Can't whistle. No. Wow. When I was a kid, I'd sit at the table and do. Yeah, you can't wait. So my mom was go touch that fucking table is gonna wake your fucking head because God lives on the table now. Joe. I grew up in it. They made st to me like the one when I made St Louis in November and they ended up in the Bronx River, so they had to break the ice and they were dark skinned Cubans and I'll never forget that. They rip your clothes off and then they take whatever you're saying. They hit you with the number of water, so if you're st is five, you get hit with five things with water and they dry you out, you're freezing and when I saw them ripping my mother's clothes on, I was about five.

Speaker 2:          01:50:45       I'm like, fuck you. Black motherfuckers started running down Bronx Boulevard. They had to chase me and bring me back. I didn't want to do it. It's an all night ceremony night on a Friday. It was crazy all night. Twelve hours long sleep and then Sunday is when they read your future to you and then for a week you just live in a corner. White. They paint your head, you're bald. I had to go back to school on Monday, bald with a hat. They said he's not allowed in here with a hat. My mother gave the principals small nickel and I was allowed to wear the hat from nine to three, but then at 3:00 I had to go home and change into white clothes for a year, not allowing for a year. I had to dress in white now year, so for my calls I would just have to wear white socks and white tee shirts because I was a kid.

Speaker 2:          01:51:34       I can't keep wearing fucking white every damn. I'm ripping shit right so that your hair has to grow back. So when I walk into, I know there's a ton of Santa Maria and La Really, I don't deal with it at all because it's all the same thing. Like everything else in their life. It's a bunch of white people didn't grow up in it and there's a hot black guy and they want to really just suck his dick and he's talking about spirits. Saw a video today. I saw a video. I'm like, shame on them. It's all confused. It's like those white chicks that sucked. That Hindu Dick, when they go to hot yoga, that guy that's got a bit grumpy is a pig. You've got is a bunch of white chicks or hummus flavor in there from something that he gets to me inside you. You suck that fucking. That smells like hummus chips, you know, and that's what it is in La. Like I've been invited to two parties.

Speaker 2:          01:52:28       First Time I went, you know who's in there? Who fucking the dude from that played in the Yummy forest? Forest, Whitaker Santa Real. Is He really the chick that won Miss America for eating pussy from behind the scenes in the Santa Maria. Maria. Oh Vanessa, my Santa Ria. I grew up in a Cuban Santa Ria. You shut your fucking mouth because it's not cute. Is it Mexican influence? This is why they're just like, oh my God, look at that. Look at forest. It's very watered down. And look at the guy from forest whitaker dressed up like fucking monks do pop a plate that I came up under the very strict. Shut your mouth. Nobody needs to know you fucking business to fill a role. It was his step and this is what it is here. It's more of a of a, you know, like whenever at the guy that I, the guy that gives me the reeds is tremendous.

Speaker 2:          01:53:40       I'm going to tell you this man to man. Tremendous. Really tremendous. I even took Duncan tool. Tremendous. You took Duncan, does she? We had him on the podcast and everything. The problem with him is I don't like his people around him. He has too many people that don't know. When I joined this I knew what I was getting myself into. Right. You know what I'm saying? Like I knew, I knew I liked it. I had nothing to do with my mother. I was to do with my godmother and I. and it was my relationship with her. In fact, my mother couldn't even say shit to me in front of my godmother when, when an 85 I, I might, when I moved in with the vendors, I couldn't bring my Santa Ria shit with them. They're fucking aliens. So I left it with this gay guy named Martin.

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       The fact my thing money go. You sold coke at night. He was, uh, he was, uh, a seamstress in the daytime for a big New York play, but when I was a kid, he would go to cbgbs every night and so coke use all these fags walking around and Felicia give thanks to Martin. He was getting his teeth knocked out and black eyes back in the seventies because he was gay. But I liked one. I ended up my, I left my St Martin and then years later they ended up Robin Martin, my cocaine fucking hell. So my godmother asked me in 1,985, whereas you're saying, so I go there at Martin's house. She goes, you know, you're not supposed to have. You're saying to the gay man's house. I'll go get him. Listen to me. I never saw my godmother going have 95. I did A. I talked to Duncan about Santa Maria and some company approached me from London and I did the Santa Ria podcasts and I got an email on twitter.

Speaker 2:          01:55:20       We know who has you, saints. They're in Miami. Thirty four years later I flew to Miami. I got my son to get him. I flew together, shifting back, you know how my godmother got him to Miami out on a bus. Whoa. So six cases on a bus with all your future and your stuff. I got my notebook. If you look at my notebook, I bring my notebook next time. And you reading your go. Joe Knew Shit. These motherfuckers really? Oh yeah. So you, you, you, you believe there's something to it. I till the age of 11, I thought there were a bunch of Hocus pocus motherfuckers, but there was a lady on 20, sixth and central and I grew up with her kids. Her husband was that big book in on an Eighteenth Street and once a month she passed the spirit and people would go there. 10 people who were invited and I could tell this cop was eating away at my mother.

Speaker 2:          01:56:18       First of all, my mother didn't lay down for nobody. My mother was going to shoot that motherfucker herself. She'd, if she was that type of Cuban woman. She didn't like being spoken to that way I could see it in their face. It was eating him alive and one night we went over to this way or these party. The first time I saw the lady drink a bottle of fire water, you know, that hundred and 40 proof Agua dam thing. So I thought, this is bullshit. This is bullshit. This is she MCS that bottle out in the daytime. So at night I would watch her bottles and they had the label like they were sealed because I had my mother had a bar so I knew if they were sealed in a pro, just women would pass the spirit and then tell you what to do and what not to do.

Speaker 2:          01:57:00       On this particular night, she went up to my mother. She goes, I know what's bothering you. And she took a white dish, took a white dish. That was just the way she took a candle and she turned it over and she went like this, this circular motion on the camera. I was 10 or 11 Joe Rogan at that time that I believe I don't believe in Dick. I didn't believe in Dick. I didn't believe in Jesus. I don't give a fuck. It's a story they tell you. She flipped over the dish and it was a circle with a guy that looked like a beer and she goes, this was bothering you. And my mother goes, yeah. She goes, and she broke the dishes. She goes, seven days, they will never bother you again.

Speaker 2:          01:57:42       Four days later, go look it up. Nikki Gerardo was his name. They shot them a thousand fucking times at a place called Rapido taxi. It was a front. There was a taxi thing that was a front for a cocaine. They deliver cocaine. Ropey don't means quick. They never had a customer that caps. He wants to make a collection. They were waiting for the one you told me about you, Geraldo. They said they got the witness wasn't no witness was the union city cops who shot. Wow. Because he went by. It's like if and you have partners and also that come around and start collecting from jail. That's how corrupt the system. And in the papers they said he died to hear all that. He was shot by a street criminal and he was given her heroes. Perio. No. And Joey says he was shot by other. No, they know. They always knew the city. Was that dirty? Did you hear this when you were doing your research? No, I didn't. When I told him that he told me and I did some research on it, found out that the guy, I read the public account of

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       what happened and it was quite different than what, how joey describes it. That was the cops and Charlotte because he's taken. And that's what I was saying before about the what the story we see on the surface and then the real story underneath. See, I know all those stores don't like the after that, the political system. And in his book he has a section where you actually see battle go to the police station and to make payoffs like that's how easy it was. You know, battle got arrested in north Bergen in my hometown. So I called one of my friends. I go do some research on it. They said they never even put the cops on him.

Speaker 1:          01:59:23       He owned the town. He owned the town, the mayor and the police chief. And if you all you need to say they both went to prison eventually for taking money from the gambling. From. Yeah. No Mayor Jamie, when you got a minute. No Man has ever left Hudson county. If it's not through prison, the whole, the male, the fact Guinea, he died because it was 800 pounds. Every other man ends up in jail. My. The fact that Mary Union city is up for corruption charges as we speak. And this is what, 30 years later I read that. I read that recently. It's never stopped Joe Rogan. It's never ever stopped. That's why when people tell me stories, I wipe my ass. And also this is when you say organized crime is diminished while we're talking about organized crime, right? It's still there. It's deeply rooted in the system in certain jurisdictions and it's not going to change.

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       It's just crazy to me that you got so deeply entrenched reading the story that you started getting into Santa Maria. I was actually until I was married to a Brazilian for 10 years. So they have a center. It's called my coma. And what's different about their. It's almost exactly the same and they have all the same saints. It's the same thing. Same thing because the slave trade came through Brazil, Africa, Catholicism mixing. They, they just. The music is different with the Cubans. It's a Roomba. All this wonderful room by music that you hear. There's a whole bunch of great music that grows up around it. So you were married to a Brazilian woman. You get divorced to keep the religion because that would happen. Uh, yeah. I, I was. I can't go to places like Cuba and Brazil because I get so influenced and overwhelmed by it. It changes the direction my life really. I went to Brazil for the first full day. I was in Brazil. I fell in love with the woman that I married and lived with for the next 10 years. Wow. When I go to Cuba, it's dangerous to me because I'm so seduced by it. I'm so intoxicated by Havana. By Cuban culture. What is it?

Speaker 1:          02:01:34       Well, first of all, it's the most sensual place you have. Van is the most sensual place I've ever been. Everyone flirts. The women flirt. Doesn't matter if they're married or not married. They flirt with you. I suppose guys flirt to everyone flirts. There's like sexual energy everywhere. The Sky in the and the climate is just kind of sold tree in and sensual. The music is. Makes your body move.

Speaker 2:          02:02:02       Joe, would you let me play a video for you to show you some of the dancing and Cuba? Sure. When women dancing Cuba, they cover their pussy

Speaker 2:          02:02:14       because what I'm trying to do, the whole dance is me baiting you. It's the prettiest things you've ever seen in your life. It's me coming up to you with this movement. Like when I played it like ul, I was getting nowhere with Joelle. I was way before the podcast. He was tightening up so I had a play. They'll papinas my size and once he heard that I could see Nigeria coming alive. He even got up and kicked his leg one time, which meant we're on because it's so embedded in your culture, but in Cuban dancing, I'm coming up to you. Every time I come up and I'll go like this, and you go like this. Yeah, you got to come and put your ass, but the whole time you'll be covering your pussy because on the exchange I go to grab your pussy.

Speaker 1:          02:03:06       Harvey Weinstein would do phenomenal. Here's how serious I take it. By the way, what is this? Oh, I, I love. I love Afro Cuban music or Latin Jazz, so I'm hosting, I'm curating and hosting a Latin jazz series in New York at a bar called sync every Thursday night, Tj English and his Latin jazz explosions. So I get to choose the music, the musicians who performed there, and I and I host the evening. Wow. You do this every week? Yeah. What we're going to try to just keep. Keep it going indefinitely. That's phenomenal. So this to you was a natural subject to sort of engross yourself? Well, I had written, I had published the book Havana Nocturne, which was about the mob in Cuba in the fifties and I really got into it. Then I made numerous trips to savannah for extended periods. So this book was almost like a sequel to that.

Speaker 1:          02:03:59       Yeah, it was a nice way to revisit that culture. Pick up the thread of that story because this one is sort of an answer. You get to the end and a Havana nocturne and you ask yourself, so then what happened? What happened after the mafia got chased out of Cuba? What was their response? How did they take it? I want to show you this. The Cuban dancing. What does it say? What's the name of the watch? To see how everything is. Look, look at this. Uh, yeah. Just keeps buzzing. So it was always about navy.

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       Watch him move. So talking about genes, about what was it with your health. See he went to grab a pussy. So the dance, a seduction, seduction, they're both there. They're engaged in a mutual seduction. This is a crazy dance. Jamie, what's the name of this? Show it to me. Grandma. Say that co is the rhythm is the real you a whole lot more. And Ketos Ketos, m u n e Q, u I t o s d, my times up times. This is the province that. Wow. Watch how she grabs a pussy. Every time he comes close

Speaker 5:          02:05:29       now that mute, grab it, grab it. And she blocked it. Oh yeah, they don't fuck around. That's hilarious. So the drumming you're hearing and the use of what's called the Shaker Array, that Gord there and the chanting that's going on that you would all, you would hear all that in Santeria ceremony. Wow. This grabbing the pussy shit is hilarious. Hilarious. Hilarious. Yeah. He kept trying to grab his junk to occasionally, occasionally. But he's probably just checking how are we doing down there? See like he's grabbing it. He's like squeezing it to see if it's hard to say. He's just playing with it. He just threatened the grab and she grabbed it. That's hilarious. So it's very playful. Flirtatious. And this is the culture there. That's Cuba. You know, it's funny.

Speaker 2:          02:06:13       And Five. I lived in a building in Fort Lee and there was a Panamanian woman and she told me that she went to Cuba twice as a young girl and she wasn't surprised what was going on in Cuba. That was God's punishment. She goes, it was such a disgusting fucking place. And then it was weird. Couple of days after I'm talking to Tj, a, somebody on facebook. I did a joke for my CSO special about club 38. The owner name was Willie Vandy, and his claim to fame was that his grandfather had the biggest dick in Cuba. I grew up with two kids that her claim to fame. One of them, his dad was the best pool player in Cuba and Americans will go down and he'd beat the fuck out of him and pull you play. They played Chicago eight ball whenever Chicago. The other. His claim to fame was that his grandfather was the guy in godfather two who had the big Dick and they called him superman and on Saturday nights at club 38 in union city. He would on Saturdays, he recreated and he had people come down and it'd be like a comedy show. $10 ticket in 200 people. He would get some out chick tire up to Cubans like that would play the congas and he come out and fuck the lady and

Speaker 5:          02:07:30       go crazy with the biggest dick in the world and my job fucker in public. That was the whole thing. I was like, fuck, show. That was a public fuck show. But it went all the way back to Cuba to like 55, like the name of the place was Shanghai, the Shanghai Theater, and the Godfather to Michael takes. They take Michael there and all of a sudden he goes, I would have never found this place if it wasn't for Johnny Ola. And that's when Michael finds out that he betrayed them. So they don't show the guys that have been simpler. If the guy with the big Dick was also the greatest pool player because he could just, Oh my God, that would have been perfect. So they did this article about two weeks ago. It's on my facebook and it's called in search of Superman Joe Rogan. It was the most disgusting article rather than my life that these white dudes went on a 50 year looking for superman.

Speaker 5:          02:08:24       The legend of the guy with the big thick. In fact, do vow went to Cuba, to the location, even though it's closed, just to see where it was and what the story is that us as Americans will go down to every week. And that was our first time to see this big black Cuban dude. Fuck the shit out of some poor white chick, you know, yelled and screamed. The place was sold out every night. I mean, the guy was a gardener. The article is sensational if you could find it. It's called in search of Superman and they is it better than superman. But when it came out the same week that they said, what are you fucking crazy. They ain't no fake. That's real. That's why they call him superman. Afraid of the know. I saw. I saw a video of Superman when I was researching Havana Nocturne.

Speaker 5:          02:09:13       Uh, I found out that Santo traffic content had a lawyer named Samara Ghana since deceased. But Samara, Ghana used to take a lot of super eight videos when he'd go down to Cuba. His son, who's currently a lawyer in Tampa told me that he had super eight footage of superman that his father had made in the fifties, superman at a private sex show. Fucking a girl. And I said, oh, I got to see that. Could I see that? I mean, I think that's the only existing video footage anywhere of Superman and he said, yeah, but I'm not going to give it up. You've got to come to Tampa and I'll show it for you. So I go down there. I'll never forget. He's a lawyer too. He says you got to come at 6:00 after the. After the office closes so then we can watch it and I get there and the cleaning lady is still there, so he brings me into the conference room where he's going to show me the family. We got to sit there and wait until the cleaning lady's done because he didn't want to put this film all the while. The cleaning ladies in the room, so he puts it on the plate. Stuff is completely empty and he shows me this footage and his father had scored it to like Wagner or beethoven like triumph and classical music and it's. It's at a private show. It's in somebody's home. They had private sex salons in Havana where you'd go to like some rich person's house.

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       You'd pay some money, you had cocktails, and then someone had clap at a certain time and you knew that was time for the show and everyone would sit down and superman would come out and he, he, he fucked this, a Cuban woman who was, who was small, he was begging, she was small and he's banging her from every conceivable angle. It was the least sexy thing you've ever seen in your life. I mean, it looked like a, it looked like some kind of torture really. Uh, and that was it. And this guy had this footage, which is probably worth a lot of money. Big was the Dick. The Dick was big.

Speaker 1:          02:11:14       It wasn't. No, I say that because it wasn't like, it wasn't a, I'm not sure it was even the biggest stick I've ever seen. I mean, it was bigger than my dad's. Bigger than normal. It was bigger than the guys today. It's almost like athletes, like if you go back and look at when Jim Brown was playing football, he was very impressive. But was he Herschel Walker? You know what I'm saying? Like athletes have today's era or different. And if you go back and look at John Holmes, yeah, he had a big Dick, but was it Lexington steel, you know, like these guys have bigger dicks now. But the people on the board vets people are growing. The thing that freaked me out of the human species is advancing fancy. But then that about Santo that I enjoyed from your first book event in October and I wanted to tell Joe to stories that one time Kennedy went to cast a Cuba as a senator and they were having some type of meeting but fucking Kennedy can focus right?

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       And that they like, what the fuck is wrong with him in St Louis for Cathy goes, I know exactly what's wrong. Come on. And they tapped him on the shoulder and they bring them in a room. He's embellishing this a little is better. This is what I remember I read and that I guess Santo, he's sic them onto women candidates while he set up a. They filmed it. He said no, they didn't film it. They wish they wish they had filmed that. They said they set him up in a room with a two way mirror and they watched it happening and then one of them turned the other and said, Shit, we should've filmed this. This would make great blackmail material. Right? Like, Santo is kind of a freak.

Speaker 1:          02:12:50       JFK, the freakiest the freaks, right? Yeah. Well, but you got to keep in mind he wasn't married. He was a young senator. He used to get this senator from Florida named George Smathers and the two of them would go down to Havana and this was around 1955, 56 when the whole thing was in its heyday. And that was a big part of a van, uh, politicians and businessmen with going junkets to Havana, like, you know, paid for by the company, weekend retreat, go to Havana. And they'd go to the Shanghai theater and they have Tris, sexual Triste, and they'd go crazy. And it was out of sight, out of mind. It was the original, you know, what happens in Havana, stays

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       in van. It was all different country wasn't going to make the newspapers. So they go there and they'd rub elbows with Santa traffic content in Meyer Lansky and they loved it. It was exciting. It wouldn't. It wouldn't do them any damage back home.

Speaker 2:          02:13:45       No. It's amazing. When my mother died in [inaudible] 79 and whenever I did something like if I call my head differently or if I wore like a orange shirt, my mom will go, what are you fucking rock Hudson? And I go, what the fuck are you talking about rock Hudson, you know, one day I asked, why do you always call me a rock Hudson? And she goes, because rock Hudson, I don't money go. And I go, what the fuck are you talking about? She told me she died in [inaudible] 79. My Mom told me in 1978 flat out to my face that fucking he was gay as could be. And I'm like, you don't want. I've heard I'm sick and tired of you fucking Cubans because Cubans, like they used to tell me when I was a kid that they smacked Bruce Lee and Cuba one time that he went down there talking shit.

Speaker 2:          02:14:30       And one of my uncles smack them in the Cubans ally to you just to fucking fuck with you. So I thought my mother was fucking me. She's like a rock concert is as gay as a $3 bill. And I go, what the fuck are you talking about? She goes, I mean, what I'm talking about right when I was a little girl, Rock Katrina would come to Cuba and we would all go to the hotel. You like when Michael Jackson goes to a hotel, come outside and they clapped and he shook the kid outside the window. We would be out there like waiting to see rock coaching. But the hotel guy would tell us he was up there in a room with a man and I would go, Ma, are you fucking crazy? Like I didn't believe her. My mother died in [inaudible] 79 85 rockets and comes on. Says he's gay. Like Campbell was just a hiding place for people.

Speaker 5:          02:15:12       Did your mother know that the Marlon Brando was fucking Richard Pryor?

Speaker 2:          02:15:15       No. I found out from this article, if we will have scrolled down a little bit, it says it, that they asked his neighbors and the neighbors were like, no, he was bisexual and his number one guy that was known every time he came to Cuba was Marlon Brando. He was Marlon Brando was walking there with to showgirls and then him and fucking superman would leave by themselves.

Speaker 5:          02:15:39       Well, Brando loved the music he played, but he was really into it. Well, Pryor's wife was saying that back then, they were doing so much coke that everybody just fucked everybody. Everybody that's so crazy. He couldn't make Jack Fuck somebody like David Garrison. That was one of the Mick Jagger's wife said she caught David Bowie in bed with Mick Jagger. Know a lot of coke, but I never wanted to fuck you up the ass Joe Rogan. You know what I'm saying? Like I never did a lot of. Whenever I want to fuck another guy in the, in the story Brando who is bisexual took off with superman, ditching the dancers. So Superman was a bisexual too. In fact, I heard he had died of gangrene. Gangrene, yeah. And here it says infected. Yeah. He died with a lover from sex. Oh, he slept around but gangrene from sex. How hard you got to fuck to get gangrene.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       Maybe. Fuck this chick that got shot in the ass. He might've fucked animals. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dirty Bro. Cuba was dirty. It was dirty. Oh Gee. Let me say something else that's another, that whole society that he hasn't touched in on that I know he knows about. And that's the Aba Society. What's the requirement? That's a complete. That's the, that's the Brotherhood of men in Cuba. You will see. So as you see them at mcguire, you know you're dealing with them. Doesn't talk that day. The whole goal. They don't. What does that mean? Like I fuck with you. A couple of years ago you were living in Colorado and I saw a kid with a balloon and I call you balloons and we, me and Eddie, you come up to, I call him his nickname. You got a different situation. It'll pull you aside and go, I don't know you and don't you ever fucking call me that outside the circle again and when they get mad at you, okay to prove their manhood, they beat you.

Speaker 2:          02:17:36       Throw you on the floor, pull your pants down and slice your ass with a straight razor. That's the worst fucking mad one. Did that to two or three people. My mother's wake guy couldn't come in because one, it's sliced his ass. I'm like, oh no. This guy took me to baseball games. One, get the fuck out. He stand. That's their thing. They only pussy. They can't be in a room if another man is gay in the room. Wow. Oh yeah, but guess what? Your Romero. Tomi, it's sold dissolved. Now that this gay man and I bought 50 years ago, bro, Bro. Some people would call that advanced joey. That's progress. What's that? That now there's getting. Well, yeah, yeah. No, no. It's the surprise. They had gay man, but 50 years ago one of that went to her room. You had to be on your best behavior. They don't speak Spanish.

Speaker 2:          02:18:31       They have their own line. They have their own language. Oh, I know it. I know it. Wait a minute. They have their own language. That's the wrong way. Which in Spanish it's a. it's like a Patois. It's like a patois based on African Monina and I said it. It had some Spanish. When call you Monina. That's my brother and that thing. What's the Organization of this group? I mean is it is. It shows that a long shore man, that the man of Cuba, they don't even eat pussy. That's such a man, but they. And they can fuck other men and other men could suck. They're begging. They're big in prison systems. They got pregnant system. They can fuck other men. Oh yeah, I can. I can pick you out and go joe, you're no longer joe or Josephina will get a wig and put lipstick on.

Speaker 2:          02:20:57       No, no. This woman is second. A woman named will will dance. So you see the woman on the road?

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:21:10       I'll see how the guy shows up. That's an Aba. Look at this bucket. Beauty. The colors are white and red, right? You will see red. That's the guy that's the there. The take the tin man from the window. Was there the, you know, just saying that could get a break. They're going to salute with your elbow. Hit him back. Get a bad you. You, you could suffer like this. Making fun of making fun of it. Wow. If I see him like that's how I do like this, don't let me know. But you touch elbows. Touch, bow. Wow. And now there's actually gay men. Now it's diluted so much. It's been diluted over the years. But when I met Juan and Leo, they were two. Ob was a Taco tico or Latin band, not the cube. That the Conga player, the singer. He was about quarterly. So if you were, you just, there was a code way. You've very manly code. I come over here, there's a gay man and he I call you out of the room like, Oh, do me a favor. Get that motherfucker out of the room. Or if not, you can't talk to them. You can approach them a certain way. Cuba experienced a lot of progressive ideology. Like is it. If they changed it, it's very progressive

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       thoughts. What's caused this because they really didn't progress changing thing from. Yeah, but their progress. I mean they are so isolated. They didn't have the Internet, right? They don't have the Internet. No, no. I think certain places and they're getting it now. I think certain places. Yeah, he can get it here and there. It's not great. It's frustrating when you go there because he can't. What's what's Nice is you go to Havana and you kind of disengage from modern technology. I love it. I mean you couldn't live there because he can't really do business there, but you just kind of disengaged from. And is it easy to travel there now as far as flights in America? Just legal like a motherfucker like hilarious. I remember when I was a kid, like if you had a Cuban cigar, I was like a big deal. I don't tell anybody we got Cubans.

Speaker 5:          02:23:17       Well that's still, that's still illegal. Some of them, the embargo still exists. Yeah. But you could have some cigars. You're allowed to have some Cuban cigars. Right. You ever see if you, uh, what is the amount of. I think you're allowed to have like 10. You can't bring them back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't sell them here or if you can sell them here, you can't sell a lot. Something like that. Now I'm happy rose's book because a, I knew the story was out there. Joe. I like, we haven't even touched. Like I was raised by Omega seven guy. Like he grew up with my father. So I told Joey when I first met him and I was sort of almost done with this book. I said, I said, when you read it, you're going to need to sit down because for a guy like him, he knew a lot and I knew he would come across names that he knew, but there's no way you could have been part of this and known the whole thing right now.

Speaker 5:          02:24:14       Right. So you, you like, you knew who he was. You knew he was back. He didn't know it was a professional assassin for Omega seven. I knew todd that you killed. My mother warned me. My mother used to go, when he picks you up at school, please don't get in the car with them because it's going to get shot one day and I don't want to interrupt people. New Battle. And they knew some things about him, but they didn't know no one who was part of it. They thought they knew the whole story, but there's no way you couldn't. You couldn't know. It blew my fucking mind. I went to a dance with my daughter and I came home and the book was waiting for me. You know, Amazon drops it off in front of the house and they had ripped it and there was other kids, other moms with my wife and I don't like to do put it in my office. I want to open that. I saw Dorothy and Mancini and my fucking knee dropped like it had hit me. He kept texting me as you were reading at 12:00 at night and I go, you have no idea, but I didn't know that this guy used to go away every six months and his wife was tight. You know the story I told you about. My mom would play cards and then I would put tidy whities honors dance for the women of shots of Tequila and make me dance. Nina was in that

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       book. Nina is in that book. When my mother died, I gave Nina my dog. I couldn't take that dog, so I used to go to Nina's house on 51st street and cry in the dog house like this is my dog. So soon as I saw it, I knew he was onto something because dorothy was my father's friend and he was type of guy that would come visit me every week just because he was my father's friend and give me 50 bucks and take me to the city and get haircuts. But his claim to fame was in the seventh grade. My mother told him, I don't know what I'm going to do with them. He's got some fucking girlfriend. He won't even talk to me. This guy came to my house and gave me a capsule and right in front of me he filled it up with coke and he goes, let me tell you something.

Speaker 2:          02:26:05       Seventh grade, seventh grade, he goes, next time this girl comes over here, your sprinklers, coke on a pussy and you look at. And I'm like, I didn't even like a pussy that I had outside of genes. That coke capsule was in my drawer for like a year, like in the back of my nightstand, right? I didn't, you know, I wasn't at, it wasn't a drug, nothing. And One night my mom came home with three cocktails and then she's like, I got fucking news today from topic that he gave you cocaine. Where the fuck is I go to my drawer, I didn't use it. She fucking smack me. She goes, don't you ever fucking thing drugs? And then she went and did it. She went and did the blast. But that guy, when I was in the seventh grade, gave me a capsule of wow and said put it on her pussy or drive a fucking crazy. Like that's how that meant that he was

Speaker 1:          02:26:57       the text. I remember getting from you as you were reading the book. I was getting every, every, every 30 minutes or so I'd get a text from him and be another name like I can't believe you have this name. Finally the last one was the texts said Naynay Cordero with an exclamation mark and a comment and said, you bad motherfucker. He couldn't believe some of the names that were in there. And I know that he must have been emotional. I said, this is going to be tonight. I was crying because

Speaker 2:          02:27:23       that was two banks. When I was growing up, there was Raleigh, Amea Alito, and there were partners with child Miguelito. People used to goof on him. He had a pigeon toe and they would go on them in front of my mother and go, you know, he could be Coco's father, so mega lethal always duped me 100 bucks and they're writing them, but he had a Puerto Rican white, but his name was Martin Marlana. That was fucking hot and I guess the name mark has had an affair with her and he went in. The name mark has was the barber. Yeah. And when I was a kid I remember someone made a lethal shot and naked railroad and the foot. He walked right into the bar and that's joe it big and become the wild west. Yeah, like union city had become. If I shot Jamie, ain't no. The only person who didn't come after me as Joe. You know what I'm saying? Like there's no cops. Wow. There was no cops involved and it's like that today. Still. I don't know about. No, no, no, no, no. This was the seventies when still corruption. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:28:22       They robbed from fucking everything. They just went. I went home last week. There was problems with Doug Burgum right when I was home. I stayed in edgewater, so I didn't even go up there. When the book came out, I got a call from battles. Long time lawyer, a guy named Jack Blumenfeld. Wonderful Guy. Interviewed him numerous times for the book, new battle as well as anybody a defended him in a number of different cases over the years. I knew a lot about him. Uh, I sent the book to him. He called me. I don't know him that well, so he was a little stiff and first we corrected some factual things in the manuscript and then he got real quiet. He said, you know, this was very, it was very emotional for me to read this book. He said, cause just all kinds of things kept flooding back. You would use a name or you describe an incident and all of a sudden it would flood my memory.

Speaker 5:          02:29:14       Same thing that was happening to you when you read it, the little detail would go, oh my God, it was almost like an outer body experience and that's the power. That's the power of literature, man. That's the power of like losing yourself in a book to where it engages your memory and your imagination that you're almost reliving it as you're reading and you talk about 39 slash 11 Kennedy Boulevard, the home of Charlie's project, only basketball games. I went into those projects. I used to go there at seven in the morning and shoot 300 jump shots because there'd be nobody there. So imagine you're reading a book and you come across that address in. It reminds you of what he's saying. It was down the block, up the block, down the block was a bond named Bernice in north Bergen for years or you have to have.

Speaker 5:          02:29:59       You ran out of beer at five in the morning. You went to earnings and you're pounding on the door and they would go, what the fuck? You want? I want beer, or I write, what do you want me to get? Three, eight packs. I right, you should have said so what do you, when you getting emotional for you can be testing already would sell you business and there was the coldest beer in town. That was his reputation when we were in high school. Five in the morning early. Open up you fucking SPEC. Fuck you better open up and you better at least one full cases. Now I want to get the fuck. He would always say the two, but I grew up in those projects. Not a, I didn't live there. I don't know how many times I went there to play basketball with him and Ernie was probably a personal friend of the mayor's already.

Speaker 5:          02:30:42       Yeah. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? That's everything was connected. Joe and I both know Joe doesn't remember about who was running north Bergen at the time and like I said, when my, when my I became, I fell into that house. So where they, they got his kids. I got. They were really talents. So do you understand like if I went to your house, whatever the girls get I. Who does that anymore? They got a motorcycle. I got an Indian motorcycle if they went to Montauk for the weekend and I got the Montauk for the weekend. If they got a no show job, I got a little short job. I remember having a no show job in Irish man when I was like in the seventh grade. The Janet is hated me because that would, that would get that and have all the desk on top of Shit and they'd be buffing floors, not just walk past and will get my $80 check and they're like, are you ever going to do anything?

Speaker 5:          02:31:32       I'm gonna combine though. I do what I want. I knew you were connected. I knew I do not want to call my boss. I did whatever I wanted to. Wow. So listen, let's wrap this up. This book is out right now, the corporation, Tj English, and like I said, the Westies is a fucking great book. Once you get done with this book, go buy that book to Tj. Thank you very much. My place is great. I can't wait to read this. Thanks for having me. Is really fun. Podcast to an amazing, amazing stuff. All right, that's it.
