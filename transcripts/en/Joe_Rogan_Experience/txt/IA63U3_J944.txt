Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Doom, doom. Doom.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       MMM. Doda

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       amber live my man. I wish people who weren't watching on Youtube could just see the majesty. That is the jacket that robin black is wearing right now. How would you describe that? ADDS just a Jean Jacket, man. It's a colorful jean jacket. I like colorful stuff is definitely code, but it's not just colorful. It's like you're trying to blend in an array like could be, it does have some camouflaging affects you if you were a hunting in a rave, that's what you and where exactly. It's like, I don't know what you'd behind Posi yeah, ecstasy. It's like a light blue with like purple. Yeah. Some sort of decorations. Camouflage is a weird thing. And like what you see guys walking down the street with camouflage and it's like, it's what if they really were camouflaged? Like he'd just see a head floating down the street and one day they're going to have that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Have you ever seen that Japanese invention that came up with, they have this, um, like a cloak that you can wear and it essentially takes an image of what's behind you and projected on the front. So, visibility. Yeah, it was, it's, you know, it's kind of crude right now, but what it is is like the guy standing like you could see it right here. Look at this. That is ridiculous. And then nuts. That is wild. So this guys, so we're, we're looking at is a guy holding a ball and the ball does it. And so the ball somehow or another, he's holding it in front of his face and it doesn't show him when it's in front of them and shows what's behind him. I don't know how that one's working. I don't know. So here's the, this is the cloak. I've seen the cloak before, but you know, you can still see the cloak.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       Well, that's the thing with that kind of technology, once it starts, then you're on your way. Whether it's in one year or three years or 12 years, you're going to be invisible. Yeah. It's, we're in such a strange time because these emerging things are just starting to come out where, where people go, Ooh, oh, whoa. You know, like magic leap. If you've seen that magic leap technology, I just retweeted a new version of it today that somebody sent me. It's like, Oh God damn it. It just keeps getting so bad. It wasn't magic leap or was it the, um, the Microsoft one, which one's a man? One's a google one and one's a Microsoft Microsoft one. Which one that I tweet to them looking right now, but they've, um, Hololens, Hololens, Microsoft, that's Microsoft to is they've got these new goggles that you're going to be able to wear and it's going to be like minority report.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Like the world is going to be your desktop. It will spin things in the air, stop them, expand them, contract. I, you knew that was coming like as soon as you see it on a movie, you know that's going to happen to one thing. Right now it's like we are in probably the fastest time of change ever. You know what I mean? It's like if you have an idea, that idea can be done. It's just a series of steps to have to do it. Yeah. I mean, I think if you go back just a few, there's this it right here, Jamie. Just the picture. Just pictures of them using it. Like how crazy it's going to be a man. You're going to be able to like see movies play out in your living room right in front

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       of you. Video Games. Uh, you know, if you were doing a demonstration for like a company or something like that and you want to show them a project you're working on or maybe some architecture you're trying to do.

Speaker 4:          00:03:08       Construct. Yeah. Fucking crazy time. The first thing people are gonna start doing this. How do we connect this to sex? Oh yeah. Right away. That's where the money is. That's what the, somebody is thinking of that right now. People are going to be able to fuck right in your living room. Right. You're going to be a little, that's what the new porn is going to be. The thing is, I can fuck in my living room. Yes. All right. Do it yourself. I could do it yourself world. We need to get back to that. People get back to doing things. Actually not just watching them. Yeah, I that is, that is all weird thing. I mean, as much as you know, you make comedy and fighting and podcasts and stuff, it's still strange that people watch stuff all the time. Telling you find would love to be entertained. Yeah. You know, we like, we like to just have other people do the shit that sit back and watch. Yeah. But you would find that this is something I always kind of wonder about you, how you can possibly consume so many interesting and unrelated topics and develop expertise in so many unrelated things while being a content maker. Like you're making stuff that people consume. How can you possibly be mastering all these things at once?

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       I don't really have any. I'm not, I've mastered anything. You know, I'm, I'm pretty good at comedy. I throw some good kicks. I know Jujitsu pretty well. I'm not a master at any of those things.

Speaker 4:          00:04:28       Yeah. But I mean your ball hunting, you're, you know, there's so many different things. You know, like I literally do fighting stuff all day every day and when I get a break I hang out with my wife and sometimes I'll take a day off and that's it. I don't know about other stuff. It, it fascinates me how you can possibly know about so many things that seem unconnected.

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       I assume that it's probably some something wrong with my brain, you know, I assumed that this, it's like an extreme form of add, but I need a bunch of different things going on in my mind, in my life. I just, if I don't have a bunch of different things going on, I don't, I don't feel stimulated enough.

Speaker 4:          00:05:07       I, I'm almost the opposite. It's like I literally specialized so deeply in something once I know something about it, I need to know way more about it. And when I know stuff about that, that opens up a ton of new questions and that's why it's the same kind of area of stuff that I am obsessive Lee researching and studying. I do that too, but I just do it with a bunch of different things. That's what I mean. That's what I'm getting at.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       I listened to a archery podcasts where they're just talking about very specific ways to hold a bow and and, and fix your site and make sure you use it at least properly. I'll listen those fucking things for hours and hours and hours, obsessive Lee and top of practicing. I just get obsessed with things but I used to worry about it when I was younger. I used to be like, what the fuck is wrong with me? I can't just concentrate on one thing. I always have all these other shit going on in my life. But then realized like, well that's just

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       me. If I just enjoy it and just do those things then then it doesn't concern me then I'm just appreciative that I have so many interests. Did you ever read? Uh, at some piece somebody wrote something about, uh, oh, I hate Joe Rogan, or why I hate Joe Rogan. And then he went on this path and he discovered that he actually hated that you wear your authentic self. Have you ever read this? Somebody wrote this thing and he, as he learned more about what it was to be authentically him, he realized his hatred for some famous person was that he was looking at him and he hated that that guy was actually him. Obviously it's easy to hate somebody that's like in the microscope all the time because you'll find all these flaws, like if you follow someone every day, day in, day out and expect perfection or enlightenment, you're going to be massively disappointed because the kind of exposure that you get when you're doing a podcast, like when you're talking to someone for hours and hours and hours.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       You know, I've done 700 and what is it, seven, so 760 to 762 podcasts. The shortest one is an hour. Most of them are three hours. It's 2,100 almost 2,500 hours, somewhere around that, you know, give or take. That's what it's. Um, there's know so you're going to, you're going to get annoyed at me. I get annoyed at me. Hey, but his point wasn't that it was that you are authentically Joe Rogan, like whatever it is you do, you ended up being, I mean you're sitting here in a place that you built to do the thing that you want to do. Exactly the way you want to do it. You're as authentically a human being as a person can be. Or just so you know what you're talking about, accepting why you go and do things the way that you do them. That's why you do cause you're like fuck being some other thing.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       I'm going to be this thing. Well that's just, I think having this kind of a life is super lucky and if I didn't live it that way, I wouldn't be taken advantage of this huge opportunity that very few people get. Most people have to work. Do they have an actual fucking job that they don't really necessarily like that much? And somehow or another I've figured out a way. I mean I worked when I was younger for sure and I figured out how to get to this spot by sort of moving away from things that I didn't want to do. But now that I get to a point where everything I do, whether it's his, but I was looking forward to this, I'm like, I'm going to get the, hang on my friend rob. You can have some fun talk, some MMA and life and all kinds of shit and that's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       I feel like what I go do stand up. Same thing. I feel like when I'm practicing archery or I'm working out this, those, these are things I enjoy doing. So that's why I do what I do and I really believe people can do that. I think it just have to start first of all, by figuring out what it is you want to do. Because if you don't know that, then you're just going to start wandering. But the thing is to be pushed. Somebody, they all know. Most people really know what it is that they love. I find the young people lot of times don't like a lot of young young folks when to talk to them. They just don't have a path like, God, I just need to find something to do. I'm thinking about doing this, or maybe I'll, I'll join the military to get some guidance and some

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       discipline or maybe I'll do that. Or they just, it's, it's hard to tell because like, what's cool for you, you know, Jamie might not like with Jenny might like, I might not, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       Jamie was trying to find a Kanye west shoes. I'll ask her. This jacket is mother. Motherfucker was up all night trying to get Kanye West. You know, it's true for everybody. Everybody's different. You know? I think you got to figure out what it is you like doing because the path of going to do that is the whole point is that people often be like, well, I want to get this kind of job or I want to buy this kind of house and it's not, it's not supposed to be that way, in my opinion. You're supposed to start on a path and on that path, traveling along it, you're having adventures, you're stumbling onto new things, and the challenge of it being really hard to achieve is part of what gets you up every day. Yeah, and it's also fun. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       Watching things, improve, watching yourself get better at things and analyzing things and figuring out what the whole, the holes are, the flaws where the, where the errors are and your little system that you've created. Those, those, those moments are fucking awesome. They're really fun. Yeah. It's just, you don't want really frustrates me, really frustrates me when talking about these things. Sometimes I'll get messages from people and they'll say, well, that's easy for you to, because you know you've got lucky and you found it, but like, you know, a lot of people can't do that. A lot of people have responded in, they'll, they'll come up with all these reasons why they can't. Instead of saying, well, my situation is particularly difficult, but there's a work around and I'm going to find it. Yeah. It might take me a year. It might take me a decade. I'm going to find it. If

Speaker 4:          00:10:32       wherever it is you're ending up is somewhere in the future, you don't know what that is and now it's like, well, I would like to do that thing I got to do, but I have all these responsibilities. Okay. Our new job to figure out how to take care of those responsibilities. That's step one. Do you know what that maslow's hierarchy of needs? Yes. Yeah. That idea that first we have to like eat. You gotta eat, you gotta stay dry and you got to drink water and once we've kind of accomplished that kind of stuff that's out of the way, then we start to go a little further. How do we become safer? Once that happens, you climb up to the point that you're actually eating, sleeping, having sex. You have a place to live, you have a job, and now you're trying to learn more things and it's just a natural kind of transition to get smarter and move.

Speaker 4:          00:11:15       But it's easy to say that. The hard part I think is starting going now. Yeah. You know the hard part is going, okay, this isn't working well. What if I got some exercise like maybe that would help like something. For some people that path isn't what job do I got to start tomorrow? That path is like, well, I'm unhealthy are I don't think, my thought processes aren't things that lead me this way, so you've got to start way low on that thing and start getting that shit together. Eat good, get sleep and exercise. That shit. Everybody should have to do those things like in our society should be shaped in a way that you have to do those things because if you aren't doing those things right there, you're starting from a place where we're just not performing as well as you could. It's so hard to tell people that though.

Speaker 4:          00:11:58       They don't want to hear it. They just love that food porn. He just love just shoving doughnuts in their face. Yeah, pasta and just fucking sugar shame, but there's a lot of things that are terrible for you that are great heroines. I've only been in woodland hills three times. This is the second time we've been on your shelf. The other time was the time I was on heroin for four days. That's the only other time I was in four days or four days in woodland hills. I was 20 years old to him. Yeah. It was weird shooting up. Yeah. Yeah. It was very strange. Telecom. That's a commitment. Yeah. It didn't start that way. Like lit, like all things Mo, nobody grows up and says, I'm going to do really stupid things. I was like 20 and I lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and uh, I was really into music and I came down here for, I was a hairdresser at the time.

Speaker 4:          00:12:52       And so, uh, uh, and this jacket would work perfectly. So your hair. Yeah, exactly. So, and I was down here doing some, like I would go do platform work where I would like demonstrate how to do stuff for other hairdressers and people. And uh, I went to, uh, uh, not the viper room, uh, one of those clubs. And this pretty woman comes up to me and says, uh, are you a musician? And I'm like, yeah, but, and I'm kind of about to say, but I live in Canada. And that you know, and she goes, well, my husband's putting together a band and a, you got to meet him. His name's Andy Mccoy and Eddie Mccoy wouldn't mean much to a lot of people, but to somebody who was really into like motley crue and stuff like that, he was in a band called Hanoi rocks that was kind of started that movement.

Speaker 4:          00:13:36       I'm like, Whoa Shit, I'm going to be famous. Like I'm going to be rich and famous. Not knowing that, although metal edge told me that this guy was a big deal, he was just to get a musician, but I had to a 20 year old from Winnipeg, so call my God, I'm going to be in a huge fucking band. So I go and I meet him, we go to his house in Woodland Hills and I actually, I've been here four times. There was that time that I flew home to Winnipeg and they flew me back down because they were going to get me singing in their band. I'm like 20 years old. This guy is like famous to me, right? So I get down there and that shit is done. All that organized, you know what I mean? Like something's not making a lot of sense. And then around day two I figured out, okay, because everyone's on heroin.

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       And it started, we had smoked some pot, which in Winnipeg, in Manitoba we called that dope, you want to smoke some dope? It's like, sure. It was like, so he goes, do you do dope? I'm like, yeah, I just smoked it with you like 20 minutes ago because no like, and then before I knew it, he injected me with heroin. Like a sorta happened. I was trying to be a, not super uncool, but like not saying yes, I want to do heroin. And then four days went by like literally just shooting up for days. And then I just about miss my plane home. So I had a girl and a and a home and a job and all those kinds of things. And I'm kind of at like the plane ticket and I know it's like, okay, if I get a cab in the next two hours, I'll get the plane, I'll get home and whatever.

Speaker 4:          00:14:58       And he's like, well, just, you know, and you're not even thinking. It's like you're barely even there. And somewhere along the line I was just like, don't worry about it. Just fine. You don't have to go get on the plane. I probably got $100 to my name and if I didn't get on that play and I'd have no job, no girl, I'd be a heroin addict with no money in woodland hills with a guy who's doesn't have his shit together. I think in the years since he's got his shit together, I haven't seen him since then. And uh, I've made myself go and I was sick for two or three days and I realized like literally that second in time, if I don't convince myself to get on that plane, my whole life is fucking ruined. Whoa. Yeah. Like I just so vividly remember talking, my, trying to talk myself into just fuck it, stay here.

Speaker 4:          00:15:44       Don't worry about it. And then I would think to myself, well, what are you going to do? When are you going to get home? Don't fucking worry about a man. And I just forced my, and I would literally convincing myself, don't bother, don't worry. It's not a big deal. But it was obviously a big deal. And I got home, I was sick for two days and I've never taken an opiate or any kind of pain killer ever again. So you were sick, like hung over violent form of it withdrawals. Probably like you'd have to talk to, you know, I, in the course of playing in music, I've met lots of people who have opiate problems and they would say, aw man, four days, that's nothing. But to a person who, you know, to a person who was a normal person and then we'll all of a sudden they were doing drugs for four days.

Speaker 4:          00:16:29       It probably was. Yeah, violent withdrawal. So it was very sick and I knew that day it's like I'm just never going to take any kind of narcotic or painkiller like that ever again. Wow. So that was second, last time I was in woodland hills. Well, the, I deal that you could just become that person like that. You just the wrong person. You want to do some dope, Yo, we just did dope dying. All of a sudden you're on heroin. Yeah. And there's lots of those little moments in everybody's life, you know, and you don't, yeah, that's a big one. But you don't know where they are or where they are or how they start the, you're just suddenly, you know what I mean? Manny lasts as we get all there, we start to get a little smarter. You recognize big risks earlier on down the road as you get all of their life experience helps you with that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:17:20       But yeah, that's, I was thinking that on the way here today. I was like, Oh yeah. But I mean, that's 25, 26 years ago. So did you ever talk to that guy again? Uh, we were in touch about maybe still putting this band together and then he was clearly, you know, had addiction issues. I followed him a little bit after he, um, he, uh, had a reality show. He's from Finland and he's a pretty big rockstar in Finland. And he and his wife who was there at the time, that was a woman that I met, they had a reality show with, you know, kind

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       of like, um, what ozzy did but with them and uh, yeah. So crazy. Yeah. Finland. Yeah. How many people are in Finland? Probably about half as many as Canada. That would be my guest. Which about 30 million. Some 15 or 20 million maybe. And this big rock star? We think so. I mean, I, it's, the whole music world is such a different life to me now. Like I've been so deeply embedded in a fighting for the last decade. Like I don't know about much alice. Like he, he could be the precedent of Finland to right now for all I know, like I just don't consume a lot of other things. It's shocking to me. I have a lot of friends now that are musicians that are doing really well and not making much money. Yeah, it's fucking, it's eerie. It's eerie when you find out that these guys who you think would be ballers or like kind of struggling, you had that, that business is crazy dad.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       But the touring is what I don't understand. It's like how come they're not making all this money from touring? But I guess it's like a comic has a much lower overhead comics. Just we don't need anything. Just turn the microphone on and we're good. We need support. They have all these other people that are there. You know, they have people that carry their stuff. Roadies sound people live lights. Yeah. They have other people in the band obviously. So, um, when, when we went and saw you at cod that that was awesome. Through by the way. Well that was fun. Called Theater of the gym. Doing that again next month. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so at something like that. Do you have anybody else like us? Our sound guy? Is it the house guy? Like do you have a house car? They just have to turn the mic off.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       That's amazing. Well, it's just so low maintenance being a comedian, you just have to, you know, sell tickets. And you get there and you say hi and you can just go do your act except for the 30 years developing, you're building it and having, you know, the insight to understanding how people laugh and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. We, you of developing your ability to make an act, but the act itself is like, he lives for about two years dies. Then you have to like let it go. Like you, you, you build it up, you put it on something, put it on some sort of a special or a cd or something like that. And then you got to abandon it and wow. And then you move on to the next two hours. And in those two years, I'm going to pull this back to fighting because everything gets pulled back.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       I've been trying to just scope, you don't have to talk about fighting all the time. I've been telling myself that outside of work regularly, actively trying to find other things to, to know about or learn about. But uh, uh, you build like structures around something, right? So Johnny Hendricks, he goes to fight Stephen Thompson, his whole world has been built like that act for years. He's built that thing and structures were built around how to perform that act that way. And then all of a sudden it's just dated. It's just not going to work in this setting, you know? Yeah. It's a two completely dated when you're dealing with this, there's two things at wonderboy didn't that fight, um, that you're, you just didn't see up until he came around and uh, one big one was the front leg attacks, his front leg side kick in front leg roundhouse kick to the face and you see he hit johnny with the front leg side kick to the body.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       You can see it really shook johnny. And then immediately afterwards he goes high and hits him with the front leg roundhouse kick right in the chin. And he's like, what in the fuck? Like this guy can do some shit with his feet that I'm just not geared up for. I'm not, it isn't that he didn't have the timing for, it's Johnny was in a gym boxing with boxers. Lots and lots of boxes because his hands are great. He's got to get some moving around. As long as guys stand in front of them. And it's like that literally what Stephen Thompson dead and what your step really exciting thing is seeing right now is this weird moment where it's like you're a great wrestler. So what am I need to, I've got to go Linda Russell. You don't have to fucking learn to wrestle. We're going to do that anyways.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       We got to learn to make it not about wrestling. We've got to make it so, I mean mma developed by finding the answer to the thing and somewhere all of us, every coach, every one of us, uh, five years ago, seven years ago, we were like, well that's it. It's boxing, wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, this cage work. This is how fighting is done. That's it. And we're fucking way wrong. So when that, when we think that we start building a structured gym environment curriculums, how we train and that thing gets more ingrained and complicated and you go to the gym, you work these four or five things and some guy over here is working on other stuff and a whole gym is like that. And the, all our training partners are like that and we're working the mixed martial arts curriculum, but some other guy isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       And when he develops that thing, we're not prepared for it. We're just not prepared for sport karate. That's poor karate blitz. That's something that Thompson can do. But also he came from a kickboxing background. So he's got the sport karate ability to leap in sorta like Raymond Daniels or fights and glory. He's got that leap in attack ability. That's very difficult to deal with if you don't have that kind of footwork. And then on top of that, he can string together beautiful hand combinations. So he'll, he'll slide in, blitz you with four or five beautiful hand combinations and then slide away and then kick you in the stomach as he sliding away. And you're like, Jesus Christ, you can see the bewildered look on Johnny's face in that fight. Yeah. And he's a brilliant fighter. He was the champ. He was a tough guy. But Johnny's got that style where he'll stay like johnny and Robbie, he goes, stood in front of each other and you're just not going to find that with wonderboy.

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       No, he's just not there. And that's what this guy's trying to you. That's the game. He's going to try this guy, he's holding up a plastic cell. Is it plastic sell plastics? Like they sent us a conor mcgregor doll. It's a look that is all stumpy and like angry. The same guys who sent the Biggie doll that sent us a conor mcgregor and James got a Tupac over there. There's a Bruce Lee for Joey Diaz. But uh, but yeah, but, but, but what he can do with his feet is not nearly at the level that Stephen Thompson is. Stephen Thompson's doing some shit with his feet, the way he's throwing kicks, they're deadly. I mean he, he's, he's one of the best kick boxers that Americans really ever produced. That's amazing. 57 and o as a kickboxer and that, and so then you go and train with Weidman, right?

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       And, and, and Weidman roughs you up and Rodman's Weidman's work ethic and, and the whole thing rubs off on you and you just start getting familiar with it. And it is, yeah, I can defend take downs, but more importantly, we ain't fucking wrestling. We're not going to wrestle. And it seems him, Cruz, Cruz, if fucking absolute genius. All these guys, even Demetrius and, and Matt Hume, they play this game. So we're sitting here and like, can we, we can't wrestle from here. Right? So for you to get to me, you have to travel through space as you move forward. Two feet. I moved back to feet. You moved that way, two feet and he played this game where we keep the space forever and I just keep that space as long as you want me, I'm making that space. And when the space is there, either you're going to get so lulled into it that I can, uh, Dardin and wonderboy as weapons, ours kicks.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       But some guys will do with their hands at Darden and hit you or you start chasing me. You Chase van intercept two and fuck you up. And it's just so logical and you're looking at it now and just the way that the karate guys had to go learn to wrestle or did they, they had to learn to not wrestle to make it not about wrestling as much as possible. The Johnny Hendricks, the Matt Hughes style of fighter, they got to figure this out. You have to figure it out. Well you know, what happened was he learned how to get comfortable standing up where he didn't worry about being taken down all the time. And then you get to see what he's really capable of with his striking, cause you look at his earlier fights, he was a little more tight because he was worried about being taken down.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       So all that takedown defense, I mean he always had the great footwork, but now he also has a solution. If you do grab him. So when guys grab him, he's not out of water, he knows what to do, he can break free again and it is way harder to take someone down when they're not trying to rustle with you. If someone's trying to be aggressive and attack, you can counter and you can take advantage of, of, of, of openings that they leave. But when someone is just being defensive, like if Jujitsu, if you roll with someone, it's very hard to tap someone who's just being defensive. They're not trying to attack is when they open up and they go after you. That's where you can get them. That's when they leave openings. And this is saying, I think the same thing with wrestling. These guys like Mirko Cro cop was a great example when he first started fighting in pride, he took, you know, just like a year or so and all of a sudden he had takedown defense figured out and everybody was fucked because then you've got to stand with this guy. And he was one of the best examples of a high level kickboxer that entered into mma because he was always a one shot explosive

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       striker. Whereas a guy like Ernesto hoost was a combination fighter. A guy who through beautiful technically perfect combinations but never really like Alec blitzed in and exploded. And it seems like the blitz is a big part of MMA fighting. Yeah, it's not, I mean the tactical striking for sure is important, but I think you've gotta be able to make that mark quickly. Especially with those little gloves.

Speaker 4:          00:27:10       Yeah, and the f the footwork, if it gets me over, gets you over here that I have to take one step just center back into you. Then you blitz me there. That's when Dominic's doing for the last number of years and then he start now get so good at that thing. You can't quite figure out how to, even like the Anthony Johnson is so good at staying in balance to hit you wherever you are. He's in balance to hit you because Henry hoofed looked at him and was like, what's the key to this guy? Just put them in a place where he can always hit. Yeah. Like put them in a place where you can deliver with power. He's really good at that. Small little steps, you know? And uh, but dominick Cruz could dance all around them. Dominick Cruz can move it so that he has to step back to him.

Speaker 4:          00:27:52       That's when he'll get in. Then you get so good at that one thing and he just starts camouflaging with other things. Now you don't know when it's coming now maybe you hesitate. Oh, when you hesitate, he has an an option. When you chase, he has more options. You think it's better to stay, to stay still. So you do. Then you get beat up. So then you think, I better get after him. And then when you do, you get intercepted. And that whole thing must become so frustrating, you know, so mentally frustrating. Then you're like, I got to take this guy down. And in some cases that's what they're waiting for, you know, hit you on the way in. Just that game is so it, it's, it feels like the big difference. Now, if you can't do that, if I can't do that and you can, yeah, what the fuck am I going to do? Well, I have to fight.

Speaker 3:          00:28:34       That was Ali and his is. Yes. You know when Ali was young before they took away his title and he was kicked out of boxing for three years and then he came back and he's much more flat footed, but the early days when you would watch Ali fight guys, he would be able to move away from them and then slide back in and hit them and they really didn't have a solution to that. And when you don't have a solution to that, that means you're getting hit and you're not being able to hit the other guy.

Speaker 4:          00:28:58       And the just think of that, you know, you can be ready yourself for that. You're prepared, you know it's a challenge. But you've been working on answer. It's like I thought for sure Duane Ludwig with Tj, they would have worked on like situational things and maybe they did. It's like when he's here, we're either going to option a or b. We know these are some of his choices. Big, broad strokes, answers and it worked sometimes. I mean we look back in that fight. I thought Dominic won, but Tj had the moments where he had the biggest shots or the cleanest shots. There was only half a dozen of them in 25 minutes, but at you saw that was the answer, but it must be incredibly frustrating to be in there. You're mentally prepared for it. You got the answers and as the minutes are clicking away you're like, oh shit.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       It's true. Someone lied to me. That feeling, that must be the worst. When you know you're like, oh shit, they lied to me. What do you mean by that? There was a Mensa Johnson, so Phil Davis is like a, I'm a huge fan of felt him, so I love filterings. Yeah, he was fighting Anthony Johnson and he went for that first take down and you go back and you look the look on his face when he fails that take down. It's like this is not what I was told it was going to be. Maybe somebody lied to me. Sounds like a funny way to say it, but this is not how it was supposed to go. Right. This is not holy fuck Anthony Johnson. Someone said he I was going to be able to take them down. I can't, and that look on his face like that changes everything.

Speaker 4:          00:30:22       The whole fight now from this moment that this big dude stop my takedown, shook it off and kind of looked at me now the whole fight is nothing like I had laid it out. Yeah. I think, um, if dominic, I think when you wants to Tj fight, like the big moments that Tj had, I think what Dwayne was twice trying to get him to do more was not load up and that he was really trying to knock dominic out. I mean that's really what he wanted to do. I think maybe if we just concentrated more on the leg kicks, I mean he had that one leg where it turned out the dominic had had like a serious injury with his foot, like plantar fasciitis and it turned out that you have you, what does it like? Oh God. So I actually had it after a fight.

Speaker 4:          00:31:06       My last fight was my best performance ever and uh, and it went great and that fight training, going up to it, the guy was a very good striker compared to me and uh, he thought I was going to take him down, that he assumed, we knew that he knew that was what I was going to do. Only that wasn't what I was going to do. I, it's going to put them up against the cage and hauled them there and beat him up there until he got tired and I could find a way. But we were not planning to take them down. We were planning to put him against the cage, but all that leverage, like all that driving off the foot against the cage, it, it hurt my foot. And then we went, my wife and I went on vacation right after and we walked nonstop the first day that we were there, just nonstop.

Speaker 4:          00:31:47       And the next day the fasciitis happened and it feels literally like, like you can't even put weight on your foot like kids so inflamed and you don't know what it is like did you damage it is a just hurt and it hurt for months and months and months and months after and just yoga actually helped it real. Yeah. Strengthening of foot and ankle. Yeah. Yoga is one of the things that um, one of the things that I've found I want to sort of getting in how much my feet hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Because my feet are weaker. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're, you're big and your feet and ankles are designed to do the stuff that you do to them and now you're asking them to do all this other stuff. I was surprised because I felt like, well I do so much barefoot or lift weights barefoot. I kicked the bag, everything's barefoot. I was like, this is not going to be hard to just stand on my feet and hold poses. But it was pretty hard for like the first couple months I would have like some serious foot pain, certain positions. And then now they're stronger.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Yeah. Now it's much better. But still, that's probably my weakest part is uh, my balancing, balancing my foot there as SA. When you had Carlos and his movement guy on him and that was one of the things they talked about. It's one of the things that you don't portel talks about too is that the, one of the biggest weaknesses and our whole chain for most of us is our feet and her ankles. That's nick curse on his number one thing. I said, what's the number one thing that you like to work on with fighters is like foot strength flats. The number one thing that guys have that they need to, they need to improve with mine just fully inflamed for a long time after that fight and just mistreatment and they were already so what do you do for that? I literally, I was in Mexico and I would have to like sit against, lean on my wife to get to the bar, to drink some Tequila so that it would hurt a little less so I could get to the pool where it didn't hurt as much.

Speaker 1:          00:33:29       Because you had water boiling you, so will you like taking painkillers are anti inflammatory pain killer since the last time? No, opiates and advil. Advil. I literally couldn't walk for three days. I'm not joking. I would lean on her to get to the bar to have some Tequila so that it is the, the Fascia of the bar on the bottom of the foot that separates is that separates or inflames and we got it. The plantar Fascia. Yeah. And I guess it affects people in different ways. Like if it's, if it's over, you know, if it shortens, it gets hard and it shortens. That hurts your foot in other ways. It's just a weird kind of spot. We're walking on that all day. All the time. Climbing and fighting and running and whatever things we do. And that thing right there is on the bottom. I mean, you gotta figure that's going to take some abuse in your life.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       They also say a big issue is shoes. The way, the padding that we have on shoes, the extra like the runner's padding in there, you're really supposed to have like the most minimal amount of protection from the environment as possible. Just a thin minimalist type of a shoe that and that allows us to use our feet. The thing we got is just a big lump on it, you know, so you don't get to use it. Uh, but when, when you train in taekwondo growing up like martial arts for kids like kids and teenagers and stuff, man, it's just kind of make everything better, you know? Definitely flexibility. Yeah. I still really flexible at 48. I mean it's, cause I'd never stopped doing it, but it's also because I started doing it before my body grew up. Right. Yeah. You know, but the, the, what they're saying now is that like navy seals that are learning going through training and everything with those toe shoes.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       Yeah. They're trying to stop them from wearing those toe shoes because so many guys that are feet are not strong enough to run and do all these exercises in those things because they're used to wearing like you basic running shoe with a thick heel. Have you ever, um, people are listening to this? Uh, I think there's a Ted talk about it where they went over how someone had created one of those running shoes with the thick heel area and what did it done is really essentially change the way people run. It changed their gate and it made people run. He'll first, which is totally unnatural. You're supposed to

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       run like ball of the foot first and your foot's supposed to absorb the energy. And when you do that, you know your foot access sort of like a spring and it slows you down at decelerates you and that's how you're supposed to run. You push off that and you run with that. If you do that, your, your foot will be very strong and you could run long distances and your foot will stay healthy. But if you're used to using those running shoes with the big heel, you go heel down first. You don't have that strength in your foot and you can get really fucking injured. If you try to do the same amount of miles and the same intense workout would like a toe shoe or something like that because your feet are just not designed for it yet. Or you know, conditioned for it. Rather.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       The funny thing like when you know, they're telling them not to use these shoes because they're feet aren't strong enough, but if they use the shoes, their feet will become strong enough, you know, but they want them to go through some pretty fucking ruling, rigorous soul searching, you know, workouts. Um, and uh, we had talked about I was hurt, I did yoga. It fixed it. You did yoga. It hurt. Now it's better. Like you'll have to go through a certain amount of heart. You have to go through a certain amount of, you know, challenge to repair it, you know? But it's, it strikes me so strange when you think about some things that we, that humans do, something as small or big as gone, well, we're going to wear these shoes, changes everything. Not only how we are our future, the way, like these little things that we do as, as people.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       You don't, you never, you're never able to project the good and the bad outcomes of them in the future. You just have to deal with them when they happen. Yeah. I'm, I'm a big fan. Um, when it comes to like minimalist footwear, I'm a big fan of wearing like real, I workout with the either barefoot or these. I have these new balances lists like a slipper. Yeah. I have the exact same black, but they're like this little thin thing while we're the toe shoes. But goddamn people give you a hard time. Yeah, me too. Brutal. I have those new balance once. I do still do a lot of power lifting. I love power lifting. I just love it. Yeah. I tried to do yoga and martial arts and an offset, but I love heavy lifting and deadlifts. You can't use padding. You'll, you're gonna lose force and we have to use some time usually or I'll use the new balance ones, but I'm not Nike's rather converse all star like these things, the chucks

Speaker 3:          00:37:50       favorite cause they're just flat, they're flat and there's a very thin and you can kind of feed the, they're real flexible, you know, like, like you will you, if you climb something with these things, they like bend and give. It's not like a rigid thing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       No. Uh, have you ever done a power lifting meet? Yeah. It's Super Fun, man. You do it. You go and he, yeah, you go and compete. Compete in the hour. That wasn't my, I won the nationals at my age and weight. Holy Shit. I traded this place. How much do you, what do you lift and how much you want. Then I would weigh about one 55 and I'll deadlift maybe like three 63 zero a lot of weight. And then my benches maybe two 30, two 40, which doesn't sound like a lot of weight to people who go to the gym and just throw it around. But, uh, a one 55, that's a of weight, but a power lifting. Um, like at a regulation, a bench press, you bring it down, it's got to stop all movement and you wait for the command to push. So it's, it's how long do you wait until all moving to stop?

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       Might be one. Second. Could be two. Could be three. They say press. So you can't bounce it on no bounds. Stop all movement and press from that spot. But I trained at this place. I love it. I just, I love it. Um, and uh, in Toronto, my wife comes now too. And uh, I brought her at first because she always wanted me to cancel because it was caught in the morning. She's like, why don't we just go get for breakfast? There's, well, why do you have to go to the gym tomorrow? So then I just started. Yeah, yeah. Well not, she's cool man. I like she temptresses temptress she is super cool, but I was just like, she's, you know, she's always like, oh, just skip one. So I started with, got her going. Now she loves it too. But tons of women power lift now and yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:28       Yeah. And it's, it shouldn't be the only thing that you do because weightlifting, you, you mentioned you lifted weights all your life and all of a sudden you did yoga and it added so much. But if you're lifting weights and doing movement and doing yoga and doing flexibility stuffs, but that's hard to do. That goes right back to what we said. You've got to work out, you got to eat, go to and you got to sleep or else you won't have a good life. Well, how does it, how most people don't have the time to do all the different things you would need to do? So one of the most frustrating things about people that get into Jujitsu is they just do Jujitsu. And I'm always like, man, you really should lift some weights. Especially if you're getting older. Like it's one of the most important things to preserve the joints, like keeping muscle tissue strong and healthy, and making sure that you've got good muscle density that protect those joints because you know you're engaging in a form of combat on a regular basis and you're doing no strengthening other than that combat.

Speaker 1:          00:40:20       So we are people, when you go to the gym, you see them white tie guys and they're standing around and move in and stuff. That Jujitsu guys are sitting around chatting, right? So that mood makes you feel like it's not combat. And then you do Jujitsu and it's fucking fighting and you know, as it's physically fighting, your joints are fighting. And I think the mood of it makes it feel like, ah, you know, so it's a bit of a stoner sport in some ways. Guys just chill out and they're wearing the pajamas hanging out. But it's fighting, you know, if you're getting caught and things, you know, just trying to fight out of them or trying to not tap, you put tremendous amount of pressure on your joints. Tremendous amount of pressure on your neck, on your back. The Lowe's, a lot of pressure on your back to try to get out of situations.

Speaker 1:          00:41:03       You're contorting yourself often, you know, and you really need to be strong in those areas. And flexible, flexible is a big one. It's very important. I took a first time I met Eddy, I took his seminar and Eddie's got a room full of people and I think he maybe had hard him say this before in a video or something. And if people are stretching and he says, well you gotta you gotta work on that. And somebody said, well this is as flexible as I am. And he's like, that is a very north American line of thinking. And no other place where people go, this is as flexible as I am. They'd say this is as flexible as I am right now. If I work at it, I will become more flexible, like everything in life. But for some reason we have these limiting beliefs. You know, it's like if, do you know how to play piano?

Speaker 1:          00:41:46       No, no. But you could learn how to play piano if it was important to you and then the fingers work. Yeah. And in six weeks you'd be a better piano player than you are today. And in three years you'd be away. Better Piano player. That's true of every single thing in life. And, and one of the reasons I learned stuff from, from studying fighters, like I learned stuff about life, lots of stuff, but one of those big ones is that growth mindset. The idea that if we put in time on anything, it'll get better. And the work itself is the point that thing for some, if, if a kid has that, their whole life is better, if any. And we can have it at 40 or 50 or 60. The idea that whatever I am is not what I am. It's what I am today, but I can improve those things.

Speaker 1:          00:42:28       I love that. That's a great attitude. That's a great way to say it. Whenever I am is what I am today. Yeah. It's like, I mean, people, I talk about this guy, I like this little thing. This thing's pretty cool. Uh, I talked about that guy a lot and people, we were talking about people hating sometime people that they see on tv. Some people hate this guy, Garcia. He talks a lot of shit. Yeah, for sure. Exactly. Exactly. You put it perfectly. Um, but the thing that guy has is that insane growth mindset think it's to him anything is possible. I believe anything is possible. But if you win a 155 belt, okay, you go fight for fight Robbie. Okay. If you one that, what are you going to fight? Rockhold and then you know, John John's, there are limits. You know what I mean? There are fucking limits, but he actually believes there are none in that belief.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       He's better at everything than he was yesterday and he's still rockhold kick some butt. You realize that's what I, that's what I'm saying. There's gotta be a point. But that belief that there is no point, that belief that there is no limit whatsoever is incredibly powerful when it's put together with a drive of a work ethic, with an insane work ethic. That is a powerful thing. Well, it's interesting too because with fighters, when they're in camp, most of the time you're preparing for a specific opponent. You're not really picking up new skills. The way they really pick up skills is by training and taking chances and going outside the comfort zone, which is really not something you want to do while you're conditioning yourself for a fight. So when a lot of times when guys are going back to back to back and they're fighting along, then I'm really improving. Much they're doing is just, they're improving their ability to compete because they're getting more comfortable because they're competing a lot. They're getting relaxed, they're in great shape and uh, they're getting used to the feeling of being in competition. But man, there's, there's not a lot of time to take some time to just go over new stuff, to learn new things, to add new weapons. Well, when I talked to

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       him and his coach, Kevin now, who I only spoke to you briefly, actually, I tried to contact him to ask him if I could pick his mind a bit before doing this breakdown. I took it as a big compliment that he's like, Nah, uh, of maybe chat with you after like that. If he gave me something I might pass it on. I took it as a compliment. Um, and I do a podcast, uh, the mentality of combat sports and I do it with my very good friend David Mullins. Is it on itunes? No, it is or will be. We're not super on top of that. How long have you been doing? We've been doing it for a year with a fuck, you know, it's on, it's on youtube. It's on youtube. Yeah. But well it either has been on itunes for a few months or it's in the process.

Speaker 4:          00:45:11       We got a guy who does that. Um, uh, but, uh, so, and I've been doing with him and he is part of the SPG team. He's the these straight blast gym. Yeah, the combat this sports psychology coach of the team. Oh. And when I asked him about Khan and we're very good friends, um, but when I ask him about connor, he says, conor is his own coach. But I know at the same time when you work with the coach, his, his own mental coach, he's on his own journey and not that he doesn't want information from David, but he wants it from 50 sources. He's consuming, consuming like a philosophy and ideas of how to improve and ideas of what it is to be your authentic self, peak performance, all that kind of stuff's not constantly consuming it but at Shell mate, but my inside Info that I get from David working with them, he's like, they don't train for really for an opponent Fr Railey they, the opponent is, he's not a person.

Speaker 4:          00:46:07       He is a collection of skills and attributes and a body type and that's it. And we are training to get better every day. The goal is to be better not to train and, and why is that a good thing among the millions of reasons Josie Aldos out. Chad Mendez is in, if you spent all that time training for Josie Aldo and only Josie, all Dell, oh my God, Chad Mendez in questions, doubts, concerns, what are we doing? Game Plan. Instead, he was like, it doesn't matter who it is. Wow. And they train to get better every single day in everything. Wow. And that's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:42       Great Mindset. If you can pull it off, he's pulling it off. He is pulling it off right now. I wonder how much of what he's doing, what he's able to do is his own unique physical gifts. Um, the, the fact that he's been so successful so far with this strategy and he, he, he know also the people that he's training with. He's got it like fantastic training partners, great grappling with Gunnar Nelson. Great coaching and why, you know, I wonder what, I wonder if that is the way to do it. Cause I wonder is there going to come a time where he faces another guy like him, like a guy that on that level, and maybe it's Hofeld does Angela,

Speaker 4:          00:47:19       maybe it is, you know, um, I just sent the breakdown in, uh, and that Craig at the UFC said it's good to God. So they'll release it when their department does stuff. So it's coming out in the next day or breakdowns are fucking awesome, man. Really, really love them. I love doing them. I can't tell one, eight to 10 days, but that's of work on it. The ideas came over the last years, like just, but uh, how long has the piece, it's four minutes. Let's play. Can we play it? And now I can't play it. I know. I know. We can't talk her. Uh, it's Eh, tab. I know I've already thanked you, but thank you for making that happen. Oh, please. My pleasure man. Up like, uh, when you recommended my stuff to Dana, I flew down to the office with him and Craig and Dana and I were literally standing up acting out stuff while we were talking. It was really, really, really exciting and cool and it is cool to be doing that for the UFC.

Speaker 3:          00:48:15       Oh, it's awesome to have you, man. Yeah. Yeah. Well, when you first started doing, and we became friends and I would watch your stuff, I'd, you know, I just immediately was saying like, why this guy should be doing this for the UFC. I mean, your stuff is awesome. Yeah, thank you. He puts so much thought into it. There's so much and now and you can get so much out of it as a fan and someone is like, look, this fight is God damn apic. This conor Mcgregor Hofeld dos Anjos fight is an epic super fight. It's two champions in their prime, one of them coming off of a stunning 13 second knockout to win the title. The other one coming off of a brutal beat down of one of the most popular contenders. I mean dos Anjos looks like a goddamned murderer and connor looks like a freak. He does and he's like, just these, these two guys. It's perfect. It's the perfect fight. So to get some technical insight and to get a view into what your thoughts aren't, footwork and movement and what dos Anjos could possibly do to mitigate some of that footwork, what's going to happen if conor gets on his back though way Mendez got him on his back because dos Anjos is a lot bigger, a lot stronger and dangerous as fuck

Speaker 4:          00:49:17       with his submissions. Yeah, Chad Sephora really submitted people that guillotine bad, but conard use that threat to get up. But Chad was,

Speaker 3:          00:49:26       Chad was two weeks for that fire plus all the media obligations. There is no way a guy who's got a wrestling heavy strategy like Chad does, you're not going to be conditioned enough to go five rounds if two with two weeks he had to knock him out. And so he went in hard and early he pushed all his chips in. Connor's got a chin. It's made out of some fucking the same shit that wolverines bones are made out of. Adam Manteo. Oh my God. I never seen anybody take a Chad Mendez Punch to the face.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       Gotcha. And uh, he's, he was getting hit with a right hand corner. He was getting hit with it, whether or not now, I mean, uh, does annual says a southpaw too, so it changes things and he has seen knocked out pour. Ea was a south part and I think Brandao is a southpaw too. So he's has dealt with them. But on the other hand does Anjos took a Ben Henderson. Yeah. South Park. A pedes switches. Yeah. Uh, Jason High was a South Pollack. He's face planning of us. Please. Yeah. It's interesting, but uh, uh, breaking that stuff down when I looked at it. So my real goal is to, to try to influence. So I feel watch fighting and to make them see it the way that I see it. That's the actual goal. The goal is that I see this crazy, unbelievable stuff happening underneath some of the surface and I want to entertain people long enough that I can trick them into learning some of it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       And that's, that's the plan. And trick them into learning. That's funny. You just want to entertain them, make sure they're having a good time. And at the end of it, they are walking around going the, and by the way, that kick works this way. And they do it because if you go and you just stand there and you're like, have a diagram and you know, I think that was, there was always outside of like people were learning, fighting from your commentary and then there wouldn't be another show. So then they'd have to come back and they'd learned during the fights, which is great. I mean that was your, you did more to educate people by fighting than any person ever. Probably. I mean, I can't think off the top of my head. Anybody who has contributed more knowledge of fighting and it was done. You're entertaining, you're having fun. It's, they love your voice. So that was the learning. But then there's not another fight now for a few weeks live. We should learn some shit in the meantime and we should get you prepared so you don't have to teach them everything about this fight in the fight while calling the fight and making shits entertaining. We got to get you prepped to a, some knowledge.

Speaker 3:          00:51:42       Well, there's never been a time like this before where you could get so many different breakdowns, like the Gracie breakdowns of submissions that a Henna and he, Ron Do, Lawrence Kanchan starts to Jack slap stuff. There's so much good. So who's the guy that Kenny was plagiarizing? Uh, yeah, I forget his name off the top of my head. Yeah, that was a weird situation. Uh, did you talk about that? Did you talk about that much? Because you are a guy who would not happen in comedy do you were not having that? No, not really a, but it wasn't good. You know, it would Kenny's take on it is that Kenny, uh, he writes a lot of notes and he's been writing notes for years and years and that's, uh, that's what happened. He just failed to attribute, which, you know, may maybe the case, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. But I liked the fact that, uh, we found out. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:52:27       Lee Wiley. That's right. Yeah. He does great stuff. There's a lot of really ugly pebble video. That's right. Excellent. Yeah. If it's very good, uh, there's a lot. And when I was started to do analysis, there wasn't a lot and I was hoping now, just like when you started doing a podcast, you have, you had hundreds of people say, I started a podcast. Yeah. And just like I get guys emailing me, hey, I'm doing an analysis and I think, and I wasn't the guy who started it. I can't take any credit for that. Um, but when people get it excitedly, people were like, oh, shit. Fighting is way more interesting than just, I mean, the real thing that kind of would bother me is that wasn't, you know, a fight. What happened, this awesome stuff. What happened? Crazy things that had, you know, change the way that you understood how people moved and what happened when trained athletes fought each other and it meant something to him the next time that you'd fight the way they move, all that stuff and then people would be like, all right, he got it done at two minutes or the fifth, uh, two minutes of the third round.

Speaker 4:          00:53:23       What's next for this guy? Which is, that's a great conversation to, or what does this mean for the title rankings? Or you know, who are you going to call out? It was incest instantly looking ahead, fighting immediately was like, well, what's the next fight and how's it going to go down? No amount of like, what does it mean, what happened? I mean, we're taking human beings at the highest level of training and in a global experiment to figure out what is the ultimate way that human beings can do combat. And we're putting them there at personal risk to themselves for our entertainment and brilliant shit happens. We can't just move on. We can't just go, oh, well, you know, Johnny one or a GSP one or whatever. Well, what's his next fight? We got it. We got to honor that fight. We've got to honor the fact that these guys are giving that stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       Why didn't we both agree that the fighters of today, of the greatest fighters ever and the audience is far more knowledgeable today than they've ever been before? So when we're watching all these breakdowns and all these different technique videos like you, you have so much more access to mixed martial arts knowledge. It's, it's an incredible, like you ever follow any of those, a Bjj, a video, um, uh, one's on instagram. Yeah. Like viral Bjj. Holy Shit, man. Yeah. Some of those fucking moves. Like, I've never seen those. I've been doing Jujitsu for 22 years. I never seen some of those moves raise. He's incredible. Some of these guys have like some sick fucking transitions. Yeah. Amazing stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       Yeah. It, Jujitsu is a whole other fascinating world of its own right now, but uh, yeah, I just loved now that it's like it isn't just the outcome or the storyline around it or the shit talking. People are interested in the fight. Like the thing that's happening when these geniuses are actually moving. That just makes me, I'm glad that's happening. I'm so glad. Yeah. That's happening now because that happens in other sports too. Eventually at first just got to see homeruns man, we're just going to sit around until the home runs happen. Or like what if you're in football? People who love football didn't understand. They were just bored out of their tree booing when they ran the football one yard and they only chaired when it was like a long bomb, you know? Right. That's what happened. To some degree in fighting guys will get be against the fence or guys would be grappling and people would be like, oh, when is the, the fighting going to happen? We still see that. Yeah, we do.

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       We still see that especially when we go to like different markets outside of Vegas and the audience is not that educated and they start booing when it goes to the ground.

Speaker 4:          00:55:47       Yeah. Crazy. Crazy. It sucks. Um, I commentated taekwondo for the Pan Am Games. Really? Yeah. And I connotated as like eight, maybe more like 10 or 12 traditional martial arts in Russia for the world combat games. Wow. And it's super cool and I'm just seeing that Brazilian Jujitsu is moving the way that those sports moved in a lot of ways. Like taekwondo was awesome commentating that and the Mexican team won almost all the metals. Really? Yeah, because you can punch as we all know, but we don't do it because our coaches and the way that we've taught and the way we've celebrated the spinning and beautiful techniques, that's what we're doing. The, that space in between you and me being able to kick each other from here. The Mexican team entered that space, took it away and punched you in the body and they want almost all in like body punches, body punches, one almost cost and it's like the sport itself kind of agrees to do taekwondo and that happens in every sport and in Jujitsu.

Speaker 4:          00:56:50       Now I love Jujitsu, but sports, Jujitsu isn't really fighting anymore. All this bear and Bolo and all these interesting stuff, they're beautiful. It's fascinating and amazing sport. But if we are in an environment where we are going to sort of unconsciously agree that these are there structures and rules, we have the sport changes as soon as you remove punching, like a lot of these things, certain defenses to things as punch. So once we remove that you get this beautiful cool sport but it moves further away from fighting the same way every other martial art did. Well

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       it can, but it also doesn't have to like what is, one of the things I really love about what John Danaher is doing with Eddie Commons and Gary Tonin and these, these assassins that he's got out of Hens Zos in New York, is they're figuring out a way to use these leg lock transitions in a way that it's not dangerous to do. Like you would always, the traditional thought was when a guy goes for a leg and if you do it improperly, it is the truth. You're committing to arms to the leg and you're not gonna be able to defend against punches. We saw that with Frank Mir versus Ian, the machine. Freeman. Remember that fight frank was gone for that heel hook and Ian just kept punching him in the fucking face and you know, and they stopped him while he wasn't tapping and he's just slamming him in the face when

Speaker 4:          00:58:06       Alan Belcher, when he was fighting, what's his name? Paul Harris.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       Yeah. You don't see that anymore. Um, with the, the highest level Jujitsu guys, they put, they're putting themselves in a position, first of all, when a guy like gary tonin or eddie cummings grabs a hold of your leg, you have fractions of a second before your knee explodes. And so you, the, the transitions and the technique is so tight, you don't have that space to swing wild punches. They're not giving it to, they are putting you in a very, very dangerous spot immediately. And it's the technique and the thought process behind it and whether it's perfected by Donna, her, a bunch of other people. I know dean lister was initially a part of that as well. He taught those guys a lot and he was one of the early leg lock masters. But these guys are, they're doing it in a way where these techniques that I might've agreed with you just a few years ago really aren't for mma, like the 50, 50 and stuff like that. You're seeing those really applied MMA now.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       Yeah. The cool thing about the cool thing about fighting, like everything is cool, you know, um, but a another and a long list of cool things is, uh, it's how the money that exists. Like when we talk about why the UFC is a great thing. I think that UFC is an awesome thing when you monetize something more study and things happen to it. As soon as, as soon as you say you can become wealthy, if you get good at this gyms and businesses and things can pop up around it, it's speeds the evolution of how things happen. And uh, because Emma May exist as a way to get paid for doing fighting it. W uh, guys like Danaher will arc back with their study of, of the martial art back to where they get paid, which is fighting the UFC.

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       Well, it's interesting because you need a guy like a Donna her, you need one of those genius guys to just try to figure out what's the best way to approach this. Where are the problems? Well, the problems keep happening happening when you're going into the, the transition and the guy grabs this leg. Okay. How do we stop that? Well, let's look at it backwards. Let's do, let's attack it from this side. Now we're going to attack it this way. Like so many times when a guys would go for an arm bar from side control, you'd be inside control or you be an amount. You had grabbed an arm, you'd swing over and you'd go and you'd commit to that arm and then the legs would fly over for the DNS, right? Well, Eddie Bravo was one of the first guys to say, well, let's not, let's not hook it with the right arm saved.

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       You're going for someone's right arm and you turn a Rmr them. Don't Hook it with your right arm. Hug with the left and grabbed their leg. Yeah, did your other arm and then commit to it that way because this way you've stopped the defense and you've got a much more secure set of a offense and the weight. One of the reasons why people were going for it in the first place was because of the gate. Right now. The keys are really interesting thing because I think the GE is very good defensively and I think defensively it's one of the best tools to make sure that you using proper technique because you can't just explode out of things. You have to use the right position. You have to understand where your day, where you're in danger, when you're not in danger. However, when it comes to attacking the, gives you so many more, handles, so many more options and I think it's false security and I think you're way better off not using it to attack.

Speaker 4:          01:01:18       Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's a whole other part of the sport too. It's like you roll with these gay guys and they're like sneaking this thing out and you're like, oh shit, what is he doing? And now nevermind the fact that that's going to work. Just introducing that threat and you're like, oh wait, what's happening there? Now my brain isn't mindful where it's supposed to be. It's worried about this, which might be nothing. He's just pulling a piece of ag. It's, it is fascinating. Any kind of combat, any way that you put two people trying to best each other, it's going to be absolutely

Speaker 3:          01:01:47       key. Guys are doing some weird shit, man, where they're like taking their jacket off and wrap it around your head, strangling you

Speaker 4:          01:01:53       exact stuff. We're really going to use this thing if we're, it's going to be in there. But fighting too. It's like even how'd you Jitsu is used in fighting changes so much in such interesting ways, in ways that we've now seen happen over and over so many times that you can predict their future again. Like, you know, um, the, the one example that I always kind of used is, you know, I'm in your guard, so I do a can opener and then your guard opens, right? And then you discover, hey, wait a second alarm bar that and you'll armbar me. So I mean, your guard can open, opens your guard. Wait a second, you armbar me. No more can openers. That doesn't make any fucking sense. Danaher later it goes, George, we're going to Kent. Open a conduit of, but the dental her, what? I don't do a good French accent, but what about the arm bar we're going to can open him and shut down the arm bar.

Speaker 4:          01:02:43       We don't stop cat opening cause there's an orb are there. We just solve the problem and that kind of adjustment. You see it now in the guard. Like it blows my mind that in Jim's every west very smart coaches, they're like the guard is dead. We don't submit from the guard anymore. We use the guard. What's Brian? Oh fuck there's lots of good guys or tell you as a monster jam Jesus Christ. But think of the implications of that. This is, this is where I see the crazy aspect of it because we've seen this a million times. So all right guys, we're not going to submit from God are our use when we are in guard, we're going to use it to get an under hook threatened one of these three things and Heisler hips back out. And we're going to stand up. We're going to work on our standup more for here.

Speaker 4:          01:03:27       We're going to get back up. Okay coach, that's great. So now for the next year and a half, your job on top of me becomes hold me down, stop my stand up and hit me at my job becomes fight you to get back up. That happens for three months, six months, two years. That becomes the game. You hold me down and beat me up and I tried to get back to my feet. Your game on top hasn't even involved the real threat of submissions for two fucking years because all your training partners had just standing up. So your getting weaker at stealing with submission threats cause you never see them anymore. Your trading partners don't do them somewhere in Andy's Jim, you got Ben Saunders and guys, they're working on it. Not only are they getting better at it, you're getting worse at it. As time goes on, you're getting worse at it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:13       Inevitably all of a sudden it's like the guards back in play. Holy Shit. Everybody submit and guys off their back. Why he got better, but you got worse. The mindset of how to train that thing in the gym every day removed a very real threat because your training partners don't even throw it at you anymore. And that thing changes, you know? Yeah. You see that also with wrestlers that don't wrestle much anymore because of working on their striking. We kind of put the wrestling side and then they'd get out rustled and you was like, that's something you've got to stay on top of. You got to keep sharpening it. Yeah. There's just so many different variables in mma. It's one of the reasons why it's such an amazing sport. This is, there's so many different ways to go about it. I mean, you can just decide to Damien Maia it close the distance kicked guys, the ground user superior do you do to submit guys and you know, look like a wizard or you can wonderboy it where you're just standing.

Speaker 4:          01:05:00       I mean poor. There's an interesting fight, right? Damien Maia and wonderboy, that is a very fucking interesting. But if that ever happens, you know, uh, for um, uh, Ramdane and I has my partner, you met him at a show. We commentate a bunch of really old fights and it's really cool. Well that's nice. All pancreas. We just did a couple of conduits, old fights against, I can't remember. I have a uh, issue membering names. I know. It's cause I got hit in the head a lot for real. Like, or maybe it was like the drugs. No, four days or heroin. Exactly. Uh, I literally was thinking of that on the way down here. Um, but uh, uh, old, old fights and you see how different it was. Like you can spot the things where you're like, now a guy would not do that or he would do this.

Speaker 4:          01:05:44       Right. It just didn't know. And that's why I think it's crazy that fighting is so structured in how it's trained now. It's like, let's, let's put it this way, 2000 in 2030 does fighting look different than it does today? Oh yeah. Then why are we training it? Like it isn't changing. Like why, if we know that it is ever changing, why are we like digging in deep and saying we got it all figured out. Uh, you got to train your white tie, you've got to train and just kind of resting and gotta because someone will come along. That's what taxis dead, you know, that's what hotels did. They were like hotels. So this is the way to do it. I'm going to build bigger hotels, better hotels. We'll put pools in them. We, you know, we'll advertise them differently in somebody. It's like people don't want to fucking hotels.

Speaker 4:          01:06:24       It's airbnb comes along ruins hotels that the really ruining ozone, damaging them at the right place. Yeah. I mean people, tons and tons of people just don't even consider it anymore. And when I was coming down to La for the weekend, I was looking at how expensive hotels, where I was thinking about it. I don't really want to stay in someone's house. I don't know. Although I have friends who do it all the time. They love it, cameras and shit, and they're out to the kitchen. Beaten off. Yeah. I never thought of that. But now that I have, now that that's in my head

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       been caught. Some, uh, some woman was, uh, she was suing some man because he had set up like hidden cameras that were on in this house and man, what's wrong with us? You know, we want to see somebody naked. Yeah. Well the engine, it's full of naked. No, it doesn't matter. People want, they want naughty. Yeah. You know, they want, they want to be able to do things they're not supposed to do, I guess. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. There's something creepy but like spying on somebody. Yeah. Ooh, yeah. I mean, it is creepy. You can just go to youporn and watch people fuck all day long, but they don't want to, as soon as you think about the fact that somebody spying on you, that feeling that you get proves that it's creepy. Oh yeah. You know what I mean? Well, it's the, the know the technology, it's, it's never been available before where someone could remotely watch you in your own home. Like fairly easily. Yeah. He used to be, you know, just 10 20 years ago if they wanted to do something like that, they had to like set up some pretty elaborate equipment. Now I think he's a little tiny, tiny cameras are so small little go pro or something like that. Set it up somewhere. It can remotely access it. You have a bunch of different kinds of cameras they can remotely access share freaky that each mass outside of the park. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:06       When you think about any kind of technology can use it for good, you can use it to like a fat things. You can use it to make things better. You can use it for bad and I think there's like a perspective thing. I think with the way that we look at things, you know, the way that people look at things, it's like the perspective that you take is everything. You know, like if you look at something, you're, somebody says something to you, you and you give all this meaning to it and you assume you know what they mean and then you get mad. You don't have to do that. You can like just assign it no meaning at all and have whatever response you want. That kind of perspective is you come across a camera and you go, well wouldn't this be cool? We can like film guys training and we can like come up with all these cool things. I can do my job different. Or somebody like naked people without their permission. That's where we got it.

Speaker 3:          01:08:53       You know? Well it's just assholes. Yeah. You're always going to have assholes, you know? Uh, we were talking about like fighting today versus fighting 30 years from now. Why don't we train like it's going to be 30 years from now. I think one of the problems is we need to see it be successful. Like you need to see a guy like wonderboy fight. We go, oh, okay we got to learn some fucking sport karate. We've got to figure out how to do that blitz. We got to figure out how to slide back and throw those kicks the way they're doing it. And I still to this day thing, we haven't seen the level of traditional martial arts techniques that are, that exist in like a really good taekwondo match or really good kill Kachin match. There are guys in these other sports, you know, you've seen some guys like a moon toss re who's fighting the EOC, who's a national champion.

Speaker 3:          01:09:38       Yeah. He's a bad motherfucker with his kicks. So you seeing him, but you know, he, he's got to learn all that other stuff first. He's got to get me, had to rather learn all that other stuff first, get better at all these other techniques. And you know, perhaps there's, there's going to be some guys that are even better and more powerful than him. You know, that, that these traditional techniques I think are probably the most underused or the most underappreciated aspects of, of mma. I mean, when we saw Anderson Front kick Vitorin the face and there was like the first time we'd ever seen that, you're like, this is crazy that the first kick ever that they teach you is now the new kick. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:10:17       Uh, I know you had boss on earlier and I didn't get to see it. I love bus and he used to say straight up, no jabs, jabs in fighting a useless. Now that was a different era. Now he would say something different, I'm sure. But he was the people, they were products of Erez and then that other era, well we can't front kick. Well why not? Well we will get taken down. No, well don't get taken down. Let's just like that crown opener and the arm bar if you get taken to or whatever the issue was. But say the issue is getting taken down. If you get taken down off the front kick, it doesn't mean don't front kick it means front kick and figure out how to stop the fact that you're going to get it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:52       That's what the guys who are really good at that front kick. It's such a danger like Kyle noke when you went to fight in Australia.

Speaker 4:          01:10:59       Yeah, those are some, I swear some of these guys, uh, Shane Campbell's fighting I think Sunday. Yeah. And he's got a few finishes with their toe stabs. And I think some of the ones I keep pointing of this connor doll cause it looks funny. Um, the uh, I think of the ones that hit Mendez worth, we're toast abs and just roll the toes back and drill them in. And uh, so you're saying like roll the toes back down instead of pulling instead of pulling it back like with the ball of your foot, like taekwondo, make him like a fist. Like we're all them and then they stab it into the bottle. It's void. Yeah. Todd and all tie technique. Yeah. If you Google Shane Campbell tow stab, you'll probably see one that, one of his fights right before I got in the UFC, but lots of, I bet some of them are doing that now.

Speaker 4:          01:11:40       The ball of the foot, we can penetrate pretty deep. But when they commit to like literally drilling it in and it penetrates in and touches your organs, the meat they gets to me, those that I feel like I can kick through a door with a ball of my foot. That's your lifetime toe. I'm not going to be able to have that kind of impact. Do that toast tab and you hit an elbow, you're kind of fucks Ville. Well, I guess that's the risk of it. Like the reason you can do that as you did it since you were a little kid over and over thousands and thousands of times and it is harder and it is safer and it is smarter. But if you know that that spot is there, I mean, all of these things have to be the next answers. Cause with the next answer isn't just do what we're all doing only better.

Speaker 4:          01:12:23       Right? I mean, and it was kind of like, um, uh, who was it? Uh, uh, Matt Hughes, his coach. He was a, from that pub meal. Yeah. Military, military and frank shamrock. And these guys were like, okay, well you were a wrestler and I was a striker and that's all these things. I just got to get really pretty good at all those things. That worked for awhile. But now that everybody knows every single choice that you're making, every single position, it's, we're just playing within these rules that we've kind of agreed on. It's gotta be some other stuff we got. It's got to be things that you don't train. It's got to be things you haven't dealt with. It's gotta be thinks your training partners don't show you. That has to be the next answer. It has to always be the next answer. Yeah. I think movement is the big focus right now, right?

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       With Ido and uh, with all these are when Irwin Liqour, nick curse on focuses a lot on movement, a lot of plyometrics and explosion drills and movements, rules. And I think they're realizing now that w what's the glue in between the techniques is what would the really concentrating on. I think that was a big factor in the Johnny Hendricks, wonderboy Thompson fire for sure. It was the movement, the movement, the, and the, the, the fact that hendricks is so much more stationary. He just really wasn't able to close those distances or get out of the way. It didn't have that kind of footwork. And his game was just so dependent upon close range fighting. Yeah. He said, uh, you know, I kind of hoped he would trade in the pocket with me more. Why the fuck would he do that? He shouldn't say that. He should definitely not do that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:54       I feel like I just said, I kind of hoped he would fall down. Yeah. I um, I feel like I know why Mcgregor, I started doing that, that movement training. I could be wrong. I'm going to hopefully get the chance to ask him. But you remember the last time that I was here, we talked about that flow state. You know, when you achieve that flow state, the best guys are fighting that a hundred hundred percent right. And there that state of freedom, right. And condit was one of the first guys I really spotted that Kinda did that earlier before we chat about last time. And um, so you're seeing that a lot when you're in a true flow state, you are free, innovative, able to do things you weren't aware of, fully present in the moment. There's all of these things. It's about sort of true freedom. I think he believed that his body, he was his mind and it the thing has goals were freer than his body was allowing him to be, that if he was truly mentally free to fight that the, the thing that was stopping him was his physical movement limitations and I really believe that's why he went and pursued that kind of open movement because we're not going to become any freer than in a peak performance state.

Speaker 4:          01:15:02       So we have to free up our body if we're going to go further with this.

Speaker 3:          01:15:05       Well, it makes sense if you look at what people, well George, Saint Pierre, you know a lot of ways was ahead of the curve with this because of his gymnastics approach, but really the originator of the shit is is Hixon. If you go back and watch Hixon when Hickson was into the movement was gymnastic, unnatural Gal. He was in a lot of like crazy yoga things, a lot of flexibility and balance things. He was into that way, way before anybody right

Speaker 4:          01:15:30       was and personally was into building the body to do martial arts too. In whatever ways you can figure it out. You were just saying it half an hour ago. I don't know how long it's been, uh, that, uh, you tell Jujitsu guys, you got to get strong. You identified that and identified that all that long ago. He's like, okay, we figured out how we're going to move it. Now what do I, what can I do with my body to enhance that or take that further? Eddie with his flexibility's yes.

Speaker 3:          01:15:56       Well, it Hickson was always the best out of all of the gracies. He's, he's widely regarded as the greatest jujitsu artist ever. So if you look at Hixson in comparison to all the other ones, like hoist, when he was fighting, what was so impressive about hoists was that he wasn't a specimen and he was just a regular guy who was in shape obviously, but had really good technique would hixon is, is that really good technique with a freak athletic body, right? You know, a guy who can stand on a balance beam and do a full split holding onto his heel. I mean he's, he's really freakish in his ability to move his body. And physical strength was a huge factor in his ability as well. So if you look at Hixson in the old days in comparison to the other guys, you're seeing a much more physically robust guy, much stronger. And because of that, he was able to overcome. Like if you get two guys, they both have equal technique, but one guy is much stronger, that guy's gonna dominate. And that's just the way it is. You know, technique is hugely important. It's probably the most important thing. But once that's covered, physical strength is a huge attribute. Huge.

Speaker 4:          01:16:58       Then the physical strength becomes equal now. So then flag warning, then it becomes flexibility and movement. Anyone that's equal, it's just our minds like who's gun?

Speaker 3:          01:17:07       More creative, more creative. Who's more in the zone, who's more loose, who can pull the trigger? Easier. Psychological training. It's a huge factor. Huge. A lot of guys are getting into hypnosis now. Yeah. You know, I got hypnotized. Vinny shoreman hypnotize. Wow. Yeah, yeah. Here I wanted to see what it was like. He came and did the podcast and he was a, he'd been training, he's trained a bunch of guys. He's GE works with Joe Schilling and a bunch of different, uh, kickboxers and Moy Thai guys. And I just want to know what it was all about and what was it like? Legit, man, it's legit. You know, I was like, okay, what is, what is hypnosis is trying to fight it? No, no, no. I, I didn't want to do that. I wanted to just, I want him to him to hypnotize me. See what it's like.

Speaker 3:          01:17:47       You definitely go into a state. You'd definitely go into some strange state of consciousness. I wouldn't say you're asleep because a, I was, I heard him talking, you know, I remember, I remember hearing Vinnie's voice, but I was most certainly hypnotized. Wow. I was definitely there, you know? And um, it's like, like you're going into like a, almost like a drug induced. It feels real weird. That's what I felt like for four days. I don't think it's that quite that bad, but, uh, it's, it's a very, it's a very strange state. It's, it's, it's, it's very difficult to describe it and compare it to something else because I don't think I've ever experienced anything like it other than maybe a state that you get into sometimes when you're doing like a sensory deprivation tank or I guess you would do if you were doing like heavy meditation, you get into some weird alternative state of consciousness. Wow. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:18:41       A lot of guys do. I'm visualizing training, but with, uh, with, uh, I don't know if there's a lot of the coaches wouldn't call themselves a hypnotist, but they lead it. So they lead you through it. You've got your eyes closed and David, uh, uh, does it with some of the spg guys and other people and he says, you apps, as you're getting them to go through and visualize it, you see them moving, you see them sweating like you, they are experiencing the fight in their mind. They are visualizing everything and it's probably very similar and uh, but you lead you through it and at the end they feel tired. They feel mentally tire. They feel they've, they've done it. And that that idea that you visualize, I mean if we do something, our brain is doing it right. So if we don't physically do it, but our brain does it, you definitely get huge real true value from it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:27       Well it's been proven, it's been proven that people can improve as much through visualization as they can from actual physical movement is as long as you actually commit to it and you know, don't be all fucking weird and like half it and you know, you have to think of it as if you're doing it and if you can think of it as if you're doing it, your mind will take those same pathways. I know that guys have learned new Jujitsu techniques that way. Like you, you visualize yourself pulling them off and then when you're training they just, they just come. They just come to you.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       Yeah. That just shows you what your brain can do it. Why it is the most important part. I mean, by the time we've learned how to do everything, we're going to fight and you're walking down there and if you haven't prepared mentally, everything else was always to time. If you can't go in there and be at an optimum state free of the worrying about the consequences. Oh Man, I'm going to like how much would I need my wind bonus or what if I lose this fight or, and you can't have any of that. You have to be like truly free to perform and guys will spend years trainings, the physicality and the technical stuff and then not have a plan for that. When Cruz said that, um, you know, ring roster, octagon shock or whatever is yeah, Russ is not real. I 100% believe that I hundred percent agree with them.

Speaker 4:          01:20:40       It's real. If you think it's real, it's not real. If it's not real to you. And, but the way it became not real to him is he prepared for it. You know, this is the second time I'm in this room. I'm more comfortable in it than I was last time. Um, Jamie and you are way more comfortable than Brendan job who is more comfortable than me. Do you know what I do? Because it's the environment and uh, Bj Penn used to go and train for a fight and he'd have, um, a, uh, a rough and a fake ring announcer and an audience and the walkout and he would create all of that before he fought. So that hue, that stuff wasn't new because the first fucking time you're standing in there and bruce buffer is doing that crazy shit at you. If you haven't prepared for that, all the next thing you know, you either wake up or you somehow won, but you really don't remember anything like that.

Speaker 4:          01:21:29       You're looking at them. It's like you, that can't be the first time that you've looked at Bruce Babbitt, but it has to have been in your mind 30 times. It's like, right, this is where I belong. I'm supposed to be here. I belong here. I earned my way here. Fucking right. Bruce buffers introducing me because the whole world's going to see how fucking good I am. You can't be like, oh shit. When you see the UFC does jogging over there, it's like, yeah you can't, that can't be new. That has to have happened dozens or hundreds of times in your mind when you go in there. It's interesting because a lot of these guys, their member mental preparation is just doing it and learning once you've done it instead of preparing for it and then once you're actually doing it, you go, this is what I've prepared for for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:22:09       Uh, and even just all the way along, like if there are, we all should learn stuff like that. That's what I say all the time. Sometimes I'll like use an example of something that I do or my friend does or whatever and I don't mean to put it back to myself, I'm saying we should all try to do this. You look and you prepare for stuff and you, you go back and it's the work, the work that you did. That's what matters. You're not any, you're just a guy, but you're a guy who worked like crazy, prepared, like crazy, made notes of the things that you did. When you can go back and look at your journal or your notes and see everything you've done in the day or afternoon of that fight, that stuff is fighting that all of your work is fighting you all. You got to go in, go in there and have fun.

Speaker 4:          01:22:52       The work's been done. That's the state you have to be in. And the reason I mentioned, I have a stack of every breakdown I've ever done, all the work, every note, and it's like this high. And I bring that with me. When I went to meet Dana and Craig, I had in my suitcase when I went down to meet them and Vegas, cause I look at that, it's like, right, I'm supposed to be here. I'm really, I worked really hard on this stuff. I'm supposed to be talking to these guys. This is where I'm supposed to be. If I don't have that, you can be like, well what, uh, what, what should I, what do I, you know, you can't be crushing. You'd have to look at all the work that you did and on that walk to the cage, I had terrible performances and I want are two good ones.

Speaker 4:          01:23:26       And the best one was the last one cause I understood what state you were supposed to be in. You couldn't be scared. He couldn't be angry. He couldn't be out to get them. You had to be fucking free. You'll love martial arts. You love fighting. This is what you wanted to do. You don't have to be here. You get to be here. That's, that's the state you have to be in when you do a breakdown. So if you do a breakdown for conor mcgregor and Hoffeld dos Anjos, how do you begin? What do you, what do you do? Do you watch footage? Do you think about what you already know? How do you, how do you begin to break down? So I got to know what my point is. And the point is, like I said, to influence the way people watch, fighting in a way that's positive and make them learn stuff and you'll hope it influences other people who influence stuff because you want people to take, you want to inject these ideas into the world.

Speaker 4:          01:24:20       So that has to be where you start. If you start from that point, it's not too I got to earn money or I got to like get clicks and nothing. You, I want people to see how fucking amazing this is. So you start from that point. That point could be months in advance. Then there's things that you've been watching and studying and looking at and full immersion things like you know, this movement stuff that we're talking about or, or comparisons that you make of how people work against the cage and compare it to another sport or all these ideas are all floating around you. Hopefully you've got 50 of them and then the fight comes up and you see, oh fuck, it's conor mcgregor and half fail dos Anjos so that's got to start brewing. I know I asked Craig the accepted mine tonight. So the next one is, is Jones and cormier.

Speaker 4:          01:25:06       I'm on that already. What's going on in that fight? Okay, what do I look back at their other fight? Do I look at at how they do what at, what is happening, what happened, what's going to happen, how's it going to happen? And where's the fucking cool in it? So that starts immediately and then you go, you might have a couple of ideas, you might have some, oh well you know range man. Like there's, there's this four ranges kind of thing I've been playing around with and I did it in the, Ronda won, but they didn't release it as that w that version. So I was sure applies to Jon Jones. So it'll start, I'll start thinking about it in terms of four different ranges and how he managed the edit your versions. No, I send in multi. I sent in multiple versions for that one only because they were like, they didn't know what I did or how I did it or how I work with them or whatever.

Speaker 4:          01:25:52       Actually it's been super cool. Like I send it in, they're like, wow, it's great. And put it out. But the first one, Dana was like, well, can you give me like four minute version and a five minute version of one minute? I just want to for him to wrap his head around it. So the first one that I sent in was many different ones and then since then, and they've been fucking super cool. They're just like, Hey, I think this guy's good at this. Yeah, I couldn't go do that thing you do, which is exactly what you hope. Right. You know? So, but that one now you sent them multiple and it was mostly just so they could get a wrap their head around it. Also, you're, I mean, you're working in a company, they got to figure out who is this guy? You know, he talks fast and it seems enthusiastic as he smart, as easy to work with.

Speaker 4:          01:26:33       How does it take direction? You know? So you've got to figure all that stuff out. But I think they figured out pretty quick. He's like, Oh yeah, he just likes doing this stuff. And he does a good job. And so it's very, very committed to it. If you were smart and you were running a business and obviously the UFC is very smart, they look at a garlic you with, he goes, just tell him to do it. He's, he's going to do it. He likes you to do it, right. Yeah. That's been, that's how it's been. You're much direction. Yeah, that's, that's how it's been. Um, and uh, but in that one, so yeah. So I'll look at it and now I've got like, that fight is not for eight weeks, so I'll still do other breakdowns and fighting. I work in the meantime I'd with, you know, that's, there are a family, I, I do 40 hours a week of TV there and I built these around, really do 40 hours, least of ours, not have hours of TV, but I'm in there five days a week.

Speaker 4:          01:27:20       We're a 24 hour fight channel, so there's six. I don't want an American. Uh, it's on like xbox and like all those other things, those like Roku and I'm, all of that kind of stuff. And then it's in the tristate area and it's in Texas. I could sit and it has, it doesn't have national carriage, but it's got pockets of carriage and like a no brainer. Yeah. As a channel that just had fights on all the time when people would just go like how many times you've been flipping through the channel, bored looking for something, then you go to wall, always go find some on the fight. Jail. Yeah. And uh, I mean in Canada the timing was pretty good because George was a big star right now in Ireland, fighting is the thing. And, and Canada was like that and that allowed us to kind of get entrenched in there.

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       But when all day, every day is fighting, literally it's like there are times, Hey Robin and John and John Go and talk about, you know, this news. So I'll do on a Monday we'll do five rounds, which was an analysis show. We'll do two or more chats of what's going on in the news. I'll do five rounds today, which is a podcast version, but it's for television. And then on Tuesday we'll do similar stuff and then call two hours of all the vintage pancreas. And then the next day called two hours of deep on a Japan, so all day, all the time. So for me, this is a fucking amazing thing, right? Because this is my life's work. It's my job and passion and obsession and, uh, that's, I get to do it all day, but I do that and I'm now making these breakdowns. So they have to happen around that.

Speaker 4:          01:28:50       But all day long you've got to be ready. It's something hits you or you pick up on something or there's a sea change or there's some kind of little movement going on in something, well, I got to break down in six weeks. Maybe I can explore that for that. Then you get excited. You know, the conor won. I was, I'm very interested in this guy and I look at these guys, you know, Chris Weidman's work ethic that taught me how to work really hard. You know, I, I was kind of worked hard, but you look at this guy, okay, that's how, that's how it's winners work. And then, um, Mcgregor's growth mentality. It's like, okay, that's how I'm going to get better and better and better and he's innovating. I got to innovate. If I innovate, you want other people to spread the idea. I want people to rip my stuff off cause then they'll rip off what I did a year ago and then a year from now I'll do new stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:29:37       Like you want it all to influence how people see fighting because I think fighting is the coolest thing and if they see it through my eyes, they'll think that too. You know? But you want it, you know? So you get, you caught, you learn about innovating from him. You look at what Ron does going through and you learn how to, how do people deal with that? How would I deal with that? And then just get, I'm super attached to all of these people in these things and these experiences and I kind of get to live them out and learn from them. You know? When you look at conor and Hoffeld no song Jules, how are you? How do you think that is going down you, there's obviously a bunch of different ways they can interact with each other. Once the cage door shuts and the fight begins, how do you, how do you perceive it?

Speaker 4:          01:30:20       Well I go through fighting gets more and more and more complicated and then you go through these periods where it gets really, really simple and then it gets more and more complicated. And that's kind of the process of my learning. And right now I'm looking at it kind of simply. Obviously connor wants to get, connor has the left hand that knocks people out. So almost everything he kind of built was to put himself in a situation is to hit guys with his left hand and knock them unconscious. So that's our job. We need to knock you unconscious with this. So what are some of the problems that could prevent that from happening? Well, you can get ahold of me, you can push me up against the cage, you can do all these things. And what are the ways that I could increase the likelihood of doing that?

Speaker 4:          01:31:00       Well, I can fuck with you. That seems to help works for everybody who's good at it. But ultimately if dos Anjos puts him on his back, he's in real fucking trouble. It's in real fucking trouble. I agree. This is not kind of a pretty good Jujitsu guy. This is not kind of this a vicious violent guy who will happily stay on your guard till caves your face and until you overreact and then he'll start passing. Then he'll start abusing. You're in trouble. So, but at the same time we can't look at it and go, I must stay off the ground at all costs because that infringes on connors being connor. So he has to play the game of Stephen Thompson played. That has to be, that's the game most of these guys are looking to try to do right now. Thing about dos Anjos though, he's very fast and he's very good at closing the distance. You know, I was really shocked and the Pettis fight how quickly he pulled the trigger and how he leaves no space. He leaves no space for you to analyze his movement and prepare to counter. He's on you before you could get that breathing right.

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       The pedes one is definitely, this was one of the ways I was going to break it down, so when you're looking at it, there starts to be multiple different ways because no thing is one thing is 50 things. One of them was dos Anjos might be looking at this as this is similar to the pettis fight and so what? What would you do different if you were connor, if your goal, if your job was to beat this guy, pedis didn't move laterally very much because he's also really good at the end. Him and Duke and lots of people I've been working on. As you back up delivering with power right back up, a lot of it has to do with the stomp of the back foot. Bam. You know, and so they were working on that. This guy is a pressure fighter. As he moves forward, we're going to rip them.

Speaker 4:          01:32:41       We're going to hurt them, we're going to drop him. We're going to discourage them. Just never, never got it off somewhere. Now my orbital bone is broken. My idea of lulling you in and hurting you bad isn't working dog. The the adjustment is we got to start moving laterally. He never really orbital in the first round. First Punch that hard left hand. Yeah. Wow. Yep. Now the one, so then we're looking at it where connor and his people and they're taking a positive approach to it. What, what can we exploit? One thing does hang us, does all really the only thing that he, if you're looking at it and going, what, what one thing jumps out as less than perfect for this killer champion and that he, he really telegraphs his punches. He telegraphs them a lot. You see it, right? You see, and when I break things down, I'll watch fights in slow motion sometimes dozens of times and now our agile all I see,

Speaker 3:          01:33:34       did you see the video that somebody put together? It's like an animated Gif file of a Aldo chasing after connor connor landing the left hand. And then the same exact movement by dos Anjos chasing after pedis but, or chasing after Donald Rather. But Donald Donald doesn't land the punch like you see very similar movement. He sees.

Speaker 4:          01:33:55       That's what he says he sees. Now when I look at him, I, he does and I, I'm a, I actually hate to criticize it anyway. I don't feel comfortable with, I don't feel qualified to criticize. And I, that's just a personal thing. I don't think other people shouldn't. I just, I'm looking at 90 to 90 to 99th percentile fighters and I'm some guy who won a couple of fights and was terrible in fights and, and I'm, uh, you know, I just, I don't feel qualified to, to always criticized because I don't know how to,

Speaker 3:          01:34:30       I don't even know if it's necessary. Yeah. I feel like the way I look at fights, so what I try to look at fights is I look at him like we're looking at mathematics. I'm looking at like, there's an equation going on and one, there's values and there's numbers in, in one side and his values and numbers and the other side, what's fascinating to me about this fight is there's, there's equations where you have to factor in many things. You have to factor in power, you have to factor in technique, you have to factor in the ability to execute and you also have to factor in persona and personality and just charisma. And it's one of the things that conor brings to the table that's hard to, it's hard to monetize or not monetize. It's hard to quantify. It's hard to measure how much he fucked with all those head.

Speaker 3:          01:35:16       Sure. Although just chased after him and get lit up like that. I mean, what, what was it that caused, that was it, there's a, there's many possible factors, but all these movements in interactions that they have, I think you can almost look at them like a mathematical exchange. Like there's certain guys like Ed Short, fuse, Herman, great guy, tough guy, very good fighter. Um, you're never going to confuse him with wonderboy Thompson. Nope. When it comes to like his footwork, footwork and his movement, if you looked at those two guys, mathematically, he looked at them as an equation. You Go, this side is very lopsided in its movement. You know, like if you have $100 in one hand and $10 in the other hand, the hundred dollars is worth more than $10. That's just, it is. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:36:01       Yeah, you're right. Um, uh, and all of that prefacing it was coming, uh, to say that now that I've watched through the eye that I'm thinking it's connors, I watching him and his Iwatch and Connor, I see a Deus Angeles as being taken to the best level of what you can take. Guys who still are kind of sturdy. There's still got that old version of strength, different, not sort of free and flowing just, and you see his telegraphing. That doesn't mean he can't fuck you up. Like just cause I would see that doesn't mean you can do anything about it or stop it. Or if he ends up on the ground, he's like, who's fucking telegraphing now? You know, none of that may matter. But that is what I definitely see now that when I'm picturing what is connor seeing? Like you see, boom, move back, boom. Like it's, it's a much more sort of lady bird and it's built around an old sturdy style of building a fighter and condit and oh and Mcgregor and all these guys believe that. The answer to that is not only mobility where we move our feet, but how we move through space. You know, conduct comes on weird angles and different things and that's gotta be what he's seeing. Whether that matters or not, it, it's suddenly doesn't matter at all. If he puts you on a backend, caves are facing,

Speaker 3:          01:37:21       he's got, he's got some very good movement himself though. Dosantos may telegraph things a little bit, but it's because he puts so much power into his shots. What's shocking about him though is his ability to close the distance. It's very fast and he's not, you know, that's one of the things that have disagreed with, with con. What Connor said is it, he's a slower like stuck in the mud version of Aldo. Like, man, I don't see that at all. I see a fucking savage.

Speaker 4:          01:37:48       Yeah, he is a fucking savage. Like, as I watched it, it's like you're looking for what you could think you could exploit. And that's the thing. It's like, okay, I think I can, I think I can see the things coming now that may turn out to not be true, and that's a bad time to figure that out yet when you get ripped in the face. But uh, but at the same time, it's also like the dude is just so aggressively violent. Um, but whether it's mcgregor is not at the, in my opinion yet, or we haven't seen it at the Tom cruise level. But let's say that you and I have a really great fighter and somebody says, well, give you guys $1 million if you can have this guy beat dominick Cruz in five years, what do you do? If we start figuring out, trying to teach him the same movement as I'm dominick Cruz, the most we can hope for is him achieving dominick Cruz five years earlier. You know, the five years of learning it, dominant cruises improved for five years. Right? We've got to figure out the answer to make it not about that. That's the hard part. That, and that's what connor and his people I think believe is it will make it not about what he wants it to be about.

Speaker 3:          01:38:53       Well don't you think with a guy like dominick Cruz, one of the reasons why dominic has created that styles, cause he's not capable of putting a guy way with one shot. He's not that kind of conor mcgregor one punch death touch kind of a guy. He just doesn't have that. So he's got to hit you with the volume and he's also very smart and very smart guys don't want to get hit. So what do they do? They incorporate a lot of foot work and dominic's footwork is pretty fucking spectacular. I watched him, we were all just hanging around backstage one day and he and Brian Stann in DC, we're talking just joking around and a DC said, show me some of that footwork Brian, or show me, show me some of that footwork. Um, uh, dominic and he steps in with this shuffle and then sidestep. And I'm like, whoa. Like when you see him just playing around when someone's standing in front of them, like a Brian, Stan was just standing there for him and he'd just like, she don't like the way he's moving, calculate that. You have to figure out like what you think he's coming this way, but he's going that way and then he's coming this way again. You're like, wow, this is amazing. Like improvised. Like these are like very specific, very, uh, the, the amount of efficiency involved in these movements are excellent

Speaker 4:          01:40:07       to wild. Um, and it's that same thing we were saying. You know, I, I don't do submissions from guard anymore, so all my training partners are not dealing with that. Some guys quietly just build in the shit out of that. Dominick's been too in that for 10 years. If you've tried to figure that out now, good luck. 10 years. Well, here's what I want. He did it in front of everybody. They all saw him do it and they still let him do it and they didn't try to, you know what I mean? He did it right out in front of everybody's nose.

Speaker 3:          01:40:32       It's hard to figure out when you watched him do it. Even while he was doing it with Tj, I was like, Calculus. He, there's so many movements that he's, he's capable of doing. There's so many different combinations of steps and exchanges and you think he's stepping this way and he switched stances and he goes off to the left and he knows you're going to step in. Like, is this a movement trill? Yeah, that's fine. If you want to catch up to that. He's been building that for 10 years in front of everybody and everybody sat around going, well that's just dominic. Yeah, I mean he's different. That's incredible. Dominic would tell you he's not different. He would say, if you did this for 10 years, you could do it too. You know what? I wonder why he gets plantar fasciitis. Exactly. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's just incredible.

Speaker 3:          01:41:17       I mean that's, that's his solution for having, you know, he says he has bitch hands, he jokes around about it cause he has small hands and he's broken them several times. I mean, he put away Mitchell rocky in the first round, but it's very rare that he puts guys away. He just doesn't have the physical frame for it. But because of that, he's developed all this incredible movement. It's one of the things I always tell people when you learn Jujitsu, don't learn Jujitsu from a gorilla learning from an Eddie Bravo or you know, a small guy, uh, you know, a small physical like a guy was not imposing. Those guys are the ones you really want to learn technique from them because they've had a develop that technique. It has to be laser sharp because they don't have the ability to gorilla out of things. Now when you, when you learn Jujitsu from really big people, man, it's rare that they're technical.

Speaker 3:          01:42:04       It's really rare because they can make it work. Yes. Yeah. You want to bear it, Yoshida, right? You want a little tiny guy that has just laser sharp technique and Eddie Bravo, a heuler gracie. You know, a small person who's just got fucking razors, demendez brothers, perfect examples, small guys with razor sharp technique. And if you watch them roll against even bigger guys, their technique is so fucking sharp they they can get through. Whereas like if you find a big guy who's got gorilla Jujitsu and he fights a bigger gorilla, he gets fucked up. That's just what you said earlier when the hoist went into ufc one because they knew it would be that much more amazing if the little dude did a sort of, that's not really what happened though. That's the standard. That's the standard description of what happened. What really happened was they couldn't control Hickson.

Speaker 3:          01:42:57       Hickson was the master of the family. Everybody knew who was the king, but you couldn't, like if Hicks and one, he would be like, I want $10 million and now I'm going to go surf, and he was just doing them to fucking wanted, I mean hixon truly marches to the beat of his own drum and no one could control him and so his brother was not really interested in putting Hixon in that position. The idea was put hoi sin if voice lost. Then you go into negotiations with Hickson and you get hixon because Hixon is going to fuck everybody up. It would have changed everything though if we, it would have been different the way he did it would have been different. Like if you ever looked at some of the brutal beat downs, the Gracie in action beat downs at Hixson did. He's so God damn strong. He's not just unbelievably technical with his Jujitsu, but also really physically, really physically strong. I think some of the audience, a lot of them maybe wouldn't have gone, oh my God.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       Jujitsu's amazing data gone. Holy Shit, this guy's a killer. And hoists being there. It was hoist fighting tonight too. I don't, I know it was this, we're sitting here, hoist is going to fight and like three hours is fifth in his fifties isn't at least 50. Right? I think the 10 or 10 and him are both 50. Yeah. Just let them choose up. Let them juice. Yeah. I mean they're probably Gunna, if they can get around their fat, you know what I mean? Like the 50. Think about being 50 and I uh, I still have this little tiny hint in the back of my mind somewhere that I could fight one more time. Like it's just hidden back there. You were just talking about your head. I know that your, your is not so hot. Yeah. Uh, the um, I have a weird sort of perspective on that.

Speaker 4:          01:44:39       Uh, one that's why I think we have to celebrate these fights way more because these guys are getting hurt and they, they're doing it for their, or adventure or their reasons, but they're still getting hurt. But, um, I was in Belize and with my wife and it was beautiful actually. It's beautiful. And you meet, there's a huge percentage of men over 40 that are blind and yeah, they're blind because they have their big at one of their biggest crops is cashews. And something about the process of cashew farming makes you go blind in five years or 10 or 20 at some point. Yeah. Certain certain people who work in cashew farming, it's known that you will go blind. Holy Shit. Um, so when you're 20, cashews are not worth going over. Man. And so when you were 20 and you say, I'm going to be a cashew farmer, you're doing it with the knowledge that you're going to be blind one day you full knowledge.

Speaker 4:          01:45:33       Cause you've known your grandfather, you knew what a uncle there's was just a certain percentage of people and they do it because at the end they will provide for their family. It's a good career. You will uh, take care of your kids. And they do it knowing, and people go and they work in mines. People do all kinds of things that harm themselves. But you need to know that it's happening. You need to be fully informed and make a solid decision that this is what you want to do. And a lot of 17 year olds who go in and start boxing or whatever, don't have all that information. No they don't. But if you have it and you're like, this is my passion. This is all I want to do, this is what I want to do with my life. I was put on earth to fight.

Speaker 4:          01:46:10       I know there'll be repercussions for this in my future. And I'm choosing to do it. Go do it man. It's a free society. You can eat as much sugar as you want and that'll kill Ya. You know you can do it, but you want people to know the dangerous. I have no idea about cashew farm and he, did you find anything on that Jamie? Please don't tell me that. That's a myth. I didn't see anything about blindness, but there's like blood cashews are coming up and there's the way that they farm them and get good them do shelled is pretty bad and it causes people in intense pain cause there's some sort of a liquid that comes out of them. We pulled a show, I don't know if penalty. It's a chemical that's used and I don't know. I don't even know what cashew shell.

Speaker 4:          01:46:45       I don't know either. But it was something that was mentioned more than a couple of times in, in um, whoa. That's amazing. Yeah. How weird. So I mean that chemical could be connected to pain, blindness, maybe one of the effects. But that was the story that I was told more than a few times. Uh, down there about that don't even look real. It looks like like Avatar plant. It's true. No, it doesn't look real. It looks like some sort of a weird, crazy squash. But if you decide you're going to go farm that stuff and you know what the outcome is and you do it anyways, that's your, you chose to do that for whatever your reason.

Speaker 3:          01:47:21       So you're not finding anything on cashews causing blindness guys. Just try it. Give it a, give it a shot. Yeah. It just makes me sad that these people obviously don't have a whole lot of options. It makes me not want to buy cashews, but then again, then they don't have any money. Right. The fuck do you do? Yeah. Um, yeah, fighting is, is also some people can get away with it. Bas rutten who was here on Wednesday, obviously former UFC heavyweight champion, one of the greats, one of the real pioneers of the game. Sharp as a tack. No problems mentally at all. I mean, boss was just, he was our 10 he's speaking a second language by the way. Yeah. You know, he speaks Dutch. So in English he smooth as silk, he's talking fast, he's got all these great stories. His memory sharp as a razor is noah.

Speaker 3:          01:48:06       No problems with him at all. And then of course we all know guys that are punchy and um, I've known a lot of guys from the time when I was a teenager and now today I can't talk to them anymore because they're fucked up guys from my old boxing gym, they're fucked up man. They're, they're, they have real problems. Like they're very, very compromised. And I feel very fortunate that I'm not, I'm sure, I'm sure there's something going on. I'm definitely, I definitely got hit a lot, so I'm sure there's something that didn't go well up in there. Probably made me more impulsive, more angry or more, I don't know. I mean, I don't know what it is, but overall I got out of it pretty unscathed. But that's cause I stopped fighting when I was 22. I realized at that age I was like, this is, I'm already getting headaches and this is, there's no future in it. Back then there was no money in it. Back then there was no mma. It was just kickboxing and I was like, man, I'm not, this is not my, you know, I was way better at taekwondo then. It wasn't kickboxing. You know, I was, my kicks were my biggest attribute and I was learning how to box more and in that learning I was getting the fuck beat out of me.

Speaker 4:          01:49:13       I definitely, the most abuse I took was boxing. I love boxing. Fun. I love it. And I took a lot of it. I remember I got, I got a couple of concussions. One for sure that I remember. It's almost like life was different the moment after that concussion, like the way that I saw the world was different after I took that one punch. It was just training. Oh. So I just, I don't know, my perspective, my pr perception or something in like in what way? I had a headache and I threw up that night. So it was, I was in lethbridge and you know Jordan man. Yeah, his dad, Lee is a good friend and Lee and Jordan were out of town. And I went to train and this guy Dan torture chambers, who is a big powerful good one, 80 fiber. And uh, you were sparring with one.

Speaker 4:          01:49:56       Yeah. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. I actually danced at one 85. Yeah. So you're saying this to hundreds to 10 and I thought we were just going to light spar, but that's not what they do. And I took a crazy straight, uh, oh yeah, he was a south and I took a crazy straight laughter or two from him. And then immediately something was different. And then I started slipping it and hitting him with my left hook and I was happy. There's moments in fighting where you know, you find out you're just not, I'm, I'm not like Chris Weidman and you know, that's just the truth. But then there's moments in a fight or inspiring where you're like very proud. Like when threatened with danger, my answer was to fucking hit it back as hard as I could. Right. So got through the round or rounds and then I just, I had a headache.

Speaker 4:          01:50:40       I couldn't think. I went in, I ring announced that night. I started throwing up in the back and I just, my thought process was different. I was single at the time and there's really cute girl was asking me to go hang out with her and I just couldn't focus and I got better a month or two later, but I feel like that day was different like that. After that, yeah. I really feel like I saw things differently or thought differently or it just, it's a moment. It's a very distinct moment. Like that time I almost didn't get off the couch from the, you know that that moment I was different after it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:14       Oh Wow. No, you didn't even get knocked out. No, that was really crazy. You Bell rang, but you kept sparring, so you series still mobile? Yeah. Your legs were working. Got, nope.

Speaker 4:          01:51:26       Okay. Then after, after that sparring, the rest of the, I didn't really train anymore and then he gave me a ride back and the rest of the day, even the ringing outs, I think I was probably behaving very strangely during it. And I don't remember that day super well other than telling that pretty girl that I couldn't hang out with her because my head hurt so much. Uh, I remember the rest of the round though, and I remember and I got a concussion in the first couple of shots of my first fight too. And I fought till about the middle of the second round and I knew I was different. Like you just know. But it's cool in a weird way that you go and keep fighting because now I understand it when I commentate or when I'm analyzing it. I've had that experience and that's why I fought, was to have that understanding. But I know what it is to fight with a concussion or spar with a concussion and you see that guys do it. They're hurting round one and they'll fight all the way through sometimes when

Speaker 3:          01:52:16       I wonder what, if anything, they're going to figure out in the future to mitigate some of the problems of head impacts. You know, whether it's going to be something with stem cells or some sort of a new method of rehabilitating and healing people. It's so depressing to me to watch this incredible problem solving at its highest level event like mma or like boxing or kickboxing or anything along those lines. What Paul, but knowing that anytime like go con Saki lands a head kick on somebody, that guy might not ever be the same again and that is a big fucking factor that I, I really get upset when people downplay that. Like when you see someone get head kicked and knocked dead, they might not ever be the same again. That is a fact. I know guy back when I was a young kid who got kicked in the head and the doctor told him, I don't want you to ever do combat sports again. I don't want you to ever do contact sports again. I don't want you playing football. I don't want you to do it. You like stop. You have to stop. Like you're, you're, you got fucking killed and you survived. You got real lucky. And you see guys like that, they get hit like that and then they're fighting five months later, six months later and they not the same. You could tell they're not the same. They can't take a shot anymore. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:53:35       it is spooky. It, you don't know what the answer is. Uh, cause there isn't really one now other than the not, you can't spar with big guys like that and do it because it's fun and it's fun to fight. You should never, and most guys aren't doing that as are many guys are not doing that as much. But it's, you know, this is, to me, when you get the chance to have people who have trained their whole lives to help us have an experiment in combat right now, in front of all of us that has such a beautiful and wonderful thing in humanity. Like peep, we were fighting as a part of what we do fighting as a part of us getting here. It may be a part of our future depending on where we are and what's happening and different aspects of a fighting is a part of us.

Speaker 4:          01:54:17       And to see it done at that level and this sort of almost global experiment kind of way. It's beautiful. It's this wonderful, incredibly artistic thing. And, but it's, it has the downside. And that's another reason. It just sickens me when I see the way people respond to a Rhonda or respond. Connor's gonna lose one day and how they're going to respond to that guy, you know, uh, uh, Johnny Hendricks, uh, lost. How are people responding to this? Because these guys are just doing incredible, incredible things for the, the furthering of what humanity is capable of. Well, people love to attack people when they lose. Like the way hendricks last, I saw people attack, you know, in law. I'm like, God dammit, look, I just fought a wizard. You know, he fought like a real striking wizard and he learned something. People should have fucking me weighed against Woodley, fucking cheater.

Speaker 4:          01:55:05       He was probably on pdds before all this hate and nonsense and just terrible, terrible fucking shit. I read about him online with God, I'll ever, I'll everyone deals with it. I've actually taken, the only time I ever take stabs and you know, even talking about it, I don't feel great about it, but it's when guys Ms. Wade and other fighters, fighters are doing it. Coaches do it. It's just missing weight. There was always uh, penalties for it. You're going to lose part of your purse and public. You know, finger pointing has always been a part of that penalty. Every other guy on that card has made weight then that's the worst part about their job. And hopefully guys are getting w I think we are getting away from weight cutting a little more as we're getting away from the bodybuilder wrestler. Wait, it's a part of that uh, prototype of fighter and that prototype of fighter is going to be keep getting beaten. Now that we have new answers to him. And I think as that fight or changes that weight cutting is a part of that prototype.

Speaker 3:          01:56:03       Well also you sada and the ivy band, that's a big issue. As soon as they started banning the Ivs, you saw people's body weights lowering because they realized they could make that big crazy 25 pound cut in a couple of days and rehabilitate enough for rehydrate enough rather to be able to fight 24 hours later. You just can't do it. You have to drop your body weight down. You have to

Speaker 4:          01:56:23       at Castro diuretics before you decided to diuretics. We all hear who apparently is doing it, but I talk about fighting all day on TV. I can't address that because just because some three coaches and two fighters are like, everybody knows that guy's doing it. Never failed a test. There's no, there's no evidence. It's just you can't really talk about it. You can make observations around it, but the truth is that in that era, man, if you were fighting Josh Barnett in Japan, like you don't know what somebody else might be on, you don't know what vandelay might be on. You got to go over there. You do. You do what you thought you had to do. You know, if you were fighting in pride after a few years, first call, you got to make us to a doctor because you may not want to do it. It may be harmful for your future in some ways depending, but I dunno what I'm going to pride. Look at the sky so they're all on something. Yeah, I need to fight. I've got to make, you know, you don't go ask the bodybuilder up at the gym. He go ask a doctor.

Speaker 3:          01:57:22       Well, it's interesting too because when you watch guys that were competing in pride and we're looking amazing, and then you see them when they got over to the UFC and they weren't nearly as good, you have to look. You have to think one of two things happen. Either they took so much punishment in pride, but they never really fully recovered, which is absolutely possible. Or they were on some shit. Yup. And so both or both? Yeah. Yeah. Most likely. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:57:43       Most likely. The thing people don't see, somehow they, oh, that guy did steroids and now he's this. That may be true, but the natural reaction is this. Whether that's your hormones, your hormonal expression, you're doing hand motions for people to just listen to it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, and uh, you know, your, your hormone levels will crash. And when they crash, v like, you know, tea, our TV tour and Dad Bod Vitara is not like, you know, in theory, if you had to take trt because you had no or very little testosterone, well now that you're off it, you're going to be dad bod. Vito, when I saw that and it was no one, I was really happy for [inaudible] to not look like a, uh, you know, the incredible Hawk and still win. That said a lot about it. And when he fought Henderson, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:58:31       yeah. But who knows, who knows, you know, that's the problem. Who knows what kind of shenanigans are going on, for sure. You know, especially when you're fighting in Brazil. I hate to say it, but it is, it is true. It's a different thing. You know, I don't know what the future holds as far as testing for performance enhancing drugs, but I've got to imagine that they're closing in to the point where there's almost no wiggle room and these guys getting popped but never got pop before. Like when glazing got popped and everybody's like, wow, who fucking saw that comment guy looks like the incredible hulk. So the biggest weight cutters in the history of the sport, I mean he is the biggest 155 pound fighter I've ever seen in my life. Bigger than anybody. Cause he would weigh one 55 it make weight shredded and then the next day you'd be like, Jesus Christ, he's 200 pounds. He's so God damn big. He was so big. Just swirl, shredded, not an ounce of fat, just gorilla strong and and freakish endurance. He popped hot for EPO. He pop top for something else.

Speaker 4:          01:59:34       Yeah, I forgot. It might've been a diarrhetic too, but then

Speaker 3:          01:59:37       Ramiro, another one. You look at that guy and you go, well just fucking, how's that even human?

Speaker 4:          01:59:42       I love the Usada Guy. When he introduced the concept of the smell test, all that is basically like, come on. That's what that is.

Speaker 3:          01:59:50       Skis on top of the man. He's, he's giving these guys

Speaker 4:          01:59:54       base. Yeah. That's the only way. I mean either, hey, everybody can do whatever, which is probably going to be unsafe in a lot of ways. Yes or well, we're going to kind of test, but you guys work around it. Your work arounds will be an acceptable amount of drug use that we're all going to say we're okay with them. Just,

Speaker 3:          02:00:10       well, it's interesting because the UFC didn't have to do this. Yeah. I know. This is all their own idea. This is not instituted by the Nevada state athletic commission. This is entirely the UFC. UFC. His idea to bring into Wicki and say, look, let's fucking chase this down to the end of the earth. What's, find exactly what the fuck these people are doing and let's clean up the sport and you're seeing much more realistic body's much more realistic performances. You're seeing guys like Eric Silva like change radically. He looked like he used to look like, uh, like uh, yoked up Bruce Lee. Yeah. Right. And then he became like, you know, an athlete. You had a fucking regular athletes.

Speaker 4:          02:00:46       Yeah. I was in saskatoon when he fought and when he went out to do the open workout where like, oh, this guy looks totally different. Totally. You know, it's funny being a fan or a fanatic fan. Uh, people always, there's a lot of that negativity we were talking about. People always want to take us a jab at the UFC or Dana or whenever. Nobody ever wants to point out the good moves, like the really positive moves that they make. And this is one of those, it's a big one that's, you know, um, you, you can't half asset because if you have facet and leave it to the end. Nick Dana used to say, it's not our job. It's the commission's job. The reason they instituted this is like they're just not doing a good enough job. They're not. So

Speaker 3:          02:01:30       it's doing is inexpensive and that's why they would do it. The, the type of blood tests the Usada guys are doing is so much more comprehensive, which was also why it was so maddening when Nick Diaz got in trouble because Nick Diaz, and this is also to Novitsky his credit, Novitsky was one of the ones that say, this is fucking bullshit. This suspension is bullshit. What they're doing is bullshit because the Usada testing showed him under the limit, so he is fine. Yeah. And then they had some other wacky piss test. It's not nearly as as accurate and that's where he tested high. And so they find them $100,000 now it's a, it's, it's went from one 65 down to 100 or something like that. And then they're, they're going to give him a 16 month suspension instead of three years, five years. And they were going to give him five years.

Speaker 3:          02:02:16       Well, they just gave vandelay three years. Yeah, you saw that. Yeah. Yeah. But here, the problem with the vangely thing is they did it just before he's going to fight, fade, or in pride. Now if he goes or in rise in rather, I'm saying, right. I'm horizon probably never die, so he's going to fight or and rise in. So he will have violated his band so that it will essentially keep him out of fighting in the United States forever. I mean, yeah, that's a sneaky thing they did right there. Yeah. A lot of people aren't pointing that out. Like they kept that guy on the shelf. They told him he's banned for life, they fuck with them. They wouldn't give him a hearing. They kept postponing the hearing. Then coincidentally right after the guy gets a big fight, he gets a for, he's, he's gonna fight in August, in, in a rising, and then immediately they hit him with his three year and I think he's only 17 months in the, for the original suspension from the time that where they caught him to today, I think it's only 17 months.

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       I think you're right. If that's the case, that's, you know, that's a year and five months is to, guys still got another year and a half to go, so he can't fight fader. He can't get that payday. Or he can go and say, I'm going to finish my career in Japan. He's Kinda, yeah, he's got, I think he's going to be sad for the fans over here. What was the most sad thing was all those crazy videos he was doing or saying the UFC is disrespecting the athlete and they're paying it and then the UFC is like, all right, well we're going to tell everybody how much money you made and then you found out vendorlink made $9 million and you're like, well yeah, wait, wait, you wait, that's not poverty. Yeah Dude, you made 9 million bucks. Like yeah, and he only won a couple of fights. Yeah, I mean obviously so a fucking legend and one of the all time greats and one of my, if I had to pick like three favorite fighters is in that top three pretty bad. He was so much fun to watch. He was just, when you saw vandelay Roland is risks before those fights in the garage. Looking at that over there, come on. He was chaos man. Which is making what makes the cro cop knock out of him even more impressive is that cro cop showed the difference. Man, this is the difference between a guy's a wild brawler and it new elite striking. Yeah, for sure.

Speaker 4:          02:04:15       Yeah. Uh, yeah. You feel bad for vandelay the uh, that reaction with those videos and you know, he loved being a hero. Yeah. He loved Dad. Like when I talked to him, he loved the people and he loved that people celebrated a big reason that he loved fighting was the audience. And he told me that he loved it. And then somewhere between shale in ejecting some chillness in there and a few other things, suddenly the audience was negative against vandelay for some length of time.

Speaker 3:          02:04:43       It was the ultimate fighter. Yeah. He would just, he acted like an asshole. He acted like a bully and an asshole and it didn't work. Yeah. And chill made him look like a fool. He may look very full verbally and then physically when shale took them down, like, you know, really pretty easily chill made them

Speaker 4:          02:04:58       like an asshole. That's where congress do you are now caught. Has been compared to Emma. I don't think it's not, even though, yeah, I can, the thinking. I don't think it's a similarity, but you can't fuck with guys who are so good at that you will lose. You'll see they're going to affect your performance. You're going to look bad. I thought, am I guy uriah figured out exactly how to tangle with conor Mcgregor. Like he became kind of a friend and he was a part of your writing. Does he's got a jovial. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a very likable looking like it's going to be your Ryan Dominick Cruz. That's crazy. What do you think about that? One of the reasons I wanted to fight and wanted to learn more about fighting, and one of the things that pointed me to start pursuing this was uriah faber.

Speaker 4:          02:05:41       Mark Harmonic, these little guys that fought, you know, I'd like admiring them, want it to be like them. I was older. Um, but, uh, but so I'm a Uriah guy. Um, but when he went to fight Frankie, my breakdown kind of was, this guy's really fucking good at these things and he's gets better at these certain things, but we got to see some kind of innovation out of them. We have to see something else. Uriah wins with drive and determination and he'll win every position he wins by with will and he wins by overwhelming you. He can mentally break you. He can't be stopped. All of that is great, but we need something more technically. We need some new tricks. We need some shit that the other guy doesn't know. He didn't have that against Frankie. I'll say exactly the same thing for dominick Cruz. He must have some new things, some other stuff. Just being the best. Uriah isn't going to win them this fight. I don't think he's got to have some other different answers.

Speaker 3:          02:06:35       Yeah. I wonder what he's doing as far as working on his footwork and working to try to deal with, I mean he has fought him twice. He's the only guy to beat dominic. Yeah. He caught dominic with a guillotine their first fight. And I wonder like what's, I mean having the knowledge of having faced dominic, not just once but twice and especially the second time he knocked him down a couple of times. Yeah, very close fight. Just like Tj was a very close, very close.

Speaker 4:          02:07:00       Um, with uh, with dominic. So we were to talk about this earlier. So somebody says, go, go figure out, here's your guy. Go figure it out. How to beat Dominick Cruz, you have three years. What the fuck do we do that I could, yeah, like it's going to be a big one client

Speaker 3:          02:07:13       factor. Slow those legs down. I'm almost at all costs. I think first of all, you've got two things to consider. One, dominic is most likely not going to knock you out with one punch. Yeah. Okay. So he doesn't have the kind of knockout power that a connor does where you really have to be terribly fearful about closing that distance. So you know, his number one asset is, is movement. Chop those legs, man, chop those legs. I, if I was him, I would, I would go and train with the best Moitai leg kicker I could find. I would, I would seek them out. I would say this is priority number one and maybe even, you know, concentrate on switching stances quite a bit because dominic, we'll switch stances quite a bit. And if your ride get switched to Ansys and throw the power, a back leg kick from the low southpaw position and from Orthodox, you know, that would open up those kicks and, and work on those combinations when dominic is switching work on also going across the top of the thigh, if he's not in the right position to throw the outside leg kick, if you were ordinarily going to incite, throw it like an outside, but go across to take that right step and go across the top of the thigh.

Speaker 4:          02:08:13       Slick stuff. Yeah. Slick stuff. So this is part of my mcgregor breakdown fat. Ah, AH, there's lots of little elements. Uh, but um, so, uh, it was Jeremy Stevens, I was asking him about fighting Max Holloway and he's like, I'm like, you know, these guys who moved, they're long, they're going to be lateral, all this kind of stuff. And he said, we have to keep him in the headlights. Right? So we were a car and our headlights kind of go out on an angle. If we keep them in that lit area of the headlights, that's great, but he doesn't want to be there. He wants to be outside of there. So what are we doing? Small steps. He's making grand movements, but if we keep our headlights lined up and we're working at angles, the way a goalie looks at dealing with something, we make small steps and small adjustments to keep them in the headlights.

Speaker 4:          02:08:57       Then when he goes to flee outside of, they're quite simply the right kick is the barrier that way. And the left kick is the barrier that way. And we kind of shoe horn them into our headlights as best as we can at Faber's. Never really used leg kicks that way, but sure. It's fucked. Sounds like a great idea if we can just keep them in those headlights. And as he goes to flee, that extra weapon of the leg starts to, if our headlights are a certain width, the leg becomes the barrier to keep him in there. That's gotta be a starting point.

Speaker 3:          02:09:24       How crazy it'd be. Faber reunited with Duane Ludwig, but they buried all the bullshit God together. It's so crazy. It wouldn't happen because now that he's with Tj and you know, they've said so much bad shit about each other and I don't think it would, but it is too bad. But he needs someone like that. You know, he needs someone who's going to really tighten up those, those footwork movements in those leg kick movements. But if we saw a totally different Uriah, imagine that he comes out of hands up high and just starts attacking those legs. I mean, that would be,

Speaker 4:          02:09:55       it would be, uh, oh shit. Again, with the memory, who's Sa that, uh, Jorgensen when uriah fought Jorgenson, that was my favorite performance ever. And that's, uh, the Duane Ludwig was cornering him and he did something. We see Tj do a lot, I call it like a shell game or like a cue ball and cups. Like you know, we've got three cups, which one has the ball when, when Tj, uh, the changes this level, obviously that can be a takedown, but it can also from there he comes up with the right upper cut from the same spot. It comes up with the left high kick. He has takedowns, he has so many things and it all centers on that, that position, which is fucking shows how smart Duane is. We have these wrestlers in wrestling, they have this level change spot that's going to be the home to many of our attacks.

Speaker 4:          02:10:40       And uriah did that awesomely against Jorgenson. Now Jorgensen's not dominick Cruz, but he did it so beautifully. The level change became a starting point for like eight different options. Tj tried to use that with crews, but dominick Cruz literally one. When a magician, you're a magician, you're trying to do a trick on me or a comedian trust to tell you a joke. You like a fucking hurt all these jugs or I've seen all these tricks. You see a magician can't do that to another magician. So cruise just wouldn't play with Paul a cup game. He's like, I'll dance around out here. You Chase me around, put your ball and cups on like a little trolley and try to convince me to play it. I'll just kick them off, you know? And so that he's just different like and cruises. So fucking smart. Like he's so brilliant, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:11:21       And that goes right back to that sort of growth mindset. When the guy had fucked up legs, he's like, well I still got to get better. I'll learn more about fighting. I'll learn to explain it better. I'll learn to analyze it better. I'll make myself understand it more. He used, instead of that being, well two years down the tubes, it was like two years, I'm going to gain other skills and other applicable skills. And it made them way better. He's way better cause he had that surgery, you know? Then if he just was in the gym and he never was forced to take that time.

Speaker 3:          02:11:51       Yeah, I bet you're probably right. And he's one of my favorite analysts breaks down fights into, especially when it comes to making mistakes in the striking, you know, leaving yourself open to get hit. He's so good at not getting hit. It's one of the best things. He is so good at explaining how to not get hit or why someone made a mistake in getting hit.

Speaker 4:          02:12:12       Yeah. Oh, he's, he's so brilliant. I love, it's funny too. It's like I've, I've met him like once I, when he, it was Tj and him, I was asking him about the fight and I could see him going, okay, let's get kinda knows about fighting because he doesn't give a fuck if you like him. You know what I mean? Dominick Cruz, I like that about him. I liked that about even the way he does analysis or commentary. He doesn't really give a fuck. You asked me to analyze some shit. I'm going to analyze.

Speaker 3:          02:12:37       He's doing it like mathematics. Yeah. Yeah. One plus one is one whether you want, yeah, yeah. Ryan was one is to see, I can't even count with that one. Plus one. One. Yeah. Fuck was saying, he's like, he's putting it together in a really clear, obvious manner. And if it isn't, you don't have to enjoy his personality in order to appreciate the brilliance of what you're saying. Yeah. But I like his personality and I think it's a super smart, articulate guy. We only, we did a little bit of commentary together aside and uh, I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed like being able to bounce ideas off of them and ask questions and I would like to do that with a bunch of different kinds of fighters too because guys who aren't like him, maybe like a Damien Maia, like one of my favorite, um, when Damien Maia Far Neil Magni, uh, I was, I couldn't wait to interview him because I wanted to know like what adjustments he was making when he couldn't tap him from his back.

Speaker 3:          02:13:26       And then he eventually did get it and he was explaining to me how he saw that he was defending on one side. So we started turning them towards the other side and setting them up to defend on that side so he could catch them on the other side. Yes. Oh Man. It's, it's, it's so important. It's, it's everything. It's one of the most important things about mma is analization of technique. And having that fighter explained to you can, it's, it illuminates things in such a beautiful way. Like when I say, well, what did you see that was his, well, when I saw when he kept blocking on this side or he kept moving towards that, so I was going to try to pretend that I was gonna do the same thing I was doing before, but set them up for a difference.

Speaker 4:          02:14:06       And uh, that level of like, his skill level is so incredibly mind. Bogglingly hi. It's so easy for him to think in there. Yeah. Like a lot of guys guys and fight number three. He's like eight. No, and it's UFC fight too. It's like got to get the chuck got to get the shotgun and I got to stop in the chocolate cake. I'll try to get it on. Like it's just the thought processes and as clear and concise as Damien Maia, who's like, all right Jiu Jitsu. I do this every day for my whole life. And you don't

Speaker 3:          02:14:33       interesting about Maya as opposed to anybody else too. He's really adamant about not wanting to hurt people. Yeah. He's like, you know, once I, you know, I got him to the ground, you know, I throw a few punches just to open him up, but I really wanted to get the choke. I don't want to hurt him. I'm like, wow, I don't want to hurt him. Mild. This is like, that is his real mentalities. I'm bullshitting. He's not trying to get you to like him more, but pretending to be more, more kind and peaceful. No, he really is not trying to hurt you. He's trying to, he's just trying to win.

Speaker 4:          02:15:00       Uh, fighting isn't violence like it isn't, it doesn't have to be competition. Yeah. It happens to be violent. Yeah. But it is competition. It's violent. When Rumble Johnson funds, it's fucking fine. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's true, man. He's so that the, the thing about rumble Johnson that doesn't get enough people can't necessarily appreciate is how good he is. Yeah. Like everybody always got power. Yes, he has power, he has crazy power, but he also, when you watch his hips and you watch his feet, he is in position to deliver power anywhere all the time. And that, like when you were trying to figure out, you know how cm punk is gonna fight and I'll talk to people who've never trained or it never studied training or whatever, they're like, well, he could be pretty good. It's like there, I can tell you exactly how good you can be at this stage because if you look at the very best people you've ever watched train with the best coaches at 18 months, this is maybe what they're capable of and he's 36 or whatever and he's not a super athlete, so it'll be a little less than that.

Speaker 4:          02:16:03       He's fucked, he's fucked, he's fucked. And he made a big, I feel like I feel for him because I looked at that when he started doing that, I was like, I know exactly how we feel. I want it to fight. I want it to figure it out. I want it to get in there. But there's that thing. Um, unconscious incompetence, right? Yeah. Unconscious incompetence. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about and you don't even know that. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. And if you learn enough, eventually you get incompetence where you're like, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but at least I know that so I can start learning some shit. Right. Then you'll get conscious competence where you're like, yeah, I'm pretty good. I got to think about it a consciously I'm working at it, but I mean, and then the greats are unconscious competence.

Speaker 4:          02:16:45       Yeah. I don't have to think Damien Maia doesn't have to fucking think about it the most that this, he was unconsciously incompetent when he said he wanted to fight in the UFC. And I feel for him, like I feel the guy didn't know what he was doing. It sounded like a cool thing. He's a driven guy who believes you can achieve what you put your mind to and you work really hard. He just was unconsciously incompetent. He didn't have enough knowledge to know how much could be acquired, what he might be capable of if he worked harder than anyone I've ever worked in his life for 18 months. He didn't understand how low that would be. You know, still suck. You suck.

Speaker 3:          02:17:19       No background in combat sports at all and you're 36 years old and you think you're going to fight in the UFC and a year. That's almost insulting.

Speaker 4:          02:17:26       Yeah. Yeah, and Kudos to him for giving it a shot. I understand the motivation, but I got mocked and ridiculed and fucking ended up with a concussion when I did it on the smallest levels. People who are in fighting, who the fuck is this guy to come into fighting? So I feel for him that way. I know he probably really loves fighting. He just didn't know how shitty was the maximum he could get at this stage. And that level of shininess is not good enough to ever fight in the UFC. Nevermind debut in the US.

Speaker 3:          02:17:56       It's also, I don't think he's that much of an athlete. No. Like when I watch him move I watches, but there's nothing about him where I go like, well, okay, we're watching like a brock lesnar. Brock Lesnar was up fucking freak athlete. You would watch that guy who went out there. I remember the first time I saw barack fight, I saw him fight. I mean I obviously had seen some videos of him and wwe doing some spectacular shit. He's a physical specimen beyond compare. Right. But when I saw him fight in k one, I was in uh, La when they fought and uh, he took, fought some Japanese gentlemen, took them down, just smashed him. I remember thinking, good luck keeping that motherfucker off. That's a totally different kind of a thing with this cm punk guy. What you guys a good looking guy who speaks well, he's got a lot of charisma and that led him to the top in wrestling, but if you watch his wrestling moves like there's nothing because nothing ridiculous about it. You look at his body has nothing ridiculous about his body. He's not doing anything out of the ordinary.

Speaker 4:          02:18:56       He just didn't understand how lo, how little it could be a knowledge and skill could be acquired in the time that he was going to look at. He just couldn't know that. Now if you see him training, I've seen a bit of it, you know like it's looks where you'd think a guy who worked really hard for a year and a half would be, which is okay if you're just watch some of it. Yeah, I mean see if you can find cm punk training. Yeah. What's that? I'd be looking right now. They had this no videos for me anytime recently. There's like some stuff I'm looking at from August. Let's try that. I brought him up when I was talking about Anthony Johnson is one of the first things that you find when you go and uh, let's see what we got here. I'll tell you that. Uh, what you find is that you can do these things, but as soon as the guy is moving, you're not in balance anymore. Right. As soon as you're in reality, you're not imbalanced. I mean the athleticism stuff here, this is not cm punk. Oh cm punk train exos performance center. Okay. I mean that's a guy working out, you know, it doesn't show too much. Yeah, that's it. I saw him hitting pads at one point. I looked like this. Like this is jumping up on these boxes.

Speaker 3:          02:20:05       Yeah. I mean I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:20:07       I just, it's, it's not a knock against him. No, he just didn't know he was unconsciously.

Speaker 3:          02:20:13       What's the main chief? It's like we were talking, it's mathematics. It's similar. Okay. Here we see his golf. First of all, look at this. Yeah, he's a fucking white belts. Yeah, this is crazy. And he's doing this with Hender Gracie. Okay. So as I'm sure doing some plank cause all workouts, old goodwill, okay. But even that, I mean, two years, the reality is, unless you're 20 years old, two years is not really a lot of time to get prepared for something. You've, you're a 20 year old guy, you can watch someone as a blue belt at 20 years and then in two years there a black belt that is possible if you're obsessed, if you're a fucking maniac, if you're a real nut, if you're some Bj Penn when he was in his prime. But you know, this guy probably likes pussy, likes to eat, he's got bills, got taxes, he pays, he's probably got media obligations.

Speaker 3:          02:21:00       Know you ain't ain't that easy to become a complete fucking obsessed freak. And then again, the whole thing is like athletically, his body did not develop to explode. I have a good buddy of mine who's very good at Jujitsu and I brought him to a boxing gym once. And uh, the, uh, the guy was holding pads for him and I was like, oh my God. Like watching him hit pads. I was like, fucking craill male. He's never going to get it. It's like his body did not grow, exploding like that. Yeah. His body moved slow and it was labored. It was like me trying to write a fucking book with my left hand. It was like awkward and he just couldn't do it. And I remember thinking like, wow, okay. Like these, there's just, they're just not there. Is this him?

Speaker 4:          02:21:47       Yeah. I mean that you can tell us a white belt who is trained a bit, you know, it's not too bad. That's all right. Well, but, uh, even the white belt for life thing, that, that smells of being, trying not to be, you know, us as he's a white belt for life. He, you, it, it, it reeks of not being judged and fighting is not a place you want to not be jealous. You're not bad. Not Bad. This movement is not bad, but he's training with Henry Gracie, by the way, who's just a fucking wizard and an awesome instructor. Okay. That's bullshit. And it was space as he pushed that off too. Yeah. But you know, it's, hey man, if this guy was still wrestling and he loved fighting, was talking about, was fighting on a small scale but to stuff a lot and he had a great fight. It was a really good fight for a guy who's only been training for a while

Speaker 3:          02:22:37       and that's the way to do it. Yeah. That's the way to do it. Find somebody who's like at your level. The other thing that's really bummed me out is that he just got it back surgery and back surgery. His fucking trickiest shit, man. They start chewing away at those discs. There's other ways to handle that. I don't know how bad it was, but the guy was walking around and Matt Brown had a good conversation about that recently. I was reading some of the things that Matt Brown said about his own bulging discs because he didn't have to get surgery. He rehabilitated it, but he does a lot of work down at Westside barbell with Louie Simmons who created the reverse hyper a machine that we have in the back here. And I bought, I bought one specifically because I knew that Louis had designed it because they were trying to get him to have back surgery and he wasn't buying it and he was like, there's gotta be a way, if there was a way to compress the disc to make it bulge out like that, there's gotta be a way to decompress the disk actively and strengthen the area.

Speaker 3:          02:23:29       So He created that reverse hyper machine and you know, to see this guy go straight to back surgery like that when just a few days before that he was standing there talking to that Micky Gall kid and Areola. Yeah. I mean what the fuck is going on man? How are you getting surgery? You reviewed all the options.

Speaker 4:          02:23:45       Well that, and uh, you know what he was saying to area, I want to fight on either one 99 or 200 I hope I got the juice to find out 200 which is crazy. You don't, you shouldn't have any juice regardless of our famous your juice meaning yeah, I guess I dunno, but I are you lying to Ariel then cause you knew you were having back surgery or you're lying now that it was weeks before you saw this guy fight. But regardless, I want to pick on the guy because I understand his motivation, but I think if somebody asks my opinion if his, he was my friend and he said, why do you think I should do? I'd be like, why don't you come out and have a long interest in conversation with somebody. Somebody know Ariel's his friend and say, listen, I went and I explored this for a long time.

Speaker 4:          02:24:25       I found, I found some incredible things in fighting. It gave me this, I learned this stuff and what I discovered was there's no way I could fight. That's crazy. It would have been an insult to fighting and I learned enough to know it and now that I love it, I want to work for the UFC. I want to do some other things. I want to contribute. People would look and go honesty, right. That's one of those things we never see. It's so refreshing. Just come out and say, I s I trained my ass off, but what I found was only a further appreciation for fucking everybody in this gym and all these fighters and I learned enough to barely to understand that I barely know anything about fighting, but now that I love it, I want to do some other stuff and fighting, we'd all probably go, cool, that's great. That's what he should do.

Speaker 3:          02:25:03       I don't think he can't fight. I think he definitely could fight. I don't think that a year is nearly enough time to fight in the UFC. I think that's preposterous, but I think anybody could fight at a commensurate level of, you could find someone who is at your level has been training as well as long as you have and have an amateur fight. There's absolutely nothing wrong with not

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       being the best in the world are not being at a world championship or a world class, UFC level. There's nothing wrong with that. No, no. Nothing at all. When insults a lot of peoples that he jumped right into the UFC and he did so because, not just because like he's notoriety, he has notoriety and when he was younger, he was a boxing champion or a wrestling champion. Like brock was NCAA national champion. I mean, you got to look at brock and go, hey man, you know, maybe the guy can actually do it. Him, you're like, you never wrestled in high school. You never wrestled in college. You, you're a white belt in Jujitsu. You're a white belt in. Like, what are you in karate? What do you and [inaudible] and, and to not strike until you sign a contract. That to me is insane. You're having a conversation about maybe fighting in the UFC in two years.

Speaker 1:          02:26:10       You start training yesterday. You don't wait. And then figuring out what gene de Juan a trading striking, that's insanity. Know went to the right place. Yeah. Duke's amazing and such a wonderful, this is the shit. I mean that Jim is amazing. He's got fantastic training there from Daniel won delay to uh, ben asked Fran to pedis to duke himself who's just amazing, coached Kush Scott Cushman and he's got a great gym. I mean, did that, if I was thinking about fighting, that would be one of the places that I would consider. Yeah, he did the same thing that Tristar for Rasa, hobby alliance. Um, matt human just got mad at him right on. He's a fucking genius man. He's got damn jeans and he's the most low key of all of them. You don't hear a peep out of that guy. Timmy. Tris and him are like symbiotic. Like Demetrius is Matt Hume's cruise around the world, knows everything about fighting for himself.

Speaker 1:          02:27:04       Research study, loved the martial arts, pursuing it, looking for all the truths of martial arts. And along comes this super athlete and he's like, I'm going to invest a couple of years, see if he really, oh shit. He's really becoming his, he learns incredibly well. He's a good guy. He's a smart person. Oh Shit. Then once he gets to that level, it's just like I'm going to commit my life to making you the champion and symbiotically Matt trains for them, physically transferred them like he's his training partner most of the time and he's a fucking genius. That symbiotic one on one thing. There isn't much of that in the in the world. There's not many fighters that have one brilliant coach that commits most of their time. It's hard to find someone who's willing to do that, who and then forget about someone who has the knowledge and the ability that hume has.

Speaker 1:          02:27:47       Cause he's not just a knowledgeable guy, but he's very similar and for us as a hobby and that he's not just incredibly knowledgeable, but he's also incredibly physically capable of like for Ross is fucking nasty. He's got nasty kickboxing skills and nasty Jujitsu. I mean, and his knowledge is very deep and wide and I think the same thing can be said of Matt Hume. It's so rare to find a guy like those two guys I admire for us and I liked him very much and I just spoke with him the other day. On the phone before I went in to do the Mcgregor won. He was working on something with like, I go and I love the man, he's brilliant, but the,

Speaker 4:          02:28:21       the one differences, he's got 50 students so he, and he makes them great and he gives them real time and he dedicates himself to them. But this guy is basically one of a handful and that is crazy. But for us also seems to be that it's such an interesting, martial arts seems to have this interesting path where you know, you come along and you learn some moves and then you've learned how kind of, how it works and then you do work on your body and then you learn how to learn and then you learn strategy and then all these things growing. Inevitably you end up at a mental thing. And then philosophy, the study of martial arts ends up somewhere, the study of philosophy, how to live your life, how to learn, how to improve, how to become better in being a human being, not just in kickboxing. Like that inevitable result. If you stay on the martial arts path long enough, inevitably you end up, how can I be a better person? Like how can I get better at being a human being and frost was there

Speaker 3:          02:29:15       that those things are part of what trips people up. You know, part of what trips you up in anything you do is if you have personality flaws, if you create problems in relationships and in interrelationship conflict, um, problems with friends, problem with a wife or girlfriend or what have you, those, those things that make you a bad neighbor will also make you a bad fighter because they get in your way and you realize you've created this unnecessary Chi u, you know, yelled at your fucking neighbor for no reason because it's dog shit in your lawn or whatever the fuck it is. Like you, you created a problem that didn't need to be there and now you've got, you've got extra friction and conflict in your life that's unnecessary instead of creating some sort of a positive bond by being a really good person. So you learn, you know, again, no one's perfect but you learn somewhere along those lines.

Speaker 3:          02:30:06       Okay. I if I just approached this in a better, more, yeah, more friendly, more open, more nice. And then I get this positive reward out of that. And then I realized that's the path. The Path is to try to be a better person. The Path is to try to have more character. The Path has tried to be a better friend to be a, you know, a, a better training partner. You know, to make sure that you are pushing your friend towards victory. You're not trying to kick his ass cause you know he's tired. You know that that's a real issue in Jim's right when they'd run a gauntlet, having a guy that is going to wear you out, but it's not going to fuck you up because he knows he can because he knows you're tired because you just ran with three other guys. One thing you should drive me crazy where I would be training and I would be exhausted and I would just see a guy sitting down waiting, taking the time off of training, not training that round. And then as soon as this round is done, he tries to jump on you. You just sitting down. Why were you just sitting down? And I'll call them out. I'd go, what are you doing? You want to rest? And then you want to jump in while you're fresh and other people are tired. Fuck off man.

Speaker 4:          02:31:13       For sure. Yeah. I remember sparring with a guy and after I looked he was wearing like novelty boxing gloves. Like everybody showed up to spine. He had a little like, and it's like, are you out of your fucking mind? Like you're looking for an edge over people you're working with. You know, it's so strange. But uh, those guys are almost always not good. Yeah. But sometimes good enough to hurt you. Yeah. There's this guy that I used to, I love working with. I just really like, there's a lot of the guys in Canada that kind of end up being like, ah, I kind of get to admire them over time because they were pioneers and maybe some of them weren't even in the UFC, some of them got their Claude Patrick, Sean Pearson, some of those guys who were important, Canadian pioneers, harmonic and, and Pat [inaudible], all those guys.

Speaker 4:          02:31:56       Joe Dirksen who was a quilt. You admire those guys. One of them, he never got to the UFC and he's in his probably close to 40 now. Adrian wooly, and he was like the best one 25 are going. And when I would go and I had a fight coming up, I wanted some rounds with Willie and the reason I wanted them was one, he would push you really hard, but two, he hurt me one time and he's very aggressive and he hurt me one time and my leg wobbled and the, as I circled, I saw him take the time to let me recover. And that's literally the perfect training partner. You want him to push you so hard as close to a fight as you can handle right now and understand what you can handle but not take you past that point. And what, yeah, and he was literally, and he was ornery and aggressive, but I loved having him in the rotation in the last week of your four or five or a couple of weeks of real training before a fight.

Speaker 4:          02:32:45       Not because of that. There's just like training, training partners. Some gyms have, Tristar has some guys they don't fight, but man, they're a huge important ingredient to every one of those fighters. You know, you were talking about you're getting that concussion and Jordan means what happened with me and he just retired a really young, yeah. You know his dad just fought recently. His Dad's like 45 just enormous and one and his dad is a cool dude. I don't know exactly. We talked to Jordan after, he's like 20 feet. Yeah, he's got like 30 plus fights. He's fucking, you super talented. You see what he did to my pile, you know what I mean? My piles, beryllium, my piles are super fighter. Tiago Alba's for he took that body kill. Yeah. Props to Tiago, figuring a way through that first round and landing that body kick and taking your out.

Speaker 4:          02:33:36       But then for have me in retirement, that was really shocking. My, I'm guessing so what I'm going to say is into, I know Jordan, I like Jordan very, very much. His father and I are very good friends. Uh, I'm guessing, but there I picked up bits and pieces of him kind of figuring out, well, I'll get paid real good money when I'm kind of at the top. And then it's like, wait a second, I'm fighting like top five guys. I'm finding like Tiago El Vez level guys, I'm there. Jordan wants to be rich and Jordan wants to be successful in life in some of those ways. And at least he's told me that. And he didn't say anything about pay or any of that stuff, but it was like he was, he's right the top and he's not becoming wealthy enough for what he's doing. That's my guests.

Speaker 4:          02:34:22       Uh, and uh, he loves fighting, but one day he loved other stuff too. He's like, you know what, I didn't again, I'm guessing, but a guy like him was like, you know, I didn't have as much sex in high school is a lot of other guys did because I was training all the time. You know, I didn't go on fishing trips as much as other guys because I was training all the time. You know, drinking beer on Saturdays is really fun. Like all of those things happen. You're 25, you're like, you know, and man, having the guts, the smartness to identify and the guts to quit something. We all as a society think that like, don't quit anything you driven. You do go do it for life. To really analytically look and go, this will not give me what I want. Even if I achieve the results I will achieve.

Speaker 4:          02:35:03       I don't want or are not enough for me. So I will step away. I admire that like fucking, um, uh, rock bands and I'm trying to think of somebody in particular aerosmith or someone like that. The fuck is this guy still doing? Going up there playing it might love it, but why is he on American idol? He needs to still be on tv or he needs an audience or needs to be worshiped or whatever. You made all the money. It made all the great records. Go and sit on a beach somewhere. People who go, you know, I've done enough of this stuff. I think I would move on to other stuff. We should admire those people cause they're really rare.

Speaker 3:          02:35:35       You know, they are. They are really rare. This is me and was so salad to guide, you know, uh, another guy like that, that vantage has Adlon Amaa Golf. Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. I don't know what happened. He became very religious and I heard that he was going to be a, I'd heard some rumors that he was going to be a cleric or something like that. Wow. He was a pretty devout Muslim. I don't know what happened, but he was another guy and be like, wow, that guy was so talented.

Speaker 4:          02:36:03       I used to manage some UFC fighters a couple all the way up. So that was, it was really to learn everything I could do to learn any angle off fight or manager, if I could carry the bucket, whatever I could do, I want it to. And I came across this guy, nick dinny. Do you ever remember him? Yeah, sure. Yeah. And I'm a managed nick can we got him to the UFC? Who is she? We got sean shelby. A fucking loved nick. And you should, if you go and watch his first fight or as fights in the UFC, he fought like a caveman. The guy has a master's degree in biochemistry. I think he's brilliant. But when he fought, he loved fighting like a caveman and he retired because he said he is taking head trauma. It didn't like it. Yeah. And He uh, he, we talked about it and he talked with other people about it.

Speaker 4:          02:36:45       It's like, could I fight different ways? Yes. But he likes fighting like a caveman and fighting like a caveman will result in brain damage. He got knocked out by Marlon Sandra and pack a in a single queue. And then he said, after he recovered from that, when he said, you know, if I ever get another concussion, I'm going to retire. And then after that, uh, the last fight he had, he had a broken orbital bone and he thought, why am I waiting until after I've sustained the damage to step away? Why am I giving, saying it's okay to take one more large amount of damage if I'm going to step away and let's just go, let's step away. You know, um, he's a brilliant guy, one of the most interesting or cool guy. I haven't talked to him in a while. I'm gonna make sure that I to send a, give him a call or something. He's such a brilliant guy,

Speaker 3:          02:37:28       very, very smart guy. And he's a guy who was using an example of someone who's very wise and recognizing the risk versus reward and realizing the rewards not worth it anymore. I need to. Yup. And there's gonna come a time for all these guys. They have to decide like, when is it over, you know, when we were talking about the pursuit, like getting after something and being obsessed with something and wanting greatness. There comes a time when that's no longer in your mind and you're still on this path because it's something you've always done because you've been a fighter for x amount of years. And so this is what you're doing. You're going into training camp, but you don't have that fire inside you like you did when you first started or when you were improving or when you were at your best and that's what you need to stop.

Speaker 4:          02:38:12       Yeah. The, uh, so hard for people. It's really hot at the, one of the things I've heard before as people will allow Paul, Pauline Polyman, the nausea, I had never pronounced in there as well, who is actually a brilliant commentator. Very, very fucking love listening to his car. He's one of my favorites in box of area. Um, he, uh, wrote an article about how his passion and desire to get back to fighting and everyone told him he shouldn't, but it's just enemy needs that that cannot be the motivating factor among the reasons that it, that's 100% true. It can't be is cause when you're 60, you're still going to have that. That's never going to go away. So that just having that does not mean go fight cause you'll always have that

Speaker 3:          02:38:53       many pieces of a pie chart that you have to have in place.

Speaker 4:          02:38:56       Yes. But if you're going to have it your whole life, it's irrelevant whether you have it or not. Cause you know you'll have it and one day you're going to have to retire even though you have it. So that can't be a part of the decision

Speaker 3:          02:39:05       process. Thank you. Probably didn't see that rocky movie when a rocky was like 59 and he decided, you know, just the, the movie I'm gonna Fight. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. That was the one where, um, he was uh, who the fuck did he, yeah, I Tommy Gun. No, no, no, no. It was after that I, yeah, it was it the one where he fought the guy who knocked out Roy Jones Jr. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tarver magic man. And uh, you know, which was fucking ridiculous and apparently got knocked out and training. Yeah. Training for that at like 60, whatever the hell he was getting punched in the face. Mark Tarver

Speaker 4:          02:39:41       when were uh, yeah, insane. When we're looking at Anderson Silva fighting, he has one of his very favorite fighters is Roy Jones Jr and there it is. Look at that. Come on son. What the fuck are we looking at? That's insane. It's like 70 years old and he looks 30

Speaker 3:          02:39:58       like, yeah, I mean it's amazing what testosterone replacement therapy is done for them, but like, um, it's just the, the fact that he could try to sell this, just look at him. He shredded incredible. How old was he when he made us in his fifties?

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       I least? Thousand six so 10 years ago. The least. How old is he now? I'm not sure. Let's find out how old he is now, because that would mean that he had to be like 57 then. I think if it's 67 next day, nine now. Oh my God, that's insane. Science, man. That's science. Jesus Christ. I love this. This is so insane. Yeah. Let's try to say he's five [inaudible] six I'm five eight I stood next to that dude and maybe had lifts in his shoes, but he's, he's taller than me. Yeah. Everybody was to just pretend he's so tiny. That's some weird, weird thing that people do. You know? They always like try to pretend that people are tinier than they are. Like three feet tall. I am five eight I don't wear lifts in my shoes. I never have. I have terrible posture. I'm short as fuck stood next to him.

Speaker 1:          02:41:02       He's bigger than I expected him to be. What everybody says, I want to meet Tom Cruise because everybody says these tiny too. He might not be tiny. I don't know why that would be something that people do, but whatever where it's perceived as undermining people just to love that people love doing that. They love doing that. You realize you don't have to do that. Like when you see people, you know Ronda comes out and says that she had a horrific experience and be like, yeah, fuck her. And then when you're like, why are you reacting this way? They're like, well she brought it on herself. But yeah, but you're still choosing to have that response. You could easily have a different response who could easily have a different perspective. But that's a long path to improvement for an asshole. You're like trying to improve a troll with one sentence that's like not going to happen.

Speaker 1:          02:41:49       People also, their, their life sucks and they see someone who's doing as good as she was doing when she was on the top. I mean, was it sports illustrated call to the most dominant female athlete of all time and you know, there's just so much hype and fanfare. And then also there's all the shitty things that she was saying to her opponents and the way she was talking to them and they'll like the Misha tate thing, which he did the show with her and she was, and she would win the competitions. You'd be like, fuck you. And after the she beat her, she walked away. When you shake her hand, there was so much fuel for the haters, but it's so much. Feels like you don't have a choice but must hate like you do have of course, of course. I just feel like sometimes when we say these things, and I do it all the time, I'm guilty of it as charged, but we're, it's almost like you're yelling out into the abyss.

Speaker 1:          02:42:36       I guess. I just, it all you can do is hope that you keep offering up. That there is another choice, but we're also a binary culture. There was this article, I read the Tinder Ization of America. We're here, they've got a swipe. Yes. Yup. Wanna fucker left. Nope. Don't. And that that thought process, that binary process has actually influenced how our culture, thanks Rhonda Rousey, uh, is either the greatest athlete ever or she fucking sucks and she's terrible. She can lose and still be the greatest athlete ever. She can still be a 99 out of a hundred, but we can't have that in our culture. She's a left swipe or a right swipe and people only want one or the other. They won't. There's gray areas in everything in the world and the gray areas where the beauty is, it's where the interesting, fascinating shit is and where our culture is making it so that we don't look there.

Speaker 1:          02:43:27       Because of that swipe though is why a real winner like conor is so spectacular because with the amount of scrutiny with the amount of pressure that's on them to still perform the way he did and when in 13 seconds by knockout, then you are the hero. And then that's also why people were shitting on. Although after the fight so badly, right. Although it was the greatest pound for pound, now he's terrible. No, he's still among the greatest, he had a life, he had a decade of being the greatest. Maybe he's now been surpassed by somebody or had a long career, a lot of damage. Todd or damage. Quite a lot of hard fights but plus the gym wars. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you talk about how they trained back then. He used to live in the gym, probably train all day, every day plus barn with any sour on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          02:44:15       I mean sours like an all time k one. Great. By the way, that was Carlos condit first kickbox yeah, I saw that. Yeah, I saw that. He's got zero fights. He falling out with a hundred fights. Unbelievable. I love to, I, I watched uh, much of that podcast that you did with them and I mean I'm, he is, you were saying vandelay would be one of your three favorites are at that those things do change every time we would talk, we would have diff once thinking differently, but kindness is absolutely one of my absolutely tough guy. That fifth round with lawler was just insane. I thought he won that fight. It was a very close, very close fight. Very close fight. Yeah. That one. Uh, yeah. I mean what I thought was beautiful, it didn't really fucking matter to him. Like he was searched, he was seeking that fight and he had that fight.

Speaker 1:          02:45:02       And what three guys sitting at the side think it doesn't take anything away from the 25 minute brilliant experience that he had that will affect him positively for the rest of his life. You know? And what do you like to do it again? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe that was, you know, I dunno man. I still only got a few more left in him I think. Yeah, no, I think Carlos is a really smart guy and I think he's also got a lot of other things that he could do with his life. He's very intelligent and what made him such a great fighter would make him great at anything he chooses to do. And I think he's got a realistic perception of how much longer his body can go through those kinds of training camps and those kinds of fights. Yeah, I mean the sour, what's this first?

Speaker 1:          02:45:42       She's saying that's the same. I loved it. Yeah, I know. I saw that. He said, you know, it was such great experience for him. Um, he, uh, he gave me one of the great quotes when I was trying to figure out more about fighting it and it was actually relevant to what we're saying about dominick Cruz and you're talking about, we showed the footwork drills and how he moves and I asked conduct because he's like that and he's very special, you know. And I said, uh, when you're doing that, are you, when you go into fight, are you working with pre planned sequences? So you'll

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       run sequence a twice or three times on Robbie and when he starts reacting to sequence a or tricking with sequence b, are you running these things? Are you improvising? What's happening? And the way he put it was brilliant. He said, some of the time I'm reading the sheet music and I'm just reading the sheet music and playing it. And other times I just go off on a solo and I just yet, and I just improvise. And that and Stephen Thompson, Mcgregor crews, holly, that's what the best are doing there. They have sheet music. Sometimes some nights the sheet music is going to be killer. Everybody's going to apply it, it's going to be fantastic. Other Times you got to go off on some crazy jazz odyssey to make it work. And sometimes they're a bit of both. Well that was a big thing with Anderson, this recognizing where those patterns were and being able to create something in the moment.

Speaker 4:          02:46:53       Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about Anderson versus bisping? Um, like I was saying, Roy Jones Jr was one of his favorites and you saw what happened to Roy Johnson when he got all. Certainly it will happen eventually. Is it now or is it in a year or is it in five years? It's gonna happen. Uh, I'm, I mean I, I have, I played a troll game with Anderson Silva it and not with him, but sure. Dog used to ask for, for predictions and I just picked against Anderson on everyone because everybody was picking at us. I thought it was funny, right? I mean, Stephan Bonner is going to defeat Anderson Silva and be considered the greatest it was, it was comedy, right? So people, friends who know me or people who follow our channel, no, that, uh, so when I say I think bisping's going to when they think I'm just still playing that.

Speaker 4:          02:47:37       But I do probably think that Andrew, when we picked her Anderson Silva, we're picturing him in there against forest in the greatest moments. And that's not what I expect him to be. I don't expect him to be like that anymore. The fact that he was one of the greatest fighters of all time, it brilliant and beautiful to watch and did incredible things. That's not diminished in any way. What's fucked up is that wasn't that long ago. What's really crazy about him was stephan bonner was like, what was that, 2013 yeah, 12 or 13. 13. So four years ago he was the wizard. He was the greatest of all time. Now he's barely hanging on. It took a whole year off. He fought Weidman, broke his leg and a half, took a whole year off. Um, we will also broke his leg and then tested positive after the Diaz fight took that year off.

Speaker 4:          02:48:25       Exactly. So He's, you know, he's in some weird place right now. We don't know what his body's going to be like. We don't know. We me know bisping's accusing him to taking steroids his whole career. That could be partly games and shit for he might know something. I don't know. Uh, all of those things hint to me, point towards not expecting him to be as best if he's not as best. Michael Bisping is the most underappreciated, underrated and undervalued by his opponents. Tough, fundamentally really good. He's not going anywhere. He's got hard because smart punches, not knockout punches, but enough to make you aware. Everything he does is intelligent, well placed. He can get emotional and that might be something Andrew Anderson will want to play with. But, uh, but I mean, I just

Speaker 1:          02:49:07       don't, I'm not imagining Anderson Silva from his highlight reels. I'm imagining a guy who had his leg broken and half lost twice, 100% of the fights he's had since then, which was the diaz fights. He didn't have. Brilliant performances, so we haven't seen him have really a brilliant performance since you Shan Okami years back now. Could he come out and be mind blowing? That'd be amazing. Yeah. Well Boehner was his last year before. I guess I'm kind of undervalue shoe was a spectacular tentacular so yeah, and he had many of them and yeah, and just cause I played picked against them for a comedy. I don't want my friends of ours where people watch fighting were to think I don't like Addison. So he's 40 yeah, exactly.
