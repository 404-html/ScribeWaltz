Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Shit out of me, dude. Did you change the right now? Yeah. Yes, I did. Beautiful. Fly Me to the moon. Don't. Don't show me. That's all I can say this without much. Probably they'll probably get you just for the tone just to you. I bet you go, Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh. They own that docs, those fucks. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. Someday. We're going to have Sam Harris on the podcast. I had lunch with him today. Famous neurosurgeon, prominent atheist, author, genius. Extraordinary. And on that day the fleshlight. I'm going to tell you what we won't be talking about Ya. He's responsible, he's sensitive and rightly so. You know, if people found his shit online and they went and researched that and we talked for the first 20 minutes about the fleshlight is credit him somewhere not sex. Sex Talk. No, but sex toy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Maybe. What if we disguise it? Like we just talked about what we are dealing with. The flashlight was back when we only had one podcast a week and you know, now we do often three podcasts a week and we still talk about the flashlight. You know, we'd never tried to charge them more money ever. I think if they skip a podcast, they're just going to have to deal with that shit sometimes you have to. If it were, what were huge. I'm a huge supporter of the freshlime. I, I really wish Sam could just sit here and we could talk about it like two intelligent people, you know. Is it fucking up? These things suck, man. We've got to get limp Dick. Look at it. It's all floppy, floppy. I got it. Got It. Yeah. Talk right into that bitch. Anyway. Flashlights have solid products. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Everybody knows what it is that, you know the commercial. You know the deal. I kind of am. Brian pointed this out to me yesterday. It's kind of freaking me out the other day. I really. It is the same thing. I am saying the same thing. So even though I'm trying not to say the same thing, I'm still saying the same thing because ultimately I have to say that to get discount you'd go to Joe Rogan.net and you click on the link and you enter in the code name. Rogan. Yeah. All the other things I can just record. It will not be a bad idea. But people like this, for whatever reason, they like the fact that we would like this better. It's better I think really talking. I think it's just the certain parts where you know, like when you, especially when you're talking about on it and you're like, you know, steal the own products.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       I really, really. I know they know that, but just people that are listening to this for the first time, I know it sounds crazy to everybody else has been on board from the beginning. We love you. We appreciate you very much. But we can't do a show just for you. We have to do a show. Recognizing the fact that somebody might be tuning into this. You know what I mean? It's like following you. I don't like following shows. Like I could never watch dexter mid season. I'm not going to do it. You lost me because it's all it all done. It falls into each other and I don't know who the fuck that guy is. This girl. Why is she calling him? Well, why? Why am I supposed to care? I liked the whole years. Hold apart, hold together. You're already your a. But you got to watch them in order and you know, someone could be tuning into this fucking show for the first time. I don't want them to have to know a bunch of insights. Shit. You know what my favorite

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       thing is as people are sitting on twitter lately is fleshlight stuffed into their mattresses in their beds and printouts of my face like above it, like on the mattress. So it looks like they're fucking it while looking at my face. That's Kinda hot. Yeah Bro. As long as they're not mean moms when they're done, they don't stab your picture and go fucking crazy. Yeah. I wish it wasn't guys. Maybe they shouldn't. Girls. So their finger and themselves to you. I bet there are just rubbing their to figure demons. Vaginosis and this podcast reaches a lot of human beings. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands. This got to be one girl out there as. Oh, Brian's on. She just fucking get crazy. She's probably one of those girls that clause that or pussy you ever wants to like a porno where a girl, she's clawing at it. You're like, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Are you sure your phone? Brody, brody Stevens. Yeah. I don't like when they clawed at Man, that makes me uncomfortable. You know, like if I was doing that I would feel like I was being way too rough. Roughly screaming you like, Hey, what the fuck, you know? And this girl just took it in her own pussy. I'm like, oh, what's going on there? Is that thing just numb, you know, that's what they say. Um, it is actually some sort of a scientific or nothing? No, no, no. People that, it's like genital piercings and like, especially when they have a lot of them, many of them, they believe it's connected to a disease where they don't feel, uh, feel things the same way. We do, they don't have the same amount of sensory input from pain, so they have to really hurt themselves. Then there's certain people that, you know, there's a broad spectrum of how the human body works and operates and sometimes the wonky thing is that their pain is, it doesn't work.

Speaker 2:          00:04:40       It doesn't work. Right. And they, they want to experience pain so they, they'll pierce themselves, especially if their genitals beside sexual abuse. That's another thing with, with uh, with genital piercing. But it's also because I thought it felt better for them. Did you ever hear that nursing? I've heard it with like girls clips and stuff like that, but I always thought they were just crazy, you know, but there was the video of the guy getting fucked to death by the horse. Mr Hans, that guy has balls are all peer stop. Oh really? Yeah, like, like, like a, like a three ring binder. You watch that video. I've watched some man times. That's to me as you've studied that, the cinematography. Yeah. I could tell if you fucked with it. If it was a brutal felony trying to cut out scenes, I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       That's not what didn't come yet. Some shit out. You cut some shit out the most. Came too quick, but ball is bulging there. You can tell it's still full assessment on it. Dot Com is our other sponsor and I do have to say I'm a. people are getting annoyed with these ads as well, but some people haven't heard of before so I have to say it in a certain amount of order and they want to take a break in the middle. Yeah, yeah. What do you want folks? The fuck you want me to list? You're talking about Dr. remember a radio host? Just go into their spiel. The middle of the grossest pbs. I was assigned to this Terence Mckenna interview and he was on pbs and every fucking five minutes. No bullshit. Every five minutes. This is our fun drive. Our Big Fund drives here if you want to keep conversations going, guilt kids, great conversation we're having right now with Terence Mckenna.

Speaker 2:          00:06:07       Please donate. You can donate by baby blue. We can offer this and you get a cup, you get your fresh air with the in front of tasks, but kind of saying he kept doing it. It was like, I will pay you anything to not have you do that. You're torturing people. Nobody wants to hear that. That's a ridiculous thing. You're making people who are listening to an hour interview, listen to six fucking commercials. You stop it six times. Fuck you. You know I heard it already. What are you doing? You pestering me? You. Who the fuck do you think you're reaching? Are they're the same people to random people. Just start tuning in halfway through this fucking thing. The shaking you down. You asshole with boredom. Cut it out. Go makes you want to kill him. Give me your money. You more delusional content and the only reason why they think they can get away with this because we rely on public funding because they didn't rely on public funding and be like, fuck you man.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       I'm not buying your shit. You're asking me to buy your shit every six minutes. So yeah. Well, I have these commercials probably after a few times out. You'd probably think the same. What happened here, what happened from the 15 minutes or 15 second spots in 30 seconds to like the 10 minute spots. It seems like a jump. One day. Products you don't get ever get to the product. And we have to deal with controversy. Controversy, yeah. This, there's always a, it's not just new products, new products dealing with controversy. Oh, one thing I can tell because of your voices, the discount code, Rogan, there's only good the first time you use it now it's good anytime you use it. So anytime you use a code name, Rogan you get 10 percent off every time. Now that's good. That's better. And um, we have a new whole new product line we're coming out with like hemp protein and shit like that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       And we're going to start selling kettlebells. Kettlebells are expensive. They're expensive as fuck for no reason why you can get like high quality ones made as long as you're selling them online. Like we would do it. Not trying to bring them to stores and shit like that. So we could sell them like same quality, way cheaper than everybody else calls them. You find out a lot of things and you start selling things like how much money people make for shit. One of the things about, about, um, on it and Alpha brand people were like, well, why is it so, you know, why is it so expensive? Do our profit margin compared to most supplements is way lower than the ingredients are very fucking expensive. All the shit that we have in is the best quality available. We're really doing it like the worst way ever to make money because we're saying you get 100 percent money back guarantee if you don't like if you use it, it used to be you could buy up fucking 100 bottles and you wouldn't even have to send them back.

Speaker 2:          00:08:34       We would just give you your money. But too many people were ripping us off. They were selling them on Ebay and shit. So we had to stop doing that. But. But if you order it, you don't like it, you don't have to send it back. Just tell us. I didn't like it. Didn't do anything for me. Even something is strange as a vitamin, you know what I mean? How do you know of a vitamin is doing something for you? Do you really fucking know? I mean, how much time does it take before you're so in tune with your body that you can tell when you have and have not

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       a multivitamin sign? If it's a radioactive vitamins, you can tell Dan, you can tell, but that said, if you take vitamins on a regular basis, you will notice a difference in your overall health. I'm absolutely convinced of that. That is my experience in my life and I've read studies that say otherwise, but I've also seen studies that I know are influenced by bullshit by pharmaceutical companies and they've been trying to license nutraceuticals. They were trying to make it so that vitamins are prescription only for a long time. That's something pharmaceuticals pharmaceutical companies have lobby to try to do. A couple of times we shot down. The pharmaceutical companies would. They would have the rights to sell vitamin C. If you wanted vitamin C, you would have to go get a prescription for it. We're going to have a terrific. You would have to go to doctors to get vitamins, you know, a fucking terrible that would be, and you would have to give you a prescription for all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:42       He wouldn't, you know, I guess unless we had some open, you know, you would have to have things that are approved and then those things that were approved, you would have an open prescription for any extra dietary nutrients. I mean that's. Unless you would have it every time you wanted to get some vitamin D because they can make money off of it and they could keep supplement companies. You know, the I the word right now, who, who gives it just regulating anybody. That's the problem is that they feel like it's, it's not regulated enough. You know, and there's a good point too that there is, there's a very good point to that, but it's way worse than way better rather than overregulation, which is what it would be if you had a prescribed vitamins. Yeah, no, get it. People have figured out what works and what doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       There's a lot of, there's a lot of scientific studies about the efficacy of all sorts of different multivitamins, you know, there's, there's things that point to the fact that they can, you know, certain ones can help you in stress. Be Twelve gives you energy. There's, it's not nonsense. You know, there's, there's a lot of reality and vitamins. These are, you know, what you're doing is you're supplementing the essential parts of food that are healthy for you. It's really that simple. You know, and I have always been a person that as try to, as much as I can eat healthy and when I can't eat healthy, I make sure I'm always taking vitamins. You got to give you. Yeah, I noticed a difference. You got to give your body a chance. You know, when he was doing Jujitsu, he was eating fucking hot dogs and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       No vitamins, no nothing. All Day. Yeah. And he was getting injured all the time. I was like, what are you eating? What are you throwing in your body? So it was like, Yup, Nachos, whatever. See what's around. So for now, uh, if you're interested in nootropics, here's the Spiel, disassociated every week. Google that shit. Don't just buy her stuff. Google it. There's a bunch of different companies out there. I'm sure they're all, there's a bunch of good ones. So you don't need to buy our stuff. If you think our stuff too expensive, there's all you have to do. Buy everything in bulk. The ingredient list is all online and it's, it's listed exactly how much is in each, each different supplements. So take, take the ingredients list, make your own seriously. I'm 100 percent happy if people do that. I don't care if you buy it, you don't like it. You get 100 percent of your money back for the first order. If you keep buying it. And then you say, I didn't look, there's one didn't

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       look this one that I have a feeling that you just fucking crazy. That's it. Don't forget about higher primate. You never talked about that. That's awesome. You, you ever going to have a sale? I feel bad because it's like I'm sponsoring myself. Yeah. But that's, that's actually, you know, a lot of people I think would love so much. Some core t shirts. Well, if you're ancho monkeys and weed and you probably are right, who isn't good to hire-primate.com. That's my tee shirt company. And I've actually been meaning to talk to about this because we've got a whole new um, new supply in A. Yeah. So it's just a weird cartoon monkeys that are getting high monkeys. It's cool. I always, when I got monkeys playing chess with aliens, monkeys doing mushrooms, it's, we got new ones coming out too. I'm gonna have to sign new.

Speaker 2:          00:12:39       Yeah. I'm going to have some new designs about monkeys and mushrooms because I want to get some, a stoned ape theory type illustration or the monkeys were all gathered around a glowing mushroom. I just got to get another guy to draw one up. But how about this? How about a bunch of those monkeys passing liquor? Join around at one good. It has a thought bubble and he's like, Oh, this one monkey dude. He gets a thought of whatever. I don't know. The stoned ape theory was. It's like operator though, like it starts off with like a scribble and then it turns into a banana. It's a good idea though, Jude, a monkey with a balloon in a in a joint line and he's like, Oh shit. I got an idea. Ideas the third, they came up with powerful Ari Shaffir or it could be a crazy idea, so crazy at work. So crazy that started sending up the gun, the fleshlight link and entering the code name. Rogan you get 10 percent off from now and for every order in the flashlight for fleshlight proper eternity. What the times a million hits it. Hit that shit, bitch. Let's start this fucking disaster off the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       Hey, Joe Rogan podcast all day.

Speaker 2:          00:14:02       Yeah. He said that he beat Bj Penn. Oh my god. Isn't that the cOolest thing ever? Yeah. You said that after he beat bj penn or like, oh shit, we got to get a recording of that coming fighters. If you want to have your own joe roGan experience opening, just say it after you win and we'll put you on this ticket. They're goIng to give you some. Give you some propers, so silver. Oh, she had water pipes.com. Santa. The coolest boss ever. It's bad. tied tack one. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah, you know what it is? It's exactly like dyson for bongs, like even their website, like if you go to their website, it's just like a dyson website. It's so nicely crafted in India. You don't have to like pull up the card for it to, you know, take a hit. You just push down this little thing and it opens up the carb for you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       So it's, it's just, it's an awesome bong I've used many, many times before, but that one is just tight. I want to get rid of really bad. They took it to the next level. They did. They had to clear out that bowl. You just, you pull down a little, a little stem has like a little lever on it and then you can pop it out of the bowl. The bowl just wash it out and it won't break either. It's super delicate. Shit. Broke the bond in this. Of the ice house. Oh no. Really knocked it over to my core. Like a retard. Yeah, and bong. Water smells wrong. Water had peed on it. There's no way you're cleaning that out every day. You got to get some of that stuff that you can get at petco for when your cat piss. That's so funny. You said that you used that.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       You have ever kept the pictures in your house? Yeah, we talked about a couple of weeks ago. Piss all over mY fucking bed couch. I just found out. What's that? What's that about? Like he's trying to tell you something like you're a punk. You know? I saw it. Had a urinary infection of some kind and that's what it was from because now she's not doing it, but use that as an excuse. I think they just like pissing on you. Yeah, I think so. Mad. Yeah. Urinary tract infection doesn't make them pee in one specific spot. They just bothers them. They blame the eu when they put like a Bird on your pillow. That's them trying to give you a gift card. Your front doorstep. They're presenting that to, you know, they like you. My other theory is that my dog has been at my house for the last couple of weeks and so the dog, when it's usually in town, just like, starts like chasing the cat and like it's so I think because now the dog's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       The cats like, oh yeah, I'm a P on. Were you always liked to sit? Oh, I see. Wait a minute. Are you leaving the cat alone by itself a lot. No, I mean the dogs just hanging out with ron's dog at her house so they can play it again. But you ever had varans house and you're not at your house for extended periods of time? No, not more than a day or so. I think that's what it is, but yeah, I've left use in a day. I left them for weeks, but he knows the dogs. Not all lonelier. Weirdly. the only got two cats. They like the adults or hate each other though? No. Just implements and old lady cranky. Oh, she hates the other one though. She's all for everyone. Everyone hates the dog. Hates most people would've said fucking old cats get fucking. Either they stay cool or they just become a cycling.

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       Chicks get old. When they get like 45, they start hating 20 year olds. Really normal. It's in dogs to uphold the. Oh man. People get real angry. Women get angry when you don't want to fuck them anymore, so we're thing, especially if they've. They've put like a big part of who they are in that vested in that the big part of their identity and people want that. I'm hot or whatever that is. Yeah. When that shit goes away, man, it's rough. You better kesha, you imagine. I would have loved to have seen. What would that. Do you remember what? Who's that woman? She was in body heat. Kathleen turner. Turner. You remember what she looked like when she was young? She was romancing the stone. Yes, so I think body heat was always that. Sharon stone. Sharon stone, romancing the stone. She was one of them.

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       She was the fake one with Michael Douglas. Both the same people. Was it for the roses came later? No, there was a, there was like two. I guess I'm thinking that romancing the stone was like a fake Indiana jones in my head. It was like a comedy and I just remember sliding down the legs and between the heads. I feel like there was a fake one with um, Sharon Stone, like a similar. Maybe that's body. No, no, no, no, no, no. I mean like a similar sort of like romance, sort of swashbuckler adventure type movie. Like really similar. I know you only thing I remember elsie did with sliver and it was just like, I was like, oh, she was so basic instinct and it's deliberately stepped a letdown. Total recall that you're like, she was barely. I mean she was in it but not like it wasn't like a main.

Speaker 2:          00:18:43       And you're like, wait, who's that girl? She was so hot in the first basic instinct, but in the second one she was so gross. Why? Because she was trying to be hot and sexy again and it was Just like a, it was like a bomb. They looked like a bomb that was seconds fRom going off the shelf breaking apart. This is the comfort level that you would have if you fucked her. It would be that feeling where you would were terrified that you were going to just stick your dick into and she just kind of crumbling and her soul would screech away. She crossed her legs. She did that same crossing the legs thing and you're like, fuck, this is not right. It was like she was trying to be sexy and slinky and here's a completely different kind of sexy that'll older ladies have. They can still pull off some sexy like women even in their fifties can still pull off.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       The graduate lady was pretty sexy. Yeah, but you got to be like. You got to slowly creep up on a dude in like dear yourself with your affection. You can't like spread your legs like you're 20 anymore. It doesn't work. That's. It's. Not only does it. I got to think about how many times have you done that? How many times have you done that over the years? Do you have creases on the sides of your thighs from opening your legs as wide as possible? So many thousands of thousands of times a year. Is that what the fuck is going on here? You're, you're, you know, you're 50 years old and you show me your pussy. Hey, slow down. That's a jewel. That's a gift. Of course it does. Of course it happens to somewhere. Of course it happens everywhere in boston at the chicken place and all that crazy redneck later though. You all through my teens. I know. No, we do not. We do not. We're all there. We're just coasting. She had no idea. She didn't know what she was showing us. Was a harsh. She didn't know. She thought it was something sexy. Shit. Breastfed like nine children. they were monstrous.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       They were fat and they were flat at the same time. There were everything. That's wrong. A tip. Do you remember that? Barely. I just want us to see them when we had to run out the side door. Yeah. When? When the second show. We didn't even stick around. There was so many knuckleheads in that crowd. Stupid fucking room. Horrible. I was packing up their chinese food. As you're on stage doing jokes, they're stuck. Prop brown bags or stuffing them full of leftover chinese food, trying to deliver the stuff you've worked on for two years. You sure? Fair a little bit, donna. Me. I had a good time. You wouldn't go back there and a headline if they called, you know, don't ever call you again. It's not comedy. No, I wouldn't go back either. It wasn't stopped doing those rooms. Yeah. Well it wasn't the best room.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Dinner grow. Go on stage. She just stepped right up to take a picture with me. yay. Alright. oh, that's a good picture. I guess it was probably the same girl. She's walked onstage the middle of my set and wanted to take a picture. I'm like, get the fuck outta here. WhaT do you. What do you never see anybody outside of your neighborhood before you have all your teeth cache. The western Massachusetts is very tricky. Parts of it. A beautiful like amherst. Umass is fucking gorgeous town, great town. It's a cool, like it's a really interesting place because it's really intelligent and you know, because of the college is pretty much any college town is gonna have a higher level of intellect or at least her curiosity. Cambridge great place, amazing place. Uh, but that's, you know, the city of boston essentially. It's just a suburb of it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       But when you're in boulder, perfect example, boulder, great town, one of the reasons why it's a great town and so people are so smart, they're just because of the universities there, you know, it always helps having to use a university in a town. But God damn it doesn't make a bunch of fucking bleeding hearts to bunch of liberal pussies too. That's the other problems. Yeah, man, you can't have it. Oh yeah. Rent in town. There's not a lot of manly intellectuals in those towns, you know it because it becomes like, really, I want to say manly in, in, you know, like, you know, if you knew you're good too much, liberally new, bougie, because at a certain point you grow up to the point where like if you bump into somebody like, oh, sorry, I didn't do that on purpose to job. Okay, cool. Sorry about that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       They're just walk away. You don't have to fucking fight. Yeah, I can dummy. No, that's not what I mean. What I mean is there's too many hippies as too many people that don't have their shit together. There's tOo many people. Like, man, I don't even need many men. I just need this backpack. And you know, and people still tolerating those people like, dude, okay, yeah, this is not perfect. You're right. You're right. It's not perfect, but you can't camp here. Camp camp in front of my house. You gotta get the fuck outta here. You know this, there was, there's too much of that there. Yeah. There's too much of people who only want to look at the super liberal super minded point of view and a really interesting. There was a, I think are talked about this, but there was that rick santorum, guy was doing a debate, not a debate but a

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       thing when we're sitting in front of a really liberal college in New Hampshire and he was talking and they were talking to them about marriage and he's like, I think marriage is between a man and woman. There's, why can't it be between a man and a man? And he goes, okay, what about this? What about three men? Is that still marriage? No, no, that's different. Well, who's to say so why can't it be three men? And it's a really good point though. Why can't it be. shouldn't be allowed to say what a dog is like, yo, okay. Unless you clearly see the dog doesn't want it. But dog, I don't think so because the dog can't say yes I do. How about a tree? No man, she's fine. Why not?

Speaker 2:          00:24:23       Human beingS the consent? Yeah, a loving union between human beings. Why can'T you have three? Why can't you have four or five people in worlds? Embar and what's his name? Merits. Sandra bernhard of the other lady was embark and tom arnold married somebody else. Oh really? Together they married her. I don't remember that at all. That's interesting. Yeah, but these people didn't want to hear it. They're like, you know, you're being irrelevant. He's like, why? I'm saying it's a man or woman. It's been a man or woman for thousands of years. You're saying iT should be a man and a man. And I'm saying, why not to men what happened? Why? How abouT two women? Three women get married. can amanda mary, three women why? And he's right. Why can't they knOw that they should be whining problem? Yeah, I mean people should. The social stigma and everYthing, it should all.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       It should take like that's it. If people go, if people look at you and go look at this crazy ass hole with his three wives, like I don't even wanna hang around with him. That should be as punishment, but what I don't get. Why you shouldn't be allowed to. Yeah, exactly. The only punishment should be origin. People think it's weird. Those people won't like you. That's the only punishment, but these people. It was really fascinating the way they were treating that, that dilemma in the audience. You know, they couldn't see that. It was just as close minded as the people. The guY who was anti gay marriage is just as close minded. They're like, no, you're being irrelevant. This is a straw man. Straw man argument to do that stuff. They told us they're on people that are against changing the marriage ideas, changing gay marriage to to include it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:52       It's because they valued their type of marriage and when you allow other people to enter it, that is not your type of marriage. The man on one girl like cheapens the value of what you have. I would say that may be true, but if that was the case, how come nobody got mad at the bachelor or who wants to be. Who wants to marry a millionaire or any of those fucking stupid shows. I mean if anything did devalue what what marriage is, it's drive through marriage. Casinos in vegas. You didn't like that when they heard about it. Yeah, but that's totally illegal. How can we not fighting that could just drive into a place and elvis can marry you in vegas and holding onto that. Just holding onto like, it's, it's just this way. This is what I have in common that you don't. Oh man and a girl.

Speaker 2:          00:26:36       It's just people are assholes. They don't care about stupid shit. If, why, why would you care? You know? Look, I don't give a fuck what anybody else does. You know, the only reason I got married because it makes my wife feel good. She likes anybody gets married. That's why women like the women like him, they like to be able to tell their friends are married. I had kids with her and I'm not going anywhere. I love it. I'm super happy if it's written on paper or not, I'm not going anywhere. But when you see things written on paper, for some people it has. Leslie is extra significance or culturally you're allowed to say, no, we're married. You know, like this is the level of the fact that you're legally in tangled. you know? Even though it's like a ridiculous notion to get legally entangled with a person, especially when there's 60 percent of them get divorced and have to sort out there.

Speaker 2:          00:27:26       Yeah. Most of the show they have not going to last, but so why should you get involved? Because you love someone so much that that's how mine was. I'm like, I'm willing to do your writing forever. Yeah, but, but you know, in, in looking at it that way, you know what I mean? Just in just discussing it, it's all ridiculous on marriage is ridiculous. You. What's what matters is how do you feel about a person? Do you love them? You love being around him to express that you have something really special together. Boom. It doesn't have to be written down and a button. A bunch of other assholes get to agree that you're legit now. Oh, that's fucking silliness. And so why would gave people want it? The only reason is for insurance purposes, so sick ones in the hospital, you know, loved ones, but you fill it up with a boyfriend and girlfriend or a best friend.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       How about if you don't have a loved one and um, I'm immune. Me or the, I'm the urine, my only friend in town and if I get sick I'll say, please contact ari shaffir. I don't have parents are my best friend. If you contact him, why can't you do that? But if you move in with a chick, I feel like three weeks, then you have to go to the hospital. You're like, ah, fuck it. Let her visit. What are you trying to say? Abortion. Gay marriage is legal in Canada for the board. Really? Local. Don't know though. Of course it should be illegal. It of course it's silly, but of course why that when it devalues their marriage, I feel like the same as when a black person lives on your block and it devalues a property of her home. And that's exactly what you're sort of doing.

Speaker 2:          00:28:48       I don't want them here. Would, if you know neil tyson moved in on your neighborhood, do you really think that would devalue it? Tyson, that the really famous astrophysicist. Oh, black guy, brilliant. Super genius dude. He never seen him rate youtube property. Perhaps. How could it, he's a super, super racist, wouldn't know. They drive by and go, oh, and he has kids and they assume as kids will steal. Sure. Imagine that like, fuck, how long is that going to be fighting as is that going to be a little bit in my block. It was a nice black family and then their kids inherited it after awhile and they had their. They were a little, I don't know wherever they were from, but like there are more party people and they had a car parked in, there were bullet holes in it, so my mom just start referring to them as the murderers, murderers, homes.

Speaker 2:          00:29:39       They had a car with full of holes in it. God damn it. I didn't see that though. Holy shit. Wow. Who shot at them? Did you ever ask him? No. No. Murderers, murderers. I mean, I didn't think there were murderers but not speak casually. Refer to them as how you are trained now. That was in your little head. It is fascinating how much, how few white people can relate to like really poor black people and crime ridden neighborhoods. Oh, you know, like district nine than it is like your life. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. Really bad neIghborhoods like you. You've seen what especially like in africa know you've seen the documentaries ever seen, uh, the vice piece on Liberia into their. Do you want to think it's the end of the world watched the vice piece in Liberia where they're eating irregular cannibalism, warm old, regular cannibalism in this guy, one of the, the war they talk about it's children.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       They would kill children. They would go over there and kIll the children, sacrifice them, eat their heart. They were alive, drink their blood, do all because it made them. TheY believe that it made them vulnerable and battle. Charles taylor, who's a crazy dictator, but nobody knows him just because his name is too normal. Really wasn't it? he was the dictator in Liberia. There's took power and Charles Taylor was vicious. What a brilliant move. Just have a really normal way worse than gaddafi or any of these people we thought were bad. Really horrible story. He let all that stuff. What was his name again? Charles? What? Charles taylor. Wow. Maybe not better, but I think that's the guy who makes converse all stars. Chuck taylor. It wasn't dave librarian. Charles taylor. We got it. You nailed it. paranoid that I got it wrong. It was the 22nd president of Liberia from 1997 till his resignation in 2000 friends and colleagues had to flee.

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       Really? Yeah. Whoa. Scary fucking place. She's crisis africa. Scary. there's so many spots are so god damn scary. do what they want. Why did your people take down tower seven heart? Well talked about it. After awhile I realized you know what? Everything down. I thought it was an insurance thing and ensure thing. It's like if it's old fucking knock it down. We can't do anything with it goes top to gone. Just knock it down. He just decided to be better. If it was attended by random like islam, could you imagine if you actually did have buildings already set up? If every building was set up with explosive, so at any point they could just look at it so you don't have to write rig it like that was like a thing. Well, when you want to get your building demolished, here's a good thing. You just press this button and the ability goes away. You just have to, you know, hire some monkeys to fucking pick up the happiness that you manage them. That's how they did every building they couldn't because everybody would be like, people will be just trying to get there. Another plane that was supposed to go that waY. Supposedly. When was that going to happen?

Speaker 2:          00:32:24       There was a bunch of plans. One of them that got shot down that was supposedly they don't know where that was headed. There might've been headed for the white house. Yeah, that's what they said was headed south. That was 93. That was the one that they said that the people brought it down, but the same. Um. Yeah. But um, uh, yeah, rumsfeld actually made a mistake in an interview and said he got shot down. Really? Yeah. He said, uh, you know, in 93 they shot down a 93 flight. 90 three. He like said it before. There's a lot of people that are positive that it was shot down because of how far the debris was. The debris went as far as like seven miles and then they made that let's roll thing. I've heard that before and my thought on that was like, that'd be okay if they shut that down clearly by the other three, like it's going to be.

Speaker 2:          00:33:12       It's going to find is something down. It's tough choice, but you got to do that. There were eye witnesses, this other fighter jets who knows. Either way it's horrific. If they crashed, it's horrific. If it got shot down, but it's somehow or another people want to know about that. The mystery, the mystery of what happened. Do you think they were starting to hijack somewhere in the middle of mid conversation going and you know, they checked my bag, they checked the whole fucking bag was pre nine slash 11 was still too much security for a lot of people. Some people were probably upset, but my. My take on it is when bush got on, when they, when they told the whole story, the whole let's roll story, you know that the guy said, let's roll. As they got out and they were going to go fight the terrorists and they brought the plane down.

Speaker 2:          00:33:57       My bullshit alarm on my bullshit alarm was going off. I was like, this is a story I have no idea, but it does sound like a great story. This is like Jessica Lynch member. They had that story where they said that they had rescued her and hail of gunfire because she was being in prison by the iraqis and they saved her. This brave pretty girl. When it turns out she was actually in a hospital. There was no gunfire at all. Yeah, it's horseshit shit made about horseshit story and she came out public with it and people gave her death threats because she'll against the story. Yeah. Oh dude. She got a lot of death threats. The story, her story was quite simple. She got she. There was some sort of a firefight or some sort of a military incident where she was injured. She was brought into a hospital.

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       They came and got her from the hospital and they brought her back home. Okay. That's her story. That's what really happened with the United States. Said was that they had to go and rescue her and they went in guns blazing to go get one of our own dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And that didn't happen. Did not happen. What did happen? Just that. Just they went and got her at the hospital. Oh, they went on. They got the ones in the hospital, got her, brought her home and then they choose a local hospital. She was in a hospital in Iraq and they concocted a crazy story pretending that she was, you know, that they had rescued her, but all day they got their tissues. And then another example is that the a football player, what the fuck's his name? Human resources is really gay and he says like, I'm a guy that went in there and they just destroyed everything was, you know, like he just writes these press releases that are just is guy. I'm sure it's one person. One group actually gets to decide what the story would be, but the point of it is there's,

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       there's a fire, right, but they made him a hero for me here. At first. I think it's normal for them. It's standard operational procedure for them to lie, so anytime they get a situation to bullshit and spin the truth, it seems to be the precedent. It seems to be what they do. You know, when you. Whenever there's some sort of a situation and then they tell you a story, you can't prove that the let's roll is not real Bible. I didn't have to go down. That's why I was wondering why that If they took over the claim to the bitter end and like american, the font, just somebody dove powell and pow and I don't know man. I don't, you know, I, I don't want to believe that, you know, I don't want to believe that they would lie that much, but I do believe that they could though, if they thought it was coming to the white house, they would shoot.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       You should. I think you probably should. Going to get there. It's going to kill the people anyway, so you're making a decision to calibra failed. If people can't take control of the jet, if it does shut three attacks, right? Or to go talk to this play, they have no communication with it. It's going out of. It's out of where it's supposed to fly. Yeah. So if you could pull up the audio, pull up the audio of donald rumsfeld. Flight 93. shot down. Just pull up that donald rumsfeld, flight 93. Shut down. I think it's on youtube. He could of course. He could have also been a slip. He could've just. I fuck up all the time. I'll say, I'll say to you, I'll say, brian, why'd you do that? he called brian. I'd be like, no, I didn't because you don't even realize you did in the military too, right? What's that? He served in the military at some point. Rumsfeld? No, never really hawks. No, no. That's the thing about all of them.

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       If the people who bombed the mess hall and the people that get the bonding in Spain or the people who attacked the United States in New York shot down the plane over Pennsylvania, pentagon

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       shot down because he's different. He's referring to the people who did the bad things. Yeah. That sounds like he was saying brought down the plane. Shot down. Yeah. Like they brought it down. They died, but he was talking about the bad people. They wouldn't be the ones who would have shot. That's a bad video. Okay. So now we know. He didn't really say that

Speaker 5:          00:37:50       I smoked mouth poop today by accident. There is a huge mark about this big that's been outside of my back patio for the last couple of days and it hasn't moved like a word at all. So I've been looking at everyday. I mean as an been, hasn't moved at all what I was trying to say that, but as it moved forward at all, but it was really cool because it's like there's like a little passe cheetah for look like cheetah for on it. Like it would be a chia pet cheetah cheetah. That was like, well, oh I see like the pattern with cheetah and then there was like these weird parts that looked like almost like feathers have like an hour. It was just really weird, like looking at it everyday and then today I shut the door really hard and it fell down and it just start vibrating for about 10 minutes. Like it wasn't dead. It was just vibrating. So I'm just sitting there at it and then

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       it shoots out like this orange fluorescent orange thing. I think it was shit, but it was like fluorescent orange. It looked really weird, like it didn't look real and then it flew away out of nowhere. So I'm sitting there like, what the fuck is that orange stuff? is it shit? I just flew away. Yeah. So it fell to the ground, had an epileptic seizure for like shit all over itself and then flew away. It's just shit out like a, like a super, super small little bubble of like fluorescent orange shit. And so I'm sitting there like playing with it with a match, a stick. I'm just looking at the orange and I put on the end of my cigarette and smoked it.

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       I don't know why I did it. Just to see what would happen. You got a real problem about it. It was weird looking with orange. C, people were Thinking there's a show in march. Third you fuck with people keep saying mark. Third, the new york's fucked up on the day. Third may, ladies and gentlemen, the people asking about, um, what's the. There is a March 3rd show in new embraer California. But uh, we had it listed as march, third and fourth or whatever the fuck it was in New York city. And it's not New York city's may. So I apologize for that. What's the vendor you don't? Um, I don't know. Some theater. What does brian do you know the now I know. Well, we're doing. There's a ufc on fox. I'm in New Jersey has referred the mat. So we're at the manhattan center and then at the tabernacle in atlanta on 4:20.

Speaker 2:          00:40:01       Oh shit. Crazy. I'm trying to do my special. They're just trying to organize it if as quickly as possible. August, it's a little more, I feel like I have to. I feel like I have to know why not. You should do That and be there. Right. Doug benson does every year. What types of special? Every year on the cd on four slash 20, which is a. He's no one is more like marijuana connected. IT's inexorable. You can't pull the marijuana from day. You can't recognize. Where does doug and the marijuana begin? Where does the marijuana begin and you know doug, you know what I mean? This last time, that last ice house, he seriously, from the beginning to the end, did not stop packing bowl, smoke, packing, cold smoke. Whenever people ask density. Good. I was like, what? You just give them another pipeline, which is what's really crazy is there's like a conspiracy that he doesn't really smoke weed because I guess he got on some show somewhere and gave like a halfhearted bong hit and nyla.

Speaker 2:          00:41:02       He's not far from the truth. Fake stoner, donald sutherland and invasion of the bodY snatchers. When he found a woman at the end, he pointed her out. I remember that. I don't, I don't think I saw that one. Well, it's like everybody had become one of the aliens, the been taken over by the body snatchers, but a few people stayed awake and we're surviving by, you know, by figuring out how to stay awake. And uh, this woman came up to donald sutherland, [inaudible] she's, you know, they were in the resistance together and she was like, hey, I finally

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       got free. I'm, everything's fine. And he looked at anybody because he had been taken over and if he saw that the body's natural zombie movie or no, it's an alien alien. These pod students dope. One of the body snatchers with donald sutherland is all fucking great movie. They did it with. Not meg. Meg tilly. Yeah, tilly. jennifer tilly. I think it was meg tilly. Meg tilly was the real kind of innocent one in jennifer tilly who was kind of like, the dirtier one gets dirty thing was meg. Yeah. She's apparently sirius pro, right? Yeah. We met her in open nantha. Yeah. Yeah, she was cool. Um, uh, but meg tilly was her sister and her sister was the star of the. There was a more modern version of invasion of the body snatchers. Still pretty fucking good. But god, I remember getting like a little action movie. He, you know, wasn't like as good as the first one that donald sutherland. One is shit that's back when donald sutherland was just a fucking killer actor to me. Still is. He's still in the house. Yeah. Donald sutherland was fucking awesome man. That evades the bystanders. I forgot about that. I'm going to see that this week. That's a good one man. And whenever this on netflix, I saw. What did I go see the other night? I saw that. Uh oh. I saw the wolf movie. Which one? American wearing gray gray.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       It was, it was fun. It was fun, but it made it out like wolves or just jacking people left and right up there like he was hired to shoot wolves and the wolves were like, we're running at people full clip and he would take them out like it was a sniper. Like that's one of the opening, which never happens. Man. Wolves don't just run on people so often that you need a guy with a rifle who's a sniper picking the wolves off or that's not real, you know, so these, it was weird because like he saves a guy. Wolf's were like, there were like monsters in this movie. There weren't like wolves. They were like, he took wolves and gave them some. It was like some unnatural pack of wolves. They behaved completely unnatural. So it was like it was, it was, it was part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       It was hard to swallow. I would've liked it if they were diseased or turned out. They had got some fucking crazy radiation or experiments. Yeah, that makes sense. But instead they try to play it off. Like these wolves are killing people. Wolves have only killed 100 people ever in the history of humanity. Really? Yeah. There's like a website where there's a wikipedia, but there's also another website that like documents, wolf, human deaths, and a big majority of them, I believe are in Russia. I think in Russia it's more common. They got meaner people up there and meaner wolves, more bad ass thing of, well, if a 10th and a guy had been killed and he was half of the yellow, this is far greater than you ever could have imagined. Yeah. Well it's super rare. There are a woman died like I think in 2005 or something like that. We'll put that in, in, in Alaska, but she was running and I think I think if you

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       fuck up and you just run by a wolf in the wrong time, they can't help but chase you like a dog just like a cat with a ball of yarn and they'd say that's a big part of a mountain lion attacks is people are jogging or people riding bikes and they just can't help it. The mountain lion thinks they're running away, which is the next operating system from by the way. They announced out in mind, which is so weird. It seems like they're getting to the bottom of the barrel of cats with apple and the whole cap thing and it's just like, you know, android with her other little names that they're. They're just. They shouldn't even have to see which. Which product or an animal gets think first or name it after something. Smartest. Fuck. We'll catch a big on the internet. Chimpanzee. Why can't that be, you know, mac chimpanzee, cat.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       Maybe that'll be a 20 from then on. You know what they'll do? They'll just. Genetic engine. My cats are pretty to look at it. I don't want to see monkeys. Love chip and I turn on my coherency. A big ape. I don't really. I don't want to see a. How dare you. It's like looking at a guy naked. I'd rather see a cat. Really? Yeah. Dude. I love looking at chimps. You don't like looking at champs. You're. You're so weird though. Do you think that that was part of the animal side of? No, I mean like if I see if I, I, if I go to the zoo, I love looking at monkeys and apes. but your computer, you don't like it. If I see it every day, I don't want to look at monkeys everyday. That's what a cat's. Okay. Yeah, I guess he can't look at it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:54       I go look at tiger's almost everyday because to me they're like avatar. That's what I'm saying. tiger really is like an avatar creature. Have tigers didn't exist and it was in the movie avatar. So gigantic, gigantic colors are spectacular, you know, the whites and the black stripes in the yellow and orange, like tigers are amazing looking like why would nature ever want you to be so beautiful? And that's fucking other animals ways of. I'm watching out for the tiger. Protecting myself. Yep. Got handicapped a little bit. Yeah. Maybe he made theSe, this guy is so bad ass. We got to make them really bright. It should Be bright. Then if it was the same thing, gorillas don't kill people very rarely. they killed people. People fuck up and you know, jog over a nest or something like that. but for the most part, gorilla was vegetarians.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       Yeah. They eat bamboo and shit. They don't even eat monkeys. What do you think about this Virginia stuff with abortion? Fucking crazy illegal. Pretty much the trying tO. Well, have you heard the, um, the thing about ultrasounds? Yeah. They're saying that you have to get an ultrasound before you have any sort of procedures because they want you to look at It. Yeah. I want you to recognize tHat that's a life form somebody, somebody, somebody said that, um, one of the democrats said something like, uh, this is the first time that we've ever dictated like a medical procedure. We've cOmmanding a medical procedure. I'm definitely the weird liNe to cross. It's a total weiRd line to cross because you're a, you know, you're, you're making the decision for the person, you know, you're, you're deciding, hey, you have to do that. You know, they could get an ultrasound if they want to.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       They know they can sit where you're making them. You're making them look at it. That doesn't make sense to me. That doesn't. I don't see why you one more time before you do it. Yeah. Why do you, we know what's going on here. The real issue is what's going on here? What's going on here as you're killing a baby? One guy said it. It goes. The only reasons it's legal. One of the republicans only reasons legal because, because, uh, it's for convenience and I was like, that's true. that's what we decided as a society. Yeah. We'll let that go. Yeah. It's a weird line right though, because at a certain age you can't do it anymore when somebody is months old. Weird. Too crazy. But that's what we do all the time. That's when we raise the speed limit. Fifty miLes an hour when you know, this is going to mean more deaths. This year dude, I had a friend back in New York who, uh, his girl got a late term abortion really late, like really late, like it was illegal and it was, have the number, I don't.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       It was a, it was reallY crazy because she was showing really? Yeah, she was showing and uh, and she had an aBortion. It's fucking dark man. It Was dark and they wound on, went on to have children together, which is even good as they went on to have children together. But at the time I was really freaked out by. It really freaked out because I don't remember how many months it was in, but it was enough where, you know, they told me, I was like, oh shit. Like this is dark man. You know, it's, it's, I think that should be allowed to do. You should be allowed what to do. What do you mean later abortions? You should be allowed to do them. No, no, like get them. Oh, you should be able to get them to the same thing. There's no reason for that. Like clearly at some point it's like this light is going to continue.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       I think Whatever it is right now, it's fine. I think that's enough time for you to find out that you're pregnant and you need to do either make the decision, yes or no, but I think anything after that, after what? Like, like late term abortions. WhaT month is that? Um, I think three is that what it is, is the longest you can go. So you know, I think with late term is six and on. No, I'm saying what it is now. It's six months, six months. Jesus christ. That's a baby. People still want to do it at four. That's crazy. That's just to me, that's crazy. That's human life. It's very clearly human life. One difference between. But let me, let me get. Let me be real with you here. Part of part of what you're saying, you're kind of being objective about it and you're being honest about it, but part of what you're saying is a little bit for shock value, but no, four months while you can't even see a bulge at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       Oh yes, you can. Yes. For months never been in a science museum, so, but three months you can't, but for months you can. You can as well look this up. I think three months again as well, so then you can see it, but it's still okay to do it that way. OkaY. Let's look at fetus. I think it's remarkably soon that you could tell it's person. You've seen a baby's butt hole before you just brand. So when would you think it should be illegal? As soon as you can see any sort of bulge. Yeah, look at this three months, dude, but that's what you're saying. That's when you think it should be gone. This is three weeks. This is. I mean, this is 13 weeks. This stuff. That's a baby man. It's a fucking baby sucking its stomach. Three months. Can you see it through the stomach?

Speaker 2:          00:50:36       Can you see a bulge in the woman's stomach? Now I want to just show me a picture of. I don't know how much blown that up maybe. I think for different. some women. Yeah. So, okay. You're saying that's too far. That's too far. And it's like how far that sound by the way. That's image. This is a real image. This is an image of what it's represented. This is what it looks like. Yeah, it's a human life, but it's like almost immediately, um, you're saying with our, with our current microscopic, uh, like abilities. As soon as you can make it out based on that, that's how it should be illegal. That's where it's life. Well, it's interesting. That's the, that's a really good question. So random. It is a really good question, but at what Point in time does it become a life? Does it become a life when it's two sales?

Speaker 2:          00:51:17       No, is it 20 cells and I think as soon as they start moving on its own, so it was it going to leak. It can start leading to life and it's like life, but it's life inside you, man. When you, when you have children, when your wife is pregnant or if you ever have a girl that's pregnant, you touch your stomach. When you know the baby's only a few months old, they start kicking man. So it's when you can feel it through the stomach skin. I mean that's some living thing inside of her. I don't know where you can feel it like the week before you can feel it. That's not a living thing. Um, no, it's still living is not quite strong enough to get through the skin layer. It's moving. I'm saying it's, it's a, it's a living thing, mean living way before that, but it can't.

Speaker 2:          00:51:53       It can't. Like you don't know that it's moving around until you start suits, when you can feel that's what you think is true. When I was just saying hand, you should feel totally on its moving long before this late term abortion shit. It's moving, you know, I don't know when you should be able to draw a line, but it is a. It's a philosophical in a moral question, right? It's like what time does it become a life and no one is really wrapped their head around that, but for a lot of liberal people, they don't even want to address the argument. IT becomes more of of you trying to take away a woman's right to choose. We'll look at their names and the tooth, but the tooth, but not even against each other. One is pro life. The others not anti-life. Right. And one is pro choice. The other one's not against people having choices. Yeah, but it's the choice to kill you. That's my choice. Yeah. But that one prolife once a month and I haven't talked about the same things sort of they are though with what's really crazy is the most pro life people are also pro war.

Speaker 2:          00:52:48       It's one of the funniest things ever, man. This is the weirdest thing ever. How many. I mean the numbers are staggering. How manY people are concerned about the babies and how many people are out there and they're the same people that support the war and the same people that would be happy to, you know, to support the troops. Did you ever more troops? You ever have a um, drive by one of those, a bunch of groups of fucking weirdos get on the corner with flags and big signs, honk, confused, support our troops. Like, how is this helping anybody at all? How has this, how is this boosting morale for people who aren't really there is it, is it for the random soldier to that may be getting shipped off and gets to see this before they leave? What is this for? Is some

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       kind of rah rah, rah. Dedicated. What do you, what do you think this is? Yeah, but people do get mad at you if you don't honk. I've seen there was, um, on the corner about three or four miles away from here. There was this one intersection that was like a hot intersection for some reason for gaY marriage folks. People that were anti gay marriage and people that were into the war for same corner and the one member of that proposition eight shit, when that was going down, they were all just lined up. You know, marriage is between a man and a woman and god is not in the fucking quoting psalms and shed and holding it up. Punk if you believed marriages for a man and woman and the other time was this war thing. People were fucking screaming at them. You know, people screaming at each other know, get the fuck out of America. There was several times where I drove by where people in cars, we're screaming at the people on the street and they were screaming

Speaker 5:          00:54:17       back and forth at each other was just arrest him because it's against the law for you to honk your horn, so telling people to honk your horn, be against the law to honk your horn. It is. Why do you have a horn? It's only no way you can get a ticket for a honking horn for no reason really, for no reason to go. Maybe you saw some shit right there. I thought I saw some shit. What's the reason you see that guy? The guy that was coming? No, the other lane that was coming towards me. There's someone who's headlight. Yeah, but still it's telling you to do something illegal and people holding signs up for that. Really illegal. I feel like that's one of those myths and I feel like you should be able to like drive through an intersection and honk and your friends.

Speaker 5:          00:54:57       Can you do that? I think it's one of those things where it's like it's illegal, but no one's ever going ticket for it unless you've started just honking your horn for no reason. If you saw someone in the corner and there was a cop there and you are brett brown, what's up? You know? Do you think, have you been arrested for that? Is that what you would say? Get arrested but get ticket. You get fined probably or a warning. Most likely we got too many rules. There's way too many. If that really is a law that's. That's pathetic. I mean, you shouldn't be a con. You shouldn't be blaring. You're fucking hormone everywhere, but there shouldn't be a law against it. Here's a really interesting video online. Um, it was taken in Nevada where some dude went through a sobriety checkpoint and wouldn't answer any of the questions. I remember that. Did you see it go, I know my rights to roll down your window to place it goes. Is that a direct command or not? I think I was like, please hold on your window is like, no, I will not. It just kept standing there like, oh bang, that is

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       you're. There's actually a few of those videos online. But uh, that is what, you know, when, when a cop says, you know, I want to check your car.

Speaker 5:          00:55:54       Yeah. You don't have to say yes or say no. No, no. They don't. They say an asking matter. Ma'am, could you please open the car door? You have to say, all right, we're going to check your car. Okay. Not okay. In the end is really imPortant because you go, oh, no, no, you're not going to check my car. Alright, we're gonna. Bring the dogs. Go get your dog. That's procedures that we need to do some weird dude check in my trunk. Yeah. They have to ask in a way that's asking that Donald Trump, they can't say that. The problem is they'll just get the dog and then they have a dog. They make the dog bark and go, yep. Alright, we're checking your car. Now if the. Well, how many do you think cops actually plant evidence? Do you think that's not. I don't think they plant evidence. The majority. I'm sure they have plants in it. Evidence, but cops planting evidence. Humongous majority. Never planted any evidence. I mean everyone says the cop is planting evidence, but you know that fucking guys just like, why would I do that? Now you remember that movie cocaine cowboys. do you remember that movie? That

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       was the movie of the documentary about the eighties in miami and how fucking crazy the cocaine world was. Do you remember that shIt? One of the things we've talked about was that there was one year that were an entire class of the police academy, the graduating class. All of them either wound up dead or wound up in jail for corruption. Really all the. The whole police after a while where they all just like tell the other ones is how we do stuff. I'm like, all right, this is way. It's done well. Especially the money amount of money that's involved in cocaine in miami and the eighties. It must've been fucking completely crazy. There's a lot of good cops. Most cops are good cops. The problem is, look, there's most people are great. You knoW, most people that I meet day to day in my life are, are fine folk.

Speaker 1:          00:57:44       There's only occasionally one or two people out of a vast majority that suck and those stand out and you go off. Fucking people suck. But for the most part, look in America and you know, in a nice place like los angeles where people are doing pretty good for the most part. I mean, you know, we're not starving to death. People were pretty god damn nice. It's pretty civil. Most people are cool. You know, the majority, the vast majority are cool, but if a few of them are cons you'll start going. People are going to the same thing with our so hard, but it's like some do but some don't at all. You know, one of what I was going to say about the video where the cop was talking to the guy and the guy wouldn't answer any questions. One of the things that was interesting about it was a fucking together.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       The cops were keeping him. Well, this count as being kind of shitty. I was like, I guess they knew they were being filmed or something. Yeah. There was a little bit of that too, because he had a camera and you're going to get to the asking them where they're pulling together. Yeah. Both the two cops, his supervisor came over as well know, you know, but they're just trying to make sure people aren't drunk. You know, love. When they get caught with the camera that's in their own car, they were like, you know, that's their. Yeah, they're dumb and it's just like, do you get so complacent that you just feel like what you're doing is right? I feel like they're gonna be able to erase the evidence. HoW old is this stuff? I don't know. It's probably a decade. A decade old. Do you think it works?

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       Yeah, it tastes shitty. Shitty. But you think it's getting you high? Probably still pretty high. There's a place down the street that used to be one of those, um, urgent care centers and now as a medical marijuana place, really not so urgent care. He didn't, wasn't a lot of money in that. Now they prescribed we'd licenses to so many of those billboards. Were you driving around people who don't live in la? I have no idea. What the fuck is going on here. This pLace is correct. There is maybe denver. Denver's really close. Dennis is just like this, right? Like there's a bunch of areas in dental strip for the farmers is a place that opened, like they're opening across from each other across, from each other. They're like there. It's ridiculous. It's one of the craziest things you've ever experienced your life and it's one of the reasons why so many of them are getting shut down when people don't realize how many of them there are.

Speaker 1:          00:59:45       When you hear about all these pot shops getting shut down, it's terrible. The pot shops are getting shut down. Absolutely. It's terrible. They're being prosecuted. Especially the people that didn't even do anything wrong. There's a bunch of people that are being unfairly targeted, but there's also a bunch of dudes are making a shitload of money. Someone we'd. They would have been in porn. There's some people that it's like, you can't even. You can't even open a shoe store without filling paperwork. Yeah, but they're like, fuck it. We're selling weed and you're like, can't do that. Doesn't give You a license to do nothing. Like our douchey friend that we were talking about that left his job and now is making tons of money selling weed. It's like he's no shining light of psychedelic live. He's like, he's a farmer, he's a farmer, he's a. He's a.

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       He's a farmer. What's cool is that place that's an ad next to the ice house, you can actually rent a space and grow weed there. Oh, and they gave you chemicals that go real cooperate. Yeah. It's like a place for rent and grow your own shit. Community gardens, but only for a week or so. Dope to America. Yeah. We're going to have to have those guys come on the show, but I don't know if they want to go public works guys. The guys from that place, from that community garden as a run that place. We'll have them come on with anonymous masks. You ask him. It's like, do you want to. Do you want to do it? Here's what. I wouldn't do it. If I was them, I'd want to stay as low key as an owner. I know. Look what you break down everything because. No, no, no, I couldn't.

Speaker 1:          01:01:02       No, I don't want to call tHat kind of attention to me. Yeah. You don't want anybody looking at you as the target because like I had that guy from oaksterdam and an oakland. He doesn't mind. He likes being a public spokesman. Yeah, but I mean, haven't they gone after him a bunch of times? Probably. I think there's a big issue right now with um, their, what they're allowed to write off. Like it's not like a regular business. They're not allowed to write off, they won't take tax on it. So I thought that's we're just trying to make illegal legal to take taxes, but they don't take, they must be taking some taxes from medical weed. I think it's a huge form of tax revenue, isn't it? Medical weed. I know they said they on their own. They said we're going to pay taxes, let's find a medical marijuana tax.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       Taxation tax revenue. What about in like are they now paying tax because I have to. Or are they just doing it because they let's find out. Oh, I'm here. It's still. And voters approve it. Okay. So they had to approve it. This is what it is. Voters had to approve marijuana tax. Revenue measure measure. Sixty percent of voters decided tuesday to honor measure m, a city. What major am who am with a citywide ballot measure that imposes new taxes on the sales of medical marijuana at brick and mortar dispensary's? It allows city tax, brick and mortar dispensary's $50 out of each one. Thousand in gross reimbursements. So that's five percent. $50 out of $100, isn't it? It's five percent. Yeah. So how much will they already get? Five percent is what their taxes. That's pretty good. Sales tax is eight point two. five data. It's on top of that I think.

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       Oh really? Think this is a city tax. Marijuana, los angeles, marijuana tax, whatever man. Pay the tax you get in to make a fucking shitload of money and you're spreading that love. Pay the tax. That's what I would say. They're making plenty of money or they are a little bit less hollywood lawyer. Prices a little already. Just stepped up. I feel are just starting to get out of hand. Receives a joke. Tell me, tell me. Pharmacies are $75 for an eighth and it's not that good. It's like good. It's good. Homeboy sold me an ounce for how much was it to 60? To 50 to 50. Shit puts you straight up. That's my favorite. That's my favorite. That's my favorite with his oji. Kush is just the greatest. Yeah, you bypass the stores, but I. I support the stores because I want to be able to go to them.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       It makes sense. I know that if I go straight to the grower, you're going to be a lung support. Great weed smoker. That guy gives you on wholesale prices. Yeah. I don't need to make that money that bad. I would. I would rather give that extra 100 bucks or whatever to the store so that they can make some profit and they can keep open. I like to conduct. Can't make a profit that I supposedly. They're not allowed to make profit, but yeah, I just read something like that. They were like, that's completely wrong. Is it that just read that where they're like, that's absolutely wrong. That's just a misinterpretation that this rule. I just read something. It's in the recent. Like web, huh? Yeah. Was on dick. I thought they weren't allowed to make profit, but they were allowed to be like, all right, you're getting paid $30 an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:03:54       You weight goes is you're not allowed to make profit like a normal corporation would, but would. The way you can do it is you can take a salary, you know, like say if you run the place, you could take a salary which is commensurate for someone who would be in your type of business so you could make a salary of $100,000 a year and weigh a ton. Mccormick was telling me one of the things that they do is, especially at osha damn guy, they funnel a lot of the money back into the community and the source of a charity and the in the form of charity in the form of grants. They do a lot of different things with their money and the guy who runs it takes a salary, pays all the employee's salary, but you're not allowed to strictly get rich off it. You can't make.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       It's not like the guy who owns it can make 60 percent of the profits. You can make as much as you want. Really? There wasn't nothing else. Not wIth mccormick was telling me. He was telling me he can't. Fuck. I wish I could. He was telling me that you have to have it, you have to, you take a salary and that's how it works. That's what your profit is. just your salary and you know, you could, but you could still, you know, a salary for a business that size, like what's, what is commensurating a few hundred thousand dollars a year. I'm sure you know, I mean if you were running, you haul fucking empire, you would, you know, which is dealing with the same amount of money or something. You halls a terrible example, but you know what I'm saying? You'd make a good, good chunk of change. You know, a ceo for some big fucking company makes a lot of goddamn money. If you're a ceo for some giant collective that's

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       responsible for millions of dollars worth of business every year, you should be gettIng paid well, right? Yeah. Well that's what the ceos of the banks did. There's rules, there's rules, there's not enough rules as far as like protecting the environment and too many rules when it comes to everything else. God daMn twat rockets. It got a psvt joe. This came out yesterday. It's actuallY, it doesn't come out until the 22nd. Is this a video game? But this is the new thing all the kids are talking about. It's a new game boy, new playstation thing and it's going to get into it. ToUch screen on the back and the front back. it's got three g building a back is just has a panel in. It's just touch sensitive. So like, yeah, so you can use with your steering. Well and it's also got double joysticks and check this out. It's got touch screen in the front finally.

Speaker 5:          01:06:12       Uh, it's pretty cool. I've only got to play with it a little bit today. I have an unboxing video, death squad, that tv doing a review. It's called the psvt. And, and what kind of games you get into this sucker. What school is it? The graphics are amazing, like they look like a home console video game and you can do your netflix on here and since it has three g you can do all the, all the stuff that you can do, like on a tablet, it has two cameras and surf the web on the camera front and the back and everything was about her life. I batteries about five and a half hours. Six hours. Uh, it's, it's pretty bad ass though. It just came out. It comes out the 22nd. But you can buy an early version of it. They send you one early. I ordered.

Speaker 5:          01:06:51       They have a early, like four people that preordered it. You can get a weaker noises making stupid song the hedgehog. Now shut that stupid shit off. Said. Oh, I don't know how to turn it off. Oh, that's ridiculous. Like there's a lot of stuff. So. Cool. Why would the music be so stupid? Oh, here we go. Medical marijuana profit is allowed under California law. should I read it? Sure. Fuck your wife ever eventually when it loads up, but yeah, I'm doing a review on it. A deaTh squad that was a fun so far. It's pretty awesome. And I like has, has three g and you don't have any contracts so you can just pay as you go. Uh, the cameras not that good, but the graphics, the screens amazing. The gains are amazing. You could download any, a lot of the previous console. So nowadays are kind of switching to where you download your video games. IT's still bind to the store. Oh really? Oh that makes sense. So instead of, so instead of getting a district, you just download it and you just download it and then you can delete it if you want to, you can delete it or whatever. The only negative really going to get rid of this. So you, that's going to be. Everything's going to be in a cloud downloads I guess. I like that though.

Speaker 5:          01:07:58       my learn loan for a quarter phone hEr, I want to go bad. I'll do it man. I don't want everything in the cloUd. I do like the cloud. If they do it right, like itunes just recently switched over to doing it right where it shows you all the purchase cd songs that you've ever downloaded on itunes and you can

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       look it and you could read down to 100 gigabytes of total songs. Oh, are you allowed to talk about what happened in Minnesota? Yeah. Yeah, because I only know pieces of this. Are you sure? Because I have to leave out. Right. There was a, a thing that ari shaffir does. It's all a lark. I mean he pretends that what he's doing is hiding marijuana all around town and then he calls it a hunt for the edible when it's really just lollipops candy. Who wouldn't do that to you? You can't handle it. It would be. It would be cute if you can handle it, but you can't handle it. So that said, but coincidentally I do live in a state where they could sell a really small stuff all the time. Right. But anyone pretty much here, it's not legal for us here. Yeah. So yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:09:04       So what happened? So yeah, I've had them before, but I had little scavenger hunts for this clearly fake only tobacco product. I'm noT marijuana. Whatever you think it is, just to see if you got high from it. Placebo effect. It's really easy with diabetes. But man, I got dizzy. Yeah, it's fun. People just made some clues and people just find it. And you have been organizing this through twitter. It seems like a solid plan. Well it's good that you're not using real pot because it's totally fucking heart attacks and freak the fuck out did. So you did this. So usually I do them not in a, in a specific type of place, you know, just do them somewhere like out. Right. I did it this time. I tried doing at the mall of America don't like fort knox. Yeah, it's all locked down now. I guess they have their own security and they have regular police there too.

Speaker 6:          01:09:55       And so what happened? Well, I uh, I decided instead of hiding it, like in the outside, like near a pillar or something, I figured there'd be less cameras. So I should go into a store and hide their increased business for them. Right. And so I did that, the store grubbY hippies out looking for fucking free. We'd also like, what kind of clues can I go, like, what's it around that I can think of a clue for. Um, and then I found a place and then I left, it was like good a building boom that I waited for, like, you know, a few hours, started writing the clues and then I started releasing them. It was great. And people that are looking for it first I narrowed down like a side of the mall, then like a floor and then like the store then like where? Anyway, so the show would just order.

Speaker 6:          01:10:38       The mc was on. I was texting outside and um, and uh, I just saw a cop to my right to my left just standing there and they're like, alright. And I was like, I looked up and I was like, oh fuck, this is happening now. I really didn't think it would. Yeah. And I'm like, fuck. They're like, we're gonna talk to you for. I'm like, oh, hey, is totally cool, but somebodies got to go inside right now. Just let them know that I'm in trouble because they're gonna have to find somebody like really soon, like the show just started like, I'm like 40 minutes to find someone to live nearby in minneapolis there. Just let them know that this is happening. So they did whatever the cop, let's just say, let's just say he was cool. um, so he didn't find any specific evidence. Um, so that wasn't a problem, but the ball security was trying to say I couldn't go on, they're going to ban me from the mall and the club is in the mall.

Speaker 6:          01:11:29       Oh yeah. And then rick brunson, the owner had to get on the phone and start yelling at them saying, who the fuck are you going to cost me money because that idiot fucking hide pot somewhere and hide fake pot. That's when he called you an idiot. He said, yeah, to the security. It's like, you're not going to cost me a bunch of money and refunds and disappoint all those people because he wants to be fucking moron. Wow. I explain that. What happened to you? Like what is it? I'M like, it's just for fun. It's where I'm, where I go. It's totally legal. It's just I want other people to have fun even though it's fake. It was fake. Fake. Yes. But I think they, they understood that. They're like, you can't even do that in California because it's only legal with a license and you don't have a kid's going to grab.

Speaker 6:          01:12:07       It isn't illegal. That's the thing. It's decriminalized in California to a certain amount as long as you don't think you're distributing it. So some people have said, what happens to a 15 year old gets it? I'm like, yeah, he gets high. Great time for them. What do you mean there's no problem? They're pretty sure the kid's going to have to take these kids who got them came the next day to the show did. Oh, well, lucky it wasn't really we'd. Yeah. Oh yeah. What happened was, uh, uh, the people who went to the underwear, I'll have that, have that store, but I shouldn't say because that labor is pretty cool too. Um, uh, I'm going to go on a limb and say it was still say her story. She was cool. She was like, I'm not going to press charges. Please take that any mentioned on my store so I don't get in trouble. Okay. So because it was a male clothing store, I wanted to hide it, a lane bryant at a fabric store, but I didn't think I'd get in there without being noticed as well. Like why would it even be in there? Because you look like something that would date a fat person.

Speaker 6:          01:13:04       Do you really think it looks like someone who did some ways if the world gets dark? Um, yeah. So the first one went and got it and the underwear and the next principal came in and they couldn't find it. So I start tearing everything up, like looking for it. That was an unintended consequence. That sucks. Yeah. But no trouble. They let me off like five minutes before I go on. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Did you go on stage immediately? Talk about it? Of course you did. It's the first thing I met with everybody. I'm just, um, I was just a. Yeah, and he got on the phone with me. They were like, he wants to talk to you on the phone because he was in edmonton on his land line and he was like, hey, first thing's first, you need to act like I'm yelling at you.

Speaker 6:          01:13:42       Okay, so now is your smile. Got. And I was like, yeah. And I started laughing. Don't laugh, don't laugh. I'm serious. He goes, it's not going to be any problem at all. I'm like, sorry dude, for cutting here because I don't fucking care. It's totally cool. I think if you've been running a comedy club, he's also a comic. No, it's totally fine. Yeah, you got to be careful. That's crazy. So don't fold. Repercussions. Got to be fucking careful. That shit's superly illegal in certain parts of this country and we don't realize it because as we sit here, even though that's another lane once doing, it's just

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       so lame. So you knitting is taking liquid acid in. Squirting it into. Don't imagine if you did the best that I was standing there with security and some people came up for the late show or something and they're like already brought something for you and they will open up the purse. I was like, no, no, no. But then she was like, it's okay. I'm like looking at like, don't know. There was a swedish fish. So those are just some like gumby product. Oh, that's delicious. I offered it to the cops and the lady cop was super hot. Really like super high. How high I was high. What? how hot? Like an la h. Wow. Like legit. Like I kept looking at her and I was like, you guys should come in and just totally should come in. He tried to get her to come to the show.

Speaker 2:          01:14:53       I've been trying. I couldn't go fully. Like so when you get off we should hang out. Totally. Conrad. I regret not doing it. She was so pretty. It was a little worried. Maybe she's starving. Intellectual conversatIon. A funny guy. Great sense of humor. She seemed like she got it too. Try to keep the handle or maybe she was dating the other really nice cop guide and thrown you and praising you. Probably. Fuck. So every time they shoot somebody, that's the deal. Don't shoot people down then. Dude, shit gets crazy. Do you remember the mall cop? she wasn't even a real. It wasn't a real tough. She was part of the mall cop. She was so pretty man. I was like, you guys should have a comment. We should responsive at all to you. She would smile. She knew that it was just something being an idiot.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       The guy mall cop was trying to pretend like it was a bad ass, but he couldn't really keep it going that much. Head of security was trying to really enforce the law, but who fucking cares? You get in trouble, but I could've. Could've wenT to jail. You know what, if somebody just showed up the joint, so this dirty jew gave me this joint. I can say that now and I smoked it. Whoa. Don't stop doing that. We're going to have be real from cypress hill on soon. Oh, that's cool. I've been going back and forth with them on twitter and arch barker. He's going to be on to one of the things about. Yeah, he's in America to monday. One of the things about a be real from cypress hill that he and I shared that he won't just take weed from strangers. He won't. He won't feel it there. We'd benefit from everybody. Yeah. Doug benson does. He gets involved but the government is probably getting high with them too and they're probably some some ways we just got like little gps signals in that. That's all you get high off at this point. Tolerance too high off gps. Gps crystals. Getting high off wifi. Didn't be hard.

Speaker 2:          01:16:42       How about how long before they actually just spray you with some shit they can track you with? Probably pretty. Probably already have the capabilities. We already have the idea that they can track it already. Yeah, I mean it's hard to find you just through your role on the grid. Yeah. Twitter, you're going to go going to burbank about the airport should go about your business. They don't care what you do most of the time. Most of the time until you oppose them, until you're ready to take over. Can you imagine the kind of taPping they have on ron paul's information? He

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       can't even order a pizza without them breaking down the word. And hoW long is the aardvark bar going to be here for him? He said til monday. okay. Amazing. So ignoring this ron paul cat and then pushing this rick santorum, dude on everybody. Well, at least it's not a mormon. There's been evidence of voter fraud in main. By the way, ron paul supposed to the one in Maine and they were uh, before even all the precincts were counted, they were giving it to santorum. They're saying is voter fraud and made really. I mean it's just a have to do. I'm paula when, once the prelims. Well, you know what man, I think this whole system is rigged. Of course it is really, absolutely, absolutely. Truly believe it. And I think these guys are just auditioning to be the ceo of a company or they're not even going to get a chance to say what the fuck gets to go on and they're not going to get it anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:17:55       Obama's gonna win again. A ball was way better than mitt romney. He's way more charismatic. He can look, they can do some hollywood math and the numbers and have you convinced that we're in an epipen economic, that he to the rich. Yeah. He came in the wrong time and the world that the world was fucked up when he got here and the country was fucked up, but in the time that he's been here held spins and puking the legislation that we've passed and help this and the economic stimulus and a. The things sort of whatever that national defense authorization act kills everything that he did. Everything. That's that thing that allows people to be detained indefinitely with no warrants. The fact that he passed that like it's just such an easy way to abuse the so gross. It's gross. It's consistently on my radio station that comes on like the news about the.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       About the, about the elections have predilections wherever they're happening. It just seems like when newt gingrich and perry and santorum and all the other mitt romney, it seems like to keep like just lying and then like going back on. Yeah, I did say this, but that's not what I believe now. It just seems like a little kids thing. Whatever they can so they can get their prize, but it's like enron, paul's and just as well, this is what I believe. A lot of this shit's not popular. Give me another one of those. Good, but it's like, this is what I've always said the same thing for always. Yeah. When they're afraid of going on the record for what they really believe. If it's not popular, it's real. They don't believe shit. They just leave. They want to be president. Like they're just trying to get elected.

Speaker 1:          01:19:20       It's like when you auditioned for a show that you hope you don't get. Yeah. We're like, this sucks, but like I'll put. I'll make believe humor. Rick perry is so lucky. He's dumb because now he gets to live the rest of his life without secret service agents wiping his ass everywhere he goes, because if he won and he could have fucking one, don't get me wrong if that guy. I auditioned for the role of president just four years ago. Okay. And he was just coached a little bit better and some more little hindsight prepared some. Yeah. You get some smart dudes behind him. It is attracting the best pr people. He's no dumber than earlier. He's no dumber than gw. It's just like an actress just to build your resume, build your resume, do it correctly. Unpopular at the right time. Exactly. He was popular one point in time. Do you remember? It was like that guy was like, he lOoked handsome, looked lIke fucking, but I rather than talking about obama

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       at some like democratic convention and they're like, oh, he gave a really good speech. People are gonna. Look at him noW. It's like a presidential guy. It's like having a really good game and the nba all star game. it's like having a good set on, on comedy central and all of a sudden it's like, oh, watch out. YeAh, it's an awesome chick. It's a movie. Yeah. I remember my, um, my friend who I will not name his name because he's a silly, silly fucking liberal. Not there's anything wrong with being a liberal, but he's silly. He's just one of those guys and when I, they believe it too much. I am very liberal and most of the things, most things I can't marriage and civil rights and most of those things. But um, shouldn't be attached to everything though. Exactly. I'm not on a team.

Speaker 2:          01:20:43       I'm not on team. This team that. And when you are, I think you're silly if you're a liberal by choice, you know, like, you know, in a category predetermined pattern behavior your fall or your conservative, either one of them is just silly to me. But this guy was like telling me like what a great president obama would make. And I go, why do you say that? What policies that he supports, do you, do you believe he didn't have a fucking. Nothing to say. He just started giving me like doubletalk. I go, do you eveN know this? Anything that stuff this guy does or do you love him because he's a good looking black guy and know the love, lIke supporting a black guy because you're. You got a little bit of white guilt and he didn't want to administer howard stern thing they did where they interview people and just messed up the facts like obama, obama, mccain is running together against someone.

Speaker 2:          01:21:25       Who are you going to vote for obama or mccain? Oh no, I'm okay. Do you think would be a good buy present for obama was like, yeah, I like his policies. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. Was it, was it. I'm trying to remember who that fuck that was good at. Maybe it's a tough crowd. Fuck, I wish I knew what it was. It was. Who's that guy? We met him in New York that time. The boston common boston comic. I'm like me. I was telling nick depaulo. Yeah. I think what I was texting or something. No, no, that's not what it was you. You joked around about jocks. He said something about john boston is all jocks. That's good. Yeah. That's what you said. A bunch of dumb jocks fuckers just cracked. Nick dipaolo is quick to tell you the word sweater or something and I was like, oh, well kids, we all kept below.

Speaker 2:          01:22:12       What do you think? what the venture? Yeah. He thought, well, you kind of dress a little bit like a hipsteR. Yeah, I guess they do and people that didn't know you, they would totally think you're a hipster until you hear you talk. Anything alternative comic, a filthy dirty mouth on stage. Yeah. they would take your alternative. Thank god you're not just so hard to be friends with an alternative comment. I can pretend that all that shit is funny. It's starting to go away. The lines, of course it is some real good people that just go up in that scene and then vice versa. It just comics. yeah, of course it is the the people that wanted to be alternative. They literally used to always do that. Yeah, but they all rooms and he goes to the store and you're like, oh, you come here to him.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       It's like, what do you mean six times? Yeah. He's just a comic. Yeah, he's smart enough to realize that, but a lot of these dummies, they. It was like, you know what? It was like, we found a cool club. This is like the cool kids club is the janeane garofalo club. Chechen rebel. Doesn't that sound like a serial church? Me? Yeah. Yeah. What would you say that? Because that's really low line because he was looking. I think he was imagining her doing. I'm doing what they do on stage and sang something mildly ironic. You know? It's not even funny. Shot at not funny. No. Work harder. You're not trying hard enough. Then you, your point of view sucks because it's not real. You're not really. You're just trying to fit into a mold that you think these little hipster twat heads are gonna. Appreciate. Clap, clap.

Speaker 2:          01:23:41       I saw paul, tom because talking about the state of alternative comedy podcasts in san francisco, jamie kilstein, his estate, his aides. He goes, it's really sucky right now. He's always people trying to Be alternative comics and sucky because they're trying to be this instead of just being. It's aids, aids, aids. It's not funny and they're super snotty about it. It's like the thing about the grossest thing, snotty, snotty nose, overwatch, it's you're not even putting out good art, like shut your mouth. It's not good stuff. It's not funny. You know the. The bottom line is it was created. Some of it is. Yeah, but that's good comedy period. Good. Anywhere there. The bottom line is the need for alternative comedy was created because the ones who were trying to do it weren't successful in other rooms. They weren't successful. Whether it's because they're performing for dme crowns or whether it's performing for people that didn't appreciate what they were doing, so they had to find people who did.

Speaker 2:          01:24:34       That's all well and good, but they became an a lot of ways. Not all of them. Totally generalizing and pigeon holing irony, this ironic disposition. They also became like sort of comedy bullies to, you know, like if you hung around them like bert kreischer is a terrible story about them being fucking shitty to him over the uc, whatever it is. Do you see being about how gross was experienced? Was there. Because when people are bullied, they want to bully back, you know, children that are molested go onto become a lester's. So weird. But then ian edwards, I've met him in like my mobile connection. I did call me on it, like whatever. Just keep talking stupid, keep rambling and go with an alternative. I'm like, what material do for this? It goes crowds and crowds, man. yeah, I've done it twice and had great crowds.

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       Yeah, I did the ucb. I loved it. I had a great time now, but the audiences, it's a comic artists and it's not all of them. It's just a few of them. It's just like cops, a few cuts spoil the whole pockets. What it is, that's what it is, what it is. Exactly what it is. That's why everyone's against them. Because those few cons. Yeah, and same with cops. Same with girls. You know, same with guys, you know, same with everything. The few people on this, I don't think congress anymore because all the comments that have been bad. I'm like, come on, wait, break it down because I'm not all of them. Yeah, but you're terrible. Yeah. But if it's like all about like whatever it is, I'm like, yeah, yeah, we did that. Just like I'm gonna give you a chance. But if they say they're needy, then I'm like, well I'm not needy, but I like the kick mit. I'm like, oh yeah. Right. That's fine. Yeah, we shouldn't do

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       it. Yeah. Well isn't that what all women want? Arash fear that some of them down one love, they'll want to know that you're going to be there for them. They all want you to listen to their, their highlight reel, highlight reel director act worse, dating a comic dating comic and you have to help them with their act. Do you think this is funny? There's nothing more of a turn off the grill going over her bits with you. Anyone going over the bits with horrible. Yeah, but a girl that you want to fuck and she. Okay. Okay. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. I want. I want you to listen to my. Listen to my child. Tell me things. It's funny. I mean dick is like a headache and your pants don't, don't, don't, don't. Let's just do it. And they just want tell me, tell me the things.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       This is good. I've dated a few callbacks. I started telling him now it's like, I am not going to help you with your act. I'm not going to try to correct you. If I see something like thematically you're doing that, I can see a fixed for like you should check out this room. Might do. Well they're like, I will do that, but that's it. Let's just give you suggestions of like directions to go. Yeah. I go to peers. There is something wrong with this bit man who's going to bid? Feeding scene too verbose or something like that. I kind of just sounding off. I kind of know anyway. If you're being objective about your shit, which always has. Somebody tells you they saw that. Like, I liked that joke. I'm like, do you think? Yeah, it's actually take it in there. It needs a little some or you know, they saw it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       You kind of know though, you know, when something needs something, if you're being really honest about it. Right. But sometimes they help you. They're like, well, have you ever thought about going from there into your, like your family right there and you're like, oh, I didn't know you were reading comics. They're not writing you a joke. They're just like an angle. You didn't. Yeah, yeah. Or good taglines or yeah. I had this king kong bit that I was doing and a louis ck pulled me aside. He goes, you know, it was really funny. You should say that. Cognizance really wife too. And like do this thing. Look king kong's d wife at home. Why this whole thing about king kong being like the most racist movie ever? You kNow that he was around these naked black women his entire life. He never gave a fuck. He saw one white chick and address and lost his fucking mind. It had to have her, you know, mean really exactly what that movie was. They were dancing. these black girls, they had feathers on shit. They were taking their tits, hanging out, drums, playing fire dance and shit. No one cared and he's like, hey, should I can congress and wife? That was why he was still married though.

Speaker 1:          01:28:23       That's lIke the angle you always go to see what holds them back. it keeps them from being funny comic again. A casually. They told me that sometimes. I think that again today, yesterday. Do you really stinking. Oh my gosh. Natasha again. Damn heavy. So weird. Did you even fucking imagine you guys just swapped back and forth and you're like, look, I know you left me before. But uh, I wasn't a man that I am now. I'm a different man now. I'm a different man now. I think it was totally

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       cool. Was totally cold back then when you went with duncan, you just go right to me. One second you blog and then as soon as you pull out, you net it right in her eyes and say, fuck you. I've been waiting for five years to do this. Fuck you. And give her a double fingers while you're naked. Fuck how many guys had done that, got back with a girl. Pretend to be in love with that, just so they could shoot a little bit. I can do that. And then just just say, fuck. You ever see that old movIe called the the, the era. It's about this girl who got jilted and she goes, well boy, it's to get revenge for like decades. That's like I spit on your grave. Yeah. I have grossed out that weight on like just to box and lindsey low and I think in like 12 years.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       And they would probably be doable once they hit the wall. You know who I think you can get you. Brett butler from grace under fire. A place to stay right there. You can take my face bright. But she talked about her and back on the last show about how crazy it was that she was one of the chuck lorre. She was a chuck lorre show. Grace under fire. That guy has just been around forever. Just turn them out, the hIts. And she, uh, she was all cracked out and she said there was always the, um, the rumor on the success that she had done some crazy thing, threw a drink in his face and he got, she got gone from that. Yeah. Powerful is, fuck you think he cares that you're ready to twelfth. Uh, you're not supposed to do that. A lot of money.

Speaker 2:          01:30:27       You're not supposed to do that. Anyway, that's what killed titus is show to ever turn something down for money. Like somebody offers a spot to this and you're like, that doesn't go with what I do at all. Oh yeah, definitely. It's like people can turn down money. Chuck lorre says I don't need, I have plenty of money. You just can't. I'll just not do your show or kill your show before it goes to cindy. You're going to be a complete asshole to me than you know. I'm not going to work for you if it kills you. that tituss show. But fairly syndication. Yeah. He had some crazy blowout. Maybe that tv show. I talked about it a few times, but no one could remember it. It's called Mr. Smith. It was about a monkey monkey. Vice president. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's in black and white. No, no, no.

Speaker 2:          01:31:00       That's your thing that Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Well this is a tv show aNd somebody uploaded a, like five second commercial on youtube the other day and so I finally sent me. So I find. So I finally found a. I have a screenshot of that monkey, so I don't know if I'm going crazy. That's an orangutan. They hang a tank guy. This is what it looked like. He, he was the president and it was some kind of animated or a muppet realistic muppet type alf type thing. Oh. So it Was a. Wasn't there wasn't a real. Do they use both? it sounds like when nbc went to 7:30 prime time, small, small wonder I think was there was nbc also my two dads. IT was nbc. Yeah. It seemed like. And they're all way worse than a regular sitcoms. Sitcoms. A shitty. Think what? Wouldn't have made it right here. I want to read this about the cannabis thing. Okay. Okay. There's the robert raich who wrote it. There's a widely held misconception that businesses in California medical

Speaker 6:          01:32:00       cannabis industry are prohibited from making a profit. In realiTy, no California law prohibits cannabis related businessman for making a profit. Opponents of metal pot. I'm going to translate as I read it. However, I've done a masterful job spreading disinformation since sb four. 20 was signed into law in 2003. The disinformation has become so prevalent that is affecting safe access to medical cannabis patients, blah, blah, blah. Okay, and is it resulted in state senator john, whatever releasing a letter debunking the why, the health medical reception, that part, that profit is not permitted for medical cannabis providers under California law. Looking at brian's moth, the giant moth,

Speaker 2:          01:32:38       he smoked and just moved. It's shit. Why would you smoke? Something that came out of that liquid looks so trippy that I'm like, I wonder if this would do anything. I mean, it didn't look like a fucking poison. It was probably poop or something. It's probably lit it anyway. Poison. It's probably it. You know what it is? It probably had had a miscarriage right there oN your floor. Yeah, I bet it was pregnant. I bet that was pregnant. Could be because they might look like to for two days. Yeah. Jesus christ. Brian, you got to die. It's not good. Whatever it is is not good. You have like one of those ports on trees where, where it goes over, we can stay in the room if you won't get what? Yeah. What did mouth love that? Here? It's finally talking today. Bob. Was both of those just downloading it this way?

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       Are those your balls? Huh? Oh, there's your balls. No, they're pretty. If they are, can you imagine if you got an operation to have your balls always in the shape of a heart. It was a new thing and women wanted you to do it. I show them that you really cared and yOu just get your balls tucked into a heart shape. Like they would. Uh, there was like a little plastic v implant that they would put in at the bottom of my heart. I always wanted to do it. I always want to wonder why, like belly buttons never got like, like getting an extended or Changed in any way. The balls are so vulnerable, but nobody would touch it. Sometimes they get bothered. Button rings, people, girls get an implant on your balls with like a wireframe. That was like in the shape of a heart.

Speaker 2:          01:34:06       Like those ladies dresses from the old days, but I had to pool from out. Yeah, they're just spread it Out like a bat. The bat wing over the balls and spread it out into your fucking balls are already super vulnerable. If somebody kicks you in the balls and you have an implant in their skin was even hurt anymore, but there's so much extra skin you can do stuff with them so much. Totally. Well, that's what we were talking about. The guy who got fucked to death by the horse. He had like a whole binder. A notebook binder. Yeah, of of rings. Why not? Of course it eventually will do that. People will put it in the shape of a heart. That'd be sweet. It'll be a cupcake maker. Get girls to suck on them. Swear you. You'd keep your hard drive ways. No, that's not true. Take your dick out. Suck on your balls will suck on your balls, period. The odds of it happening. Yeah. If a girl won't Suck on your balls, you really shouldn't be with her. I don't like it. I think it tickles. You got problems you, it doesn't take

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       all you at all. If a girl will suck on your balls. Oh my girlfriend loves it. That's basically polly's move. He would take it out. She'll do anything. Just take it out just as. Yeah. And it would say like, either they're going to do this or they're not. WE're going to find out right now. Yeah. But I mean, girl, you're dating. Oh, you didn't suck your balls. Some girls won't suck balls. They'll suck your dick. But there's a line they won't cross. There's girls that you can't come in their mouth. That's what she wants. A alley was walking by and um, and uh, we were pretending. I just had my balls out all the time, right at the store. Just all the time. Just had my dick and balls out and we're trying to get at the. Commits this one girl to like, no, it's totally normal.

Speaker 6:          01:35:36       They smell fine, you should just suck it. Oh, I remember this day and pretended like, oh really? Yeah. I said like she didn't know me and she was like, hey, what's going on? Uh, there's like, do you know this guy is like, know what's happening. I love the comedy store. It's so fun here. They were like, we're trying to explain like it's totally cool. Just these guys. They're like, oh yeah, maybe I'll do it like we're together and she says blowing outside and then she would just walk out as you're trying to convince this girl that is totally normal. Do you Have this on tape somewhere? It was so weird and no one got embarrassed for. Was like, yeah, she does it. She's with her. Of course, the girl said she was so confused by it. She's like, what is happening? It was really funny. This awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:36:19       Well, that's pretty much easy. Jesus. She's, oh no, no. Your ex's into jesus. You need to have her on a skeptic tank. Hold on, hold on, hold on. When was the last time you talked to her? We text sometimes text. What about in person? But it's been about a year and a half in that time she went to jesus. Jesus. How long ago did you break up to years? Three, four, four, four or five? No, it was, it was post the store. We, we just figured that out, right? That it's been five years since I went. I quit going to the store a sick. Well, 2007 was when I was in seventh. So it was a. Yeah, because when all that stuff happened, I had someone else that I think we'd already broken up by the. Wow. So it's a five years ago. Okay. So a year and a half ago she got into jesus, something like that.

Speaker 6:          01:37:07       I'm not good with time. Marijuana is definitely ruined that. Is that a guy? It's a guy that's. No, no, no. It's just like, you know, she didn't want to do whatever she was doing for people find that jesus. So then she started saying that you kind of a sermon with me and I'm like, stop, you know, it's all I can do. Dr mok you. But meanwhile she tried to get me to go. Really intelligent. That's weird. She was a very intelligent person, super smart people like like the jesus all the time. I don't quite get it. I will. I'll get her on that. There's a harder. They compartmentalize their logic is what it is and the idea behind it is great. The idea behind me, if it was real, god damn it, wouldn't it be beautiful? Wouldn't it be beautiful? They're really talking about need to find jesus. Have you found jeans? But they. They're not lying to you when they say that, it's because if you really do believe that there's more fulfilled guess, then it's

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       like, I'm happy for you if you're happy, but like she was in what she probably wasn't happy have, you know, a lot of girls who do like, they get wild and they like blow guys the comedy store in front of people, you know, like that kind of behavior, that kind of wild behavior. That's fun. If you'rE around people who think it's fun, but if you're not a you get judged by enough people who don't think that shit is funny and if you're the type of person does like wild shit and tries to be funny and has tries to have a good time and it was a little impulsive, people will fucking judge you and to the point where you start to think that your morals are really questionable and you're a fucked up person. You need to get your shit together and if you hear that enough and you don't have a support system, you, you'll crack more.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       Let me think about it. She's living with this guy. I mean you're my friend. You're here and everything like that, but you're a brilliant guy. Very, very intelligent, very educated, very well read and your around her all the time. So you were having intelligent conversations with her and if people don't have that in their life, if all of sudden they get cut off from that and everyone just telling you, dr. Death, morons, and you're around a giant swarm of moron influence and more on information. I was talking to people in minneapolis and they were like, what would you rather have a of virgin who's not good at sex or someone who's very good effect, but it had sex with a lot of people. I'm like, definitely the one that sucks. A lot of people were talking about sex with people and be like, yep, fine. That's fine. What are you talking about? Of course, who cares? We gas. What do you care? So silly. We get long season all diseased up. Oh yeah. Why don't she don't got a virgin? I'm teaching teacher. How did you like the virgin way? Teach them how to do stuff. She like,

Speaker 7:          01:39:37       I don't want you sweating. I feel bad like an unbeliever. I gave him.

Speaker 1:          01:39:48       Oh, they're going to Cry and talk. he's like a virgin and haley wasn't part of their deal. Yeah, you definitely want to go with the slot, but you don't want to go with the crying. Yeah. You know the problem with the girls had sex with a lot of people is a lot of times they feel bad about it or they've done it because there's some underlying issue. I think anyone I've been around a little bit is like, just seems like they're cool with sex. We'll have sex and we feel like having some of them. Some of them, yes and no. I'm just saying the occasional bomb, the occasional 110 that starts crying, ruins all the rest of fun. Girls. Look at advisor. She hates sex. She's talks about hoW she notes having sex to backers. Everybody wants to find out why does she hate it? I don't know. She's just as like a minute and a half. I'm done. I just wanted it to be to be over with. It seemed super uncomfortable about a lot of shit though. She's a strange girl. She's super aggressive, real competitive. Loves her dog. Hold onto the dog too much. She's really quick, real quick and aggressive at the ceremony on his birthday last night and she didn't have her dog so I'm like looking around interpersonal last night. Like regular clothes high. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       She changes in dress, dress down before she goes on stage. She has as a comic, she's want to get judged by anybody looking at or anything like that. She's got a great body, you put on a loose tee shirt and jeans and then she goes back to the car, gets into like nice clothes, attractive clothes, and then goes out with her. I love sending her pictures of just random black dicks actually react to that. She loves it. She loves it. She might be saving them up in a portfolio for when you start getting rich and she's going to fucking sue you. You're right about that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       I worry about that. One person I talked to him about sexual harassment if you just do it to a person, right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't man at this is this stupid, scared, loopy as fucking day in comics to comics. I think you're safe doing that, you would think, but I don't think it works that way. The employee handbook for the lawyer comedy store, it said like, uh, you cannot say anything of a racial manner to another employee. You cannot say anything of a sexual manner. And other employee it was like all these rules, but it goes, but then it goes. With that being said, you will hear from us stage some of the worst imaginable language from any human. That doesn't matter. You still can't act like that to other employees. You'll hear horribly thing saying, super racist, super sexist, like every night. Isn't that funny?

Speaker 2:          01:42:07       If you work there and you're like a waiter and you try to be as funny as the comedians, the tee shirt on. Yeah, you'd go to jail. They'll take eveRything. It'll lawsuit. Let's take everything that. Fuck you cnn. Here's an article, george clooney still open to marriage. Fuck. They'll open America today in west hollywood. What? Uh, thIs guy started. This is what I heard on the way here is I don't know what the full story, but the guy started, this guy started walking around these houses and I kicking people's doors in and yelling and then, uh, he kicked somebody door down and then caught the house on fire and shot three people. And I get 30 2:38 year old women and a 34 year old guy today. Explain that again. What happened? But he kicked sOmebody door down. he started kicking the door down like pneuMonia, melrose, and then he just started fucking shooting people and then cotsen house on fire, but they were still figuring it out while I was driving here and I go, wow, we don't know what's going on.

Speaker 2:          01:43:05       Wow. That guy in Utah let his kids on fire. No, he killed him with a hatchet and blew the house uP and then lit it on fire. They blew the house. Why I feel better about the he, it's horrific. I thought he just lit them all on fire after bernadette. It's terrible. What he did was they, a social worker came that was supposed to babysit him while he's with the kids supposed to be there, he's not supposed to have. And then they ran into the house. He grabs them, pulls them, and pushes the guy out, kills the kids with a hammer. The guy opens a door, is smells gas, and then the, uh, the guy who kills the kids with a hatchet rather blows up the house and kills all of them because if you can't have them, no one can. I don't knoW what the reason. He lost custody. He'd killed the wife. He killed. He had killed a white and he killed the wife and he was under suspicion of it and while he was under suspicion, they pornography

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       questionable pornography on his computer. I heard it was what it was was he didn't love his wife because he had worn. It was child porn, but it was animated. Was animated child porn. It's so weird. I didn't think they had. This is by the way, the third hand, third hand information. Do you have the jerry sandusky was trying to gain the right to go onto his back porch. Oh, he was going on his back porch and while he was there he was looking at an elementary school

Speaker 6:          01:44:21       in elementary school and that's where he lives. So we can look at an elementary school that wasn't even part of the beginning. Part of the story, right?

Speaker 1:          01:44:28       He's a monster. That guy's a fucking mom. He wants. He wants a chance to see his grandkids so we can have one more before it goes away. It's so crazy that that guy got as far as taste, when you hear him talk about it, it's scary. It's just the way he talked about it. Are you attracted to children? My attracted to children. That's how he answered that.

Speaker 6:          01:44:50       He didn't say no, no, no. Stop. No, no,

Speaker 1:          01:44:54       of course not. What I think he might be struggling with it really, really hard. Oh god. Really say that. Almost everybody that is in that sort of a situation. Yeah. Got molested when they were young. Yeah. That's how. That's how those people reproduce. Isn't that? That's their method of reproduction. Fucking crazy thing. He's nuts. That you can imprint that into a child's mind. you. I don't think it's 100 percent sure the space has moved on. There's a lot of people to get molested that don't wind up doing that and they, you know, it's like people who are around when their father beats their mother. Some people they grow up to beat their wife as well. It becomes. Or if your. If your parents beat you, you beat your kids and some of them it's the opposite way. They liked the snow land. It depends if you like it.

Speaker 1:          01:45:35       Like, like when I got molested by that babysitter I, she was totally and I loved it. That's totally different. You like what, how will they be like 10 or 11? And she was a chick and she was pretty and that was fun for me. I'm such a difference between a guy doing that to a little kid and a girl doing that to a little kid. Right. So I don't want some chick blowing my kids, you know, I wouldn't want to come home and some fucking hot chick is blowing a 10 year old boy. I wouldn't want to see that. That would be fucked up and you would have to call the cops and everything. But man, it would be the only thing that would be traumatic as the poor guy would probably be in love with her. You know, you know when you.

Speaker 6:          01:46:10       She's my favorite babysitter. Why can't you hire her anymore? She was telling other ones. Now I'm friends with her on facebook because I hunted her down. I want to marry her. I want to play older. Somebody put up a link, put up the link dog, show me a picture on your phone. Just don't show it to the camps and just tweet it. No one's going to care. People not sweet. It's like people on twitter are really cool. You can tweet it. Just a picture, but don't put her name now. I can't even do that shit too big nowadays. The shit out that bitch. What's her name? Hang on. I almost fucking. It sounded reasonable to and it came out of your mouth. I was like, yeah, like oh wait, no, that's really good. Just first and last name. Really

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       good at convincing people. Was the host of fear factor here, like it's way worse, which by the way is canceled forever. No, it got canceled again for real.

Speaker 1:          01:46:59       Oh, sorry. I'm sorry man. That's okay. It's good. I was 100 percent to horror like. Yeah. Thank you very much. I enjoyed the time. I enjoyed hanging out with all the fear factor people. There is a fucking awesome group of people, but I'd rather do my own thing even though it was great money. I'm not hurting for money. I'm all right. That's the only thing I feel bad for you for. It's like, oh yeah, it was, it was fun money. It was good. But the reality is I, I really, I enjoy working for the ufc and doing comedy 100 times more. It was, it was okay to do. It was fun. It was fun to be back with all the people. I loved all the people and work with them again. But you know, the difference between the enjoyment that you get of doing something that you've really loved doing the enjoyment was still a bad ass job as far as jobs go.

Speaker 1:          01:47:42       It was the fucking shit. I would never complain about it. I have in the past and it sounds really douchey. That's a problem. No one can really understand that. Understand that you get complacent with it. Like you start expecting kind of money once you get it. It was fun because the people that are working with were fun. And the cast of the, the uh, the brother, the contestants this year were awesome. There was a lot of great contestants, a lot of really fucking funny people. Really crazy people, but it is what it is and it's over the end. Apparently it was hard for them to get advertisers for it. Oh really? Damn. You should have heard that donkey one. Yeah, I got it on my phone. What is that? Oh, that's her. That's her babysitter. Yeah. Oh shit. Let me see

Speaker 5:          01:48:22       what it also does. Some sunglasses indoors. She has a desk. Yeah. Oh, that's her now. Yeah. That's not bad. That's not bad. Where's she live looking thin. Midwestern. I say. Yeah, it was western. Did you catch that in the midwest? That's totally fine. That's great dude. She's like a black belt in karate or something like nice kick your ass and yeah, she has a nice family now and yeah, the kids. Yeah. That's my. No. Do you have a bit about it? Yeah, because I see it friday night at what time to show shows that 10:00 and go to the ice house comedy dot. You go. I'm going to be there on the lineup. Moshe, moshe is gonna be their dj deadpan from tim and eric. I'm going to try to get on barker

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       to come down as well because he just said that he's there friday night until monday afternoon. Maybe I'll get him to come around and we'll do a podcast with him before the icehouse. Awesome. Smart. Yeah, and from Australia for till monday. Said monday. I'm an icehouse chronicles, if you will. We do is the ice house shows are some of my favorite shows ever. The standup shows and the podcast shows we do. We have a studio in the ice house in pasadena. It's a separate room and what we do is we start the show and we started a podcast just a little bit before the show and then people just run back and do a set and then come back and hang out. So fucking best

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       hamburg. It's hard. It's so fun. The last one I got so fucking high from that weed. That's awesome. I, I was shaking and then brody was supposed to be out in front for me. He's like, I can't. Brody said like, I can't go up and I'm like, you're king high. And I'm like, I've never been to stone before. And I had to go up, I was forced to go up and say had the best that I've ever had in my life. Oh, you can go. Totally worked. It worked. Or was it like that time in her life she had destroyed the support. She kept saying she got high and wrote it and she was like, that sounds awesome. It was definitely the best. What's the next morning? It was a terrible report. It wasn't joe. Who is the rich girl. Not purity. Blair blair. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:50:28       Yeah. It was. It was kind of hot button. Three words per page. She was a little chubby but hot. She had to fight it. I'm sure they had network heads. Listen, you need to eat less right now. But she was a good kisser probably. She kiss you like you ice cream. Oh god. I gotta watch that show again with with them in mind is just young, young women. Dirty boarding house. And how much were they fucking on the side? Probably a bunch toward. For a woman who was in a position like that where they become like super, super successful, it's probably hard for them to find mates if a woman is making a ton of money, like a jennifer aniston type woman. She's dating something like regular dude now. Right? Isn't she date? And some like regular guy. It's hard to get someone to looking at you as a regular person.

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       Yeah. It takes a long time. Well, not only that man. I think for women it's like a normal thing for the man to be more successful than the woman. Yeah. And when the woman is like way more successful than the man, I think it gets sketchy. Yeah. You know, I was in some way to your room at some of something like tennis or something. And uh, I saw a magazine with one hot chick from, um, not the 100 proof from the desperate housewives, the one he's been superman, lois and superman. Oh, the fake. Even not even the glory of the one who is just slightly less hot that eva longoria. Oh, tara. Tara hatchet teri hatcher. Terri hatcher. Geriatric care was waY hotter. We ended up getting a taro patch in where it would be a shit if they just put her on one of those shows, but she said from now on, she's like, she's not going to look like herself.

Speaker 2:          01:51:54       Pay for a date. She still expects everyone to pay realize. Yeah, because that's hoW it works. What? No, that's ridiculous. She's worth like $100. What do you mean you have so much more money than me? Just pay for it. Yeah. No, I mean you have to pay for it. You have to buy her dinner and then beg for sex, you know, and then you know, it's just probably not India anyway, so probably not. Yeah. You would have to be like some brad pitt to over stimulate a woman like that. Oh yeah. You'd have to be like someone's even more famous than her, or even more powerful than her. I mean, I would think you would say no. Mean people tell you you fucking ridiculous. Your point of view is stupid. It's asinine. There is a certain chimpanzee, logical. They want someone to do that to them.

Speaker 2:          01:52:35       They want an alpha. They want sometimes some people, even the ones that don't matter, how long do they last? Like our friend for instance, who will remain nameless, who recently left his girl who also remain nameless, and he was in the beta position during the entire relationship. I knew. I'm like, this shit ain't gonna work. How the fuck is this going to work? Women like that alwaYs complained that the dude does it. The other ones don't work. Either those ones will have Better relationships, but he was. The alpha doesn't worK either. Then was he ever the. I don't know what he talking about. How dare you? I've never seen that. Turn around.

Let me headline the headline. That's awesome dude. Addison texts and this is the shit addison apparently was the one city, uh, in dallas back in the olden days where you could drink. Oh, rose wides, wild. It's like really was during prohibition. They used to have weird laws about the city of dallas, but addison was where you can go to drink and smoke. Remember, I think you might still be able to smoke in the club. It might be one of the last places that maybe they changed that.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       I hope they didn't. Even though I hate cigarettes, I also like personal freedom. Yeah, that's the problem. That's the one where the fringe. Not other people. Yeah, so we're stinky. Well, the real issue is for work. They're stinky, but it's also. There's something about girls that smoke there, sluttier. She'll just know that they make decisions that just don't matter. Yeah, they're crazy bitches. They're throwing cigarettes out the window and they don't even thinking about where it goes in to sign. The chevron addict down their mouth. The loads go off. They're not thinking about what's going in there. They're not thinking about that sticky dick. They just send out a hundred percent of the time. It helps your odds. It increases the odds of finding a way to actually see a girl with red nail polish and she's chewing gum and she spits her gum out into the bushes and then lights a cigarette.

Speaker 2:          01:57:16       That girl might suck dick. I said, what are we doing later? That girl might be crazy. She's not thinking about shit. She's just living for momentary little blips of thrills. If you're interested in coming to the ice house, go to, what is it? Ice house comedy.com. And search for joe rogan. Where? Death squad? Yes. Stage two. Stage two, because that's what we're doing. And matt in march, we're going to do a fuckload dates there because I'm going to be around. Most of them are mr. Fear factor. I think you're off the fact. Forgot about that girl. That girl in the last monster. You're going to tell you friends having something with our friend aside. A little accent is just so bad and while they were doing it, she was going again. Italia France. You got to tell you a friend. Yeah. He told us this because it was gross.

Speaker 2:          01:58:10       He told us the opposite. That liKe he was a stud. I'm bragging, I'm pillows. how sad it was. Harry is sobering up. Well, he's half hard inside of her and she's going again. I know I saw a girl walk across That. That old. What was it? Old room, but they don't have any more connection. Connection and she was super hot. Walked all The way across the room, like outside there was like, whoosh, just looking right at me and she just comes over. She was one of the bathroom, but she stopped and came to me. She goes, Yeah, well pesi funny or whatever. Crap, go. Piss off. Wicked has killed it all. You just teach her to talk different. She'd be fine. Yeah, you can do that though. Wouldn't have the patience to do that. You know, that girl used to from Texas? Uh, jessica, she, she would like have the thickest.

Speaker 2:          01:59:00       When I first met her at the thickest accent, it was just like, all y'all sound like she was a hillbilly, that she moved to la, completely lost it and then move back. But when she went home to visit it came back a little stronger. I would have asked her to keep it. I love that accident. Texas oxidants. My favorite was a real women. Those are women, you know what I mean? They like want to be women. They don't want to be president and they want to be running shit. They like to be in women. The man, the areas where the men are manly, like who's manlier than Texas dudes, you know, it's like big belt buckles and fucking trucks in the. Mainly those are the women, the women you know. Whereas you get to san francisco, you get chicks and one a fucking stuff, a birkenstock up your ass scream at you because you know you don't want to give them the right to choose.

Speaker 2:          01:59:42       Obviously these are generalizations, generalizations. We're just talking here. It's impossible for girls in Texas even roll their eyes really well either. Just so laid back. Go to higher primate.com. If you're interested in monkeys and weed and psychedelics. That's my teacher at line. Brian's reminded me. He's right and you need sales to sales or coupons for that. Okay. I'll get a coupon stuff that you're not going to sell much more around for awhile. You got to keep on asking me this. You need to make a coupon code. You know what bands deal. This is why my new thing. I think you should do it as a teacher of the year every year. Some new design. Oh, that's a good idea. You know, because they had the old last year, his teacher that's 50 percent off. You know, we should do. We should do a jo rogan experience podcast tee shirt by this dude, which worldwide sweatpants, whatever the fuck his name is.

Speaker 2:          02:00:29       Foremost sweat pants, sweatpants. That's not like Mike Maxwell, but maxwell did a great job with the chicago posters to have this guy. Awesome guy do it to a tee shirt, but like, that's not a bad idea. What should it be on it? The death Squad cat. Tired of that. Capra. especially when you changed. I'm just going to change them just to fuck monkey todd over. I changed it because those guys would have the tattoo you marketing tool. That's why I said like, hey, I'm going to get a tattoo. I'm like, don't do that. I'm what? Don't fucking build heroes out of nowhere. Well, it's cool. It's like you old marvel logo. It's kind of hipper. The old cat. ExactlY. Yeah. A marketing. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:01:15       Delicious with, with, with. What's it called? Rum. Cherry rum. Oh, what is it? Shirley temple with cherry rum in it. And so at first we called it surely period, but then we thought that just wouldn't catch on enough. So he called temple of doom way. Yeah, exactly. So now it's just going to be, hey, you know what they originally called this. Oh, this will be part of the folklore. And so that's a drink that they sell the store now you. Yeah. Oh that's cool. So you only the front bar would know about it and I guess the backbar. Well if you order it though, someone could ask some of the more there if you're working. Yeah. And they get order. Probably anytime the front bars up on. they'll know now everybody knows now. Do you get like a copyright on that already? Just some satisfaction of knowing you have something to do with it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:58       That'd be bad aSs. We were in vegas a couple of years from now. We were at temple of doom and everybody knew what it was.
