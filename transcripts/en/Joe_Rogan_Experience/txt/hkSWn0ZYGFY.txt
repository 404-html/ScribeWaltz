Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, that's an interesting way of doing it. Are you completely opposed to legalization?

Speaker 2:          00:06          No, no, no. I mean I am not completely opposed to legalization. Mind concern here is that the country are too ignorant right now for legalization. Not that people will go out and do some dangerous things related to drugs, but if you legalize drugs now, what will happen is that you will have the detractors say things like, any ills in our society is going to be blamed on a drug. We are so ignorant. We're susceptible to believing that. So before legalization I'm arguing that we have this increase in education about what drugs do and don't do, do so people cannot be susceptible to being hoodwinked like that. I'm arguing that the education provides an inoculation, if you will.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So you're saying we can handle the truth essentially. What are you saying is that we need this decriminalization step before we get to a legalization, that it's the. We couldn't just jump right into legalization. It will be too much change. Pandemonium. People go crazy. Fear. People would use propaganda to set people against the, you know, to go against it.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Yeah, so I'm thinking about, well, I'm not saying it'll be pandemonium. We have Washington and Colorado right now. Mark my words. There will be studies coming out of Washington and Colorado showing that young people in those states do more poorly on whatever measure you want to have as a result of marijuana. The studies, the data won't support that conclusion, but that's what people are going to be drawing from those data. And so I'm. This is my prediction right now as a result of people's ignorance about marijuana and that's that's marijuana. A drug that we have a lot more experienced in with heroin and, but mark my words, you'll see those steps come up

Speaker 3:          01:51          and they religions have a way of prosecuting psychedelic losers are losers say users throughout history, but they would call it the work of the devil and that's what I ran into with the Mazda text who I was working with up in Wahaca, is that they had to. When the Spaniards came, they had to flee into the hills to continue the mushroom tradition. And now you'll actually see, um, I went to San Jose, Delpha Civica, one town where the mushrooms are readily accessible in this other town, what La de Jimenez and you'll see on the churches they have Jesus and Mary and then on the other side they have a mushroom, so they actually worship the mushrooms. They've kind of mixed, I guess to survive. They mixed Catholicism in with their worship of these mushrooms and um, it's, it's pretty trippy per se to see it painted on these churches. That's actually

Speaker 1:          02:40          a big part of really ancient religious artwork, period. You know, a lot of, if you look in, look up, do some research on the connection between mushrooms and even the Catholic Church. There's mushroom iconography all over the place and really ancient descriptions like one of the earliest depictions of Adam and Eve on some ancient fresco is Adam and eve with a mushroom tree in between them. Have you ever seen that image? See if you can pull that up. Jamie, Adam and eve mushroom picture and we'll find the description of it. Uh, and eve mushroom. Yeah. We just lost track of all this stuff. It's also one of the reasons, yeah, this is. It's right away. You could pull up that image. It's pretty intense. That's a. that's an image of Adam and eve. I mean, look at that.

Speaker 3:          03:28          That's crazy. The mushroom. That's fucking crazy. It was really strange for me when I was in Mexico to see them blessing the mushrooms on the altar a instead of the communion holy water, they give you mushrooms and that's your sacrament. That's what you eat. There's another one,

Speaker 1:          03:43          Jamie, pull up. There's the other, another one that's a different image, but a very, very similar image. See that one on the far left. Far Left. Yeah, right there. Click up that one.

Speaker 4:          03:52          Look at that.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Isn't that trippy? That's from 1147. They call it ce now. They don't call it a d anymore for whatever reason, but that's from 1147. So they knew even back then about psychedelic plants having some sort of a connection to Christianity and these were, you know, these are from churches. So it's, um, it's really fascinating. That's just something that went away

Speaker 5:          04:19          even before I ever went incident Jujitsu philosophy. I fought a tough man contest when I was 18 years old. Mr t was the referee. I swear to God it was a video that I have. Video was on entertainment tonight. Show a clip of me with a Mohawk. So you had three guys. I fought all heavyweight day, day one 75 minutes. I will have my clothes on. And I was, I was, I was, I was like, I was brown that weight by one 75 at all. So, uh, I fought three guys. I knocked out two guys, man, the second guy took. Dude, how about that? Tough man experience was the worst head trauma than all my fights combined. How about that? Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. Wow. I had a concussion like you wouldn't believe I've never get through to this day. You want to get grossed out in case you didn't hear it at home.

Speaker 5:          05:10          Kids. Oh my God, that's nothing. That's my joy. That goes from the tough was my. I fought one guy and he was a day. It's funny because they put it, the two small guys together. So they put me verse this guy, he's fucking scarred for life now. It was me versus this. Ah, they, they, they announced me as a weight lift in pizza boy from long island because I delivered pizzas and my buddy at the time, Jim mccluskey, he was a professional boxer. Me and him, we got into a ton of street fights together. But uh, he used the items for the day, my life. But I used to fight a lot. He got it looks stand like this, you less of a target as it. That's why he, that was my lesson. So, uh, so I, I went in there, I didn't know what the fuck do you expect?

Speaker 5:          05:53          No head gear, just these big gloves on that guy who runs it, whatever his name was. Beard. Yeah, I believe, I don't know. I guess so. But uh, they put me in verse, this platoon leader from Desert Storm and this guy, he's from long island to. I didn't know. And uh, I ended up fucking drilled him so I, I fucking hammered them and they stopped it right away. That clip. I can get it. It was on it. I got it on tape. I get, I get, I can get it to you. I think you'd be. Want to see it. It's funny because they showed it on it, that statement tonight and I'm like, ah, that's great. Mary or whoever it is making a face. But Mr t was the referee. I thought it was amazing.

Speaker 6:          06:28          You're a smart dude because I was just at this tech conference, uh, and we as ceos and this thing and we were talking about it and I, we got into a fight with one of these big dudes or an old dude, big powerful guy. And he said, you know who, who, who wouldn't, jails. Snowden. I said, me, I wouldn't tell them what's the difference between snowden and Woodward and Bernstein, Woodward and Bernstein and the presidential papers, like they were the punks of their generation like, but now they're heroes because it's the baby boomers and Snowden's fuck you. It's what's good for the goose is good for the Gander. Anyway, we got into this fight. What's he, what's his argument? You know, he was just, he's bad and has the same argument. No, he's not, he's weakened country, a trader, I'd kill myself in front of them.

Speaker 6:          07:15          And so and so, so we got into this fight, but, but uh, you know, the interesting thing about that is a, the fact that a lot of people, you know, whistleblowing is seen as eye. I see it as, as that's what's going to keep democracy safe, but this sort of overreaching and I said, look, you know, I didn't come to America for it to be able to live in a police state and this is the definition of a police state is that they could watch everything that we do and that it was all these tech guys in the tech guys just sort of rolled their eyes and said it's already happened. The tech is already there. The, the government has already made the deals. It's a de facto thing. You can't change it. And then, then I got kind of worried because you're exactly right. You're 100 percent right. The tech is so pervasive that you can't fuck with it.
