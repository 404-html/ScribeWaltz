Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is the first time he's ever had a false darn. He's getting tricky. That's real. That's real world live. Shane. Dorian, how are you brother? What's going on? Great. Thanks. Thanks for doing this, man. I really appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. I'm happy to be here. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. You know, um, you come highly recommended by my friend Ben O'brien, who's an awesome dude. And apparently you guys had a great time in New Zealand. Bowhunting. Yeah, he's very, he's very Texas. Yeah. Yeah. We had a really good old time down there. I'd never been to. I'd never been to New Zealand for hunting before. I'd been there for surfing, so it was really cool to go and see different parts of the country and do some hunting out there. We did some back country stuff surfing there. Is it as dangerous as surfing in Australia?

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       As far as like sharks a? No, not as dangerous. I'd say. You know, there are, there are sharks there. It's pretty close to Australia. It's like a one hour flight. So yeah, that's what I was thinking sharks here or over there, but I don't, I don't know. I don't really think of sharks as as much. There's no, you have a yellow, a total radical fear of sharks are scary, scary creatures. And then I'm fucking horrified. How close have you shouldn't be. You shouldn't be. Um, very close. Yeah. I got bumped off my board when I was a kid. Oh No. Surfing into a place. A sort of near my house, but the water was that the sand was black. So yeah, like I can really see the is actually clear, but the Sam is black, so it bumped me and I never really got to see what it was.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       But I'm pretty sure it was a shark and A. There's a lot of sharks in Hawaii, a lot of sharks, wherever the waves are good. It seems like there's a lot of sharks, man. Yeah. That's not a coincidence, is it? I don't know, man. They're just everywhere. They're crazy. As you know. It's funny about sharks. As I was growing up, I always thought, you know, the only real sharks I had to worry about where, you know, great whites and you know, I was born and raised in Hawaii, assess where I grew up surfing and um, you know, I always thought like great white sharks, they're always in really cool places. I don't really have to worry it around home and they've been finding a ton of great white sharks around where I live now. They're all over Hawaii now and I'm a great white sharks are actually warm blooded so they can actually, they can totally adjust their, their, uh, I guess I guess their body temperature to be able to, to totally survive and thrive in warm water as well as cold.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       So they just go wherever the hell they want. Every time I go to Hawaii, whatever, I turn on the news, the local news. Some dude got bit. Oh yeah, yeah. How often does it happen? They're pretty often. There's a lot of sharks. And you know, what's funny is it never used to happen when I was a kid. It wasn't even really a thought for me. I mean, I was scared of sharks and all that stuff, but people didn't really get start getting chomped until I was a little bit older in the last, in the last 10 years, there's been tons and tons of shark attacks in Hawaii. A friend, a friend of mine and Bethany Hamilton, she's a really, really talented surfer. She got bit. She had her arm chomped right off her body for a young girl. Yeah. Yeah. And Hawaii surfing perfect waves out with their friend and shark came up and just ripped her arm right now for body gangsters.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       She, that she just gets right back on the board and she survived. She's bad ass. She's super bad ass. She, she actually served some of the biggest waves, uh, all year. Last year she got towed into a place called Jaws on Maui and surfing 50 foot waves with one arm, um, you know, getting pounded by giant waves and she, she paddles into some huge ways with one arm. Wow. And gets held under water with one arm and magic magically held under from a, a giant wave underwater, you know, like trying to, you know, just, I mean, I know people who are terrified of surfing big waves with two arms and you know, they're under water wanting a breath and she's under there with one arm. Imagine having like your arm tied to your side and having to try and swim to the surface the way it is. Pretty scary.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Now when you get hit by a big wave like that and you get sucked under, how long are you under normally for a, usually a pretty, pretty short amount of time. But it really varies. Um, you know, the, the, the worst thing about surfing really big waves and the, we've had a lot of people die surfing big waves and it is super dangerous. Um, the thing that kills people is getting held under for two waves. So if you fall on, it's like if you take off on a wave and you fall and you're underwater for a super long time. And this has happened to me a couple of different times. You're underwater really far and then you start, you know, the wave hold you under and it's rolling you along the reef towards the shore and you're underwater near the bottom or at the bottom and then the waves just starts to dissipate and lose a little bit of power and he can finally start swimming up and then the next wave is meanwhile it's on its way and you're swimming up, swimming up and the waves coming at you and you don't get a breath in.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       The wave takes you straight back down and that. And that's how people die. Yeah, it's scary shit. So how long have you been held under? For about a minute and 10 seconds. It's a long time. The only reason I know that is because a, I had a terrible wipe out at a, at a big wave place in northern California called Mavericks. It was my first trip ever there and I was having this awesome trip. It's like, you know, it's one of the best big waves in the world. I always wanted to go there, but I was pretty scared of it and I ended up going there and having a. The first day I was there, it was super good. I had a, I had a blast. I didn't fall once. I had to just it with like a dream session, cuddle these big waves. Thought I was killing it next day, just absolutely smashed me.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       I took it off on a wave, ate shit down the face, got sucked over the falls, held under forever on the reef and was swimming towards the surface and the next day it was like a 50 foot face broke right on top of me, shoved me straight back down to the reef. And like, as I was swimming up to try and get a breath, I was doing those involuntary, you know, when you're going like that. And I was like, shit, I got to get a breath now. And then all of a sudden I was at, at the bottom. And um, yeah, it was really scary. But the scariest, scariest time of my life. And, and, and, um, meanwhile, meanwhile there was a woman on a boat and she was filming the whole ordeal. My board was like, they call it tomb stoning where you can only see half your board and then you're, and there's a leash, right? And you're connected to the bottom. And a was like this, you know, you can only see half the half the board for the next wave passed me by and my board was still like that for over a minute and I was like a minute and 10 seconds at a way, way too long.

Speaker 2:          00:06:10       Wow. That's, it's hard to hold your breath for a minute. Just doing nothing. Yeah. It is holding your breath for a minute while you're struggling. And also your adrenaline's kicking in. You're freaking out. Yeah. And you're realizing that you got to get some air soon.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       Oh yeah. Yeah. And that's when, you know, I mean, that's the whole thing is, is uh, you know, learning about breath, hold the whole thing that speeds up your, your, your, your breath. Hold is, is uh, or I should say shortening your breath. Hold is panicking. You know, once you, if you're able to stay, stay calm and know that you're going to be okay, you know, you don't use up your breath very, very fast, but if you start to panic it's like it's like flooring the gas and it just speeds up the whole thing. And um, so panicking is lasting that you want to do, but when you're really terrified, that's what happens to everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       There's a big connection between Jujitsu and surfing. A lot of people that I know that Love Jujitsu also love surfing and they do it all the time. And um, that breath thing is something that comes into play in both situations because if you're in a bad position, like if someone's choking you or something like that, you can relax and stay calm and kind of barely get out of things. Whereas if you freak out and you start, you start hyperventilating or panicking, you just, you just have to tap, you run out of gas, you run out of air. And then the choke sinks in deeper in. Some people are just really good at surfing and for some reason that like Hicks and Gracie is a famous example, he's really good at Yoga, which is also really big for controlling your breath and staying calm and regulating your heart rate. And then he's also obviously a master at Jujitsu, but he loves surfing and I think in some way those things are kind of connected that you have to sort of maintain some sort of control over your physical body.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       Yeah, for sure. And you know, and you know, I think um, you know, knowing, knowing how long you can hold your breath, I'm especially under pressure, especially with a high heart rate is the key. You know, I, I, I did a breath holding course. It was like a, it was actually a specifically tailored to surviving big waves. Uh, this course I did was four days long and the first couple of days they just, they just kind of taught us with the science behind breath, hold on, how to get your breath, hold up. And then they basically, uh, worked our way up to our highest static hold. And then from there we had to hold our breath for a quarter of that time under stress.

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       Hm. So when you take a breath hold course, like what are they teaching?

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Uh, just the science behind the how, how some people can hold their breath for a long time and some people can't. And you know, the difference, the, it's, it's, it's basically psychological. It's all in your mind really? Oh yeah. It definitely is. I mean, if you think you can hold your breath for like if right now you tried to hold your breath for and you could only make it a minute for sure. You can hold your breath for 300 percent. It's all in your mind. Like if you believe that you are going to be fine, it just, you know, your body tells you that you need to breathe. I'm like, Kinda for that course. I think the first day I tried to hold my breath, I'm and I'm in relatively good shape and I never ever practice holding my breath at all. But you know, pretty good lung capacity because I was training all the time, especially at that time, the longest I could hold my breath. That first day was like two minutes and 15 seconds or something like that. And then by date, the end of the day three, I was holding it for five minutes and 34 seconds.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       Whoa, that's crazy. So it's just techniques and understand the technique. What is the world record wasn't a w, what's the fucking magician guy? Didn't he break the world record like 17 minutes or something like that. But yeah, some weird where it sucked in pure oxygen or something. Cheating bullshit is night and day. Yeah. You can't do this twice. I, I think it gives you like,

Speaker 1:          00:10:02       um, from, from what I, I think that's about twice as long as, as like a world record holder can actually hold their breath. I think he was packing oxygen is totally different. He's breathing up with pure oxygen for like a long time. And it totally, uh, you know, it's basically like, it like doubles your breath hold.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       Yeah. There it go. Seventeen minutes and four point four seconds. Bad Ass. It's pretty incredible. Even with the oxygen

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       I. Yeah, I mean no matter how, how, how you slice it, that's a long ass time to not breathe.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       So he held the record for oxygen assisted static apnea between holding your breath while breathing after breathing pure oxygen. That would be super handy for my job. Pure oxygen, being able to hold your breath for 10 minutes. Fuck yeah man. You'd be like, fuck these waves, these waves and got shit on them, but I'm just going to swim to the bottom and kick it. Have you seen that product that they came up with? It's a bullshit fake product, but apparently people have spent like a million dollars on this thing trying to buy it. It's a fake. Like a gill machine. They came up with this thing that allows you to breathe. It's total bullshit. It's fake, but there was like these ads saying that allows you to breathe underwater and it looks like like a scuba mouthpiece, but it's just got like. It looks like two tampons on each side and this stupid thing doesn't work at all. It doesn't do anything, but apparently it's this giant scam and there was this article about how people have spent like all this money on this fake thing that doesn't even exist. It's crazy what people are right there. It's absolutely nuts. What people will actually buy. This oxygen masks allows underwater breathing without oxygen tanks, but it's total bullshit, so I don't understand where the money went or how it see if you could find an article of like what the fuck went wrong, but a bunch of to be like sucking oxygen out of the ocean.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       Yeah, like how ridiculous is that? Like people thought that they were fish. Oh yeah, that's all you need is this thing. You breathe in through those and you pull off to that, but it's a total scam. It's the order. In the next 59 seconds, we're going to throw a second one in for half of the price. Yeah, exactly. I mean it would be cool if someone could come up with something like that, but that's just not how it works. It is bizarre though that there are things that breathe air out of the water. They can find a way to suck air out of the water, like, yeah, life is very bizarre if you look at it that way. Very bizarre. And then you pull them onto the deck of the boat and they're like, yeah. And then you put us under water. The opposite. We start panicking immediately.

Speaker 4:          00:12:35       So the shark thing, what did they tribute it to? Anything. The reason why they're inviting more people lately. Yeah, it's super debatable though, you know, like a global warming type thing. Yeah. There's all types of stuff like that. There's, you know, there's a lot less fish than it used to be. And then the other thing is, you know, the thing I think is a, is a huge component is, is that going to sixties, if someone got bit, they would do a short call, like they, like people will get pissed, you know, some little girl get bit and then all the fishing boats to go out and kill a ton of sharks. And that's what happened in Hawaii. You know, there was, I think in the sixties there was, there was some shark attacks and um, there was a huge shark cold, like people would just go out and kill as many sharks they could.

Speaker 4:          00:13:14       And so it decimated the shark populations in Hawaii and then, and then they were, and then they were protected in the seventies and eighties. So now there's this mega shark shark population because they're protected, you know, you're not really supposed to kill sharks. So there's an over abundance of big sharks. I wonder if people would be the same if there was dragons, would we protect dragons? We're, we're required. We really are retarded for sure. We would hundred percent like, you're not going to wipe out the fucking sharks folks. Just relax. Skill kill them all around where people are. Yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy that they figured out like, you know, any technology for every single thing, but they don't have some sort of, you know, I was, I was thinking it'd be so, you know, with, in this day and age, like we can do the craziest shit with technology.

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       Like why can't they put buoys around a surf break with like some weird magnetic thing that shoots down to the bottom of the ocean at that, you know what it's like 30 feet deep, you know, like half a mile out from the break and then everyone can swim there. Everyone can serve their whatever the hell it is. Like how come they don't have. That seems so basic. It does seem like something they could figure out how to do like some sort of an electronic fence that keeps them out. Like they have that for your dog. Yeah. Can put that on your yard and the dog can't go past it. But it'll probably give you dick cancer. You know, they'll probably find out, you know, all these surfers and start getting Dick Cancer. And everybody went, what the fuck off the fence. The fence. Every cat. Yeah. Can put up the magnetic fence because all the sharks, all the sharks or get cancer and then yeah, for Sharks get Dick Cancer. Then Peta would get upset. He came over to

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       become a huge issue. I'm not a fan of sharks. I don't like them. They scare the fuck out of me and that's what's keeping me from surfing. Surfing looks like it's fucking awesome. I see guys like you on those big waves. If I don't know about the big ways that that's beyond me. I believe it. Even when I was young, I don't think I ever like this, this kind of shit that's not. I'm not designed for that. It's not fun looking. Nope, that's not me. We're looking at a fee for people who are listening will look at an image. Is that you? Who's. Who is that? That's me. Well, Jesus, dude, tell me about this. Looks like I'm falling off the building. Falling off several buildings stacked on top of each other. That, that, that

Speaker 1:          00:15:32       actual number right there. I actually felt like I was falling off a building. I was absolutely sure I was eating shit right there. So. And you didn't. Um, I didn't. Yeah, it was a miracle. I actually fell from the top and landed on my board and made the wave. And there's a big wave at a, at a wave, uh, off the north coast of Maui called jaws. Now, how high is that wave? Probably 50 feet on the face, maybe, maybe more. Maybe 60.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       So you're falling off the top of the wave, like it breaks and you're coming over the lip or the, what would you call it? What do you call the edge of the wave?

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm falling from the lip. But the cool thing is you're doing it with your hands. You know, like you're doing it with your bare hands. Like this wave comes in and you have to read the wave. You have to time it, you have to position yourself so you have to catch it in the steepest part right before it throws over like that because he could throw it over you eat and shit. So you know, you gotta it's just, it's so precise, you know, it'd be able to tighten it on a giant wave like that. Especially like the bigger the wave is, the faster it moves. So it gets really, really technical and so you know, a few successfully ride one of those ways. It's a lot of fun.

Speaker 2:          00:16:37       I would imagine. It gets super addictive when you're in that tube. And you're slicing through it and you see the water. Oh yeah. Going over the top of you. Yeah, it is. It is

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       so much fun. It's like, um, it is, it's such a blast. It's, um, it's super addicting. I, you know, I've been surfing since I was, I've been surfing on, on a surfboard standing up since I was five on my surfboard from my dad. And um, I'm still totally obsessed with it. It's weird. There's nothing else in my life like that where I'm absolutely psyched. Like when the waves are good, I'm, I'm like a little kid still. What is it about it, dude? It's like, it's like hunting. It really is. It's like I'm out in nature. No one's bothering me. I don't need to talk to anybody. I can go do my own thing. I can go down the beach no matter how shitty of a day I had, no matter how much stress, whatever, like if my kids getting a bad report card or I had to pay my taxes or whatever the hell it was, I can put on my trunks, dragged down to the beach, grab my board and I'm good. I'm soon as I hit the water, I'm fine and it. And that's how I am a bowhunting and people who don't bowhunt, they don't understand that. They're like, why the hell would you do that? Like what do you, what do you find, you know, like, what do you find good about that? Like being out in the forest for days at a time. It's the same thing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       Well obviously I've never served, but the bowhunting thing is so difficult and so primal and I think it hits some weird ancient switches inside your dna from back when people needed a bow and Arrow to survive. And when you were hunting an animal it. I mean it's, it's also, it's so primitive. Like there's something about rifle hunting that's not nearly as satisfying. Rifle hunting is. It's all exciting and it's, it's way more effective and you certainly have you. You'll have more success and there's more range to it, but it's not nearly the same feeling. There's a switch that goes off that I think is like a part of being a human being from the thousands of years of us shooting bows and arrows at things to stay alive. That, that, that reward is like triggered somehow or another deep inside. Whatever it is that makes you a person.

Speaker 1:          00:18:35       Yeah, it is. I mean it's, you know, it all comes down to the moment of truth that you worked so hard for that opportunities, whatever it is and elk or deer or whatever the hell it is and, and you bust your ass and you're on your hands and knees in the hot sun or you know you're over there freezing your ass off in the dark waiting for. They get to get light and a pack your shit from the trail head for miles and all this hard work and all the thousands of arrows. You shoot your target and all of a sudden it comes down to this this millisecond where the elk stops in front of you and you're sitting there full, drawn and it's like the moment of truth, you know, it's super technical and really difficult and a lot of people suck at it and that's why it's so rad.

Speaker 2:          00:19:11       Yeah, it's very technical and that is something that I just never took into account when I saw people shooting bows and arrows. Like, oh, he left arm straight. You right on pulls back. You make sure you aim, you let it go and seems like Kinda like a rifle, you know, with a rifle. What do you do? You sent her the radical, you know, you squeeze the trigger and make sure you don't jerk it. You're good. Yeah. There's so much more involved in the anchoring of where the string hits the corner of your mouth, where your hand rest below your jaw, making sure that your elbows not too low, not too high, your back muscles are pulling

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       and remembering all that stuff in the moment. Yeah, and getting to full draw. That is the hard part. That's the big difference, you know, I mean that's, I mean that's the main difference is once that animal's in range, you still have to get to full draw. Yeah. And you're not sitting there like this wedding without making any motion. You actually have to go full draw and somehow do that undetected without the animal getting alert or freaked out or running away. Yeah. It's a crazy little addiction, isn't it? It is very, very crazy. And it's also, I was, my wife would agree with you.

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       Mine went to, um, I was watching a video of you, uh, you were grilling some steaks, some, uh, I think it was access deer at your house. And you, when you were talking about it like this, like the connection that you have to your food, like you went and you found that animal, you know, that is a wild animal. That animal was just living like they'd been living for hundreds of thousands of years. Just eating grasses and staying away from predators. Snuck up on it and you place an hour right

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       in his vitals perfectly and cut it up and brought it home. And now you're eating it and there's this insane connection to your food when you do something like that. Yeah. Well, especially when you look around, your family's eating in like my key. I have little kids and they're sitting there with deer on their fork eating it. Like Dad brought this home is awesome. I think it's cool. You know, like I dunno, I, there's just something so much more satisfying about eating food that you grew or killed or whatever it was. You know what I mean? I, it's, it's, it's so cool. When someone has an awesome garden that their house, they busted their ass and they'd know exactly where that food came from. It only touched their hands. You know, it's the same thing and it's even, it's even more so when you're, when you spend all that time in the mountains and, and you know, you bring it home and you care for that meet and make sure it's not dirty and make sure it's not spoiled and make sure it's taken care of perfectly.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       Like you'd go in my, in my freezer and I'm like a total. I'm a, I'm actually kind of a slob and a lot of like different areas of my life, like I don't make my bed a lot of times or whatever it is, but now when it comes to the meat, it's like perfect. Total nerd alert, go in. It's like everything's packaged perfectly. Everything's a perfect size. Everything's, everything's itemized, cut date, animal species, you know? Well there's a deep respect for that animal data. Don't tell people who just buy their meat at a grocery store. It's, I don't think they could ever understand it. I think you can kind of intellectualize it and you can kind of imagine what it's like, but I don't think you could ever really understand it. Well, and I can relate to that because that wasn't always a hunter and I, I wasn't, I wasn't.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       I wasn't brought up a hunter. I didn't, I didn't come from a hunting family. Nobody in my family ever hunted all new to me. I started when I was 30 and I'm 43. So what was it that got you going? I moved from the, from the beach where I lived my whole life up to the mountains and um, I bought a piece of property and everything I planted got dug up by wild pigs, so there's wild boars all over the property and my wife started getting pissed and, and, and I didn't know what to do. I wanted to plant fruit trees and all this stuff and everything was getting knocked over and smashed by all the pigs. And so my buddy was like, dude, shoot him with a gun and shoot a couple and they, you know, they'll beat it. And so he gave me this shotgun or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       I shot with a shotgun and immediately gave it back to him and I was like, I'm not a gun guy. I just, I'm not into the loud noises. And I just was over it. So I gave it back. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know if I should need a fence. My property. I didn't want to do that, you know, because I didn't want to like mess up. They're like natural pattern either. They were there, they were there long before I was and um, and my next door neighbor was a bow hunter. He had an extra bowl so I would go over to his house and have a couple beers and shoot arrows and once I get group some arrows, he said I was ready to go hunting and he took me boar hunting and the first night all these pays were there and, and I, and I totally blew it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       I got to full draw and my Arrow fell off the rest and thing and all, they all, they all ran and made a bunch of noise. But that was it. The next day I went and bought it. I used mathews bow down at the bottom down at the boat shop and you know, I started a building trees, downs about my house and you know, trying to like throw down for the pigs to come. I didn't know the hell I was doing. I didn't know any bowhunters and um, so it's cool. So it's all like self taught. It was, yeah, it, uh, you know, I started with a good friend of mine at home at the same time I didn't really have any super close friends that were bow hunters and. But it's funny because soon after I started bowhunting, then I realized that I did know a bunch of bowhunters and I immediately had a really cool circle of friends that were all experienced bowhunters and they kind of took me in and taught me, you know, what to do, what equipment to use and you know, how to hunt.

Speaker 1:          00:24:20       And then, and then I had like mentors in hunting that really taught me how to hunt, like to kill animals. Well, Hawaii is an amazing place for bow hunting and a lot of people would never imagined this. It is amazing between axis deer and mountain goats and all kinds of other crazy shit that you guys and the pig popular pigs were brought over there. I'm like hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Right? Yeah. Is the captain cook thing wasn't. Yeah. So there was. So there wasn't really no animals in Hawaii. Every single thing there is introduced except for like bugs and some birds, you know, so um, the deer, the pigs, the goats, the sheep, everything was all introduced. So you go out in the mountains and there's lots and lots of different, you know, a lot of different animals out there and they're all introducing, they're all considered pests.

Speaker 1:          00:25:06       Wow. So it's a lot like New Zealand and that sort of a way that is new. New Zealand has an incredible amount of wild game, but it's all introduced and they did it back hundreds of years ago again when Europeans wanted it as a hunting destination. So they brought over stags and European animals and access deer and all these things and just let them loose with no predators. Yeah, that's right. So their populations just exploded. Yeah. I mean you came in Hawaii. What is it? What is it like over New Zealand? Because when you look at the Lord of the rings, you know, that's, that's all I know about new New Zealand. I know Kim Dotcom lives there and the Lord of the rings and people go over there to hunt. It's very much like that, uh, um, I hunted there this year and we hunted in some places that like I hadn't even done.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       All I do is I take pictures and stare at the mountains. It was, it was mind boggling how incredibly beautiful it was. We were hunting these, these, uh, these mountain goats called tar from the Himalayas there, these hairy goats with this big giant sable for thing and really small horns and they live and they liked these glaciers and he's like vertical cliffs, maybe like a thousand foot cliff at the top of like a 5,000 foot mountain of granite cliff, like a little step ledge in it that's like six inches wide. And that's where the tar would be standing. One Star. Just be standing there looking at all the other bad ass creatures. They really don't look real. Try and go kill one of those things with a ball on public land and sent me the picture and all the hail you forever. They are hard to kill with a bow.

Speaker 1:          00:26:32       I tell you that much. Did you get one? I didn't. I saw one. I was at remy who's a friend of yours, right? Yeah, yeah. It was a Ramey warrant and we spotted one and it's not like, you know, like where I come from. You go hunt access deer. You could see a thousand deer walk in the morning. Yes. Where mark my words dude soon. I'm online. I hold dear in a day. Yeah, that's insane. So I'm used to going out and seeing them like tons of pigs and goats and deer and stuff like that. I went to, I went to New Zealand and hunted these tar and I'm standing there with remy, the bottom of this valley and we're hunting or camping in the back country and we're, you know, we're glassing and don't see anything. So we drive like half a mile glass, you know, and we're in totally in the background.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       She went weren't driving straight up a river like deep in a river. We got like a, like a, a, one of those like land cruisers with a snorkel in the middle of the floor. It's not like these animals are under radical pressure and all of a sudden we see one, there's a tar and it's at the top of this mountain. 5,000 vertical feet, five miles straight up hill or one mile, right. Well, I don't know, whatever the hell it was was vertical. It's vertical, right? Yeah. I mean it's 5,000 vertical feet, but you're looking at it and it looks like it's right there, but it's vert right. It takes you four hours to walk there because it's vertical. And uh, you know, we saw it probably we saw it at like three in the afternoon and it got dark at like six. So he's like, dude, we have three hours. We need to close the gap. We need to kill that tar today before dark. So we're literally like, quote unquote running up the mountain

Speaker 3:          00:28:10       as fast as you possibly could. And he's in pretty good shape. Remy is, he's a beast. He's a beast. He's, I mean, that's what he does. He lives in the mountains all the time. So He's used to that. He's like, they did one of those vo two Max test on him and he's got like elite triathlon endurance. Yeah. He's like half human, half tar and uh, so. So we closed the gap to about 900 yards and then it got dark time and walk back down five hours in the dark. Well, it's fucking exhausting. Is proposing you don't realize like how hard it is to get up one of those mountains until you try it and you go, oh, like you think I'm in good shape. I work out, I go to the gym, I'm on the elliptical machine. This is going to be a no problem.

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       I'm not one of these fat guys. Oh yeah, no, no. It's fucking hard. It's really hard. Like any it'll help. Like being light helps to light and thin where you're not carrying around a lot of weight. Yeah. But guys like remy and Steven Rinella and the guys that do that all the time, they will embarrass you with how will out of shape. You are just walking up hills. You're just, you're just, you're just keeping them at a, you know, at your rate. It's like, it's like you're slowing them down all the time. Yeah. So it does pay to, you know, to train. Especially like in the mountains like that. Like if you're going to go on a big hunt it, it really helps to train a lot and now these animals, how the fuck, like I've seen goats like on the side of cliffs where they're walking along a vertical face and they're, they're standing on the little, like these little two inch outcroppings and they're walking along on those. Like how the fuck do they do that? Like how were they designed?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Like what, what kind of evolutionary advantage to like walking along the side of a cliff face like that has led them to be this bizarre beast. Like most people don't think about them like what their capabilities are and they can do like really strange shit. I get as far as if they're balanced and how they can make it up the side of a cliff. Like look at these fuckers. Yeah, look, look at that as exactly how the tar. Where did. We're looking at something that just doesn't even look real. We're looking at these goats that are walking along the face of this cliff and the cliff is almost 90 degrees. It's almost up and down and these things are somehow or another finding footholds, whether their whole body, like the side of their body is slammed up against the side of the mountain and they're making it up this cliff

Speaker 1:          00:30:29       and they're not forced to be on that cliff. That's the craziest thing. Like when I, when I was hunting those, those, those, those goats in New Zealand and star just below where they were, there was like these rolling hills, like really steep still, but it was rolling hills with grass. They choose to be on the rocks because they actually eat some weird stuff that grows on those vertical cliffs. So wild. What are they ripping balls the whole time. I'd be kidding me. The animal's not forced to be there. He's. He's choosing to be on that like six Inch Wide Ledge, a thousand feet on a vertical cliff.

Speaker 2:          00:31:01       Oh, look at that fucking. But we're looking at this picture folks. Jamie, what was the Google search? If someone's listening just like climbing goat. This is this picture that we're looking at now, there's probably like eight of them and they're on the side of this mountain and it just doesn't even look real and the tar does, they don't look real as it is. They look like some sort of a mythical creature from some ancient Greek novel.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to. It's really hard to appreciate how hard core that kind of hunting is unless you do it, you know? I think that like 90, I, I'm gonna I'm gonna Piss people off when I say this, but like 98 percent of the hunting that happens in America is like park a truck, walked to your trees, Dan getting the trees. Dan play play words with friends until the deer comes underneath the trees, down to full draw and, and you know, you got your tag filled and which is great. I'm sure it's a blast and I like dress downs and all that stuff, but that kind of hunting is just like a. it's weird how hunting is at, clumped in to like, oh, you're a hunter. And as all people sort of need to know, you know, there's like so many different kinds of hunting and so many different ways to do it, different weapons, different approaches, different. You know, it's like crazy. Like some people are shooting animals that had 100, 1500 yards of though with high powered rifles, they want to be as far as possible, that's the goal. And for us it's like we want to be as close as possible

Speaker 2:          00:32:27       that that long range stuff is very strange because there's a lot of ethical questions that come up with that because any movement whatsoever at 1500 yards, I mean you have to be like a real fucking expert marksman to pull something like that off. So there's this, there's a lot of Dick Wagon going on when you're killing something like 700, 800 a thousand yards. It's weird. It's like you don't really have to do that. Like you could get closer to that animal. I think that's the goal though. The goal is to fight. Anybody can get to 200 yards from any animal.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       Yeah. I don't care what animal it is. You can get, if you can get to 200 yards, you got major problems if you didn't get to 100 yards. I mean even from like an antelope. Yeah. You can belly crawl your way in

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       middle of nowhere to 100 yards from antelope. Yeah. Especially if you have one of those Ghillie suits. You know remy has this show called move super slow. Yeah. Have you seen remy show? It's called Apex Predator. Haven't seen that one though. Really good show and it's really interesting because remy remy is a really good athlete and he's also just a really smart guy and what he does is he tries to mimic all of the behavior of predatory animals like wolves and he'll do like him and a bunch of his friends were doing some sort of like a chase the same way that a wolf would chase down an elk and one of the things that he did was he put on a Ghillie suit and he crawled up to these antelope and just slowly creeped is way up to these antelope and as long as you're patient and you move slow, like he got within like seven feet of fuckin antelope, as long as you go slow enough.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       Yeah. That's a mistake I make all the time. You know, when I blow stock, it's almost always because I went too fast. No matter how slow you go, you should almost

Speaker 2:          00:34:11       always go slower and well. One of the things that I've found out recently, you know Randy Ulmer is famous bowhunter. It's like probably one of the most successful bowhunters ever. He shoots most of his animals with no shoes on his. He, yeah, he takes his boots off and he's got just thick wool socks and he just walks you just correct

Speaker 5:          00:34:30       the

Speaker 2:          00:34:31       nice and slow. And that's one of the reasons why he's so successful. He realized like, okay, you can't just be walking around with these fucking clunky boots and snap and twigs and shit like that. And so he feels everything underneath them and it's just like. Have you ever been around a bear like when a bear is walking through the woods? Uh, no, not really. They don't make any noise. It's kind of creepy. Like this big ass fucking 300 pound bear and it's not making a single sound as it's walking because they have soft pads and the predators. So they just fucking,

Speaker 5:          00:35:02       I've

Speaker 1:          00:35:02       been, you know, and that's kind of like the idea of the approach, just just creep inch by inch. Bears blow my mind too because you know, I've, you know, I'm from Hawaii so I don't even know anything, nothing about bears. So I think they're all like Yogi bear, you know, like they're coming in like your, your jam and hang out and camp with you know this, you know, they want a hug or something like that. And, and a man, I went hunting, I did a do it yourself over the counter tag elk hunt with my buddy from Hawaii and we were in Colorado and we're and we and we hiked into area and we're all excited and we don't, we didn't know shit about elk hunting. I did not call him. I didn't know what they did. I didn't know how they worked. I read some articles, I didn't know what the hell is going on.

Speaker 1:          00:35:46       So. And so we dropped off our stuff. We've got about an hour to hunt and then we're gonna come back and set up our, our, our, our little camp there, like a creek. So I do a big loop. I come back a little bit early. I'm not going to set up my tent and stuff and I get to one side of the creek and my friends across the creek setting up his tent and getting like, like our food out like Salami and like whatever else kind of food we had and I was just about to like yell out to him like, hey did you see anything? I was like maybe 60 yards away from him and I looked to my left and there's a bear, a big bear, big black bear standing on his hind legs look like one of those targets. He knows big old target to shoot one of those things and he was just staring at my friend.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       He had no idea was there. The bear didn't know I was there and that my friend had no idea that the bear was there. He's sitting there like butt crack hanging out, like getting all the food out and its barest just staring out from across the creek. It was radical and I just immediately knocked in Arrow and just sat there and then the bear saw me and then looked at my friend, looked at me, looked at my friend, and then it was this vertical mountain right behind him. We at the bottom of the creek and a bear thought about it and then just turned around and just hightail it straight up this mountain like he was on the flat ground was crazy and my friend saw that story that you were telling me before the podcast started. Tell that fucking story. That made me really even more scared of bears.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       Tell. Tell that story. Yeah, so it was a few years ago. I read this, I read this story on a bowhunting magazine and it was a story about this, this guy and his son, and they were hunting elk, not sure which state, but I'm. The son was in the front and he was set up and the dad was in the back probably 60 yards back and the dad was cow calling and there was a bowl there and he was starting to. He was starting to come into the call and so the kid was standing there waiting for his shot and the dad was sitting there, cal calling behind them and all of a sudden the elk runs off and they thought the wind had waffled on him or something, and right behind the elk, like 50 yards past the elc was a giant grizzly bear standing straight up staring at him and the kids started getting nervous.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       The bear started hightailing it straight up the kid and the kid turned and started running it. The Dad and as the kid and the and the dad went to full draw. He had a bow. It was. It was. It was archery season. He had no gun, so the dad grabbed his bow, got an Erewhon, had somehow had the clarity to get to full draw. As the kid passed his dad, the dad made a perfect shot on the bear. The bear right then catches up to the kid, dives on the kid and starts mauling him and ends up dying on the kid and there was a picture in the article is incredible. There's a picture in the magazine of the kid and he's covered, covered head to toe in blood. The bear died on him like a heart shot. Blood all over him for the kid like bear blood.

Speaker 3:          00:38:37       Oh my God. Oh my God. Just the Olympics. What is, um, how do you find this, Jamie? If somebody wants to call Dad, dad's zero saved son from grizzly attack to outdoor life. Fuck is a heavy article man. It's no joke. And the, and the, and the perspective from the dad, you know, it's like, can you imagine? I mean, I have, I have kids and I can't even imagine like what kind of mental state you'd be in if you saw a giant bear chasing after your kid. It does a bad motherfucker to keep it together. Yeah. That gives me the nerves, the jellies, whatever the fuck it is. My, my goosebumps are popping up. I saw a grizzly when I was in Alberta. Black bear hunting a couple of weeks ago. They look at you. So different than black bears are creepy enough, you know. And uh, Rinella was telling me a story about this guy who first trip ever hunting gets attacked in his tent by a 500 pound predatory black bear.

Speaker 3:          00:39:33       His friend shoots the bear, the bullet goes through the bear and hits his friend in the wrist. So this kid, first, first black bear hunt ever first camping trip out is going in the woods. Like this is going to regroup. We're gonna. Get to hang out with nature. Bear tries to eat him. And his friend shoots him. They killed the bear. They wanted to kill him. The bear. But black bears are scary, but they're nothing like grizzlies. This grizzly looked at us and they look at you like demons. They're there. They have a total different look in their eye. Like there's nothing going on back there. It's just dead killed. Machines look and feel bad when they can. They eat. You feel awesome. Gut feel super delicious right now. He'd be screaming, great. W, W, W, W, what? People are so strange, there are detachment from wildlife that when you're actually around them, even just around an elk, like when you're around an elk and elk or call and then making those crazy sounds just like, what the fuck is this real?

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       And they're fighting over the girls. Yeah. I just put that blows my mind like, like hunting deer or elk in the Rut and seeing them fight over the girls is the best. It's the best. And seeing like the one that, that loses gets his ass kicked and he kinda like just walks off like, oh God, I just got my ass kicked and ended up bowl. Or the big dog who, who wins? He's on, that's a whole Harem Harem full of girls and he's just like, I'm on the bad ass. You know, he just gets his fuck on man. You can breed them all. You know, I was in California to hone ranch last year and these two huge elk were smashing horns. They're both like threesixty class elk, which is like a for people listening. Just enormous antlers. Six points on each side. Thousand pound animals just running at each other head butting each other and stabbing each other and uh, while we were there they found one enormous bowl that had been killed by another bowl, been stabbed him in the, in the side and punctured his lungs and it was laying there jacked enormous bull as the coolest.

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       Seeing them like act like how they're supposed to be in nature, how they've been doing it for hundreds of thousands, millions of years. It's just nuts to just, just to be a part of that and see it. Yeah, it isn't. It's almost like we were talking about the goats being able to walk up the side of these cliffs, like these animals, they, they've evolved to develop horns that are swartz. They have like spears going out of their fucking head and they know it. Yeah. They're well aware of that and they were trying to kill the other one because it's there. So hopped up and they were just hanging with that guy a few weeks ago. Yeah. Were hanging out, feeding out in the, in the, in the grass, and they'll hang out with him again if he survived. Well, yeah, they hang out, but then make these bachelor groups and they get pissed.

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       Did you see that video of the lady in yellowstone that was like, no, no, no. Hello my friend. I'm your buddy. Oh Man. This elk just fucking headbutts this bitch and sends her flying. She went flying. Wow. How has that Grizzly man movie? Do you see that thing? I've seen it about 10 times. You don't see that you're tripping. It's so good. I'm trying to get Werner Herzog to uh, he, he, his people contacted me, the director of it to be on the podcast. I'm gonna try. Look at this. She's a kid. Knew Mr. almost like a comedy. You know what I mean? Like when I watched that movie, I felt like it was a comedy. The Guys Warner please. Oh, oh, oh, oh. He goes, you should get that on video. That shit's going to go find her.

Speaker 6:          00:43:04       Why 45 yard, ma'am.

Speaker 3:          00:43:13       That's been a long time. Thank you sir. I'm totally used to these elk. I'm out here every year. It's 25 yards. It's funny. He's got like a number in his head that you have to be 25 yards from them. Yeah. And then you're totally safe. Yeah, no problem. Super Safe. Please did they decide 50 yards to make a mad dash you. He's got a boner and this chick got scared off and he decides it's you that scare off and just go spear. You have no problem. Do you see the one where there's a guy was sitting on the side of the road as a photographer is a real recent one and they actually had one of euthanizing the elk because this elk fucked with this dude for like the videos like 10 minutes long. They Alex. so just like head button. This guy and the guy sitting there trying to cover his head as a spike and really young bull and uh, this, this photographers just hanging there and this bull starts head butting him and the guys just decided to just play passive.

Speaker 3:          00:44:07       This is it. Yeah. And this. But this goes on forever, man. And this bull just kind of not sure what to do because he's a really young bull. You're looking at that bowl. A spike is like, what a year old. It's funny how they get so smart so quick. You know, it's like, it's like at that age when it, you know, once I got like a yearling bowl, like a little spike, they're pretty stupid, you know, they'll come to any call and they're kind of spaced out. They don't really know what a human looks like. But man, once they turn into a six by six they are, they are not dumb. They get turned on. Yeah. But like this elk, I think I could kill that Alco my hands. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I have to see you try to get ahold of those. Antlers are spin around. Take his back.

Speaker 3:          00:44:49       Rear naked choke. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. I'm thinking I get his back and he's fucking done, man. It'd be fun. Drive for sure. Meanwhile he would back straps and that guy ride off with me. He would, he would load up the barbecue. He would. I would get her freezer. Oh yeah. Well, those are the most delicious ones. If you actually can, can kill one that that's really young like that. They're really tender. The same with deer. You know, everybody wants to shoot, but this is the thing about elk. They're so delicious that even the old ones, the old tough bull, they taste amazing meat. You can. Yeah. It's funny because I feel like super remorseful when I get an animal on the ground, no matter what it is, no matter if it's like a, uh, an elk or a deer or a pig or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       I had this weird feeling when I walk up, I'm like, I don't, I don't feel bad. I just feel like just as like heavy connection with that animal, you know, like I took his life. That was, that was my choice. You know, like I could have let it walk, but at the same time, like if it's like a, a younger dear, I'll smoke it, you know, because those are really good eating. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm out there trying to. It's funny, I, I don't, I don't have a list of animals in my head that I need to get. Or are you one of those guys where you're like, hey, you know, I need to kill them out and go, I need to get a stone sheep. I need to get a zebra. And you find that weird man. There's a, there's a show that I watch you ever seen that?

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       Uh, Tom Miranda's adventure bowhunter show television dude. I'm like a wookie in the mountain. You don't have a TV. I don't have TV. Wow. Got like Netflix on my computer. There's a lot of these guys that are into the super slams, you know, which means all the North American game animals and that just seems like a fetish to me. It gets real bizarre. Like I think you're losing sight of what this thing is supposed to be all about. Yeah, I'm totally fine with however anyone. You know, if someone's in a getting lions or whatever, that that's, that's their trip, you know, I'm not going to judge them, but I'm just, that's not me. I don't have a list of animals at all. If I just hunted mule deer and elk for the rest of my life and access, dear, that'd be good. I can hunt all year long and never get bored with those three animals.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       I feel weird about bears. Bears are the ones that weird me out the most, like killing a bear and eating it just first of all, it's really like one of the best animals. Like from a conservation standpoint, it's one of the best animals to kill because they don't have any predators and so if you don't kill them, they will. The only thing that kills bears, there's other bears, so they like where we hunt in Alberta, there's a giant population. I mean it's not uncommon to see 20, 30 beers in a day. It's really, really overflowing with bears and public service to get. Yeah, like I take a few bears. It decimates not just the moose population, the deer population, but the crazy thing is it's bad for the bear population for there to be this many bears because the boars eat cubs. Daryl, weird animal, like elk don't eat elk, but bears like they're predatory man.

Speaker 3:          00:47:41       They just go for an easy meal. There was an article recently that I posted today on twitter that they're finding the grizzlies are going towards people when they have cubs and super fucking dangerous, but the Mama bears are realizing that when they're around people that the big boars won't kill their bed, their cubs as much to here it is. Brown bears are using human shields to protect their cubs, but it's incredibly dangerous for people because when you're around a mama bear and she's got cubs, she'll fuck you. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't want to get near one. There's another one that I retweeted yesterday, some woman who was in a marathon. She was running a marathon in New Mexico and she ran past a mamma bear with her cubs. The Mama Bear, just societal Fokker up. Just beat the shit out of her. Cut Her up, ripped her apart, and she just played dead.

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       And uh, you know, she's really jacked and picture of all scarred up and you know, the bear left her alone. And then some other marathon runners came over and saw her huddled up in the fetal position off. Fucking covered with blood as a life changer right there. Oh yeah. Just the meat bear meat is really good. It's really good. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of misconceptions about bear meat. Well, apparently grizzlies are nasty, especially if you get a coastal grizzly that's all fall bears in spring bears, right? Like the taste of them. I heard, I heard the, I forget which one, but I heard one is a little bit better than false. Supposed to be the best because the fall bears are eating berries. I've only killed spring bears. Spring bears tastes really good. Yeah. And like I was saying like from an ecological standpoint and from a conservation standpoint, it's probably one of the most important animals to kill other than say white tail deer because there's so 2 million or so.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       What is it? What was the number like one point $5 million car accidents in the United States alone. 200 people die in the United States every year from hitting deer with their cars. That's the thing is people are so quick to point the finger like, I can't believe you'd kill a bear, you can't believe it, but they just can't wrap their head around the fact that they need to be those numbers get so out of control and the and the world's never going back to how it is before we lived where the bears live, you know? Right. That argument's a weird argument. Yeah. And their land. Yeah. Like I get it, that's fine, but it doesn't matter that point. It's invalid because all the people live there and when there's millions of bears running around, it's just, it's not good for them either, you know, but even knowing that I still feel weird when I kill a bear.

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       It just, there. There's so much like a dog almost. They're looking at enormous big dog. It's this, it's this. I think they're cool. They're cool animals. I like looking at them. I want to. I still want to hug them. You still want to. What was that? What was that show? When we were kids, a grizzly Adams, grizzly Adams, and he had that, like that was his best friend. I want her to be grizzly Adams. So bad. That wasn't the beard and the hat or anything. I just want to hang out and spoon that bear every day. So awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       I had the original hipster beard. I used to have. That guy would get so many chicks right now in Venice. I know, right? He went to fucking owning it. Yeah. He would be lifting weights. I didn't know it was [inaudible]. Sixty eight got a grizzly bear in his chest. Is that dude still alive? Oh Man. Grizzly Adams. It says death is death. So I would say no grizzly guy. He was so cool. It's funny. I had a. oh, it just died. My, uh, my wife and I, Dan Haggerty, my, my wife and I got a, my wife and I got a Burmese mountain dog years ago. Have you seen those? It's like a big Swiss dog. No. Awesome. Is A. It's related to a St Bernard. So it's very similar to a St Bernard, but they, they're not like a slobbering breed. They don't have slobber, so they're really awesome. They have this really cool markings, but mine was like 130 pounds, so it was like a grizzly bear and I swear I was like living my childhood dream of being adults because I would, I'd come home and roll around with my big bear, you know, it's like he was like a big grizzly bear who's awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:51:36       I wonder if that's. What did grizzly man in like maybe saw a grizzly grizzly adams when he was a kid and either that or he had just a bad batch or something ripping. Then I laughed the whole movie. Oh yeah. It's a hilarious moment at the end when he gets wasted by the barrel. I thought it was comical sheriff, if anybody had ever been asking for it. It was that dude 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah. I think it was suicide by Bayer. I really do, because he went back into the area where when you're not supposed to be there when the air, the animals are in hibernation, except for the really desperate ones and he knew that they were killing cubs. Like that was part of the, uh, the video. He stumbled upon these cubs that this bear had killed. They were starving to death. The rivers had no salmon there. It all dried up. There was no salmon run and it was getting real sketchy. He stuck around. They've accepted me as one of them was the best trip. Oh Man. Way to go. When the sheriff talked about it. Oh, I thought he was retarded.

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       Yeah, it is. I think it's a comedy and I want to talk to Werner Herzog because he's supposed to. We're, we're apparently we're in contact with people and we're trying to work something out because he's got something else that he's promoting, but there's no other documentaries that he does that are funny like that. Yeah. Like that one is fucking funny. I'm not sure it was meant to be funny, but it is. I feel like human being, you have to look and be like, you gotta be kidding me with this dude. There's some wild people out there though. For sure. Timothy Treadwell desperately wanted to be one with tobacco gold. The gold. I'm protecting these bears. No one's protecting these bears when he goes into those rants because he would, he would film himself going on like three or four different grants and he would only use like one of them, but some of them he would just start swearing and you park department and where's the, I want to get like the lost tapes.

Speaker 3:          00:53:30       They had a whole series and they really took his, they took his tapes and they made a whole series about it and it was fucking. I mean he had like hundreds of hours of footage and he got amazing, amazing, unprecedented closeup footage of bears because no ones that fucking snow at that crazy. You got to be nuts. Yeah. And those things. We're not like close to a town and used to humans. It was, that was like in the middle of nowhere. Middle of nowhere. His were straight up like wild grizzly bears doing wild. Crazy Bro. Shit. Yeah. And he was watching them go to war with each other. I mean he got footage from like 20, 30 yards away of these two enormous grizzly bears. Tell him to stop it. Huh? Stop fighting with that guy was 100 percent fighting the gay, like the gay was disturbing him so much. He decided to go camping with monsters.

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       He's like, I just added Kit can accept the fact that I'm gay and so he would fix that problem, didn't you? We grow with them at the time too. And apparently, um, apparently there's audio and I don't know if they destroyed it, but that was part of the, uh, the documentary. There's, it lasted seven minutes because fares don't fucking tell you. They just started eating you. They can hold you down. I'm not trying to kill you. They just want, I just want to eat you. That's a weird thing about omnivores as opposed to predators. Like, predators just kind of kill you. But I'm divorced for the most part. They just hold you down like chimps, chimps to hold things down and eat them. The whole like thing where like where we want to dispatch an animal as quick as possible to stop the suffering. They don't have that part in them.

Speaker 3:          00:55:04       They're just like, you want to scream? Go ahead. Yeah. If you're going to get jacked by something, a cat is the way to get Jack [inaudible] cats know how to kill you. Yeah, they're really good at it. Mountain lions to be scary man. Quick though. Yeah. Scary. But once they get your neck, yeah, you tell us. It's pretty much it. But guys fight them off. People fought off mountain lions because I think animals, they have this, this like tipping point where they go, okay, could I get fucking injured here? If I can get injured here, I'm going to back off and go kill something stupid. I'm going to go fuck someone's dog up or something. You know, because there's like a tipping point where the animal realize like, this guy is fighting for his life. Fuck, this is too much work. I'm out of here. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:45       You know, and that brings me back to the shark thing, like the, that that would be like just a horrific way to go. There's those things are enormous and when they want to kill you, they'll kill you. And it's a three, but this is a strange animal. It's like nature's cleanup crew. Nature's just decided, look, there's just too much shit in this ocean and so we're going to develop this insane thing that doesn't even, it doesn't even get to sleep. Get to see the footage of none of that. Did you see the footage of the surf contest that happened last year in Africa where the guy gets attacked by the shark? That's a good buddy of mine. And, and uh, they, I mean that was like a 18 to 20 foot long. Great White Shark. Pull it out up. Jamie.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       When I saw it, I was on a plane and that happen and I was landing in Honolulu and I turned my phone on and had like all these crazy messages from all my friends, you know, because it's just, you know, it's, it's a really small world in the surf world. And that was like, it was no accident that the giant great white shark was within a couple of feet of him. You know, look at that. Like everyone's like, oh, it wasn't trying to attack them. It wasn't, it wasn't. It didn't mean anything. That's great. White Shark is that close to a human being? It was having a real good look, you know, I think, oh fuck yeah. It may not have been wanting to attack them or whatever, but it didn't just get accidentally stuck in his leash. You know what I mean? When you do that right. There is a scare as a human being could possibly be without getting killed right there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       And he's looking at it. It's behind him and he's swimming. That's it right there. Right. That's it in front of them. It was body was right there. It in. Oh my God. Yeah. He's hard as nails and, and, and the other Guy Julian Wilson, that was mick fanning and the blue and look at him. He's just feeling when he got up on that raft and when that was going down it was, it was a full on ordeal of like, you know, it didn't happen like real quick and he just jumped on, was like, that was like a law. A lot of seconds right there. Happening is board got taken away from him and he had to swim and splash you splashing water, you know, panicking. And then the other guy, Julian Wilson in his, he was 100 feet away and I was paddling full speed towards him to try and help instead of like, that's like, that's like when you show your true colors, you know, that's when you know that Shit's going down is when you see a friend of yours getting what he thought was attacked by a great white.

Speaker 1:          00:57:58       You probably, it's probably just a switch that goes off in your head. You probably don't even. It's probably just pure lizard thinking, you know, it's like the survival feeling. Like when that thing hit his board and you're in full on panic mode, you realize like you have got to get the fuck away from this town. There's no other options. So I watched it and you see him read it. He doesn't like go. What was that? He reacts super. He was ready to like fight. If that thing was there, I'm 100 percent sure he started swinging right it right away. If it was right there, you know, I have a friend, actually I have a friend where I live. Um, he's actually, he lives on the same island is me, he's from, from where I live in a tiger. Shark, came up, grabs him, takes him under water by the side, grabs him with a whole mouth bite on his ribs and his head and takes them under water like six feet under water.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       And he had a straight up punch up with the thing underwater. Oh my God, he's beating the shit out of the shark. He's a big dude. But he was at the time he was like 16 years old. He Oulu and he's a local Hawaiian kid from where I live and it took them under water and he's straight up flat. The shark and I ended up letting him go yet I think he had like 200 stitches or 300 stitches or something. I mean his whole side was just cut open. It's amazing that he's amazing. He's okay. I can't even imagine what that would a little look in there. And the thing like looking at the eyeball, been right there

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       like staring at him, you know. And, and he said he was just hitting thing as hard as he possibly could. Luckily he's a big dude. It's crazy that they're attributing it. It makes sense though to overfishing that they're just don't have enough to eat anymore. It makes sense. Totally makes sense. And the thing is, no matter how many attacks there are, like there's been, there's been a shitload of attacks in Australia, a lot in certain pockets, certain areas. And there's one area in eastern Australia like on the east coast that is, has a ton of attacks and last five years and another place on the west coast. And there's all these groups that are just like, nope, you can't do anything to the sharks. You cannot do anything of the sharks, you know, well, who are these groups and what is there a mentalist groups that just like, no matter what, you can't, you can't hurt nature type of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:00:05       Is there a shortage of sharks? Well, I've mad it's, it's, it's hard. But the bottom line is if they were less sharks, it'd be less attacks, right? Yeah. So difficult. There's not a real, there's not a real solution where you can, where are you going to make everybody happy? You know what, you're never gonna make everybody happy when you have a environmentalists or animal rights advocates and there's a lot of like really fucking crazy and environmental and anti hunting an animal rights activists that they're not using logic or conservation, they just love animals. They want them protected at all costs. What's interesting is they don't have any problem with animals, fucking up animals. No. Like they don't like people eating animals, but they don't have any problem with animals. Just ripping animals apart. Yeah. It's weird. It is weird. It's weird because it's like they accept nature, they love nature, but they don't like the nature of a human being a predator.

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       Like they want to move away from that. Yeah. People are, are a trip these days. Man. I, I, uh, it's funny because the whole social media thing for me is, is, is relatively new. It's, you know, obviously we didn't grow up with that and it baffles me because you know, I can, I can spear fish and I've, I've posted like a photo of me. Nobody was like of my spirit and my fit. There's like a, like a bloody fish in my hand. Good job, great going. Awesome. Great Fish. No one says a word about anything that I killed a fish. You kill a deer. Hollow man. People just freak out. See what happens. Not Kill a bear. Bear. I can only imagine the more people who hated me for that than anything I've done. Besides fear factor. Yeah. Besides fear factor. They get so mad. I'm like, I'm eating it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:47       This is what I eat. I don't eat. I don't buy meat. People have such a problem with that. Now I get these done is dumbest comments like literally like there's plenty of meat in the store. Why would you have to go and do that? Oh, you're a terrible person. Like I'm not a terrible person because I go to the store and eat it. You're a terrible person because you go and get your food yourself. And, and kill it because you did the killing with your own hands. You're bad. I go and buy it with your money. You don't have to be pretty wild. That whole, it just blows my mind because, you know, I didn't grow up in a city. Like I get all these people

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       from like Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paolo or someplace in South America or a big city. And I hit the point I, I'm not pointing the finger at South Americans or anything like that. It's like, but it always, it's always people who are in cities because they have this major disconnection from their food. Right. And where I live, I live, I live in Hawaii. Everybody I know is a fisherman or a hunter and they, you know, people have gardens. It's like there's a way of life where they, where we live, there's tons of fish everywhere. If you throw your net, you're going to get dinner. That's what people do. They know the eat the food that they get around them. And not always, but that's just a, it's very, very typical to be a hunter or a fisherman. And you know like where I live, that's viewed as the same exact thing of fishermen and hunters the same. I don't, I don't see the difference. And so that's why it's shocking to me with the whole how people are totally fine. You clubbing a bunch of fish, but the second you kill a deer, they just lose it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:16       Yeah. Well what exactly what you said. It's just the disconnect of not, not really understanding where their food comes from. Not being in any way connected to the idea of the natural cycle of life. And then there's also a hierarchy of animals that you're allowed to kill. I'm not allowed to kill Turkeys. Nobody gives a fuck when you hold up a dead Turkey. No, don't give a shit. No. But if you hold up a dead bear and a dead for a period of those things. Yeah. Pigs, they don't have a problem with them. Shit about pigs. It's weird. Get rid of them. Especially for takes to. Yeah, like most people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Bacon everyday, right? Like, Yep. Get rid of those boards as that's a disgusting filthy animal. Kill it. I'm going to have my bacon too.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       Yeah. Why did you shoot that deer though? Yeah, but they have to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Well the bear bears are the big ones because I think in a lot of ways people associate bears with trophy hunting. Trophy hunting is something that. I mean I'm, I get it. I understand that there's a lot of money involved in it for the communities where they shoot these animals and that it benefits them and then also they have population issues with a lot of these animals. Like we were talking about it yesterday. The thing that happened in Zimbabwe with Cecil the lion. Yeah. How they have to shoot 200 lines now they have to kill them because they're just decimating the underland population. Nobody knows about that. All those people that were pissed about Cecil have no idea. They got to kill the lions. Yeah. No idea of how it, how it works over there, and the only reason those lands are alive is because of hunters and they're losing a million dollars in revenue because they cost them $50,000 to shoot a lion. So all that money would go to conservation, hiring all the conservation agents and stop. I'm

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       really. Yeah, I mean it's a, it's a shitty system. It's because they're dangerous. They can't do it. Like in America, it's great. It's like, you know, when I bought my tag for Colorado, I buy it for 600 bucks, like 5:50 goes straight to conservation and that's awesome. And that's why there's so many animals, you know, and that's it. That's a really healthy system of how to, how to like increase populations, how to, how take care of habitat

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       at a higher more park rangers, how to, how to buy more land and, and, and, you know, make bigger reservations and bigger conservation areas. And I don't think people know that, but they don't. Most people have no idea that most of the money that goes towards wildlife habitat, like maintaining habitat all comes from hunters like 90 percent. And then on top of that there's a tax on sporting goods that goes to that. And you know, people always say, well, hunting isn't conservation, but you know what? Here's the thing. Hunters and hunting products, whether it's a bowhunting stuff or rifle stuff, they did not fight that tax, but you knew who did fight that tax. All those other companies that make hiking stuff and Rei and those companies, they didn't want attack, so they've tried to impose another tax and these people have fought it off and the reason they fought it off is because they don't have to pay it.

Speaker 2:          01:06:06       They don't have to pay it. It's going to fuck with their overhead's going to fuck with the amount of money that they have to charge for things, and so this, this idea that these hunters aren't real conservationist, they're using it as an excuse. The bottom line is that's where all the money's coming from. All of it for habitat protection, wetland habitat protection law, all that comes from hunters and it's all a lot of money. It's like if they stopped hunting, if they made hunting illegal and they cut off that supply revenue, there's a lot of animals that we'd be fucked. There would be. People don't like it because it's one of those really weird kind of gray area things or it just doesn't make you feel comfortable thinking that the money that has come, first of all, the only reason why there's elk and all the habitats that they're at right now is because hunters introduced them to those areas.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       They were decimated by the turn of the 19th century or the 20th century, so in the early 19 hundreds there was very few elk left in this country, so the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation spent considerable amounts of money, resource man hours moving animals into these areas like Kentucky, like Kentucky has like a huge ell population now. There was nothing there just 30, 40 years ago. Nothing, zero. So they've. They've figured out a way to not just maintain populations so hunters can kill them, but they've also reintroduced him to areas where they didn't exist before. Increase populations by a hundred times in a lot of students. I mean the elk numbers have never been as high as they have been in the last 20 years. Yeah, no, no. There. It's amazing what they've done and it's all because of hunters and that's that's. I understand it for people that are animal rights lovers, but I just wish they had a more balanced perspective and they understood what all the pieces that are in place are. It's, it's an uncomfortable thing for a lot of people to think that the people who want to hunt and kill and eat these animals are the ones that love them the most. Yeah. This crazy thinking. Right? Well all the people that are super butthurt about the hunting thing aren't doing anything about it. Yeah, of course. Yeah. They're just being angry and lashing out with their phone, but they're not doing anything to say the animals, those, those, those people are

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       on the front lines in Africa trying to save the lions or the elephants or trying to. Trying to go against poachers and do something about it. All those people are just are just chit chatting, you know, well, there's not enough money. I mean, if they really wanted to do the kind of work that the hunters who are doing, they'd have to have some stream revenue and the stream of revenue that is coming from hunting is all coming from tags. It's all coming from the sale of hunting gear and products and there's just no way they can match that. There's no way. There's millions of hunters, millions of hunters that are contributing literally a billion dollars. It's probably more than a billion dollars a year that goes to conservation. Yeah. Especially. So it's, it's a weird. It's one of those weird things. It just doesn't. It seems like it should be cut and dry.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       Well, and I think people have a misconception of about hunting in general, like in most states, like, like say Colorado, that the areas that I've hunted there, like on a do it yourself over the counter tag costs me like 550 bucks, 600 bucks and I go there with my buddy. It's in an area that has, you know, a seven percent success rate for archery or maybe less six or seven percent. So out of 100 hunters, maybe six or seven people get an elk, so all these people are really just paying for the experience of elk hunting. They're not even. It's not like they're going in there buying an animal or nothing like that. It's like I'm going out, I'm going to Colorado. This is my trip for the year. I choose to go out and just hunt elk for two weeks or three weeks or one week or however long you have time and.

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       And that's what the hunting experience is all about for me. I mean I, I love them the meat. That's awesome. I love the successful hunt. That's great. For sure. I love eating it, but the. But the bottom line is if I go elk hunting and don't get an elk, it's not an unsuccessful hunt. I'm so stoked. This is like the best experience ever. Yeah. It's a very enjoyable, deeply rewarding experience just to be out there trying and attempting it and when you are successful it makes it that much more rewarding because you know how difficult it is, especially when you're doing it with a bow and arrow. Yeah, I mean it is. You have to get within, I mean if you're really fucking good, you could shoot something within 90 yards, but for the most part you're trying to get somewhere within 30, 40 yards.

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       Yeah, that's right. It's about Jim. What is this? Oh, well, I got sportsmen contribute nearly $8,000,000 every day. Adding two more than two point $9 billion dollars every year for conservation hunters and target shooters have paid seven point $1,000,000,000 in excise taxes since the inception of the Pittman Robertson act in 1937 sets. Incredible. Everybody in America knows about Cecil the lion. Everybody knows about Cecil. Nobody knows that. Nobody. Only hunters know that, you know? Yeah, I'm confused here. How's that work? It says I get the $8,000,000 everyday contributing more than two point $9 million dollars every year for conservation. But this is what I don't understand. It says hundreds and target shooters have paid six, seven point 1 billion in excise taxes specifically that just specifically excise taxes. Yeah. Okay. It's a shitload of money. Yeah. So it's tags, um, and

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       then equipment and taxes. So I guess the taxes is whereas this is the billion, the seven point 1 billion, the rest of it is tags, which is two point $9, billion dollars a year. It's amazing. It's amazing. But again, it's the people that live in the cities that are disconnected and I was one of them. I mean if you talk to me, if you got a hold of me, you know, 20 years ago when I never even considered hunting and he asked me about like it'd be a little assholes shooting an animal. Animals are awesome. Bunch of pussies with their big guns. Go buy dog food and cat food because I love animals and buying ground up fucking chickens. Yeah, I mean that's the funniest one is like vegans with cats want more than one point four, $2, billion dollars through state hunting and fishing license. Wow, that's incredible.

Speaker 2:          01:11:57       One point $4,000,000,000 in conservation comes from hunting and fishing license sales. Six hundred, 8 million from other revenue. Seven hundred $49 million to excise taxes paid solely by sportsmen. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's where the money comes and if that money's not going to be replaced by people who love animals and that's also, there's a lot of people that think of hunters like the characters in a movie like an Elmer Fudd, some asshole who hates animals, but when you listened to like really good hunting podcasts, like there's this guy, Jay Scott, he's got a really good hunting podcast and cody rich as a rich outdoors and Steven Rinella has immediate or podcasts, which is Mike, my favorite. You're, you're listening to really intelligent, really smart, well educated people that understand a lot about conservation, the environment, the animals they're pursuing and when they're talking about tactics and strategies and details and all the different, different areas of your hunting, all the different places where you're putting in for tags, you realize like this is a complex system that they're trying to navigate in order to be successful. It's fucking very, very difficult and it's primal as fuck. The whole thing is like, it's a wild experience and like literally wild and many different levels. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:13:17       And just, uh, yeah. I just, I don't know. I can't get enough of it. I swear. Like I, I, I feel like I, I like, I measure my success not so much now because my kids are having a family guy and, and that's basically all I care about is my kids these days. But I swear like I measure my success by how many days a year I spent in camouflage. That's how I know I had a super good year is if I went hunting a lot. I swear it's like, and, and like if I, if I'm, if I don't hunt for awhile, like my wife will call my friend and be like, dude, you gotta take Shane Hunting. He's being a dick. He's being a total asshole and you need to take them honey. So it's like you need to get your fix. I know I just get grouchy and grumpy and I don't even really feel it coming on. And my wife's like, you need to go hunting, but what is it you think that's causing that? It's like the, I don't know, is

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       it, is it something's causing hunting? Not Hunting. Hunting is alleviating that and some sort of a way. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:14:18       and surfing I, I do, I've, you know, I need to surf a lot and I need to hunt a lot. It's just who I am now. It's just like I'm, I'm 100. It's like I'm a surfer. It's, it's not what I do. That's the, I feel like that's who I am.

Speaker 2:          01:14:31       So it's just being a part of the natural world. Like the surfing thing is you're, even though you're on a board that's made out of composite materials and you know, you've got wax on and all this jazz and it's all created by a factor, but there's something about your, you're introducing your life or your, your being into the natural world of the ocean and you feel something like, they say that the ocean has some sort of an electro magnetic like feel to it like there's something about the ocean because it's essentially alive. You know, it has living things in it, but there's oxygen in the water and that's, that's how these plants grow. And when there's dead spots, that's why these fish die like this. It's almost like an, it's not just like an ecosystem, it's almost like a giant living thing and you're swimming around in that thing sort of absorbing its life for us

Speaker 4:          01:15:21       and I feel like it just keeps you young. I think it's like, I swear like surfing a lot, being in the sun, being in the ocean a lot and not like sitting there frying yourself or anything like that, but just like spending a life in the ocean and in the sun. Is this good for you? Yeah, I know people who are in their fifties and sixties and nurses healthy, they look young. They don't, they don't have like tons of physical problems and um, I don't know. It's just, I think it's good for you. I think spending time in the outdoors, whether you're in the mountains with your bow or whether you're in the ocean doing, doing whatever you're doing, it's just good.

Speaker 2:          01:15:53       Well, it's certainly good to be active now and it's also absorbing vitamin D three or creating Vitamin d three through the song. So that's a rare thing.

Speaker 4:          01:16:01       Yeah. Then coming home with organic grass fed wild meat is even better. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       yeah, no, all those things are, I mean you, you're living a very natural life in a lot of ways and that what you know, and again it's, there's also the satisfaction element, just like the people who grow a garden can Kinda, and I have a garden I get it, is there's a, there's a connection, like if I grow some tomatoes and some Kale and I put together a salad when I'm eating that salad, I'm like, I know we're not, not only know where this came from, I was there, I put the seeds in, I watered it, I fertilized. Yeah. It's um, there's something deeply satisfying about making your own food that you grow or that you go and get as opposed to going to a supermarket. It

Speaker 4:          01:16:43       only takes a lot more effort to. Yeah. So you just have like a, you know, like that, that elk steak that you eat. Like if you, if you, if you did a side like a side by side comparison with someone who didn't hunt, you know, they may not feel the same way, but because you packed it out, you put all the time and on the target you did all the hunting, you, you, you like look forward to it for six months that hunt and it just, that's the best tasting steak you're ever going to have because you have the pride of knowing that you did it all yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       Yeah. It's certainly a very, very different feeling now living in Hawaii and being a white guy. What is that like? Because people say weird things about it. I've never found Hawaiians to be racist or rude or weird, but I've heard crazy shit and I've always wondered like if that crazy shit is from like rude Americans that come over there and are disrespectful or act like they own the place or.

Speaker 4:          01:17:37       Well, there's a little bit of both. Yeah. There's a little bit of both. There's, there's uh, you know, I mean I grew up. I mean I was born and raised in Hawaii so I saw a lot of this, you know, like in high school and elementary school, like if you were a white, like everybody wanted to be a Hawaiian when they are young. Right? Like everybody at my school, like if you're white you kind of wish you weren't really. That's kind of the deal. Yeah. When you're really young, especially back in the day, like is it like seventies and eighties? Right. So like when I was a kid there was this thing called kill holiday, not making it up. I don't like. So you know what holly is like a white dude. So there was a thing, it was called kill holiday and it was always at the end of the year and it was like, I don't even know if they actually practiced it when I was a kid, but it was still, it was a thing and it was a thing where like Hawaiians would be like this is it, like we're almost out of school.

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       It's beat up some holly's or whatever deal was. And that's, I mean, it didn't really happen when I was when I was a kid, but there was a thing called kill holiday and people would talk about it and, but times have definitely changed. And uh, and, and uh, and the other thing is like, there's a huge difference between a white dude who was born in Hawaii and a white guy who moved to Hawaii. So if you're from Hawaii, like born and raised in Hawaii is totally different than, than if you're a dude from Orange County that moved to cal moved to Hawaii when you're 18. And then like next thing you know, you're trying to talk like the Hawaiians and stuff like that. That's when people freak that, that's people lose it when the, when a dude rolls up and like with the Hawaiian stickers on their truck and jumps out and is trying to act like a local dude, that's when guys get angry. That's not cool. So it's like a cultural appropriation thing. Yeah, they just, it's just like, um, I don't know how to explain it, but it's, it, it gets a little complicated. But if you show people respect, you know it, if, if you're chill, if you paddle out in the water at a, at a localized break and you're mellow, you don't have a bunch of Ding dongs with you. If you paddle out by yourself and you show respect and you're mellow than everyone gives you. Respect that. That's what I've always found.

Speaker 2:          01:19:34       So the issue is disrespectful people and a lot of ways, right?

Speaker 4:          01:19:38       Yeah. It's just a, it's just different. It's like its own country. It's like I've never been to Texas, but I hear it's like its own, its own kind of place is definitely it's own country. If you get off the plane at my house and you get like a convertible Mustang rent a car and someone's going 45 and 55 and a lifted truck, you don't pass them. You know what I mean? If you pass them, they'll chase you down and will really. Oh yeah, that's just disrespectful. It's like you're in Hawaii and I'll slow down, you know, don't, don't, don't go 65 and a 55 and a convertible Mustang. It's like they're just, it's just a strange place. It's like, it's a, I don't know, it's just, it's, it's, its own kind of place, man. Well, it's, it's occupied. I mean, it's sort of an occupied country completely.

Speaker 4:          01:20:22       Yeah. It's like they don't, they're a part of the United States, you know, in quotes, in air quotes, but not really. That's a country. And then people sailed. They're on sailing canoes from French Polynesia with stars for navigation. They got there on their own. Anything with them? It's, I dunno, uh, it'd be 3000 miles or something like that. What in the fuck they did that in a canoe. Yes. I don't even like driving to vegas and like, hey guys, like we're out of here. We're actually, we're not good. Just going on a cruise. We're moving. We're going to become. Hawaiians were to bring our babies and you have kids. Imagine bringing your kid on a fucking whole move to Hawaii. They live there. They had their awesome system of the people in the mountains. They trade with the people at the beach for food and sustenance and that's how they live.

Speaker 4:          01:21:11       You know, there's a mountain people, there's the ocean people and nobody owned any land. There was no concept of owning land. People will just share it and got along and they had their system that worked, you know, it was a gnarly time too. There was, there was a lot of gnarly stuff that was going on. It was like a radical time to live. If you're, if you did something bad, you're, you're executed and all kinds of crazy shit and like back in the day. But um, you know, when the white dude showed up when Captain Cook showed up and the missionary showed up and their boats and they were trading a musket for like 100,000 Acre ranch, you know, it was like she got crazy in Hawaiian and you and you can feel that nowadays. I mean there's a lot of Hawaiians are getting pushed out, know all these people live in different places on the mainland and make a bunch of money.

Speaker 4:          01:21:54       And then they retire in Hawaii because who wouldn't? Right? Everybody wants to live in Hawaii, but they bring their money to Hawaii. It drives the value up. And then the Hawaiians can't live there anymore and they get pushed out to these areas that are less desirable, that are, you know, and they can't make money in Hawaii. So there's a lot of resentment, you know, there's, there's, there's a lot of, there's a crazy dynamic and Hawaiian and you feel that and I don't know that that'll never get taken away. How does that work? Because the last time I was there, I was looking at these properties that were on the beach. I was like, look at the size of this fucking place is enormous house that someone built on this beach. And someone was telling me, yeah, that's some ceos, Jamey, it's his house, he's got a fucking helicopter pad and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:22:34       And I was like, okay, how does that work? So this guy like flies in, stays there sometimes and how the people around feel about that a week, a year. And they spent five years building their house with like Italian. Granted that's flown in from Italy and, and you know, you know, and, and it's like. And I was like, guess who's swinging the hammers, right? Hawaiians, yeah. Yeah. And they have to drive there from like their little zone or wherever, you know, wherever, wherever they're living, they definitely don't live in like a private community by the beach golf course. Well, and so how do people feel about those

Speaker 3:          01:23:05       people that do that? They, do they get upset at them? Are they angry at them? Really? I think they understand. I just think they, they, uh, it's just a difficult situation. You know, it's like, it's like a, it's like a lot of places in America really think about it. It's not, it's not that unusual situation in Hawaii. It just seems odd because it's, there's so many of these multimillion dollar vacation estates that are bought by the beach and you're like, that's like some crazy fuck you ceo type money that you have to have to have one of these things. Like how weird is it? These people that come to this place and they occupy the spot, but there's a bunch of people that have been here and their ancestors has been here for a thousand plus years and this is kind of their area, but you can buy a spot.

Speaker 3:          01:23:50       There were five days a week their whole life and they can't buy a house, you know, and then the whole, you know, the whole, the whole runway where I live is filled with private jets. Just sitting there waiting. Really? Oh yeah. People spend 50 million on their house. Like there's a, there's every single one of those guys in the fortune $500. A CEO is all the guys from every big giant tech company. They all have houses where I live one week a year and their jet. That's so strange. That's a good while to break in when they're not there now they got top notch security. Think they wouldn't use it. Like tech guys. Roseanne Barr is a friend of mine. She lives there. Yeah. It's a cool place to live. I mean it's, it's. People understand why those people want to live there. The weather's great. It's a beautiful place.

Speaker 3:          01:24:31       No one's, no one's blaming them for living there. That's not the problem. But the problem is them being disrespectful to the people that do live there. And if you're going to be there, relax toy, right in a big rush. Don't overtake me. Don't drive like you live in an asshole. This is not la. Yeah, it's not. You know, so just when you get to Hawaii, just relax a little bit. Oh, I got that text shoe this morning. The texts that you sent me. Fuck la traffic. That's all it said. It. She realized like this place is the exact opposite of the big island. I mean this place is some strange sort of magnet for Weirdos and everybody's just getting sucked into this giant population center. And you try to get anywhere even in the middle of the day. I mean you were, you were here at noon, so you're driving around at 11:00 AM.

Speaker 3:          01:25:21       Eleven am. Everybody's at work. No big deal. Yeah. Jammed bumper to bumper. You should go out. Go out at four just so you want to kill yourself. Just go get on the four or five at four in the afternoon. You'd be like, what in the fuck is this? What is this? If you get on the four, oh, five between like 11 at night and four in the morning. You beat rush hour traffic. Yeah. If you don't. Maybe if you. If you're. If you. If it's light outside, it's rush hour. Yeah, straight up. Because I drove just now from San Diego to La. I stopped in Orange County and get an MRI, but I. It was rush hour traffic the whole way up. There was a stop and go and it was like it was. There was no accident. There was no road construction. There's nothing. That's. Well sometimes

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       you'll be in a bumper to bumper stop. It's a mile long at two in the morning. Yeah. Fuck man. What the fuck is this as? I don't know. That shit drives me crazy that a parking in the street sweeping and then they have these like, like the, like the technology, like in places like Manhattan beach and Hermosa Beach, they have like these, like the, the parking meter dudes. They have a thing now where if the parking meter, if your money runs out, they get like a big. Like they know where you are and that your parking meter ran out and they can drive over there and they just go right to it. It's not hyper efficient technology to give you tickets. Imagine like the revenue, right? It's like, yeah, but that's kind of what drives me nuts. That's Kinda what I was getting at when I was asking about Hawaii.

Speaker 4:          01:26:50       It was like, there's different kinds of weirdness. There's a different kind of weird just to live in there. And then there's a weirdness to living here, which is the overpopulation weirdness and the show Biz weirdness. Yeah. Like what do you prefer? Oh Man. You know, I don't know how I was born and raised in Hawaii as you know, like the pace I liked the. I liked that no one gives a shit which school my kids go to or what I drive. No one judges me if I drive a shitty car or they. You better the opposite. Yeah. And, and, uh, I just, I don't know, I dig that it's, it's people, people, people judge me on who I am as a person and what I do and how I, I know, I feel like it's a little bit more, it's just a little bit more real I guess and just, you know, more down to earth where I live, but I also don't live in like the, you know, I live in kind of a small town, so it's like coffee farms and ranches and it's pretty chill where I live.

Speaker 4:          01:27:46       Yeah. Yeah, that's the weirdest thing about the big island. Um, I'm a big fan of the big island. I love visiting there, but one of the craziest things about it is there's so many different ecosystems in one island or you drive through this one area, it's like completely dry. It looks like a desert and then you go into another area is constantly raining. It's like a tropical rain forest, like Hilo, like up in that area. Yeah, it's wild. I don't know, I, I should look it up. But uh, I have uh, the, the big island of Hawaii, there's like all these, like a climate zones and they always say that I forgot the exact numbers, but it's like out of the, out of like these certain sort of climate zones throughout the world, like the Big island has like 11 of the 13 or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:28:28       So like if you get in your car and drive for two hours, you'll go through like a, like if you just like happen to like go to sleep and wake up like 15 minutes later everything looks different and go to sleep, wake up 15 minutes later, everything looks different and it changes so much. You know, it's wild, it's like a lot of feel desert and like, like a dry land forest and there's like a rain forest and jungle and it was just bizarre. Well that's the other thing about the big island is that there's sometimes snow there. Oh yeah, go snowboarding sometimes. What the fuck? Where's the happened? Like build a kicker and like launch off it. And that's what we do. And when it was snowing and I was in high school, we drive up there,

Speaker 2:          01:29:09       I try to go every year to the observatory. Keck observatory. Yeah. When it's, when there's no moon, so you could see the stars just to freak myself out because I went once many years ago and it just changed my world and I am the one experience changed the way it was, like literally being on a spaceship and changed the way I looked at the world because um, for people don't know, there's all these light diffusers. There's diffused light lamps all around the big island so that it doesn't give any light pollution to the keck observatory. Which one of the biggest telescopes in the continental United States or in the continental United States, right? It's not technically in the U, s in the world. I think even the clarity and, and uh, and no light pollution there. It's beautiful. You go up there and you see every star and it just seems. It seems like you're on a spaceship. It's like you're on a spaceship and you're looking through a portal. Yeah, that's what it looks like. That's literally what it looks like. Yeah. And it, it, it almost hurts your brain. It's like, is this up there all the time?

Speaker 4:          01:30:08       Not to open a can of worms, but did you follow that whole a telescope thing last year on the Big Island? Oh, about the construction. Thirty meter telescope

Speaker 2:          01:30:16       that they were trying to do and they said it was sacred lands. We couldn't build it. Yeah. Well explain that. You are up on it.

Speaker 4:          01:30:22       That's it. I mean, uh, the, the, the land, the land where the telescopes are built are considered sacred land by a lot of. I mean basically like every single Hawaiian group that there is, but there's a designated, there's a designated area within that sacred land that is designated for like astronomy and you know, all that stuff. So, but they have like all these giant giant telescopes that are owned by different countries, like China has theirs and the US has theirs and Soviet Union, whatever, whatever. They like. All these big countries span all these billions of dollars to make their telescopes and there's some of them that are completely obsolete and they're not even being used anymore, so instead of taking those four or five down that they're not even using anymore and building a new big one, they just wanted to build a whole another big one. So there was people were up in arms about it and it was going to be the largest building on the big island as well, so people were just up in arms about it and, and there was all kinds of um, you know, people got super activated and really started protesting the whole thing and blocking the road and people were getting arrested and all my friends were involved and everybody was, was against it and protesting.

Speaker 4:          01:31:28       It was pretty wild

Speaker 2:          01:31:29       because they just didn't want the construction to continue and make bigger things. So they felt it seems inefficient. Right. It seems like they should be able to take down the old ones and put up a more modern one.

Speaker 4:          01:31:38       Yeah. There was, there was not really any Hawaiian groups that were against the technology and against the space exploration. It wasn't anything about that. It was the fact that it was, they felt like they were being disrespect because it was sacred land that was not meant to, you know, build giant observatories there. And, and the fact that there was all these ones that weren't being used is not in the front. Crazy is actually my truck is in the back, happens around here all the time. Yeah. It was a wild time. And I, and it was a weird because uh, the, you know, the, the, the construction company that was building it, they had the permit already had the financing already and they had the Hawaiian government backing, backing them. I thought it was over. I thought for sure there was no way to stop the thing and it was amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:32:25       Like people really got activated like through, through social media and everybody just got up in arms about it. Everyone around the world knew about it and, and they ended up stopping it. That's incredible. Is incredible. I wonder if that's a good thing or a bad thing because I'm a big fan of space exploration and I'm a big fan of what they find out what these telescopes. Yup. But it seems like if they have telescopes through not using anymore, maybe it's just a financial issue or cost a lot of money to break them down and put a new one in the place and it's not as financially efficient as starting a new one. Well, it's always one of those things where it's like it's, you know, in, in white everything sacred. Unless you have enough money. It's like America in that way. It's like if you, if you want that beach front house, nope.

Speaker 4:          01:33:10       You can't have it. Oh, you got enough money. No worries. You know, if you're willing to pay like crazy for it. Yeah. So if you want to build a observatory on the big island, you can't do it unless you have enough money to put $100 million into the, into the education system in Hawaii and grease all the right politicians and get it all through. And Yeah, a lot has to happen for one of those things to be built and then the contracts, everyone's fighting over like the building contracts because it's going to cost two point $8 billion to build a thing. So there's a lot going on, a lot of, um, a lot of crazy politics happening behind the scenes to get that space exploration happening. So that's unfortunate. Yeah. And I don't think there's more than 100,000 people on the whole island, right? Yeah, there's, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:53       There's bar now. How many people live? Long Island? I think it's roughly between 150 and 200,000 now. And when did that change? That's just slowly going out. A lot of people are moving there, especially to the Kona side where I live, there's a lot more people moving there permanently, man, it looks like lame on dope place to live. It's a good place to live. I mean it's, it's don't move there. If you're listening to this, you got nothing people down holly's are you one of those so you don't count as a holly? No, I'm just kidding. Are you one of those? Do you ever get called one of those? Uh, rarely, but I am a holiday. I have white skin, you know, but I don't know, I mean I, I feel like that's, I'm not from anywhere else. Right. I'm not from, I'm from New York City or from Afghanistan.

Speaker 4:          01:34:42       But do you, do you know how to talk pigeon? I know how to talk to Virginia, like if you were going to say do it or Rogan show, he won't do it. It's dangerous. It's dangerous speaking ebonics when I, yeah, when I, I don't speak pigeon, but when I'm having beers with, with uh, with, with uh, you know, when I'm at home and I'm a couple of beers deep and yeah, it starts slipping out every now and then. But yeah. Oh, so it's something that you did when you were younger? A little bit, yeah. Just to get along. And it's just, I dunno know, it's just, it's very typical to when people, most local peoples speak pidgin wireless. Yeah. Bj Penn was explaining it to me once. Yeah. And he was like saying like how you would say things and that some people turn it on and off, but I just speak normal English.

Speaker 4:          01:35:26       Well, it's a cool sound. It sounds cool. It's interesting. It's very friendly. Sort of a fun. It is way to relaxed way. My parents regal, my parents were, were uh, would've killed me if I spoke in the house. Yeah, there was not cool. Plus it's like, yeah, I dunno. I am a white guy so it's not. I am not like a, you know, I didn't grow up in a Hawaiian family where everyone spoke. Pigeon. So did your parents moved there? Yeah. My Dad was from La. My Dad is from my dad or some this town. He went to Hollywood high school, Surf Malibu and he, he raced cars and he was a stunt man. He was a, he was a stunt man for Elvis. Elvis couldn't swim. What? Elvis couldn't swim. I couldn't swim. Honeymaid pulmonary on pills. I think that he would float cookies.

Speaker 4:          01:36:12       All bloated. No kidding, right. That was fat elvis. He was, he was in his prime back then. But uh, yeah. So my dad did a bunch of movies with him. I'm like blue, Hawaii and all that. He had like a series of movies that were all filmed in Hawaii and elvis couldn't swim, so my dad was, the, was a stunt double for all those movies and they just decided to stay and he, he just got sick of La and uh, he hated the parking guys. No, I think he just, he went to Hawaii and fell in love with it. He, he ended up like moving on, moving to a Wahoo and served and hung out and met a bunch of local people that he liked and he liked the lifestyle and how people were there and ended up moving into. My mom went to college and she was from Ohio and right when she graduated high school she moved to Hawaii and went to uhh.

Speaker 4:          01:37:00       Well I know a dozen. Woody Harrelson live in Hawaii. Yeah. That's where the best weed is really best. We'd listen if there's better way than what I have. Keep it the fuck away from me. Whoever's got better, we'd stay away. You can't get any better. There's a lot of ways that our hands are young people always want to say that. Like someone said, no, I'm just kidding. But we're talking about Colorado weed isn't basically legal. Basically illegal. It's pretty. It's pretty casual where I live, I'm sure, but it's not. I hear if somebody wanted to fuck with you, they could technically. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. See, that's the thing about like Colorado Colorado's wide open. Yeah. It's just, there's nothing you just can't, you know, it's just, it's just legal. Yeah. Nobody can go to jail unless the feds come in and then you get like, some you don't want to fuck with Colorado people.

Speaker 4:          01:37:44       There's a lot of guns in Colorado. That'd be a weird place for the feds to kind of evade. That. Gives a lot of people like that. Like woody Haroldson guys like, I mean, you know, I mean, I don't know what He. But uh, I've, I've, I have friends who've known him on Maui. They say he's just chill, just, he just likes to likes to Hawaii lifestyle, you know, relax. It was a very nice guy by all accounts. I ran into this couple the other day at the comedy store and they, uh, they moved from La to Hawaii. They live in Maui now and I'm, the girl hates it. The dude loves it. It was interesting talking to them because the dude works at a resort there. He's like, it is the fucking best place in the world live. Everybody's relaxed. It's super cool. The weather's amazing.

Speaker 4:          01:38:22       It's beautiful. And the girl was like, I gotta get the fuck out of here. Yeah. So my wife is a moved from La to Kona. She went to Ucla and then she worked for Warner Brothers television. Whoa. Yeah. So she was on the grind. Is that what you met her? I met her. I met her in San Diego years ago, like before, like right when she graduated high school and started going in to like a little college there. And you're like, you come in with me. Women will go into a rock in the middle of the ocean basically. I'm moving into a volcano. So she looks like a Hawaiian. Actually she's, she's, she's half Japanese. Oh, that's beautiful and convenient. So she looks like a local, so everyone thinks I am the holly and she's a local girl. Uh, so they think you snagged up a good one. I did, but they took one of their local girls.

Speaker 4:          01:39:06       So, so anyway. And, but it's funny because when I asked her to marry me and to move to Hawaii with me, it was like look like, like this is where I live. Like you're not from like, you're not really. She's not really from anywhere. She was like born in the east coast, like live all over the Midwest. Um, she moved a million different times, you know, her dad had for, for his work was moving all over the place and I went to high school and college in California. So when she moved to Hawaii she moved to La and she was in the entertainment business. So she was, she went from 10th gear to first gear, was like crazy downshift. So she's like, yeah, that'd be fine. That'd be, it'd be awesome. Where, you know, I'm like, I'll, I'll do whatever it takes. You're the right one.

Speaker 4:          01:39:46       You've got to move to Hawaii. We're going to do this, do this whole deal, the family life, the whole deal in Hawaii. Um, but she moved there and melted down. Yeah. Oh yeah. I had these terrifying moments where I thought I was going to have to move to la. Whoa. Yeah. And I would have, I would've done anything for her and, and I, and I told her, I'm like, Hey, the Hawaii thing doesn't work out with him, you know, I'll try and move to California. So what was the meltdown over, you know, just like, uh, her friends, her job, her life was all in La, right? Shelly? She left everything behind, sacrificed everything and move to where I live, where my family is, my friends and she didn't have any of that. So. And then, you know, she had a hard time for awhile, but as soon as she met a couple of friends and it was all good and now it's, you couldn't prior away from the place.

Speaker 4:          01:40:34       Now she loves it where I live. So she's a local girl now. Wow. That's interesting. But it took a while until, until she got friends there, she was like, the whole Hawaii thing was on thin ice. That's how it always is though, with people, you know, when you move to a new place, it's fucking hard to be alone. It's hard to be lonely. It's lonely. It's to meet people that you actually liked to. Oh yeah. Especially if you're from La, moved to Hawaii. It's like, you know, she's, she's not like a whole, she's not like a local, a local girl, you know, there's like a typical local girl. Um, and I don't get myself in hot water, but she wasn't one of those. She was, you know, she just had a hard time finding that first good friend. She was California nysed. Yes. Yeah. Well I would think that like activities like for you surfing, obviously you wouldn't meet other surfers.

Speaker 4:          01:41:25       A bowhunting, you'd meet other bowhunters, you find common ground, you'd make some friends if you had to move to a place like that. But if you don't have like a real obvious thing that you like to do that other people like to do as well. I would say that would become a real issue. It would. It would because you know, I think you feel like you lose your identity and that's the way to live and no you don't. You don't want to like move somewhere or live some life where you don't really know what's going on or don't know why you're doing what you're doing. For me it would be super hard to not be around comedians. Yeah. Like I'm so used to being around fucked up people that make jokes about everything and anything and comedians are just so unusual in the way they behave and you get used to them.

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       It becomes normal. You know, I'm used to being around the comedy store and places like that and just the sharpness and the quickness and that is that, that people's brains work in comedy or even just even just in La, just the pace of how quick people are thinking and talking and acting and being in living. Then you go to a place like Hawaii. It takes most people like three or four or five days or a week to just chill the hell out and relax a little bit. Yeah, just unwind. Maybe just on vacation and that's why the whole like bow hunting thing, like how good does it feel to just unplug your phone? It feels good. Good. Turn my phone off and leave it behind and I just. Awesome. Doesn't it also feel weird when you're a place that has no signals? There's nothing going on there.

Speaker 4:          01:42:49       There's no phone signal, there's no Wifi. It almost feels like the air feels different. The ultimate, uh, ultimate excuse though to why you can't get back to people because I'm terrible. I hate the phone. I hate it with a passion text message. Fine email. Okay. Fallen. No, don't call me. Oh, actual phone calls. Way Too into constantly interacting with all the time. I want to communicate when I want to communicate. That's my text messages. So good. It's like you can text someone and when they feel like they're gonna answer, no text messages is really good in that way. It's. I used to think text messages were stupid and now I think like phone calls are stupid for the most part, same even email. It's also you don't have enough time with people constantly being on their phone and constantly like being connected to things. You remember a time where there's reflection alone time, relaxing time, just thinking about shit. Yeah, you know, and that's, I think for me at least that's what I make a lot of my life decisions, like where I want to go or what direction

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       I want to go when I'm alone and I could just think about what's going on, what's, what's bugging me about my life. Like this is too busy, this is too much bullshit, this is too much hassle. I need to get the fuck away from that. And when I'm constantly on the grind, I don't think like that. My constantly on the grind, I'm like, God, I got to juggle this and then this is coming on and then that's coming up next. And that's what's appealing to me about a place like Hawaii is like there's no juggling man. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:44:17       yeah. That's great. It's a lot for most people though, you know, it's, it's, it's definitely different. It's definitely different. Yeah. Have you ever done a back country solo bow hunting trip?

Speaker 2:          01:44:30       I'm not solo. No. You have to. Yeah. You have to worry about fucking breaking my leg out in the middle of

Speaker 4:          01:44:36       or it's have to do it. I have to break my leg. No, no, bring a sat phone. Oh, okay. Yeah. Rent a sat phone. Yeah, the sat phone rental. Boom. You got your, you got your sat phone. You can call it. You can bring an iep or bring whatever safety stuff you want to do. Five day back country by yourself. Where do you go when you do those? I do at home. Doing home in Hawaii. You know, or I'll do it on Lanai or do you go? I do it around my house where there's vast open spaces where I live, so I can do it. You bring a temp in a lot of other places. You kinda sorta can't do it. I'm too, they're illegal or, or it's not. The areas aren't large enough to like just really get out, but yeah. Do the tent to the Super Ultra light thing.

Speaker 4:          01:45:18       I bring my own water, um, are all being. If there's water in the area, I'll bring upon whole deal ultra light bag, ultralight 10 ultra light. The whole, like all my sleeping gear. A lot of times I'll do the baby thing where you hunt all day and then you sleep wherever it gets dark, you know, and that's the best. But just the, uh, you know what you were saying about like, you know, being alone to think finally, it's like, I dunno, like even it's like we're so used to being entertained all the time. Yeah. And that's something that like people are addicted to, like whether it's your phone or even like if me and you went hunting a lot of time, I'd be your entertainment or you'd be my entertainment, but when no one's entertaining you and you're by yourself and you're just out there and you're making your own fires and you're waking up and, and you're doing your own hunt and you're not relying on a guide or a friend or, okay, I'm going to hunt over there.

Speaker 4:          01:46:06       You Hunt over here and you're just doing your own thing and even if you're not even a hunting, just being silent, you're not talking to yourself so you're not talking to anybody. You're not talking to your phone, you're not communicating with anyone. And after four or five days I did this at home, I did a hunt where I left my house, had my wife, dropped me off and I ended this long walk over this giant mountain, bad idea, but it was awesomely fun and I camped out for like four days and I ended up hurting my leg really bad. I like pulled a muscle behind my knee and I was planning on going back and having my wife picked me up again and I'm halfway there and normally you have no service in this area. It's like a black zone and so I hiked to an area where I just, I found service and I couldn't walk back.

Speaker 4:          01:46:54       I was, I was too screwed up. My knee was screwed up. Anyway, I called my friend who had access to enroll to, to a ranch at the very top of this ranch. I could walk to it. So it was like another day's walk and a whole day walking. Yeah, with a fucked up leg. Yeah. Slowly walking and I called him and I said, hey, you know, can you pick me up on Tuesday at the rat? And he's like, yeah, I'm going to be up there anyway, I can come pick you up at the top. And so he picks me up and after five days he got out of the, out of the car and he was talking to me like I'm talking to you. And it sounded like he was yelling at me. Oh Wow. Yeah. So weird as, so used to like this silence that was, sounded like he was yelling at me and I was like staring at him. I must've been looking at them really well,

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       we're like, but you gotta do you got to be

Speaker 4:          01:47:46       by yourself? Totally alone with no, like no communication for like at least three days. Do you know? Just for, just for good experience.

Speaker 3:          01:47:54       Do you know Adam Green Tree is from Australia? I do, yeah. I was hunting with them just maybe a month ago. Oh, okay. Cool, well he, he's a good buddy of mine. We've been bear hunting before he hung out with them and cap been great. Great Guy. Hung out with them in Australia when I was there for the UFC to. He is a killer. It is a bad ass hunter. He's a bad ass on. He's, he's just a bad ass dude. But he was telling me that when he goes off to these trips because he does most of his hunt solo and that's like really, really weird. He detaches and you like centers himself, but he says he comes back after being out there for eight or nine days and he hasn't said a word in eight or nine days. He says it just feels weird to talk to people. Yeah, yeah. Just feels weird to say words.

Speaker 4:          01:48:36       Yeah, it does. And it's, it's cool man. It puts a lot of shit and perspective about what you're planning on doing and you know, the next 10 years or what's happening in your life or you know, whatever it is, you know, not to get deep in here, but it's, it's a trip man. It really is. I did, I did, I did nine days by myself in Colorado back country. Do yourself in a tent. It's snow for five of the days. Where'd you go? Um, one time I went and, uh, kind of in the mountains near Breckenridge. And then another time I went in a mountain range called the Santa Santa Decristo mountains. It's in the southern part of the state in some steep shit, some really gnarly stuff and hike like eight miles back with my ultra light stuff. And I had hunted that area with a buddy of mine from home the year before and we plan on going again and then he kicked out last second because he couldn't make it. So I was just like, screw it, I got a ticket, I got tagged, I'm going by myself. So I rented a sat phone just in case and I went there and I'm like, the second day I walked like eight miles back, like as a bird flies, right? So it's like a really long walk and uh, but that's where the elk were

Speaker 3:          01:49:43       meaning long walk for people. Look at what was that as the bird flies, if you go in a straight line, it's eight

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       miles, but you're going up and down, up and down. So it's way more than

Speaker 4:          01:49:51       I parked at like 8,500 feet and camped at 10,500 feet, which is the highest water I could combat. Right. Wow. And the elk were at like 11,500 feet. So it was a lot of hiking, a lot of walking and just being by yourself. And then, and then the snow component for somebody from Hawaii, you know, it's like it was snowing every day and I was cooking in my tent and eating and it's snowing and an elk were coming in at night and screaming her guts out. And um, then there was like a crazy, like lightning storm and windstorm attic at a pack of my tent the middle of the night, if that was going to blow over, I thought is going to hit me out of go into like a dense a pine forest and reset up my 10 mil night during a lightning storm.

Speaker 4:          01:50:29       Call my wife and I in the middle of the night and like, you know, let her know exactly where I was just in case the shit hit the fan, but that type of stuff is um, you know, a lot of barriers in that area and why anzalone shit. So, um, those type of experience for, for. I didn't never had those kinds of experiences before I started hunting ever. I never saw a stat, that kind of country. I never, I never put myself in those kinds of situations. And, and until I found bowhunting, that's, that's a reason I was never like, I'm going to go hiking, not a hiker. I need to have like a purpose when I'm hiking. Right? So I'm basically like a hiker with a bow these days and that's what gets me out to these kinds of places and had the, some of the best experiences of my life just because I found bow hunting.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       Well those, those woods and like where you're going these places where you're not going to run into any other people, there's, there's a feeling that you get from those, those environments. It's almost like a loneliness in a way, like a or almost like a. it's all right because it's so beautiful and so incredible, but it's also, it's humbling and a bunch of different ways. One of the ways it's humbling because this woods doesn't give a fuck about you. Have you died? It's like, so what? I am. Grizzlies keep fucking eating elk. Keep having sex and screaming their heads off and birds keep flying and that's just how we've always done it. Dude. Sorry, you didn't make it. Yeah, does. You're right. It doesn't care.

Speaker 4:          01:51:52       And you're alone, like alone, alone in the dark night seems darker. You know, the silent seems more silent. Oh yeah. Way More. You know, you get back to your tent and it's dark. What's the big perspective enhancer? Yeah, it is.

Speaker 2:          01:52:07       I went to Prince of Wales last year. We, uh, we hunted on Prince of Wales Island outside of Alaska. It's fucking rained everyday. Just miserable every day. And Moose, uh, we were hunting. Deer were hunting sickle blacktail very cool. But I'm unsuccessful. We didn't, we struck out. But when we came back hard, it's hard. It's real hard. There's not, a lot of them were we were, uh, we, we, we fucked up. We got to a place where they had already moved down towards the water and we were up high. Were you with cameras at hunt? No, that was with Rinella. That was for the mediator show. But one of the things about it was that feeling of like, almost like a sadness look, so, and gorgeous,

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       like it would rain every day, but every now and then the sun would come up and when the sun would come up, the sun would hit this incredible green. It would just, it was like an illuminating like this, like it was lit up and um, we can, we got back after seven days of this or however many days or six days and everything in La seems so nice. Was so warm and beautiful and I just loved it. I was so happy and uh, I called Rinella up and I was like, dude, I don't think I've ever been happier in my life. I am so happy. And it's because I was so miserable for those days. And that that's another perspective enhancer to realize like, you're so God damn lucky I have a roof overhead and that you know, you can listen to the radio in your car and then you could, you know, you can get around and it's easy and you could talk to be blowing your phone when you're out in the woods.

Speaker 3:          01:53:38       Woods, no cell phone service, no nothing. There's nothing. We have Amazon packages come into your house and like food delivery and nothing. No Pizza. You can order pizza. There's fucking nothing, man. We brought some food with us and that is what we ate because we struck out and the cold and the wet, the wet until you've been head to toe soaking wet and your boots and your socks and your pants and your rain gear and everything is everything that's supposed to keep you warm and safe from the elements is soaked to the bone and it's getting cold. That's gnarly. Well, that's also where you appreciate really good gear to Merino wool. Right? You know, a will is a weird cloth in that like if you have cotton on and you get wet, you're fucked. But if you have wool on and you get wet, the wool actually retains the heat so you could be wet and still warm, which is really unusual and hard for people to understand.

Speaker 3:          01:54:35       If you've never worn wool, well that's when you know what I mean. The the right gear, you know as a lot of hunts that really you don't really need the right gear for printing, but in that back country stuff or real steep mountains or stuff where you have to walk far, if your shoes are wet and your socks are wet, you're going to have an earliest blisters and you won't be able to walk anywhere. That's why I'm really fascinated by companies like cool you that spend all this time developing the most technical gear, like the lightest weight, the best at absorbing wind for their tents and, and you know, they'd go through great lengths to engineer their products to make sure that it's just mean. It's a giant company that just makes ultra light gear for hunting. Yeah. It's kind of crazy that there's a company like that. Yeah. But yeah, you can see why when you go in the back country, don't have the right gear, you, that's the last kind of hunting you're going to do like that and how it's like a survival thing. How'd you figure out like what stuff to bring and what stuff not to bring? Did you read up or did you do trial and error? You know? Uh, I, right when I got into bow hunting, I got, I got bored of, of feeding pigs and have want to come to my house

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       and, and having them come to my trees down. I got bored of that pretty quick. It was Super Fun at first and I loved it and it was a really good learning and it was a blast. You know, it's building tree stands by myself, but I what? I super quickly got bored of that and wanting to do something else. I wanted to go walk in the mountains all day long and I, I ordered Cameron Hanes is back country bowhunting book. This is right when I started hunting, I had no idea who cameron hanes was and I was geeking out on everything. Hunting and I, I did some research, found that book ordered, it changed my life. I got like, and it's funny because I told Cameron that I, I told them that, uh, that I got his book and it like fully inspired me. I, uh, I ordered like the, the ultralight tent, the right one to all this research on which one to get which one is lightest, which one's the driest, which one is the best at cooking, which is that the biggest vestibule. I ordered the right, the right stove and all the right, you know, ultra light plates and forks and caps, camp cups and a sleeping bags and tout the, the little talent packs up tiny on the pillow that packs of tiny in the right backpack and all that stuff. So it's funny because that, that, you know, when you're shading ounces and it really adds up, you know, it's like a difference between like 80 pound pack and a 40 pound pack when you

Speaker 3:          01:57:02       get, if you get the right gear. Jason Harrison, the owner, if he makes a, uh, a spreadsheet where he ways every single thing he's, he's bringing and he packs it up and he weighs like what's in each pack and what he needs for each and he has this like this excel spreadsheet of all the different stuff and then that's how seriously people take it. Especially like sheep hunting and things on those lines. I got so geeked out on the ultralight thing that I started like looking at all of that, like um, like ultra light, ultra light hiking websites and like getting all it

Speaker 1:          01:57:36       tips. Like, like instead of just bringing in like a little spark, you know, one of those like little sport, the ultralight sports, you'd cut your fork in half or even like in just one third. So you just had the fork, just a fork part. So like you'd, you'd, you'd shave off those ounces of the rest of the fork. You just be the part where you just ate, you know, and, and your toothbrush, you cut it. So it was just the part that goes on, doesn't your

Speaker 3:          01:58:00       teeth. Yeah, that's what Adam does. He was telling me he does that pretty funny, but plus I'm a manly man. I can carry a toothbrush handle. It's funny though because it all adds up when you, when you know you don't think you need that much stuff to go in the back country hunt, but a lot of times you put every single thing you're going to put in that pack and it's a lot of stuff. Right. And to share those out, this down means then you can bring like a better 10 better sleeping bag. Right. You add up some more ounces on the other side. I, I'm a big eater so I'll bring a lot of food and water and you know. Now do you weigh out your food? Do you make sure that you have like intense calorie dense food? Yeah. What kind of stuff do you bring with you when you go on a back country hunt of. Oh, stuff you get bored of quick.

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       Like um, I bring like nuts, like macadamia nuts and almonds and pecans and cheese and jerky and stuff like that. And if they're, especially if there's water, that's a game changer. If there's water where you're going to be, or even anywhere near where you going to be that are bringing stove every time with oatmeal and freeze dried meals like mountain house meals, those are insane. You have to try a dehydrated. Yeah. Those are the same ones. Yeah. But there's a freeze dried. The dehydrated is apparently lighter. That's why people are gravitating towards dehydrated now. Gotcha. Doesn't own a house there. So light. I don't know how anyone can be lighter than that while you're shaving the handle of your toothbrush. That's right. The best space to. Yeah. I think that is what they're saying. Yeah. That takes up less space. But there's certain certain things that I can't skimp on, like food.

Speaker 4:          01:59:31       But uh, you know, what's really good is when you like, before I do hunt like that, I'll make like two handfuls of Bacon and I'll make it all up and then I'll bring that and it's like, that's my treat at lunch. I'll have a couple pieces of bacon. Doesn't it go bad? No, it Kinda doesn't. It doesn't. Once, once you get, once you cook it, it depends where you hunt. Also, if you're hunting and in Arizona in the summer, then maybe a or somewhere by the beach in Hawaii probably go bad, but a normal hunt if you're, if your stuff doesn't get super hot and all was fine. How long has cooked Bacon last? No, I got that idea I think from Karen and his book because he would make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with Bacon in it. Oh yeah. And uh, and so I would do that.

Speaker 4:          02:00:12       I don't know how long it lasts, but don't tell me if it's. But I, I bring it for like a five day hunt. No worries. And just thinking at least the first three days, once you start getting diarrhea then you cut back. Exactly. But, but uh, um, what was I going to say? Oh, because I don't know. I just craved the fats. It's like I'm eating, I'm eating all these nuts, bars, nuts in bars, nuts and bars, not bars and all I want is fat like Greece. But when you're doing heavy duty climbing and things along those lines are going up and down mountains. That is what you crave. Yeah. Like you're not in the carbohydrates, fats your body go like we need something. Coward. Dance. Oh yeah. And then when I, when I leave hunting, when I leave the mountains, like say I go to Colorado and I hunt for a week and I'm like I lose 10 pounds, get super skinny and like mountain man style, I get out of there and I just want like a bacon double cheeseburger, like a big giant, not like the kind of the fast food place, but like a big, like 30 pound Burger with a ton of Bacon on it with like blue cheese and Avocados on it.

Speaker 4:          02:01:08       Yeah, just a massive fat go giant and just blow my, blow my self sky high with a giant thing of fries and that's always what I created with the amount of calories that you're burning when you're climbing up and down mountains all the time. It's insane. And it's thousands of calories a day. You literally have to keep stuffing your face just to maintain your body mass. Yeah, you do. Well, if you are a person who is doing this on a regular basis, I mean you would get really good at preparing for these things, so you must have

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       undergone a transformation where you started off sort of kind of like trying to figure it out and then as you got better and better and better, you got more and more streamlined in you in your approach. Like do you feel like you have it down to a science now? If you want to do something like that with what the actual backcountry hunt or the actual hunting, it's all the old stuff. You're packing your plan. Do you ever use Google maps? Oh yeah. That's pretty cool that you can do a phone these days. Yeah, it's amazing. What would people do if you don't know they, they find an area like say if you draw a tag for an area, he'd get her over. This is not for you, for people, isn't it? Obviously, but you get an overhead. Google earth will give you. It'll show you where the peaks and valleys are and it's amazing. It shows you the canyons, it shows you water sources and you see from a satellite image, so you can literally see elk sometimes on Google Earth, which is incredible.

Speaker 4:          02:02:34       Yeah, and you can really like, you know, you can get back to your camp much more, much quicker. A lot of time, you know, don't get lost in a dark, you know, you can get to your water source wave way quicker and it's really efficient. But then you need to bring batteries to for your phone or. Yeah, know some solar panel, but I haven't really found a super efficient solar panel that'll charge up your phone in here. Stuff that fast. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:02:55       Especially when you're in the woods, you're not getting a lot of sunlight. There always seems like it doesn't work as good as you hope. Yeah. They're getting better at those things they're getting. I mean if you're in Arizona, know when you're in this, of course, mule deer hunting in the desert. You've got a great shot at charging a patient. Leave it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:03:11       One place for like a few hours just sitting there in the sun. Yeah, for sure. But as far as the hunting goes, like you have gotten better at the planning and the and the back country gear, but that's all I got. I think you learn that pretty quick, but you found out you find out if your shitty hunter right away because you come home with no meat all the time. Right? Yeah. It's like it's very easy. It's like it's like finding out if you're good at the stock market, you know right away you get that feedback, you lose a bunch of money all the time. Right. It's the same thing with bow hunting. I love going hunting because I didn't grow up in a hunting family. I have no background in it when I was young. So I don't have like those, like the instincts like that someone would have like that.

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       I've really good friends that grew up with a bow in their hand and their dad did in. Their GRANDPA did and they're great. GRANDPA did actually one family in particular, but I'm so good at bowhunting. I love bow hunting with those guys. Like guys like Adam Green tree guys like my, my buddy justin at home. I have my friend Jason on Lanai who hunts axis deer. These are like half year, half human, you know how to hunt, how to kill wind to move, how fast you can move, how slow, like when to slow down, when to run. It's just, I love it. I as I'm absolutely obsessed with like trying to learn to get better at it.

Speaker 2:          02:04:23       Now. Have you taken into the archery lessons? Have you ever gone to like a, like how did you learn how to shoot correctly?

Speaker 4:          02:04:30       Um, I didn't, I learned how to shoot terribly and then I had to relearn ever since I've been trying to correct it. So still now I now I'll shoot with guys who are really good archers and now they'll help me know. Um, so I've done a lot of work with that, but I still like, my effective range is still like 50 yards. I've tried for a long time. Thirteen years. Yeah. That's tried really hard. You when you practice, how do you feel a targeted. I can kill a target at 70. No worries. But it's so different, you know, like guys I can say that they to shoot 60, you should be shooting 122 to be able to be effective at 60. Should be shooting hundred 20 because of the pressure of the nerves. Yeah. There's a difference between a target and an animal just so totally different.

Speaker 4:          02:05:13       So it was also the way you shoot too, right? Do you use a, a trigger or using these? A thumb release. So you usually use a lot of attention and what kind of release you using? I got target panic if you ever heard of that. Sure. Yeah, that's why I asked you socks. You don't want to not want to get that. But uh, I, I hunted for years and then recently my friend was filming and as I would shoot I would punch a trigger like crazy and I didn't even realize I was doing it. It got worse and worse to the point where I ended up giving my releases away and stop hunting for about four months. And all I did was go and shoot. I put this target right outside my front door, like a hanging bag target and I would, I'd walk up to it, draw my bow like a one foot away from it and just practice releasing over and over and over with your eyes closed than my eyes closed so I wouldn't focus on any aiming or anything.

Speaker 4:          02:06:01       It was like a psychology thing where you have to break down your break it down. We came down into like the perfect release. Yeah, that's called blind bail shooting for people don't know what it is is impact, bracing your. Your mind gets used to the feeling of the bomb going off and so you brace for it and when you do that you start to develop these sorts of patterns where you're anticipating the shot. It's crazy and it can really fuck your head up really can and I couldn't. It got so bad to where I couldn't put my pin on the animal and my finger on the trigger without punching it. I couldn't do both. I had to put my finger, my, my, my pin off the animal, and then my finger on the trigger and then got extreme and then once the trigger or what's the pin is near the animal.

Speaker 4:          02:06:43       Then you just hit it early. Nervous. Yeah. It was really bizarre. And this is weird because you're such A. I mean, you're a bad motherfucker. You're dealing with giant waves and yeah, you're, you're fucking surfing 50 foot high waves. If someone told me that was going to happen to me, I would've just, I would've bet my life savings against it. I'm totally not that guy like freaks out and gets panicked out loud. Stuff like that. Especially like a pin on a boat like. Yeah, like break. Yeah. And Man, I had to work through it for a little while. There's, there's people who like give up archery all together. Oh yeah. It's super common. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so I read a lot about it. I'm terrified of it. Yeah. Don't even worry about it. Just just do your thing and keep hunting and what you're doing. But I've learned how to shoot with back tension. So I get a surprise shot. It's all the time. I don't, I don't use a trigger, but cam diseases triggers. But he, he worked through it to everybody works through it. Yeah. When you, um, when you learned

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       how to use a thumb trigger and use back tension, is something you got from youtube videos or did you have someone show you how to do it? Yeah, I had a friend show me how to do it. I've, I've a really good friend from Spain. Um, his name is Pedro. I don't know if you know him and he's super, Super Pedro from Spain, from Spain. Okay. So there's a, there's a few of them in Spanish. That's what I heard a few Pedro's down there. Anybody Jose's to a bad ass bowhunter yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:07:59       That ass and really good archer. So He. So he, he suggested,

Speaker 3:          02:08:05       you know, like a back tension release. And let me explain what works for people who have no idea what we're talking about. Um, when you're, there's a type of release that has, uh, when you sort of set your stem on it, but you don't squeeze it with your thumb, will, you do, is you need to know what I release it, right? It's something that connects to the string on your bow. It actually connects to what's called a d loop, which connects to the string. There you go. There's a bunch of. Well those are back tension releases where those are like real back tension release where very few people ever use those for hunting. But I like what, what kind of release you use, what brand is? I think it's a Carter release. Yeah, I do too. I use a carter, but it's mainly back tension. Like I'll like, I'll exactly like that. Like I'll put my thumb around the trigger and then I'll just keep pulling until it goes off. It goes off when you never know when it's going off. So because of that you're not anticipating but in a, in a it. But it keeps coming back like in a, in a situation where I'm hunting when I'm 25 yards and I'm getting full drawn and deer

Speaker 4:          02:09:02       and it's perfectly broadside. I had this overwhelming feeling like it wants to move and I'll then now I have like sorta like trained myself to like slowly squeeze, squeeze and pull so that

Speaker 3:          02:09:12       it makes it go quicker. They say you should have like a mantra as in your head as well, that you should have a bunch of things that you say like line it up and release the air like that. You have to have like some sort of a thing that you put in your head and you probably wouldn't, shouldn't say release the Arrow. What's yours? Execute the shot. Yeah. Yeah. One. Yeah. Line it up and execute the shot. That's what I say. Lined it up.

Speaker 4:          02:09:33       Execute the shot. Yeah. You know what I do

Speaker 3:          02:09:36       stay calm too. That's the other one. I say stay calm. Breathe. Breathe.

Speaker 4:          02:09:41       Um, I do that thing where I, I spell lock. So Loc K as I'm settling, you know, you get to full draw. Get my anchor. I, I've, I start settling the pin and I look at my, my, my bubble level and once my little checklist is online and I'm on the animal, as soon as I feel like my, my pin starts to relax and steady. I spelled the word lock and squeezes the same time. Ooh, I liked that. I might steal that. Yeah. You know what else you're going to like. This is my, my friend Jeff who basically taught me how to bow hunt. I'm Jeff Lee. Guys, Legend. He's awesome. Uh, he, he told me that when he is a full draw right before he pulls the trigger, he says, you're gonna die motherfucker. Whoa, that's deep. Yeah. I don't know if I liked that, what he told me, but he's not like that. He's not like that. Like you would never think

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       that. He's not like, he's totally not blood thirsty. He's a super ethical hunter. He just goes, man, it's, it's a psychological thing. He goes, if you are hoping you're going to hit that animal, that release, when that Arrow goes off, if you're hoping you're not going to hit him, you're not going to kill him. It's not going to be an efficient, ethical, ethical shot, but he goes, if you truly believe that you're there to kill that animal and that animal is going to die, right then that's a huge piece of the puzzle. There's a website called iron mind hunting. Have you ever heard of this? Scott? Think I forget his name, Joel something or another, but he, um, he suffered through target panic himself and he's a swat guy and a police officer and developed a whole system understanding the impact bracing and a whole system that I haven't, I haven't read it.

Speaker 3:          02:11:22       He's got a book on it and he's got, there it is. Um, and he's got Joel Turner and he's got a whole website dedicated to controlling target, panic and develop a whole system. Yeah, I have to check it out too. And it's one of those things where, you know, no matter how long you been doing it, it's possible that this shit could creep into your brain, which is weird, like people have been successful hunting for years and years and then all of a sudden they get target panic and they're fucked. Almost everybody you meet who's bow hunted for a couple of decades has had it almost everybody. Everybody from randy elmer to, to everybody. Yeah, Randy Alma has a couple of good videos on how to handle it too. And he, he says you should use a back tension release to get used to it and a or a hinge release.

Speaker 3:          02:12:07       And what that is for the people don't understand what we're talking about. There's another type of release. It doesn't have a trigger at all. And what you do is you draw back and just by moving your hand, you're sort of curling your pinky down and making a fist. It goes off, but you never know when it's going off, it goes off completely unanticipated. And that helps you deal with this, this tension issue, this, uh, this fucking mind. Fuck yeah. But I got over the hump and I'm back. You're back. I had a good 2016 so far. Yes. Feels good, right? I, I, it feels good. As I was panicking about the panic for awhile and this year started off good. I've done it. I've done quite a bit of hunting. I went, uh, I went hunting for fallow deer with, with, with Remy and New Zealand, and had a, just an absolute ball.

Speaker 3:          02:12:54       Killed a great, a great book. I saw some pictures of the terrain. You're using that crazy equivalent thing too, right? Where it's a stabilizer. And I tried that for awhile, but it kept getting loose on me. Oh really? Yeah. It was wiggling around too much. I didn't have that problem writing it down too much and it worked really good for that hunt, that specific hunt. But we wanted in this awesome terrain with this crazy rocks and cliffs. There was not one Bush, there was no bushes there. There's no trees in this area. It was just like you had to use the, you had to use the, you know, the rocky, the rocky outcroppings, and just the basic like terrain features to get close and we ended up sneaking down on this bed of group of deer that was at the base of this

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       cliff. Go Get up. Go to Ben. Oh, Brian's a instagram. What is instagram? A steep. It was such a steep downhill shot that I had to like, you know, when you're shooting down, you got to you gotta bend at the waist, you can just aim down miss. And so I had to remember all that stuff in the moment. It was just a really technical shot and a technical stock. It was really a lot of fun. Well, Ben took a photo. The reason why I said go to Ben's instagram because he took a Benny Aubrey or something like that. Um, he, he has a photo of you doing it where it looks like you're shooting from the top of a building. Oh yeah, down to the first floor. Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy picture. Yeah. And that's the kind of, that's the kind of, um, practice that you'd never do.

Speaker 4:          02:14:13       A lot of people don't like set their target the bottom of a cliff and stand at the top and it's really different or shooting up either. Yeah, either one of the super different type of shot. So, but that was a lot of fun and I've done some really good hunts. I did one to threatening in New Zealand. I did one with Adam Green tree in eastern Australia. Um, and what did you guys hunt and Australia? We hunted in an area that had, um, fallow deer mainly. There was a couple red stags around to, um, but that was a ball. We had a lot, a lot of fun. He's trying to get me to go hunt water buffaloes were going. I'm like, fuck. He's been trying to get me to do that to these things are, they're just giant fucking murderous beasts. Yeah, that's not the part that to me is, uh, is the, uh, I love hunting in the mountains where it's cold and beautiful and I'm looking at a big valley or over the ocean in Hawaii. Or you can see the ocean, the white caps and boats going by like just beautiful, right. Beautiful wilderness. And where are those bulls live? It's like 50 million flies on you and mosquitoes in a swamp and snake and snakes and slugs and spiders. FOC degrees and crocs. Yeah. And it's true man. It's like I turned it a little pussy when I come to those guys. I can't. I turn it a little pussy when I look at pictures of it. Yeah. He's like, you gotta come to the buffet thing, right? You've got to come. And I'm like,

Speaker 3:          02:15:37       sure thing. I will for sure. Good luck with all that. Now human campaigns, when they brought no food and they brought no water, they said, mate, we're going to do it the right way. So they go out there and they were bathing in this fucking lake that they didn't realize had crocodiles. Yeah. So they were in up to their neck cooling themselves off and then later on found out the crocodiles at slipped into this lake. So they easily could have gotten eaten. Yeah. I mean, these are some of the biggest fucking crocodiles in the world that live right there. Fuck that.

Speaker 4:          02:16:08       I was hunting or with another body in Australia and we were hunting in an area that crocodiles and everyday we had to, we had to cross a couple of little areas that had water and I just didn't even think about it because I'm not like I'm not around crocodiles. Right. And he just, after the first day he didn't really worry about it too much because he had, after we crossed, he goes, hey, if I'm not with you tomorrow and you cross here, make sure you throw a bunch of rocks in the water right there to make sure there's no crocodiles. Because if they, if, if a human passes by an area where there's crocodiles over and over and over, they pattern them and they will sit there and wait for that human to cross again and get ya. Oh. So they're super intelligent hunters. So that's what they do.

Speaker 4:          02:16:49       They actually wait for like, whether it's a rabbit going by everyday or human or whatever it is, a dog, a cat, and they will sit there and wait just underwater and when you go by, that's when they strike. So such an efficient animal to the fact that they could just stay under water for hours without breathing. They slow their heart rate down like a beat, a minute or something stupid. There's A. There's a place in northwestern Australia where the waves are really good and in that area there's a ton. A ton of great whites. Tiger sharks and ocean. Saltwater crocodiles swim in the ocean for miles. They swim. They fight the sharks. Fuck them. Fuck everything. Fuck that whole. The whole God. That's so crazy. Yeah. They swim. Imagine being in the fucking water in a canoe and you look over and there's something bigger than you can do and it's a dinosaur.

Speaker 4:          02:17:40       Yeah. It's swimming in the water and it wants to kill you. It's hungry. Oh my on. You'll Australia's a wild ass place, but it really is beautiful and crazy and wild. Seems like New Zealand's a better spot though. New Zealand doesn't have any of that stuff and I'm from a place like New Zealand. Right. I'm from Hawaii. There's no snakes. We don't have deadly spiders or anything like that. And when I go to Australia I get so freaked out about the snakes, so freaked out and have those brown snakes it kill you instantly. I almost stepped on one of those. Fuck, I literally fuck you in green tree trying to get me to come to your house. My partner was. My foot was up, my left. What was that? I remember I was walking through this, this grass called tussock and it was in, you know, Adam was like, you're never going to see a snake at this time of year.

Speaker 4:          02:18:27       It's like winter time. Right. So they're all, they're all down, whatever they're doing, they're hibernating. Right. And so I'm walking by myself, of course, and I almost put my foot down and I looked down as a coiled up brown snake just. And he was, he was out sunning himself and almost stepped right on. I'm one of those red belly black snakes. The thing was that thing called right past me. One day I was with my other buddy and he goes, you're never going to see any snakes. I never seen any snakes around here. First afternoon, I swear to God, first after unit ever hunted on Australia. This guy just told me, you never see a snake like an hour into our hunt, maybe less. He goes, don't move. There's a deer. Does it dear mate. So I just stopped. Of course. Right. I didn't even say a word. I was looking around for the deer side side, eyeing it, you know, trying not to say we're trying to be completely still. And he goes, okay, now look down. I looked down and the giant snake had just passed me completely deadly. So he said, don't move just because he didn't want you freaking out because I just a snake out of flipped.

Speaker 3:          02:19:29       Yeah. But he goes, there's a deer. And he knew. I said, Billy Black snake, nothing looks awesome. I'd like to make a belt out of one. Those fucks. Yeah. There's plenty in Australia. You can bow hunt. Can you make a belt? Oh yeah. Probably make a pair of boots that go with it. Other than that, no, because she'd had a few of them. Like you shoot all you want. I give you permission to go straight and shoot them all. Well that's the thing about Australia is like you could kinda just shoot animals constantly. They have special makes. Yeah. No one's going to be bummed out. You shoot a snake. God Damn. What a beautiful looking creature. Incredibly beautiful creatures. They're so shiny. I saw like a 10 foot python to hunting. Really scary. They have python. I'm so freaked out about snakes. They have giant pythons, giant, giant pythons.

Speaker 3:          02:20:14       Someone was like 10 feet long and my buddy almost stepped right on him too. What is the average stocking dear? We're stocking right next to these giant bucks and there's giant 10 foot snake right next to how fat was it? Like as fat as my forearm. Jesus Christ. Fucking big. I was running with my dogs once in the hills and we ran over what I thought was a log and A. I just ran right over it. I ran over it and then as my foot is passing over at Mike, I go, oh fuck, that's a giant. Rattlesnake was a huge rattlesnake. Like literally, I mean not quite as big as my upper forearm but definitely as big as my wrist and it was easily seven right here by your house here, right over here? Yeah, they're fucking. There's a few of them up here that are biggest shit.

Speaker 3:          02:21:02       It was here. Which big ass diamond head and no big ass triangle head. I was like, look at the size of this fucking thing and I'm like defenseless, like mentally defenseless because I don't even know. I don't know how to react to snakes. I don't know what to do. I don't know where they live. I don't know what they hide under. Usually I don't having snake background so I'm not like looking. Thank you. Diet. Rattlesnake killed. Look at the size of this one. This one is like fucking 12 feet long. Yeah. Where this guy killed this thing. Mexico. It looks like. Oh my God, look how fat it is. 30 yard shot. Guaranteed. I would definitely take it all day long for that day. He was 30 yards away, smoke it with expandables. Right. Like a rage. Right. Do you use a fixed head broadhead or these expandable.

Speaker 3:          02:21:43       So look at the size of that one. Jesus Christ. That's bigger than the one I've run across over at least semi. That's a big ass snake. That's, you know. Thanks. Yeah, I use fix heads mainly. Yeah. I use like these little vpa heads, a vantage point. Archery makes these like little two bladed, um, same one. Um, but they're all machined out of one piece of steel. So they're, they're very strong. They're very like, uh, there's a super reliable heads and they fly. Well yeah, there's a big debate in the archery world. Expandable broadheads versus fixed head. What we're talking about folks is like expandables as they go in these blades open up on the side, they're like a mechanical

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       blade, but sometimes they fail and they break off when they hit ribs and stuff like that. And there, there, there's some animals that they're better on I think. But I've used rages a bit and I've had really good luck with them actually. I've had friends that were like, Oh man, I can't do the rage thing anymore. But I've had super good luck with them where they're making hybrids now to look as he makes a hybrid and then then those, so, so grave diggers where it's a fixed head blade and then two other blades open up behind it, which is actually probably even better than just a regular fixed blade. It totally depends on what you're hunting too. Because like where I live on access to your access to deer were brought from Sri Lanka there. They're from Sri Lanka and India. So there's like an Asian deer and their main Predator in like in like Borneo and we're.

Speaker 4:          02:23:15       And we're, we're there from in a, in all those countries there was a bengal tiger. So if you look up the history of access deer, it's mean Predator for thousands of years of Bengal tiger. Wow. So they have, they have like a vertical leap, like a crazy vertical leap and they run like super fast and they always jump. You're Arielle right? They always, they always jumped the string. Yeah, so when they jumped the string to you, aim low so they ducked down. You catch them when they're tough thing down, super low, and if they're alert most of the time you came off their body. So if they don't see you and they don't see you release your Arrow, do you still aim low? Aim Low. The sound. It makes them react down. They react like super, super, hyper fast. So what? What? I don't. The reason I brought it up is because those mechanicals are really good, especially on access to here because even if you make a perfect shot, like a fear, just incredible archer, like someone like Cameron Hanes, you're 40 yards, you're just rock solid, not nervous.

Speaker 4:          02:24:10       You can make the perfect shot. That animal could be completely spin around into one 80 and you hit him in the other side. He hit him in, you know you can make a gut shot even though you made a perfect shot just because they move. So in those kinds of situations I think, you know, biggest boundable is, is really good, you know, because if you hit him badly, those, those things cut giant holes, you know? Yeah. They cut giant holes and cam shot a bear with a, one of those grave diggers. It's one of those hybrid blades would, has a large fixed blade, but then as these two really big expandables that go to a, an inch and three quarters and it just opened up a shot, like a 300 win mag. Yeah. It was a huge holes. The difference in the bear rather. And they still get the crazy penetration.

Speaker 4:          02:24:53       Yeah. Well he's shooting 80 pounds to and you know, with those really thin, a Fmj deep six injection arrows. What uh, what kind of boat are you shooting with? I should have Mathews Halon six of those are great posts. That's what Ben has. St Mary quiet silent. So the six is the one with the sixth and spray site, which is. So it's a little jumpy, right? It's like the Turbo Cam. They have a five or six and a seven. I believe. So the five is like the junk, you know, the fastest one, but it's probably not easy to shoot. So like with all speed beaus I think the shorter the brace height, the Fascia they'd go, but they're, you know, my understanding is that I'm not like the Super Archer guidance. Um, but my understanding is that the longer that brace height in general, that the more forgiving the is to shoot.

Speaker 4:          02:25:38       We just got into technical geek talk and people in their cars right now. Fast forward to the next subject. Yeah. We, I geek out on Bozeman. I kick out on all sorts of gear. I'm, I'm just, I'm a fan of all the, like the little tiny things that make a difference. Yeah. And you should avoid and make good bows. Yeah. Yeah. Are Good. Defining carbon defiant. Eighty pounds. So fucking flame thrower, man. Yeah, no kidding. I love it. They fling some arrows out fast. Yeah. I'm just so obsessed with it. I practice almost too much. I really have a real issue. We were talking about the new studio that we're setting up or it has a 50 yard indoor range. One of the reasons why I got it coming back over next time I bring my belt. Um, so do you have anything planned that you're really looking forward to and he.

Speaker 4:          02:26:28       Big Hunter. You're planning? Uh, I have nothing to promote on. The show has. No, no, no, no, no. Come on. I have a book coming out or a movie. If they do, that's cool. If they don't, that's better. It's not, it's not bad one way or another yet. The thing tonight and. Well that's fine too, but I just wanted to talk to you things I do. I do have a lot of coming up. I have some Rad surf trips. I served for a company called Billabong. That's my major. My major sponsor. They make clothes and tee shirt on right now. Yeah. So I write it. I have written for them forever and they're awesome. But they have a really good amateur team, like their, you know, their, their best youngest averages from around the world to ride for Billabong. They activate them and take them on a couple trips a year.

Speaker 4:          02:27:08       So they're taking them to Bali. And so I'm going to Bali to go in and help mentor them, surf with them, help train them and help get them ready for like the next step. Right. So I'm bringing my son, my son is nine. He likes to surf so I'm actually going to go to Bali is a first time that's ever happened and I'm going to go to Bali for a work trip, which I do that pretty often and go, go on surf trips that are really a work trip. Um, but now I get to bring my son because he likes to surf, which is really, really cool. Wow. That's bad ass. Yeah. So he might. My son, now that he, he likes to Skateboard, he's little skater rot rat. And I tried. I was, I hope that he'd be in the surfing, you know, because that's what I love to do and now they'd like to surf.

Speaker 4:          02:27:47       I'm just so stoked. And now I'm taking them to Bali. So do you think he's going to try bowhunting? He already balanced. Really? He's nine bow hunts. Has He been successful? Yes. Whoa. Was He shot bars, your nine year old kid? And he killed a wild boar. Now they'll text you some pictures. You'll, you'll be savaged. He looks, he got really long hair and he's in the photo with the boys. All this face paint on his face and he's got his little bad ass boat right there. His arrows all passed through y three now. And that's what kind of pose you shooting. He shoots, he shoots 30 pounds right now because he's tiny. Yeah, he's nine. He's nine, but he's small. He's a small nine. That's small. It's a pretty fucking strong for 30 pounds is super strong. Do you have. I'm lifting weights. He's ripped.

Speaker 4:          02:28:33       No, he's dead serious. He's got a six pack. He's never stopped moving. He's got a lot of energies onto those kids. He's uh, he, um, he's at skate camp right now up at Woodward West. So I dropped him off at Woodward West and I got some work to do in southern California here. So he's at skate camp hanging out or you were saying there's something wrong with your back? Yeah. What's going on? Ah, I dunno, that's what I'm doing here. I'm just, I mean, I had to get an Mri this morning. I kinda just tweaked my back like, uh, about nine months ago and it was really bad. Um, I was doing a workout and it hurt it. What part of your back? My lower back. Yeah. I've got a machine in the back. I want to show you what's wrong. We're done here. It's a reverse hyper. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       That's good. Have you heard of them before? Yeah, I use them a little bit. Oh really? Yeah, they're the shit. They're really good if you can, if you have a place for them, you should get a. it's a fucking phenomenal piece of machinery. So I got really into crossfit, so I was using, I was using the reverse hyper a lot. Yeah, that's good. So it, was this before or after the injury? I'm like before and after. Yeah. Yeah. Does it help? Reverse? Hyper helps out. Helps stretch me out and loosen it up. There's also some, we have some decompression stuff in the back, some different spinal decompression and things that I could show you that will help. I'm kind of an expert now in healing up a back injury. I had a pretty severe bulging disc issue for Jitsu that my hand's numb. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:30:00       But now it's gone. It's completely. That's crazy. Yeah. I don't have any bolt at all. Had an MRI. It's clean. I've never had back issues. And uh, like nine months ago I was training the thing with the hat. I think the thing that happened is I was training like really pretty seriously for like got really into it, got really excited about it and just love training and it was like one of those things I just love to do. So I like five days a week I got really like muscular throughout my, my, my hips and my quads and my core and I just got super, super developed, you know, kind of like my muscles got like cables and um, and then I just had like a five month period of time where I was just traveling out of the country for like five months and I just couldn't do the same kind of workout.

Speaker 4:          02:30:43       So I was in. He's really mellow workouts and kind of not working out too much and then I got home and it had like a month to get ready for winter and so like, you know, ease back into the workout thing and the first workout I did my body just got pissed, just locked up a tried to go just a little too hard too quick or trying to go really mellow, but I was going relatively mellow compared to what I was doing before, but my body just was like, I don't know, it just was pissed. Do you ever fuck with yoga? I Love Yoga. I do. I really like it. I just the yoga classes around my house or never the right time and I don't do it by myself. Just get a DVD or youtube man. I need a lot

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       of videos on youtube and you to do that. That's man. That's been a saving grace for me. It's been a big help and like, and also there's a lot of yoga exercises that I didn't even realize they before I did it. They, they act as a spinal decompression. They stretch you out, you feel your back pop, pop, pop as you're. You're doing some of the stretches. I actually really love Yoga. It's fucking awesome, man. I go to yoga classes. My wife's super into yoga. It's one of those things though, like for a dude, especially a manly surfer, bowhunting type dude. Tell people, yeah, I'm really into yoga. Oh, what are you sucking dicks over there and that yoga class, they're starting. It's one of those, it seems like a good thing or a bull. You're a bow hunter and you surf 50 foot waves on paper.

Speaker 3:          02:32:01       You're a pretty fucking macho dude fella. Yeah, but if you. If you talked to anybody who knew me, well, they wouldn't. It would never describe me as macho. Well, I don't mean macho like a in a dumb way to walk into a yoga class is what I'm saying. Of course you don't, but saying it like saying yoga to people. I'm not saying obviously I don't have a problem with it. I do it all the time, but I'm saying there's a sort of preconceived notion about yoga that it's like, it's not a hard thing to do. It's not like a mailing, but it's one of the most difficult things to do that I have ever done that kicks your ass. Fuck. Yeah. Does. Especially hot yoga is. It's unbelievable how difficult it is. My wife does this stuff called Buddhi Yoga. Have you ever heard that? Buddhi Yoga.

Speaker 3:          02:32:39       I like it. I read a yoga, like yoga. She's going to kill me. Yoga slash kind of simulate twerking, but it's like a dance yoga. It's like high energy but like crazy yoga poses, but they like gnarly cardio too. And the girl Jen who teaches the class is bad ass and it's the gnarliest workout. I'd never done it. Okay. Too much for that. For Buddhi Yoga? Yes. Yes. See, I knew it. I knew I couldn't. What is this? This is Buddhi Yoga. Jamie found it already. So this girls throwing like a back kick. Yeah, that's. That's definitely not what I'm talking about. Yeah. Well, I think every. I don't think Buddhi Yoga has an official designation, so I think a lot of people call their stuff Buddhi Yoga, but the class and my wife does it will kick your ass. It's like really high energy. It's really crazy. Cardio and it's yoga too.

Speaker 3:          02:33:26       So. And there's twerking is a little bit. Are they, do they play like little wayne and like the gangster rap and I just, they just go off, you know, they, they get none of that. That's probably more my wife's much hotter than in her booty. Yoga with twerking plus little way music. Anything that keeps, keeps stuff. The Mrs. Oh sure. Shay in shape and nice and tight. I'm a giant fan of them. Yeah, for them all about it. Yeah. If girls want to do this all day, absolutely all about it. I'm a big fan of what she's doing here in this video. I don't see any downside. Anything. I'm agreeing with you. One hundred percent. Well listen man, thank you very much for coming. I really appreciate it. And Shane's got a twitter but he doesn't use it. So uh, she see him say hi. Yeah, I got an instagram that I use. Okay, and what is instagram?
