Speaker 2:          00:02:40       I have a championship belt. I'm, I'm a calm the comedy store fantasy champion. I don't talk about him. Sort of a closet case, but you don't eat that. You don't think it's serious. I have a championship belt Joe who made the belt. Uh, the commissioner of the League. It has the big comedy. It's all gold and black as a goal. If someone spent money on those, yeah, we all threw in an extra or 20

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       bucks and it's like $200 belt. It is awesome. No. Um, if you lose, do you have to give that belt up or do you keep a copy of the belt forever because you were the champ? Unfortunately our league isn't that luxury to where you get to keep a model belt that the Belko sign to the next winter. Yeah, because everybody always wonders that like with boxing matches, like how does that work? Does a guy get the belt? You get a copy, your own Belks guys keep a belt. If you were the champ, you go over like sugar ray Leonard's house. He's still got the belt. He's not the champion anymore. But the belts Dylan his house. Yeah. Hmm. They give you a replica works that way with program. They should give you the real one, the replica that we should be a new one for the new champion. Hey gree.

Speaker 4:          00:09:24       Tony Hinchcliffe a world tour. We've been on young man. Yeah, we've been everywhere. We've traveled the globe. We've extended our reach. We've done sets throughout the lands. We've gone from the high of the rocky mountains all the way to a hockey rink in the middle of Canada. We did so much the past couple months. Yeah, we did a hockey rink and we, me and Bryan County did a goddamn hockey rink in Canada. Like what a stereotype way up there too, man. It's two hours north of Edmonton. Yeah. Yeah. What was the name of that town again? Lloydminster. Lloydminster Nice folks. Great people. Great people. A lot of people talking about how they drove three hours from the north and yeah, it was, that's what happens when you do those middle of nowhere shows you get access to a bunch of people that ordinarily they just can't physically get to you in time.

Speaker 4:          00:10:14       Right. It takes too much time. I talked to this one duty drove 18 hours once to a show. Wow. Yeah. That's a god. A God damn responsibility when you're telling jokes to a guy who drove 18 hours. Yeah. That's, that's uh, I'm glad you told me after the show. Tell me before the show, I'd be like, fuck, I can't even do new shit now. I've gotta give this guy some fuck. I gotta throw some heat. 1818 is a long trip. That's a hell of a trip. But yeah, dude, we, we'd been everywhere man. Those, uh, those gigs up in Canada, number fucking bad ass. We went from one place, which is in the middle of the nowhere, which was a hockey rink to that theater in Vancouver. That was just fucking incredible. Yeah. It was like the perfect contrast. Yeah. Like three or 4,000 seat crazy theater with big fancy chandelier.

Speaker 4:          00:11:01       So it was like game of Thrones. Yeah. And it was right to do it the right way to, we did the hockey rink first and then the Nice theater second. If we did it the other way, it would be depressing. Yeah. Toto was like, oh, it's over. Look at us. We're in a fucking hockey rink now. Yeah. Joan Rivers, just a Oh yeah, that's a rough one. Yeah. So, uh, rest in peace. Joan Rivers, that chick, you know, agree with or not agree with her. I mean, a lot of people were mad at her about her take on Gaza and the whole Israeli thing. She's Jewish and she's old. You know, she was, but uh, she was a real fucking comic. Real comic will ever meet her till the very end. No, I was supposed to do her show, man. I was supposed to do our show where I lie in bed with her, like in bed with Joan. Right. Yeah. Um, that would have been the first time I met her. She has

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       like a podcast that she does from a bed and you know, people climb in bed with her and you tell your jokes.

Speaker 2:          00:12:00       You might still have a chance if you make it over there and then you start of a good excited on the too soon. Joe Can, I always love that. I can't believe you did it. It's my favorite thing. Actually knew her. Her daughter. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:16       Pretty well though. Nope. No, no, no. Never met her. No, no, never met. I might've said hi to her once at a place. Maybe I'm not, never talked to her though. Um, that's um, that's rough stuff man. But you know, 81 years old

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       career, I mean she, you know, she was like Carson's favorite. Yes. Shouldn't have some falling out with Carson. Yeah. Cause she took a gig going up against him from Fox. He was on NBC. She took the 1130. He built her, he was, she was his guest host. And he was really offended when she went against him competing and ratings.

Speaker 1:          00:12:54       Yeah, I dunno man. Uh, I feel like, you know, I feel like that's unfortunate, but the whole paradigm of television, like having to watch things at the same time, like having an eight o'clock show, you know, Mork and Mindy is competing with, you know, Blah Blah Blah. That's on an another time. Whenever you have that, you're going to have these sort of competitive type issues. It's going to be, it's going to be gross. That's the beautiful thing about the Internet. You know, like when it comes to like podcasts and shows, nobody tries to like compete with anybody. Nobody tries to keep like guests from going to other podcasts. No one does any of that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:34       Well, when Joan was competing with Johnny, I'm pretty sure there was just a regular flat screen. I'm pretty sure that was just like three or four channels at the time when those two are competing. So it's definitely a whole new age, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:13:46       Yeah. Yeah. There was nothing man there you had like, you didn't even have Fox back then. You did ABC, CBS and NBC and that's it. Yeah. What a fucking monopoly, Huh? Oh, insane. They had America's mind and ears. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:00       And the in the, in America, if you wanted to find out or be entertained by something else, you had to go find a book or make your own movie.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       Wow. Isn't that amazing? Yeah. When you really think about it, the numbers that they must have had, like during the happy days, like when happy days was a hit, they must've had like 30 40 50 million people watching. Right. Seems like it must be much more than they have today because of the options today are so huge. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       I don't think they can get one person to watch as many as it as much at one time

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       would have. Yeah. It's amazing that you still have network television really. If you really stop and think about it cause cable, they can kind of do so much more. Yeah. Like even if they don't swear, I think about like the shit they got away with on breaking bad. You could never do that on NBC. Right. They would never let you.

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       You can never have like open drug selling and using and murder and all that crazy shit the way they do it. Yeah. Well he tried. I do believe he pitched it to somebody. I can't remember whether it was network or not, but it definitely found its home where it landed. AMC, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Meanwhile, nobody had watched anything on that network before. There was no like one show that everybody tuned into on that network, but some network did turn him down for that. Imagine being those executives like, oh gosh, I wonder if that's true. I wonder if they did turn it down. No, I know. I know for a fact. I can't remember which channel, but somebody turned down breaking bad originally. Vince Gilligan pitched it. I can't remember whether it was network or or Fox or FX or something, but somebody turned that down.

Speaker 4:          00:15:41       Breaking bad. What a dummy. Yeah. OOPS, big. Whoops. I'm watching the show. The strain. Have you seen that? That's the Benicio del Toro not been. He showed delta are where? Mo Del Toro, a production of a, it's a book that he wrote with this Guy Chuck Hogan, some vampire book, but it's super fucking gory. Like really fucking gory. And when I'm watching it like that, like along with walking dead, which is obviously really gory too, you could never have those. I'm like NBC. They would, they would, they would have a shit fit. Right. But you still have NBC, you still have CBS, you still have ABC. There's people that still want to watch those sitcoms. Like they still have a hold on a certain type of show. Like especially like network sitcoms. Like that's their shit. Those like those cameras, sitcoms where they have an audience, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       Well those are the channels now networks, just the channel that like people put on in, leave on and fall asleep and walk around the house with that on. It's not really, like know, there's no real passion behind me. Like NBC. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's um, I don't want, I wonder what they could do because it seems like there's just too many options. If you had to like a regular night. I mean, imagine if you had like ABC before the Internet and you watched this thing come along and then you watch all these cable companies come along and put you on ABC in 1980 and you just, you know, chilling on a fucking yacht out there in the middle of the Pacific smoking cigars saying, we've got an made. This fucking business is locked down, and then all of sudden this creepy thing called cable comes around this table, but things were never going to take off.

Speaker 4:          00:17:20       They can swear. What can they swear? That's the thing called the FCC, right? Yeah. That's what people don't know. They could do whatever they want on cable. That's why comedy central has uncensored content late at night. If you tune in to comedy central late at night, you'll hear all sorts of terrible language. They can do that shit. And if by terrible you mean awesome. I mean terrible. If you're a fucking square. Yeah. There's a lot of those out there that aren't there. That's the other thing with the networks and the sitcoms, a laugh track. Nothing drives me crazier than hearing. Even if it's a live studio audience, it's just, I don't want to hear people laugh. Don't tell me when the laugh, I don't want to name the big bang without the laugh track. No. Yeah, there's videos on the big bang without the laugh track and it's fucking confusing.

Speaker 4:          00:18:09       Well this makes more sense. At least you know when you listen to people not laughing, you go, okay, well that's much more likely. Right? But it also could be in their defense, it could be like second and third takes like the second and third take. Like audiences don't fucking laugh. I mean they laugh a little like ah, but sometimes you have to do a line like four or five times to get it right. Or there might be a camera issue or there might be a sound issue and they have to repeat a scene. So when you're doing a sitcom in front of a live audience, there's oftentimes many takes, like we used to fucking beat the audiences up. Oh, it was awful. The poor people, they would sit there and in the crowd during the news radio days and if something wasn't working like they had to do it a couple of times.

Speaker 4:          00:18:53       Like there was times when an episode didn't go well where it got like three, four takes in a row. But when we would get like first take or second take, like we always do a second take but we do first taking second take and they're like we got it. I'd be like, oh my God. Cause was third takes are brutal cause he knew that you were wearing on people's patients. Like the audience had to sit there and like, oh my God, okay we're going to do it again folks. And you hear the audience go, Oh oh no. But in this video it's more just horrible writing and horrible jokes. It's pretty bad. But you want to play it. Yeah, I think we'll get pulled off of youtube, but I think that's the theme lately. Hot again, the big bang. These people all just got 1 million bucks in episode.

Speaker 4:          00:19:36       Good for them. Good for them. I have no, no problem with that. I think it's amazing, but the show sucks. It's fucking terrible. They can't help but suck. They're trying to suck. They're trying to Anne and I don't mean suck for some people. See that's the thing about suck with sucks for you is what other people are looking for. And that's not hard for people to recognize. Like everyone wants everyone else to have their own sensibilities. When I say that something sucks, someone else might come along and say, that's my favorite shit. Like when I was bear hunting up in Alaska, I had a hangup or up in Canada, I had to hang out with all these people that love country music and they've watched the country music channel, the rivets, the best folks ever, the nicest people ever. And um, they, they play this fucking country music shit all day. And some of it is just mind numbing. Just it's so, it's just so dumb and it's, it's not just dumb. It's like they're appealing to like the dumbest part of your brain, like the part of your brain that wants everything to be a Norman Rockwell painting the part of your brain that doesn't want subtlety or nuance thinking or it's the introduced at all the concept that you're actually on a fucking

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       planet flying through the universe. All those concepts are like, there's none of that, you know? Yeah. And we'll, when we were young and wild and we got married and had a child and all good. Jesus is with us all the time. Fuck you. I just got a text. They want to make you the newest country. Sorry. I can do it. I can do it. Hey brought away. How good was fucking dumb. My rares music yesterday. Oh, that was amazing. Dom Irrera has good fucking music. Yeah. Dom still in music. Dom, I rare raw, wrote a good fucking song and I'm not bullshitting. I'm going to get them to email me that shit. Yeah. Here's that. Really get them to email it to me while a cause. I don't think he has an online. We go,

Speaker 6:          00:21:35       oh, this is the big bang. Nothing makes beer tastes better then cool. Rocky mountain spring water. Well, the rocky mountains anywhere. Philadelphia. Really? I thought they were out west some place. Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie rocky take place

Speaker 7:          00:21:57       for the Gulf? Yeah. Okay, now I get it.

Speaker 6:          00:22:02       Oh, this is the plan. From now on. We're just going to hide out in here to avoid the shaming. I am very comfortable here. Penny. Joe, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way. I have one yourself. Somebody who's been ticking bitchy pill.

Speaker 7:          00:22:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       this is bad for America. Stop this right here. This is bad for America. That's not just bad. That's bad for the world. That's bad for the country. That's bad. That's bad for him.

Speaker 8:          00:22:30       Right, and that's all riding in somebody. Each thinking. That's funny, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       That got through every script supervisor and meeting and pitch. I lighters the best of the best. That's all the desks, ideas,

Speaker 8:          00:22:45       nothing on NBC and all these guys want to really survive. They're going to have to have like an NBC cable or an app where NBC can make programming that's more adult like they do on cable or that NBC is just going to become an APP. When that does happen, and it's not like cable and network's not going to mean the same.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       See, I think you're saying that, but I think the people that listened to some of that dopey ass country music, those people don't have an issue with it. There's, there's certain people that will tell you, big bangs, my favorite show. Yeah, that's a good show.

Speaker 8:          00:23:16       Jordy isn't like that. That's not right. That's why breaking bags or HBO or showtime is getting better ratings than anyone

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       did. Not. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. The numbers that watch breaking bad or not nearly the numbers that watched the big bang, it's not even close. Really? Yeah. It's not even in the ballpark. It's true. They only had like that, dude. You gotta know what you're talking about. That's not true. It is getting, they're getting great. They do well because they're awesome. They're and people find them, but they're on table. It's way more difficult to get someone to watch a show say on AMC or a show on, you know, any one of those. The history channel, it's, it's very difficult. That's why when the duck dynasty show got insane ratings, they got like some crazy number, like 9 million or 7 million people to watch. It was the highest rated cable show ever. That's not even close to what those big bang kids get that that's like an 18 million people a week show

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       they went in every week. Sometimes the second number two of the week is a rerun of that first show that they're number one on. Sometimes a big bang rerun can beat everything on TV.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       What's going on is that they're trying to trick dumb people and the thing, and they're smart, but watch it and nerdy show they've made a nerdy show for dumb people. Like they've hijacked to markets. Yeah. They've hijacked the people that want to be smart and you know, and the wanting to be nerds and then they've also got the dumb people. They've got both markets. It's really a lot of dumb people. Mostly dumpy. Yeah. Yeah. Break that breaks more ratings. Records. Yeah, but this is a guarantee. That's an old article because breaking bad canceled and the duck dynasty things post that and the duck dynasty thing got the highest ratings ever is 2013 but yeah, I mean the numbers, but what's the numbers

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       pulled a 6.6 million, right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       That's a fail for. If that was, if that was happening with the big bang, they would be terrified. Yeah. It's crazy what they brought and trust me, I know what I'm talking about, not just making this up. I'm just saying that the, the cable channels aren't getting great ratings occasionally for for shows like breaking bad. They do much better than they used to do, but they're still, they pale in comparison to the major network shows. For whatever reason, those really dumb shows still get the best ratings. Like, yeah, like game of Thrones is a different example because it's a subscription channel and it's got far less people tune into it like he used to be. If you got an HBO special, that was the shit. All my God, you know, we saw that Sam Kinison, Hbo Special, the Chris Rock, HBO special, but now a comedy central special is way better than an HBO special cause a comedy central special is going to be seen by way more people, millions more people and then on top of that they're going to replay the shit out of it because they, that's all they play is comedy and people go there for comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       But like the numbers, like if you look at the numbers like you would think that like the soprano's like well it must have been an unbelievably high rated show. It was for HBO but not compared to like the big bang or compared to friends, right. Friends was on top or be all that stuff. It's just amazing that those things are still, that's, those things are still viable and I wonder what events always going to be the case if there's always going to be people who like bland, like really easy to swallow humor like sitcommy

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       humor.

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       I think that generation is going to die out. I really do. I know it's just like a fading thing and even that thing about like the network App, I think the people that were re that really, really, really are into that type of stuff though it's going to be 10 more years before they even know what an APP is. Apple TV I think has going and those kind of network TVs I think are going to really change the thing. Everything like the iPhone, if they make it so that some they, they can't get directly to one of those three channels. If they show them other ways, then yeah, but these people that watch network TV or probably just always watch network TV, they're used to a laugh track. They need that. Yeah, I think so too. I remember a part of Man on the moon where it's a Andy Kaufman played by Jim Carrey talking to his manager, George Shapiro, played by Danny Devito and he and Danny Devito is his manager and he goes, I got you the best Gig, Andy, you're going to love it, and this is in the 70s or whatever. And Andy's like, great, what is it? He goes, sit-com taxi. It's going to be huge. You're going to love it. And he goes a sitcom with a laugh track. All those dead people laughing, you know, those are dead people. That's the worst stuff. That stuff's not funny and it's amazing to me. You know that he was saying that at the end of the seventies and it's still, it's 2014 and people are still watching stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:04       It's funny that you say it because I was watching this. I'm a hunter s Thompson documentary the other night. I just put it on while I was cleaning my office. And um, it's, it's from the BBC. The BBC did a, um, uh, a piece on him and um, oh, I'll tell you what it is right here. Oh, actually I don't have it on this. Um, anyway, it was, it was very pocalypse pick like his take on society and America where America is headed. And this is in the early seventies. They did this thing, maybe the late seventies at the, at the very latest wasn't the 80s though. You know, you're, you're watching this guy who's now committed suicide. He's dead brilliant writer. Who's seeing the shift from the 60s to the 70s and he's saying that America is just going downhill. We become this fascist, ridiculous state and our, our, our culture is eroding and that, you know, within, you know, 10, 20 years it's going to be over for us.

Speaker 4:          00:29:06       And now here we are, 2014, you know, 30 plus years later and everybody's still kind of saying the same shit. You know, everybody's still kind of saying, you know, hey, it's all, it's all falling apart. Hey Arc, I'll culturals disastrous. It's, it's doom and gloom always. I think that what's going on is that there's always going to be a certain amount. What does this fear and loathing and on the road to Hollywood's at the BBC documentary. Yeah. Okay. Um, I think there's always going to be a certain amount of, uh, of people that think that the world is ending. Sky's falling, and there's going to be a certain of bullshit

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       that goes on always. There's always going to be people trying to correct for all the evils of the world, whether it's war or crime or this or that. There's always going to be that and then there's always going to be like an adjustment period where you know you have like a bunch of police brutality cases and then someone figures out a way to a stop the police from behaving that way and then you know, things get better or is it going to be like horrible war and then people protest the horrible war and then it gets better. It's just, it seems like these ideas that it's all gonna fall apart and society is going to collapse. Like I think all that shit happened, the society collapsing back when people didn't understand the society could collapse and now we have so much detailed history on like what it takes for a society to become like Rome when Rome fell, what it takes for a society to become, you know, like one of these archetypal societies that people talk about when the, you know, the ancient Greeks or the Romans or any of these. When you talk about like a society that was on top of everything had all of these scholars and all these intelligent people and then collapsed.

Speaker 2:          00:30:47       Yeah. It's going to be interesting to see what the next big one like that is because it's going to have technology and robots and a whole bunch of crazy stuff like way down the road, but there's going to be some crazy stuff

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       you saw him far away. Yeah. I think the technology, robots, all that shit like we're where things are going to be so much weirder than the art. Today's going to happen so fast. You know? If you listen to like Ray Kurzweil and these futurists guys, their take on it is always so enlightening because everybody wants to think of it as like, you know, when we were kids we had VCRs and now we have Netflix. What a jump, what a leap. But the leap really has been within the past few years, the past few years has been bigger leaps and they were from the VCR to the Internet. Like did the delete you getting crazier? There's a fucking app that they came out with for Google face or Google a Google glasses that recognizes your moods. Whoa. Yeah. What it recognizes your fucking mood. Like, if I come up to you with this, Google, Google, I can't even say Google glass.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       I'm just gonna call it Google glass. If I come up to you with this app installed and wearing Google glasses, it tells me if you're happy. It tells me if you're angry, let's, it analyzes your face. Interesting. That's creepy as shit man. Pull that up. Pull it up. Lot of cameras have something like that already built in with the smile detection. Like where are you pointing a camera and it will take a picture when it detects that you're smiling. Oh, okay. But that's not breeding like mood. It's just detecting a certain movement of your face. This fucking stupid thing is actually trying to like look at someone's face and decide, you know that gross thing that really cheesy dude's due to chicks or they go, hey, it doesn't hurt to smile. You know it actually a more muscles are involved in frowning here and smiling. It takes more energy to frown. Does a smile,

Speaker 9:          00:32:40       hey, you know why not smile? You know that thing, that gross thing, that dude's due to checks. Have you ever seen a guy do that makes you fucking embarrassed to be a man? Yeah. That's going to be way more commonplace. People are going to be doing that all the time. My Google glass is, recognizes you're not in the best mood right now. He, uh, my Google glass, it says you're depressed. Do you need a hug? Cause I'm here. You know, just take a chance. I'm a good guy. Did, uh, did, uh, you were wearing Google glasses or are you just happy to see me? It's totally wrong. You got it the wrong way. What is this? A video that Google glass on Google glass did take the information behind. See this for the first time. We'll give the zooming up. Don't frown. Hoofers proprietary shore software library. Let's have a look at how it works.

Speaker 9:          00:33:40       Sure. Process is high resolution video in real time on the glass CPU. Does it only work on nerdy checks, emotions or do detection? Oh my God. In addition to that, it does age and gender recognition and age estimation and gender recognition. What if you're a like a really good looking older transsexual man, you think it'll get you at the time of this Beta. This has only worked on white people. That is a beautiful old man. Sure is not limited to a single phase, uh, angry hipster or respect other people's privacy. There is no recognition of milestones and none of the images leaves the device. Fuck you. It doesn't, but that's not all our short technology can do. Even more helpful things not shown in this demonstration.

Speaker 9:          00:34:40       Valance recognition for very subtle reactions. Whoa. Head pose estimation. I blinked detection. This was just a demo. Okay. This one corner is not available in an APP store. This looks like a pirate and his hostage. It's not available in an APP store. What does that mean? It's now maybe now available. Not Ready yet. Not Ready. Oh, it might be bullshit. And that might've been just like a, like we might've gotten fucking pranked. You know, it says it's not available to an APP store cause it seems so fake. If I saw that years ago, I would say that's total bullshit because that technology was so good. Alien I the idea of it. But now after the Google glass thing, you might not be able to tell by the smile on my face, but I'd be really disappointed if that's not real. That's the thing is like it can't really, it's just seeing if your mouth moves side to side and like it's frowning,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       but some people, you know, some people cry happy tears and some people smile when they're furious. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He's super happy joking with this guy. You're looking at Ted Bundys car, nice car that's been barred. It's full. A happy good cheekbones guys smiling. Got a clown mask door. Doesn't have an inside handle. Yeah. Oh he's got a knife in his tank. I'm sure that's for cutting birthday cake. He's a happy guy. Duct tape.

Speaker 1:          00:36:12       Weird. But one day they're going to get really good at it to the point where there will be able to detect. It's going to really be able to show you gonna be able to detect, not just that you're going to be able to detect people's thoughts, like it's going to start out with moods, but eventually you're going to be able to see like graphic representations and what a person's thinking. You'll be able to tune that. They'll be able to figure out. I think the way they're going to have to do it is, I've been thinking about this a lot. You know how, um, there was no cameras and then they became cameras. Like when we were young, there was no way that you could ever imagine that someone was going to carry around a camera all the time like that. You wouldn't think of that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:49       You saw a camera, it was around someone's waist or someone's neck router and they'd have to hold it up and take that picture. It wasn't just simply like this little phone thing that were going on. Now that's a big leap. The, the big leap of having cameras in your pocket at all times. Um, and if you went back before the invention of the camera, if you went way, way back to like, you know, back in the days when there was just paintings and drawings and things along those lines, they could have never imagined that you'd be able to make video from a little tiny slender device that you stick in your pocket. You read the devil if you showed them that and now this phone that you can take video with and go online with and take photographs now it's become a part of you. It's become a part of who you are.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       It's like it's a symbiotic thing. You keep it with you. You'd never leave the house without it. When you do you freak out. I think they're going to come up with something that stores your memory better than you do. Are they going to say we have in, it'll probably be like an addition, like an upgrade to the human memory banks. I come here, we have, yeah, like a memory card. But that did shows you crystal clear video of what you saw. So like, you know how if you had to pull like yesterday out of your memory banks, he'd be like, ah, fuck, what did I do? What did I do? What did I do? Okay, I got up, I, this is what I had for breakfast. But it's all blurry as fuck. Right, right. They're going to be able to get it so that it's exact, well, you'll be able to rewind and play it back

Speaker 3:          00:38:23       Google glasses, what did I do yesterday at 1245 right.

Speaker 1:          00:38:28       And then you're gonna be able to share that with other people. Yeah. You're going to be able to share your day.

Speaker 3:          00:38:33       What I'm wondering is, is if it'll ever to the point to where

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       we're paying for our privacy. You know, like once everything's all wired in and you had the, you know, once your Google glasses or in a cloud with what you looked up on the Internet that day and you're walking by somebody with Google glasses and you know what I mean? Like they walk by and it's like, you know a bubble pops up over their head and you know this guy was looking at, you know yeah double anal clown porn earlier. It's like whoa that's stranger was looking at clown porn. That's crazy. But like if they paid $10 a month or something that other people wouldn't be able to know what they know. Like I'm wondering how fast and how far it's really going to go. Cause I think about it a lot too. Cause I love pot and I think there's something about pot that makes you love thinking about the future. Especially technology cause I mean it's all happening. It's so weird and privacy and phone calls and things backed up can know everything. You can find out everything about somebody, their daily habits every time.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Gina's thing about the cell phone towers that they don't believe or really cell phone towers, their cell phone, their cell phone towers that they've located that don't seem to be transmitting cell phone data and they've gone to them with like these, these devices that try to read and what they think is going on is the cell phone towers are actually tapping into phone calls and recording your information. Like say if the police want to find out where Tony Hinchcliffe is right now and you know you could use the gps on the phone and find out that he's on the four oh five and he's headed to San Diego and you know, and then they go, okay, we're going to tap into his phone so they can tune in through that tower and listened to your phone calls. You're like, I got the fucking heroin. The dude's off duct taped in the trunk. I've got 15 different handguns that are all illegal. Everyone's laughing on the other end. We, you, the cops are listening to the entire conversation. Like they can do that. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:40:27       There was a terror I that just went up in my backyard the other day, like out of nowhere, there was no construction out of nowhere.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Tia. Yeah, black helicopters. They've been doing this Brian for a long time. That was

Speaker 8:          00:40:39       fun getting to meet him and it has two antennas on the top like that looked like wifi antennas. You can't see him in this picture. But then there's a solar panel and we have our uh, overhead lines, power lines in our neighborhood. So there's like, you know, they're above ground and there's no power going to it. So that means this is whatever this is is just running on a solar and it has antennas and like a weird box on the side of it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:02       It's probably nothing. Yeah, probably like what you mean you're freaking out about it. Why don't you just find out what it is? Yeah, I bet it has a number on it. You can call or something. No, it doesn't. For reading problems. Go here. Did you try to research what it is now? I mean, why don't you take a photo of it and put it up on Twitter? Take that picture and what they say. What did people say?

Speaker 8:          00:41:21       People are pointing towards this, that article. That's the only thing that people have been saying.

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       Yeah, but see, people do that when they, you know, if you don't really know what the fuck it is. I might be that though. Yeah. Who? I didn't, I'm not even

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       saying it to that. I'm just saying it was really odd because one day it was there, one day will, it wasn't and it was just like in my neighbor's backyard. I wonder if they can do that. Can you take a cell phone tower and attach it to an electrical pole or does it have to have it's own stand alone sort of thing? I would think that, I don't know anything about it, but I would think that the s the electricity would maybe fuck with it all that, all that power going through those lines. If they don't let us turn on, if they make us turn off our cell phones when the plane's about to take off, I don't think they could put a cell phone tower on it. Yeah, but that's a, that's a stupid thing. That whole turn off your electronic devices. That's all been disproven now.

Speaker 4:          00:42:13       So that's why everybody's allowed to use like iPods and shit and iPads right up until the time you land. But you're still not allowed to use Bluetooth. Like if you have those Bluetooth headsets, like there was a dude in front of me on the airplane the other day. He had the Bluetooth headset and a, they told him he couldn't have it on. You couldn't have it on while the plane because it could interfere with communications. Yeah, but that's probably bullshit too. So they probably just don't know any better and they just say it because they just want to tell you to shut something off and they can't do that anymore. I think it's awesome for planning things. So you can't have like a Bluetooth headpiece and you're sitting in the front row and I'm in the back row and we're all kind of communicating like, hey, you know, like terrorist stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:42:52       Awesome. Do they work like that? I don't know. That seems like that wouldn't you if you had to communicate with somebody else in the plane? Yeah, but a Bluetooth headset, as far as I'm aware, all it does is communicate with an actual device. Like a phone. You'd have to be talking on the phone to someone in the back of the plane. Yeah. I don't think you can communicate through Bluetooth, can you? Yeah. I mean you can connect Bluetooth, that Bluetooth and stuff like that, but can you connect Bluetooth too? Bluetooth and talk like if you had, I don't think so, man. I think you need some sort of a transmission device. I think like if you had a Bluetooth head set on it and I had a Bluetooth headset on, we couldn't just connect our headsets and communicate with each other. We would have to do it through a device. Right. I don't know how that Bluetooth, Jamie, I've never had one. I'm no, no either. Well, even if you couldn't, you'd probably will be able to write and within a year or so they'll figure it out. It's all happening so God damn fast. Oh yeah. There's, it looks like, yeah, there's Bluetooth headset, walkie talkies on Amazon. Oh, it's a walkie talkie. And it's like just in a little earpiece in your ear. That's it. That's the whole device. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          00:43:59       Whoa. That's what, that's scary. Check this out. Uh Oh shit. I gotta get your video up. Uh, like a heavy small wireless and visible earpiece. G A Bluetooth earpiece. Wow. That looks like an actual tooth. Well that's when someone can talk to you through a walkie talkie though. I use those when I was on fear factor, they've had those forever. They used to use radios and now now they use Bluetooth. But all that is, is allowing you to talk. You have to have a walkie talkie on you, on you. And it connects to the walkie talkie. Mine used to connect with a radio frequency. I'd

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       wear like a backpack, like a battery pack rather. The slow communication pack and it would work that way. But someone else on the other end had to have a communication device. They had a walkie talkie and they were talking through that and it would go to directly to me and I couldn't talk to them except for the fact that I was hardwired with a microphone that also had a radio frequency that went to a box. And the box, there was a guy, there was a sound guy that was there and it would go through them and through their, uh, through their speakers. But it was like the entire cast was wired up, so all, and you could turn each microphone on or off, but that requires a lot of equipment. You know, you've got a lot of different shit going on there. What I'm saying is if someone has a Bluetooth headset on just a Bluetooth headset, if they don't have a phone that's on, you're not talking to somebody and you can't really talk to somebody on a phone when you're on an airplane.

Speaker 4:          00:45:23       Here's a, here's the one. It looks like you can do it. It's a, it looks like a walkie talkie thing and it says that it has a two way walkie talkie. Whoa. For 84,000 feet. Whoa. Oh, so they're basically saying that's what it does. Yeah. Who makes that one tooth call? pod.com onyx looks like call pod. The onyx is the name of that. I'm just saying that, but that is a walkie talkie. Yeah. That might be something that it already does exist. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. It's insane because Bluetooth already makes people look crazy. What? Yeah, would they have radios? Yeah. Yeah. These are walkie talkies. What we're saying is that this little thing that that person had in their ear, that that itself is a walkie talkie. That's fucking nuts. That's that little one to how far that transmits though, because Bluetooth, the Bluetooth, you can't really communicate very far.

Speaker 4:          00:46:15       Eight 84,000 feet. That's in the air. They're saying, does that mean distance? No, they don't mean in the air. Planes don't get that high. That's space. That's like three times what a plane goes as the square feet square feet 84,000 oh, so, okay, so it transmits 84,000 feet. 30,000 feet is a flight, so 84,000 feet is like more than a mile. How many thousand feet is a mile? Five thousand five thousand feet in a mile, right. Damn. That's pretty insane. So you could be like essentially down at Jerry's Deli having a meal and I can talk to you in real time through these goofy ass. We should buy these. That's so crazy. What is the company name again? Call pod. Uh, that's where I think that's I, that's where it's sold. It's Onyx. O. N Y. X. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:47:08       N y. X. Hmm.

Speaker 4:          00:47:14       So it's like walkie talkies, except you keep one in your ear, but how does it pick up what you're saying? You just can roam up to 164 feet away. That's not that far. When what happened? I thought we was miles from your smartphone. That's for, so it has to have a smart phone. No, no.

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       That's just phrase it as, that's just for smartphones. If you want to use it as a headset for your smart phone. Yeah. This is what it says with our proprietary two way walkie talkie functionality. You can also connect the onyx to any other call Pod, Bluetooth headset and communicate up to 84,000 square feet while you were still connected to your mobile phone. Oh, you have to be connected to your mobile phone. Hmm. I don't know. I'm not sure. You can use Bluetooth. Yeah, I'm not sure what this is saying that you can connect to any other call Pod, Bluetooth headset and communicate up to 84,000 square feet while you are still connected to your mobile phone.

Speaker 8:          00:48:10       It's just saying that you could still use it and do the walkie talkie at the same time. Like if you're still connected to your phone, you could still use it as the walk.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       Right? Like you don't have to disconnect. We, yeah, we got to find out if this really works. All right. We're going to have to buy, these pitchers will buy them and we'll, we'll broadcast like you. Can we do that? I wonder if we could get it so that we could put the earpiece up to the microphone and you could go out in the parking lot and talk to us. Oh yeah. Put it like right up there and see if it works. Yeah, absolutely. Over you have to say over though.

Speaker 8:          00:48:44       Red Band over we got, we got smoking in the Bush over,

Speaker 1:          00:48:51       but it was all excited because they have those fucking those stupid walkie talkie phones. Those are the dumbest ever it goes to next tell those. But everybody wanted them. They wanted to be like fucking walkie talkie guy.

Speaker 8:          00:49:02       When we were in high school, we didn't have cell phones in our phones, so we all had a CB radios in our car and we all had the humongous antennas on the topic of car. Oh yeah. But it was cool because we all live within a couple miles of each other so we can just like use it as a cell phone before there were cell phones and just to be driving around in our car being like, where are you at? Where you want to go? Smoke some weed at the church. Sure. You know? Wow. You're probably all on police frequencies. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah. We got the, I think two kids are about to go smoke weed at a church. Yup. Yeah. How about those police scanners? You ever go over someone's house and they got a police scanner going on all the time? I got one on my phone. I listen to it all the time. Yeah. But I mean like those real ones that people have in their home. Right. Those are weird. Just the domestic violence network. We have another beating. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:52       Which just something weird about people that want to constantly be in tune with all the crime that's going on around them. Yeah. It's probably guys that like wanting to be in the police force but couldn't pass the examinations. Oh Man. What's that fire truck going by far?

Speaker 8:          00:50:04       The figures, they know all these assholes in my neighborhood are up to no good. I just saw an ambulance and I need to know what's going on now. I do it sometimes like lists. I think it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       Yeah. I mean, I guess so. Yeah. I mean look, voyeurism like and you know, being able to rubberneck right. Uh, crimes and stuff. One of the things they're saying is they're going to try to, in La they're going to try to raise up the walls in between the two lanes, the north and the southbound lanes. She people rubber neck so much and it causes so much traffic. Oh, it's insane. Yeah. It's, it's really frustrating when you get somewhere and you realize that the only reason why everyone drove slows cause some shit went on the other side of the fucking highway, like you fucking self

Speaker 8:          00:50:50       for Chicago in the middle of the highway then it should not slow us down. But everybody wants to see everybody should just get CB radios and keep driving at 75 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:51:01       Yeah. I don't think that's going to help. I know the only thing that's gonna help ally as if it was like multiple layers. Like we would need like several layers of highways. Like you could drive up to the upper highway if you really weren't scared of earthquakes. Yeah. Or if you wanted to be on the top. So if the earthquake happened, you ride that bitch down at the bottom and crush everybody below you.

Speaker 8:          00:51:22       Yeah. You know in Silicon Valley where that one dude had a really skinny car, wears like a one person car. He almost looked like a set piece of sand. Like a bread. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I saw it. Yeah. It's like a, imagine if a car like a mini Cooper was cut in half and make it himself now. It was just kind of a joke. Like that guy is so rich and look at his car, how skinny it is. He's like, he's like poverty bud. Want to listen to your idea? I'm Outta here. And he gets in this tiny, cause it's silicone valley and it's all just you talking about the TV show. Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ. Sorry. Yeah. But yeah, but what if we all had just one person cars in the future? Whereas cars, motorcycles get to go in between cars. So what if we just had to like really skinny cars? Yeah. That's a death trap.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       Yeah. That's not good. That doesn't even a lot of room for error if somebody hits you. Yeah. That's the thing that everybody's looking at. Like, like when when you see a Volvo guaranteed there's a pussy in that car. Someone in there. I was like terrified of crashes. That's just, that's just how it is with Volvos.

Speaker 8:          00:52:18       Got a six star safety rating and I just can't get hit out here.

Speaker 1:          00:52:22       Well Joey Diaz drives a Volvo did the best fucking car you've ever going to have like the Volvo too. So there it goes. My theory, my theory sucks, but so many of those people that do drive those things, so like super safety conscious because of, that's one of the things that all their commercials were geared to. Yeah. This is a boring ass car. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Not Fast, but look what happens when you throw it off a cliff. Boom. Nothing like they build those things to like withstand nuclear blasts. Like you know, if you got one of those, you're not going to eat that shit in for a fucking motorcycle.

Speaker 8:          00:52:56       Super Safe. They only go 45 miles an hour. But it's so sad.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       Well they go normal speeds now. They're pretty fast cars. I mean there's not much difference when you get to like the high end cars. I mean there's, there's a difference as far as like one of them handles more comfortably but they're modern cars are so god damn good. There's so much better. Like that car that we had in Denver that a Hellcat, that's a 707 horsepower American car, ridiculous car. That was unheard 20

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       years ago. I did literally, I literally grew chest hair while sitting in that thing. Like some people use that as a figure of speech. Like, oh put hair on my chest. Like I looked at in the hotel room when I was showering after that and I had more chest hair. It's three times the car I've ever been in

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       that sound. But the point is like that didn't exist. It wasn't even possible. Like when you've got a really fast car from 1970 and I had like 400 horsepower and it was just a death trap. Terrible breaks. No handling. It was like a, an elephant on roller skates. I mean that's what it was like just about every way you was plowing into shit. Barely able to stop. The cars today are just infinitely better. So if you took a Volvo of today, which you consider like a super safe car, very boring, and took it around a race track with like a 1970 challenger, it would bury that car and we just fucking run circles around it and breaking, handling everything. And he'd be like, Whoa Volvos, the greatest fucking hot rod ever. No it's just old cars sucked a fat one old cars, you just, they're just clunky ass shitty technology.

Speaker 3:          00:54:32       That Hellcat challenger. It's 700 horsepower, 700 that means that like the equivalent of that back in the day would be a carriage being pulled by 700 horses and just the one guy in this care in the pack it says hello. But not even that because if you did have a carriage pulled by 700 horses and right next to it you had a challenge or the challenge of the fucking blow by that cause it would

Speaker 1:          00:54:57       gone. It wouldn't even be close. It, I mean, wouldn't let the race would last as much time as it takes for the challenge to drive past the horses. That's it. Once it got to the 700 horse, it's gone. Yeah. I Dunno. Understand horsepower cause some horses are bigger too. Yeah. Some horses. Anything to do with horses really. I think originally, well let's find out. Like I'd imagine a horse is one horsepower, right? Yeah. But like some horses win the Kentucky Derby and other ones fall in or fat stupid faces.

Speaker 3:          00:55:29       Surprised they don't have that for other things. Like how a bicycle, how many cat power is that?

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       Well, I was thinking, man, that's the other place that we got to do a podcast. We got to do a podcast from the Kentucky Derby in, in reference to a hunters Thompson is one of his greatest books that awards greatest pieces was the Kentucky Derby is decadent and depraved. It's fucking great. Great piece. Where it's like you went to the Kentucky Derby and then, you know, like was essentially there were mocking all the people that were there. You know, he was, uh, categorizing all the monsters that were there, but the, by the end of the piece, he realized he was one of them. You know, they're all fucked up and they're at the Kentucky Derby. They realize like, we're no better than any of these savages that are here. Measurements of power, horsepower. It's a unit of measurement of power. The rate of which work is done.

Speaker 1:          00:56:18       The most common conversion factor, especially for electrical power is one equals 746 watts. The term was adopted in the late 18th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses. Huh. It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines as well as turbines, electric motors and other machinery. The definition of the unit varied between geographical regions. Hmm. That's interesting. Most countries now use the s I unit watt for the measurement of power with the implementation of the EU directive. Bubba Bubba, blah, blah, blah. Huh. That's interesting. In the, in the EU, the European Union, uh, the use of horsepower is only permitted as a supplementary unit. Like when you look at cars, um, you know, like if you look at an American car for 700 horsepower, well 700 horses under the truck or under the, under the hood. If you look at European cars, like on European a websites, they have it listed as like, like watts and kilowatts of power. It's really kind of weird like a Land Rover, here's perfect one because it's an English company.

Speaker 7:          00:57:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:37       If you go to their, uh, their, uh,

Speaker 7:          00:57:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       They're a website and you read what they have. It's a, it's really kind of interesting. Like you, you try to make sense of like what is a watt, how much is in that, you know, like what does like a land rover defenders like their version of like a jeep, like dimensions and capabilities, engine and performance here. Yeah. Engine speed. At maximum torque. They have torque Newton meters. Like it doesn't say horsepower. The power and kilowatts, kilowatts kw slash p s I thought kilowatts was just a back to the future thing. I know that's chicken box that senescence Vanessa say it didn't Land Rover defender, which is like their version of the jeep has a 90 kilowatt one 22 p s uh, power rating. So that's how they do in England.

Speaker 7:          00:58:35       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:58:36       They hate America. Yeah. That's what's going on. She didn't know horsepower sounds better. You Silly Brits. Yeah, because whenever you like read about a Ferrari or a Porsche, it's always in horsepower, right? Silly Fox. Yeah, the European Union. What, what we go by the watt system. But it is a smarter way to do it. Really kilowatts. Colas. It is. Why do you think we do it that way too? I mean it makes sense. What the fuck is a horse doing? Being measuring cards. So American, it's so good. How many power or horses is, yeah, we're going to be as fuck. We really are. We're so goofy with inches too. Like when I was a kid, they legitimately tried to introduce the metric system to schools and I remember pm people being like, fuck off, throwing their rollers at the teacher. They were just not buy it. Man. That was in my lifetime.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       I saw it, they were trying to introduce the metric system just like they were trying to introduce soccer. I was like very similar. It was like, and people were like, Nah, no, not having it. The metric system though is so much better. It's everything is intense. It makes sense when we do fights and other countries in England, England is the weirdest cause they still go by stone. Do you know what a stone is? What? Yeah. If you were being measured to be stands 11 stone. Yeah. How much is astounding? I Dunno. Why would they do stones and not horsepower? I mean horses are pretty much are a lot closer than Stellan. Sometimes there's a huge stone. I think a stone is like 14 pounds or 13 pounds. Dude, I'm only like six stones.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       Okay. In many north western European countries, the stone was formerly used for trade with a value ranging from about five to 40 local pounds. With the advent of metrication from the mid 19th century on, it was superseded by the kilogram and remained in limited use for trade in the United Kingdom and in Ireland until prohibited by the weights. And measures act of 1985 but okay. Yeah, it's 14 pounds. But they still use it for like weighing in fighters when fighters way in this Bruce Beth say that? Yes. Oh yeah. Well he doesn't say it. He doesn't really say it. I actually say it. The guy says it to me, the guy, I'll say it to me, you know 14 stone, but when Bruce Buffer. Oh, okay. That's right. That's string way. Bruce buffer does say it though. When they not sure if he still does, if there's an actual, um, during the actual like fight announcement, but at the way in, I would have to say it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:17       Wow. I would have to say like one stone, 10 pounds, you know, one 55, you know, x amount of stones. What does that 10 stone like? Not quite 11 stone. This fucking so strange. 10 stone, nine pounds. And he'd say shit like that. Wow. That is a weird unit. They stopped doing that after a while though. And they had me just read off the weights. Like I don't, I don't read the kilos anymore either. Like if someone says one 55 it's one 55 like it's, this is like, it's too confusing for American fans. 86 kilos shit. Can we get to a computer? You should start guessing. The fighters horsepower announcing that weighing in at six stone and 140 horsepower. You know what's interesting is that it, that's kind of silly, but it's true in fact that the guys with the more horsepower, they run out of gas quicker because it's very relative.

Speaker 1:          01:02:16       Yeah, they like muscle. The plants, how to get there, like there's a certain amount of horsepower you need and then after that it's kind of ridiculous. It's like you're seeing with a race car, like if you have a car and it's a gt car, like if you're going around like a, like a Nurburg ring or something like that, like a real windy course, a lot of handling. You don't necessarily want like a thousand horsepower engine in your car. You want as much engine as your suspension can handle. And when it comes to like miles per hour and miles per gallon, you want like a balance between the two. You want to, we want an engine that produces plenty of horsepower but not so much horsepower that it burns up all your fuel in 30 minutes and you lose the race because everybody keeps going and you're done. You're out of gas. That's true with the body to like, can you see like some dude, he's got this giant fucking massive muscles. The reality is that shit is a, that's like a giant engine and a small gas tank and there's no other way around it. That's how the human body is. There's a balancing act going on so that guy could get you if he get you quick, but if the shit gets dragged into the third, fourth and fifth rounds I got might be toast. He might have a goddamn heart attack in there.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       Do you ever find out what happened to that guy's ribs from Saturday? That Pot's guy up? Is that like 17 punches in the rich? Way More than that. Oh my God. It was [inaudible] 67

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       then unanswered body shots. That's what it was. Yeah. Oh my God. Through all through bolt. Two or three rounds, whatever many rounds it was the fight where it was stopped.

Speaker 2:          01:03:43       He kept covering his head but he left his body open and I remember the guy just kept hitting that same spot. It was crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:03:50       Was very sloppy. Yeah. That was not a good fight. I just, you know, it's unfortunate but true that the larger guys, like a lot of the larger guys like the skill level is just not, does not compare and it's not because like they're not capable of moving. Right. Cause like look at the way a guy like, like a super athlete moves, you know, look at away like peanut pick, pick your favorite basketball player. Lebron James is probably the biggest super athlete in the world. Right. Look at the way that guy moves now. If that guy was an MMA fighter, do you think you would move like those guys? No. He'd move like he is, he has a super athlete. Those guys like especially pots, it's just like, it was real stiff and awkward. It was just shitty technique. That's just not, that's not indicative of what you would expect from a high level athlete. I think that was like the real problem with that fight. It's just the other dude's good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:43       Well the way that it would do you know, the way that it finished was what blew my mind. Yeah. I mean just watching a man, a heavyweight take heavyweight shots to the ribs and especially the same spot. I was noticing when the guy's hand would pick up and he'd wind up, he would hit in that exact same little square diameter that his fist was before and I have all the stuff. I've seen a live, I don't think I've seen anything like that

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       just because the guy did a shit job of defending, but Anthony Hamilton's a good fighter. He's a very good fighter, but it was his first fight. It was his first UFC bout. He moved so much better. Like you could see the he moved like is just the way he is able to physically move back and forth. That's a big thing with heavyweights. Just how much athleticism did they have? I mean how much of it is just sheer size and bulk and horsepower and how much of it is athleticism?

Speaker 3:          01:05:32       Yeah. I've been watching it

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       some pro wrestling. He totally predicted what was going to happen with this. John seen a Brock Lesnar, you knew the thing white out about it. Brock Lesnar, you played it out long at advance perfectly. He knew exactly how it was going to go down. And you're saying that it's sets up something in the future?

Speaker 3:          01:05:53       Oh yeah, absolutely. They offered me a full time writing job. I can talk about it now cause I'm not getting it. I'm not doing it. But a couple months ago they offered me a full time job to move to Stamford, Connecticut. Yeah. After one meeting at a meeting like this, that was about an hour and a half. At the end they go, how would you feel about moving to Stamford Connecticut for one year job with the WWE writing hung the creative side and I go, I'm going to have to think about that. And it didn't pan out because I didn't want to move to Stanford, Connecticut and working nine to five. Even those really good money and everything, but

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       you would have to go to, you drive to a la or drive to New York rather still do spots. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       Which turns out it's just a 45 minute drive, but the job is very grueling than WWE thing. It's not, it's not like our TV comedy writing job. It's like a, I'd have to answer to Vince Mcmahon like Tony. Oh, what'd you do? Get stoned before writing this ideal. Do you think that's what it was? Sorry. Probably. What would you say to him? Well, if you want to say, yeah, I was still, when I wrote all the great ideas that you like, sir. Well, you have a point. I think Vince would try to get you on steroids. Um, he'd probably get me tried to get me to eat

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       beef every chance he gets brought in and price in this from my ranch. I shot this myself this morning.

Speaker 3:          01:07:16       Yeah. Well was it good money? Like serious money. Super serious money. Wow. Sanely serious money. You came close. I was happy to get the offer. I took it as a victory and I love what I do. I love what I'm doing and it might be crazy. I'll never regret it. You know what I mean? I think you regret it right now. I'm looking into your eyes, so no, no. It's kind of a dream job for you. Yeah, sort of. But then again, what I do is sort of a dream job too, and giving up this dream job for that dream job would be crazy. You wouldn't have to give up this dream job. Right. I'm telling you it's a grueling, creepy job. Unfortunately. Trust me, if it was, if, if the word on the streets was man riding for the WWE is the coolest, you can do anything. I would have taken it and I would have lived in New York and it would have been amazing. I would have traveled to Stanford 45 minutes every morning on a subway and Dunnigan Stanford. He, yeah, it would have been amazing and I would have had any, I could've, it was stupid. The amount of money. You don't want to live in Stanford. You know what the problem with Connecticut is? It's not really a state. It is a state, but let's be honest, ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       you, you live in a highway but she in Boston? In New York. Yeah, absolutely. It's like they put some houses on the side of the highway and they call it a town, but that's what's really going on. There's nothing, nothing's being done there and nuns to be made there. What do you got? You got the Glenn Beck show and the WWE. That's your entire state economy. Of course. There's some other things I'm just fucking around. Don't get, don't get all fucking all stanfordy on me. Don't get like all attached and proud of Connecticut, Connecticut pride. We've got a fucking email, Joe Connecticut pride. Connecticut sucks. You know it sucks and I know it sucks. There's some great houses there. Some nice neighborhoods, crazy neighbor. I have my friend Tommy Junior, one of my best friends lives in Connecticut. He tells me it sucks. I trust him. It's not a good spot.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       When I used to drive there from Boston to New York, I would always think like, why is, why are people stopping here? Yeah, WWE. But a lot of people like, you know, David Letterman lived in Connecticut and drove into the city to do a show. That's how he did it. Yeah. But he's like reclusive, you know, he likes being, he needs to be away from everybody. He's weird like that. And you're not. You missed her outgoing and that city partying it up at night, doing a little blow in the morning, pep you up right before class for sure. You know me show up on the campus. Give Vince the paperwork that you wrote on the plane over there. Tony,

Speaker 3:          01:09:39       this storyline makes zero sense.

Speaker 4:          01:09:42       What kind of storylines where you plan it? Did you, I know you did. I know you thought about it. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       Absolutely. I wrote a, I wrote a great storyline where, you know, Brock Lesnar and a, in this past Wrestlemania, he beat the undertaker. The undertaker's had a streak at Wrestlemania. He never loses at Wrestlemania. He was 21 and zero all time at Wrestlemania 21 years. He had never lost in this match against Brock Lesnar. It's Sorta, it was sort of set up so everybody just assumed the undertaker would win and then in a stunning move, Brock, towards the end of it ends up beating the undertaker for the three count. You want to see something funny? Look that up. Reaction shots of the audience. Don't do that. Okay, but this audience was stunned to people. Just so I know. What else? Shots drawn that audience. A fucking simple card trick. Oh, come on. What are you talking about? Code road. Silly Shit. Okay. It's all planned out. It's obvious.

Speaker 3:          01:10:40       It's not obvious. It's definitely not. If it's planned out, why would it be? It was going to happen. I know what's going to happen. No, that's not the, that's not the arena's. Not everybody in the arena was offered a full time, one year writing job with the, they don't know what's going to happen. You're an expert and pro wrestling essentially. I've watched my whole, it was sort of like my replacement for not having a dad when I was a kid. Like, I would just sit there and watch these, these storylines and these guys do all this crazy stuff and said, well sure it was my dad replaced

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       superfly snuck. Oh, was your dad pretty much? Super Fly was one of the biggest things. I mean that's what I was doing off of couches and my tidy whities when I was a tiny little boy, Bob Backlund. I remember Bob Backlund, the creator of the cross face chicken wing, which is a great move man. Fucking time you invest in this. You should get paid by this. Seriously considered seriously consider taking that job? Uh, no. I would say no to anybody else, but you, you liked that shit so much. You've always got those fucking books. He reads books on the business of pro wrestling. We're on a fucking plane and I look over, there's people reading self help books. Some folks are reading novels. Tony H is going to fucking book the sex and politics. Ex lives in headlocks the shoe unauthorized bio of Vince Mcmahon. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 4:          01:12:08       Reading awesomeness about a guy who took a, a joke of a show and turned it into a billion dollar enterprise and wrote it all himself and is the main, you should read her book on pro wrestling. Dude, you should write a book, a love affair, pro wrestling. I love affair from Tony Hinchcliffe. I was listening to, um, to, uh, the opening Anthony Show, which is no longer the European Anthony show. Now. It's a oop with Jimmy Norton. I don't know why don't they just call it the opion Jimmy show, but whatever. Um, they had this guy on and uh, he's an author. He's, he wrote that a card movie with Kevin Spacey. He's written a bunch of 'em, a bunch of different, uh, uh, books. His name is Ben Mazur, Rich Mazza rich. And uh, he was talking about Russian oligarchs and about what happened, what went down and Russia during like, uh, the fall of the Soviet Union were seven to nine people, but soaked up 50% of the economy of Russia.

Speaker 4:          01:13:15       Yeah. Seven, seven or nine, somewhere in that number. Like no more than 10 people literally had 50% of the Russian economy and they were just killing each other. They would like kill each other and take over their businesses. Like if you had a competitor of like you were coke, you would send your army over to kill Pepsi and then you would just own Pepsi to wow. It's, it was the total complete wild, wild west. And I don't know if he's written a book on this or he's gonna write a book on this, but fucking amen. Listen to that shit. I bet he has written a book on it. I should find out what the book is been as rich Ben Mezrich. I wonder what the direction of the economy and the trends in everything we're before that exclusive group of people took that over. Cause it's, you know, it seems like we're sort of in a way, heading that direction with our stuff. The top whatever percent has such a crazy of money compared

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       to the rest of everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:14:13       Yeah. Well it's close. You know, were, were pretty bad. But, uh, apparently it's nothing like Russia, like the, these Russian oligarchs. They just dominated. They just figured out a way to completely dominate the entire economy of a giant country. I mean it's, it's listening to him talk about, it was fascinating. That shows different now that Anthony's not there, but Jimmy Norton is so fucking interesting. Hysterical. And you know, an obese doing a great job with it too. It's still a great show. This Guy Ben Mezrich was fascinating. Fuck Russia man. It's crazy. They were talking about Putin, but what a gangster Putin had to be to, to come back and lead the country after he left. Like he led the country, took off. Like they, they impose some sort of a term limit, came back like no term limit in buck. Oh, he's back again. He's, this is a second time running the country. Like he installed some sort of a puppet dictator or a puppet leader when he was gone and then came back and he's a former KGB agent. Like what the fuck man.

Speaker 3:          01:15:19       You know, there's a guy that, a professional wrestler named Marie Seth that actually Putin on the don, the mega tron and the Titan tron. Uh, every time he comes out and really gets the crowd riled up. Mother Russia, I promise I will defeat my victim for you. And it gets the whole crowd to hate him. And then I, and then a guy comes out and uh, he, it Rousseff usually wins. They let the Russian guy when cause it drives the crowd crazy. And then you think anything can happen after that. I fuck my favorite thing is to watch how you respond to me. Talk About Russ, what's wrong with you? You would love it and roll with you. I wouldn't love it. You'd be amazed. I'll bet you though. I bet you if I showed you a statistic of UFC fans being WWE fans, I bet you'd be shocked because before the UFC was all over everything. And one of the only outlets that end, by the way, I've been with the UFC since the beginning, you know what I mean? Like I mean like watching it since the hoist days, since the voice and shamrock and all that. And that's because it's, even though it's two totally different things, UFC is obviously an extremely,

Speaker 1:          01:16:26       you know,

Speaker 3:          01:16:28       crazy sport and WWE is completely entertainment with some injuries from time to time.

Speaker 1:          01:16:35       Uh, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       the, it was an outlet for anybody that wanted some crazy stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:16:42       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:16:42       Wwe and UFC fans. I bet there's a lot. I would bet you that I'm just going to wait till you're done talking. This is it. This is my, this is my closing statement. Here it is. I'll bet you that at least 70% of UFC fans have been or are a WWE fan at some point 70%.

Speaker 1:          01:16:59       I love when people throw a statistic around where they have done zero research. Just a random number, I believe 70. I do it all the time by the way. Yeah. Uh, 70 I bet. Bet 90%. No, I did. They look, it's not the God damn same. One of them is real. One of them people that are battling for their life and the most difficult contest and all the reports. Another one is some weird fucking jerk off thing that strange guys do when they sit in front of the TV and pretend they don't know it's fake, right? It's 10. No, I know it's fake. Everybody knows it's fake. You don't want to know. You shut that part of your brain off. When you watch it, you're like, like a lizard. They went to immediately to take a full time writers job. I know it's fake. Even even if you wrote it, you would still be

Speaker 9:          01:17:44       there while it happened going, I can't believe. I can't believe you would. You would have your fucking script in your hand and you'd be jumping up and down, spinning around in circles. I can't believe prompt the undertaker. Oh yeah. I'm real and Grabow worlds collide. Oh yeah. I never got to finish. So I wrote a thing to wear

Speaker 3:          01:18:14       Kane, the undertakers brother wrestled Brock Lesnar at this wrestlemania coming up in seven months or so and uh, loses but undertaker comes back. Tombstone pal drives Brock Lesnar and they walk off together. Amazing Swan Song. They wait

Speaker 9:          01:18:34       when you come up with a move. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:18:36       For a guy to win with. Yeah. Do you take into consideration at all the health of the person trying to attempt that move? It's tough. You're right. Yeah. It's tough because when Brock Lesnar did that shooting star press flipped through the air and landed on his head. I've seen that. I've seen that. Everybody see anybody like who knew about Brock Lesnar, who was researching him. Very likely if you were going through like internet videos and stuff like that, you would run into that video of him flipping off the top rope and landing on his head off 300 pounds of them landed on his head bang and kept going. Yeah. Crazy. I don't know how the fuck you lived. I know if you watched that, it looks like he's a dead man. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       Wayne's on his fucking head. Yeah. There's some stuff that just can't even, they just probably an inch either way and he's, he can't move his legs and stuff, but he survived it.

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       I don't know how he did it and then how he went on to fight actually fight, fight afterwards. Was that a big blow to the WWE when they realized that Brock Lesnar got fucked up? I do at Brown pride tattooed on his body. Oh No. I don't know what that is. What's Black Brown? Oh, Cain Velasquez. Oh No. Yeah. I didn't know he had a brown pride tattoo. How do you know him and not know he has a brown pride tattooed on his chest. It's a big point of contention. I. Dot. I don't know. I don't tell a lot of people who are white people find it quite offensive cause you could never fight with white pride tattooed on your chest.

Speaker 3:          01:19:58       Hmm. That's interesting. Yeah. Now that I'm just hearing about this for the first time, that is uh, that's, that's an interesting, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:20:04       You're alone only allowed to be proud if you're minority. If you're proud and you're a majority, you're mocking everybody else. You're gloating, you're, or you're racist trying to hold back the others. If you have black pride and no one gives you a hard time at all, you could have a tee shirt on, on television that says black pride and no one would have issue with it. But if you went on like CNN with a white pride shirt on, they might fucking kill you with rocks. Yeah, that's insane. I never thought of that before. White Man's been held down for a long time. Wow. You want to go to the meeting now? What meeting? The white pride meeting. Uh, you're willing, they're willing to join us in our ranks.

Speaker 2:          01:20:45       So you're asking me if I think it messed up the WWE. When Cain Velasquez beat Brock, I beat him so easily. I think the entire, I think Brock going into the UFC and doing anything good whatsoever completely helped the WWE and the WWE is Brock.

Speaker 1:          01:21:00       I think Brock Lesnar, no bullshit. Brock Lesnar did it the right way. Like if Brock Lesnar left the WWE and dedicated himself to becoming the best fighter in the world, I mean like best striking coaches, best Jujitsu coaches and overall coach. Like a guy like Matt [inaudible], Matt Hume, like a John Crouch, like a real MMA coach who's going to go over your game. A guy who's well versed in all the variables when it comes to fighting like a Duane Ludwig. Go over your game inside and out. Find out what they can fix it and worked on him for years. If someone did that with him and then built him up, slow it. You start out in the RFA started out in these smaller organizations and then eventually you work your way up to a larger organization and then eventually fight in the UFC when you have, you know, 1520 fights instead of your second fucking pro fight being against a former world champion.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       His second pro fight in the UFC was against frank fucking mirror. That's crazy. He fights heath herring. He fights Frank Mir. I mean that's just ridiculous. He's not ready. He could have been great though, right? He could have been an all time. Great. Yeah, he could have been an all. He's a real freak athlete, like no doubt about it. When, when he fought, he's herring was just running heath hearing over and just like, Holy Shit. The first time I saw him fight, I saw it. I saw his first fight live. I saw him fight in Hollywood. He fought in La at a, it was a k one event and it was really bizarre man. It's like Dennis Rodman was there and they were talk, everyone was talking shit about the UFC, like they were trying to get, they were trying to get, um, like some sort of publicity by like talking shit about the UFC.

Speaker 1:          01:22:44       So they hired Dennis robbed. And this was like right when Dennis Rodman was coming off of those reality shows where he's all fucked up on drugs and you know, it had metal all over his face. And he's like, yeah, UFC ain't shit compared to carry one. No, no, they didn't. And it was the first time Brock Lesnar ever fought. And, uh, I just remember he took down this guy, uh, I forget dude's name. I'm sure it's here on his website somewhere, but he, uh, took down this kind of smashed him and like in no time and I remember thinking, Ooh, that is a lot to handle. Like that's a big boy. That's not a, that's not like, I mean he's, he's fucking enormous. That's not a small guy. He's an enormous former NCAA wrestling champion. Like a real wrestler. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:23:30       You know, he's, he's unbelievable. And I mean if that bacteria infection in his stomach, that really almost killed him. I mean it really almost killed him. Uh, didn't happen. I think it could have gone a few different ways, but I think either way he would've gone back to the WWF because you can make so much money. They're doing such less work and such less training and I think he's sort of into that, cause he, they don't work him a lot. They don't work him like other wrestlers. He has a special deal where he gets paid millions in, has to show up maybe 20 times a year, a couple of Monday nights, he's comes out, pops corn, jumps up and down, goes back, you know, his manager does all the talking. You can't beat my client and he's just standing there looking cool. And how can we move to the back? He has a better deal than everybody else. Cause he's Brock Lesner, he's the, he's, he's known as a, you know, a killer. Is he the guy that's like the most respected God? I can't believe I'm asking you to tell me any questions and see the guys the most respect. Ronda Rousey was at raw on Monday with the four horse women. I wonder why she was, you think maybe she got paid for that, but that's what they do. That's what, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, that's the old thing.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       Yeah. In 2075, this guy, Troy hung, he was supposed to fight Choi Hong Man. But uh, that guy got injured and they replaced him with a guy named min suit Kim. And he crushed him in one minute and nine seconds the first round, and then his second fight was against Frank Mir. So ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:25:02       Yeah. The 360 favorite video ever. My favorite Internet video ever. The buffer three 60 and that's when you interview or does he do it between Brock and Lesner? Yeah. Yeah, it shows him right there. Shows talking to Brock right there.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       He made his debut in the UFC. His first fight against Frank Mir. Unfucking believable. Yeah, that's what, that's one of the craziest things I've ever heard in my life. And then he fought a heath herring and his next fight. It's crazy. Absolutely crazy. The next fight after that, he fought for the title and beat Randy couture. Wrap your fucking head around. That does wrap your head around that. The guy fought twice in the UFC, one against Frank Mir, one against heath herring, and then his next fight is Randy couture for the title, his fourth fucking fight in MMA. He Beats Randy coture for the heavyweight title. Legitimately knocked him out, dropped him and stopped him on the ground. I mean, that, that's just fucking crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Really is fucking crazy man. He's a monster athlete and they have the belt on him right now and it's, it's good draws a lot of people. It draws a lot of people in. Yeah. And uh, you know, they made, they wrote a great one for this last one tip for him to win the championship. He just completely dominated the good guy. Normally it's a back and forth battle. Whoa. But this was completely one side. It's something like 16 German suplex is, and by the way, that that guy's landing on the back of his neck, just like Brock and that shooting star press. Some of these were sloppy and that Brock undertaker match. He literally gave the undertaker concussion. It was bad. It was sloppy. It wasn't supposed to go this way. But when Brock hits those German suplex is, even though they're paying them a lot of money, he's nowhere near the technical wrestler.

Speaker 3:          01:26:49       Like the guys that were, had been built in, built in the machine. So when he hits a German suplex and he throws a man over his head, he's not, the guys can land on their neck and head and stuff and the undertaker was in bad shape. So Brock, sort of one of the guys that's sort of a liability, like he can take a guy out even though you don't want him to. How many of those dudes have like neck surgery? Almost all of them. Nick Foley, who I opened up for a couple of weeks ago, known as mankind. Dude love Cactus Jack. The multiple personalities restless literally is having back surgery or right now. Really? Yup. And he's had something like a 47 broken bones. It's all real. He's missing his right ear. He, he's missing his ear. What happened was here it fell off. It fell off during a match. This is the guy that took the dive off the hell on the cell versus the undertaker through it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       Oh, that guy. Nobody fucking knows about that.

Speaker 3:          01:27:43       Right? Nobody knows. Nobody knows.

Speaker 1:          01:27:46       This is the guy that did the thing we all talk about.

Speaker 3:          01:27:49       Yeah. I'm telling you, it was like the, uh, it's like the nine 11 of the WWF,

Speaker 1:          01:27:54       so he's ear fell off. Was it a cauliflower ear? Was it that that happens in MMA fight sometimes, yeah. Cause it's so, you know what call it failure. Yeah, I used to Russell's it, yeah. When your blood leaks into your ear it hardens and becomes like calcium. And so like when people look at people with like fucked up years from grappling, those things are hard and sometimes when they get hit it literally breaks the skin and it tears off. Like chunks of people's ears have fallen off during fights and like landed on the ground inside the octagon.

Speaker 3:          01:28:25       I wrestled for four years in high school and uh, my senior year I remember I didn't get cauliflower ear but some stuff broke up up there and the top of my right ear was black for like a month. And it really freaked me out. I didn't, I didn't ever look into what it was they did was my coach is just like, we'll put some extra padding in your head gear. And so I had one side that stuck out more than the other side.

Speaker 1:          01:28:46       I always wear head gear, man. I don't want the I, the problem with cauliflowers you, everybody's like, yeah, makes you look tough, but it also affects the way you're hearing works, right? Like the design of your ear evolution as sort of created this thing that allows you to best capture the sound around you. It's like, it's not like a cute look at the reason why your ears shaped like that. I always tell people, take your ear and then take the top of your ear and then fold it down and listen to how different shit sounds and then let it go. Like take that and just cover it up and then let it go when it's covered up. That's how Randy coture hears all the time. Like that's what his hearing is like and his ear hole is this tiny little thing like, well, lead Ishmael is this a famous Jujitsu fighter?

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       They call them the leg, his ears. It's like he has too hard, like a, like a mouse sized thing stuffed into each ear. It's like they open his ear up, stuffed this hard mouse thing like so. His whole is like so tiny. No Q tips for that guy. He's not using any cute tips. If he does, he's a cute dude. He's got a force that bitch in there and you're never going to get it out. It's like he's got little tiny tiny holes. That's, that's bad. You're not supposed to do that. Yeah, but people like it. They like it because it makes them look like fucking bad asses. I don't know. I think he's responsible for a lot of fighters. Bad choices and walk in music. Oh Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:30:12       Getting music by the way. That's my favorite thing. They probably have no idea what they're listening to. I love that part of everything. Especially the UFC because it is so crazy. Like the quiet before the storm and some people pick the worst song.

Speaker 1:          01:30:28       Well you know what's fucked up? This dude Roy Mcdonald's is one of the top fighters in the UFC. He's a top contender in the welterweight division is bad motherfucker. Oh, he's had bad walking music. Like one time he came out to can't touch this. I was mocking him. I had to, I was goofing on it. I was like, ah, is this great song back in the day, by the way. Yeah. Props to MC hammer frosty and I have a thing has come and gone. We always talk about we go,

Speaker 3:          01:30:54       we will make predictions right off of that. Every single fight.

Speaker 1:          01:30:57       What happened was Rory wasn't picking his walking music. He changed his phone number. He moved from Vancouver area to Montreal and he changed his phone number and the guy who got his old phone number was a fan. Just a rant. It happened to be a fan because in Vancouver in that area Colona where he's from is fucking huge. He's a huge star. Like when he fought in Vancouver, people went nuts. They were so psyched to see him there. So this guy just happened to get his phone number happened to be a fence when they texted him, what do you want for your walk up Music Rory? He's like, what? Oh my God. So he never told anybody and he had this phone number for years. He was giving shitty walking music to Roy. We titled that is Hilarious. And then finally Rory called up the number or something like that. They were like finally figured out that he wasn't really Rory. Wow. We're hey. Like they said to Rory, you know we get your text for all your song picks. He's like, what? I'm not sending any texts. Oh, I didn't fucking say what number were you texting?

Speaker 9:          01:32:00       And then he realized it was his old number. That's so funny. The guy must have been in home just giggling like, like a child when can't touch this came on. He wants to be like came touches dude. You didn't walk in. Music is so powerful because you could psych out in yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:19       Opponent with walk in music if it's done properly. If it's some, if it's some subtle crazy stuff, you know? No, you can't. Little bit

Speaker 9:          01:32:30       me can wrestling. You're look around. What is that trembling? He's playing that. Who's that? Phil Collins. I can feel it in here. You think? I believe this is my song.

Speaker 3:          01:32:45       I think if you're on, if you're fighting in the UFC and you come out first, you add your song. Let's say your songs like a seven on a one to 10 and then lights go out and Phil Collins in the air tonight does come in. You're not a little bit like, fuck, I wish I would've picked this guy he's already got, he's already got one on me is already willing to one below. And that's the intro.

Speaker 9:          01:33:08       You need to call Vince Mcmahon right now. You think like a fucking pro wrestling fan. Can I say that? With all due respect? I'm not, I'm not hating on it. But you think like you, you take any joy in that stupidity. I know I do. It's entertaining as hell. Vince, why are you slipping? This is the management. Turn your organization around your them either and they should call you the mastermind and they should make you a character as well. I agree with you. Where those gold wrestling shoes, that's your whole outfit. It's shiny gold.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       I'm the mastermind. Good to be here in Vancouver, right?

Speaker 9:          01:33:48       Oh, what's wrong? You don't like my plans for the future. I can feel it. Oh my God. Yeah. There's an article.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       Go on bloody elbow.com if you go to bloody elbow.com and read about the, if you're a UFC fan, it's by our friend Crooklyn Stephie Daniels who wrote this story about, Oh, this imposter choosing Roy McDonald's walk up music for years. For fucking years. The dude did it. Oh, oh my God. It's so funny, man.

Speaker 9:          01:34:23       Oh, it even says how I was making fun of them.

Speaker 1:          01:34:30       Oh man, this sucks a little bit. For folks who don't know, I'm a big Roy McDonald Fan and you, you actually hear his voice during the, when you hear Joe Rogan podcast, check it out. That's Roy. Oh, that's him from one of the, and then the other one is Nick Diaz going train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. It's a greatest quote of all time of my entire career by the way. I just think this, this dude, I want to interview this guy. Whoever the guy is, he's hilarious, man. Whoever that dude,

Speaker 9:          01:34:58       but it's like he had a loopy fiasco, light work. That was one of them. Rihanna, we found love. That was another one. But he came in with good ones. Like he had Metallica seek and destroy. That's a good one, Huh? Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. And then, uh, he had a violin orchestra for one of them. I see. I think that would be awesome. Yeah. Why not, right? Yeah. Just something different. Something different. Make the opponent wonder. Wow, what's the psychological plan here? What is it about all that stuff, even though you know it's total 100% horseshit. What is it about that stuff that's appealing to you? The Entertainment Gel. If you watch one of these things, you would, you would see what you liked about it and you would have a few favorites and no, no. I'd go fucking crazy. And I'd watch lions killing gazelles on television because that's real.

Speaker 9:          01:35:51       That's what I'd do. I'd grab my laptop and I'd be like, yeah, you watched this fake shit all day. I need real, I need real. I can't get entertained by frank, but that's what TV shows. The movies are there. Fake. No, no, they're not. Fake sports are real and that I understand, and this is sports entertainment. It's not, it's not. We're not. Nobody's saying it's really when you watch game of Thrones and you watch a guy get his head cut off, you know what it looks like. Yeah. It looks like a guy actually getting his head cut off. It looks real. When I watch wrestling and I see a guy get hit and go turned to the crowd, I know that's bullshit. Right? It's offensive to me. It's offensive. Yeah, and the idea is other moves that happen that are amazing. Nope. Nope, nope. They're all offensive.

Speaker 9:          01:36:40       Oh No. I know they take athleticism to pull off, but they're offensive because I'm so aware. It's so in my face that this is not really happening. I can't be the guy in the gold suit holding on to the script, jumping around and place going. Her lost the streak has bed proud again. That's what you would do. You would freak the fuck out. He wouldn't run around. I wouldn't do that. You would if you were hired. If I had a gold suit I would do that, but I don't have a cold. I can see you doing it. Vince is fucking up. Really needs to make you a part of it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       I told him Tony when immediately you should do it and I can't believe you didn't take it Tony cause that is the leg one of the biggest things for for you because you are that. That's what trying to negotiate doing it part time from La. That would be awesome. That would, that would be best for both sides because I wouldn't get burned out on it and they would have awesome, great ideas that are hip and cool and I would have been able to do what I wanted.

Speaker 9:          01:37:37       Hip and cool. Whenever guys says my ideas are hip and cool, I'll go. Are you sure the pins, what ideas he's talking about has a scarf. Scarf. It's a scarf with little skulls all over it. Like he's a pirate and he's drinking a Frappaccino. Are you ever saw this one caring? Yes. Undertaker has gone. Metro, Metro, sexual undertaker. Maybe if you changed. All of a sudden Tony starts working for them and every character becomes gay and it turns out that there's someone who's sprinkling gay dust overall. The other competitors where there in the locker room, there's, he's turning. That's the, that's a plot that Tony comes up when he turns the entire roster gay. It turns out there's an openly gay wrestler and he has gay fairy dust. Okay, well he was, he didn't like a leprechauns ball sack. You read, kill the Leprechaun and turned his ball sack until like this. Are you ready for this? What if I were to tell you that there is an openly gay wrestler that blows dust in people's spaces? Fuck that. His name is gold dust. No fucking way. There he is right there.

Speaker 9:          01:38:55       Yeah, Dude. This is in the WWE. Dustin Rhodes, a third generation rest. What's going on with his Dick? That's gold dust. You've heard a horsepower that's like related to the dusty roads? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, how did it, how did she know about that? See Rhodes to be eight. This shit made sense. Thank you Jeff. This guy's real. Please. I need to see more. I can't believe I invented a guy that already exist. Yeah you can. You should be writing this. That's him and his uh, insurance cell phone when he takes off the wagon robe and he flirts with them in the ring and Shit blows and kisses and they get all riled up and then he can beat him with shit cause they were like all I'm not gay. Get away from me. And he's like, oh yeah, come here. Beautiful. And they're

Speaker 4:          01:39:43       did the WWE, he should hire Michael Sam as soon as he's done with the Dallas cowboys. He's the openly gay NFL player. I don't, I don't know. He's not good enough to make the team and just bringing them for the practice squad. They need to bring that dude into WWE and actually fuck a guy on TV. Well him and gold dust. Yeah, but gold does is faking it. I could tell it. Look it up. My Guy Straight. Yeah, he's super straight. Is super straight. That's the cat whisperer guy, isn't it? The same actor guy as the cat whisperer. What's the cat whisperer? The TV show. What's that? It's a show where this, it's like the dog whisperer, but for cats. Oh God, really? Here's how you fix it. Cat Rocks.

Speaker 9:          01:40:25       Dusty Rhodes is his dad and he has a brother named Cody Rhodes funk.

Speaker 4:          01:40:29       Problem solved. I actually have a coyote issue, my neighborhood now, cause I have so many chickens. These coyotes are circling my house on a daily basis. Every time I come home there's coyotes around my gate now. Oh Shit. It's creepy. Fucked your chickens ever wake up in the middle of the night and wake you up. No. Chickens don't wake up at night. They sleep all night. In fact, you can go, I can go in the chicken house at night and just pick them up. They're just sitting there. You just grab them. I pick them up and him. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Don't make a little more in south central. Are they just all night long or is that roosters? Roosters, yeah. Yeah. That's Mexican guys. Love it. I don't say this, you know, I'm not generalized sizing generals, Isaac's generalizing, but a lot like my friend, my friend, uh, I don't want to say his name. He's a older gentleman that happens to be a, a guy I've known for decades. Mexican dude. He, he keeps roosters in his yard. Like he has, I want to say he has a hundred chickens. It's close to a hundred chickens. Wow. And he uses him for fighting. Like they gamble on it. It's just been a part of their culture for as long as they can remember a hundred chicken, they have like an arena that has like a barn and they take these friends come over, they cook a goat, they could goats and a, it's really crazy. Like that's also a normal part of their culture.

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       And he was renting a house once and he was telling me the story of how ridiculous it was. And he was like a, they got in trouble for butchering of goat cause someone, uh, someone called it in on them and you know, the, the landlord said you can't do that. You can't butcher goat is like, it's not weekly. We left home alone, you know, so he didn't like cut it open and just leave the guts out so the neighborhood smells it. He goes like, he's like, we eat it. Yeah. And he goes, but I could cook hamburgers in my yard and no one have a problem with it. But he was like, but this goat, like I know how healthy it is. I know that it's, it's good meat. I know how fresh it is. Like we kill that goat and then they roast it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       They have like a, like a, like a barbecue and a bunch of guys would come over and they would eat goat and get drunk and have rooster fights. Wow. Yeah. And it's a tall, I mean we think it's fucked up, but it's a total normal part of their culture. Yeah. And they eat the chickens. I mean, after it's all over, it's kind of fucked up. Cause they do make these chickens fight to the death. But after it's over, they turned him into soup. But so it's like, I, you know, part of me says it's animal cruelty of the, the biggest part. Like my gut reaction. I look at that. Should that be legal? Wow. Oh that's kind of a fucked up thing to do. It's kind of a fucked up thing to put razor blades in the end of a chicken's foot and stick them in a cage and another chicken. They fucking, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:43:08       they should just do fake chicken fighting. See, I'm a gay chicken. Come Alvin the blonde wig and all right guys. I lost Sean that it's gotta be real chicken.

Speaker 1:          01:43:20       Can't believe it's gold guys real. I came up with a guy who blows dust.

Speaker 3:          01:43:24       No, his dad, you named it dusty Rhodes. Let them know that he exists and he's got a brother named Cody Rhodes who just made the jump to being star dust, which is the, uh, he's like the, he's like another version of gold dust except up now they roll together. So he's gay too. Now star dust is more like, just like about the cosmos and like, ah, I just can't believe all the magical things. So yeah. So he's high. Yeah. So he's like a stone or stone to the gills. Oh, that's so funny. Except he's just on, you never know. Do you think that it's possible to, Tony could get me to like pro wrestling? Yes. Oh, I know for a fact, dude. I would know. I knew the exact match is the videos, the moves, the everything that would, that would interest you or see too much real. There's some crazy submission moves that a no, no, no, no, no. That was the last day.

Speaker 1:          01:44:16       That's the last thing you want to show me. Don't that'll get me angry. I'd be like, that wouldn't work, right. No defense here. Hip Escape. He can get out of there. Nothing drives me crazier than like a fake submission move in a movie. That shit drives me nuts. You know, I stopped watching Dexter because fucking, what's his name from third rock? John Lithgow. John Lithgo have this chicken, a rear naked choke in a bathtub and he, and he killed her that way and I was like, oh my God, that's the worst fucking room naked choke I've ever seen. That's so fake. She's not even red. I'm done. And I shut it off. I walked out of the room and discussed and I'd never watched another episode of Dexter again. Wow. Yeah. You can't show me a fake rear naked choke. You fucks that. That makes me angry. That's like if you were watching a Jimi Hendrix bio, pick a non bio pic, but like a you one of those movies where it's a fake look. An actor plays Jimmy Hendrix. I guess that's a bio pic, right? Yeah. And some do didn't know how to play guitar and he's like Kinda around. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:45:18       and you'd be like, no, y'all got doing it. You're not doing it at all

Speaker 1:          01:45:22       playing guitar. That's what John Lithgow is Shitty fucking Renee get choked did for me.

Speaker 8:          01:45:27       The only reason I think you would maybe like it in the future is that you like, you know, UFC so much an MMA and Jujitsu so much and Tony gets it together with a bunch of people and watches it. A lot of them watch it as a joke and where Tony I think takes it a little bit

Speaker 3:          01:45:42       serious tone. We all watched it as a joke. I can I not buying, I joke. I just see and recognize what's entertaining about it and I do like the ideology of stunning and arena of people. Sometimes that happens, it can happen. You have to look at the reaction is the three hour like job interview for you. This is like your audition tape. They should fucking hire you. They should figure it out. I need you to pull this up. Where are you, man? Listen, take the needle out of your ass and hire this guy. You're crazy not to. You should have seen the looks on these people's faces. When Brock Lesnar beat the undertaker, nobody thought it was going to happen. Oh my God, what did they do, Tony? Imagine if on Saturday the fuck is wrong with you. Nobody thought it was going to happen. It was amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:46:35       It was fake as fuck dude. But nobody thought it was going to happen. A lot of things are fake that nobody thought was going to happen. Tony, Tony, Tony at the time, imagine if that guy who filled in for that shit's gay on Saturday and he took on Dillashaw. Imagine if in the miracle he was able to somehow land a punch on Dillashaw beat him, the place would have been. I mean, well it's sort of weird cause that's Sacramento and that's Dillashaw his hometown. But I'm just saying like in a neutral field, that would have been stunning and everybody would have known that they just witnessed history. Tony, that would have been real.

Speaker 9:          01:47:09       Right. It wasn't even real to really happen movement. It really knocked out a professional athlete to guys who've trained to fight their entire lives. It's real. Right, right. I understand you. You're so crazy. You, by the way, this stuff is trying to sell insurance here. I understand where your concerns are, but let me just show you the details of our policy. You're a crazy person. No, I'm telling you why

Speaker 3:          01:47:37       there's millions and millions of WWE and I'm telling you why. Maybe hunters Thompson was just a couple of decades off when it was predicting the end of the world. Those guys, they mean it's not easy. If, for example, Brock was furious when Vince told him that he wanted him to beat the undertaker that day, like in real life like Betty was, and you were there to see it. No, but I talked to somebody who was, oh, I bet he was honest with you. It's not like they lie all day. Every day. Tony's going to talk to some people. Let me tell you a little, I'll tell you what. Brock was actually mad. He was really mad. He had read the script and you just start. Dose is bullshit. I'm not picking a fuck. You don't undertake some of the guys that work. Unlike the technical side for the UFC work for the WWE heard Brock was crying. That's what I heard was Brock went to the hospital with the undertaker, cried, so hardy dehydrated himself. After that match, they had to give them an IV to replenish. His team thought he killed the undertaker from that

Speaker 9:          01:48:37       Kachin. It was bad, bad. It was real. The concussions are real. You can't, you can't, I don't even buy it was a real concussion. They probably faked a concussion. Take her to the hospital. He's got up oboe and even on the real booboo folks, if you don't think it's a real blue blah, show you the fucking band aid on it. My four year old pitching something at four year olds, so booboo, it is a booboo and need up their day. Honey, there's no, he's not even bleeding. You don't need a bandaid. Oh, I want a bandaid. Okay, well band, they make you feel better. We'll get you a bandaid. It took the undertaker and put a bandaid on them.

Speaker 9:          01:49:30       Tony Hinchcliffe in a gold suit holding the script. I can't believe it's our real, he's jumping up and down and circles and Vince Mcmahon is stand there shaking his head. Color of purple. I'll fucking pent up with rage. That's how I it down. It's a booboo. Look at the bandaid. It's real. It's a real bandaid. Ladies and gentlemen, if you doubt it. What else do you like? That sucks. Um, let's see. What else do I liked? It sucks. Uh, I guess I play fantasy football. I don't talk about that a lot. Well, fantasy football is at least based on fucking football, right? Which is a real game. People are really trying and shit really happens, but nobody knows what's going to happen in real sports. My God. Isn't that part of what makes it exciting? You fucking Weirdo. Same thing about the eat. Oh Shit. He don't know what's going to happen. You don't know what's going to happen. You predicted a writer? No. The writer knows what's going to happen. Oh, the writer knows it's not real. It's like a play. Do you like musicals now? I've been the one gay or than musicals. How about that? That doesn't make sense. Sure it does. It's dudes are hugging. They get all sweaty. They're laying on each other. They're an and it's not real. Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:51:03       I mean, after musicals guys are banging, but do you know, I don't know if they're banging. I don't go to those things. I'm not in that world. You've seen a musical, right? Yeah. I've seen a bunch of musicals. Not that there's anything wrong with being gay, by the way, but musicals are gay. They just are. It really is. It really is. Unless it's a humorous musical. Yeah. Even then it's even then he made someone kisses ass. Right. Uh, that's someone else. That's a Photoshop, isn't it? Yeah. That's not the real, who's that guy? That's a fake guy.

Speaker 9:          01:51:38       Probably one of you out there. We'll just go look for it. That's the thing about the Internet, man. There's a photo of you out there somewhere. Someone's Photoshop to Dick in your mouth or you kissing ass or you doing something ridiculous and over my Mustang, but why did he do that as a challenger? Why did he do that? Why he pulled his pants down and made someone kisses ass on TV? Probably. That sounds like something he would do, but he did. You know it. Why are you pretending you didn't watch that one? It spits back thinking they think that was over like 1213 years ago. Something like that. You weren't there yet, Huh? No, I can't remember. I can't remember. I don't believe it. I think you're being mocked. That may have been during the period where, why don't you guys kissed his ass?

Speaker 9:          01:52:23       Fuck your brother. Backyard wrestling. Kind of gauge how many people in the audience though. That's insane. Plus it's been winning the Monday night cable wars for over 20 years. Think about that for a second. Every Monday night at wins, every single month they pulled TNA though. They pulled TNA from, yeah, from a spiky expenses competition. What's the problem with TNA? I'm just not good enough. Everything's terrible. They're just completely, it's not even in the snow. That's what it should be. Bribed. But it's not, it's not even in the same ballpark. What is it? Well, they used to have like a lot of the MMA guys would do it. Like King Mo was in TNA and rampages and TNA. There's not good. No, no. That's wrong with it. Bad writing, bad everything. Could you go over there? Maybe ma'am, yes or no? I don't want you don't turn down the WWE TNA.

Speaker 9:          01:53:12       Listen, you could be the fucking mogul. What do they give you a piece of the action. What is DNA said? Listen, we heard you on the Joe Rogan podcast. We'd liked the way you think about wrestling. I think this organization has still has some life and we're willing to uh, willing to cut you in on this. Give you 10% of the action. I don't own 10% of TNA. I'm pretty sure 10% of the TNA wouldn't even get me what I would have made with the WWE. You son of a bitch. Yeah. They just lost the TV deal. They don't have a TV deal. Yeah, they're done and maybe it'll get picked up by like lifetime. Vince Mcmahon beat Ted Turner. What does Ted Turner, CNN, CNN, TNT, TBS heat through Ted Turner at open checks that he would, he would just sign any wrestler back and uh, they were having wars on Monday nights.

Speaker 9:          01:53:58       They'd go against each other. Vince, WWE on the USA network and TNT had nitro and Ted Turner said, whatever we need to do to beat Vince Mcmahon, I will write the check to whoever's they offered. They bought hall Kogan they bought all these, this, he believes this. I was there. I was in the room. No, I didn't say I was there and he'll just willing to spend whatever it takes. That sounds like a plot, like a plot in like two different, no, I'm, this is where it's real. Just part's real. That's the problem. You've cried wolf through this whole podcast. I never said it was really also about Santa Claus repeating that it's not real and I'm agreeing with you and now you're trying to tell us that the boogie man is real. That's what you're doing.

Speaker 9:          01:54:40       Wrestling. So real. I said that it's going to write it. How much did Ted Turner spin millions and millions to buy good. The guys that were already developed from the WWF, he bought all their biggest guys hoodie by Hulk Hogan. A macho man. Randy Savage, you know, macho man, dusty Rhodes. I'm a slim Jim Fan. Right. Snapping list. Then shit, dusty Rhodes, he bought them all. And how did it do, they ended up winning the wars for a bunch of weeks in a row. They did. Yeah. It turned it. Yeah. For like a year in a row. And uh, but then Vince, uh, bought Mike Tyson and made him referent match at Wrestlemania with Steve Austin and shut Michelson that it dominated. The rest is history. That's it. One move. Yup. You know, that's all it takes. Sometimes just one move like Hugh grant being on tonight show was what won the tonight show the rating more and it was like this rating more. And then Jay Leno got Hugh grant on after Hugh grant got busted with a squeaker gas

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       dot. Merera would say, okay. Yeah. Scag it black prostitutes ticket. Skanky yeah. Remember that chick? He got up and you could, uh, she was advertising online like as a hooker, like for the longest time. I know if it still is, but like escort, like this was the girl who got arrested with you, grant that you could fuck her. Like that was like the selling point. And that one thing when Jay Leno had him on the couch, he goes, what the hell were you thinking? Yeah. That one on the ratings war. How that happens. Like that crazy. What do you, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:56:18       because it's amazing that, uh, you know, I just liked David Letterman a lot more than Jay Leno and to think that, you know, using some scum buckets, scummy life is a launching pad that Jay can pass up a guy like Letterman and

Speaker 4:          01:56:35       by scum buckets, gummy life. I'm talking about Hugh Grant, awesome dude who takes crazy chances that are entertaining. Like Hugh grant, really, if it wasn't for that, a lot of people got a lot of enjoyment out of the fact that he got busted with a hooker. I don't think it's good what he did, but I don't necessarily think it's bad either. You know, he wanted something dangerous in his life. He's a movie star. He's living in this fucking ridiculous life. He has that beautiful woman for a wife. What was her name? The one the, the same chick who was involved recently, Elizabeth Hurley. Remember God damn, she was hot, but it's ridiculously hot. He's like, I don't care. I need something dangerous.

Speaker 4:          01:57:16       You got a streetwalker. What did anything Murphy do? Trains. Does anybody talk about that? Like how does that never get brought up at, he gets brought up. Why Eddie Murphy doesn't go on stage anymore. I guarantee you that you're probably connected. It's gotta be right. That's got to mess with them. Dude. I was at a comedy show with Charlie Murphy and some dude was heckling from the audience by cackling Charlie Murphy and Charlie was, Charlie got real with the guy. You know, like the guy said something to him and Charlie was like, yeah, yeah, listen, that's my brother and I'll fuck you.

Speaker 4:          01:57:52       It was like really that simple. It's like all the comedy got dropped and then the dude was in the audience and you realize, I know he's only about 30 or 40 feet between him and Charlie Murphy. Like that's a real person. You can't just, you can't just mock a guy's brother like that and not expect something to go have go wrong. Yeah. Yeah. My friend, uh, I won't say his name, but uh, it was one of the police officers that was involved in one of those altercations with Eddie Murphy where there was once he was helping a gentleman home, a gentleman that likes to dresses ladies and uh, it was just trying to help somebody out. No big deals. Big Best understanding. And your friend's a cop. My friend Beverly Hills Cop, he uh, worked for the police force. I don't believe it was Beverly hills, but I guess it's okay. Got It. Banana

Speaker 10:         01:58:41       in the tailpipe. It's a banana in the tailpipe. Trick

Speaker 1:          01:58:51       for me as a, as a comic, like as a young comic, I can't imagine how guys, like we talked about this yesterday with dom, how guys just stop. Like with Steve Martin, they just stop. But to be a guy like Eddie Murphy and stop. If you ever go back and watch Eddie Murphy delirious. It's hard because it's, it's difficult for those things to hold up today like they did back then, but when I was a kid and like whatever a year it was, maybe it was like 86 or something like that where Eddie Murphy delirious came on. He was a destroyer of worlds. He was so funny. We were over. My friend Jimmy lost his house. You're watching it with Jimmy and John Battle Rocco and John's sister and I think a bunch of people there. We were crying. Laughing. Yeah. At Eddie Murphy delirious. We couldn't believe how funny it was.

Speaker 1:          01:59:37       It was just insane. Oh my God. It's a funny is before I ever even thought about doing standup comedy and the idea that that guy is still around by the way, looks fantastic. Yeah, I was going to say that's the red leather, right? Yeah, no, what I mean today, it looks fantastic. I saw Eddie Murphy in Maui about two years ago. Just totally random. I was there with my family and I ran into a Eddie's cousin, uh, at the, uh, at the desk, at the check in desk and was like, what's up dude? What are you doing? He's like, Oh shit, Charlie's here. You know, go say hi. And so we went over and said Hi. And he's with Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy looks like he's 30 years old. Wow. I mean, I don't know how old he is now. He's gotta be in his fifties right? Yeah. Because when I was 18 or something like that, 19 delirious came out and he was, he got here like 24, 25 back then. So he's gotta be in his fifties. He looks fucking great. Yeah. So whatever he's doing, keep it up.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       Yeah. It's black skin too though. Yeah. Black people have black don't crack, you know, straight the way better aging. Like really blonde folks, you know, like a, those really Nordic looking, those motherfuckers wrinkle up like an old catcher's Mitt. Yeah. Oh, just turns in on itself. It's oily skin like, like the dark and dark skin to cause that dark skin doesn't get fucked up by the sun. You know, Melanin, Melanin protects you from all the shit that white people are always worried about. You know, they're always putting fucking sunscreen on. Yeah. That's why like you can like look at Oprah. How old is she? She looks great with the makeup on in real life. You don't think so? Oh No. Uh, if it's, if people saw what Oprah looked like in real life, she'd be dealing with, uh, she'd be in the next WWF superstar. Amazing. That Oprah is one of the few people that's gotten by. Like few people. That's a woman without ever selling herself as a sexual object. You got like your Barbara Walters

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       characters. He got like your news people and you've got Oprah.

Speaker 3:          02:01:45       Well, she's never had a choice. Right? She's never, it's pretty easy to not be a sex object when you can't be a sex object. She's like one of them

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       main points against the, you know, the only way a woman gets on television if she's like the biggest fucking, if you, if you had a deal, you got to like look at biggest stars, like biggest stars in the country. She's top 10 of the everyone doing everything, whether they're singers, whether they're actors, top 10 and I mean, she's done some acting like she was in the color purple, but you can't really call her an actor. Right. You know, she's really just a personality. And just from being a personality, she's one of the most famous people ever. Yeah. Tony, would you fuck Oprah or Ellen?

Speaker 9:          02:02:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:30       Um, I or both.

Speaker 4:          02:02:32       If you had a choice between either or or both. I would have to be Allen. I mean, really a no brainer either or. Both of you seen Oprah with no makeup? No. But have you done accessing?

Speaker 9:          02:02:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:02:45       Have you ever done ecstasy? I think you'd do both.

Speaker 3:          02:02:48       No. I know I would have chosen love with Oprah. Right. So, I mean, it depends if like, am I at, am I in Oprah's, you know, a $30 million compound. I might be more a little more easily swayed, you know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          02:03:03       Be like a girl would be if she went over a guy's house, he picked her up in a Lamborghini and drove her.

Speaker 3:          02:03:08       Pretty sure Oprah is a billionaire with a B man. There's something a little bit hot about that it, there you go. Look at that. Or she is, fuck yeah. For all of you that have ever wanted a bone, a rampage Jackson.

Speaker 4:          02:03:22       Oh my son

Speaker 9:          02:03:28       can't believe it.

Speaker 4:          02:03:32       You're a terrible person.

Speaker 9:          02:03:34       I have always made fun of people. I like, I like picking on people.

Speaker 4:          02:03:38       You, you almost play a character. You play kind of like a evil person. So you're almost playing a wrestler in real life.

Speaker 9:          02:03:46       Yeah. I say I like, uh, I like picking on people. That's my move.

Speaker 4:          02:03:51       That's your move. If you're a wrestler, yeah. He'd be the guy that gets under everybody's. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:03:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:03:56       Sticks and stones. I want to break your bones, but my words will hurt you. I want to take you back. Tony, do you remember this? Oh yeah, I do remember that so clearly.

Speaker 11:         02:04:12       Wow. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:04:13       This is an interesting time to drop this.

Speaker 10:         02:04:22       Wow.

Speaker 3:          02:04:24       Now to most people, this is just shitty fucking music.

Speaker 10:         02:04:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:04:29       People were complaints so hard or my message, I played this I love, I was like, I understand the

Speaker 4:          02:04:37       grateful dead now. I really do get it. I never got what everybody was into with the grateful dead until I did DMT with this plane in the background. By the way, a fighter comes out to this music, that fighter in the rings like, fuck man, I don't want him to fucking fight this guy. This is some shade. Yeah. This guy's got extra pack and some extra confidence. I worked out to this. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Put me in a weird place, man. I was high as fuck. Yeah, you can get high and listen to this and it takes you like really close to that place. That's what's fucked up. It's like you have some weird memory of like psychedelic trips. Yeah. But when you have a psychedelic trip that's connected to music, when you hear the music again, can recall some of the psychedelic trip.

Speaker 2:          02:05:30       I remember specifically the last time I heard this song, I was watching 70 pope's do the robot

Speaker 11:         02:05:37       pope's pope hats. Wow.

Speaker 10:         02:05:40       Anyway,

Speaker 2:          02:05:45       there it goes. That a WWE writing Gig,

Speaker 10:         02:05:47       right?

Speaker 4:          02:05:50       No, you're going to come in as the wizard. Now. You're going to come in as the showman. Uh, you're going to bring in Sharmans to change change the course of events. That was pretty intense, Huh? Tony didn't have any plans on doing DMT either until we went to Texas until 40 minutes before it happened. Yeah. Yeah. You weren't sure if you're going to do it or not. Yeah. I didn't bring it up. Brought it up like right before you want to do this. And he was like, what? [inaudible] which is the best way to do it. Yeah. Don't think about that shit. Just dive in. Especially DMT. Yeah. But, but if you're worried about it, don't do it. Right. But you did it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:30       Anything that lasts a 10 or 15 minutes, I could always do. Yeah. But that 10 or 15 minutes will change everything. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:06:39       So much fun. What was surprising about it? Um, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:06:48       just the, just the overall visions and craziness and the mellow chillness of everything and it was just a very cozy environment and everything. The experience.

Speaker 11:         02:07:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:07:02       What did you expect versus what it actually was?

Speaker 11:         02:07:06       MMM.

Speaker 2:          02:07:08       I didn't expect much. I don't know anything about it, so I didn't know it. I don't know anything about it going into it. That's really crazy. Yeah. That's probably why I just knew that I had done mushrooms four days before, so I'm like, all right, perfect. You are primed. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          02:07:24       Yeah. As a part of Ari Shaffir shroom fest, which is by the way, growing people are doing it all over the world and my God, he announces that people, people get on shrooms all over the world. During that same week,

Speaker 2:          02:07:35       we had so much fun man. That night that I went there, there was a meteor shower and all out meteor shower and it was like a plan thing all over the news like media shower tonight if you just so happen to look at the right time. And we're out in the middle of the desert where if there is a shoe you see, you see a shooting star on a non meteor shower night once every few minutes. And this was just a shower of meteors with a super moon because that's what he scheduled shroom fest around. So supermoon meteor shower, lightening storm miles away and one patch of the desert, just lightening crazy beautiful bolts and a cloud's supermoon and um, and then when the sun came up, you know, it's that weird desert thing where it's still dark on one side and there's a moon and the sun coming up on the other. And a nice warm shower. Rain started. We were just like in heaven. We were just cracking up for seven hours straight. It was insane. And I've done three shroom fest with Ari and I've always said, you know, it's, it's better than Christmas, it's the best holiday

Speaker 4:          02:08:39       did. There's something beautiful about getting together with a bunch of people having that kind of an experience together. Just wish you could do it without actually having to take something. Savani worked. Mckenna had a, an interesting take on that. He's like, you know, people that want to do it naturally. You know, people want to do it through yoga or meditation. He's like, he goes, I don't ever want to be able to access these places accidentally. Right. Because like there's so titanic, Lee Alien, I want to take something that gets me there. Yeah. And he, he, his take on it was that everybody has this problem with taking a psychedelic that the idea of letting go and taking something, it's just too scary because we always hear about people overdosing, which certainly can happen with a lot of drugs. It doesn't happen with most psychedelics, but people do have adverse reactions.

Speaker 4:          02:09:26       They do. They do like freak out. It can absolutely happen. But his take on the idea of trying to get there without the drug is just s he was like, it's so silly, it's, you know, you can get there instantaneously with the drug, but everybody always wants to do it on their own, you know? Right. There's like, can I can do it naturally, I can achieve those. I've, I've talked to people that are like a dent against psychedelics but want to achieve psychedelic states and they were just like, I can get their natural and like, I don't know if you can,

Speaker 2:          02:09:57       you might be able to get there, but you can't stay there. Like I've done transcendental meditation. I've worked hard. There's been a couple of periods in my life where I worked hard at it and just like any muscle, you get better at it and yeah, if you get good at it and you're into it and you're in the right setting, 2030 minutes in of going over and over again, you, you're gone into that type of state, but your brain immediately goes, Whoa, you're in that state. Come back into your back. You're like, whoa. I was just somewhere for two seconds. So you can get there, but you can't really stay there like you can with some help where you're in it for a few hours.

Speaker 1:          02:10:32       Right. But is that because you're not a practice guru or a practice traveler in those mental worlds? Isn't it possible that there could be a way, like the thing that gives me hope is Kundalini. Cause my friend Denny, uh, who's a, he's a Kunal Indians, Cuna Lien Kundalini instructor, and he's a, he's practiced it for years and he's done a bunch of psychedelics as well. He told me that he's a bit, he's able to achieve those states that he can get to a state of hallucination, like psychedelic hallucination. He can literally get to a state where his mind starts pumping out psychedelic chemicals. He says, not easy though, and you know, but he's been doing it every day for years. Wow. And he can get there. So I think when, when someone, like you says, you know, you, you get there, but then you go, oh my God, I can't believe I'm there.

Speaker 1:          02:11:17       I can totally relate to that because I've been in there in the isolation tank before. There was one time I was in the isolation tank where had this crazy hallucination that I was a in some weird tribe and these people in this tribe, we're talking in a language that was completely foreign but I could understand it and I was even thinking in their language and then I realized it. I was like, oh my God. I'm thinking in that language. Then woke right up and it was over, but I'll never forget that because that moment I was like, it seems so fun like that I could possibly venture into some completely alien civilization, alien to me where I didn't know anything about how they were talking. I didn't know anything but I could understand it and it was almost like this window to what what communication really is that communication.

Speaker 1:          02:12:10       Although languages very and although cultures vary, there's a thing that's going on when you're communicating. Like when you and I are talking right now does that thing that's going on and you can tap into that thing, whatever that thing is, you can tap into that thing and you do it with language. But in my, my crazy hallucination inside the tank, I tapped into it with my mind and I was locked in there and although I understood what they were saying I shouldn't have, it was very, very strange. It was a very, very strange because it wasn't as simple as I was pretending that I could understand what they were saying. Like in my mind they were noises that were coming out of their mouth were there were rough reflecting in my mind. My, I was giving interpretations on those noises and those noises were like, they were there.

Speaker 1:          02:13:01       They were normal for like a normal communication like hey, we've got to go down to the river and we've got to pick up some water and be careful because there's a snake that someone saw that's near this log. It was like that kind of shit, but it was in a completely different, but I didn't know what, you know some weird fucking language though. But it's always the same thing. Like whenever you have something that's really trippy that happens when you're meditating or really trippy that happens when you're dreaming. It's very difficult to stay in that state and not go, oh my God, I'm having a lucid dream and then you wake up. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       it's hard to do all that stuff. One of the interesting things about shrimp fest, when you're doing it with a bunch of Comedians and you forget that you know, you're out in the desert with seven guys and sometimes you're all sort of like spread out on a mountain top. You know what I mean? And sometimes we're together laughing, but sometimes we would like break apart and then you forget everything that's happening and then all of a sudden something hilarious happens. You know? Like at 1.1 guy was like, and we're in the middle of the desert, like phones don't even work out there, but I didn't know where you just here because it's so quiet. It's beautiful, quiet desert and you just hear one guy go, oh shit, I just got a Tinder match.

Speaker 9:          02:14:10       Everybody just started dying in the desert is trying to get laid. Oh exactly. And I mean so far away from civilization. It's so funny like guys and their desire to get laid. I wonder if girls have the same sort of conversations, like constantly trying to figure out how like single girls, how they can get some Dick. It's one of the

Speaker 2:          02:14:32       thing that we're, one of the things that I really, it really annoys me sometimes if if a buddies too horny, it annoys the shit out of me.

Speaker 9:          02:14:41       Worst is if you have a friend where that supersedes everything. Yeah. Like you go out with them and they'll like, they'll like, you're supposed to all be hanging out together and they'll leave, they get a booty call, they'll leave, they get a text hanging out,

Speaker 2:          02:14:52       swiping on Tinder or they're, you know, just, you know,

Speaker 9:          02:14:56       Jamie, this motherfucker heats the entire time you're in Denver. He never put his phone down and I was encouraging my fucking comedy special and he's in the green room. Go over as Tinder matches. I was, I was guilty of encouraging that though because she really looks like this and like get the fuck away from me. Joe, you're shooting, you're special in ten nine Joe, what do you think about this chick? She's missed too much makeup. She's a kindergarten teacher. Oh, it's probably a freak. What is it? The Tinder is like the number one and then there's grinder for the gay folk. Is there one that's like for like people who have not sure anything got in the middle of Adam? No, I'm just fucking, I dunno what I'm looking for. What do you got to offer? What's for sale? I'm not sure what I want for lunch. Once on the menu. Anybody that'll take any, uh huh. Yeah. Yeah. But the desperation, the desperation to, to hook up

Speaker 2:          02:16:00       crazy. And another thing is I can tell the comedians that do stand up comedy just to get girls, guys that didn't get laid in high school and college that figure it out later on that need a second. If I make people laugh and I go on stage, the people that do just for checks.

Speaker 9:          02:16:17       Yeah, that's annoying to you guys. I'm trying really hard to be an actual standard. Right, right, right, right. Exactly. Those guys never, right. Exactly. We have the same bits and once they have bits that work, they

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       stick to those fucking things like glue forever and you're like, where's your new shit man? Never going to see it. Yup. That's a trap, Huh? Yeah. Whenever you, you think about other motivations other than the work itself, the work itself suffers, you know, they said they had, they did this thing, they did the study on motivations and the motivation of doing good work versus the motivation of just trying to make money and they found that the least success was achieved when you had a combination of the both because then you'd be really distracted. The least results. The worst results were, were when someone was like, I want to do good work, but I want to make a lot of money. So how do I do the work, make it good, but try to make a lot of money. Like that is the worst results. And the best results were achieved when they didn't think about the money at all. But concentrated entirely on doing good work. Yeah, no doubt about it.

Speaker 2:          02:17:28       I mean, I was always, you know, the first, uh, three or four years of me doing stand up, moving out here, I came out here with a carry on bag and like $40 cash rolled into a job at a restaurant, you know, but I, I had nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. And had I, when I started standup, dwelled and thought about the fact that I'm crashing on my brother's couch and then, um, you know, then I was renting out a couch in another buddy's living room. You know what I mean? And had I thought about how this isn't normal and the, you know, this sucks. I never would've been able to write another joke, but, and I had to write everything. Everything I've written, I mean everything I wrote back then I wrote while completely broken, struggling. So it's like you got to just ignore it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:12       Isn't it fascinating though that you can only really have that kind of position when you're young, when you're young people accept it, it seems normal, but if you found out that a dude was 40 and he was living on his brother's couch trying to make it as a comedian, you like, oh, you poor piece of shit. That's a different situation for sure. I, you know, really never found what I was looking for until last year, decided to quit my job, had a job at ups, was a good job. I was in sales and then boom, it's poor guys on someone's couch trying to grind it out as a standup comic. Yeah. Can't do it then for sure. It's hard. Even when you're in the later twenties start getting into your thirties and people go, oh, come on man. Right. It might be time to, might be time to bail on this. Yeah. Got To do something. You've got to supplement that income somehow. Yeah. To supplement the income. That's one thing. But the, the idea of the grand struggle of like trying to make it as an actor, like say someone's 45, they decided I'm going to be an actor. Good fucking luck man. Good luck. Right? You're gonna want to start at 45. Jimmy fucking people are out there trying to be actors, right?

Speaker 2:          02:19:17       Most 45 year olds are going to be auditioning against for the same part of a 45 year old had been acting for 25 years. So yeah, they started off as a teenager. I think luck of beating them in your audition. You know,

Speaker 1:          02:19:29       that's one thing that we have that we're so fortunate as a standup comic that you create your own stuff, you deliver your own stuff, you design it, you execute it, you produce it, all of it is done by Tony Hinchcliffe. When you get up there, it's 100% uh, Tony Hinchcliffe production. Whereas like if you are even in a band, you'd have to deal with all the other dudes in the band. And you know, man, when am I going to do my drum solo? And like, this is fucking drum solo. Having to do

Speaker 2:          02:19:57       decide the words of the lyrics and when the, all that stuff, that's why bands can't last at all. All my buddies that were supposed to be huge Rockstar, uh, the couple of friends that I had that are gurus on an electric guitar can play it. If I can just do this, this behind the back, everything and they can play anything. There's Stelling, Youngstown, rotating new band members every one to two years. Hey, tell him, check out my new band. This is a computer box dreams. Hey, check out my new band. This is a Buddha's mystery. Check out my new band. Brick wall extreme. You know, it's like dude, brick wall. We stream. We, yeah, it's like you got to go solo, go solo, get rid of these rooms and yeah, it's tough. Uh, bands crazy. You think of a movie people don't realize every single credit that they see at the end of a movie is somebody that could have ruined the movie. You know, almost everybody has, if they don't pull their weight, if the, you know, whatever the script supervisor sucks, that could ruin a great editors work or vice versa. You know what I mean? Editor can ruin a director, director can ruin a producer. Everybody has to pull their weight. Whereas with standup it's a one man machine.

Speaker 1:          02:21:15       Yeah and it's also like you, you, you travel light, you don't need a bunch of shit that you have to take with you to the airport. Right. You know, you just, it's, it's just so much, it's still hard to do but at least you get like you get undeniable like you, you can get good. Like there's guys that we know that are totally broke that are open miker is that hang around with us. Like they're in the same group. Like when you show up at the comedy clubs and then their shows and there's open Mike shows and there's regular shows is bringer shows. Like everybody interacts with each other. We interact with guys that are just starting out. We interact with guys that had been doing it for years and if you fucking good man, if you get those three minutes and you crush those three minutes, people want to put you on your show and it might take a few years, but a couple years later, you know you're crushing. You do in 10 minutes, you're crushing, you're doing 15 minutes, you're crushing it. You're, you're right, you're, you're bombing. You come back better. You, you crush you, right? You keep doing it, you get undeniable. But if you're in a band, you're never undeniable, right? Because there's some music that you are not interested in. Like WWE, if you are a guy who wants to be a fucking country music guy,

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       you can make music all day. But if you're in the wrong place, if they don't like your kind of stuff like you and you're just not, you can never become undeniable. But if you, you can make people laugh. It's pretty universal. If you're a good comic and you have 300 people there, those 300 people who might have widely different tastes when it comes to what kind of music they like, what kind of food they eat, but you can get all 300 of them. The laugh with something they've never heard before to get all 300 of them to really truly enjoy a song. Very hard. Yeah. The Ah, it's,

Speaker 2:          02:23:04       it's tough working with other people. That's really the thing. Being in a band, it's hard, man. I can't even imagine having to put up with somebody artistic opinion for everything that you're going to end up representing somebody telling you

Speaker 4:          02:23:21       what they think. Yeah. I'm trying to text dom Irrera to see if I can get him to send us that song so we can close with it. What did he do? He wrote a song. Yeah. Does he sing in it? Yeah. And it sounds really professional. Like, like it sounds like a real song that you would here. It's really weird. Really? Yeah. Dom, I rera he looks good, dude. I'm telling you. I didn't even know he was in that realm whatsoever. Did I? It sounds like a joke. He's always been a Beatles fan. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's always been into music, but it's fucking good. Like wow. I was like, Whoa, this is weird. But he's such a good comic. When someone's that good. I would imagine that anything that he does essentially could be great. You know what I mean? I'll wait.

Speaker 4:          02:24:05       I want to do is focus on it. Trying to get him to quit drinking. Hmm. He, uh, he brought it up. I didn't bring it up. He brought it up yesterday. He's like, I drank too much. I wake up every day drunk. What's good? Better than what he said the first time he was on where he was talking about pills all the time and stuff. Remember that? Xanax. Xanax. Yeah. Still on that. But he takes a Xanax in the morning and then, uh, by the time the Xanax wears out, that's when he hits the booze. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:24:31       He's so funny. He's hilarious. It was so fun having you and him on kill Tony together at the ice house. Yeah. We were talking about that.

Speaker 4:          02:24:38       We were talking about how fun that is. Yeah, yeah. That's the one of the most beautiful thing also about comedy is the comradery fucking around with other comedians. You know, like when we're on the road, dude, me mean we do all these gigs together and it's, it's annoying that you got to go to airport to hotel to say, but it's fun. We're laughing. Oh yeah. Which save us Sacramento.

Speaker 2:          02:24:58       Oh yeah. I said a Sacramento is a, is a puppy mill for porn stars. Just where they, they just kick 'em out. These chicks just come out wearing little sweat pants and say juicy on the back. Cute little butts and too little of a shirt strolling through the airport all looking like they're taking the next flight to la just to land directly in the valley to this list. Certain

Speaker 4:          02:25:23       when like

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       do you go to a Burbank if you leave Burbank to Vegas, like would you can play that game. Which one's a stripper? Right? You could play that game. Which girls are going to the rhino. It's like there's a lot of gals that like live in La and go to Vegas and make a shit ton of money there over the weekend and then fly back to La and I'm not hating, I'm not mad at him. Right. But it's fun to pick them out. Yeah. And it's pretty easy to, they always wear a troopy sweatpants. Like they're playing it down like we're not supposed to notice. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. They don't wear like sexy clothes. Probably so tired. Yeah. That dude's fucking stand at their box. Right. Well all the ugly girls, all the ugly girls, they try to dress up and the those ones try to dress down, but it's too obvious cause they try too hard to dress down.

Speaker 3:          02:26:10       I'm just wearing a, you know, just wearing a hoodie and a pair of sweatpants. Yeah. It's important. They're there to giving up their hand. Right. But sweat pants are hot on a girl. Super Cute. And you see that little butt flap, you know, or the cloth like sorta curls up right underneath the butt cheeks. Oh. Karolin sweatpants is so much better than a hot chicken jeans. You know what I mean? I mean, I'm saying both hot checks, but I'm saying I'd rather, I'd prefer hot chicken sweatpants then genes cause it's not the same. You can't feel that. Well if you grab a girl's ass and

Speaker 4:          02:26:40       pants, it feels like you're grabbing a girl's ass where if you grab a girl's ass and tight jeans, it's like you are holding on to something that's restrained. Right. You know, it's like, like a straight jacket. Yeah. Like you got a straight jacket on your posting. Thick, thick canvas. Straight jacket that you've stubbed your fucking box into. Yeah. You know your, your legs or skin tight like girls never wear like, like these kinds of genes like loose jeans. Nobody wears those. Right? They wear jeans where they can barely walk. Yeah. They're just shoved into them. Yeah. How often you see a girl with baggy jeans? It's super rare.

Speaker 3:          02:27:18       I don't know. When is the last time I saw Esther pivot ski? I haven't heard a fucking peep about her. What's going on with Little Leicester? Last time marriage. She was working up in Nicole Richie. She's doing a lot of MTV stuff. Isn't that right? Yeah. Tony talks are more probably, what is she doing? Uh, she's, uh, she just made a pilot, uh, and, um, she's, uh, she's working it, just doing her thing, doing spots at the store.

Speaker 7:          02:27:47       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:27:47       What's the big pause and look down, look up, pause, look down, look up. Just admiring this glowing rock. There's some, uh, there's a, uh, uh, thing that I tweeted earlier today that, uh, in one of its kind study in international team of neuroscientists and robotic engineers have demonstrated the viability of direct brain to brain communication and humans and recently published and, uh, some, some uh, study in p l o s one. Um, it's the novel findings describe a successful transmission of information via the Internet, but between the intacs scalps of two human subjects located 5,000 miles apart.

Speaker 12:         02:28:33       Whoa. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:28:34       The one to find out if one could communicate directly between two people by reading out the brain activity from one person and injecting brain activity into the second person and to do so across great physical distances by leveraging existing communication pathways. That's fucking nuts, man.

Speaker 12:         02:28:53       Whoa.

Speaker 4:          02:28:55       So what they're essentially saying is through the Internet there's sending information directly from brain to brain. So what we were talking about earlier, yeah, that's real. Like there they are literally going to be able to directly transmit like I'm going to be able to look at you and send you a message. I won't even be able to say I have to say anything. I'll send you a message and that message is going to go to your brain. Like I'll have an idea like check out this mother fucker is. It's going to show up in your brain. Check out. This motherfucker knew like exactly or not even going to have control over over thinking a hundred years from now they're just going to create tools. Who are they though? They are going to be subject to the same shit that we're subject to. Like this idea that there's a giant club ball of people that are going to be able to control this.

Speaker 4:          02:29:41       That might be the most ridiculous aspect of conspiracy theories. One of the most ridiculous aspect key thing really happened. You said that and that's why I'm wondering murder dude. They murdered a bunch of people. That's a lack of communication. They killed people. I mean, this is in the nineties this is pre internet that all this shit went down. Right? I mean it was, the Internet is essentially what's blowing back against them right now. Yeah, but that's more like a fucking game of Thrones type scenario, right. Than it is someone not being able to control information software or information technology like this. You know, this is a completely different sort of a thing. I just wonder, I wonder what we're going to be like a thousand years from now, we're going to be completely unrecognizable. The concept of what life is going to be unrecognizable and the idea of privacy is going to be hilarious. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:30:36       yeah. It's going to be hilarious. Flooded. There's no privacy stop. We're the last people to experience privacy until the, until something happens. Until there's some sort of a crash, like a civilization crash, like asteroidal impacts super volcano, massive earthquake, some power shut down or things go back to normal. We're going to be the last people that experienced privacy, like real true privacy. Yeah. Have you ever gone somewhere where you got no cell phone signal and like stayed there for days? Yeah. Yeah. Where Joshua tree, but he can get phones out there and get cell phones out there. Not, not with sprint. You can't, is that true? Do you guys with ATNT making calls? Did you get jealous? Same thing. It's same thing at the comedy store. My phone barely works there. Yeah, but that's cause the comedy store is a vortex. Yeah. There's something going on that you could have full fucking four bars when you drive up that high at parking lot and then you look at your phone once you step into the fucking hollowed walls. So true. It is so true. Is it the lead parking lot? Parking lot, please. There's nothing. Did you know that Paul is trying to get people to stop smoking pot there?

Speaker 2:          02:31:50       I heard a rumor of this. I haven't seen it directly. I actually talked to Paula yesterday for a moment in the parking lot. I'm pretty sure I was smoking pot while talking to them.

Speaker 4:          02:32:03       Um, you know, he's Paulie, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's, he's a character man. Indeed. Sort of like Donald Duck or yeah. Yeah. Like the undertaker. Are they really going to try to do that? Try to get people to stop smoking pot of the comedy club.

Speaker 2:          02:32:23       Absolutely impossible. That is something that could never be done at the comedy store at the last thing they want is their entire uh, line up out on the sidewalk smoking pot because they're not allowed sees, does smoke pot wherever they are.

Speaker 4:          02:32:39       Lousy how layer? Yes. Like a smoking lounge like they do at the airport.

Speaker 2:          02:32:43       They do have a smoking lunch at the comedy store. It's called everywhere around the comedy

Speaker 4:          02:32:47       store and inside of it. But they, maybe they should have like a look. You have to have like a card. You Swipe it and you have a little membership. You go in to the hotbox buddies in their barbecued, you go in there like if you ever pass those smoking things, especially in Europe, like you don't realize how much people smoke in other countries. Holy Shit. Like I was in Germany. I took these photos of it cause it, it didn't seem real and it had all these warnings on it. It's like this smoking station where you could go into this literally this glass box and they created at the airport. He's people went and it was filled with smoke. It was so bizarre. Like we stopped, it was me and Eddie Bravo. We stopped and we, uh, we looked at it, we were like, look in there. This is crazy. Like these fucking people are, they're all like surrounding themselves with each other's smoke and they just sit in there.

Speaker 2:          02:33:37       It was a really creepy, I remember being at the Denver airport or somewhere, some airport a few years ago and I at a layover and I saw one of those and I went inside and it was exactly like the waiting room from beetle juice. Like all these creepy like people with like something missing or like something weird and they're just slowly smoking is awful. Remember that waiting room from beetle juice for the guy sprinkles dust on the guys head and it shrinks. Beetle juice holds up by the way. Doesn't go. God Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton's best work. Tim Burton's best work, perhaps Danny Elfman's. Best word.

Speaker 4:          02:34:13       Well, Michael Keaton's best work. Um, and you've seen Batman and this is right. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 9:          02:34:18       I'll send Tim Burton. I mean, they went into that post beetle juice, two different characters, by the way. I mean like the, you know, the both, both amazing works of art in two different takes from Michael Keaton. You know, two was the Michael Keaton one where he played a dude. It was like, there's a hundred of them. It's so funny. Is it? Oh, it's so fun. Good. Oh yeah. What about, um, the other one, Johnny dangerously? Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I've seen that though. Him and Joe Piscopo. I've heard good things about it, but I don't think, but I'll hook once. Michael Keaton's lawn. I read a great interview about him yesterday. He lives in Montana now, hunts every day. Has Dogs, goes to diners, you know, just lives a normal, cool life. And people just sort of like, oh, nice to meet you, Mr Kayden Yang. Glad that you live in the neighborhood. And he lives like this low profile, but he hunts every day and writes and is always on the phone and he's looking for the next gig but doesn't want to do any it take and just anything cause you still act. Oh yeah. Huh. When he finds the thing that he's interested in, I haven't seen him in anything in a long time. You know, it's weird when you see a guy like that and they, they kind of fade out a little bit. Yeah. Well he's Sorta Chelan. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure he's a,

Speaker 13:         02:35:34       yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:35:35       I'm pretty sure he likes living the mellow life showing us. Brian,

Speaker 13:         02:35:42       what is that?

Speaker 9:          02:35:44       That's Michael Keaton, the movie. Yeah. That's what I read is it say human foibles. What human foibles give Birdman? It's super human wing. Foibles is a weird word to use. You ever had anybody use it in a conversation? I know what that means and I'm a wordsmith and the writers need to be awards for the don't know what foibles means. I have no idea. I'm an honest word. Smith foibles is a minor weakness or eccentricity in someone's character. They have to tolerate each other's foibles.

Speaker 13:         02:36:15       Huh?

Speaker 8:          02:36:17       Jay, you don't remember this part and uh, John that move, we were just talking about your testicles in you

Speaker 9:          02:36:22       and now I don't remember. I don't remember Johnny dangerously that much. It was really kind of remember that now that I'm seeing it.

Speaker 8:          02:36:28       Yeah. It's just like guys walking around with huge balls.

Speaker 14:         02:36:31       It's guys who are like, Oh yeah,

Speaker 9:          02:36:38       this guys whose balls grow too big. So the idea. Yeah, I think so. That is real man. You ever seen those poor folks where their ball swell up to the size of, they've had them on television before. He's got a weird nut ball. One Ball. Does he ever gone to the doctor about his ball mentions have rampant cancers ignoring it?

Speaker 8:          02:36:59       I remember that video weight on the end of June clam and it showed a, and they had had like skittles in it. It looked like a bunch of like weird.

Speaker 9:          02:37:05       No I don't, I don't have really any intense recollections of his balls. It was a weird time period. You're saying are he's balls look like they had skittles.

Speaker 8:          02:37:13       Yeah. If you look at Geo clean,

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       did you taste the rainbow? The Rainbow?

Speaker 1:          02:37:20       He couldn't help himself help himself. Yeah, there's a, um, I think he's in Michigan. Yeah. Who? Michael Hayden Montana. Is it Montana?

Speaker 2:          02:37:32       Yeah, I read the yoga is amazing. Interview and Esquire. Michael Keaton. I mean, it's crazy. I couldn't believe how good it was. So read it yesterday. Really? Ah, so good. This guy's living a cool life man, and he's just a cool dude. This journalist, you know, explains it. Like when I got the assignment, here's what happened, and I talked to Michael Keaton's manager and here's what he told me I should look into before I meet him. Next thing you know, I'm on a plane and Michael Keaton's calling me at 6:30 AM like, I hope it's not too early. I'll meet you for lunch. Bobby Bell, like Michael Keaton is just the man pretty much, you know,

Speaker 1:          02:38:08       you're a big Fan, huh?

Speaker 2:          02:38:09       Come on in. If anybody born in 1984, if you don't like Michael Keaton, then you know what?

Speaker 1:          02:38:15       Okay,

Speaker 2:          02:38:16       get out of the world. Go. Go for it. Go to the ocean and just swim the direction, not of land, just keep swimming until you're nothing. If you, if you're anti Michael Keaton, you're anti everything that's good beetle juice. The Best Batman multiplicity. Is that a monster?

Speaker 1:          02:38:37       What does it mean? That movie he played, uh, there was him and uh, it was a couple that was renting him and apartment and uh, he didn't want to leave remembering he was like some crazy scammer. It was like a San Francisco is about San Francisco because San Francisco has like insane real estate. Remember that? Yeah, I'll find it. He um, yeah, it was like, I forget the name of it, but I think it was with a dude from vision quest to, did you ever see that movie vision quest or the original vision quest? The rest of the movie? Yeah. Matthew Modine. Yeah. Remember she didn't think he was in that movie. Wow. Night shift. No. No. Um, [inaudible] I find that the squeeze, it was like Pacific something or another Pacific Heights. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. That was a good fucking movie. He's been reliable. He was in Noah's Ark, the new beginning.

Speaker 1:          02:39:31       He was a voice of Noah. What kind of a piece of shit was that movie? Is that the one we watched? No, we tried to watch. You should say we tried to watch the new Noah movie with Russell Crowe. Holy Shit. Shit was that bad. And he only watched part of what was bad. You didn't want you gave up? Yeah, we all gave up Jamie game up too. But I hung in there. I fucking took more blows and bolts. You I tapped. It was gross. It was so bad. And then it got to like sum, it became, at first it was like, there was like monsters and stuff like rock monsters and bad people and it was, it was so like predictable and goofy. But then when I got on the boat and

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       when they were dealing with the flood, then it became like this weird, you know, sort of like when walking dead got all about people, you know, and everybody got kind of bummed out. It's just like interpersonal shit between people. Yeah. That's what it is. On this stupid boat with Noah.

Speaker 2:          02:40:28       You would think this story would have a better arc, but

Speaker 4:          02:40:34       you send them a bit and help yourself. Help yourself. I can't. So what's new and Tony Hinchcliffe slide. What's cracking? We got going on.

Speaker 2:          02:40:43       Fun Man. Just did it. Did a lot of touring with you. I'm really excited about some little things coming up. A little few writing projects that I already sort of pitched and it's a waiting for the good word for that, but really I'm most excited about kill Tony. I care about it a lot and I love it. It should be a TV show. I just love it. We're having so much fun. Every Monday, the last 10 episodes have been our best episodes. It's running like a machine. It's the room is packed. Every Monday the there's buzz. I feel like it's just fun and cool and it's a

Speaker 4:          02:41:17       bringing it to Columbus, Ohio to, yeah. Are you guys going to do it live? Yeah. Now when you do it live, you can use local comics. Yeah. How many comics do you have in Columbus? A lot. Yeah. I'm on me. When I used to do open mic there, there was at least 50 comics that would sit there and all. We would all have to audition in front of other comics just to do three minutes. No Shit. 50. Yeah, there was a lot back then. Wow. I had no idea.

Speaker 2:          02:41:41       So many people uh, you know, asks, I get a tweet a day at least. Hey, bring it to Vancouver. How are you, how do you pick, like if for folks who don't know how the show works, everybody goes up and does a minute. How many comics do you have on our show? A, well usually about 20 to 30 sign up and usually about 12 to 15 get on and you decide how many go on, how just it just depends. See the part that's the part of the format that's a little bit more loose is how long we spend on each person is totally dependent on how we feel with them up there. You know, for folks who don't all the person that was a minute and then the professional comics goof on them. Oh, we talked to them about, and maybe maybe we try to coax them into writing a new bit by asking them questions about their life, where they're from, Bobby ba or, or font or goof on them. Right. We had a guy wearing a, what looked like cum stain shorts on first, first day. He's like, I came here all the way from Tuscaloosa, Alabama to do my first set of stay in bed and he's like wearing these terrible shorts. And of course I'm going to light him up. He probably lives in silver lake and its characters. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:42:44       I'm working on is probably totally fake. Yeah. It's probably a hipster. Right? It's just fucking with you just decided to like make an art piece out of doing like really bad obvious standup.

Speaker 2:          02:42:54       We used to make fun of people a lot harder. Really? Yeah. What changed? Death threats? No violence itself. No, I think the show is a little bit cooler and more positive and I found something that I found out through the show because, you know, I like making fun of people and roasting. It's definitely a part of my, uh, whatever toolbox. But, uh, I think the show organically grew. I think it's more satisfying to give to, for somebody to come up with something that's genuinely funny and only they can do and try to figure out what that is and a short allotted amount of time. It's like watching a baby, being born like a little comedy baby, like if you know, whatever the guys in Indian guy from whatever, and it turns out to be gay. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:43:42       We just had Sinbad also on recently and Jeff Garlin, which was, you guys did that at the comedy store, right? Yeah. Nice. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:43:49       we did. We've done most of the episodes out of there every Monday eight o'clock

Speaker 1:          02:43:55       comedy store and if anybody wants to sign up how far in advance they have to get there that day, that day. Yup. Just show up. Do it. Just show up. That's the same way with open Mike there. Right. And still, Yup. It's one of the few places like that I like, um, the laugh factory sign up, but you have to wait in line and then you're waiting in line for like the next week, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just so crazy. Yeah. Let's just torture people are going to work for free for you, right? Yeah. Well the idea is like to make them work hard for some reason. Yes. Make them earn it. Yeah. I don't, I don't get it. They could just as easily have them go up that day. And why do you have to have them wait in line, you know, make them sign up and then pick from the people there.

Speaker 2:          02:44:36       It's not the same reason. The laugh factory does everything that they do because they think a line outside of their place makes them look busy. That's how they do it. That's why they don't, they'd rather not sell drinks on a patio or an a back bar and upstairs or in anything. They'd rather make it look like it's busy by putting a little line around the front. That's their whole trek. Yeah. Oh yeah. We got there. So there's something happening. Look, there's people waiting on a sidewalk. You know, those are young comic standing in 95 degree heat for no reason. For five hours a day. Literally for hours and hours. People will get there.

Speaker 1:          02:45:11       Yeah, I've passed by there. Uh, I did Don [inaudible] podcast and it was during the day and there was a bunch of people that were there also. Actually Eliza as podcasts I did out of there recently during the day was a bunch of people. They're just sitting there for no fucking reason and they have to stay there, which is like insuring someone that they can't make a living. Right? Like you don't require anything of that. I'm, why are you making them stay there? Right. How hard is it? Jesus. Jamie Masada. There's two days in a row. We've been talking shit about you. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:45:38       give a mile. It's the first 15 people or whatever. They get there, but they'll make them wait all day. Body

Speaker 1:          02:45:43       is very important by the, we have to get them to sit in the, we have system we teach, we teach them. They do good job. They do what we tell them on the podcast. Joe? Nope, I did a podcast with him and Dom Arrera if you want to listen to it. I love Jamie. Don't get me wrong. I do love the guy and the guy he is responsible for keeping open. One of the top clubs in the country in that club is one of the best clubs in La, which makes it one of the best clubs in the country. Are you making that face? Which I'm sorry.

Speaker 9:          02:46:12       No, no, I don't like it. You don't like it?

Speaker 2:          02:46:15       I don't think the color is yellow and blue and orange belong anywhere near

Speaker 9:          02:46:19       cause you're a dark man with a dark soul. You Damn right baby. That's why you should be dressed in gold, dancing around going, hey andro take a streak as my brows. So silly. You're right though. To something about comedy, like dark, dark seems to be like, yeah, give me a low ceiling pitch. Black, dark. Just a mic and a mic. Stand. A stool. That's all I fucking want. Red Kurt. Speaking of which you're going to be at the comedy works, you're going to get a date there to headline after you a work there with him. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. I was so happy I picked that place. She's, that's the spot. Yeah. Wendy's awesome. She really is. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       But that, that club is also like the perfect setup. Like literally the perfect setup for totally

Speaker 2:          02:46:58       hanging out with her was really interesting because uh, you know, I, I never really got to hang with Mitzi and you know, I know it's two different people and everything, but the amazing maternal energy that I felt from her and like love of standup comedy made me feel like I sort of got it from like being a comedy store guy, but in a post Mitzi era. Like it was amazing to get to hang with powerful comedy woman like that.

Speaker 1:          02:47:30       Yeah. She's awesome. Yeah. There's only a few people like that in the country that are responsible for scenes. You know, like the, the comedy scenes in cities can be directly dependent upon like a single club sometimes. Like cap city is like a big one for Austin. Right. That's another place we worked at recently that that's like the hub. That's the big spot in Austin that is the big club in Austin, Texas and there's like a few of those all across the country. It's a kind of amazing that they haven't like tried to move in with an Improv in Austin. Like how, how's the Improv missed on Austin, Texas? You mean they have one in Houston but it doesn't, it's kind of an a sketch neighborhood apparently, but there's no more other, like there's no more independent club in Houston anymore. They used to be the last stop, which is like the one of the greatest of all time.

Speaker 1:          02:48:19       And that club, the laugh stoppers responsible for Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, even Janeane Garofalo I think did a lot of her early stuff out of, uh, out of the last stop. It was just a completely different kind of club. And that one club like defined that whole town's comedy scene, Houston at one point in time, it was like one of the best comedy scenes in the country. Like some of the best up and coming young talent was coming out of Houston was weird. But that club goes under that one club goes under and then the whole thing just kind of like drifts off. It's hard. It's hard to keep a scene. So when you find someone like Wendy, you gotta appreciate the fuck out of them. Yeah, and I loved that. You know what I mean? I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:49:02       any, anybody who had seen me talking a bunch of crazy dark, evil stuff before you and go, hey, you're cool. You want to do a weekend here? Like it's like, wow,

Speaker 1:          02:49:13       we're talking about you're funny.

Speaker 2:          02:49:15       Yeah. But you know, everybody's always looking for an excuse. Why to not, even though it's funny, it's like if everybody is always like, ah, you know? Yeah. So dark. You know? Why don't you, why don't you do some more

Speaker 1:          02:49:27       saying so dark? You're just funny, man. You know it's not, it's not like it's disgusting or something ridiculous. Like, do you, you, you looking down on your own act or something? Like what he'd done like so dark, so dark. I just can not that dark.

Speaker 2:          02:49:40       Well, I always get told, oh, people's theories on why this and why that,

Speaker 1:          02:49:46       I don't know why things aren't happening. Right. What are you talking to? Agents. Managers. Yeah. Those, those people. You shouldn't, you shouldn't talk to them.

Speaker 2:          02:49:54       You know what? My manager told me the other day, please tell me. He goes, you need to, you need to not be so much of a wrestling villain. Like you're like, you're like a pro wrestling villain and I don't think that goes well with standup comedy. Nobody's ever done that before. And I go, Gee, here,

Speaker 9:          02:50:07       you just said, I go, nobody's ever done that before. You just said it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:12       He's an idiot. You got a new one, your manager. I can't, I can't tell someone that too much of an anything. He doesn't have any idea why you're funny. No one has any idea why you're funny other than, you know, it sounds ridiculous, but you're absolutely right. The only people that can help you or other pro comics that work with you that kind of see things, they will. Maybe if you're this or maybe if you're that, and then you take it into consideration and knowing it's coming from someone who actually knows what they're talking about, but someone who's never done stand up trying to tell you what does or does not make you funny. They can't do it. They can't do it. It's just a wasted conversation, buddy. You should be generation x guy. Go on stage. Everything come out of your mouth is about generation X. Jamie Masada actually said that to one of my friends.

Speaker 2:          02:50:56       You know what Jamie told me? I've told you this right? I have the best one ever. Yes, please. You still have to do the, Oh, you would wait for hours to do the open mic and then you go in everybody if you willing to do that, if you stick around after the open mic, you can go up to Jamie and eaten the owner of the land victory. Jamie will give you his advice on your career. What he said. Yeah Buddy Buddy. Very funny. You wear a cowboy hat. Do you make it to come back with cowboy hat? They put you on stage.
