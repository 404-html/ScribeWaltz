Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I don't even think they're nuclear bombs work. It's all posturing probably, right? Yeah. Do Do, do Abby Martin were like, wow, you have a doom shirt on. Powerful street cred with the kids. They're going back to the Wolfenstein doom days. Old School id software. Hell, he had that game. That game was awesome. I missed him or due to the new ones are pretty bad movie. I never saw it. I did. It was terrible. Was it the first person shooters so bad? No, no, no. There was a. There was a first person shooter movie like something Harry or something like that. Hardcore hardcore. Henry. Henry and Henry. Was it good? That was nuts. It really just felt like you're watching a video game the whole time. It was absolutely insane. What was it? Good. I don't know if it was just very entertaining. Well, there is. Yeah, that's right. The Rock. When he had hair. Wow. That's right. Old School guy. That was a terrible movie was so dumb. Why does it look like that? I remember doing being super red and orange and this is blue. Come on. Come on. Who the hell's going on? Why is he listed first? Because nobody knew who the raclette Karl Urban. Exactly. That's how old that movie was. What else is Karl? Urban Bennon Dude, I just had a twitter argument with Chelsea Clinton.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       It's like these people don't understand, never respond to someone who's like way less than a year, you know, she like, she, like, I called her, I basically, I called her parents were criminals and she was like, yeah, you know, I should have listened more during, during the 2003 Iraq war today, antiwar activist. But she initially called people who were protesting the Afghanistan war and like the AUMF anti American. So she was like, yeah, because there was a story that came out that said Chelsea Clinton actually with like American flags and all these things like went and disrupted an antiwar protest after nine slash 11. Yeah, like a group of Patriots and in probably 22 or something. I mean maybe, maybe younger. So then people were calling her out and being like, you know, like mother, like daughter, because there's stories of Hillary Clinton, like really working hard to quell the protest, the Vietnam war protests on, on campus and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       As the president of the Republican Young Republicans Club. She was the president really just pre or post Kent state this. Ooh, good question. Really good question. I don't know it was when the whole that it'd be hard to defend it after that. Right after people are shot. But yeah. So Chelsea actually responded to me. I was floored because I was like, your dad killed 500,000 babies in Iraq with the sanctions and your mom voted for the Iraq war. I was like, why don't you protest them? And she was like, you know, it was like what she just said. She was like, you know, I wasn't really. She was, I don't think that people protesting the Afghanistan war, anti American. She was like, you know, 140 characters limiting. I was like, do you see that? I just called your parents were criminals

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       and you're actually responding whatever, whatever WTF. Just put the blinders on. Oh my God. And then she was like, I was talking about the Americans who denounce, like you know that America is an imperialist warmonger. I was like, it is the countries in an imperialist war mongering country that's killed millions of people use cert, the democratic processes of dozens of countries and the world actually thinks that America is the number one threat to global peace. So I actually agree with the Americans. You denounce Chelsea. It was nuts. So that was a highlight of the day. Yeah, that's not a good look for her. No, she should probably stay off twitter for a few years. It's like, dude, just just step back. I mean, you sound awful. I know that you're trying to get in the public spotlight in and get that momentum behind you. I mean, people are already talking about her running in 20 slash 20 Michelle Obama, Chelsea Clinton together.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       The two of them together that Jay. Can you imagine? Whoa. That would be hilarious. What's the problem is as soon as you engage with someone that's calling anyone who is absolutely responsible for death, a war criminal, as soon as you engage, it's like, well, then you have to define what do you think is a war criminal? Like what's okay for you? Is it okay if 10,000 babies? Now he said, I mean like you could kind of call any president ever a war criminal except for maybe Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter gets slippery because he was really a peaceful man and a really weird situation and I think a lot of people capitalized on that weakness, including Ronald Reagan, which is the reason why the hostages in Iran weren't even released until after Reagan took office and nuts. That's a crazy story. It's a crazy story because they literally kept those people prisoner and negotiated with their release based on Ronald Reagan winning the election to make them look better.

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       Those people were prisoner longer because of Reagan, like they could have just gotten them out in a total, nonpartisan way. They could've said, hey, these are Americans. Let's get them home like fuck out of there. They wanted to move those chips around the board. Let's move this, let's move these pieces. It was, it was almost as good a that Chelsea Clinton recognition as when John Mccain tweeted a segment that I did about him on breaking the set, which was like the most scathing segment, calling him as senile crazy war criminal like sadistic fuck. And he like tweeted it out and he was like, thanks Vlad. Vladimir Vladimir Putin. If lad continues his attacks against me and tweeted out to like is, that's really what he said. Yeah. Now you don't. You didn't have anybody telling you what to do. No, but God can. You heard about all the DNI report, that intelligence report that basically claimed that I, along with another show cost Hillary Clinton the election. I mean this intelligence report came out after months and months. Everyone's waiting with baited breath thinking, okay, we're finally going to get evidence that Russia hacked the election, right? This claim that Russia hacked the election and then they come out with this report. Half of it was just bashing our tea and it named my shows

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       specifically, and it said the show covered fracking, occupy Wall Street, um, government greed, Hillary Clinton's war crimes. It's like, and they basically just insinuated that these things are what cost Hillary Clinton the election, a show that had gone off the air two years before. It's nuts, but people are terrified of ridiculous shit. The intelligence community, how do they do that? Then how could they do that if you're showing off the year, two years before the previous criticism? Yeah. They said that that was when like Russia had begun to foment like all this descent and um, and trying to discredit American democracy. Like that's when Russia really like began the propaganda campaign was when my show, I was like the vector. I was like this, this person that was put in there and started to unravel democracy. It's crazy. It's an enormous amount of power, but you didn't know yet.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       But what's even crazier about it is it's like, yeah, of course our t is pro Russian. It's fucking called Russia today. Of course they're going to cover Putin in a positive light. The crazy thing is that the intelligence report essentially said that covering real issues like covering greed and fracking are our Russian propaganda talking points and that was really bad because you're. You're calling reality propaganda like people are living in poverty in this country, half the countries and poor living paycheck to paycheck, so you can't call like covering that reality propaganda. Russian propaganda. That's fucking reality is slippery. They're working for something like Rt. If they are going to view poutine in a positive light but they are going to criticize clinton like it is. He does get a lIttle slip. Are you happy you're not there anymore? I am happy that I'm doing the reporting that I'm doing or just like more just on the ground investigation.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Like since I last saw you, I've been to palestine. Like now I finally like really have a sense of these issues that I was covering from the studio and and feel like I know them more, you know, after going and talking to the people in the communities and stuff like that. So the, the journalism is definitely much better. I don't have any boss, I'm just doing my own things. And you totally didn't know. Well, I'm working for telos sore. So it's like a latin american state funded media. Now, just to close to soros, he's the one that makes the weed stronger. Did you read that? Controls everything. I chose the same as he's making the weed stronger. Can I ask you a question? What one does a billionaire become a globalist? Because why is not? Why is rex tillerson not a globalist, the exxon mobil ceo? Like one question that this whole thing about like soros is this globalist and all these people are against the globalist yet trump, it's totally fine to have rex tillerson and all these goldman sachs bankers and the government and why are they not globalists capital move across the left wing. Democrats with money are globalists. What does that mean? Trump's in power. So that's how it works. So if trump wasn't in power, then it would be rupert murdoch. So it'd be the one. He'd be the evil bandit. It's nuts. It's nuts. I mean, yes. Soros is

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       a horrible person who's done a ton of crazy shit, but like so as rex tillerson, so are all these people, you know, betsy devoss is his psychotic. These people are christian fundamentalists who have used trump as like the trojan horse to get into power. These people have been vying for power for the last 30 years. These christian evangelicals, mike pence, betsy devoss, you know betsy devoss, his brothers. Eric prince, right? The blackwater guy. Yeah. That's her brother. That's her brother. Who is a divorce. Her married name? Yeah. What is her deal again? So she, her and her, I think her husband's names dick, but um, she married into this like education privatization scheme where it's like a super right wing religious extremist education privatization thing where they're trying to like get vouchers for creationism and all these things like private schooling that teaches creationism. And so they funneled the betsy devoss like family. Um, I forget what the organization's called, but they've funneled millions and millions of dollars into this sCam. I'm meanwhile her brother, Eric Prince. You know what he's been doing. I mean, he's now working for like Qatar, Saudi Arabia,

Speaker 4:          00:10:05       I think it's United Arab Emirates and I think he literally, when arab spring broke out, he took his whole business over there was like, listen, there's a way to prevent those war. So tHey have like a private militant group over there or rather a mercenary group over there that's kind of running their, their army.

Speaker 3:          00:10:27       It's so crazy. It's like this family is working together to create these like obedient christianized soldier children who are growing up in schools thinking that, you know, the kingdom and the messiah gonna come. I mean it's nuts. And, and, and when she was in the confirmation hearing, of course she was the only one that actually wasn't confirmed in mike pence had to do the tiebreaker because everyone was like, she's the most unqualified person. She cAn't spell. She's like a total moron. I'm, why is she even like in the running here? And she lied multiple times in the hearing. She was like, yeah, no, that was a clerical error when it said that I was vice president or on the board of this organization, which is this right wing extremist hate mongering organization that's funneled millions of dollars to knock down all the the gay marriage propositions and all these states and stuff like that. So she lied and said she wasn't on the board, but really when you look at the paperwork, she was on the board for like 10 years or something. I mean, how could a clerical error happened? Not that long. So it's sick. These people are sick. Mike pence is a disgusting person who he fought for conversion therapy for gay people.

Speaker 4:          00:11:27       Those people are on. What does this say? Refused to agree with democrat, that schools are no place for guns, citing one school that needs one to protect she grizzly grizzlies bears. She really said this. First of all, grizzly bears are rarely predatory towards people and especially not in schools that don't go to school. All. I don't think that's ever happened. Bedside and you know what you could do, you could just shut the door and then the kids cannot get in the school and won't try. Unbelievable. The kids guns that didn't. Someone say like the. The solution is sandy hook is giving the children. The teachers don't think that it would work either. I mean it wouldn't be the worst idea to have some military presence in a place that where people you really feel that they're threatened, but the question is like, why are they threatened?

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       LIke you have a fucking mentally ill person who has access to guns. The real issue is keeping track of mentally ill people I would imagine, and also down that mentally ill thing. Like wasn't that a vettIng thing that I think the nra actually shut down that we. That mentally ill people can actually still purchase firearms. Am I wrong about that? That's a good question. I think in terms of like what is the medication they're on because finds mental illness. Yeah. Well the federal government was trying to deny licenses to people that have marijuana, medical marijuana prescriptions. They were trying to deny them handgun licenses. Who were firearms license. Hilarious. It's crazy because you could be on oxycontIn and all sorts of disassociative drugs, ssri which are almost entirely connected to school shootings and mass shootings. If you look at mass shootings, the vast majority of them either were on psych meds or have been on psych meds, were off psych meds and of course then the argument, the real scientific argument is that they had not necessarily the cause, you know, the causation and correlation are not necessarily connected.

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       So no one knows exactly why those people do that. But if you've ever talked to someone who was on zoloft or anything, one of the problems is there's a disassociation with reality and the that nothing bothers you anymore. Like I had a friend who was on it and she was telling me, she's like, I could come home and my house could be on fire and I'd be like, oh, my house is on fire. She's like the dog burning. She wanted to write a book called. I lost a year of my life because she, she literally like nothing mattered. Everything was gray and black and white and there was no color and it was just weird. She was like, my whole life just happened in a year, and then I got off of them and then I was like, oh, okay. Now I'm a person again. Like, what the fuck happened to me for a year?

Speaker 4:          00:14:20       That's horrible. Here's the shit out of me. How many people they just throw on those goddamn things and I know that some people are, that they benefit from them. I've had friends that have benefit from them. I know there's a positive, but I, I gotta think there's too many people that are going right to them and not exercising, not changing their diet, not trying to meditate, not trying to seek some sort of a positive avenue for their, their life and their energy and see if that has any effect on their depression. It just scares the shit out of me. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's crazy. I mean, how crazy is this jeff? Sessions like taking us back to regional madness. He wants to just say no again. He wants to, he wants to restart. Just say, no, this guy's nuts. He's oLd as fuck. That's a part of the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:15:08       And along with that guy, dick and he. Any guys still named dick? What's her name? Just husband. Oh yeah. DIck device. If you're sold that, your fucking parents called you dick silver. Yeah. the last dick that I know his dick tracy, which is like, you know an old nicole. Yeah. You're so old that the name dick wasn't referred to. It wasn't a dick back then. Right? That's a fucking old. You are so crazy that it's time to not be in charge of drug policy. There's no way you're thinking clear. There's no way he said it. He said no. Good people smoke weed. No good people smoke marijuana. That's just not true, jeff. Yeah. That's not true. We're good people. I'm a nice person. Were very good and pay my taxes. You fuck? Yeah. What else did I just read that just they're racist origins of making weed illegal obviously tweeted something like that a couPle of days ago about the racist origins.

Speaker 4:          00:15:57       It was a rolling stone piece and the racist origins with the drug. It was entireLy designed during the nixon administration. This, the whole schedule one designation for marijuana, cocaine or cocaine, cocaine has medical use, believe it or not, scheduled to, but marijuana, mushrooms, all these different psychedelic drugs. I believe. So. I'm pretty sure bizarre medical use of cocaine. Um, I think heroin as well check that jamie just in case. But there is a medical use for cocaine. There's a medical use for heroin, opiates, things along those lines. So I think they have different designations because of that because they still refuse to admit there's a medical use for marijuana despite all the millions of people using it for positive, including kids wIth epilepsy. I mean it's a believable in autism. I have a good friend who has a kid that had severe seizures and there was nothing they could do about it until they started giving him.

Speaker 4:          00:16:53       They would give him hash in like a piece of melon, you know, like, and all the sudden gone like all seizures and he's more communicative. He's more responsive. He's got pretty severe cognitive issues. Autism and uh, and also the seizures. It's like, it's pretty severe. And the only thing that helps them as medical marijuana. Yeah. Yeah. For me, I just get high. I just don't be clear folks. I mean, don't be confused. I mean I, I'm, I'm pro all those things. Yeah. It was basically a knee operation was okay back in the day if you were making money. So if there was businesses behind it, cocaine's stunning. It's used as a local anesthetic. I never let the dentist dude fentanyl that shit prints at scheduled to, oh my god, morphine scheduled to opm scheduled to cody and scheduled to I believe a meth schedule to. Yeah. And how um, oh,

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       in that article it said that the south past all of these anti cocaine laws because after the race riots and then they were like scared. And then in san francisco they pass an opium ordinance targeting chinese people. So it was like kind of racially bent back in the day. But of course we'd was never an Industry behind it. So they just, you know, didn't have the capitalized fuck man. Jeff sessions is a little little elf. Why is he, it's so bizarre. He's was just like this old man who's totally out of touch and for some reason he's just. What are they going to do though? Because California just legalized weed. I mean, how are they going to continue with dea raids and stuff? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       I think no, but they are doing a bunch of sneaky shit like Washington dc as a disproportionate number of arrests on people of color for marijuana. They're getting arrested even though Washington dc has legal recreational marijuana, there was still arresting black people. It's fucked up. It's really weird. There was a whole article on it. They can't really. They're arresting them, but they can't really do anything, so they just arresting them there. They just go through the system. They get processed and I mean I don't think they're getting jay. They're obviously getting jailed initially or at least brought in for to be booked, but it's just the idea that this is still going on despite all the evidence. It just shows you what a corrupt system. Totally. And americans just totally want legal, recreational marijuana. Well that's the only thing holding that sessions got back. Is it 57 percent of americans support, legalized recreational marijuana, which is just unprecedented this, it's never been that high before.

Speaker 4:          00:19:26       And that's people willing to answer polls. I would venture that if you really got down and dirty with a bunch of people like you and I that aren't answering polls, I bet you're going way over 70 percent because it just doesn't make any sense. And when dc passed the law, um, it was overwhelming and that's where all the legislators are. Like obviously they want it to. So what the hell is holding his back here? You guys are in dc, you all smoke weed is a massive, massive amount of money that still being spent by really odd groups like prison guard lobbies, which is really crazy. Then we use unions. Yeah. They want more people in jail so they can make more money and get more hours. It's so crazy. It is like vampires shit because you think about what you're doing. You're literally trying to suck money out of people's lives. I mean, they don't look at it that way. They're looking at it like we're going to keep jobs for these american prison workers. We're going to keep american jobs just trying to get create jobs. Joe. Now we're creating jobs.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       don't you see the. The good thing behind this record, it's spooky as a comedian. I mean I know that like the outright is kind of blended in with like this anti pc culture that I think comedians relate to, but like do you just wake up and things like, holy shit, Donald Trump. Is the president ever? Are you laying stone? Isn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:20:40       Before my last special, my last special aired in november, which is right before the election, and I was like, do you know how fucking close we are? And people were laughing, guy, he's not going to win. I'm like, no, he's fucking right there. It could happen. And then boom, he became president and I just like, wow. It's so surreal, but it, it highlights to me how preposterous this system of having one person run this whole thing is. It doesn't an any. I know there's a cabinet. I know. I understand the legislation legislative process. I understand there's a senate and the congress, I can't. I get it, but still he's got a lot of fucking power. He's did. What was the thing that he shut down? He shutting down the epa database.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       Oh yeah, yeah. When they had to like start rogue twitter accounts, they're like, we need to put out the climate data in case trump deletes it. It'S like, how does, how does he have this much? exactly. How does the executive branch have this much power?

Speaker 4:          00:21:35       I think he's just doing shit and then they have to stop it somehow or another and no one wants to stop it. Like he's. He's just doing shit. Whether or not he can or can't do shit. I mean he's just doing it and then you have to figure out a way to reverse it, but it's already getting done like the epa standards that some spooky shit because that's the literally the ground that we grow our food in. The water that we drink, the air that we breathe is one of the most important things, but it becomes this. It becomes this ideological issue between right and left were right, wants work and jobs and industry and left once water to be clean and like it's fucking insane that that became one of those issues that it's. It's an ideological thing that if you're on the right, you're supposed to, if not deny climate change. You're supposed to ignore it at the very least, and if you're on the left, you're supposed to be a tree hugger and a hippie and you're supposed to be all about clean water. The fact that these people can make these distinctions like that and then figure out a way to make money despite that you're poisoning the mother earth. It's just. It's insane. It's weird. Yeah. It's like there's gotta be another way to make money, guys. Yeah. You know what I mean? There's got to be this coal mining thing. You're going to read

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       night coal mining. Trump kept calling it clean coal like, what are you talking about? Are we living in the fifties, eat it, eat it, eat it, drink the water in flint, and it was like, oh, water is clean. We're all good. FuckIng evacuate. Immediately

Speaker 4:          00:23:00       pa as a different store, the agency says it has no plans to shut down the website, much less bury the data it makes accessible and never did. Okay, so they are fighting back.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       No way. So the epa is not. So the data is not. So were. Who were those robots? Can fake news? Who were those rogue accounts that were saying, oh, we're gonna

Speaker 5:          00:23:21       the, uh, the story where you came from like a context, or excuse me, data taken out of context from the trump administration. They are gonna maybe take out 31 percent of the epa budget,

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       but they're just going to get to the pentagon. You heard about that too, right?

Speaker 4:          00:23:40       Twenty five percent in the cut in the workforce. So they're going to get rid of 25 percent of the epa far as the workforce and in 31 percent of the money. That's hilarious. So that means the people that remain are gonna leave. because look, if you cut out 31 percent and then 25 percent of the workforce, that means you're cutting out more money than you are cutting out people. so I guarantee you that's going to, that's goIng to equate to people leaving.

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       Yeah. And the whole like climate accords or whatever that, you know, the us is not only the biggest polluter, the pentagon pollutes more than any other entity in the world. But then yeah, the pentagon itself, just the military. Oh yeah. All the billions of plastic debris in the ocean. All the fucking bombs exploding. God knows what we're doing around the world. Um, but yeah, I mean when the pentagon is the biggest polluter and then you pull out of the paris accords or whatever, like trump was just like, yeah, like we're going to pull out of that climate change agreement. It's like, well, who's going to hold it together? Then it already wasn't enough weight and you know, it's like these. And then he just puts exxon mobil in charge of the state department. I mean, it's so much crazier than halliburton. It's so much crazier than condoleeza rice has ties to exxon, the actual ceo. I just can't even wrap my mind around it.

Speaker 4:          00:24:49       It is amazing. I mean, it's amazing that we didn't learn from the dick cheney

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       exxon. They're like, run the country like a business. It's like, all right, I'm just going to put actual ceos in charge of all these departments and that's going to be good. Like, is thAt fucking good?

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       Well, it would be good if you streamline the business and tried to make it more practical and cut out waste and bureaucracy and red tape and made it better for everybody, but as soon as you start saying things like, we're going to shut down all those satellites that track global warming, like, whoa, why? Why you doing that? Shouldn't we know what the fuck is happening? Shouldn't we know? Shouldn't we have good estimates is when the people in miami, you're going to drown, right? Because they're going to drown. They're going to droWn in a 40 or 50 years or so. People in miami are fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       Those people are fucking put that head. The head of the epa is a climate change denier. He was a guy like embroiled in a lawsuit against the epa. Yeah. That's not good, rIght? No, I would say that's not a good thing. Now that guy have you look at every department, rick perry, the guy who's, you know, we go from dancing with the stars and now he's in charge of the department. He wanted to abolish. Did you on dancing with the stars? Yeah. And then he was like, he wanted to abolish the energy department and then of course he's appoinTed to run the energy department and didn't even know what the hell it did the energy department, like as is what houses are like nuclear weapons. So it's like, okay, did you know that? Like how stupid are you? How are you running for president? How about ben carson to. He make him like department of houSing or some shit like surgeon general. He's got damn doctor. Yeah. like instead of Like a. Yeah, instead of some surgeon, he's like, yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:26:27       didn't you mAke him in charge of like neurosurgery? He's like a fucking neurosurgeons. Shouldn't you be in charge of educating the board on are the, you know, the government on the science behind neurosurgery and like let's, let's stay on board with all this

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       research and science. Utilize your expertise. Maybe it's like a joke. I mean, the whole thing is like a reality show. Looking back on it, I do think, you know, I believed all the polls and I was, I don't know why because there are, you know, it's coming from like this ivory tower elite who's totally out of touch with the rest of the country, but I really did believe that trump had no chance because I thought hillary would steal the vote. I mean if it came down to, and I'm like, they have, they have measures in place. They're really like, locked this dowN. I was like, there's still a way, and when he won I just couldn't believe it. But looking back on it, it makes so much sense. It's like, how could he not have one? Hillary was the most corrupt clay candidate, 30 years of just a legacy of horrible death and destruction or husband and ruined the economy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       Horrible arrogance, right? Bill clinton ruin the economy. Deregulation up the ass. He was an officer yet. And that's what happens right before it craShes, right? The buildup of all the banking regulations, the telecom communications act, prison at a street. It was clinton years. Good time. So for vince foster trump, trump is um, and all the women that I raped. How crazy was that when trump brought up sexual assault victims? That's hardcore. I was just like, dude, it was right before the debate is why wasn't playing games? He was not playing games. I had told him. He asked you this because you're a journalist. What did you think about the wiki leaks claim that the young man who was murdered in Washington dc was the guy who gave them the info center, whatever his name was. You know, people don't know the story. He was a young guy who was working for the dnc.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       He was murdered at like 3:00 in the morning or something crazy. They shot him in the back anD they didn't take anything from him. They didn't take his wallet, his phone, his, his cash. They left everything. So they called it a robbery, a robbery tip, but he was essentially assassinated. And the investigation is just nonexistent. You don't hear a god damn word about it. I don't know if anybody's like currently, you know, working on it where we don't hear about it, but it's not something that's brought up in the news. It's just one of those things. He was killed. there's no leads and that's it. It was odd that julian is. Andre mentioned that as if it was like, you know, leading people to think that he was the leaker. I don't know. Well, that's what he said is essentially his words to paraphrase were that there are consequences to giving us information that's a pretty serious charge. Basically like he was killed. He was alive. If julian assange is a liar, if that's not true, that everything he says has to be taken. You have to take into consideration everything he says because he's a liar now because he did. He really like. Did he actually come out and say that or did you kind of insinuate being this guy was killed and that's let's find out what's. Find out what his exact words were. I'm pretty sure that his words were that there are consequences for giving

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       us information. It's just so crazy when you look at what that allegation was like, Russia hacked our election and 52 percent of democratic voters actually think they hacked the vote when really it was just pedesta fell for fucking phishing scam because he's an old idiot. Yeah, I used to.

Speaker 4:          00:29:59       That's what I heard. Allegedly. Well, you know, that guy is super problematic regardless of how ridiculous the pizza gate thing is and what's real, what's not real, what is real is it? Him and his brother were Close friends with dennis hastert who was the speaker of the house who was fucking kids for decades, fact these in jail for fucking kids. That was the speaker of the house. The idea that the speaker of the house could be a serial child molester and that's what he is. I mean, there's literally with the judge called him when he sentenced him. That's insane. And alan dershowitz, trump and

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       clinton were on the lolita express. Would that billionaire, that rape plane that had like a bunch of underage girls? I mean all of them. Yeah. What does that feel? What does that do? I mean, it was just this crazy billing or who had some island that was known as some like sex ring and had a bunch of young kids and all these. All these dudes were.

Speaker 4:          00:30:53       We're going there. Here it goes. Whistleblowers go through significant efforts to get us material. Often very significant risks. A 27 year old, the worse for the dnc was shot in the back murdered just two weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street and Washington. So, and the guy says, anchor. That was just a robbery, not true. NothIng was robbed. Says I believe, wasn't it? And assad says, no, there's no finding. So, uh, and then the anchor says, what are you suggesting? What are you suggesting? He says, I am suggesting that our sources take risks and they, they become concerned to see things occurring like that. Huh? But was he one of your sources? Sources? I mean, the anchor says, and he says, we don't comment on who our sources are and the anchor says, but why make suggestions about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington? Assan says, because we have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States. our sources are sources face serious risks. That's why they come to us so we can protect their anonymity. Hmm. I found an article about representational state transfer that series. The government is fucking monitoring my conversation with abby martin. I just want to say to the government listened, you fuCks. You could just watch the podcast like everybody else. You don't have to attack my goddamn phone. So that Is really great.

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       so he's kind of saying it without saying it. I don't know why he's doing that. He also tweeted out some pizza gate thing, so I don't know what, what the deal is. We all know that, that that's not. But here's the thing about the pizzagate thing is there's a lot of weird shit.

Speaker 4:          00:32:26       They're like the little international child molesting symbol was a part of their logo. All the weird artwork that that guy. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       Well, I, you know, I did a whole expose and podesta and he is a bougie chef so it's not

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       surprising that he would talk about pizza as being some like really high brow chef and they pride themselves on how they cook all these expensive dinners and have these dinner parties and then the spirit cooking thing is like they're really into this elitist subversive art scene and so they have. Yeah, they have weird ass art and it's really creepy. Whatever they do nails when they're talking about little kids coming over and getting in the jacuzzi and hanging out with them. The kids were going to entertain them. I mean, I don't know. I need a little bit more to, to really go down that rabbit hole. Yes, there's pedophilia. Yes, it's in high places. The lolita express thing is a really glaring example, but in terms of like john podesta been involved in a, in a pedophile sex trafficking ring, I, I feel like we need a little bit more to go on because I feel like the what's out there right now, it seems pretty self explanatory. It's like the art and the

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       the cooking stuff. I agree with you, but little kids coming over the house and getting in the jacuzzi like that little kids are coming over for entertainment. Did you ever read that? I read the email. It did and it seemed like they're just really out of touch with how to talk about like their child fucking need to mask it better. Like I have kids, I have kids that age and if I'm in the I'm sending an email to someone else, you know? Oh yeah, you know, blah blah, blahs friends are coming over. Yeah. I think we're going to have like pizza or something. We're going to have a pizza party for the little ones. What you just say it like that? Yeah. You don't say they're going to come over and entertain us. Like what were the exact pull up old creepy how Alex Jones interpreted that was saying.

Speaker 4:          00:34:11       Did he get crazy? He got super crazy about that email. About that email specifically being like, this is obviously like they're reaping these kids in the jacuzzi there. Well, it is weird. I don't know what he's saying, but there's where my favorite thing about alex is when he freaks out. Then he say, apologize. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jump on. Never swear like that, but these fucking goddamn goddamn fucking pizza lovers. Okay. We planned to heat the pool, so a swim as a possibility. Bonnie will uber service to transport ruby emerson and mave lasagna, whatever. Eleven, nine and almost seven. So you'll have some further entertainment and they will be in that pool for sure. What does that mean? Like why is he bringing kids over his house? Oh no man. The scumbag. But that's odd. And did you ever see that thing where a bright bart had said that many years ago he made a tweet that was weird. Super weird, right? Like how does, how does pedesta get away with being a. What was the exact word? Forget wofo. Jamille. Something about super crazy. Yeah. About essentially covering up for kid fuckers. Well, how weird

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       do you think it is that trump seems to be the first president or anyone really in a political

Speaker 4:          00:35:27       is how progress guru john podesta isn't a household name as world class under age, sex slave op cover, upper defending unspeakable dregs escapes

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       me really heavy in. This was in february of 2011 before hastert was arrested, so this very well could have been connected by the way. Hastert only did 15 months for being a serial child molester. What band? And also worked for a bunch of child molesters that ige, this internet gaming entertainment company that just like mind virtual resources and world of warcraft games and would sell them and he was like a money bundler for goldman sachs because he's a goldman sachs shill and he was working for like all the people on the board. We're just pedophiles. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I think prince brock was one of the guys and then one of the guys is still on the run and has been for the last 10 years, so where all the pizza gate people didn't know about it. Now they did. I mean, it's crazy and it's a bowling alley now it's going to be bowling gate, but what do you think about trump being really one of the first people who's won a political office that has catered to like the conspiracy crowds and conspiracy culture and the Alex Jones crowd and ronald reagan figured out that if you caught the christian right, they will vote for you.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       I mean there's a. There's a whole market in that. It look, the conspiracy that look, Alex Jones has a gigantic audience. Tens of millions people. People discard him as some crazy outlier. He has an audience of tens of millions of people. Huge. He gets as many downloads as the biggest podcast world probably, and he's on, I don't know how many different radio stations, but I, I want to say it's more than a hundred. He's, he's got a crazy reach, so it was a wise move by trump and as long as he gets on alex's show and doesn't say anything to fucking crazy like those people, like I can't believe the president is with alex. You get those people and then you get the people that don't like alex. You get those people to. You get the hardcore republican base who just want to quote unquote make America great again and wear red hats. You get those people to.

Speaker 2:          00:37:36       Yeah. This is extremely smart. Yeah. That's how went. I mean, he's a reality star. Who won the biggest reality competition in the world. You're right. That's exactly how to put it in. It was the first time that an actual popular person entered this popularity contest. That's really what, happily. Totally. That's exactly what happened. And you're right, he knew how to play the audience. Bannon knew exactly how to work the media to, um, it's fascinating to, to cultivate that Alex Jones crowd because people are analyzing the results of the election and wondering, you know, how do you win? HoW did he win? To me, I feel like that's a huge component that no one really puts any credit to is that Alex Jones, this, this like voting block that never was really active before, like, other than ron paul will also this outright thing that we were talking about.

Speaker 2:          00:38:21       There's a, there's, there's groups of people that were never interested in politics that are now treating it the same way they treat sports. The these guys are sports fans. I mean, that's really what it's like. It's like, this is my team. I'm on team trump, you know, and these fucking. It's like, yeah, it's a corp man in and they're showing up at these berkeley rallies and they're fighting with people now. Like now you've got people responding. This is one of the real problems with the left, the real problem with these really hardcore lefties that are outraged and want to do something and they want to be positive so they want to shut down all these people like milo that the thinker nazis or ann coulter and all these people. But by doing that and by having these gigantic protest and it literally shutting down people communicating and talking.

Speaker 2:          00:39:11       You invite people to resist that and then you start these antifa people hit people in the head with fucking bike locks. You see the, they found that it was a professor that was hitting people in the head with bike locks and that this is going to have people show up and want to hit you with something and so you can you see now, and I've seen plenty of footage of trump protesters and supporters beating other people out. It's like getting comfortable on both sides. Coming from both sides now, but I almost feel like this is a manufactured thing because I think that there's been from the oakland area and I've an antifa has been showing up at every protest for as long as I can remember and the cops kind of like our hands off and so I feel like to provoke the antifa block where you know that they're like really strategically oriented and keep going to berkeley and keep going at berkeley and then making it like this big free speech blowout where it's like, why do you keep going?

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       And like creating the situation. You kind of know what's going to happen. It seems like a manufactured thing and then at the end of the day it makes the left easier to demonize and end Basically protests easier to demonize where now you have 200 people facing felony riot charges at the inauguration protests and a couple of them are just journalists who are filming and all the trump people are like, whatever. They're fucking writing and they're fascists in there. [inaudible]. It's like, well, because this happened in berkeley now, like all protesters are, you know, they're scapegoated to these people and I still get to. It's easy to box people in, but I think what's going on at berkeley is it's the most outrageously liberal place in the country in berkeley is and always has been. Like if you go there. Exactly. It's so lefty that it's like it's a great target.

Speaker 2:          00:40:50       It's a great place to get things popping. So if I was milo or if I was ann coulter and what is the culture do? I mean she Wants to sell books. I mean she's a troll, she's a troll, she's totally patrol and we tell them to be able to rule like probably ashley. Just one of those, she's just, she's a performance artist. Performance. Exactly, exactly. She's absolutely a performance artist and not a very good one because if she was that in trump, we trust book like the whole cover, like what in the fuck is that? I mean it was just bizarre. Just bizarre that, that like that she wrote that book. It was almost like, okay, this is cheap. Even for her, like this is just like a cheap ploy during this whole trump movement. She sees the, the whole momentum of the country, so she's going to write a book and

Speaker 4:          00:41:33       put trump in the title of it. It's like, it's so stupid, but it's weird. It's just weird that it's so easy, but it makes sense. Just like we were talking about how reagan sort of mobilized the right wing, conservative people that were christians that really weren't about politics before that, and he kind of brought them in. People real like they look at it and go, hey look, this is an angle. You know, there's an angle we can take that no one's been taking and this you're kind of like a bait and switch. This whole mila, mila berkeley thing becausE they know exactly what's going to happen when they go there and then of course that's exactly what happens and then they can use it to be like free speech, free speech. I mean it just. Well he knows what he's doing. Yeah, it was a clever guy.

Speaker 4:          00:42:12       He's very clever. I Mean he knows exactly what he's doing and you know, and milo at one point in time, by the way was a guy who was very anti hate speech, you know, and it was very anti shutting down people who were writing things to hurt people. People have like pulled quotes of his from the past, whiCh is intEresting because, I mean I'm sure peOple's philosophies changed. I'm sure mine have and yours have, but this is like one more piece of evidence that what you're seeing with a lot of people that are in the public eye that are involved in this whole political arena is you're seeing, they're working angles. They're like, what's the angle like, okay, let's go that way and you can justify it. Look, I could justify a lot of different angles if I wanted to do that, if I want it to be.

Speaker 4:          00:42:57       If I wanted to be in an anti trump protest or an anti free speech poster, if I wanted to be a person who thinks that free speech should be limited because hate speech is not protected by the constitution. Like howard dean just said, that fucking asshole. He said hate speech is not protected by the constitution. The first amendment. Yeah. Yes it is. Howard. You fucking idiot. You're a goddamn representative. Nazi parties exist actually, and they can have rallies, you know like that. That happens in this country when he was saying it about two, but it was ridiculous. Our. He would. The way he said it, it wasn't even like justified. It wasn't like someone was saying like, hey, we need to gather up these gay people and hang them from stop signs. That's not what people are saying. It wasn't anything that extreme where he.

Speaker 4:          00:43:41       Oh, I think it was ann coulter, I think. I'm not sure who pulled that up, see if you can find it. I'm pretty sure howard dean was talking about ann coulter and he was saying that hate speech is not protected by the first amendment. So what is he advocating around to? Roundup angLed his arrest her for. He's just saying that she should be. That you can stop her talk. He just, you know what? It was our nuts. Poorly thought out statement that got trampled just thrown out and everybody sort of repeating it over and over and over again and I just don't think he thought about it when he was saying it or the consequences. Yeah. Here it is. Was it about anne culter? Yes. It was about hey cultures, upcoming speech in Vermont, the Vermont dnc chair, howard dean, elaborated on his argument that ann coulter's upcoming speech at berkeley does not have to occur because hate speech in

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       quotes is not protected by the first amendment. Fuck you, man. Of course. Look, just have someone to bait her. It's not that goddamn hard her. It has something to say what we're saying, but what about the safe, the safe space? like hysteria where people are like, we need to save spaces, but then, but then there it's the same people who are like, why are you protesting as like, let us debate, well then fucking what is it? Do you want safe spaces are not they? Because if you want to have debates or you want to have speeches, like you can't Stop people in berkeley from coming in protesting you, it's protecting you. It's such a fundamental idea that we all know that in order to, if you're gonna have a discussion with someone, you have to let that person established. This is what debates are about, right?

Speaker 2:          00:45:15       let that person establish their position and then give your counter to that position. If this is like so firmly established in the way we communicate and the way we go over ideas, that is essentially the marketplace of ideas. You have your idea. Someone has an opposing idea. If you don't let that person establish their idea and you shut it down, shut it down, and you throw in rocks and burning cop cars and throwing bricks through starbucks. Windows like you are feeding the whole resistance to your ideas. Flames like you're, you're, you're, you're feeding the people that are saying that they're right and you're wrong because you are against recently cheating feeding that again. People sympathize with like Richard Spencer after he got punched, you know, and that's, that's a problem. Yeah, it's a problem because all you have to do is let those people hang themselves, give them a rope, give them broad plenum talk, but you have to have someone qualified.

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       You have to have someone who can have that speech with them and you can't have the fucking audience shout them down either. It's a disservice to both ideas, both, but I've heard people say like as nazi-ism really a an idea worthwhile of putting it in the marketplace of ideas like your advocate is genocide. Okay. Richard spencer. So you that guy. Yeah. Okay. But if you are going to have someone debate them, you have someone debate them in a venue where let everyone watch it online. It's like, how do you debate someone that wants to exterminate you? like if you're like a black person, you're like, I'm in a debate. This guy who, whose main premise of the argument is you shouldn't exist. That's kind of I, I, I've, I've heard people, it's a, it's a confusing topic, but if you don't debate them, if you don't, if you shut down their speech, if you stop and then you can, they can frame what they were going to say in a very different way.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       They can, they can gather sympathy with people who were more pro speech, more pro free speech than they are anti what you're saying. I think that they, they still are a, like we were saying before, nazis still have rallies like no one is shutting down these from a government level. So I think the whole censorship thing is not relevant to this situation because that really does mean like the black end of the state like coming down and blocking you and instead we have what we cntf a blocking like physically these, these venues. But it's not like these people are blocked from having venues or access or speech

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       platforms. I mean they're fucking everywhere. It's like I feel like all over the news, it's Richard Spencer, the dapper nazi, like all these interviews, aren't these speeches in this one place? Aren't they very retro like why even do it that way? Why have an audience? Why have an angry mom yelling outside or even inside like create and cultivate these situations and they can be the martyrs, right? That free speech, martyrs. That's exactly what they're doing. It's a very poor way to go over ideas though I think a better way to go over ideas. As you have a moderator and two people in a room together, you know that that simple one person isn't a lot of time where they can express themselves than the other person has a lot of time where they can counter and you're not allowed to chime in. You're not allowed to interrupt.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       You're not allowed to in any way disrupt this person's flow of ideas. Then there should be a time set aside where you could Go back and forth with each other and unless you do it that way, you're going to involve the cult of personality. You're going to involve the cheers from the crowds. You're going to involve all these different people that can organize to Sway things one way or another or all this, shut it down, shut it down, shut it down, and it's. It gets as ridiculous as like Jordan Peterson speeches and I'm sure you've seen that professor of university of toronto that doesn't want to use all these meetup, gender pronouns. The 78 now accepted gender pronouns Canada has really weird laws in Canada. Has they don't have free speech the way we have free speech and they have a human rights council and they've decided that these 78 or whatever the fuck they are, however many they decide on gender pronouns, that if you don't use them, if someone says, you know, I want you to call me fox can 26, but for real, like if you don't do that, you're imposing on their human rights.

Speaker 4:          00:49:18       Other people have debated him and said that though that's not how it should be interpreted, but he's like a very staunch critic of marxism and he understands the, the real ideology of marxism and how it went horribly wrong all throughout the world, throughout history, and that he thinks that what you're trying to do when you, when you're invoking like this, when you're asking the government to tell people what they must or must not say, that you are going down this road, this very dangerous road of cultural marxist. Well, what does cultural marxism, because I've heard this said and I actually have no idea what the hell it means because marxism is simply a critique on capitalism, so I don't understand this whole cultural marxism like, well, let's let's get the dead house has anything to do with gender pronouns, but you'd have to talk to peterson about how it.

Speaker 4:          00:50:05       But he makes a very compelling argument about how the two of them are connected. Essentially what people are trying to do is control your behavior and they're just trying to in some way force you to behave the way they would like you to behave, even if it's a preposterous thing, like making up words and you have to call them this instead of he, she or even like even like the people that want to use they riches know plurals, which is fine. I mean like that's a real word, you know, if you want to use it in an incorrect way and it does get used like, you know, uh, it does use like if anybody wants to use the bathroom, they can go ahead. You can be using that in a singular term, you know, and you, you're, it's non gender specific. So there is like open interpretation in the stanDard use of it in the english language. So pulled up the term cultural marxism

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       that was looking for. I can't really find a great definition for it. Uh, it's a couple like the google research assistants, a couple of things. Calling it a conspiracy theory,

Speaker 4:          00:51:06       the urban dictionary definition. This isn't like an obvious social political movement that promotes unreasoned and irrationality through the guise of various causes offering promoted by so called social jet. This is a perfect example of it. These causes and their proponents often are often contradictory and are almost always never rooted. in fact indeed true argument or discussion with proponents of these causes. It's almost impossible at most as most attempts at discourse descend quickly into shouting name, calling and chanting slogans. Well, that's a perfect otherwise known as the regressive

Speaker 1:          00:51:41       left a plate on the contradictory nature. I think that this is, this seems to be like a hub of the alt right word. This is founded on like this reactionary movement on pc culture, on things like that, gender pronouns thing, and it seems like there was no real political ideology behind what is the outright other than just a reaction to this. like I don't want to conform to this progressive whatever, cultural marxism, but to me I feel like I just. I don't knoW. It doesn't bother me as much. Like what bothers me right now is just like the empire fucking killing people on my name. Trump. No disgusting war criminal who's flipped flopped on all the shit that he said that he said. That's a different argument, but you're absolutely right. That's what I'm saying is these people are that upset about leftists, like they think leftists are the problem and that cultural marxism is like ruining society and it's like, what is this government doing? Like The answer never stopped with when trump won. Jordan peterson a, he's progressive. He's a liberal.

Speaker 4:          00:52:34       So this, I mean the guy who's arguing against cultural marxism. Marxism is actually a progressive. He's actually the liberal. I mean he's not, he's not a republican. He's definitely not outright. He's canadian. So they obviously have different parties up there, but he's not an alright guy. He's a professor. I mean he's not, he's just sees that there's a bunch of people on campus that are trying to control the way other people communicate.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       It'S just such as poor posture. Yeah, I, I totally hear that and I see where people are really upset about that and it just, you know, I see sj was in leftists are ruining everything and to me it just seemed like such an isolated, like totally inconsequential thing to what's going on in the rest of the world and especially what trump is ramming down everyone's throats. It's like, is this really the main issue here? No, it's not, but I agree with you to a certain extent, but to not address that or to write it off, it empowers

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       the people that are fighting against it because this year you're ignoring it. Like to them it'S a giant issue. The issue of free speech, the issue of not having people in force, whatever ideology that they have on you that you have to behave the way they want you to communicate, they want you to or you're a bigot or you're a nazi, like punch a nazi. Meanwhile you're an actual christian evangelicals employing top down policy that's actually telling people, here's how education's going to be around here, so we're going to be indoctrinated. Like that's what I feel like we're really missing the boat here. All these new atheists who agree with what you're saying, like don't want to be policed and aRe more in line with trump. How come they're not speaking out against the christian evangelical hold over this adMinistration? Well, which ones are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       Like, oh, I know. I don't know. I just kind of said that in the ether, but I guess I just haven't seen enough critique of trump for bringing in this religious fanaticism, rc. Nothing. But I've seen really great. Maybe it's really good to hear it in different circles. That's great. But um, people are talking about that. Well, what'S weird is that people think that trump is so inept. They almost would prefer mike pence and even ted cruz. Terrifying, but it mean who's is it better or worse? It's like you're not even choosing the lesser of two evils. You're choosing in competence versus this radical right wing christian ideology that we were terrified of in the beginning or from the beginning. It's like ted cruz would have been a terrible president, but many people now think he would've been a better president than Donald Trump and ted cruz and mike pence would never have won because they're disgusting creatures and ted cruz is the creepiest motherfucker I've ever seen where he.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       He actually tweeted a photo of like a butterfly cow made out of butter and said, and he was like, my daughter's first word was butter. It's like, wow, you creepy psycho. So that creepy to you. That's creepy. It's weird. It's just weird. It's just really in a butter. Butter is delicious. It is delicious bread on toast. He's super fucking weird. But yeah, these people would never win without trump being that conduit to like get in the white house. And so I think that with trump not there, you don't have this veneer where people are like, oh, trump's really liberal. Like, oh no, he really believes in this stuff. It's like you would just have pence and that would be really straightforward of exactly who pence is and what he believes in. Well, marco rubIo sucks as a debater, but god damn, he's an eloquent and really well spoken man.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       OutsIde of those debates. He just folded under pressure. He's not good with conflict, but he's been outstanding. Yeah, he's been outstandIng since then. He just doesn't know how to deal with that. That big fucking looming cultive personality asshole, and he just doesn't know how to deal with it. Trump is such a baby. He's such a pamper baby. I saw this chart of um, how many times, like, you know, this is kind of a stupid thing because I'm not opposed to like taking vacations or golfing or whatever, but the amount that he's gone where he's just like gone. Half the weekend. Maro lago, like golf. They Spent $10 so far in the first hundred days, trump spent almost as much money as obama did an entire year on his vacation. That's the first one. Hundred days. So pampered. He can't even get away from this world that he's a part of where he has to go to a fucking country club and be surrounded by billionaires.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       It's also so incredibly hypocritical because he was constantly complaining about obama taking vacations and going golf and he's golf more than anybody. You look at the first hundred days of clinton, bush, obama and him. It's like no one has done this. I think obama maybe went golfing once in the first hundred days and trump is like every week, four out of seven days. He's just gone. It's like, who's running the country here? It is weird. It's crazy. I just want to finish yesterday or sunday that he hasn't taken a international trip yet and at this point I think George Bush had taken to and obama taken a too busy at maro lago international trip for out of the country to go meet another leader. Come to make that come to me. Come play golf. Come on. I got a great place. We have the best, the best steaks, the best come back. We really do. We really do remember how weird that was when even have all these props like the steaks and the manila folders and all these things like on the magazines and jet. He loved all these props, number that. No, he was doing all these campaign rallies on one one campaign. Rally had a bunch of trump steaks out on a table.

Speaker 2:          00:57:50       I didn't even know trump steaks until last week. Was it moshe? Moshe turned me on to trump steaks. Moshe is a emotion. Casher was a show that's on comedy central right now. Moshe is a super hardcore lefty. It's really interesting because he and I were having this conversation on the phone last night or texting back and forth. He goes, we were talking about. He's at. He asked me to find like a suitable representative of the alt right come on his show and sort of talk about these ideas. I my poor boy, who the fuck is a suitable represent sorry. Through some people at adam, every name I threw out and he's like, oh no, I know, but that's what you're asking for it. He's like, milo would have been great, but he's so tainted now. I'm like, yeah, I get it. Pedophilia is the thing that brought him down and it was just crazy of all places.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       It's like, wow. They did lose three hours. He got loose, started talking about what your reaction. Your reaction was really fun in that too. You're like, that sounds like. Well, he was trying to justify his own, his own victimization. He was molested as a child. Was trying to turn around and say that he was. He said, I was the predator. Don't get it wrong. He's basically trying to empower himself. He was fucked by a priest when he was 13. I mean this is the reality of his life. That is terrible. And he's trying to figure out a way where that empowers him and I just find it interesting like the tommy lauren thing was fired because she was pro choice. It's like that went too far for the blaze. Know, like the pedophilia things too far for, for the outright. Right. I was thinking that about hillary clinton.

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       How crazy would it be if chelsea clinton went to work for the blaze? Oh god. If she started, she started going super hardcore. Right? And she's got two flags, motorcycle jacket on, pearly whites. The hedges. Go interrupt those. Antiwar demonstrations. Again, chelsea, just like you used to be a nightmare. I mean this, what do you think about the Syria thing though? Trump within two days of the chemical weapons attack, he's already bombing assad and that was a big point of contention. I know with the Alex Jones communiTy with the alt right. I think a lot of them were anti intervention because that's what he was saying and so what is, what do you think is going on? Because you have that whole argument where like, oh, all these people are pulling them in different directions. He doesn't really want to do this. What do you think?

Speaker 2:          01:00:07       Well, I think he's incredibly impulsive. I mean that's sort of been established that he's very impulsive. So I also think that he's got this desire to be a strong leader and to be a guy who make strong decisions and it's not going to take any bullshit, you know? And I worry about that. That scares the shit out of me because when you really find out how much the power the president has in terms of like launching a nuclear strike and then you look at the conflict that we're getting into with North Korea, it's entirely possible. I mean, they are moving nuclear submarines right now as we speak off the coast of North Korea. That is happening right now as we speak. It was. They were talking about it today. It's in the news right now. This is terrifying because if they decide to launch a warhead at North Korea, the odds of someone retaliating are so fucking high and if they do retaliate, it's probably going to be los angeles.

Speaker 2:          01:01:02       It's probably going to be. We're the closest. We're the closest to North Korea and we're also the closest. I guess we would be the target for China. I guess we would be the target for a lot of places. Yeah. Let's talk about this North Korea thing really quickly because the media is painting it like North Korea, like we're going to strike back really when North Korea is repeatedly said, we will never striked the us ever. Will never strike anyone unless we're attacked. What are they doing that we're so intense with them right now? They are doing missile, missile tests. They don't even work. They tried to missile and it blew up that. But that's how crazy the us has. And we have historical amnesia where americans don't know geography until we bombed somewhere. Right? So we have completely no memory about the korean war where theu , s military invaded North Korea and bombed napalm the fuck out of the country for three years. Killed Twenty percent of the population killed three to 5 million people left the country. We just completely forgot. North koreans haven't forgotten. They haven't forgotten. They have a deep seated hatred for the us for a good reason. Um, and americans have no idea. We probably don't even know what that we went to war with Korea that they don't even think about. Why is there a north and South Korea? Like, what the fuCk is this? You know, it's so kim, jon, uhm,

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       obviously probably what he's learned by now in terms of us empire, imperialism and interventions is that you have to not only act like, you will use nukes, like you have to have nukes and you have to act like you will use them if you get attacked, unless you want to get invaded. Look what happened with gaddafi, saddam, all these things. Assad, you give up your chemical weapons and then it doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          01:02:41       Well, I'm, I'm terrified. I'm terrified of this whole North Korea conflict. As I think everybody is. It's, it's a terrifying place first of all because it's one of the last really obvious military dictatorships in this country, in the world rather. There's not a whole lot of them left, but that's one of the last one since one of the ones that's like, you can see it. There are so extreme. They see them goosestepping walking down the street. You see the people wailing in agony. When kim jong il died, like it's, it's a very, very strange world where people are born in prison and they live as prisoners their whole life. And some of them as escaped and detailed the horrors of the prisons and what's going on with that worries me is because it won't be hard to sell. Exactly. Yeah. People already are like, of course in North Korea is horrible. That prison camps, labor camps is undeniable. So like, yeah, I guess we should just do regime change. That's what I was going to get to is what you had said before the podcast started, that it's a massive reserve of minerals in North Korea and this is what you and I were talking about, conflict minerals and phones before the podcast started and that they know that this, by the way also Afghanistan, trillions of dollars of minute minerals in Afghanistan, conflict minerals. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:03:57       We're still fucking there. To be honest, 16 years later we dropped that mother of all bombs that, that like dick measuring contest that trump just laid his dick out on the table and was like, oh no, drop this giant fucking bomb, dusted off from the shelf. It's been sitting there. Bush wasn't even crazy enough to use it and all of a sudden people are like, wait, we're still in Afghanistan and isis is no one. No one asks any questions. Why is isis there? Why are we still in Afghanistan? Everyone's like, oh, cool. Another one. Let me see. Let me see the video. Lindsey graham's like, oh cool. Boom. It's disgusting, dude. I mean there was 95,000, I think 100,000 people who lived in the and district like this was a. This wasn't just a mountain region with goats. I mean there are people there. The way that afghans are dehumanized and the way that the media cheered on the Syria strike and this moab thing makes me fucking sick. Brian williams is sitting up there quoting leonard cohen. He was like, they're beautiful. The bombs are beautiful. He said it to me. He said, I'm bunch of times. It was amazing in like 30 seconds. It was weird. It was sick.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       It's almost like he's trying to make up for the fact that he lied about being in that helicopter, trying really hard to make up for us. Like look, just you just gotta go hardcore, right? Just go all the way. Just talk about how beautiful it is. And it was like. And then fareed zakaria here they are telling

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       us that trump is mentally unfit. Puppet of Russia, who's retarded yet the second he starts bombing, it's like, oh, love it. First strike. Like he started bombing assad now. We all love him. Rachel maddow has been talking the last 30 days or three months, six months about how he needs to be impeached. He's guided by putin and then the second he started bombing Syria. Oh, it becomes a commercial for tomahawk missiles. Rachel maddow did a 30 minute segment just analyzing how efficient tomahawk missiles are.

Speaker 4:          01:05:44       Well, great. Why do you think she did that?

Speaker 3:          01:05:47       I think that the. There's a bipartisan establishment consensus on foreign policy and there has been. This is the empire, does the corporate media. I'm completely loves the empire. They love imperialism, they love selling wars. They have for a long time, joe. That's how I became a journalist because I saw the Iraq war been sold by quote leftists are liberals on tv and I just couldn't understand why they were selling a completely insane, unnecessarily illegal war where there was a lot of it.

Speaker 4:          01:06:14       well, there were selling it or at least in support of it because we were really terrified after nine slash 11, so after nine slash 11, there was this movement to do something and this massive amount of people that ordinarily would have a lot of distrust towards the right. They all of a sudden we're trusting in bush and trusting in the government to go and out adequate job.

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       So it'd be a stenographer because you're scared. That's like the time that you're supposed to step up and say, okay, I need to question my government's claims because we're in such a state of hysteria and acquiescence that I need to as a journalist. QuesTion authority question my government. That's the number one job that you have.

Speaker 4:          01:06:52       What was your thought? How old will. You're not old enough, really? How old were you at September 11th. Oh yeah, no, I was 18, so I was. What did you have any. Obviously when you're 18 it's hard to formulate.

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       Yeah, no, I'm my eye. I was stunned. I mean I agreed with the Afghanistan war at the time beCause I didn't really know and then I went into college and learned about what the fuck this government and country has been doing to the rest of the world and what militarism and empire has been doing. So I kind of put it together and then. But that was just Afghanistan. I really woke up when one day my mom called me and she was like, did saddam bama us? She said because every single media outlet has just switched over from Afghanistan to Iraq unquestioningly.

Speaker 4:          01:07:31       So do you think that like rachel maddow for me always seems like if there's anybody that's not toeing the line, it's that lesbian but it doesn't seem like she would be like, I like, she'd be like the perfect person to sell you some shit that you know, like you would never buy as a person on the left because she's like, she's super articulate. She's wicked sMart and she's obviously a lesbian and she's got short hair and she hated trump, so like if you wanted to sell something, she's your huckleberry

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       and she was trying to sell that Russia shit real hard. I mean she talked more about Russia than any other issue and that's the Problem with this so called resistance is that when you focus on a fake issue like Russia usurping trump's brain or like and trump's and puppeting

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       him, then you forget about all the rapid fire executive orders he's throwing down you. You aren't focusing on the real important things that he's doing that we could actually galvanize and stop and especially when you're just pro war, these motherfuckers are, they're funded by defense contractors in banks. That's what the corporate media is. That's what the corporate media is. She knows gone all in that. It's been like a coup against Russia. What's homeboy's name that used to be on espn? The fuck. Oh my god. Keith olbermann. The reason you saw, did you see the kermit the frog where he's like covered in the american flag? Did you see that crazy way? We should look that way. He's got a whole thing. It looks like he's in a basement somewhere. Nicer resistance. Sponsored by gq. What is going on with him? does he have children? I don't know what the hell is going on with the kids.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       I used to. I used to really, really like him. Psychologically. I used to as well. I used to think that he had some interesting rants. The problem is too many people liked it and then he like got drunk with it seems like now he's, he's his, his speeches are, they're almost like a parody of a guy who is. It's almost likE an old Christian Slater movie about a guy who's got like some sort of a ham radio thing and he's fighting against the oppressive government. It's really, really hurt tuna fish. Yes. cartoonish is the right word. Really weird. I saw this one like side by side, meme of him draPed in the american flag and he's like this, you know, on the cover of gq. And then someone put kermit the frog, like draped in a magazine. This is what keith olbermann thinks he looks like and this is what he really looks like and it was just like a little frog into. It's just nuts. I mean, what the hell is this guy doing and how, what is gq doing? IT's like you have teen vogue somehow leading the resistance and like what the fuck country.

Speaker 1:          01:10:04       His videos are so strange. There's so verBose and it's like, damn, that dude. Is this a first draft? It's like, it is. It seems like you've got a lot of extra words in there. We could, you could trim that down a little bit and have a little more impact. But I wait, I wrote this down because I wanted to say this. This is insane. So the pentagon just came out with a number. It said 70,000 people have been killed as a result of bombing Syria in Iraq since 2014. You're like, okay, that's crazy. Um, they said they called the militants. We already know that militant can be just a military age males. So really they include the libyan militant feminist feminists. You can build short hair, you know, lesbian on the, on the ground and they think they were a man. So They include like anyone who's probably over the age of 10 and a male as a militant. So anyway, these numbers are 70,000 people are killed. And then they said only 229 civilians were killed. So 70,000 militants, 229 civilians. Here's another interesting part. The cia in 2014, estimated that there are only between 30 to 40,000 isis fighters in Syria and Iraq. So are The. So I'm sorry,

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       what the fuck did these other 30,000 people come from and did you kill all isis? Like all isis has gone somehow their back because they're still staring. What year was the estimate? Two thousand 14 is when they said there were probably 30 to 40,000 and then the pentagon just came out and this is according to the la times 70,000 militants killed since 2014. Only tWo hundred civilians. Don't worry about it. Wow. That makes me feel really good. I've never seen one tear. I feel pretty good. Just killing a bunch of terrorists. Wow. THat's nuts. Yeah. No one questions. This shit man. It's sick. You will. I watch house of cards, so I have a really good grasp of the political system. Is the new sis a season out yet? Not yet. Next month. I'm still on the. I just started. I just started this year, so yeah, I binge watched. I went from the 2012 episodes all the way to. I'm on season four right now. God damn it. I was watching when it became really like all about the potent character because you know, first frank underwood's like he kills the journal.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       Robin white. They're bitches. Bad ass though. I'll tell you why she. She directs some of the best episodes to really? Yeah. Yeah. She directed. When I watched last night, I was like, jesus, creepy camera angles and they remind me of the clintons. Oh, for sure. I thought it should be. I thought it should be. It should have been illegal for hillary to even run. Yeah, because I, I look at them as a unit just like the underwoods, you know, and they work together where clinton even admitted that hillary was the one who sold the yugoslavia bombing and stuff and she even said, she was like, I'm an appoint build to run the economy. It's like again, destroyed the economy back in the nineties. How is this legal? My favorite footage of her of all time, where you really got to See behind the wizard's curtain was when kadafi died.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       That was sick when she was literally back her head laughing, going, we came, we saw he died after he was raped by a bayonet from the rebels that we funded and you could watch it like you could see stabbed in the asshole. You can watch him, you could watch him terrified and he doesn't even react. He's so fucked up. And then they're shooting them and killing them. They tried them around his dead body. It's fucked up. But watching that guy shoved that band at up to up his ass. It's like, whoa. And what was the premIse of the Libya thing? Now it's a completely failed state. Isis has totally taken over the country and where all the interventionists that were cheering on the Libya bombing and they all said gaddafi was on the verge of committing to massacre and ben gazi and we have to go in.

Speaker 2:          01:13:52       We have to do the no fly zone. Where all these people now. Where are these cheerleaders now? Yeah, just kind of a twitter message argument in Syria from a guy who lives in Libya. It was pretty deep. What did he say? Just terrified. He wants to talk about it. Just would love to be a guest on the podcast to the. I think the. The idea that you're going to remove a dictator and then everything's going to be fun is so crazy and so it's never worked ever. It'll work in Syria. How navy. What do you do? Like what do you do? If I can fucking do anything you to lead those people suffer when the police officers of the world, when has any humanitarian intervention resulteD in anything? Good. can you tell me? That's a good question. It's always killed more people than we're trying to save.

Speaker 2:          01:14:42       Well, trump bombed Syria because kids were gassed and in the meantime killed kids when he was bombing them. Germany now makes great cars and they used to make nazis. So have you heard the norm mcdonald? A bit about. Oh man, he has the best. Like nazi jokes. No. So good. It was so crazy to have all the head of all the comedians. He really pulls it off. What is a duty? We have to watch it. What is it that there's a reason? I mean, he's done a million. Norm is so crazy. Nuts. He's such a character. He's so great. he's always wearing like a letterman jacket and it's like, what the nuts. That's who he is to, you know, he doesn't, he doesn't even drive. Oh yeah. He's scared of driving. So weird. I flew with him randomly twice. Just randomly. Just like totally total dumb luck on two separate occasions as norm set right next to me and he's like a tree.

Speaker 2:          01:15:42       Can't believe this is happening. Yeah, it was. The last one was hilarious. We have this long conversation. We having a great old time and he's telling me, yeah, I quit smoking, I don't like to smoke anymore. It's just terrible. So hard to quit, but I'm glad it did. We land and he immediately walks right into a gift shop or buy cigarettes, so I changed my mind. I want to start smoking again and he's lighting before he gets out the door, but he's so impulsive. He's like walking towards doing. I'm like, whoa, like norm, what are you doing? He goes, yeah, I guess I smoke again.

Speaker 2:          01:16:17       There's people out there that are like pretending to be wacky. Right. He's really wacky. I love those people. There's so. There's so few of them who are just themselves like no matter what, just that's who norman is. He's great and he's so funny. David cross's new specials. Really good. Actually, it's not new. It was before trump got elected, but it's hysterical. His stuff on gun control is really, really funny and he's doing it to like a houston audience where it's a lot of trump supporters and he just goes balls to the wall, like everyone's walking out. Really just. Yeah, it's nuts. Houston is a strange place because it's all. There's a lot of liberals in houston, a lot more than houston is way more diversified than it gets credit for. It's a very interesting city. It's very interesting. I feel like dallas, austin, austin is the super lefty part. That's the most lefty part of Texas, but houston is way more cut down the middle. It's almost like it's a

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       split of austin and dallas and it's like you got the cool. Yeah. You got. I love houston. You got austin left dallas pretty right, and then you've got houston, which is like a combo plate bit. I mean, do you have any. Trump will get mad. People fucking attacked him and I made videos of people getting attacked for st. How are you not making fun of trump? It's Donald Trump. Well, they'll get it. They'll get it. Eventually it will take a little time. I mean when there's no way. Snowflakes. Yeah. There's no way this is going to keep going and be good. It's just. I really think, and this is what I think, and I don't think this is necessarily a reflection of who Donald Trump is or I just think the idea of a president is preposterous. The idea of one person that has that much power over hundreds of millions of people is insane.

Speaker 4:          01:18:05       It's an idea that was created back when people rode horses and roping with feathers. They used to. They used to fucking. I mean, that's really what it was. I mean, the whole representative government, you have a representative government because some people lived in North Dakota and how the fuck would you get worried to Washington? Well, you had to have somebody talking for you. Well now you can send an email. You fuck. You could vote online. The idea is antiquated. It's so behind the times and it's so behind the times to have one person have any sort of massive power and also I feel like the government works very hard to stop monopolies in certain sectors. Why don't they work so hard to stop it in government because this left versus right. This republican versus democrat thing is a goddamn ruse. Appropriations police themselves, great question. It's people.

Speaker 4:          01:18:52       It's like I think scholars, educators, people who actually understand the consequences of these ideological structures that were trapped in these, these, these are structures left versus right as a structure because they provide you with a predetermined pattern or behavior that you adopt and there's many, many easily influenced people that go super hardcore, right or super hardcore left because they want social brownie points within the structure and that's a natural part of being a human. It's a natural part of tribal behavior and it has to be addressed and it has to be addressed openly and it has to be addressed from a an understanding of fundamental understanding about a way the human mind works and the way the human psychology works and our need for social acceptance works. There's a lot of the way we behave that's just based on and predicated on these really simple, obvious principles that everybody knows. Peer pressure, the desire to be loved. Those things all play a massive part in how you're manipulated and how you manipulate yourself. You convince yourself of certain things. I really firmly believe that when you go super hard, right and super hard left, the distance between these two is not nearly

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       as far as you think and that the ideological point of views than the what they want and what they're trying to accomplish is very different, but the way they think, the way they've locked themselves into these predetermined thought patterns, they're not much different. They're just were indoctrinated one way or indoctrinated or another way they might have gone through the church system or they might've gone through the university system, but they've sort of both taken these hard line stances. Whereas the reality of the world and have most reasonable people is there's a lot of weirdness and there's a lot of variables to be considered in. Most people are not hard. Right and most people are not hard left theirs and you have to take one or the other and it's really the best way is probably a gigantic group that gets to decide on all sorts of different things and many, many different parties to choose from.

Speaker 2:          01:21:07       Like I think holland has something like don't they have like 16 different political parties or something that we have this two party dictatorship and I was reading this quote from chris hedges that really says it all. It's like exactly what you're saying right now. You have conservatives across the country who are worried about abortion and obsessing about these issues and then you have the liberals in New York who are obsessing about creationism in schools. Meanwhile, goldman sachs continues to fucking win. Yeah. It doesn't matter what you guys are squabbling about on the ground, left, right? Liberal, conservative, like these people are in power and they're going to further entrench their power. We're all the losers here and it's. Yeah, like you were just saying. I mean why do we have a system that props up these two parties that going back to the corporate media, continues to sell war after war continues to just sell off our government to corporations.

Speaker 2:          01:21:55       It's just the matter of which they do so well. Control of groups. Anytime you have one person or one organization that has control over a group, whether it's a dictatorship, whether it's a government, so like what, what is a government for? is it to control groups of people or is it to provide people with services like schools and utilities and infrastructure that should be like really what it is and the idea that war is an extra bowl. It's an extra bowl. You can't remove it from our culture. You cannot. I mean if you ask people, do you envision a time in your life or war doesn't exist? No one says yes, but yet sad is it's crazy. It's crazy. We just live in a war economy or that's just a necessity. It's like, well, we have to have just endless war. Right? What is that?

Speaker 2:          01:22:42       Is that the disconnection between human beings based on financial, financial situations, based on language, based on culture, based on religion, like all these differences are so vast that we have to launch bombs out of planes. I mean it's an indoctrination of american exceptionalism. going back to the historical amnesia about what this government has done. The rest of the world hasn't forgotten. The rest of the world is very acutely aware of what the empire does on a daily basis. We have no idea. Right. But it's every country. I mean it's every country with the military tries to enforce that military in some way, shape or form on other countries. I mean it's just, it's gone on since the beginning of time as far as people getting together in groups and then going over and conquering other people that have resources. Well, some people would say it's the, it's the system, the economic system that once you control one area, you have to move capital and it and extract capital from other areas through force, through military force, and that's the extension of imperialism through capitalism.

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       And then so you just go and now we're the biggest, most powerful empire controlling the entire world and we have to go after the last remaining sovereign quote unquote sovereign states to completely control. I mean, yes, other countries have done that before, but never on the level of what we're doing. If we could just get everybody to speak english and everybody to listen to us, we will be fine. We need to do is wipe out all the other cultures when you use a wipe wipe out all of them. We need cultural marxism. We just need a dictatorship. A one trump world. I was going to ask you, how do you feel about the. I feel like the level of discourse has gotten to the point back to the reactionary thing someone was telling me this last night, that the word responsibility, it's like you know, your ability to respond, the ability to understand a situation responded, not just react and I feel like so much of our culture is just reacting to news without even understanding what the hell is going on.

Speaker 2:          01:24:36       You know the, the twitter universe where it's just like you'd see something and you react and what? What does that do to critical thinking? What does that do to discourse when you do not understand issues or have the ability to respond that responsibility? Well, not only that, you be aged and dated by so much data. If you look at something, you're looking at a headline really quick. So many people have no idea what the article even says like we did like I did about that epa or you want me to hear that shit and you could be at a gas station right now talking to her friend. Remember that fucking government for shutting down database with the epa can't even get a hold of the information. That's it's crazy. We got to organize mean while you're not even reading. I didn't read it. I just told you about it. I had jamie pull it up and then we found out if it wasn't for jamie pulling it up, I would probably pair it out for a couple of days. Something would have had to. Somebody would have had to tell me on twitter, hey matt, it's a hoax. I would have. Otherwise she tweeted it, shit, it's a hoax.

Speaker 2:          01:25:36       There's too much coming at us. Abby. It was too much. We can't handle it. It's totally true. It's too much info and totally true. It's part of the whole thing with the internet is like these little 140 characters. Sound bites, you getting off twitter, but then the fact that it's coming at you from websites, it's coming at you from facebook, it's coming at you from instagram. It's just coming at you in a way that like there's no fucking way you can keep up with all this. There's no way, and that's part of what's going

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       on with people. Absolutely, and so there's. There's a, an embracing of anti-intellectualism that you're seeing now that I think is a response to that. I think people are scared and one of the things they're trying to do when people are scared, they do a couple things. One thing they do is flatter. There's little of that longing from back when they thought the earth was flat, flat. I get more fucking angry people online because of flat earth than anything I've ever done other than make fun of vegans. I think no way. Fluttered. There's an angry that you don't grow mad really? So everyday I get called the shill everyday. I'm around earth shell and they tell me, this is where it gets really hilarious. Your checks were being cashed, bro. I'm getting. I'm getting round earth shield checks. I get them in the mail was george soros.

Speaker 6:          01:26:58       George soros sends me $3 a month and I've been open about it $3 every month to promote the idea that the earth is round for the less than the price of a grand day. Starbucks coffee. I am willing to protest checks, man. Got to get a protest chest. it's so good. So good. Especially if you could send it to eat it like a whale sandwich. You'll spend your money on something terrible. You get that protest money and you spend it on something horrible to balance it out. You've been to Iceland, right? No. Awesome. It is amazing, but want to go just for the northern lights are so bad. the food's so bad because they only like whale horse while they have this pickle. This fermented shark supposed to be the fouls thing on earth and they love it. It's almost kind of like the moon where you're like, there's not even insects here, so you understand why.

Speaker 6:          01:27:50       Why do people live here bringing their stuff in boxes and barges and shit. Look, we have a plant before it spoils. They seemed like really cool people don't make it grow. Giants like they have a disproportionate number of like strong man winters that come from Iceland. Yeah, vice did a whole thing on them. They're fucking. He's enormous. Viking dogs that live up there. I know they filmed the son of the, of the game of thrones up there. It's, it's stunning. I mean it really does feel like a different planet. Isn't the mountain from there? The fucking guy who plays the mountain, that enormous strong man. He's like the world's strongest man. The mountain and game of thrones. That guy was switched. That dude's head. You have to close your eyes. One I didn't say who he was in st. There's one. Really? Yeah, it's awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:28:41       See, that's a good scene, but it's one of those. Whoa. That's one of the things I really love about television now. It's like people just fucking die like people that you really like, they die, you know? I mean sometimes it's great. Sometimes it's like when they killed glen with A baseball bat on walking dead. I was like, yeah, his bulging out of his skull right here. That's where I cut it off. Absolutely. This is a zombie show anymore torture show really as torture. Porn and the zombies are inconsequential. Yup. All of a sudden they're not scary like everyone just push them away and keep running and it's seven episodes of just dialogue of them walking around and it's like, dude, just compact this rogue one. I loved the new star wars movie, but everyone dies. Spoiler spoiler. Spoiled the fuck out of it. But I didn't.

Speaker 6:          01:29:35       I didn't see it. I want to see it. It just didn't. I'll tell you what I'm holding my breath for everyday. Life is downtime until the new alien movie comes out and does it create new alien, alien, May 19th, jesus christ to ad looks awesome. Ad for it. No. Oh, let's play the trailer and the trailer. Jamie. I haven't seen the arrival of the trip. They're not going to get mad at us. We'll. Yeah, they'll take it off. Take it off. We'll play it afterwards. Sits. It's so weird. YoU know, I had a conversation with somebody about this. If you guys react to it, we mIght be able to play it. So when we talked about, okay, well listen folks, we're just trying to sell your goddamn movie. I'm a huge fan of those and I think this is this and this. It's not going to be ridley, ridley scott.

Speaker 6:          01:30:24       I think it is really. I think this is really solid returns. She should know. I think it's a pretty cool thing. She isn't enrolled. I think that's the idea, but that was prometheus's a prequel to write. I never thought it wasn't good. it was to cgi. I was like, that's not a real dude. That's why star wars is so good because they finally bring back the cost. It's great. It's. It's not a lot of cgi, cgi, a lot of star wars. Oh, you're a woman and a fucking chinese transgender person. Like people. Here it is. Here's the official trailer. Go full screen. I'm just happy jar jar binks is out of the picture. Sucks. So you know what's fucked up. They like the old school man alien from the original one. The computers looked so clunky. I know what they thought were going to have for computers and what's his face here?

Speaker 6:          01:31:21       Mcbride? Yeah. Danny mcbride. Wow. Look at kenny powers. Isn't it so great. I've never seen him play a serious role. It's just looks so bad. This is nuts. Yeah. I don't know where they filmed it. They filmed a lot of shit in New Zealand. that's where they did the hobbit. New Zealand is one place that I really need to go. I keep hearing how amazing it is, but yeah, this looks good. No burns, no animals. It's like Iceland bitch. That's Montana. Okay. Don't be so fucking willing to see animals on the planet where you don't know what can eat shit. Damn. Shit's food. This is so cool. So it's like an a planet where the aliens are populated planet team of people that are going to go save human or something like that. Imagine you get paid to repopulate a planet. Sorry. We have to fuck to fuck for the future.

Speaker 6:          01:32:25       They don't know good. Don't get too close to it. Have you not seen these motherfuckers? I haven't seen nothing, but I just love when they do a movie like this and now they have these modern special effects. Totally. But they abused those things sometimes. One of the coolest things about the original alien was you saw very little of it. Exactly. That's the problem with all movies and tv now is you just see way too much. There's no buildup. Well, it's also a real fear comes from the unknown. exactly. You know, and glimpses like american werewolf in london. You only saw like a couple of titling flashes. Totally. And it was awesome. Whereas Stephen King movie called the laying of layers. It was. I was so terrified. I can't remember the last time I was watching a movie that I was so scared and terrified. And then at the very end, cgi like must've just come out. They show that lear and it's like, it looks just like this. It's like a black spot on the, on the screen here is the alien. The book is great. Oh, it's so good. Show what the actual can see the little guys up there and go, wow, that's what it looks like. That's so stupid. That's sad and it was creepy.

Speaker 6:          01:33:46       You get killed by. Look at it is that they really fly because he can't be real. Is real real? Was that a made for tv movie though? That's probably why I didn't have any money. And plus people that watch tv they feel like are still would have been better to have just like little puppets on a string though, but that would suck. Like if minions really killed you, like from despicable me. I felt the most like forced cultural thing I've ever seen the minion ad campaign here. It's because you don't have kids. It wasn't really popular kids. It was my kids love that. it makes sense. They love it. I thought it was just some weird forced on adults thing. Like you're going to love minions shit. I fucking love. And then like you get it. Oh that's right. It's coming out. So no, we did it. Yeah. Yeah. You haven't seen it. I just tried to watch it and it was like I as six hours hours artists and artists one, but the new one day they've shown it. It looks way creepier. It used to be to look creepier than used to be the picture show guy. Right. It was it. Tim, what thE fuck's his name? Was it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The one from the tv series. Well that was extremely scary. So that is that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       But there's some creePy images of it like where you see his teeth and shit. But uh, yeah, it was. What's his face from rocky horror? What the hell's his name? I've never seen rocky horror picture show. It's one of those. Yeah. The time just to take tim curry. Tim curry was the original it. He was the original clown. That's another great book. See, I feel like stephen king's movies all suck bad ones for sure. Not that they suck. I love Stephen King, but his books are so good that the books just don't. You just can't turn it into a movie. And like, like pet cemetery was so god damn creepy as a book. And then you see the movie like, oh, the cat's going to kill me. I'll fucking kill that cat. Let me get ahold of that care. If it's a demon. Katelyn grabbed by stupid little head.

Speaker 4:          01:35:54       I'm really excited for dark tower are both steven. Oh cool. But stand by. We're not superstitious or supernatural force or I think when he green mile as well, there was like a little bit of supernatural share with Michael Clarke duncan, but the thing is like when you turn his movies into something that you have to look at, like christine, they kind of pulled augustine as just the car, but it was even creepier in the book and then you get more, you know, you get more insight into the guy who created the car, was sold him the car. Super descriptive with his language and it really paints a picture that you can never do justice when you're watching it. Well, I'm excited for the dark tower series though, but do you know that the shining was very different than the book? I read the book. The book's very different and he redid the movie with his blessing and they use the guy from wings that a made for tv.

Speaker 4:          01:36:49       She was In it. I think tears. The bartender didn't work, but kubrick kubrick had a lot of weird shit in the shining, like there's a lot of references to the apollo moon landings as long as hidden shit in there hook story that said that he had like proven that the moon landing was false or whatever. Well, he definitely did a bunch of shit in the shining to pay homage to the apollo moon missions and some sort of a weird way. Like there was a. I forget, there was a bunch of different things that were there. First of all, the little boy wore a rocket. He wore look at apollo rocket sweater and then there was the number for one of the rooms that was the exact distance between the earth and the moon and there's a whole documentary that goes over in depth. The connections that kubrick made between the shining and the apollo moon missions.

Speaker 4:          01:37:40       It's fucking pretty intense stuff. Awesome. Yeah, and it was just a. It was a different book though. The book, the book was a slow build before jackets. Crazy. And then in the movie Jack Nicholson was like crazy already. He was like a little crazy and then it just got crazy and crazier. Whereas in the book he like slowly became more and more nutty and you bought into it like you saw him like getting taken by this crazy hotel and so he didn't like cooper x interpretation and that the, no, he didn't like, he didn't like that apparently. Which is too bad because it just, he just can't make a book into a movie, you know, like he, I guess he can but they're just not as good. You know? I hate people that say that though I'm saying it and I hate people that say that the book is the book we don't read anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:38:33       I think people will read. I hardly read anymore. I'm going to be honest with you. I listened to books on tape, hardly sit down and read them. I still read them a little bit, but I enjoy having someone read for me. That's awesome. But it feels like a fraud. Like when I say if I tell someone I read a book, I have to read some of the book to say I read the book right? Like, but I'll read part of it and they'll go book on tape and then I go, I read that book, but I didn't really read it. I only read like three chapters and the other 11 that had some actor read if you tell. But if you tell somebody, yeah, I listen to a lot of books on tape. Like, oh, you fucking moron. But no one's tried to have you write a book yet.

Speaker 4:          01:39:14       Oh yeah. I had a book deal and it was so brutal. Talk to the editor was so brutal. I gave them their money back. What was the book about? Just short a bunch of essays on things, but they wanted, this is what they asked me to do. They asked me to transcribe my standup once they were like, they read some of my writing because I used to do a lot of blogs and I used to put a lot of blogs on my website and I put them on online and some other venues. And um, they were like, hey, we want to give you a book deal and what's just write whatever you want to watch. Okay. Yeah. And then once you get some money from them, then it's like, we want you to write what we want you to write. And then they wanted me to write the.

Speaker 4:          01:39:52       One of the thoughts was they wanted me to take my stand up and transcribe it. I go, that's gotta be terrible. Bizarre. But they were like, george carlin did it, but jerry seinfeld did. I'm like, no, they took a check and you know, maybe they wanted the money. I don't know, maybe george had taxes city I pay, I dunno, I'm not doing that. And so they said, okay, well we want you to think that you want to get a laugh like onstage, like every 30 seconds. And I was like, well, I'm going to write about some stuff that I don't even think it's funny. And then no one does that when they're reading a book labs every 30 seconds. So I sent them a chapter and they edited it and changed a bunch of. Sheila changed the tone of it and I'm like, we're done.

Speaker 4:          01:40:29       I called my manager, I go tell them we're giving the money back. And they were like, are you fucking serious? I go, yeah, I'll give them their money back. I don't want to do it. It's crazy that they would actually change the language of what, how you would even write. I'm never going to do it again. That way if I do do it again, if I do write a book, I'm going to write a book and then I'm going to sell the book or I'm going to put the book online. If nobody wants to buy it, if nobody wants to buy it and turn it into a book, I'm going to go, okay, this is the blood your own. Now you can think it sucks, but at least it sucks. And it came from my head and my fingers like, I'm going to write it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:00       I'm going to think it. You can totally think it sucks and you don't want it that and look, there's just the reality of things is when someone creates something, it's gonna resonate with a certain amount of people and other people are going to hate it. Just fucking music that I think is terrible and people love it. They wait in line, they go to see these concerts that I just, you would have to strap me to a chair and prime my eyes open like clockwork orange for me to sit there and watch it and they can't wait. It can wait so tastes and and people's desires very. But as soon as someone who tries to enforce their ideas of like what you, how you should express yourself. To me, I thought of it as like very similar to stand up in the way that like if, if my standup, if somebody came along and was like, like some publicists that I didn't even know, not even a friend and wanted to edit my standup.

Speaker 4:          01:41:51       You can think my standup socks, you can not like it, but if as long as I'm actually paying attention to it, as long as I'm actually sitting there and I'm actually going over it and then editing it and in thinking about it myself and practicing and onstage, I don't want your opinion. I don't want your input. You either like it or you don't know exactly, but it's me. Right? No. Came out and it sucked. And then people would be like, you suck. You're like, no, it actually isn't me. It's this ghost writer and he sucks. But I think the movie has to be a collaboration, right? Like if you're doing a movie, you have actors, you have writers, you have directors, you have producers, you have the people that are giving you the money. That's got to be a goddamn nightmare because there's a lot of, lot of different cooks in that kitchen.

Speaker 4:          01:42:33       But that makes sense to me that you have to collaborate with these people. Like if you see, if you're playing some, some chicken, some movie, and you're, you know, you have this idea of how it's supposed to be. That's how you audition. But then you get on set and the director's like, abby, what I want you to do is play a chinese lady 1500. You're like, what? You know, you'd be like, but that's not what I got hired to do. Like what the fuck is this? Then you have this chaotic sort of struggle between the director and the producers telling you to act one way and it's a lot of nonsense that one of the pure things about writing, whether it's writing stand up or anything, it's like it's here's the world and here's, here's my vision, here's the world through my eyes and my fingers, and as soon as you allow someone to start fucking with that, I just think it's a recipe for disaster. So my experience wasn't good. Not that you can't have a good experience writing a book and maybe other people have, but everybody that I've talked to, the wrote a book tolerable. Yeah. That told me it was terrible. Everybody I know that wrote a book I have to talk to whitney about. She didn't have a bad experience. Get there. Go use that restroom. Every. Abby martin is my favorite hardcore lefty. I think she can't figure out where the doors.

Speaker 4:          01:43:49       She's my favorite hardcore lefty. She so rabid. She said, I want to get her in a room with sam harris though, because she hates sam harris and she thinks sam harris wants to fucking bomb every country where brown people live. She just takes things. She see how she ramps up. Like she wants to take things so far, like you can't even talk to her about like what social justice warriors do. She was like, she's not even thinking about it, that she's just like, yeah, but why? Why? Why? They're paying attention to that while trump is doing this and they're ready to bomb North Korea and yet, but it's still an issue. It's still something. There's a thing going on.

Speaker 5:          01:44:24       Yeah. It's hard to pick. Pick your thing. Yeah. One and be like you said so much info going on. Now. You get distracted from one, especially if you have a tinge of add. I do. Don't you? Yeah, will for sure. Who doesn't?

Speaker 4:          01:44:36       I don't trust people don't have add. You know, like you can concentrate all the time. I feel like one of those people that can really sit down and concentrate. Totally cp that Quick. That's the scene where you open it up like a bucket. How's that even possible? That doesn't even make sense with me. What are you saying jamie?

Speaker 5:          01:44:54       See the lambs being born outside of a wound. Did you set story going around today? That's the apocalypse silence and not like they weren't. They weren't a holy god made in there, but it waS. It's being tested on. I think it was sheep, like a premature births, so after a instead of a 37 week period, if it wAs like 28 weeks, they could put it in the sack and it was still growing. Hair eyes opened up. I'll show you the story real quick. Do you see that blowjob machine,

Speaker 4:          01:45:25       this new blowjob robot that they invented just for blowjobs one better than the the lip thing that you. What? What was it called? Flashlight. You have to actually move that thing around. Whoa. Look at this. Oh my god. Artificial womb successfully grew baby sheep and humans could be next. All my god, we're. We're lookIng at this plastic bag where this baby sheep is inside a positive lamb is growing in an artificial womb. For weeks, oh christ, what are we doing?

Speaker 6:          01:45:53       It seems like the next step that definitely try making one in a bag next to look in China, babies and bags and you probably already have a person that they've made and this is nUts. As soon as they started telling you about this, it's. It's already hAppened. They've already 20 years ago now and they're just showing us now is probably ivanka trump was probably born and raisEd in a bag. That's how we know chinese. Chinese still alive. That's why she's so pretty her. Right. They engineered their two sons. She came out perfect. They were definitely grown in bags. Well, he knows how to cook up a girl. Yeah, right. Like the. The genes work good on girls. They weren't good on her, that's for sure. Fuck his. Her husband Is gross. He's so odd. the video of him in Iraq or Afghanistan with the flak jacket on him. He's a preppy jaslin walking around. It's like gq, like endless war. Fucking

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       weird. Yes. Sick. Why didn't you give him like some military glows. What? like a complete douche bag. He looks like he's never worked a goddamn day in his life. Prep school, kid with a vest on soft hAnds. J dot crew. Yes. His hands probably tear on sand. Just irritated. Just being like, when can I come home, papa? Look at them. They're like, what a complete look kush. What is that? They don't even have good word. People that give you the afghans. No, that's. That is one of the most open secrets and and going back to why are we in Afghanistan? Yeah, come on. Yeah. Well why were we in Vietnam?

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       But the. It was one of the most open, like the information is readily available. Totally. The amount of heroin production that ramped up since we invaded Afghanistan. It's insane. Present and opiod latex as needed for pharmaceuticals. It's, it just goes on and on and on. It's completely obvious and it's going to come out soon. I think that that's really what's happening there. Do you think so? Absolute. how's it going to come out now? It's 15 years later. Good question. I mean it came out. Yeah. when did the sandinista, like when did all the cocaine trafficking stuff come out? We made an all over north freeway. Rupert. Yeah, exactly. I'm like rupert, totally. Such a tortured soul to him. He was such a tortured soul come in at times that god gave me mushrooms. Nice. He came on my podcast, brought me a giant bag of mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          01:48:36       Good man. Great guy. Good guy. Loved him. I didn't agree with. I didn't agree with them because he was. He was so crazy about so many different things about peak oil and stuff like that whole lung collapsed documentary that they did where they interviewed him and he's just sitting there smoking cigarettes, talking about the end is near. I'm like, jesus dude. Meanwhile, all these years later, everything's fine. Like he wasn't right about peak oil and a lot of the other things and he was always inclined to go towards doom and gloom, but I think that that movie, that documentary collapse and his worldview, it was a lot of it was based on how he thought of things because he was really depressed and just kind of an externalization of his own. He was depression, anyone up often themselves, so horrible. That was one of the saddest suicides of people that I knew when I knew that he killed himself because he is. He sent me some emails. We talked back and forth and he was. He was definitely like down in the dumps and I always felt like god man, like fuck, I just needs better people around him and he just needs more positivity, but he was so engrossed and entrenched in corruption and greed and all this stuff that you saw, but I'll never forget that fucking speech

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       when he stood in front of like. What was that? Lapd. yes. Well, he was an art was an lap narcotics officer and he stood in front of that cia guy and the. I forget what the meeting was about and he was talking about how he had witnessed cia agents selling narcotics and the ela and that they had been doing it forever and that he had been stopped from prosecuting and arresting them and everybody went crazy and nuts. It was nuts. And then he. He exposed the whole insider trading nine slash 11 stuff and peak oil and yeah, I mean he was just lambaste it as a conspiracy theory is toward the end of his life and it was really sad because he's done so many amazing things. That waS a, that was 1996 town meeting in los angeles on allegations and this is by the way folks pre internet and confronting the cia director and with the ball the way he did it. I mean he did it like clearly and loudly and articulately like it. Just play it so people who haven't seen it for my group are important.

Speaker 7:          01:50:52       Backing up a little bit below.

Speaker 4:          01:50:54       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:50:56       I will tell you directly as a former los angeles police, narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for me.

Speaker 9:          01:51:21       Obviously that is an answer for a lot of you. And now can you please. I refer now. Can you place I referred to, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker 10:         01:51:38       It was so boring.

Speaker 9:          01:51:43       Why managed care about it? If you don't like what's going on here, please leave now.

Speaker 10:         01:51:53       No, I haven't seen. I was trying to control what people are going crazy. I mean this was in south central.

Speaker 9:          01:52:00       Please take your states. I will get back to you as we rolled back across to the center section

Speaker 8:          01:52:09       director, deutsche. I will refer you to three specific agency operations known as um, a day as pegasus and watchtower resected by the agency. I was personally exposed to cia operations and recruited by cia personnel who attempted to recruit me and the late seventies to become involved in protecting agency drug operations in this country. I have been trying to get this out for 18 years and I have the evidence. my question, if he was very specific, sir. If in the course of the igs investigations and fred, his, his work, you'll come across evidence of severely criminal activity. It's classified well, you use that classification to hide the criminal activity or will you tell the american people the truth?

Speaker 2:          01:53:05       She's not the best at keeping this group together, but that was an intense, amazing god that opened up a lot of people's eyes. Like that was a very, very important moment. It was where people realized like, wait a minute is this guy. right, and then it turns out he was. I mean they really did sell drugs to fund these black ops and that's how they. That's the whole oliver north. That's the connection between freeway ricky, who I also had an apartment. I mean that's how he made millions and millions of dollars by selling the cia's drugs and that's how they funded the contract versus the sandinistas unreal. Fucking crazy. And you're telling me that this opium just leaving Afghanistan without being monitored or, or trafficked whatsoever. they must have done a way better job of keeping it together. They're like, look, maybe they learned something, not have another oliver north type deal.

Speaker 2:          01:53:55       Yeah, that shit ain't no good. I think Afghanistan to this, the only other country other than if I'm not mistaken, Kenya, that is actually not only the metadata, you know, like we're collecting metadata everywhere, but that is one of two countries in the world that wikileaks exposed that we're actually collecting every phone call. Every phone call is being archived and recorded from Afghanistan. So, which kind of adds to the weirdness that somehow these giant heroin, opium manufacturing operations going on and we still can't get a grasp on where it's coming from. Yet it really affects America. I mean, god damn. What is it like more than car crashes now? Our pill overdoses and opiate overdoses. It's nuts. It's just surpassed car accidents for the first time ever and insane. I had dennis mckenna on recently was explaining to me, yeah, it was pretty awesome. He's such a genIus man. He's so spooky. Smart. But he was explaining to me carfentanil, which is a new form of fentanyl that's even more powerful than fentanyl still scheduled to though.

Speaker 2:          01:54:57       Marijuana schedule one never killed a fucking human being ever that he was saying that the head of a pin contains enough for you to die of an overdose. Yeah. What? Why? Why would he do that? Why don't we make that easy? Because like hippos, we need a handout. They hurt. They have joint aches. His poor hippos. We have to figure out. We have to figure out how to to authoritarians brace for more overdoses after Maryland desa linked to elephants. Additive, yeah, horse tranquilizers now run elephant sedatives. I thought we were on ketamine and now we're on. Now we're on a. It's so potent to overdoses 10,000 times more potent and time.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       5,000 times more potent than a thousand times. Not like 110. That is so insane. This is why philip seymour hoffman and so many other people die of overdoses because the drug war and these people just sell like laced heroin and shit. And It's so dangerous and yeah, it's, it's absolutely horrible. When we were talking about bourdain's show, he had a great show on Massachusetts on cnn show and it was about the heroin epidemic that's hit Massachusetts and many other places as well. But he kind of talked about Massachusetts because, um, they, they had a few people that they were referring to where these people, they got hooked on oxycontin and oxycodone. I don't know what the difference is to, you know, um, and then they made it much more difficult to get. And then as soon as these people made it much more difficult to get.

Speaker 4:          01:56:36       You're dealing with these people that have addictions and so then they started doing actual heroin, so they're taking hillbilly heroin and then they get addicted to that. You know, if you have a back pain or you hurt yourself, they'll fucking write you a script for that shit. easy. And I have a bunch of friends that got hooked. I, I have a family member that just became a loser, was a hardworking guy, had his shit together, got hooked on those pills. Loser. Now no one talks to them. He's just gone his own fucking kids. Don't talk to them. Gone. And um, my buddy brendan, he broke his nose. They had them on that shit. And then three months later he's taking it every day, still his friends had come over his house and scoop it up out of his, um, out of is a medicine cabinet.

Speaker 4:          01:57:18       Addictive, scary stuff. Scary. And then you just need it. You just need it. I'll get, I'll get off it eventually, but right now I need it. Oh, I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was 17 and I feel like I got addicted to them that the doctor gave me. Yeah, I loved it. How could you not? I never did it. What's? Yeah, I never did it. I've got a knee surgery once and they gave me something. It was either percocets or viking and I cannot remember, but it made me so stupid. I remember thinking I would rather be pain. I'm pretty good with pain, but I'm not good with anything that makes me feel stupid beCause I feel vulnerable. Like I'd rather I'd rather be hurting and aware than I w I don't know, like a numb guy. I don't like numbing out.

Speaker 4:          01:57:59       That's one of the reasons why I like pot because it makes me hyper aware and hyper vigilant and really sensitive and, and it makes me, you know, people, you can call it paranoid. Some people call it paranoid, but I, I'm, I think it's more like hyperawareness, you know, in that hyper awareness you have to take into account all the variables that you are going to die, that you are in a, a ball that spinning a thousand miles an hour with a thin layer of gas, flat, flat, flat earth. No spinning, spinning around. Oh wait, just stationery. Yeah, everything's doing something around us. It's not. Whenever I hear the flutter thing, I'm just like, don't ask her not to take photos from space now or you can see the earth behind you live. There's a live you can watch from the space station. Anybody can soros. It's no cgr. It's a hologram buddy that I talked to you that believes in flutter at the show, that japanese satellite that takes a photo, high resolution every 10 minutes from 22,000 miles away, a full picture of the earth.

Speaker 4:          01:58:57       They think it's fake. That's all you have to say. It's fake. By the way. They keep saying that you can't fly over antarctica. Listen to me. You fucks. You can fly over antarctica. Can't fly government. Stop you from flying away article. They don't regularly scheduled flights. They fly over antarctica. Not only that, there's a quantas pilot who filmed it because he was tired of that bullshit. Mic west. The guy who runs the man who runs metta, bunk metabolic is a website designed for debunking conspiracy theories with facts and science. He's, they have many, many pages on the flat earth on that website of debunking all the arguments against flatter it. So he's going to come on the website and we're going to go over them. One, I'm going to die one. Some reason it's still growing. It's because me and my $3 a month that I take from george soros, my, um, my round earth.

Speaker 4:          01:59:54       How much you think they get paid you. If the earth was flat and you knew that the earth was flat, could they even pay you enough to not tell people? No. No. There's no way. There'd be no way. Think of how many people you'd have to tell or how many people you'd have to keep fire up the moon landing thing. Man, that's a cover up. The flutter thing. The moon landing at least happened in 1969 and it happened with a limited amount of people that were had access to all the technology. There was no internet. They controlled the media and we never went back. So there's all sorts of beautiful things connect together to form a nice juicy fat conspiracy that I love. I love the moon landings. I secretly not so secretly covered that one. Like no other conspiracy. I would love it if it was true.

Speaker 4:          02:00:42       Yeah, there's a, there's a great quote from bill clinton from his book, my life on the moon landing and it is, um, it's fascinating because he's talking about an old carpenter and he says the carpenter says that, uh, them mtv fellers that he didn't believe the moon landing and that those tv flow fellows, I never believe anything because they can pretty much do anything and make you believe that it's real and you don't. He goes, back then I thought he was a crank, but after eight years of the white house, I was wondering if he's not ahead of his time. That's in bill clinton's book series. You want to hear something really quick and people are going to go on with the moon. Moon. Are you good, bro? I thought you gave up on that. I will give you the most cryptic piece of information about the moon landing.

Speaker 4:          02:01:23       Neil armstrong gave a speech on the 25th anniversary of the moon landings and it is one of the most what the fuck speeches you'll ever hear in your life because it's not a guy saying, look, we went to the moon and it was an amazing. You kids are going to accomplish amazing things as well. Pull up neil armstrong's cryptics says she doesn't remember if there were stars, no known, but that is one of the things that they did say it wasn't neil armstrong by the way, it was Michael Collins had said that Michael Collins said that he didn't recall seeing any stars, but then later in his book he recalled in great depth what the stars looked like and how amazing they were and how incredible they were him later. But meanwhile he was in the lunar lander is whole time. So play this, play this

Speaker 1:          02:02:08       on the 25th anniversary of the event in 1994, neil armstrong meter rare public appearance and held back tears as he spoke. These brief triptych remarks before the next generation of taxpayers as they tour the white house. Listen to this

Speaker 7:          02:02:24       today. We have with this group of students some on america's best to you. We say we have only completed a beginning. We leave you much. That is under. There are great ideas. Undiscovered breakthroughs are available to those who can remove one of truths, protective layers.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       Is this a funny thing that happened on the way that the moon did? That movie is nuts. When they showed the apollo mission and it shows them like putting the piece of paper where it makes it look like they're farther away. I was like, what are they doing? Yeah, have no idea.

Speaker 4:          02:03:09       They're filming through a window there, filming the earth through a circular window and they have the cabin of the lunar module blacked out. They have all these things over the windows like a set and they using diffused lighting to operate the controls. It's crazy. It's so strange because it's the one conspiracy that still to this day you go home because there's no technological achievement from 1969 site easier, cheaper, and faster to reproduce today other than the moon landing is they went six times seven attempts, six to successful attempts. Apollo 13, obviously they never went. They did that accident that made tom hanks great movie, but that was the only time human beings have been more than 400 miles from the earth's surface. Every other gun back. Not only, we haven't gone back, we never even left the magnetosphere. It's crazy. We've never gone through the van allen radiation belts since then.

Speaker 4:          02:04:06       We never went into deep space like all the way out and back like around the Moon. They never even did like a fly by since then. That's insane how much it costs a shitload of money, but so does the space shuttle. So does the space station, so does a lot of things. He does cost a lot of money and that is a good argument, but it is weird that we still had a space program from it. This, it's like, look, I'm not saying that we didn't go, but what I am saying is that, that is why that conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          02:04:30       Totally. No, It's super crazy and that movie you can kind of go through and debunk the lighting stuff, the stars, the van allen radiation belt thing,

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       but then when it gets to that end senior, like, what the hell is going on there? It's nuts. It reAlly is creepy with that guy. He's very compelling. He was, he was all in that guy. The guy who made that movie funny thing happened on the way to the moon. This was when I was deep in the whole moon landing thing. Um, but there was a first one that got me is when I was on news radio in the nineties. They had a documentary on fox called conspiracy theory. Did we ever go to the moon? And that one is really compelling and one of the reasons why it's compelling us because there's more than one occasion where they used the exact same backdrop. They have the same backdrop, but they were supposed to be on a totally different part of the moon and they had the exact same background where it looks fake as fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:05:23       You want to see something really fake looking google astronauts on trampolines. You want to see some ridiculous shit. There's one one video clip did they did. Now here's what someone explained to me that it's entirely likely, and this made a lot of sense, that it's entirely likely. This is during the nixon administration, by the way. It was all going on. Massive deception. I mean nixon was just a fucking fraud in every way, shape or form and a crook and a liar. that it's entirely possible that they filmed a lot of stuff and that they filmed all this fake stuff and they passed it off as the real footage, but that they actually did go, but they couldn't get footage of it. And one of the reasons why they probably couldn't get footage of it, if that's the case, is that you can't even get that fucking film through the radar detector at the airport or the, the, um, the x ray machine at the airport without killing it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:11       Right. I was looking at some stuff up on this the other day, the van van van allen radiation belts, the spaceship itself and all the stuff they were wearing would've protected them from most of the radiation that would have potentially harmed them or anything that allegedly. And it's, it's uh, they also didn't go through what they went through, like the donut hole that's at the top. Like the way the van allen radiation belts apparently surrounded the earth. It surrounds it like a doughnut. So there's an area where you can go through. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well there's an area where you can go through with. They're only exposed to the radiation for like an hour or something like that. How, I mean with all this deception back in started from the beginning, look at this. So this is.

Speaker 4:          02:06:54       This is when I was balls deep, but look at this footage like what is going on here? Like what is this guy doing? So here's the thing, the physics back then they're. They're not the same on every mission, like the way they move around. It's not the same amount of palo 11 as it is on apollo 16 or whatever the last mission was that it looks different when they're moving around, but this one is the weirdest one because here these guys are, they're in one six earth's gravity and there's fucking juMping around through the air and you can't see their feet like you only see their feet when they're in the air. They just, they were hiding behind this lunar module and they're bouncing around in a way that you never saw

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       them bounce around before. That's not in any other moon mission. So I think it's entirely Possible that they fake some stuff and that there could have been an issue with them being on the surface of the moon. Yeah, and also being on the surface of the moon, the radiation on the surface of the moon, there was no protection to those cameras and there's no. There's no magnetos fear. There's nothing. Those hassled bad cameras that they had that they kept in the center of their chests. Those weird looking cameras that they used. There was nothing different about those. There was nothing protecting, protecting us when I was reading. Yeah, but not the camera. The camera was external. It was in the suit. This external. It was like this. It was out in front of them. Well, I don't know man. I just read that the pentagon spent like half a billion dollars on just fake isis videos and propaganda videos for terrorist recruitment.

Speaker 2:          02:08:21       What do you know why they did that though? That's. That's something that people bring up a lot, but it's a little misleading. what they did was they made these videos for real player and so when someone would watch these videos, they would collect metadata, so location the person was watching and that way they could find out who is watching these terrorists recruitment videos and they get it. You're right, you're right, but so is everything the government does and like if they want to try to figure out where isis was, they have unlimited money. I mean they can kind of do whatever the fuck they want. someone said, hey, I've got an idea. We'll make these videos while these terrorist recruitment videos and everything like that. The garland, Texas, um, that first isis attack and the us was really an fba. Once again it was an fbi informant to fbi informants were on the scene.

Speaker 2:          02:09:06       Why didn't they stop the attack ballou it guys. Right, right. Well, here's a better one, but they do all the time. How about that video that we were supposed to be led to believe was the reason why they attack bengazi? Remember that you remember? Oh yeah. I remember that fake video that was like, that was about the movie and everybody was saying everybody was saying that that movie was the reason why they attacked us, which was a lie. They knew it was a lot. They had a cia operation running weapons out of this hub, but they're like, oh, it's about a movie. Everyone hates this movie. Youtube. You're watched the movie now. It's fucking unbelievably bad. Oh god. I'm so bad that you don't even believe it's real movement. Seems like create that movie too. I would guess so. I don't know, but I would say probably.

Speaker 2:          02:09:55       I would say, yeah, I would guess thing that bothers me about the isis stuff is that, like I said before, that 70,000 number. It's like you could just say anything's isis. Isis gigs that we dropped them moab on and it's just like, oh, it's the nicest cave and that's why 70 percent of americans support bombing the shit out of Afghanistan because isis was there. What happened? I felt like there was more critical thinking that people were upset that we were playing judge, jury and executioner. I think now we just kill isis and mass and it's just no one questioned that at all. I think it's like what we were talking about earlier. There's just too much information. There's too much going on and the they bombed. They drop the mother of all bombs right after we had accidentally killed a bunch of people

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       that were on our side in Syria. Right? Yep. So like, that was like a good time, like we had accidentally fucked up and killed some syrian rebels and like, ooh,

Speaker 3:          02:10:43       didn't he kill it? Yeah. We killed a bunch of people that we were training in arming alqaeda and sees trump. And you know, what trump learned after the Syria strike, he learned that he can get because all he cares about, he's like a little child wants positive reinforcement and he hates, you know, the fake news. Cnn, why don't you, why don't you cover me fairly. He goeS out there and does these press conferences begging the news to cover him better because that's all he cares about. But that's what he learned is that he can get bipartisan support and praise from the media if you just bombed the shit out of people. So that's what he learns. So then he dropped the moab and what's next? Trump. Because you know now how to be popular, just like reagan came in and was, was seen as a joke until he got swept into the military industrial complex and became a war president and I think that trump came in as a reality star president joke and he's surrounded himself with more generals than any other president since world war ii and he's just letting them lead him wherever they want and, and of course general just want to be in charge of of conflicts so they can get more stars and emblems and honors and lead us into different things.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       That's theIr career to bring this up earlier. But I forgot

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       that was one of the things that was most creepy is that he's saying he's going to let the military do their job. Like, like oversight of the military is what eisenhower warned us about at the end of his term. I mean, remember when eisenhower was leaving, he talked about the military industrial complex and everybody's like, what the fuck? But that was something that was broadcast on television and back in the day, that's when it ended. It was broadcast on tv. Some people listened and then business went about as usual and it wasn't like today where you could watch that video over and over again. When you see that video, eisenhower saying military, we are industrial complex. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:12:24       Trump is now adding 10 percent of the fucking budget, cutting all of these agencies and bolstering the pentagon even more. We already have the biggest military in the goddamn world. Bigger than the next 10 countries combined. Why is this happening? This is whAt makes America great. Just reverting back to like a completely disgusting. It's sick, man.

Speaker 4:          02:12:42       What do we do, abby martin, what do we do? Well, okay, if president abby gets selected, what do we do?

Speaker 3:          02:12:48       Well, first, uh, abolish money in politics and start some sort of true democratic representation where you have simple laws to prosecute criminals. Whether or not they have money or they're billionaires. So if you're a corporate criminal, you got to fucking jail. If you pull it sounds like suicide by government. it's sick, man. I mean, I, yeah, it's, it's hard to say, but I just know that trump has taken us down a very dangerous path and these people who are thinking that he's somehow anti empire, andy deep state are very confuse. Bannon iS a psycho. Bannon wants war, he wants war with China, but it's naomi outs know the, I think that's just on paper because trump didn't like people calling him president bannon and so he's still attending the national security council. He still has a say. We know that he really is him and these billionaires, Robert Mercer in the koch brothers who have somehow aren't globalists, right? But they really are backing bannon and trump and they, uh, they hedge their bets band and tried to do it before with pailin, but it didn't work. he saw sarah pailin is like the trump one point zero and made this giant movie about her and try to latch onto her and then she flopped. She saw, sure what with pailin with ted nugent,

Speaker 6:          02:13:59       ted nugent's wife and kid rock and kid friendly. So creepy. Trump in the oval. This is idiocracy idiocracy. It's like a fucking bass pro shop video, a photo from a cabela's catalog. I mean, it's hilarious when you look at the five of them next to trump and when you were saying the military do your job, he's already like changed the rules of engagement where we look for kIlling a thousand civilians to be killed. A thousand civilians in martin.

Speaker 3:          02:14:29       Look at this. Yeah. Yup. Carpet bombed and area and mozal a couple of weeks ago killed 230 people. Didn't hear a peep about it from the mainstream media. Let's just move onto the next one. The photo then. Look, this is what's happening, but seriously, kid rock's girlfriends hot. She's hot as fuck. Kudos kid. You're hotter than I than him. That's great.

Speaker 6:          02:14:50       Sure. Of course. Where does this fear of pailin? Husband? No. Is that good? I don't even know what the hell he looks like. You don't know what it looks like. No, I don't want quarterly out of my periphery like I don't got a good hunting show. Sarah, sarah dinner kid. Just have another baby. That was her fault. Abby. Maybe one day you'll have promiscuous daughters and you'll understand, won't be promoted.

Speaker 3:          02:15:13       What's it called? Like how she's just a whole like, uh, she, she praises don't have sex

Speaker 6:          02:15:19       obstinance thing or who you're talking about. There was promoting. Pray the gay away. Was that pence? Yes. Pray the gay away. That's a, that's a good sign that someone's trying to fuck dudes. Oh, for sure. Right? For sure. I'm michele bachmann and her husband, everyone's forgot about her. I remember her husband who is maybe the gay guy that's ever walked the face of the planet. So gay guy comes glitter. Oh, gay. Like glitter and shoots out of his dick number. Last time I was, and

Speaker 3:          02:15:46       you showed me that dennis prager video, which was that it was an argument about Israel where he was talking about why Israel deserves to exist and stuff after being there. Man. Holy shit. I feel like people have no idea what. I didn't even know what the hell is going on until I went to palestine and saw how crazy it was. But what is it like? Tell me, give me your thoughts and your mistakenly thinks that hamas like controls palestine. That's not true at all. There's, there's three different areas that were drawn up with the original partition. It's the west bank, which is totally under military rule by Israel, and then there's the gaza strip, which is like the open air prison, which they bombed the shit out of like every couple of years and hamas controls that area. And then there's jerusalem, which is an international city center, um, that both arabs and jews live in.

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       But the westbank has been occupied militarily since 1967. And it's complete martial law. There's checkpoints. All political parties are illegal. You can't. having a gun is like the least of it. You can't hold a flag. You can't belong to a political party. You literally can't do shit if you're a palestinian. You just have to sit there and submit 'em. And if even if you share a photo of someone who was killed by an israeli soldier, you go to jail and you go to jail for the amount of, like months that. Yeah, based on the shares and likes of the photo, they'll, they'll penalize you more and put you in prison for longer and longer. I mean, I'll just tell you one story. Put a photo on social media like you put someone who died and there'll be like, you're sharing a martyr and inciting people to like commit suicide.

Speaker 3:          02:17:11       Like on behalf of palestinians. You go to jail and they put them in jail. There's a 99 point seven percent conviction rate. Kids are tortured, kids are in prison. It is absolutely insane. We went to the first day that we were there, we went to a funeral of some guy, some farmer who was shot by israeli forces and we went to the funeral is horrible, you know, all the women are wailing and crying and as relieving the israeli forces had set up a checkpoint right outside of this dude's house and started tear gassing and shooting rubber bullets. I get people who were simply attending the funeral just to punish people for attending the funeral. Um, we went to another girl's house named [inaudible] who's a, who got shot in the vagina for peacefully protesting at some protests and they shot, they shot, they shot 200 people that day.

Speaker 3:          02:17:57       One guy next to her diet, another guy who was paralyzed, they have a policy called shoot to cripple where they shoot guys in the dicks is fucking nuts, man. The west bank is no joke. I thought that I was going to die several times. We were at this checkpoint going through calandria and there was this old man walking like clearly drunk or something and kind of walking a little bit toward the checkbook. They started shooting at him. Bolts are ricocheting off the thing. And I, you know, my partner mike who was an invading soldier of Iraq was just like, we're gonna die like they're shooting this guy, there's bullets ricocheted. I. It was absolutely insane. And as we go through the checkpoint, the soldiers like, hey, stay safe out there. And I was like, yeah, when you guys are arbitrarily shooting people. And, and the person who was driving us had just told us that a couple months prior to that, some woman, palestinian woman, because you can't go to jerusalem, like if you're a palestinian, there's barely any palestinians were even allowed to go pray at the most holy site, the dome of the rock and jerusalem, you can't go to the beach, you're just completely constricted in a prison and you can't travel.

Speaker 3:          02:18:56       And, and he was just telling us that months before we went through this checkpoint, someone was going through the checkpoint because they got a permit to go into jerusalem, which is like a lifetime golden ticket, like willy wonka and they're walking and they get and she just got executed. And then yeah, she just got executed and she was bleeding out at this checkpoint. And her little brother tried to help her and they shot him too. And they're like hiding the video of this. And this is just a day because they fucking hate palestinians and palestinians are our animals to these people. It's sick, man. It's sick. It's really, really sick. Joe and I, I couldn't even get into. We were banned from going into this territory because I was told by the israeli government that I was a propagandist and that I was like an enemy agent and so I wasn't allowed to go into gaza, so gaza's hell, but the west bank is an under martial law and everything's illegal and you can't do a goddamn thing and it's super cool.

Speaker 3:          02:19:44       Like we went to this place called ramola that was just like, um, oakland and where they're smoking weed, there's like openly gay people. They're like, it's just completely different than what people think of palestine. You know, people think of it as just a bunch of people with turbans on blown and hamas is like, yo, you elected hamas and hamas doesn't want Israel to exist. It's like, well actually hamas is controlling this one area for a reason because it was built as this surplus. When Israel was created, millions of refugees were put miles away from the homes that they were ethnically cleansed from and put into refugee camps in gaza. And when the israeli military wanted more and more land, by the way, all settlements in Israel are illegal. All of them are illegal in the west bank, but they just keep creating more and more and more and we would go to these villages, have just arab people living in these villages and the settlers will come.

Speaker 3:          02:20:33       You have to be a fanatical fucking asshole to move from California to an arab village in palestine and setup a goddamn tractor trailer and just live on top of their home and they can have a giant machine guns. They can fire bomb you. They can shoot you, they can beat you up. They're protected by the state. You can go with a tractor trailer, set up a home. The state immediately runs a waterline of power line and a military outpost to protect you and the arabs are just sitting there waiting to get killed or attacked. It's absolutely insane and the way home demolitions worker in st louis because they either deliver a piece of paper with a rock over it and they're like, here, if you find it good for you and if you don't, then you're screwed. And that's if you're lucky. If you're not lucky, you'll just.

Speaker 3:          02:21:15       Your home will be invaded by settlers. And you'll be forced out of your home. There's videos of this all over the internet of like groups of settlers going and literally taking over arabs homes and then they just are forced out. It's crazy, man. It's, it's completely way crazier than I ever could have imagined. How long were you over there? For? A month. Yeah. Yeah. And we were, you know, we were simply and people want to quabble about like, oh, it's not apartheid. There are different fucking license plates for arabs and jews, like you cannot go to areas like israeli soldiers were arbitrarily set up checkpoints in just shut you out of your neighborhood and force you to walk three miles to your home. Like they can do whatever they want because you are under martial law and you can't, you have no mobility, like you have no freedom.

Speaker 3:          02:21:58       so it's really, it's really bad. And we just did a whole series on the empire files talking about how Israel was created up until today. And we go over like the settlements, the demolitions, the jail, and why I think there's no hope from within israeli society to change because it's becoming a more theocratic state and a more fascist state as it grows because you have to be. To maintain this jewish supremacist state, you have to be like more fascist and more controlling and more militaristic and the way that you rule society just like the us. I mean people who are conSidered outlier, fringe assholes 30 years ago are now like the christian evangelicals are now in power. It's really, really crazy. I mean it's not the same because Israel is a white nationalist, ethno supremacist state and you see the way that they treat ethiopians and african refugees and, and it becomes obvious that even if you're a jew and you're black, you still are a second class citizen there.

Speaker 3:          02:22:55       Have you interviewed anybody that's pro Israel to interview a lot of israelis? And what did you. I interviewed a lot of israelis. It seems like a lot of israelis. Well, think about this in order to really reject the notion like you, it's like rejecting being an american and it's such a hard thing for people to really accept. So there's a huge mobilization within Israel. People who are opposed to the military who talk openly about how awful the occupation is, how brutal it is, how they, you know, all the crimes they committed, but you'll very rarely find anti zionists who will come out and say that the notion of a jewish state is wrong because then it means you're just rejecting everything that you are and like, who are you then if you're an israeli and you are not zionist, you know, it's like, it's just a really hard notion for you to wrap your mind around.

Speaker 3:          02:23:41       But we interviewed about 40 israelis, man on the streets and, and to be leftist as a slur. So like a lot of israelis don't even entertain the notion of, oh, maybe there shouldn't be an occupation at all. They're all just like, okay, well maybe we should have a more humane occupation. Maybe we should give them water. Like maybe they should have their own water. Saying the occupation, occupation of palestine. So the west bank of the west bank has been militarily occupied for since 67. So when Israel was created in 48, there were those three partitioned to areas that I talked about and ever since that happened, Israel has just continued to take over more and more land in the west bank. so these settlements just keep growing and growing and growing and growing. Um, and so, you know, over time there was mass resistances that happen and then in 67 Israel was like, we're just gonna do a large scale invasion and try to take over all the land and then they just stayed and occupied this area and they just had been there ever since.

Speaker 3:          02:24:34       And so that's like the huge international crime when the international community is like, by the way these settlements are illegal and we're like condemning you at the un and the us just vetoes it every time because the us is just like boys with Israel unconditionally. It's sick man. And then they just sign that $10,000,000,000 aid package given it to Israel for the next 10 years is I actually, I think it was $30,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, which is crazy because this would never be able to happen if it weren't just completely supported by the us. And why is this us? I don't know. Um, I think that the us loves using Israel as a military garrison. They love usIng that strategic point in the middle east to have. Um, and also someone was shedding some light. This israeli soldier that I interviewed who was amazing, his name is ronna ferrante and he was telling me that the military aid package that we just signed with Israel, it may look like just a gift.

Speaker 3:          02:25:26       Israel were like, here's $30,000,000,000. But he said, really what it was doing, Israel has been its own arms dealer it, it actually is one of the number number one weapons dealers in the world now. It actually did like this huge deal with India. And so the us felt threatened, right? Because we're the military might. And so we kind of locked in Israel with this giant packet and we're like, you have to buy us armaments through this, so if you accept this $30,000,000,000 a deal, you have to go through our military like weapons to buy if you want this money. So that's what this guy was saying. He said it's actually a gift to us that we're locking down like our control over this country. But honestly it's becoming so unpopular. Obama had a big feud with netanyahu. I mean, trump is disgusting because jared kushner is personally invested in illegal settlements.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       And he like his boys with netanyahu financial. Yeah. The cushner foundation. Like his family, his actual foundation has funded illegal settlements. But if you fund some charity in gaza, you will go to jail for supporting terrorism. But you can go fund the legal settlements and sponsor settlers to go and live on top of arab villages. And that's fine. I guess that's freedom. Do you think that most people just aren't aware? Yes. I didN't even know. I had no idea how crazy it wasn't for a while. and I a pc. You were criticized about on your show, were you, you were furious about, oh my god. Yeah, and people are just, it's so confusing and convoluted on purpose because that it really relies on Israel being the victim and for people not really understanding that palestinians are not all terrorists and that it's really just a case of being occupied and like getting freedom.

Speaker 3:          02:27:07       So it's, it's really tough man. But a lot of these israelis want, they just want to push the palestinians. They wanted, they want them to go, they want them. They don't care as long as they're gone, as long as they're gone. I mean, here's an example of how crazy it is. El rosario as a soldier there, you know, and in the us, when police kill black people and we have rallies like black lives matter, people have rallies in support of these people who get killed in Israel. They have mass rallies, 10,000, 20,000 people strong in tel aviv. If a soldier executes and unarmed palestinian man and gets a slap on the wrist. Like this guy leo rosaria executed an unarmed palestinian. It was on video. It's a horrific video and because there was this international uproar about it, Israel had to put him on house arrest.

Speaker 3:          02:27:56       The israeli government put him on house arrest and that was enough for like mass mobilization of tens of thousands of people to come out and protest the fact that he was getting even reprimanded as slap on the wrist. They get house arrest, video available. Absolutely, and they're chanting death to arabs. There's tens of thousands of google and look up dan cohen and david schien. They do aMazing journalism there. They were living that. David jean is israeli. He's. He's been there and he documents these crazy rallies, fascist fucking rallies that no one else has shown and until I saw that until I saw People chanting death to the videographers because they hate when you even film like what's going on there? Death to the leftists. A really scary man. It's just a completely different society. Here it is. Here it is. Nuts. It's a long videos. It was just the two of them. That bro skis. Yeah, go forward until you see this. Just like crazy.

Speaker 6:          02:28:52       We're being criticized all over the world is if they are righteous, killed for less than the United States is the worst. They bomb pop, so she's basically saying, how dare you criticize us when you guys do this shit, which is a good point. Just the war policemen, usu blacks, and it's okay because the whole circus, the world per se, that israeli army are really murderers. We gave them an official license to call us murderers instead of covering it up and dealing with it ourselves. Why make so much noise? Whoa. Instead she's pro covering it up. Once a soldier understands that he can be charged with manslaughter next time he'll think twice, and that hesitation is likely to cost soldiers part of this. Wow, this is interesting. Our brother lr, so everyone's cheering on the soldier were certainly now sitting in an open jail, an army base in the center of the country watching tv.

Speaker 11:         02:29:52       The kid will pay, but then at vizio, he's in at all

Speaker 6:          02:29:58       look alone, a law. The jewish people support you. The jewish people are with you and he's about to say, jewish people did not abandon their soldiers started to chant death. They're present or the future.

Speaker 7:          02:30:17       Whoa.

Speaker 6:          02:30:19       you are not alone.

Speaker 3:          02:30:26       They're mad because they're all tight. Summary execution is like an institutionalized thing, so they're all like, why the hell is this guy getting persecuted for something that everyone just acknowledges that this is

Speaker 6:          02:30:38       so the soldiers have to be in their eyes, so just have to be able to just execute anytime they want. Go to that, go to that huge rally at the end. Do you think that they feel like trapped and surrounded and that they make this justification because they feel like there's arab states all around? Oh my god, they have a fucking concert, so yeah. No, that was wearing adidas. Don't. The help of god was really shoulders would return home peaceably. No hope of god. All Terrorists will be neutralized. Go to that part. Yeah. Go to their flowers in the gunbarrel israeli national. Yeah. Where it shows the

Speaker 1:          02:31:18       thank you for coming good and told her respect part in this video. people should watch it where it says, yeah, we'll flip the country over free. The boy debt. The arabs Were, does it?

Speaker 12:         02:31:26       That's the hard part. Come in.

Speaker 6:          02:31:31       so how did these guys get away with film? And this is the king of Israel.

Speaker 12:         02:31:38       The dog.

Speaker 1:          02:31:42       yeah, it's really great. It's very intense. I mean, yeah, of course israelis are indoctrinated. I dunno, it's a 10 minute video, but it's part of the, when the giant rallies, we have it in our videos too on the um, on empire files. Yeah, it's really wild. We didn't want to vote ultra right square, full the squares for. Because he's saying that the establishment makes it seem like an arab as a son of a whore, a jew as a soul.

Speaker 12:         02:32:07       Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:32:11       His friends asked you here, embarrassed. They don't want this on film. We only came to embrace and love the army and the soldiers. He's trying to change the football club. Yes. Anybody? No, no. This isn't about killing. ARabs were about celebrating the army. Anyway, there's some really crazy stuff like my friend david, was it listening to terrible music.

Speaker 6:          02:32:33       Oh god. Fucking sick of waiting for peace. I will know her on their dream about it until I die together with this holy crowd. I utter a prayer. Jesus christ, like we would go in there

Speaker 1:          02:32:56       huge jerusalem and tel aviv and people be like, are you arab? And I'm like, what? Like they just immeDiately just have this distrust and hatred for arabs. It's extremely intense and like you were saying, I mean this is the thing that starts from childhood. You are indoctrinated to think that every single person is trying to kill you. So all these people or these kinds of film this, they're kind of fucked now they, they've been jumped. My friend david shane was junk because someone came up to when he was like, where's your fucking flag? Because you like were israeli flags as capes. A lot of these people like wear them. It's extremely fascist and he was just like my flag. And they're like, yeah, where's your fucking flag? And they'd beat him up, took his camera. And this happens all the time. I mean they, they luckily he's an israeli jew so he doesn't get that much heat.

Speaker 1:          02:33:40       But my friend dan is also, you know, it looks like a, he is a jew, so they don't really give him heat, but like yeah, it's really dangerous to film there and it's really dangerous to document what's going on. They must be particularly furious about israeli jews that expose this stuff. Oh yeah. There are definitely targeted. Yeah. It's dangerous for them to be in the country for sure. That, that really ruthless patriotism. Right? The woman was saying that the soldiers might hesitate if they can be charged with manslaughter, you know, to move. Yeah. It's pretty intense. So I feel like, yeah, the whole Israel

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       thing and people are confused about like bannon and this antisemitism thing. Look, you can, you can hate jews and love Israel. Just like Richard Spencer is a perfect example. Richard spencer sees Israel as the perfect example of what he wants the us to be because it's an ethnos supremacist nationalist state and that's what these people love. So you can be anti semitic and still love the notion of fostering like a certain group, a certain identity.

Speaker 4:          02:34:46       so does, does he think we should have mel mandatory military service or they do it?

Speaker 3:          02:34:50       Well, he, he definitely doesn't want different races breeding so I think that he probably just wants like an insular society. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:34:57       I'll just like white people. She is christ nazi-ism when when you get a bunch of people and everybody has to join the army. He, he, there's a disturbing. There's a bond that they have. It's very different than the regular civilian bond and the like the indoctrination that you get once you've been in the military and you fought side by side with your brothers and sisters in arms. So until a totally different feeling, you know, I know, I know a lot of people that have been in the military and some of them got deeper in it than others and like those people, like it's almost like an us versus them. Their society that know that whole chris kyle sheep dog thing. right. You know, like there's there protecting us, but they together as a group are much tighter than any other group in the United States. I mean there's, there's division in all groups. Right. But I got to imagine that the bond that they have as israelis, all of them have been, been in the military, all of them living in this one small area surrounded by arab states. It's got to be super intense. They should've created Israel, not in the god damn middle of the middle east. Put it in fucking Australia. Like what the hell were they thinking isn't about the history of that region. But was it mean sikes, pico,

Speaker 3:          02:36:21       western empires. You basically just drew a line through the middle east and divided all these countries and formed all these borders back like 120 years ago. I don't know, like 19. When was sex pico? I don't know. Somewhere around that time. So anyway, fast forward to when the ottoman empire was colonizing this area and the british were occupying what is palestine, right? And the zionist lobby was really strong. This is well before the holocaust. And they were super, super strong and embolden and they were negotiating with the, um, with the brits about where they can form like a jewish state. And there really was no support until the holocaust where they were able to sell, like, you know, the fear more and there was even false flag attacks were zionist organizations were going around different arab countries and committing terrorism and insane, like, all right, like the jews need to come and escape that you guys are being persecuted.

Speaker 3:          02:37:13       Like they would actually carry out terrorism, it like and stuff. And thiS is all documented. Yeah. But the ethnic cleansing that went on, I mean, it's horrific. There's dozens of massacres that happened in the formation of Israel because even though it was partitioned initially by the un, I don't know who, who gave like this international body, the authority to partition a country on top of another country. But on top of that, um, there was several massacres that just continued to take more and more of the land as I said. And since, and that was called the noc button. So all these people were expelled violently and purged From their lands. And we visited some of these refugee camps and the people were just like, we literally, our houses are like five miles away and we're just stuck in these camps and we've been here for 50 years.

Speaker 3:          02:37:57       Yeah, it's sick. And they have. And they have like no water. They just have one water tank every month and israeli soldiers will go and spray skunk spray, which is like a military manufactured, disgusting, toxic tasting spray that sounds, that's like tastes like sewage water. And they'll just go target these water tanks and then your water will be fucked for the whole month. There's just little things like this just to make people's lives a living hell. Now. Did you film when you were over there? Yeah, we have tons of. We have tons of data. We have what? We have four episodes out where we, you know, I go to anti-refugee rallies and I'm talking to people who are telling me that these people are subhuman infiltrators. You need to be executed and rounded up and put in chains. It's all on film. I mean it's, it's, it's really crazy and I.

Speaker 3:          02:38:44       You really don't understand how bad it is and why it's so dangerous and how really it's been the crux of so many problems in the world, especially in that region, like what we've done just to create this settler colonial state in the middle of the middle east and expel all these people violently and then just unconditionally support Israel. No matter what war crimes they commit, no matter who they bombed, no matter who they kill it sick and people don't respect us for doing that and it's super hypocritical. When we're engaging in military operations in the name of fucking morality and humanitarianism. Why do you think do openly support Israel to where they do? It's really weird to say like, why do we support Saudi Arabia to Saudi Arabia has oil. There's some logic to connect dots. They're really simple. I don't believe the whole zionist lobby controls the us.

Speaker 3:          02:39:30       I think that it's a partnership. I think that the us sees a lot of leverage having Israel there, but I think it's becoming more unpopular where it's almost becoming a liability because the rest of the world is increasingly realizing how fucked up the situation is and trying to boycott like the state, you know, and, and the us is, it's not going to be a popular thing. Like even when obama was leaving office, he did that kind of cursory like superficial thing where they for the first time didn't veto Israel or didn't veto like the condemnation of israeli settlements. And so that was like, we didn't not do it but we just like didn't veto it for the first time in a long time. And that was a huge slap in the face to Israel even though it was like nothing but just as symbolic empty gesture. But that kind of obama's like

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       fuck you as I was leaving, but it really didn't do anything. But it's just, it shows you that there's a lot of divisions, I think from the inside. And I think the government is realizing like it might not be worth it. Um, if the pressure continues to, to mountain, I mean we need to put pressure on our government to stop this occupation because it's completely inhumane and disgraceful. So you said you have four episodes of this that are outright four episodes and we're putting more out. We're putting the episode with all the interviews with israelis next on empire files on our, on our show, on youtube. Is it just, that's the name of the channel? Yeah. So empire files is the name of the channel. And then if you go to the empire files.tv, we have all of our archive on there that you can check out.

Speaker 1:          02:40:57       So is this all your stuff now? You're doing this all completely independently? Yup. That's intense. It's really intense. Yeah. What is it like being your own boss? Now? Hard because I really love smoking weed and not procrastinating so it's really hard to like get shit done and then I'll be like, oh man, I need to put all this together. So it's like just totally. Me and my partner just kind of have a deep sense of responsibility really into somewhere like this and drop this kind of footage. Yes, definitely. And we also went to the amazon and and saw the mess that chevron left there, like an 18 billion gallons of oil just festering in the amazon jungle that's just been left real. YeAh. And they just lied about a bunch of pits and never cleaned it up. And so we went and I was like standing in the soil pit and I was like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 1:          02:41:44       Everyone's dying of cancer. I mean it's a whole nother level when you're, you know, you're not just reacting to the news and giving commentary. Like we were saying before in a studio, you're going there and it's like the truth is in front of your face, just the first time you've done stuff like this. Yeah. So you just felt like when you were on our t that you were kind of shackled by being in the studio and to really get a feel of these subjects that we're covering. Because I'm really emotional. I wear my heart on my sleeve and it, you know, it's a detriment. Very fiery. Sometimes it's a detriment, but I, I, you know, I wanted to go and really be there. I feel like I need to be connected to the, to the people I'm talking about and kudos to you for doing that.

Speaker 1:          02:42:23       Thanks. I'm going to wash this stuff. I'm going to watch. Check it out man. I will. And so, empire fire arrows on youtube. What do you have coming up? So coming up we have um, we're going to Venezuela. Venezuela just fell apart, right? It's a dictatorship right now. Did you hear they, they took over the gm plant. Well that wasn't the government actually that came out that it was not the government that did that, But yet I don't know if they issued a correction. That was not a real story. But yeah. No, it's not such a mess. There are massive. I mean, can you imagine if like, oh my god, I don't even know, like millions of people from both sides are out. Just fighting in the streets. Like it is the craziest going there to report subtle shot. I know it's scary. It's scarier. Like 30 people have died already, but. oh fuck. You know. But I feel like we need to go and shed some light about what the hell is going on.

Speaker 4:          02:43:17       Gem fires. Two thousand 700 employees by text message after Venezuela plant seizure. We all received a payment and a text message there no longer anyone in the country. What does it go down? Wow. So they just took over the company. They just took over the spill that. Wait a minute. Who's saying so what is it? What are they saying here? Local government is part of the south american countries. Ongoing economic, political and social crisis is being seized by the local government illegally.

Speaker 1:          02:43:52       I swear to god that I saw this story retracted, but who knows? Maybe this is the dr. Com. This is just a car site. It's like sponsored counter reported that thing. It was looked like they were big. Abandoning it for awhile though. They've abandoned it for awhile. Gm was going to abandon it over like. No, I'm just kidding. I mean, it's a total mess.

Speaker 4:          02:44:12       According to rotor routers report on monday, it looks like general motors is abandoning Venezuela for awhile to employees, told routers that giant employee plant's employees were all fired via text message, blah, blah, blah. Corporate email accounts were all deactivated over the weekend. We received a payment in text message. The size of the payments was not disclosed, were not disclosed, but according to the union leaders, they were too low. Of course unions never said they paid us perfect. Everything's great.

Speaker 1:          02:44:41       We're psyched. Yeah, man, it's gonna be, it's gonna be crazy. Bach.

Speaker 4:          02:44:45       So Venezuela essentially is now some sort of a dictatorship,

Speaker 1:          02:44:51       right? I don't think so. I think that that happened. Well, I don't know. Um, I don't know. Uh, no, not until you get there. Well, I've been, I think that there's just a lot of misinformation out there just like there is about every country that, you know, rex tillerson just announced that we want to install another regime in Venezuela. Chavez was a, was a target from the us empire for a long time. So I just really take everything that I read with a grain of salt, especially in light of all the serious stuff. I just feel like we're in a really heavy propaganda war. Um, you know, you look back in the queue when we actually removed hugo chavez from power for a couple of days, the New York times was praising it, being a distinguished business businessman took over, like, you know, not mentioning like the us was behind all of this. So I just all the media talking about, you know, it's a dictatorship and, and this is a pro democracy movement. I don't doUbt that there are millions of people who want maduro gone and they have val absolutely valid things to say and there's a lot of fucked up things about the country, mismanagement, corruption, et cetera. But I'm going to go there and try to find out what's going on. If you want

Speaker 4:          02:45:58       get a chevy volt for $29,000, the only way you do is you got to get those vent as well and people to work for a dollar a week. So unless you've got a better idea, how about you? Fuck off.

Speaker 3:          02:46:08       Wait how greatest trump's economic plan, he's like, just give corporations giant tax breaks and all the jobs will come back here. You're like, waiT. Corporations already have giant tax breaks and they're never going to fucking come back here unless they can pay people ten cents on the dollar like they do in Bangladesh. How is that a plan

Speaker 4:          02:46:24       or China? I mean, what were our phones? You know, I mean the foxconn companies don't have nets around the, the buildings because the job's awesome. They have nets to keep people from killing themselves. That's extremely disturbing. I mean that's the only way you get people to make a cell phone. This, that cheap. We've reviewed it like we went over the numbers of like what a cell phone would cost if you had it made in America and you gave people a living wage. It's like more than double. Yeah. I feel like you. I would pay that if I knew that I waSn't using conflict minerals, but conflict minerals and the least of your concern, because this is just american labor conflict minerals. It's going to. There's one company that was making an android phone that was like karma free phone or something like that. Wasn'T it?

Speaker 4:          02:47:09       Something like along those lines, but everyone's like, how good. The camera had only had like three g. It was like a test of how much. How much do you care? Fuck. three g, five g is right around the corner. Okay. You got to step up your game. Karma phone. By the way, judge. You know how many emails I get from dude saying I listen to you in the joe rogan show and you are horribly unbecoming. Swear too much. You're not a lady. You need to stop swearing. And it makes me think what and would what a female ever be able to win any political office if a tape came out of them saying, I grabbed men by the deq. Yeah, that's my kind of gal. What if. What if I looked like trump? Oh no, he didn't have like all that loose skin. But if you look like you, but like, yeah, go pussy riot.

Speaker 4:          02:48:00       That was pussy riot. Girls are cute, you know, that's why it works. Yeah. You know it's true. I mean, look, there's a, there's a lot of shallow thinking. Yeah, in, in pretty much every part of the world. I mean human beings are involved in this weird sort of a race for, for resources and for breeding rights and for, you know, for social, social position. There's a lot of weird shit going on with people and we're, we're, we're like in some weird stage of evolution where we're, we're close to like getting better than we are now, but we're not there yet. And the trump thing is like a little slide back. The longing for nostalgia, you know, we've kind of slid back a few steps but I always feel like my, I mean my take on things is always that unless there's some sort of resistance, the real hard work doesn't get done and I feel like this, this situation that we're in right now, which is really unappealing to a lot of us is going to force people to activate politically, socially and gas. And also I think

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       like this berkeley shit that's going on these riots and everything is going to force people to reexamine the way they interact with each other. Like this is not the functional way, this is not a good way to interact. And that's where I think we were talking about like what's important about this, um, regressive left ideology and addressing it and say it's important because it fuels the right, it fuels these alt right people to have some sort of regressed. Like literally what the outright to based on the notion of. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it really is. Listen, you're awesome. I always love. I always love having you on this time. I was like, I need to say more things now. It's really depressing and clinical prime. Debbie martin and he didn't say shit about sam harris, so won't send me any horrible text. Would you ever get together with him?

Speaker 2:          02:49:55       Would you ever do a podcast with him and talk to him? He's a very reasonable guy. I swear to god he is. I mean, the thing is that is his followers are just so crazy hidden, sort of not like not like his man. I mean, wow, I'm sure he's a nice guy, but dance, I think he feels like you misrepresent what he says and then he presents it. I say. I mean he basically, his whole argument was, was tearing apart me tearing apart official military data and statistics, which is complete bullshit. Anyone who believes the military and pentagon statistics come on, you don't think they fucking let you think that 70,000 numbers. Correct? Well, they only got a few civilians. It was a little surgical. I understand. Look by a lot of my friends love sam harris. They love his philosophy 100 percent, but when it comes to politics that you know, there's a different jive. I think it'd be funny having two guys go out at though. It wouldn't be funny. Be interesting. It'd be. It'd be interesting. It'd be funny. Interesting. What'd you do it would you be doing about it? I'll think about it. No pressure. I'll think about it. Pressure. It wouldn't be fun. It actually would be fun. Well, I'm glad you're back. It was fun. I enjoyed it. Martin, ladies and gentlemen, the empire files. Check it out on youtube. Uh, we'll be back tomorrow with my pal dan dodi city.
