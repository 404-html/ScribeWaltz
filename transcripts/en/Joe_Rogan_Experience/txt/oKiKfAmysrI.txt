Speaker 1:          00:00:00       No, it just seems the problem with the marijuana is five, four, three, two, one. Dennis Mckenna, ladies and gentlemen, before we were just discussing how I was saying that marijuana can be your friend and it can enhance your life, but if, if you take too much, it's such a seductive little creature because a little bit of it as like, Oh, this is nice, this feels good, but if you get too crazy, especially if you get too crazy with edibles, it'll take you and take you away on this wild journey of paranoia and, and, and you'll, it'll lock you up. Like some people just need to take a couple of weeks off, just relax. That's always a good idea, right? Yeah, yeah. I think people underestimate cannabis. I think it can be like, hey, couldn't really sort of knock you off your center, especially if it's edible and like all these things, you got to learn how to use it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Yeah, I mean it's basically that's what you gotta do. You'll have to learn how to use it, but you know, you know, that's my raps rap, but it's a great wrap. It really is. It's so important. It's, I think it's so important for people to realize that he got to let like regular you, like you like natural sober you. It's important to be in touch with that. Like you don't want them always be high or always be caffeinated or always be anything like. Exactly. I mean we're, you know, people get, you know, to these places and they fail to do a reality check on themselves, you know? I mean, I get emails from people all the time so. Well I'm, you know, life's been pretty weird lately. I took mushrooms five times last week and it's like, dude, how about you lay off for a while and give her a chance because you know, they tell these stories.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       It's like the idea of, okay, let's find your center. Go back to baseline layoff, the sauce, whatever it is you're taking and just chill out. I'm trying to rediscover your center. It seems like common sense advice, but people don't do it. Does he? My common sense advice but common sense is not common. I think everybody knows that. Yes. All you have to do is look around, realize what is it about people though that one thing, dosage in any sort of a minute, it doesn't even have to be a substance. It can be an activity like gambling for instance, like once it gets in your bones, it just seems like you're so compelled to just continue that behavior and and the idea of stopping is almost more painful than the idea of wrecking your life. This, this, this, this, this addiction. This is basically these things are reinforcing. They activate those pleasure circuits in the brain mediated mainly through dopamine and all of these. I mean the, the so called drugs with abuse, which I think is a terrible word, terrible, but

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       you know, the reinforcing drugs, the pleasure drugs work directly or indirectly through the delta circuits and the dopamine is like your, your button for pleasure. You know, in the same way that Serotonin is kind of on the opposite side, it's your button for more like euphoria, feeling good but not the. It doesn't have the punch. I guess that the, which is why people can get addicted to gambling. They can get addicted to sex, they couldn't get addicted to television. All of these things. It doesn't have to be substances because they all hit those same circuits, you know, except the psychedelics which don't work on that reward circuitry. They work on a different set of circuits, but yet even with those you are behavior patterns can become addictive and then you can start just doing psychedelics too much and it's not even the psychedelics that are doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:53       It's just this compulsive need to constantly change your state of mind. Oh yeah, that's quite true. And if people, you know, the way they use psychedelics is, is there are many ways to use it, but basically use the thoughtfully, you know, I mean you can all the question about recreational use versus spiritual use versus therapeutic use. I mean these are all ways to approach it and I am not a person who says you must do it this way. You must do it that way. What I do say is do it from an informed place and do approach it thoughtfully. No, because I mean, in other words, don't you know, planned for it. Respect the medicine in a certain way, you know, use it in a circumstance where you can learn from the medicine rather than have the medicine be sort of a, you know, overlay a but over whatever else you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       I mean this is something that demands attention and I think that's the best way to use psychedelics and for whatever, you know, whatever spin you put on it is that spiritual as a therapeutic is a recreational as Shamani. These are all labeled. The important thing is that, you know, you have the, you approach the medicine itself. The medicine is the teacher, right? Not The sitter, not the Shaman, that's the psychotherapist. If they're doing the right their job correctly, in my opinion, their job is to let you have your encounter with the medicine and the medicine is what you learned from. They're there to facilitate that. They can intervene if you get anxious or have things go on, make sure you know, nobody comes to the door, that kind of thing. But basically it's to facilitate a learning opportunity where you and your teacher, which is the medicine, be at Iowasca or mushrooms or whatever. Can have this intense one on one interaction, you know, I feel like with psychedelics as well as with all these other

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       things that we're talking about, any kind of drug, I mean even coffee, alcohol, whatever, and behavior patterns, all these different things. I think one of the things that happens with human beings is you get so far along in your life in these behavior patterns become so tight grooves that are carved into your psyche and then as you become an adult, then you start to learn like, oh, there's got to be a better way to handle this. Let me figure out how to do this. And it's almost like getting a car when you're really young and not learning how to drive until you're like in your twenties and so you're just driving this thing. It's smashing into trees and grinding the gears and then somewhere along the line you're like, oh my God, I'm fucking myself up. I have to figure out a way to do this correctly.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       And there's two different approaches. One, the abstinence approach, which is very popular. People say, well, I'm, I'm straight edge now. I don't do anything and that's it and I just, you know, just do wheat grass and I run hills and stuff and like, okay, you could do that too. I mean, you can do it. You definitely can do that too, but it's. I just don't think that there's anything wrong with any of these things. I think there's something wrong with the way we use them and I think it's one of the inherent problems with things being illegal is that we can't discuss this. We don't have people like you or centers where people can go where people can become educated on the proper way to use these drugs or medicines, whatever you want to call them, these compounds and get something out of them that can really be beneficial.

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       Right. That's exactly right. I mean, I've said this many, many times that, you know, drug education, what they call drug education in this country is a joke because the whole emphasis is on don't use them. That's absurd. That's like telling, you know, an 18 year old guy full of testosterone don't have sex. Come on, it's built into the genetics. They're going to go for that. What you have to do, what they can bring themselves to acknowledge in the drug education field is it's not about telling people not to use drugs. It's about teaching people how to use drugs if they choose to. Right. I mean like any other skill, people have to learn to drive. They have to learn to do yoga. They have to learn to do whatever they do. There's an educational process. I tell people many times, you know, my shtick is there is no such thing as a bad drug and that's another problem with the dialogue.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       The badness is projected onto the drugs. The drugs are simply compounds with a certain form. Ecology. There's no moral aspect to them. The moral dimension comes in. How do people use them? That's where you know it's human behavior that's moral or immoral life. I say, you know, there's no such thing as a bad drug. Plenty of bad ways to use drugs, but that comes from the not the calm town. I've been really disturbed lately by these new super potent painkillers. Oh, it's fentanyl. All the stuff that killed prince and carfentanil now, as the big men say fentanyl is bad enough, carfentanil is something like 100 to a thousand times more potent than fentanyl. What? Yeah. So as Spec, literally a pinhead or less of the Carfentanil is a lethal dose. Oh my God. Yeah. So this is really not good, you know, because I am certainly not an expert on, you know, the sources and all this, but apparently this stuff is being made in China imported here and they use it to cut heroin because it's so strong that people are dying left and right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       You know, because of Carfentanil is far more, uh, far more toxic than heroin or even fentanyl. So, you know, we're so, you know, there is so much, I don't know, so much confusing and, and fuzzy thinking about the whole drug issue, you know, for example, as long as we're talking about opiates for the moment, which is not really what I came in, talked about. But um, you know, you've heard of Kratom yeah. Right now the DEA and the FDA. It's a plant. It's used in Thailand. It is an OPA. There's no doubt about it hits the opiate receptors and they want to schedule it, but the problem is that in Thailand traditional areas, it's often used to get off of heroin, so it's potentially part of the solution, not part of the problem. It's a, you know, it's relatively easy to quit and the big thing about Kratom it doesn't cause respiratory depression and respiratory depression is what kills people from narco, from heroin overdoses.

Speaker 2:          00:10:59       It's the alkaloids and Metro Jina and do not do that and Kratom is currently in those weird semi illegal states and this semi legal state, but the DEA would love to schedule it, but again they had plans to and there was some pushback about this. Some people were saying things like, I'm saying, wait a minute, let's take a second look at this. This may be part of the solution because it could be a kind of a in a sense, and the herbal methadone. I mean Methadone's not the best way, but something that people could substitute and then gradually taper off. Kratom has some weird sort of property. We're at low doses is a stimulant. Yes, I've tried it before, but only at low doses I've had, um, there's a company that sells it, that we have it right here. Oh, there are lots of companies that sell it.

Speaker 2:          00:11:48       Yeah. His company, um, urban ice organics, that's the name of the company. Um, but I've, I take two or three of those and it's like a cup of coffee and it's like no weirdness. No, don't feel high that at a low dose. It is that. Why is that a stimulant? Who knows? Just unique pharmacology. How strange though, at higher doses it's a, it's definitely an OPA. And is it something that impairs motor skills? Uh, well, not so much. I mean just in the sense that it's like being high on morphine or heroin does. I mean, you know, so it really can give you that kind of a feeling. Absolute. Wow, that's interesting. You know, it hits the opiate receptors, but then it also hits few other receptors as well, which is part of the stimulating effect. But you know why the pharmaceutical companies are not all over this plan?

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       I don't understand because for a long time the holy grail and drug discovery when it comes to analgesics is fine. The narcotic that is not toxic, you know, the analgesic that is not toxic, hopefully not addicting, but that's not gonna happen. And is there an ld 50 for this stuff? Old Short. I mean there's an ld 50 for most things. For people in a lethal dose at 50 percent it would be hard. Yeah, the full dose for 50 percent of the size of the sample. But in the herbal form it would be hard to get anywhere near a lethal dose. You have to giant brick of it. Probably probably you throw up before he ever got to the league, if you, if you isolated one of the alkaloids, seven hydroxy metro is the strongest one that's about 100 times stronger than morphine. Whoa. You know, so definitely effect.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       So is there any issue with that stuff though, with people who have had problems with pain pills in the past, maybe they start indulging this a little bit too much and. Well it's a better alternative than the pain pills. It's very good for people who want to get off that shit. Sorry, can I say that? This is the Internet want to get off, those kinds of things. They don't, they can't quit cold Turkey, but they could go on Kratom and gradually cut down because the withdrawal symptoms for Kratom or much less apparently than for heroin and the and these things, they just don't grab you. So this is a gateway out of the addiction, you know, or they could even just maintain because it's not particularly dangerous, dangerous or impairs function or so and they could maintain, as you know, lots of people take heroin and managed to maintain.

Speaker 2:          00:14:42       Well I know a lot of people, not everyone can do that. They find some really good anti-inflammation properties and this stuff, like people who exercise a lot, create them. Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't surprise me at all if that's there. Um, you know, most plants have multiple effects. That's one of the differences between plants and pharmaceuticals. Plants have families of molecules and they often have complimentary tie kinds of activities, you know, so Kratom is one of these, we've known about it for awhile. It needs a lot more work, but potentially it's very, very interesting, you know, and of course the other one and in this sort of universe of, uh, of OPA treatment is Ibogaine, which is not a completely different kind of thing I will gain is not itself a, an OPA, but people use it to get off opiates because the experience is profound, but then it does something that a lot of psychedelics don't do, which is it interrupts that craving for opiates depending on how it's structured anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       And the thing I think that determines the effectiveness of, of Ibogaine as a treatment for opiates is if the person has prepared for what happens afterwards, right. You got to prepare for what happens after. If you go back to your old neighborhood, your old buddies, your old habits. It's not gonna work. You know, you're not making a serious commitment to make it work. But if you have a plan going to go to this clinic at this treatment, get cleaned up, then what? You know, and that's true. I mean that's really. I think that's the main factor that determines whether Ibogaine is effective or not, and it is for a lot of people it works. It's a problematic substance. It's not, it's a controlled substance in the states, but only in about six countries. Is that actually prohibited? Most countries it's either in a gray area, I guess it's a gray area.

Speaker 2:          00:16:53       It's unregulated is the term couple of countries, so put it on prescription drugs status, uh, Brazil and New Zealand. But it's the framework is there. That doesn't mean there's a rush of people to go to Ibogaine clinics in those countries. It really hasn't created a rush. But the framework is there of people who want to want to do that. So I began this, another one of these that needs more investigation than is potentially part of the problem to the opiate epidemic. There is a rumor, I will. They're more than rumors, but uh, some, uh, Ibogaine activists are trying to get certain states to provisionally approved the use of Ibogaine, you know, special lever from the federal government, Fremont. And I think New York has now applied for this because their problem is so bad. It's like basically they're saying to the government, here's something that may work, just grant permission on the state side statewide basis to have this medicine.

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       We'll see where that goes. You know, as you, I'm sure you, I think we're all in this community acutely aware of now. The government is again rumbling about how they're going to revive the war on drugs. I mean, it was a stupid idea. The end of. It's even more stupid now, but hey, that's government did stupidity are us kind of their, their angle on things. So this jeff sessions characters real see how it goes. I'm not too worried because I think there's going to be so much pushback on this. Yeah. And that's the other thing about trump. He seems to be a populist and if there is too much pushback from that direction, I think he's going to try to avoid that as much as possible when they did a recent survey of the United States. And how many people, uh, think that marijuana should be legal like recreationally legal.

Speaker 2:          00:18:56       It's 60 percent now, which is for the first time ever. Yeah. And states have done it and I just don't think you can, you know, you can't go back to the war on drugs. I mean, it was a miserable failure when it happened. There's no over 40 years. They pounded over a trillion dollars down this rat hole. There are more drugs, more kinds of drugs, easier to get cheaper than ever. So where's the success and more people in prison as a result of this. So where's the success drug? There's nothing, there's nothing they can point to. It's not like anyone was saved. It's not like, right. The problem is that these people, you know, facts don't carry much weight with them. I mean, they're kind of off in their own private ideological fantasy and uh, the fact that the war on drugs doesn't work, doesn't matter to them.

Speaker 2:          00:19:49       It's like these are bad people who need to be punished. That's their, their stance on it. It's not about anything other than that. Yeah. I think that's really important. What you just said. These are bad people. They're really talking in these simplistic terms. That's one of the thing that session said that marijuana is not something that good people use. Preposterous grandmas are out there that are listening to this going, what the fuck is this guy talking about this? This is crazy. Well, it is, and it's clear that, you know, not a jot of reflection or, or, you know, careful thought goes into these kinds of statements. This is what bothers me. I mean many, many things bothered me about trump, but one of the chief things, one of the major, I guess you could say flaws in his character among many, but you listen to him talk, he listened to his general thing and you realize this is not a man who's ever had a reflective thoughts in this life.

Speaker 2:          00:20:50       You know, there is no there, there, there is no inner self, uh, you know, people say, oh, just give that man some Iowasca and that will straighten them out. I don't think so. I think there's, you know, there has to be something inside to straighten out. I mean, he's, I think that maybe I would like to speak to him alone and find out who he really is. I mean, you think when someone's speaking in front of, you know, a big group of press or you know, any, anytime there's a camera on them, it's really hard to figure out who that person is. Being alone with someone would be very illuminating. I would. I agree. Maybe alone he's different, but he is such a creature of media and television. It's inexorable, right? Yeah. So maybe there is a thoughtful person there, but I sure don't see any evidence of that, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       And that's unfortunate. I mean because that's whatever you could say about Obama and there's many bad things that, you know, he was not a perfect president. He was very thoughtful and smart. You know, I'm not so sure trump is smart. I mean he's smart in a certain way, but not the way that we need our leaders to be smart, you know, in this age we need to, you know, anyway, we could go on all day about this and that's really what we wanted to. We could go on about this all day and let's definitely not. Let's instead, let's shift gears and talk about this celebration of 50 years of psychedelic research and what you're doing now, and it's in Birmingham. Hazara is. It's in. It's in Buckinghamshire, England. I knew it was a B. Yeah. One of those places. It's not. This is something that I've wanted to do for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:22:40       And what the backstory is that in 1967 there was a conference that was sponsored, believe it or not, by the health education and Welfare Department of Health, education and Welfare, National Institute of Mental Health, US government paid for this symposium held in San Francisco in 1967 called the ethno pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs. And all the biggies were there. You know, Shogun was there. Andrew Weil was there, um, shelties, of course he was probably the one that, you know, more or less around whom it coalesce. But this was a chance for interdisciplinary people to come together in a private conference and share knowledge. And that was done. And they published this symposium volume called Ethno pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs, which was us public health service publication. You could get it from the US government printing office for a long time. And uh, but the originally, the idea was that about every 10 years or so late, how followup conferences, right?

Speaker 2:          00:23:52       Well, 67, the war on drugs came along. The government became embarrassed that they had anything to do with this and there was never any followup conference. Right? So I though that book that came out was very influential to me. It was one of the big influences in my life as a 16 year old when I was just getting interested in psychedelics. So for many years I've wanted to do a followup conference. I wanted to do it on the 30th anniversary back in [inaudible] 97, but it never came together to do that. So this is the 50th anniversary. It's now or never.

Speaker 2:          00:24:35       And so it's now apparently we are gonna do this thing and uh, it's gonna be kind of much in the spirit of the original conference. Um, we're not going to keep it completely closed, you know, because we're not that kind of people. There's not much, not a lot of room for people to actually come to the place that's going to be, which is this place called tearing ham hall. It's like, it looks exactly like Downton Abbey. I mean it's a English country house, beautiful place, but not a place set up for a huge conference. They'll be maybe 10 guests stayed there and a bunch of people staying close by, but the point is not so much the people attending. It's going to be live streamed on facebook, which anyone can tune into that. And uh, then we're going to publish the symposium volume for 2017 that everyone who presents is going to submit a full paper.

Speaker 2:          00:25:36       We're gonna publish that as volume two will bring them out together as a deluxe edition. The first one which is available for free, it's in the public domain and then the one from this conference and we'll, we'll package them together as a collector's edition and we're preselling that now as part of the strategy for I'm getting the money to pay for this thing and we're doing okay, you know, so I give you the website, it's Esp d, fifty.com. What is done for ethno pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs, Fifty 50th anniversary.com. And then there's also a facebook page which were the live streaming is going to be. So if you go there, you can order the book, you can get the whole backstory, you can sign up for the facebook live stream and so on. And uh, that's what we're gonna do. And we've, I've been very lucky.

Speaker 2:          00:26:38       Have, you know, some people, you know how these conferences are, you don't do it on your own. When I sort of floated this idea, a lot of people stepped up and said, yeah, I want to be involved. All be involved, not only people that are helping organizing it, but also people that are providing some funding. So now we have the money to pay people, bringing them from all over the world. There'll be about 18 presenters, um, uh, and some really good people, some very high profile people. David Nichols will be there, Mark Plotkin, who runs the Amazon conservation team, um, a number of, you know, those are maybe the two highest profile, but people that are known in the field and there's, you know, you can look at the website [inaudible] dot com. You can look at the program and if it appeals to you, get on the uh, you know, get on the live stream so that, you know, those technologies did not exist in 1967.

Speaker 2:          00:27:45       Right? So they do now. So why not let the world in, you know, we can't have everybody come to Buckingham Shyer, but we can have them all over the world. So that's the idea. Well, I'm sure the response to this is going to be tremendous. If you can live stream it and live streaming on facebook, it's going to be huge. I mean, that's a great idea. Well, I hope so. It is for sure. It's an awesome use of the technology because there really isn't something like that that people can tune into and watch 18 different people speak and of course it'll all be documented so it will be archived, will generate a dvt out of it, but mainly it's the ball, it's the books. I mean the idea of actually collecting real physical books might seem like a quite 20th century idea to people and it is, we have to do it while you still can.

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       I like the idea of having a nice box set. Yeah. But uh, people don't have to get that. They can get the single one. They don't have to do anything. If they're interested they could do it. And so, you know, thanks for letting me come out and let people know about this and tweeting it and so on. This is all. This is all very helpful and it looks like there's going to be a lot of response. And then of course the psychedelic science conferences coming up and we have, you know, the symposium symposium guys there. They're running the stage at the maps conference, the, a stage in the marketplace. So I'm going to be on there and they're collaborating with us to on this project. So I'm pretty excited about it. Now. How do you organize the 18 different people that are talking and the subjects so there's no overlap and so that, you know, the, the message becomes, stays vibrant, will it?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       It hasn't really been a problem. I mean, for one thing, you know, I pretty much knew who I wanted to come and I know what their specialty is. So I invited these people and they cover a variety of specialties. So not really too much duplication. Everyone brings something unique, their own perspective. Um, you know, so it's, it's pretty easy really. I mean, the idea of the ethno pharmacologic search for psychoactive drugs is the apt, you know, we want it to focus on the frontier of this. This is still a very active area and we, we don't want, you know, not another conference about Iowasca not on the, you know, and that's all wonderful and I'm totally behind it. And in fact, truth in advertising, we got four talks on Iowasca, but different aspects of Iowasca that haven't really been discussed so much at conferences. And then we have, we do have one gentleman talking about Kratom, uh, and uh, you know, a specialist of ethno pharmacologist talking about that we have, can alper who is maybe the REC worlds recognized authority on Iboga or Ibogaine and from the pharmacology chemical, clinical side, we've got him, we've got to Dave Nichols, uh, we have, uh, another, uh, person, uh, another, uh, phytochemistry talking about Salvia divinorum.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Um, so these are things that we're not even on the radar, you know, in 1967. And that's kind of the idea that there's been 50 years more work at a lot of work and never any followup conferences. So that's the excuse for doing this. This will be the followup conference and if it gets momentum then maybe we'll be able to do number three and number four. Well, probably by the time number four comes around, I'll be drooling in my oatmeal, so I may not have much to do with that. There's going to be some new science. It's going to kick you right back into gear. Let's hope so. There's a lot going on right now. Hold it on for. I think you're catching the wave at the right time, Dennis. Sometimes I wonder, but you know, I'm super positive for you. Um, what is the status of Salvia Salvia divinorum?

Speaker 2:          00:32:11       What is the legal status? Salvia divinorum is more or less legal on the federal level. It's still sold. I think a few states have banned it. Uh, I'm not sure which states how funny that it's the opposite way, you know, most things are federally illegal and then the states legalize them like marijuana at least, but salvias for people to know. Super Potent Psychedelic, super potent. And I'm super bizarre, very weird. And I think maybe that's kind of the built in a built in protection against abuse because a lot of people don't care for it, you know, it's like once isn't enough. Never again many pI. mean, this is not something that you're likely to get addicted to, you know, unless you're just a very peculiar, because it's dysphoric, you know, it's not pleasant. Most people find it quite, quite unpleasant, even terrifying. Um, well, years back.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       But I think one, one of the, one of the things that protects against, if people smoke it, which is not the traditional way at all, but again, it's like it minutes. The traditional way is you choose a fresh leaves and it's the sage. It's some variation of the sage plant, correct. It's, um, it is a sage or a mint. It's in the mint family and yeah, it's called the sage, but it's really a mint. I always wondered if there was some sort of correlation between the name's sage, meaning wisdom, you know, and then this stuff. No, just total bum luck. Some would like you to think. So I think. I think Daniel Siebert, who's one of the specialists, he has a website called sage wisdom.org or.com and good stuff. He's, he's into Kratom. He provides, I mean, Salvia. He provides good information on it there. Most people, at least my own experience in many people, it's like, well, it's interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       It's profoundly strange. And what do you bring back from it? You know, that's the question. What do you bring back from it? I think that's partly why, you know, most people are, they don't, they don't seek it out. Particularly my friends are people that do like it. I know a lot of people that do. Yeah, I don't. I only did it once and I had this very bizarre out of body experience. But, uh, I don't think I took enough. I had a friend, Ari, who took a lot who over the course of 10 minutes lived, maybe he, he believes in the neighborhood of five to six months and in this dimension where you had a life and he had friends and he had a job and relationships and he went through this and came back and you know, 10 minutes later he's like, this is going to be impossible to describe, but I, I, I lived a life I had like this alternative reality that I went through for multiple months.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       Those, those kinds of experiences, believe it or not, are not that uncommon mountain Salvia, somebody told me once they had the experience where you know they were in a place, they were like seven or eight years old. It was Christmas morning. They were at the Christmas trees celebrating Christmas, opening the presents with a family that this guy had no connection to the team and like, what do you make of that? I mean, I think Salvia is interesting in that, in that regard, in that, you know, some of these ones that don't, they're worth exploring. Right? I mean if you can distort time or actually go into, you know, parallel dimensions or whatever that's looking into. I think it takes more intrepid psychonauts than I am to look into that. But I would encourage people to carefully explore this. You know, years ago when I first explored DMT, you could get five Meo dmt online.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       There was a chemical company you could buy it and I bought like a, like a jug of it, like a container of it, like the size of this Stevia container, which is for people don't know enough to get high for the rest of your life. DMT once a month for the rest of you and that's all you want to do. By the way, especially five meo five meo brings you to someplace that feels like the ultimate center of the universe and there's nothing and it's you. You're a part of the whole. It's, it's also no visuals which is really weird. Or if it is a visual, it's like these opaque geometric patterns that exist in this bizarre white and you just cease to exist and it feels terrifying and strange and you know, again, there's no accounting for taste. I, I agree. It is like that. There are no visuals so that's something strange about it, but many people feel like if it puts you in this void place or the zero energy point.

Speaker 2:          00:37:25       I don't know if you've had James Orac on here. No. He wrote the book tryptamine palace. No, which is all about five methoxy dmt with how do you spell his last name? Uh, Orac, O r o c k, I think the name of his book is tryptamine palace. And they, you know, his thing is five methoxy and has thing, Huh? Now, uh, and, and it's an interesting book. And now you know, the Sonoran towed, right? You've heard that. That's five methoxy toad. You excrete something on like glass, you excrete the venom, you actually have to torture the toad a little bit, uh, or squeeze the venom which is in the parotid glands. You squeeze it out on a slide, dry it out, and then you can smoke it. That's about 11 to 15 percent, five mil. But it's, it's a heavy hit. Do they know why this toad produces this in venom?

Speaker 2:          00:38:31       I mean, is it psychoactive when you eat it low? Who knows? Who knows? Most tolds produced [inaudible], right? This is very close to five methoxy it. And in fact it's named after the toads. That genus of toads is Bufo, right? [inaudible] is found in most of these toads, but bufo our various is the only species known that contains five methoxy DMT. So it's got this Molech, you know, there's a probably single gene mutation that lets it produced this methoxy related, a compound which is much stronger than [inaudible] name. Um, and by the way, just to caution people sometimes in the media you hear about people are licking toads. That's not going to do it. No, they're not liquid and toads, they're smoking isn't aware that it just gets, tend to lick him because they, they're nasty things that will be, that will kill you if you look at the pie, realized, yeah, these cardiac glycosides Oh God.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       But pirate realizing it, burning it destroys all those things so that, that, that it's okay to smoke it, but it's definitely a dangerous tool. Lick it. Most people don't like licking toads anyway. That's probably. Yeah. That various fairy tales is that the human body produced five Meo DMT as well. Oh yes. Yeah. And is it produced in the same area? Like the liver and the lungs and presumably the, the pineal gland, all of these things, you know. Uh, yes it does. There's a lot of controversy about whether, you know, these endogenous tryptamines dmt primarily, but five vimeo is definitely there as well until they have a function. You know, there is a lot of speculation and not a lot of facts about whether they actually have a function. A, I mean, they're, they're made. And uh, you know, there's, there's one school of thought that says, yeah, they're, they're sorta like physiological noise, you know, they'll never reach a point where you could actually perceive any effect because the enzymes, you know, think kind of secular insight. We'll just chop up dmt very readily. It's so close to human metabolism. It's not gonna, it's gonna be very ephemeral in the system, even if it is released, but other people maintain that under some circumstances the DMT can be stored in vesicles and neuro vesicles and released on demand or when some stimulus leads to its release like stress, some stress of some sort will go out and grab that painting that that young guy sent the guy who has a pineal gland tumor who makes this really crazy trip to mean art. This guy, I've

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       this guy, this guy sent me one of his pieces and he, uh, he has a tumor. Do you know his name? Jamie will, we'll find his name. I'll give this guy some some love, but he, he look at his artwork and you go, oh yeah, that's what that is. You know, almost like Alex grey stuff. But Alex Gray stuff is a, it's art. I mean, it's definitely representative of the tryptamine world. It's beautiful and fantastic and amazing. Right? But it's art. This guy's stuff seems like a trip, but it gets the chaos of the tryptamine experience is sort of replicated in his artwork. Yeah, that's it. And so this young guy, what we'll find out his name, um, he, uh, he sent this. I first heard of have this gentleman from the. Holy Moly, take a look at this. Yeah. I first heard of this guy from John.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       Oh, Hiya. Who organized this? Alex? A up. I don't think there is enough. So I think this is a, this is a zero gravity environment. Any way that you want it to be. This is pretty amazing. That's amazing. Wow. Yeah. Well, I'm waiting for the. We're building a new studio and when that's done, we'll have this up prominently featured, but this kid's work is just incredible. Jamie, see if you could find it. Who He is, but he should be. Is He? I hope he's healthy letting himself be looked at by medical people. I think he's just happy to be tripping all the time. This is going to leave about science. Sean Thornton. Shout out. Shout out to Sean Thornton. Yeah, there's this work there. It is. Artists got cancer. The pineal gland is paintings will leave you speechless. Yes. They will say, well, Sean, third storton. Sean Thornton.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       Amazing. Yeah. His stuff is incredible and apparently, well, he's in, at least in some sort of way, anecdotal evidence that it's produced in the pineal gland. Of course, the Cottonwood Research Foundation that Dr Rick Strassman is a part of in his amazing work from DMT, the spirit molecule, of course, the documentary that you and I were in, his, uh, his work has shown that it's a, it is produced by the pineal gland in live rats. So we know now for a fact that at least in that mammal, it's a, it's produced in the pineal gland, but that's always been for people that, uh, you know, I went to the Vatican last summer and I'm, one of the really cool things was the giant pine cone that they have in the center of one of the outer areas. And I was really lucky to have a very good guide who is a professor.

Speaker 1:          00:44:15       And he was explaining to me that that was representative of the pineal gland. And uh, yeah, it was really fascinating because there's this enormous pine cone and it's surrounded by these two peacocks are two peacocks on the side there where they're supposed to represent a mortality, some sort of a strange way. So I don't know what that whole vision was supposed to mean, but he was very adamant that that pine cone there, you see it up there on the screen that, that is representative of the pineal gland and also in ancient Egypt and a lot of the hieroglyphs you see that as well, right? Well, yeah, pineal itself means because it is shaped like a pine cone. That's why, that's why it's named that. But I have no idea. That is very interesting. Yeah. Was pretty fascinating. What was also fascinating was this guy, although he knew that that was representative of the pineal gland, he did not know that the pineal pineal gland produce dmt. He wasn't even aware of what the EMT was. Right. So he and I had this really cool conversation about it where it was like, what know this crazy Italian accent, this is amazing. And he's writing things down and I'm writing to telling him about strassman's work and you and your brother and all these different things to look into and you know, there is a. my wife was rolling her eyes like, oh Jesus, not this shit again.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       You just have happy taken out in public joe. You always embarrassed when she just. She knew as soon as the guy said, pineal gland in my eyes lit up and I'm like, here we go. Let's talk about drugs. Well, there is a guy, a couple of interesting people have to mention in this context. One of them is a researcher

Speaker 2:          00:45:57       guy named Ed Frick. Ska Ska. How do you spell that? Good question. Ed. F R e e C K S K, I think I may have to correct myself on that. He's a pharmacologist and a neurochemical, neuro chemist and psychiatrist. But he is the one that's really kind of leading the charge for endogenous functions of DMT and has good evidence which has been, you know, disputed by some. I mean Dave Nichols is kind of on the other side. He's like, ah, dmt. It doesn't have any internal function. All these people are diluted, you know, that seems to me to be really cocky too. Well, I think that it's surprising that Dave who's a very careful scientist would have such, you know, such pre formed ideas, very rigid idea. Right. There's a conference in the UK at the end of June called breaking convention, which you may have heard of. It's a big. It's like a psychedelic conference. Dave and the Ed are going to be there. I'm going to be there. Hopefully keeping them up. I don't want any.

Speaker 1:          00:47:13       They're going to be talking about this and doing into Beta on it. Breaking Convention. You might tell people to Google that. That's very interesting conference for sure. What makes Dave so confident? I mean when you consider the potency of it and the knowledge that that's produced in the body and then also the knowledge of the effects of it, which are just astounding. Right? How could anyone say that you know for sure. Does he done it as David? Of course he's it. Could he do it and not go? Okay. What is this? Well, I think he does, but then there's also this very reductionist side to him. Then basically just as a pharmacologist, he says it's never going to reach, you know, sufficient concentration in the plasma to have an effect. However, I think he's wrong. And I told him, I mean, I was teasing him, I was saying, you know, I, I wrote back, you know, that famous phrase, the Arthur c dot Clark once said, you know, when, when a distinguished but elderly scientists says that something is possible, he's very likely correct when he says it's impossible. He's almost certainly wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       Well, when you're talking about that, just general bio diversity of human beings and how some people. Let's talk about other human neurochemistry, like, like depression, like some people are super happy and have no problem with their dope, meaner, serotonin levels and there's other people that have real issues. Yeah. Well there is that, right? So just look at that, the variability of that, and then also how that can be manipulated with exercise and all these other different things that can raise those levels up. What about the other thing, like in terms of like holotropic breathing or all these different shamonic breathing and yoga exercises? Um, Kundalini Yoga, which I haven't experienced it and couldn't let Jonah, but I did have a very bizarre experience fairly recently on yoga where I went into class on a pretty pretty high dose of cannabis and I started tripping in the middle of one of the more intense poses.

Speaker 1:          00:49:19       It was just something akin to the very beginnings of a dmt trip where I started seeing patterns and seeing things moving and some sort of a. It didn't go anywhere, but I don't pursue it in terms of attempting to make that happen. But I would imagine that if it's made in the body and then the, the, the effects of it are reproducible when you take it. I mean taking dmt is a very few people was a very small percentage that don't have an experience when they take it. Right? Very small percentage. Do we know what that number is? Probably something like. I mean I would say a wild guess, but a two percent or something anomalous. Why should there be people who don't have any effect? I mean, that's a whole other question about what's strange about their metabolism, but it's interesting that you raise this because a lot of these yoga techniques, especially Kundalini, is probably about inducing dmt synthesis in the pineal or wherever it occurs. There's also a very

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       interesting technology that has come to light. I just found out about it last summer called the adage know light. Have you heard of this age? A J. A N a. So write down on the light.com. The Sky who's developed this very interesting fellow. He's named a guy heroin and uh, he used to work for apple. He actually worked very closely with Steve Jobs when Steve Jobs had next computing. So he's basically a computer programmer and the engineer worked with Steve Jobs, but then he, for some reason he decided he had to move to Thailand and become a zen monk, which he did, but he continued to work with technology and he developed this thing called the original light, which he claims induces dmt synthesis in the pineal. And uh, I was at a conference last summer actually tearing him at this place where this one is going to be and he was there.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       I tried it a couple of times. And by Golly, it's a lot like dmt dealing. Yeah. What is it? It's, it's just, uh, it looks like a floor lamp. It's, you know, nothing. It's got a, it's got this array of ld leds on a, on a holder. You lie under it. And if they're just white leds and they programs that from his ipad, I guess in different sequences, but you lie under this thing for a few minutes and pretty soon you get into the zone, you know, these visuals begin to manifest and it looks a great deal like dmt. So them and he claims, you know, it's synthesizing dmt and the pineal and it is very much like dmt would be if it's released at the site of action, because you know, dmt is when you smoke it, it brings some big body load, which you have to wear that goofy outfit.

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       What's with the orange outfit? Seriously, I can tell that they're in Thailand. I understand that. The expression of muchness the pious outfit, let it go folks just where wear a tee shirt or whatever. I would just have to get into a, you know, into an econ student to do it. But I wouldn't do it a couple times. How many times did you do it? Well, I was not there long enough to do. I did it a couple times and this woman's setting is, is just effective sitting as it as lying down. Uh, I couldn't tell you, but I expect so you lie, you lie down. I laid down and close your eyes and know it well. Yeah, you close your eyes. Doesn't matter because it's coming through. You don't have eyeshades on and usually he's playing some music, but then you know in me like the reductionist kicks in and says, well guy, this is interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       How do you know it's really dmt that you're, that you're stimulating. And we've been going back and forth on that and how can you test that? And there, there are ways to do it, but most of them involve some fairly drastic procedures like you can do that you wouldn't want to do on people because they wouldn't give you permission if they had any sense. But you could do two rats, you could do something called micro dialysis, you can put a centrally, a microscopic, a tube that's absorbed the next to the pineal and you can collect samples that you detect. This is not something that people would volunteer for. How about just take, take your word for it? Well I just want to know does it really reduce it or not? I am not saying it does, but it's a lot like dmt. What about hovering something like that over a sensory deprivation tank, like being inside of it and having it hover over your head so you have the added experience of out of body with that.

Speaker 2:          00:54:29       I mean I would think that'd be pretty intense and not hard to recreate. Probably not you. Probably what you'd probably want to do with that, this to have some kind of goggles essentially that could be connected to his, to his program by Bluetooth or something, so then you're wearing the goggles, you're in the isolation tank, but if you just hover it over your head, if you just have an arm like a computer monitor arm and just swing it over the head and so you turned it on, close the door, the 10, close your eyes, lay back and maybe it has like a 32nd window or lets you settle in. You then begins the program. Lots of ways you could approach it. That just seems to me doing really ramp it up. Now here's the question. Interesting though. This is just one of an array of, you know what you might call neurotechnology is you know, or even spiritual technologies.

Speaker 2:          00:55:24       Maybe this'll make psychedelics obsolete. Well, this is a great way that you could do it without actually having to hold onto an illegal drug. Exactly. Does. You're carrying your illegal drug with you so far, they can arrest you for that. Although I'm sure they're trying to figure out a way that was your brother's classic line. Everyone's holding everyone's holding now with this stuff. Um, did you experience the communication that you get with DMT? Because that to me has always been the most profound aspect of it. Is this feeling that I'm in the presence of something and then they sort of telekinetic understanding the words but not hearing the words. Honestly, I didn't get that because I think I was not under long enough. I didn't have much time. So I was only under each time it was under maybe 20 minutes, which isn't. I think if I'd stayed in that place, if I could settle into it for an hour, I think that probably would manifest, you know, and uh, Diana is what, why do you think this, why do you think would change?

Speaker 2:          00:56:30       Takes Awhile for the, for the thing to fully, you know, uh, whatever the term is for, if it is dmt for the DM t to reach a critical level where you're seeing that kind of stuff, you feel this because it was ramping up during your experience. I felt like it was that if I had stuck around, I thought it would, uh, you know, I thought it would develop and we've talked about too, we've talked about, you know, thinking about how to establish that this really is dmt and other approach that we've tried is to take a or the guys tried. I don't have access to the light, I can't afford it, but guys, it costs about 3,300 bucks, you know, which is not bad, but beyond my pay grade, I'm going to buy for you for a present, buy it and keep it. You're going to buy two of them.

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       I'll buy one for you and me will correspond. All right. All right, well now we're going to do that. I might mention that the guy is offering a conference special here. If you don't have to wear the outfit. Yeah. No you don't. You don't. You'll get a discount on it. If you go through the facebook site, which I'm about to put this beautiful, we can talk about this offline, but through facebook some portion of it will go toward supporting this conference. So I would love that. I'm very curious about this because I'm, I know that I have a good buddy of mine, my friend Danny, who's done a Kundalini for quite a long time and he can reproduce dmt states. He's actually had dmt experiences independently of the Kundalini and he says it's the same thing. He says he can get there and I believe him.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       I just too lazy or something. I don't know what it is. I just, I'm not inclined. Well, I think there's a genetic component, you know, I mean like this gentleman, although he has a tumor [inaudible], I'm not sure why. Maybe he doesn't want medical people poking and prodding him, but he would be a perfect subject to settle a lot of issues. She was willing to, you know, cooperate. I mean just having a look at his cerebral spinal fluid, which would be the obvious, you know, fluid to sample for this would be very interesting. Yeah. But I could understand his reluctance. If he has reluctance. People are drilling into your dome, Kinda suck out brain juice. Does it sound fun? But it is interesting though, that these compounds are in, in some way a part of normal human neurochemistry and why? Right. And Dave Nichols, what does he believe?

Speaker 2:          00:59:13       Well, I don't know if he believes anything. He just, you know, he just, you know, he just, just skeptical that, that in normal physiological processes, dmt has much of a function. What about dreams? Dreams are a possibility and that's always been the big one. Right. That's always been the big one. And it's totally plausible. You'll have to get him on here. Tim, explain it. I would love to. I mean, uh, you know, I'm not sure. He just has this idea that I think for one thing, I think, you know, he's kind of a reductionist guy. I think the, all the new age stuff, the new excitement about the empty them, hi Neil and all that. It kind of puts them off. But on the other hand, don't assume that we know everything. In fact, we know nothing, you know. And if it's there, I think it probably does have a function, you know, it's not surprising that it's there, it's everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       I mean it's, it's DMT is interesting molecule because it's two steps from Tryptofan, right? Tryptophan is an amino acid and the essential amino acid, one of the 20 that goes into proteins. So tryptophan is an every living thing on this planet and there are two enzymes that are also pretty much universal in cells that can convert dmt or Tryptofan to dmt in two simple steps. You know, I don't want to get too into the chemistry, but basically you remove the amino acid portion of the amino acid, you get tryptamine and from there you add the methyl groups and there you are. You know, which is why DMT is a very, very common in plants for example. And Anna Animals. I mean I, I tell people nature is drenched in dmt. Drenched is a great transcribe DMT. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of species of plants that contain DMT for sure.

Speaker 2:          01:01:17       You know, I mean they haven't, there hasn't been any survey or anything like that. But if you look at the gender that have a lot of DMT, like Acacia is a good example. The Australian acacias are some of the strongest sources of DMT. There's 1700 species of vacation, probably 75 percent of them contain DMT and I'm sure you're aware of the Israeli scientists that believe that the story of Noah, it's not Moses rather, and the burning Bush was the Acacia tree and they think that that was the, the confusion of all the translations. And of course the oral history passed down over many, many years. Then finally written down. But this idea of the burning Bush delivering the word of God was most likely in some way a psychedelic trip induced by DMT and most likely because of the acacia tree, most likely the acacia tree, because that was in the area, the, you know, I mean an interesting idea. And the, and it's interesting that the, uh, you know, sort of the way that the burning Bush presented itself was like dmt presents itself. You cannot take your eyes away from it, but at the same time you cannot look at.

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       But Pharma, you don't even know what you're saying. There was this something that he smoked was in incense. I was, he exposed to this and uh, you know, because that will make a difference because you can't eat dmt because it's destroyed by monoamine oxidase. Right. That's the whole basis of Iowasca in terms of these Acacias, you know, the question comes up also. We'll. Okay. Most of them are native to Australia. So did the aborigines know about this and if you look at their art, it's like, looks like dmt. It's very psychedelic art. I haven't really looked at very much point to list kind of designs in aboriginal art. I mean they're extremely psychedelics if you could find some of that. But they, the uh, the aborigines, I think they had to know about it. They're just not talking about it, but one possible way that they could have used it because the dmt and the acacias is so high.

Speaker 2:          01:03:36       The leaves, some of these cases there are two percent dmt. Wow. So if you were to take leaves and throw them on a fire in a enclosed space, like a sweat lodge type space, you could potentially get quite loaded on dmt. There's no indication that they smoked stuff, but they may have fumigated themselves with tmt. Oh, that completely makes sense. If you're talking about a burning Bush. Yeah. Well, exactly. And that's. How does that make its way to Israel though? Well, maybe this, who knows, who knows where anything makes its way. Anyway, these folks technologies, it's interesting. If you look at the, uh, if you look at the new world, you know, in, in the, in the historical sense, people have remarked, why are there so more so many more psychedelic plants in the new world and old world, right? It's something about people people's relationship to plants in this very high biodiversity environment.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       People are mucking around with plants, right? Like a perpetual question that comes up is how did they figure out how to combine banisteriopsis and CITCO trick to get the activity of Iowasca? How out of 80,000 species and the Amazon did they figure out. Can you guys please, to the uninitiated, why, why that's important with the model you not? Well, it's important because banisteriopsis contains these alkaloids called Beta lanes that are monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase is the enzyme in the gut that breaks down Dmt, so you can drink tea with dmt in it, you can eat it all day. Nothing's going to happen because this enzyme will inactivate it. And that's probably a reflection of an evolutionary process, you know, we've adapted to toxins in our environment basically. But, uh, if you inhibit that with the alkaloids from the banisteriopsis, they're very potent, very selective Mao inhibitors that protects it from degradation in the gut.

Speaker 2:          01:05:52       It can cross into the blood and into the blood brain barrier. So that's the basis of the oral activity and people make much about how they sort of stumbled on this combination. Right? And in fact, one of our presenters at this conference, Manuel Torres as an archeologist, has been looking at this for, for quite a while. If, and this is a, you know, this is one of the sort of Gee whiz things. How did these primitive people figure out how to combine these plants? Right. I agree with remarkable. If you talk to the Shaman and they'll say, well, the plants told us, but what does that mean? You know, and but what, what is interesting to me in a way or what I've been thinking about lately, if you look at the archeology of these things, the snuffs that there are two or three different kinds of snuffs that are used in South America that contain DMT, the antigen anthracite snuffs and the Varroa snuffs, the antigen anthracnose knifes are ancient.

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       We have archeological evidence that puts that back to 10, 11,000 years. They are by far the most ancient psychedelics used in the new world or these snuffs that contain dmt. Nobody is asking the question, what possessed these people to take the seeds, grind them up and shove them up their nose. I mean, this is not something that intuitively you would do, and yet that seems to me as easily as puzzling is how did they find the combination for Iowa Ska? Nobody's really addressed that. My first impulse when I meet, when I find a new plant is not necessarily to snort it. It isn't that the place of the pharmacological daredevil. I mean there's always this one person who's out there, dude, Jack, what I found, you know, and that, that curiosity that need to explore things. Yeah, that's exactly right. Somebody stumbled on this and I think the same is true of Iowaska.

Speaker 2:          01:08:00       You know, because the fact dmt is not that uncommon truth to tell made a carbon liens are not that uncommon. So sooner or later people are going to stumble on this combination. Once they did, then you know, they share with them knowledge. It just took time. Yeah, it takes time. Well, do you think there's. It is possible, I mean obviously it's possible, but is there any evidence that points to the idea that primitive primates maybe didn't have this monoamine oxidase and their system and that or if they did, they had it in lower amounts and it allowed more dimethyltryptamine to enter into the body from consuming plants. Like is, is there a potential link between consuming various plants? Like we're talking about thousands of different. Like you could eat a salad if you didn't have model amy and oxidase and you've got, you can eat a salad and potentially trip.

Speaker 2:          01:08:53       Yes. If you didn't have it right is right and when, when you see Jaguars that do trip, like there's, there's all this footage of Jaguars in the jungle eating these plants, what are they doing? Well, do we know or we don't know what. I'm not sure how much I, how much credence I put into that footage, but it could be like catnip, like maybe looks like happening, you know, but they're eating Bev stereopsis apparently, which doesn't have dmt. It's got the Beta carbon blades but, but harming alone contained some psychoactive compounds. Yeah, absolutely. And there are three main Beta car bylines in baptistery stereopsis. In fact, this is what I'm talking about, half the conference. My talk is about Beta carbon cleans a lot of activity. The idea that they're not psychoactive, that they're just Mao inhibitors is not really true. It's an incomplete picture. There are a, a lot of other activities with Beta carbon, so a lot of attention recently refocused on harming, which is the main Beta Carmelina and three opsis.

Speaker 2:          01:10:02       Turns out it has all kinds of activities that have been sort of overlooked and now not least of all, it stimulates a neurogenesis. It stimulates a nerve cell growth. This is big news because it's huge. Yeah. And potentially it, it inhibits a, a, a kinase which has to do with the kinases approach, a protein that phosphorolates things, right? Very common. All kinds of kinases around the body, but it inhibits this one particular kinase called our k one, whatever that means, but it is associated with the, uh, with the stimulation of a nerve growth from neural stem cells. This is all petri plate test tube stuff, but it's not unreasonable to think that this is going on in the bud. So if that plays a part in neurogenesis that could potentially have some real benefits to people that have things like Parkinson's or nerve disorders or exactly maybe ptsd or a cte rather it, it could add or you know, especially dementia's like fog and cognitive Alzheimer's or other types of dementia that are not strictly Alzheimer's that are just kind of senile dementia. Dementias. Um, well I hope it's true because this is going to kick you right back.

Speaker 2:          01:11:36       This is my main prophylactic. You get civility. I figured if I take Iowasca regularly, probably going to be okay. Yeah, right back in the game. Imagine if that's the case. What one of the talks that I listened to have your brothers from way back in the day. He was talking about a scientific nomenclature related to harming and that before they, uh, one of the recent or one of the early explorers to South America when they found this stuff, they were calling it telepathy. Yes. They were calling it telepathy because it induced these groups, states of telepathy because rumor, rumor, deuce. Oh, okay. Yeah, I mean if you want to get into the, you know, what you could call the sordid history of the chemistry investigations of Iowaska because harming and harm ilene and Tetra, hydro, heart and Liza were originally found in [inaudible], which is where they got their names, which is Siri unruh.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       Right. And a lot of people use that as an alternative mal when they are making it Iowasca analogues. So that's how those alkaloids got their names and then when chemists came along, kind of all through the 19th century, they started looking at banisteriopsis and they would isolate things and they didn't know what to call them. Sometimes they call them to let the theme because of the rumors. Sometimes they were called a bet, listerine and uh, uh, a hi iin and because they didn't really know what the compound was, right? And then it turned out, well, it's actually harming anyone. Harming was isolated earlier. So then they got their nomenclature right. There was a long period where they'd never collected voucher specimens. So a lot of this work was in some ways useless because they forgot to collect the actual plants that they did to isolation from.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       It got a little more rigorous. There was a group, a couple of investigators that actually thought to collect the plants that they did the isolation with. So then they could document the source. Right. I mean, people think this is not important, but an ethno pharmacology. It's quite important, you know, for example, for a long time, just just a side thing, you know, for a long time there was a plan called dystonia amazonic that was reputed to be one of the sources of these alkaloids and one of the components used to make Iowasca fat got loose in the literature and it took years to straighten this out because it's not true and there was no doubt there is no voucher specimen to show that this was, you know, it was not Prestoni Amazonia got so bad that shelties actually had to publish a paper that said Prestoni Amazonia Amazonian Hallucinogen or not turns out not, you know, so you have to be aware of bad documentation if you're going to collect plants, know what you're collecting.

Speaker 2:          01:14:48       So the chemists that might come along and work with that can refer back to it, you know, otherwise you, it's just good science and chemists don't think in terms of the Botany Bay, they just have something there and trying to isolate something from it. But you've got to be what it helps to know what the identity of it is. You know. So it seems to me that that part of the world, the Amazon jungle and are really a troubling relationship with it currently is so it, it's, it's, it's so analogous to the way human beings are kind of interfacing with the world. Like that's a good way to look at it there because there's so many different powerful things that they're learning about this one area while people are chopping it down left and right and slashing and burning and making room for cattle grazing and all this other crazy shit that's going on down there.

Speaker 2:          01:15:40       While you know there's so much to be learned still. Well yeah. And there is a Mrs. This is a good illustration of, you know, our sort of penny, penny wise and pound foolish. Less about these things. There are literally trillions of dollars if you just want to look at it in terms of dollars and cents, which is not the best way to look at it because after all this ecosystem, as you know, the burning of the rain forest, it's about 30 percent of human global greenhouse gas emissions. If you could just stop burning down the data for us. Thirty percent, 30 percent, they figure. Wow. But then on the other side of economics, and there have been assessments, how, what w, w, what use do you make of the Amazonian biome to maximize its value? Right? If you do cattle, it's worth so much per hectare if you do a woods.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       Well, yeah, it's a big issue. That's the big issue. Um, but the thing is, in terms of undiscovered potentially undiscovered blockbuster drugs, there's probably at least a trillion dollars worth of undiscovered drugs in the Amazon, which will of course never be discovered because we're going to wreck it and they're already busy. Recommend insane amounts of species of plants in the Amazon has 80,000 species. Yeah. I mean there's about 250,000 species of plants overall, always revising this number and they always seem to revise it up. But between 250 to 300,000 species of so called higher plants. And uh, in the Amazon it's one of the most bio diverse region, about 80,000 species. Wow. So, and all of these, less than 10 percent of this, not even close to 10 percent of this, this incredible molecular and bio and biological diversity has been looked at as potential sources of new medicines.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       You know, I mean there's a whole area of folk medicine and folk knowledge, but to systematically look through these species and isolate things of interest hasn't been done. You know, a very. I mean, it's been going on for years. There's been a lot of work, but it's not really touching. A big proportion of pharmaceutical companies are not interested in this. You know, interestingly enough, they want to know their corporations and despite, you know, they tell you they're finding new medicines that will cure people and help people to a certain extent. That's true. But remember, the bottom line is profit. They want to own everything. You know, they don't want to share intellectual property with the savages down there that are the stewards of this knowledge. You know, why should we let these people have any part of it? So they want to make everything synthetically.

Speaker 2:          01:18:52       They want it all to come out of vats their laboratories. But it's totally wrong approach because, uh, the frequency of compounds that make it from discovery to the clinic are very, is very low, and when they abandoned natural products about 25 years ago, the frequency of drug discovery, that pharmaceutical discovery pipeline as they call it, dried up and it took a long time for pharmaceutical industry to realize, you know, essentially we threw the baby out with the bathwater. We need to go back to natural products because that's where you find the molecular diversity, the scaffolds done, which we can build these drugs, right? I mean, you think of the complex molecules that you find in nature, uh, it may, that may not be what makes it to the clinic, right? It may be a derivative of that or an analog of that, but it's still the plants that give you the ideas for the structure.

Speaker 2:          01:19:57       If you can follow me. It's not that you're gonna grow this rain forest tree in plantations, but you can go and isolate a compound, determine the structure, and then you can probably synthesize and the analog. But the idea comes from nature. And this isn't part of the problem in that isolating one individual compound from a plant that might have multiple compounds that work synergistically. Well, that's another difference, right? Right. I guess the, uh, the FDA and just the whole drug discovery process, they like single compounds, magic bullets. They like the synthetic compounds that is completely define molecularly and we don't, they don't like these all these other related compounds like Marinol for instance, right? Synthetic thc, which is not nearly as pleasant for people who have cancer or glaucoma or any host of very good, very good example. Maryknoll, it does what it does, but the multicomponent preparations of cannabis are much more effective.

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       That's true of almost all herbal medicine now when they isolate thc, um, it's one of how many different cannabinoids. There's, I think there's about 400 different kinds of cannabinoids in cannabis. So when you're getting THC, you're getting one for $400. Lot of other things in cannabis as well. But I believe, I remember reading there were about 400 kinds of chemicals and cannabis. So good example. Incredibly complex plant chemically, you know, and as they all are. But that's, that's a good example. I've never taken Marinol, but everyone that I know that has said it's just a pale imitation of what cannabis gives you. Yeah. Well if it's for one particular for one particular use, which is what the. I guess it's pain, right? Is that what it's used for? But even then the people that take it for that, I've said that it's not nearly as effective as just.

Speaker 2:          01:22:08       This is a good example of the sort of cognitive dissonance of, of the FDA and the whole regulatory thing because for years the FDA has been saying, well, cannabis has no medical use. There's no recognize medical use. Oh, but there is this one drug that the FDA has approved Marinol, which has some small amount of the therapeutic use of cannabis does, but it's just so incredible with so much information available today that they're making such poor choices in that regard that someone can't step up and logically address this thing and say, look, we're. You're getting a fraction of the benefits of this just because of this bizarre need that human beings have to patent things, to own things. Right. And it's not, the plants can't be patented and they can be formulations. Cam, uh, I think, uh, uh, gw pharmaceuticals which has brought up sativas sits standardized a cannabis preparation that you take orally as a mouth spray.

Speaker 2:          01:23:12       So it's a natural product. It's patented, it has all the cannabinoids are well characterized. It's essentially a standardized extract. So that sort of represents where this is going. Well that's a positive. That's a positive branch of it. Right? That's a good thing. That more reflects what cannibus should be as a medicine. And so it's essentially all the properties of cannabis and what they've patented is the formulization, is that what it is? They've had that the formulation? Yeah. And probably the use as well. That's another way you can get patents. So how is that formulation? You need to know that. I couldn't tell you. It's just, it's an oral aerosol sprays. So there's issues that come up with. Is that it? That's a company called jumbo. Makes us spray. Okay. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's similar. It's similar to that. It's a, yeah, it's an oral, it's an oral aerosol and insurance. Well, well standardized in terms of what cannabis cannabinoids are in there, I think they brought it out initially for a multiple sclerosis that was the treatment and then for seizures and they're gradually expanding, you know, I mean, it's interesting how marijuana has gone from, you know, this sort of reviled drug of abuse to now it's the medicine of the future.

Speaker 2:          01:24:43       That's a good thing. I mean, I think, I think that, uh, I think it does have a lot of applications and why it should be illegal. There's no reason for this, you know, but obviously there is, it's in someone's interest to keep it illegal, but that would be my only concern with this patented formula formula that they've sort of figured out is that other people can't make a formula as well as like in patenting. Do they own the process? Like what if it's a very obvious process, like, you know, like the IOWASCA process. It's a very obvious process. The monoamine oxidase inhibitor along with the plant that contains dmt boiled down, everybody knows how to do it. If somebody figures out a way how to patent that, does that, does that become a real problem? And that they own the rights to something that's been around forever?

Speaker 2:          01:25:35       It does, it does become a problem. And, uh, I'm with, as you say, with something like that where, you know, it's pretty obvious how you do it. It's not that complicated. There's no innovative technology there. There's no, there's no art. There's no art of innovation, which is what would make it patentable. There were attempts to patent Iowasca a few years ago and it got to, you know, what actually it was patented and a delegation of indigenous healers from Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru came to the US patent office and petitioned against this and said, we've been using this medicine for thousands of years. How is it that, oh, it was a guy named Lauren Miller who really didn't know what he was doing. I forget what his company was. This was when I was still doing my postdoc at Nih. So this was like mid eighties. He tried to patent that. Then what it turned out was it was a completely specious patent.

Speaker 2:          01:26:41       Uh, it was a patent on a particular strain of banisteriopsis that he collected that had an anomalous flower color, I think. And that was the basis of the patent will. That's absurd because flower color is highly variable. It was, it was a useless patent in every respect. So yeah, the Patent Ofa Office overturn the patent as they well should have. And then I believe it was reinstated for some reason. I haven't really followed this up, but I think by that time everyone kind of came to the conclusion that it was, it was absurd. There was no reason to do it and he didn't really have the resources to develop it. So. And he was not a, you know, he lost a lot of respect because it's not so much that you can't, I mean the intellectual property thing is the real issue, you know, if you. And that's why the pharmaceutical companies want to stay away from traditional medicines by and large because it's like, you know, the enthesis people are, that are the stewards of the knowledge.

Speaker 2:          01:27:54       They know how to use the plant. They maintain the plant, their habitat, you know, it's where the plant is found. I'm so they rightly should have a place at the table, you know, if you're going to commercialize this traditional medicine, they should get something back isn't traditionally we've been ripping things off from indigenous people for a long time. It's called bio piracy. Right. And that's how they operate generally. So that's an issue, but there are ways to address that. Just basically, you know, come to terms with it and acknowledge that their knowledge does count for something and they should have, they should have a part of the, of the proceeds. If you build a map, if you make a billion dollar drug out of this, you should be able to give something back to indigenous people. You know. So it's complicated. It does seem complicated. It also seems like when you, when everything becomes commercial, it becomes, is it like when you look at the idea

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       that pharmaceutical drug companies at all, when you look at a corporation and you think of this idea of infinite growth and this is what they're subscribing to and the constant trying to make more and more money and then you, you think about compounds and compounds being legal and them trying to figure out a way to market these things. It seems to become. It seems to be a big issue that we're relying on that at all. It's almost like the tail of the Scorpion and the frog. The Frog says, tells the Scorpion, Hey, I'll give you a ride across the river, but do me a favor and don't sting me because you deal with both drowned and then halfway through the Scorpion stings, the frog goes, what the fuck? And the Scorpion goes, hey man, it's my nature. It seems like the nature of these corporations is just to make money.

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       So relying on them to bring these intense psychedelic compounds to the market or to even saying the market's terrible word, to just bring them to daily use or bring them to the. Making them free to use. I think the corporations, you know, as you say, their main job as they, as they see it though, they don't say so in public is basically they'll make money, you know, to patent these compounds and making money and make more money every year. And the best way to know there's no revenue model, psychedelics, there's no way for them to make money according to that mall is a way to not make money. Don't give that guy who's got a leaf over his dick, a billion dollars, that guy, he's been happy shooting arrows at monkeys for 10,000 years. That's kind of. Yeah, it's just not. So they're not going to do that if they don't have to.

Speaker 1:          01:30:42       Well they won't. And you know, these are, they want these psychedelics if you use them therapeutically, these are things you might take a few times in your life. They want drugs you take four times a day for the rest of your life. That's the revenue model and the revenue model, if there is one with psychedelics is not that because they have to be used in a context, you know, set and setting, right. The revenue model, if there is one, is to have centers to have places you can go and take psychedelics in a controlled setting. They won't look like clinics. They'll look like spa was, you know, I mean, take the family for a weekend and have a nice, you know, silicide when vacation while you're busy getting your massages and doing yoga and whatever. That's how it's gonna work if it, if it's allowed to go forward. That's the model. Uh, yeah. Well, we'll see. I mean, I've often said the very idea that you could patent or prohibit a plant is absurd. It is absurd. Especially one that's nontoxic.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       What is not patented is prohibited. That's, that's, that's the way they approach in most circumstances, which were real weird, is that we give these caveats to religions. Like that's what's going on now with Iowasca is that there are some companies that have had an exemption through the supreme court. Right? I shouldn't say companies, but it basically that's what they are. There are churches, there are churches, which is really just another way of saying a company out there to their institution. So the question is, and now people are beginning to sort of recognize this or, or ask the question, so you've got your, you've got the UDP, which is one of these churches that's. They're the ones that took their case all the way to the Supreme Court and got approved unanimously under actually the first case that John Roberts decided after he became chief justice. So very conservative court that unanimously ruled that yes, the udv is a real religion, which is fascinating.

Speaker 2:          01:33:08       They have the right to use it well. It clearly is a real religion. It is a real religious. Just fascinating that a conservative court would have, would almost be boxed into doing that because of their views on Christianity. Exactly, exactly. They couldn't not do it. And then the central dimey same thing. They didn't have to go all the way, but essentially they have the same approval and they're piggybacking on this and it's their Christian based religions as well. Yeah, well they're Christian race religion. So now the question is when you go to Peru, there's Iowasca. It's used. It's not as institutionalized. It's kind of idiosyncratic. You know, you've got these practitioners that the traditionals called vegetal small. There's no institution, there's no. There's no doctrine. There's no hierarchy. There's no. There's just freelance practitioners. Question is, is that a religious activity and should it be protected and this is what some smart lawyers are now addressing with the use of Iowaska in the more traditional way.

Speaker 2:          01:34:14       I tend to have essentially taken that they've appropriated that tradition and they say, well, we want nothing to do with these digitas people. Sorry. This is our religion. You know, it's our sacrament. They don't even. They get upset if you even call it a drug or a medicine. To them it's a sacrament. That's fine, but elsewhere it isn't medicine, but it is also a, you know, a religious activity of visually smell has a spiritual aspect. It should be regarded as a religion. We'll see where that goes. It's almost like with the UDV and these other churches that what they've done is they've used this scaffolding of Christianity as a Trojan horse

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       that's allowing this Iowasca to get through. Strassman was telling me his experience with it, with them where they were all wearing golf shirts and they have uniforms and they're taking these insane doses of super potent Iowasca and you know, and then they're all singing and singing songs about Jesus and strassman has like a really like very mellow and easygoing guy. Really pleasant guy. He was explaining how he sat down with these people in the morning after all this is over. It's like, what the fuck are you people doing? Browser raised and he's taking about his trip from the night before. He's like, these people are taking like super potent doses of IOWASCA and they're singing about Jesus with golf shirts on. It's like what the F, you know, they have like plastic folding chairs and shit and like on furniture and it's like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       What it is is it's a religion. It's a religion, that's what it is, you know? Um, but I think it's okay. Read it away, spread it and spread it on. I mean, the thing is I, I worked, I haven't had much to do with central Thai May. Not that I just haven't had the opportunity nor am I particularly interested in going to ceremonies where I am told that I have to dance the whole. Not My thing, but I know the UDP well, you know, because we did the biomedical study with them and the nineties. So they're wonderful people. They're very kind, you know, their families are good. They're very nice people. But I would never join. They asked me to join. I said, look, I don't do cults. I'd be happy to come drink with you anytime that religion or the Groucho Marx one said, I think to paraphrase him, I would never be a member of any group that would have me.

Speaker 1:          01:36:51       Yeah, that's pretty much what I told them. You know, you don't want me heritage by nature, but I'm happy to share your brew and they do make fine brood. No. Does your organization tweeted out for you? But I'm not showing up at the stockholders meeting. I'm not good at joy, but it seems to me with my experience with dmt that it's so powerful and so profound that I wonder if that's a way that Christianity works. You know, like this idea of Jesus and the saints in Heaven and God and all these different manifested deities, like people thumb their nose at it and say it's ridiculous and preposterous, but everything on Dmt is ridiculous and preposterous and I wonder if under the guise of the UDV and they're singing, they're dancing, if Jesus is real in a sense that you can actually communicate with a thing that takes the form of Jesus. In that sense, I wonder what they're seeing. I mean, I really wonder if they're going. The whole idea of psychedelics for the non initiated is a big

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       part of it is how you're going into the experience set and setting and also your mindset. Also the, the state of mind that you approach these things can greatly affect your experience. Hence bad trips for people that have an unstable psychological state of mind or they try to fight the experience. I really wonder if these people are embracing the, all the beautiful concepts of Christianity, the love, the, the, the family idea, that blood brotherhood, the, the idea of brothers and sisters together in this sense of unity and love of the creator. If this under this idea, if Christianity is actually an effective approach. Well, I think, I think what your experience, you know, it is not confined to Christianity. What you articulated is just basically kind of the characteristics of a religious experience or spiritual experience without necessarily tying it to Christianity. I mean love, compassion, respect for each other.

Speaker 2:          01:38:59       You know, I mean, these are elements of a, uh, kind of the, uh, well, I don't know what you call a generic religion. These are elements of the religious experience. The interesting thing about the UDV and these other churches is that they have actually created a structure where this can happen. Whereas most religions, the last thing they want you to do is have an actual religious experience. I mean, it's all made. It's all set up to make sure that doesn't happen because it just experiences are dangerous as a very profound thing. You just said that most religious, the last thing they want is for you to have a real religious experience, so it's all set up to make sure that doesn't happen. Only the priests get to have it or that was the original thing, and then of course they don't have it either because they're, you know, I mean it's gotten a ways from that I'm missing is that that they original idea of the rules of Christianity might have come from that.

Speaker 2:          01:40:05       The Moses and the burning Bush, these ideas that are passed on, love thy neighbor, all that stuff might have been from that very experience. Might've been from that various that experience. But the thing is, and this happens, it's not just Christianity, it's like it's like any powerful spiritual technology. Anything that is numinous, right? I talk a lot about the mysterium tremendum, right? The DMT, the psychedelic experiences, a mysterium, tremendum, something that is mysterious, tremendous, terrifying, spiritually powerful and must be controlled, right? I mean, it is. All those things. It's too powerful. So in these, in these power structure, there's always someone who says, who wants to sort of put a collar around that, put a lasso around that to seize the reins if the, if you will, there's a temptation to grab it and use it for your own purposes, which is usually a man usually. I don't know if any women women don't seem to be, you know, that it's not in built to do the dominance thing, but there's very often a male figure who can take it. Any spiritual technology coopt at to their purpose, you know, which is often sex or money or power or all of those things.

Speaker 1:          01:41:36       Yeah. That's always a man. Now of course it's a man, dammit. Why do we suck? We just do, you know, I mean, that's why there's 7 billion people because we're sneaky and we get your pregnant. Okay. Sorry. That's pretty much yet. We're not, we don't want to be like this ladies. It's not our fault God, but it's always a man. It really is always a man. I mean, there's no arguing with it,

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       you know? So you get this all the time, you know, in, in any kind of quote unquote spiritual tradition that happens in the, in the IOWASCA thing, as we know, you know, it's not uncommon to sexual abuse

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       sort of very common lately, lately more and more so you hear these stories of these guys. Um, my friend Amber Lyon, had it had happened to her, like on one of her first experiences, Scott was groping her and where she was under and she's realizing what's going on and just realize like, this is probably how some of these people sort of like, they found this technology and you can call it technology if you want, but this, this pathway to this incredible experience. They provide it to people, but they're not really much in into taking that journey themselves really into exploiting this thing for financial gain and for power and influence.

Speaker 2:          01:42:54       That is what it's morphed into now that there's the tourism phenomena and all that stuff. So yes, they see it as a way to, uh, to exactly that, to power influence and money, which just illustrates, again, it's all about, there's nothing inherently good or bad about these technologies. There can be a wonderful thing if it's used properly. That can be a really terrible thing. It's all about the use you make of it, you know, the moral dimension that comes with, with how you use it, you know, I mean there are ios scarecrows that have no, I, I say they don't listen to their medicine since they, they do these things, they're not really absorbing the lessons that they should be getting from the medicine. Others do listen to their medicine and they're, you know, it's

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       not so easy to sort out who's the good ones and who's the bad was sort of like what you were talking about, these people that have this simplistic idea that all you have to do is get Donald Trump high on dmt and he's going to see the light. That's not necessarily the case, not necessarily the case. I think it would be wasted on him. I think we would have to do at least at least an indwelling catheter, maybe three hours of continuous infusion. Wrong, wrong term, intravenous, but it's very, very freudian decided to go through his dick. Right. That is hilarious. Not that we'll. We'll, we'll go through the vein. No, man. I think he might have nailed it the first time. Might be the way to get it, but maybe the way to get it to them as some perfect Russian robot fucked off. Just locks them up and you know.

Speaker 1:          01:44:48       Right when he gets inside. There you go. She gets them in full guard. Locks them in place and catheter. Like delivery. Wow. Yeah. Maybe they can program at like, like Dmt, like little nanobots that go right through the hole, right through the penis hole, right into the system. They just run out of her right in there and he's whole. You just takes off. But again, there has to be something. Somebody animated that have an effect. Please. So many anime. I know there's somebody out there that wants to do it the way to do it. Just some perfect, super hot. 10 Russian hooker looking chick. No offense to Russian hookers, right? Or Donald Trump or Donald Trump even. Look, Donald Trump was a baby at one point in time. You know, and you and I, we both have children. We know this. It's a delicate process of turning an adult, uh, making it an adult out of a child.

Speaker 1:          01:45:47       A lot of factors come into play, but almost all babies are born well. They'd certainly have their own personality in many ways, a blank slate. And so they're in a lot of ways, a victim of the environment that they're raised in. And that's one of the weird things that I've developed in my own self over the last few years is just thinking about people as babies. I think if everyone has a baby now, since I've had kids, I don't, I mean obviously I think of them as being adults, but I think of them as an adult that used to be a baby. And I never used to do that before I had children. I used to think of people as being a static state. I mean, you and I go, well, this is Dennis Mckenna. This is how Dennis Mckenna has always been, and now I go, oh, Dennis used to be a little boy, you know, Dennis was a baby. He used to, you know, and then he saw a lot of songs and a lot of things, but you know what I mean? Yeah. Like trump, he's almost as much of a victim as he is a perpetrator in a way. He is. Trump's a good example of somebody. I mean in some ways he's still a child. Yeah, I know. He never

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       really grew up. I mean that's part of the problem and everyone, because he has so much power and money, everyone kowtows to his impulses, but you know, I mean somebody like jared and Ivanka or maybe a stabilizing influence on him, old or older, even though I'm sure their agenda is totally evil as well. Confused. No, they definitely don't deserve the amount of power that they're wielding, nor does anybody. What's more fascinating about him than anything is that what he holds up to the golden standard is success, right? I mean this is the guy that, you know, everything has to have his name on it. So trump this and trump that, and if you looked at the great American vision of success, it's to become some sort of super rich ultra billionaire, but even though everybody knows he's the super rich ultra billionaire, he still is deceptive about his own success.

Speaker 2:          01:47:42       He still has to lie about it. He still has to distort it far past, whether it's the numbers that came to the inauguration, whether it's the numbers that he won the electoral college by. He lies about all these different things and it's an. It's inherent. It's a part of him. This intense lack of satisfaction with any result, any result, even if it's winning by a mile, he must win by 100 miles. Right? You know, and that's childish. That's like an intense, but it's that same intense dissatisfaction that's inherently very dangerous in a leader because it's leading him to make these, these critical judgments that aren't based entirely unreality, but rather what he wants people to perceive. Right. That, that's quite right. I think that's dangerous. That's what we were saying before, no thoughtfulness, there's no thoughtfulness and the man, there's no reflection, reflection, a lack of humility.

Speaker 2:          01:48:38       So this is a, this is not what you want in your leaders because we see what's happening. Like, no, he's going back and forth with the Soviets is going back and forth with North Korea and it's like a schoolyard spot, you know, but these people have nuclear weapons to throw. So we need to back off from that. Donald, you know, it's just. But he can't do that because he has to respond. He has this impulse to respond. I mean, I think that, uh, you know, I don't know. I mean if he's not going to be exposed to, I was pretty sure unfortunately because it would help him and you know, what, what is disturbing to me. Many things about donald and this sort of reality distortion and has created his people, you know, they take it seriously. I mean they're sort of like intimidated by it. Not enough people are standing up and saying, well this is not true. This is not true. You're completely diluted about this here. You know, I mean there's a some sort of impulse to show some respect

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       when no respect is, is do you know, respect for the office, for the office, for whatever, some, but then when he comes out with these things that are obviously not true, I'm sorry, there are no alternative facts. Alternative facts are lies as our candy coating of Bullshit alternative facts is the muscle areas, candy coating of bullshit ever. My, my hope is that we get through this without nuclear war and then we realized that we can't have a fucking president and the idea of having one alpha champ run the entire group of 300 plus million people is insane and it doesn't work when you have technology, when you have this ability to communicate instantaneously, globally with everybody constantly. It's just, it's an archaic idea that served its time but needs to be revamped. How would you do that? That's a really good question. You know, I'm not the guy to be the architect of the future civilization, but I would think that putting as much power as we put into one individual is insanely problematic.

Speaker 1:          01:50:56       It's just you. You're dealing with all these ego issues, decision making issues, and also the camps that two separate camps, the right left camp. That's crazy too. That's crazy too. Right? Right. No, I mean I think one way to approach it wouldn't have to be such a such a tremendous shift from what we've got would be to go to a parliamentary system like Canada has, for example, where you represent your party and if the other party gets enough, they can vote, vote you out without going through the whole impeachment process. There is no impeachment process. The parties can form a coalition and vote the prime minister out, you know, and it's much easier to topple a government and in some ways that's a good thing. You know, it's more resilient and Canada's a good, you know, there are many parliamentary democracies, but that's the one that's closest.

Speaker 1:          01:51:56       I think there's also an issue with dealing with the real problems of the world in the time where they're the realities of say Syria, what's going on over there are so horrific and they're so far removed from the realities that we deal with here. You, you almost need to have someone who has some sort of experience with those people in those lands to understand and put it into perspective and I think we're entirely lacking of that perspective. Like in terms of our culture, I don't think we understand what a brutal military military dictatorship is like. I think we see it on television and it seems almost too abstract, but the president has to deal with that in a, in a very real way

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       and no one person can, but that's what advisors are for. Exactly. But if you don't have good advisors or if you choose to ignore them, then you're in deep shit. Right? I mean, I mean donald appoints advisors who already share his delusions of course. So there's nobody there to say, wait a minute, you're wrong. You know, and based on experience and expertise and all this, you're wrong and you need to rethink it. That's what bothers me about one among many things about the way that he proceeds. I mean, the thing that bothers me most about the change in administrations is that they basically looked at climate change. They said, we don't believe it. It's not happening. We're not. It's not even on the table, and actually that needs to be the thing on the table. That should be the primary thing we're talking about. All this other stuff is important, but we're talking about the accelerating changes that are, that are essentially under, under mining the mechanisms that keep the earth habitable by life.

Speaker 2:          01:54:00       This is a pretty important issue. And to have people that say, well, it isn't. We don't believe in climate change. Well I'm sorry, climate change is real. I don't care what the fuck you believe it is real and free for this administration to not only ignore it, but then roll back all these other measures that were put into place is a, you know, it's just the stupidest idea. I couldn't imagine not just roll back, but removing the funding for monitoring removing is really scary. Suppressing the inflammation and all this. So, you know, if you look at the people in the, in the trump administration, they're either from the energy industry, Rex Tillerson, you know, I think the government has become essentially a subsidiary of Exxonmobil and not the other way around. And so, you know, that's uh, that's what they're doing. And that's terrifying. You know, it's Goldman Sachs or Exxon Mobil.

Speaker 2:          01:54:59       I mean, corporations around the world. We've known this for a long time. Governments are just, puppets does this. In some ways it's just too eerily parallel to what we're talking about, what the rainforest, like with all these, all this potential in the rainforest and almost this race, the race to see like, can we get to these incredible new plants that we haven't discovered before? We fuck it up by cutting down all the hardwoods and burning all the forest. Can we get to this potential future utopia of people being able to read each other's minds. Being able to communicate simultaneously all throughout the winter, understanding each other regardless of language. Can we get to that before we blow up, before we

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       get into a nuclear war with North Korea? And it is crazy shit, right? This insane administration that's existing in this sort of chaotic manner alongside some of the brightest minds and most innovative people that have ever walked the face of the planet that are influencing things in a way today that it's really unparalleled in terms of human history, the potential that any new invention or innovation can enact, whether it's understanding new compounds that we discovered in the rain forest or some new technology that's made in Silicon Valley. I mean, it's an amazing, amazing parallel. Yeah, no, I agree. It does seem like it does seem like a race in some ways between idiocy and genius. They're incredibly brilliant people and they're developing. I mean, there are solutions to the problems that face us. Right? But they have on the other side, you have the know nothings, you know, who are marching into the future, eyes firmly fixed on the rear view mirror.

Speaker 1:          01:56:43       It's like, oh yeah, coal technology. That's the greatest thing. Let's go back to that. I mean, is that stupid or what? You know, cold technology is obsolete. It's stupid and you know, there are better solutions, you know, or the whole attitude towards drugs. Oh, the war on drugs. The war on drugs was great. Let's go back to that. I mean these are people who are not living in the present for one thing, not planning for the future and they don't really want to know. It's like our minds are made up. We know drug abuse has got to be bad, so let's prohibit it. Let's go back to the old model. They're not capable of entertaining a new ideas and that's a problem. You know, what do you think about the idea, and I've heard this brought up and I've, I've entertained at my own self that maybe we need some sort of enemy or some sort of thing to resist in order to rise to the full potential of innovation, of ideas of that we almost need some sort of mountain to conquer.

Speaker 1:          01:57:43       We need some sort of a force to be aware of. It really makes people rise up, but I've seen more, more people politically active and politically engaged now post election than I ever did before the election because I didn't expect trump to win. Right. And now that he did, it's like it's raised up this resistance to this insane level that I've never experienced before in my life. I mean, it feels to me like Kent State all over again. It feels to know where it was a real shock that he won. And it's, it. I agree. It's been a wake up call. So now there is this strong resistance, um, movement, um, and there. And that's a good thing that that's happened at also journalism. How suddenly found itself again, you know, some journalists, some sectors of it are beginning to, you know, for so long they were essentially stenographers. They would repeat whatever the mouthpieces, the government.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       Now the journalists are questioning everything and asking tough questions of these clowns. I'm expecting answers and it's kind of like, you know, when I was young, I wanted it to be a journalist, right? I thought Walter cronkite was the cat's pajamas. I wanted to be like him, I wanted or I wanted it to be a foreign correspondent. I just admire journalism and for a long time I have not found anything to admire in it. It's like they're, they've all been lobotomized or something, but they're rediscovering it, you know, the good ones are rediscovering it and the reemergence of investigative journalism. And right now I think that's the, you know, that's our best hope because I think that, uh, these guys, they'll just keep digging. There's going to be so much bad stuff come up about trump and the oldest collusion with the Russians and, you know, um, potentially enough to impeach him.

Speaker 2:          01:59:40       The question is, will the Republicans find enough spine to, uh, you know, to do that. But they did with Nixon. Yeah. You know, and I think some, I mean, what he did was not nearly as bad as what trump is doing and so we'll see where it goes, but shameless in a way that Nixon never watch shameless. And, and, uh, you know, I, I take a certain comfort in the thought that, uh, you know, they have all these draconian things. They want to do a rollback, all the environmental regulations, whole immigration thing, uh, you know, a war on drugs, but none of it is going to happen. None of it actually will happen with the immigration stuff is pretty real here in California. I mean, they, I see he is showing up at home depots. They showed up at home people's.

Speaker 1:          02:00:32       I have a friend who was born in America, he's Mexican and they asked him where he was born. They pulled me, he's a veteran and he knew like how to deal with this and he knew what's legal and what's not. And you know, it's a grown man. He's in his fifties and the citizen citizen and a veteran, he served the country in Iraq. And so they're coming up to him and ask him, where are you born? And he's like, you can't ask me that. Know was like, you don't, you're not allowed to ask me where I'm born. And then, you know, he says, who are you? And what were immigration and whatever the ice stands for, and he goes, let me see some documentation, and the guy shows him his badge and his gun. He goes, that's not your fucking documentation. Pull out your goddamn documentation.

Speaker 1:          02:01:11       And he pulls out his military id. It's like, look, here's my documentation. This is me. Who the fuck are you? Why are you asking people where they're born? I was born in California. Okay. You're not allowed to just go up to people and ask them where they're born, but people that don't know that they're, they're getting arrested, they're getting taken and they're getting deported. They're taking people that are dropping off their children at school, the grabbing people and there's a bunch of cases of this and you're just hearing about the cases that get to the press. So many them that you're never going to hear about. And this is just rampant and this never existed before. Not In the Bush administration. No, I mean not in Bush. Senior immediate just didn't happen before in any conservative administration. They didn't treat it like this. This is a weird time.

Speaker 2:          02:01:54       Yeah, it is a very weird time, but I think it's temporary.

Speaker 1:          02:01:57       Well, I hope so, but what you said about journalism, I think it's important to point out that the. They're just as they fucked up, just as hard with the left as they did with the right. I mean they, they let the Clintons get away with a lot of horseshit. They gotta let Obama get away with a lot of horseshit. They, they, they said talking points. They were given talking points and they ran with those talking points so that they would get access to the president and they will get access to congressmen, the senators, and they did it forever and it wasn't journalism and you're right and they're the reason why this guy got into place in this, in this situation right now. It's just as much of a fault of them have not holding the left to the fire as it is to, you know, what's going on right now.

Speaker 2:          02:02:37       Yeah, I mean, journalism has a lot to answer for it. There's no doubt about it. I just have a, you know, maybe it's a delusion. I would just, I would just, I, I liked, I would like to think that journalism is finding its voice and finding its function. Again, it's function is to, you know, as somebody said, I think it was I have stone, you know, the function is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. Right. And that's essentially the journalistic mandates or express the truth and the truth, see the truth and form. Don't assume, you know, play the propaganda game, be able to look beyond it and they have to be in this environment and the, where people keep calling fake news. They have to be undeniable. And I think in that sense they are reinvigorated, you know, I mean that's one of the things that, you know, you're, you're seeing that's one of the things that the times talked about like after it was over, after the election was over, they were like, we are, we're going to reinvigorate, refocused our dedication on journalism.

Speaker 2:          02:03:40       And I think that's a good sign. Then the other side of it is that we can just, you know, the way the trump administration proceeds with all these things, they wanted to, the inevitably just get bogged down in litigation protest to the, you know, at some point they do have to answer to Congress. So I think, you know, I mean the wheels were already coming off before he even took the oath of office. They've continued to come off and it's just gonna get. It's just a sort of a degenerate into litigation acrimony and the ability to get anything passed. Uh, you know, which is all good. I mean essentially in this case, chaos is our friend because they won't be able to advance this draconian agenda. Thank God. And you know, hopefully circumstances will enable us to get rid of them quickly. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:04:37       I don't know. You know, I'm, I'm not entirely confident in that. I just. The whole thing to me when I'm looking at these protests, like what was going on yesterday where people are just beating the shit out of each other in the streets is people with red hats. Like the red hats are the bad people. It's so strange. It's so strange. Scene people, these make America great again. Hats fighting with people that are wearing masks and motorcycle helmets and their sticks and people were throwing smoke bombs. I'm like, this is crazy. I really never thought we'd see such a clear right versus left civil war. In fact, like these little battles, it seems to be ramping up and becoming more and more common and, and, and becoming more and more violent.

Speaker 2:          02:05:19       Yeah, it seems that it is, you know, but so what can we do? You know, we're not out on the streets protesting on one side or another. I mean, I, I, I, uh, you know, and then basically I think for me, I continue to do it what I'm doing because I think, I think these plant medicines are the single most important catalyst for changing consciousness on a global level and that's what has to happen. So I'm not saying I have nothing messianic about it. I, you know, I tell people I work for the plants, but I think it's valuable to bring people to that experience in a place that is safe. They don't have to worry about those issues. They can have this direct download with the mysterious tremendum, if you want to call it that, that can change hearts and minds. I think that globally, I think that Ios is a catalyst for that.

Speaker 2:          02:06:15       You know, why has it suddenly gone global in the last 20 years? I think, you know, I think that it's a sign that Gaia, if you believe in that concept that the earth itself is an intelligent entity is give them a little bit hysterical and is trying to get our attention, you know, wake up the monkeys and this is the way it's. So ios gives an ambassador from the community of species to what I call the programmatic primates. You know, this out of control species that, uh, needs, uh, a good talking to say, wake up your recognized place. You know, and you don't have to. Well, it seems like so

Speaker 1:          02:07:02       systems always tried to balance themselves out, you know, whether it's through warfare or disease or some new government, you surfing the old power or whether it's through predators and prey and there's always some weird sort of reaction to some thing gaining too much power and whether it's ideas or ideologies or patterns that they gained too much power and then something shows up that sort of tends to diminish that erode the very foundation of it. That's, that's what I feel

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       about psychedelics that in many ways what they're doing and even the sneaky door, like the people that talk about cannabis being a, you know, some sort of a gateway drug. It's not a gateway drug to the bad ones. I think if anything, it's a gateway drug to the ones that are going to change the world. If it doesn't do it on its own it, you know, I mean, this concept of a gateway drug is, you know, it's just stupid. In sense, this is something that the drug warriors have come up with. I mean, I'm here to tell you, coffee is a gateway drug. Probably chocolate ice cream is a gateway drug. We've all taken these things and you know, look where we are now. We, you know, so gateway drug, it's just the concept is absurd. What's it? If it was sold in the, in a environment where there were a choice to have all sorts of other illegal drugs, they wouldn't be a gateway drug, but it no.

Speaker 2:          02:08:35       Well the alcohol one is the most ridiculous one because it's everywhere and it's the one that inhibits your really loosens your inhibitions more than any other drug may is responsible for the most foolish behavior. Yeah. It's everywhere. You can get it at every restaurant. You can get it almost everywhere you go this way. Even to the point where it's not even recognized as a drug. Exactly. Cognitive dissonance for years, you know, the FDA could not classify tobacco as a drug because it was a different regulatory framework. Well, of course it's a drug, you know, and somebody said, yeah, it's the only drug you can use when used as instructed will kill you.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       That's hilarious. Isn't it funny that the word drug, I'm not funny, but it's, isn't it problematic at the very least that the drug is sort of this gigantic blanket that we throw over all these things that perturb consciousness, right? Wrong, good and bad, positive and negative. No beneficial effects whatsoever. And this is, this is another reason. This is another example of why this conversation about drugs is so shallow because we're talking about drugs. Completely scary. You say people don't use drugs. What about what about which drugs? When we talk about which drugs, because there's thousands of drugs. So which one are we talking about? Or we just battled drugs. Just calling them drugs is a problem. Could you call dmt the same thing that you call alcohol? It seems to me to be so crazy. It's just not a useful term. Right? You know? Um, and then also, I mean the problem that they're facing and that we have to acknowledge, which I've been saying a lot lately, as you know, we're made of drugs, right?

Speaker 2:          02:10:28       Drugs, work. We are made of drugs, right? We're biochemical engines that run on trucks which are neurotransmitters and hormones. And enzymes and all of these things and biochemical system, they're involved with signal transduction with organisms are networks of communication. They're mediated by neurotransmitters, neurotransmitters, if you isolated them from the brain, put them into a bottle and sold them. That would be a drug, will they? These are drugs. So this idea that we are inherently biochemical systems and people don't want to acknowledge that, but that's the truth. You know, we're made of drugs. So the people that want to have the drug free America, I'm sorry, we're made out of drugs. Drugs are built into who we are. That's why drugs taken from plants or from the outside have the effects that they have, you know, because they affect these systems that uh, you know, our, our big brains.

Speaker 2:          02:11:36       This is kind of a consequence of evolution. You know, we have these enormous brains that evolved very quickly and we like novelty. You know, we have all of these brain receptors. We like to. We'd like to stimulate those receptors because it makes us feel good or it's interesting or for all sorts of reasons. We like to tweak our states of consciousness. It's just built into who we are and it's not a bad thing. Well, this is a problem with the way you're thinking. You have too many facts and use too much science and you don't have enough Jesus, Jesus in your life. If you have Jesus, you wouldn't need all this nonsense, and then that jeff sessions would make sense to you. Right? That may be true, but unfortunately I don't. So yeah, I'll just continue to be diluted. Believe in science is so important, so that makes that so important that you embraced Jesus and you just can't do it.

Speaker 2:          02:12:36       I mean, I know I'm a recovering Catholic. I've been there. I know. I know the drill. I know the territory, but it's really. In all honesty though, it's so important that you are saying these things so people can change their perspective. When they realized that, oh yeah, we are really just water balloons of drugs were just filled up with it. I mean we're, that's what operates the whole thing. That essentially is what we are. That's what adrenaline is. All these different things are. No, I didn't say it first. You know who said it? It was Salvador Dali. They said, so how do you come up with the ideas for all these crazy art do you do? You must be on drugs, right? He said, no, I am drugs. Which I guess that put the conversation to an end. So if you think about it, it's quite true.

Speaker 2:          02:13:25       I'm speaking of are, you know, without. I don't want to get too far down this, but a lot. The problem with organized religion I think is that it denies biology, right? Right. The idea of students. Yeah. Somehow being in the body, being this chemical system and enjoying what it is to be that is forbidden somehow, and this is partly a reflection of our devaluation of nature, you know, which is at. That includes our own nature as well as nature out there. Psychedelics are the antidote to this, right? They make you appreciate your relationship with nature so they they can catalyze changes. A consciousness. That's why I say the most effective thing that I can do as somebody who's concerned with the planet is bring people to situations where they can encounter the medicine and make of it what they will. I know I'm not there to tell them what to make of it.

Speaker 2:          02:14:27       I'm there to tell them this will be the most intense personal experience that you'll ever have. It's up to you how you evaluated it and you can't tell them because in all honesty, you're still working out yourself and I'm certainly, I don't want it. I'm a big believer in use your own mind. Use Your own brain to work this out and that's what we have it. You know, that's one of the most important things about recognizing someone who's a, you know, a quote unquote fake shaman or someone who's using it wrong. Someone is telling you exactly what it is and what you're going to experience like no. One of the most beautiful things that psychedelics drugs, psychedelic drugs do as they dissolve. Any notion that you might have that anyone has a hold of this thing. Yes, very much so. That is exactly right. If somebody tells me I'm a great showman, I'm gonna lead you through this, I'll, you know I'm out of there because they obviously have not understood what it is.

Speaker 2:          02:15:25       If somebody says I'm not a shop and I just helped, I just held. I just want to facilitate, you know, it's the medicine that there's a shaman will say I'm not a showman. I just know a few tricks. That guy is the guy. I want a drink. Yeah. I just got a few tricks. Tricks. If you have trouble, I can help you. Otherwise I'll just step back and let you do it. You know, and that's, that's the essential thing because the medicine itself is the showman. While I have you here, I have to ask you two questions because I keep forgetting to do this. Do this. First of all, cannabinoid receptors, what is the relationship between cannabinoid receptors in human beings and the actual use of cannabis or the evolutionary use of cannabis? Like over the course of human development is our cannabinoid receptors in place because people have consumed cannabis throughout history or they had just a natural function of biology?

Speaker 2:          02:16:23       No, there a natural function of biology, like a lot of these things, you know, like opiate receptors, the same thing, cannabinoid receptors and there are many kinds and they're all over the body. They're not just in the brain, they do all sorts of things. They're involved with immune functions and inflammation and it's quite complicated, which is why cbd oil works and it's not psychoactive, not psychoactive at works on different receptors. There's at least three kinds of cannabinoid receptors and evolutionarily they, you know, they, they're not contaminated receptors. There's the endocannabinoid system. They are, they are responsive to things that we make in the body. Like a Nanda mind and there's another one who I always, which I always forget, but these are indogenous compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors, so just like their endogenous compounds that bind to the opiate receptors. These are peptides like endorphins and enkephalins, those sorts of things, you know, but the receptor is just happened to bind these plant alkaloids, but that's not why they evolved.

Speaker 2:          02:17:38       You know, they have functions in the body related to analgesias and sleep and that sort of thing. Same with the contaminated receptors. They evolved not because they were cannabis plants out there, but because the body made these endocannabinoids and they mediated all kinds of functions like Amanda, my, these things, uh, you know, can I mentally, it's a little different than something like a, like a dmt or Psilocybin, which work kind of very specifically on the serotonin receptors and that's how they mediate their effects. The effects of cannabinoids are more widespread. You could say more multi, multi valence is maybe a good word, but it's not because the plants were there that we've, all these things. We had this, we were neurologically, no modern humans you might say, and curious, right? Sampling and everything we could get our hands on in the environment, whether it's stuffing ended up, our nose are usually drinking it or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:18:46       Naturally you're going to stumble over these compounds because, uh, you know, the bio is, is these are just abundant in the bio. So it's not really a chicken or the egg sort of situation. Like what came first, the cannabinoid receptor or the consumption of cannabis receptors were there first. How do we know that, uh, how do we know that? Because we can actually trace, we can trace the phylogeny of these things, you know, we have molecular methods now where we can actually traits the ancestry of receptors, right? For example, we have ways to measure this. So, you know, cannabinoid receptors, you can look at the phylogeny and, and you know, they were present in the president in mammals long before we were around, you know, and Tryptofan. It's the same thing. Tryptophan, which is the amino acid we were talking about, precursor to many of these psychedelics, right?

Speaker 2:          02:19:47       So how old is tripped a fan as an amino acid? You can look back at the phylogeny, turns out damn old, possibly three point 8 billion years old. The genes for Tryptofan have been found in phylogenetic groups that go back that far. The so called trip oppor on. So, you know, so these things have been around for a long time. And uh, you know, in the most primitive organisms, you know, Serotonin is another good example. Serotonin is, which most of the psychedelics work on Serotonin is thought to be the oldest neurotransmitter phylogenetically older than dopamine and norepinephrine. Some of these other things, Tryptofan, Serotonin is receptors are very old, uh, phylogenetically evolutionarily. So how does that correlate with a runner's high, um, when, when people have this runner's high and apparently it has some sort of an effect on cannabinoid receptors, what is going on there and does it actually mimic the high that someone gets from consuming cannabis?

Speaker 2:          02:21:03       It May, I've heard the runner's high discussed in terms of the, of the opiate receptors, the endorphin and so on. Maybe cannabis to what we do know is that in states of high stress, you can boost the production of these indigenous compounds, which is why high stress is one way to induce altered states of consciousness on the match. Right? Oh, I don't need drugs because I can, I can run and get high or I can do meditation and get high. I'm sorry dude, you're still on drugs. Cars were made, were made of drug and he figured out a way to boost your endogenous DMT cannabinoid. So when PA getting crazy, they're actually in some way doing some sort of a natural drug trip. Yeah. Essentially, because we are drugs, there is no state you can experience including the state that we're in right now, that is not a reflection of our neurochemistry.

Speaker 2:          02:22:10       We're in a hallucination right now. This is a, you know, this is a reality that our brains take information in from the environment through our sensory neural interface. They combine it with what we know from memories and associations and the Cortex, and they essentially create a model of reality and that's the reality we're inhabiting, you know, and a lot of what the brain does, it receives information, but a lot of the brain's function is to filter stuff out. You know, if we received everything from the environment all the time, we'd be nuts. We wouldn't be able to take it. So there are these gating mechanisms, it's called neural gating and we are genetically programmed to and through experience as well, to, uh, to have these gating mechanisms that filters a lot of stuff out so that we can function. Otherwise reality would be a blooming buzzing confusion all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:23:13       We wouldn't be able to focus on anything, you know. So a lot of. So for example, gating is, you know, it's malleable, it can change depending on the input. So you're in a crowded restaurant for example, and there's, it's hard to hear, there's a lot of noise in the background. You adapt to that by filtering out most of what's there, right? You just, you can suppress it to some degrees so you can talk to the person across from you, right? You're not paying attention. But at the next table you hear somebody say your name, suddenly you're gating mechanism, you know, you get that, that gets through the filtering mechanism itself. Somebody is talking to me, I wonder what they're saying about me over there, you know, that kind of thing. So it relates, but a lot of what the brain does when you essentially create this hallucination, if you want to call it that, a, of the reality that we inhabit, you can call it a model of reality.

Speaker 2:          02:24:16       It's not reality itself. It's a reasonable facsimile of reality that we inhabit and everybody's is different. Hence different views. Everyone is different, but close enough that we can talk to each other and all that. It's, you know. But it's not the pure objective reality, you know, which doesn't really exist. Well it exists out there, but we don't know what it looks, but it doesn't exist to humans doesn't exist to us. We don't perceive it. We receive our own art, you know, our own a model essentially of reality and I think you explaining that different experiences create literally drug trips also can explain love affairs where people become incredibly addicted to each other and addicted to the experience of being around the person and what that does to you and that literally you are on drugs when you were someone of course. And you know that's been studied, right?

Speaker 2:          02:25:12       Yeah. I mean oxytocin and probably opiate movies in Saratoga mean all of these things are part of what mediates relationship, including sex hormones. So all of those things, all of those things, sex hormones, tour psychoactive drugs in a certain sense, which is not to say, I mean this is not saying that these experiences are genuine or valuable or anything. They are obviously, you know, personal relationships are important. It is not a to my mind, it's not an evaluation to say we'll it's chemically mediated. Okay, great. It's chemically mediated. That doesn't make it invalid. In fact, it means that, well, these molecules are pretty amazing. They couldn't do that. Well, the feeling is fantastic. Like why would that invalidate it? It's still real. It's still awesome, but people, you know, again, they have these artificial distinctions about, well, you know, my mystical experiences more valuable than yours because you had to have silicide and then I got there on that couch, but it wasn't on the match.

Speaker 2:          02:26:22       You know, you're still a prisoner of your neurochemistry. No matter what. It just so happens that silicide been, is it drug taken in the right circumstances, in the right amount will reliably induce a mystical experience. Nothing wrong with that. You don't. You could even study it. Suddenly science can study mystical experiences because we have a reliable trigger that will nine times out of 10 induce mystical experience in the right circumstances. So then we can take somebody. Maybe somebody is meditated for 20 years, are done yoga or done other things, hoping that they might have a mystical experience, good for them, but then you know, you can take me an ordinary schmuck or somebody like me who hasn't particularly, not particularly spiritually evolved, but I can take solace Simon then. Yeah, it works.

Speaker 1:          02:27:18       That reminds me of a great story that your brother told once about a, uh, a monk who studied a city of levitation and uh, he did it for like 30 years and then met the Buddha and said, look, I can walk on water. I've studied the city of levitation for 30 years and now I can walk across the river. And the Buddhist said, yeah, but the ferries, only a nickel 30 years, man, you could've just taken mushrooms for speaking of mushrooms is this is something that I get wrong all the time. It's one of the other things I wanted to ask you. What, what is, um, there's some very close relationship that mushrooms have and the absorption of mushrooms have to dmt. What, what is the chemical differentiation? Okay. Very good. Very,

Speaker 2:          02:28:08       very slight actually. Um, the temptation to start drawing structures is almost irresistible. Write some stuff down. Go ahead. Awesome. Here has, do we have a visual? Now? We don't, but I'll save that piece of paper. Okay. Well, uh, I don't want to get too far into it, but basically. Okay. So you've had organic chemistry. Oh No, no. Okay. Well then this spam organic chemistry, you are what you are. Organic Chemistry. Well this may be a useless thing, but we could see it up on the wall here. We've got it up on the screen. Oh, there you go. Oh, okay. Well there you go. Yeah, we don't have to draw, Struck. You can look at it right here so you don't have to turn around. Look to your right Dennis. Turn test. Well, so. Right. So you can see if you've. So there's Serotonin, silicon and dimethyl trip to me.

Speaker 2:          02:29:06       Wow. You can see that silicon and domiciled trip to Maine are very close in structure. The only difference is that hydroxy group, that age group, that's the only difference. So with the silicon is exactly the same thing as an end dimethyltryptamine. That's correct. Why that single trivial difference is what makes tillison orally active and I'm a whole trip to mean there's not. Wow, wow. Because what's going on with that? This static diagram, the different molecular model would show up, but what's going on is that that nitrogen there in when tillison's and physiological solution, the nitrogen is charged, has a positive charge. The oxygen doesn't have the h there, it has a negative charge, so the nitrogen curls back and is in close association with the oxygen. If this makes any sense, so the enzyme can't get to it. That's why it's orally active because essentially it can't get to that nitrogen.

Speaker 2:          02:30:15       What that enzyme does is cleave off that nitrogen, mano aiming oxidase. It takes away that nitrogen and it can't do it with allison, so that's why I sold. Listens orally active. It doesn't require in them mail inhibitor. It's just in some ways it's the perfect psychedelic because it, you know, no preparation needed. You just bend over and pick the mushroom. They'll preparation is required, which is probably why very ancient man knew about psilocybin. They couldn't. They couldn't not have, if they were living in an environment where it was found. That's amazing. You know, what's really incredible is that, uh, people are using suicide and these days in what they call micro dosing, taking very small doses and seeing these profound benefits. And uh, one of the things that I'm aware of is kickboxers are using it and kick boxers are using it in a good buddy of mine is using. It says that he can see things happen before they happen. And like it was almost like he's reading

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       people's minds before they're about to do something even on micro toast. Yeah. That's very interesting in the intense environment of sparring and, and the, the intense physical Connecticut interaction of kickboxing is that he's seeing what people are going to do before they do it in a way that he's never able to do quote unquote on the notch. Right. No, I'm not surprised at all. I mean, and why? Why aren't you surprised? Like, what do you think is happening?

Speaker 2:          02:31:46       Because I think that, uh, these things let you step out of your box a little bit. They let you step out of your usual reference frame and notice things going on in the environment that again, this gating mechanism you were talking about, we're programmed to filter stuff out. Psychedelics temporarily disrupt that. They let the background come forward and you notice things about the environment that we're, that normally you would suppress because they're not relevant to immediate survival. I don't know if you've read some of the work by Simon Powell. He wrote the silicide been the solution. He writes very intelligently about psilocybin. In this latest book, the Magic Mushroom Explorer, he talks about how psilocybin is a lens. Essentially you can think of it as a lens through which you can look at the world. You can look at natural phenomena and you will notice things about that, those phenomena that you normally wouldn't overlook because we're programmed to do it.

Speaker 2:          02:32:56       So in a sense, he talks about how silicide but is a scientific instrument. You know, it's a lens through which you can look at the world and see aspects of it that are always there, but you've never noticed them before because we're programmed not to. For example, um, you know, Kary Mullis is famous because his discoveries in molecular biology, he attributes to his insights about molecular processes that he got from lsd that he could get down with the molecules as he put it and see how all this is working. And obviously he invented a preliminary chain reaction which she got the Nobel prize for. So it's not like this is a delusion. It's a real thing that he was able to notice that no one else, you know what I'm saying? He was able to put himself in a place where he could notice these phenomenon. And I think, I think that's really true.

Speaker 2:          02:33:51       If you, if you go to take a walk in the forest with an indigenous person, you know, who in some ways as in this less of this sensory gating in a more open place all the time. They will notice things about the environment, you know, that you are completely oblivious to until they pointed out, you know. And then they'll say, Oh yes, I never noticed the leaf cutter ants are behaving this way or these different things. Their sensory, a sort of experience of a environment like the forest is very different than ours because we're used to. We're just not out in nature the same way. And I daresay I think one of the things that in some ways inserts a barrier between us is literacy. You know, we're all literate, right? And we like being literate. It's good that we're literate, but in order to be literate, you have to have this separation between the self and the external environment.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       You know, you have to pick up a book and read it. I am here. I'm the point of view. Here's the book, you know, so that creates that relationship and you sacrifice, you focus on one particular sensory modality and you sacrifice all the other input that is coming up. I don't know if I'm making say no, you absolutely are. You absolutely are. But, but that's, that's what these substances can do. They can essentially reverse this background foreground relationship that we're so used to suddenly what's right in front of you is not so important and you can pay attention to the things in the background that you're normally your program to suppress and ignore because, you know, you have to be ready for the saber tooth tiger to come across, you know, over the, the mountain or whatever, you know what I'm saying. But, uh, it's good in that sense.

Speaker 2:          02:36:03       They teach different ways of perception, you know, and I think that's a very useful thing to learn. You know, indigenous people call these psychedelics plant teachers and they call them teachers for a reason. You know, much of the, what you experienced comes directly from the experience. But much of it also comes from your change perception. And suddenly you realize there's a different way to be in the world. There's a different way to perceive what you experienced that normally you don't. Uh, you know, we're programmed to filter out. I don't know if you've ever read or had Stephen Buhner on your show. No. He writes very intelligently about this stuff. He's written a book called a plant intelligence on the imaginal realm, and it's all about this, you know, this, uh, essentially let his rap is you can learn this, you know, you can learn this way of perceiving whether you do it with psychedelics or not.

Speaker 2:          02:37:11       You can actually learn it and it's a, it's an interesting. It's a better way to relate to nature or more an alternative way to relate to the insured in any way. I feel like we have these pre assumed definitions of things that we rely upon instead of seeing things for what they really are. And you, you Kinda, yeah. You box them up and you package them and you go, oh, well there's a car, there is a. and then one day you look at the car and you go, that's a box that has a controlled explosion in cased in iron and that rules on rubber tires and see exactly what they're talking about. There's a different way to look at things if you step out of the box. And yes, it is all those things and it's also a car and it's good if you did that all the time, you'd never get anything done.

Speaker 2:          02:38:00       That's right. That's right. But I mean it's interesting in that respect, you know, with psychedelics, because we're verbal people and we're, you know, were inhabited, inhabited world of language as much as the physical world and we're almost compelled to try to put some kind of linguistic wrapper over everything. And which is one reason why if you smoke DMT, right, you have a complete revelation. It's amazing. That's all of these things. But it's in most cases you aren't even down yet before you're trying to explain it to yourself. You know, you're trying to stuff this thing in a box because it was so impactful. It's inherently in the EFL bowl. You know, you can't really describe it in language, but boy is there a desire to somehow tame this thing which is incomprehensible, totally transcendent. But that doesn't stop you from rapping about it immediately to try to stuff it into a box because it's too impactful.

Speaker 2:          02:39:18       And so on the individual level, this is what people do. Well, that's what religions do too, right? They try to take something like this and stuff it into a box because in and of itself, without that wrapping or that linguistic, you know, filters to somehow tame it and, you know, nullify, neutralize its power. These things are very dangerous. There are, there also seems to be some sort of a physiological component to the, uh, the DMT trip where once it's over, you have a very limited amount of time to hang onto those memories. Yes. Well, exactly. So this is an attempt to entrain that, to grab it and I think put a linguistic, uh, you know, tag on a certain way so that as a way to not forget it or, or try and, you know, both reduce its power but give you something to hang on because right.

Speaker 2:          02:40:18       The memory and flooded actually is it's going to fade very rapidly. Why is that? What is, what's the physiological. I don't know what the physiological. It's like a lot like dreams, dreams. It's a lot like dreams. I think that it's just, I don't know, it's a, it's something like that you could probably train yourself to remember it better, just like people can train themselves to remember their dreams. Uh, but it, it's ephemeral, you know, it does tend to evaporate, you know, which is why it's important to go to the well once in a file and take a drink. Right. I am not one of these people that says, once you get the message, hang up the phone, that's a model that doesn't work for me. Actually, it might work for some people, but I feel like this is not, this is not an answering machine, this is a teacher.

Speaker 2:          02:41:13       This is something that is intelligent that you have a dialogue with, you know, and you don't, you know, teacher teaches a lesson. You don't say, thanks very much. We're done. Now. It's an ongoing process. I've been taking psychedelics for most of my life, a good part of my life. I feel like I've only learned a fraction of what they have to teach me, you know? Um, maybe I'm just dumb. Maybe I don't get the message as well as other people, but I don't think so. I think there's a lot. They're full of surprises. You know, I've taken Iowaska, Lux, lost track a long time ago, but probably 500 times or more and people say, well, you know, surely you've learned everything there is to learn. Actually No. You know, I always learned something new and I learned certain basic things to that. It always reminds me about,

Speaker 1:          02:42:11       well also remember that you don't know any chief and you're also acquiring new data constantly in the natural world that needs to be processed and sometimes you process it with the tools of civilization versus. Yeah. Versus the psychedelics. It's A. Well, you know, it's just interesting. Yeah, it keeps me off the streets. A lot of people can be great. Yeah. No, I'm grateful. I'm grateful. Listen, I think I've taken up plenty of your time here and this is an amazing conversation. I really appreciate it. Uh, I, I'm always happy when we can do this. I wish we could do it more often. We should do it. We definitely should. Let's do it. I can come, um, you know, there are many people I can recommend. I'm sure you'd get hundreds of requests, but certain people you ought to be talking to you. Let's do it. Let's do it. So please one more time. Tell people about

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       this conference and um, when they can watch it on facebook. Okay, well it's the e, s, p, e d [inaudible] dot com. That's, that's the key thing. Esp d 50. The conference will be June sixth, seventh and the eighth in the UK. You can go there if you want to attend it. The cost is high to actually go there and do it, but people could access it on facebook and if you go to that website then there's a link through to the facebook page and we'll be live streaming it, you know, on the sixth, the sixth, seventh and eighth of June at. It'll be archived. So I don't expect people in the states to get up at three in the morning, you know, to watch it. Although they could, if they want to watch it live, but it'll all be, you know, archives. So they can look at it at any time and will you transfer it over to other more accessible that people that don't have facebook maybe on youtube or something along those lines of Vimeo?

Speaker 2:          02:44:08       Eventually. We haven't made plans to live stream it on vimeo. I don't know how you do that. I think you can live stream it, but you could definitely take the video recording. Perhaps if you have a physical recording, it'll. It'll all be up there eventually, but just live stream real time. Facebook will be where we do it mostly because everyone has told me this is how you do. Okay, well I will definitely tweet that out to everybody and I'll let everybody know and I'll put it on all the available social media. Fantastic pages and and ordered the book. You can go to the website and order the book and the book will come out probably the end of November and it's going to take a few months for everybody to get there. You know, they have to not only make a presentation, they have to submit a paper for this book and I'm, you know, I'm dangling a certain rewards out to them to make sure that they do in fact submit a full paper in the spirit of the first conference, but it's going to be an amazing book and it's something I've wanted to do for a long time and uh, I can check this off the list now and go onto something else.

Speaker 2:          02:45:15       Beautiful. I hope they do it more. Thanks Joe. Thank you, Dennis. I appreciate you very, very much. All right. Thanks folks. See you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye.
