Look at this bitch. She's nobody's fucking daisy. Okay. She can't get a goddamn boyfriend. She's running around her because she likes. She cleaned. She likes cletus. She could. She make it more obvious. She's cut the legs off short so you can just finger her swing. She's there for you. She's. She's hacking in short. It's like no girl. Ever ever done that ever. Even now it's like God damn. And she was doing it when no one was doing it and she was wearing a men's shirts like she just got done fucking touch a man's shirt on like your shirt. She could be wearing your shirt buttons down to the fifth button. Tied off on the bottom. Come on son. She's got a man's shirt on. Why is that super hot girl have almost. That ain't number one. Bonus number two, dare you. You don't even know your history. So we're the number two boats. That's, that's him. And it's been a while. Tom Wolf, PAC man, that hair.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Those are the number two. No, these are still. People Go God, look at those shorts. Cry. She was hot pink. This makes me nervous. Just looking at him. You could see their fucking junk in their pants. Yeah, they're dicks was hard as rocks. Oh my God. And they're not even related to her because not. Does she have camel toe on that? She's got at the beginning of one. Just the beginning of badge. Outline everything. You could see the slice. Yeah. They had grandma panties back then. Oh, guess who doesn't care about me?

Speaker 1:          01:43          Are you a panties guy? What do you mean you like? I like when girls with dogs don't like granny panties. I think girlfriend. Nothing. Say it. Somebody got constraining yourself. So they were moonshiners with a heart of gold but never got any pussy. And they were beautiful man. Beautiful men and their hot cousin. It was a show where no one fucked. It was the most ridiculous world. That was way more ridiculous in the fact that they were shooting arrows with, with lightning, with a dynamite at the end of it, and they didn't have guns because they did time for fucking running moonshine, but the man should let them do what they do down here and Hazard County. We got our own rules, man. That was nobody. Nobody fucked. Yeah. You think fucking boss hog would have had a slew of hookers. Did she should have all do that, move that show now in reality like this is what it would be like.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Well, let's think about her. She was the only hot girl in the show ever. Look who she should have been one of the grossest women of all time. That's his wife. How dare you. How dare you. He would have been here for a woman in a gray color. Fucking or he would have been fucking her uncle. Jesse would've fucked. Everybody would fucked to cletus scooter. Boss Hog definitely would. I definitely would have had her on the payroll. She'd been right next to him. That cadillac with the bull horns on the front of it, but she came on to the other guy. Oh, she was always coming on as gay as fuck. And he was comfortable by it because Jesus was strong in his life. That's why cletus didn't want to admit it. When I was a kid, my dad was rich and he would carry like $15,000 around in his wallet. He's like ball and big money, you know? Did he have like crazy shoes? And like he wore, he wore a lot of like stupid looking silk shirts and shit. He looked like some kind of decadent Roman emperor and he always had like big orgies at his house to. Who'd you dad is cool. He was cool. What did he do for a living? He was pretty much a con man. Whoa. Really? Where, uh, he started as a diploma mill called Lasalle University. Did you? Shit, I don't believe you, but.

Speaker 1:          03:54          No, no, they uh, he just started. He started a fake university degree mill, you know, I mean, it kind of, you could say in some ways maybe it was fake or maybe it was just a precursor to things like Phoenix University of Phoenix that just, you know, but his real problem wasn't the school it, they've never. The government never went after him and said, you're running a scam school. The government went after him for, for, you know, committing mail fraud and for um, a tax evasion was the big one because he didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes they felt otherwise. So he ended up in jail for um, you know, three or four years over that. Well actually it was sentenced to five years, but then he claimed to be a drug addict even though he wasn't, never did drugs and they gave him some time off his sentence from enrolling in a drug treatment program.

Speaker 1:          04:43          God, that's awesome. He was always looking for the angles. I wish I had that ability like my dad did. Is he still around? No, he's dead. Is your mom still around? Yes. When you talk to your mom about him, like, like how long were they together? Uh, you know, I think about maybe eight or nine years. Wow. What a, what a blessed be like to be a woman and to have a child with a crazy man who's running around just scamming people and hustling. You know what I mean? It wasn't like he was really scamming people. He was actually helping people to scam employers if point they know that the degree is fucking bogus. Right. That's a good point actually. So they. And actually it was crazy because when it was exposed there was like congressman and you know, uh, they got their degree, like ceos of major companies that all had degrees from Lasalle University.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Super successful even with fake degrees. Yeah. That's hilarious. Well, you know what I mean. Degrees are bullshit anyway. Well, they certainly are not the only limiting factor in someone's competency. Yeah. I mean, especially not for like business or something science. Maybe that's a different story. Oh, for sure. Medicine. Yeah. You want a real doctor? I don't want, you know, a doctor with a Lasalle medical degree with an incomplete ideas. I don't think he, I don't think he, uh, he, he issued medical degrees though. Well, either way, that's not the most egregious example of someone being a con person. That's not. I mean, uh, there's probably way worse things, but you know what I mean. Yeah. But he was interesting guy though. Yeah, there he is. Robocop. Wow. He had a dope outfit to the new robocop. I never saw. I wasn't really into the new outfit that you just didn't see.

Speaker 1:          06:22          This is the new one. Did you watch the new one? No, I didn't know either. I think that is the new one. I met that dude. Yeah. Yeah. See why? Why does he have his hands covered? I'm gonna. Chop your hands off. We've got to have your hands covered. How come your mouth isn't covered either? I'll shoot you right in. The mouth. Will have identified the weak spots. Yeah. You don't want to have a, an exposed mouth hole. Yeah. Why would you ever have your exposed mouth? Yeah. He's got his whole face. His whole faith is ready to be shot because I'm assuming there's a brain back there, right? You've got skin, so there's no. I'm gonna. Shoot the right through your eyeballs. I your brain. So stupid. You know, like he's got like a regular human mouth. Why would you have that? When everything else is protected, you can't project. You'll have some sort of a speaker on the outside. There's so many veins and important arteries that run around the neck here. How's he going to eat with no teeth going to get shot in the face with a Canon in Detroit to do, you know, and it seems like the best place to put it in today. It is. Yeah, right. No one seems to have seen this movie. It must have been a robo flop.

Speaker 2:          07:23          Yeah, he out. He had it. He delivered it. You were stunned and now you're defensive and now it's not true. I actually went and saw the movie and I eat a lot of popcorn during it. I was a Robo slop. Come on, Robo stop. He doubled Queen Anne House in here. Somebody grab us a Robo. Oh, get your guys' expectations are too high here. Robo. Putting, battling, gross paddle, but red badges. One to year. I lost one to me. He did. Oh, how? Why do you keep making do with what I do? I go, how would you like me to react? I'll do whatever you like. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          08:16          Oh, la La, la, la La la La.

Speaker 2:          08:22          Oh no, that's the pun. Laugh right now. Could you imagine cracks upon onstage and the whole cargo?

Speaker 3:          08:34          Ah, LA, la, la, la.

Speaker 2:          08:37          That would be awesome. Dude. You're fucking manifested. You better be careful what you wish for

Speaker 1:          08:43          full, but you wishful young Tony.
