Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Panion podcasts. If you'd never heard one of these podcasts before. Don't expect us to even pay attention to the fights. Sometimes we do it. Sometimes we felt like, oh great, Joe's going to do commentary. No, Brendan's not doing commentary accounts. I do commentary. We'll do commentary because I know nothing about the fight. He'll pretend that he is giving strategy advice. That wouldn't really work. Exactly. But uh, what we do is we watch the fights and a, you can sync it up. Um, right now it's the first fight. Who is this? This is Hein. And we'll try saying this name. Nick Heine Verses Luke has said Jif ski to juice ski. There he is. There is, Luke has said juicy. Who's my favorite fighter who ends in a ski there? This is the first fight on the main card. Who's that guy there? The guy on the left. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Fabulous Viking character with tattoos. Dms a great look. He's not tall to thumb. Two thumbs go. People like me running out there is Lucas. And uh, so like I said, we, we will might talk about this fights or it might be diarrhea talk. Maybe you never know. Drugs and podcasts that you knew shirt. Yeah. Yeah. Nice fighter. And the kid killing it. Thank. Thank you. To Brenton shop, our design, our chief designer fighter and the kid.com I go like this. He asked me, I might pin it and I go, I don't know, maybe. And he goes, Oh, I'm not asking your opinion, just showing them to you. I don't hear back from him. I'm like, I have an opinion. I said, I said, you have the fashion sense of Anne Frank. Literally I was dead to Holocaust reference. That was, I was very surprised because she can't see what she's wearing. Very similar to you. Well No, no, no. Now you're, you're confusing and frank with Helen Keller. That's right. Fortunately why did you have oh wow. Shit and frank would be great if you were aware in Cabo. In an attic, right. And exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       And that's it. Yeah. Had, I knew Joey and I should have just kept my mouth shut. But the problem is, and frank though it would work within then frank because she probably wore just one like dowdy dress cause she had to live in an attic. Right. Or a year. Damn behind is ripped. Now he's a big kid. Kids in good shape. Yes, he has. He was in his corner. Oh yeah, he's a tiger Muay Thai guy. He was also, he was also a pro uh, policemen. Tiger Muay Thai apparently is, it's just a fucking bang and gym over in Cat Thailand. They just have an amazing camp there. There's a couple camps down now. Aka has a big kid. I'm like switch down there, right? Yep. Yeah. No I don't, I'll wonder why Mike Swick decided to move his camp to Thailand. Oh Shit. Totally. No, this is what a subscribers that's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:02:47       You get to see a nice surprise once you lock us in since you're the last one in, so no one knows who you go. No one comes in here and looking for, yeah. I think for SWIC as I'm sure decision, right. Like he was going to open a gym. And why Thailand? I mean he has a family. I don't know why the fuck you decided to go to Thailand. I forgot he had a family. I thought it was like wiling out on the girls and no jams. That sounds good. Can I hear amazing things about, that's what I hear. Amazing. And when I, when I shot a little movie called hangover to all the stunt guys and most of the just tough guys around. We're all professional or aspiring professional Moy Thai guys who spoke I think a little bit about training and Paquette. Yeah, that area.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Um, like I said, he's got that too, those two gyms and it's supposed to be like a really cool tourist area too. It's really beautiful. It's spelled p h, e t which would be, fuck it Tony mother sounds like a great plan. Lightened bitches on fire last night at the comedy store. Then shows up for the fight companion. Funny like he's in love with Yolanda Jerk Riddick I'd say Jerky Dick. I took the beat for that for the bonds. No fans. When you put it on the back end to have a boss right now. By the way, that's great feeling.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Oh boy. Don't say, but if you say Jerky Dick in front of Tony, he might get upset. I get a little offended over this. I wish we could. I wish we could respect Johana. I do. She has the baby. You should know how to say her fucking name before you tell people to respect her and Jay Check Yohanna Yohanna and their last name. Yen J. Check, check, check, check, check that she, the way she has it. There's like a little bit of an ou in there as well. You and jet check. I just call her JJ it friends. Call her JJ. Have you ever forgotten you'll do that college age? I made that up. Oh, you should get better. Like talking about Jj, the champ JJ, but he's gs marketing. She has, it's not even tough to say George Saint Pierre and everybody was saying GSP, it's too long when you have you ever, uh, when you call it a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:04:47       Do you ever guys guys, seriously guys. Okay, first fights about the star. If you're gonna sync this up, I'll let you know. Right when they touched gloves. Now they touched gloves. Yeah. So the clock right now, the moment they showed the clock, we'll let you guys know so you could sync it up. We call this Sara Lee. The Michael is feeling the guy out for 40 ushering, four 47, four 46, four 45. Okay, so there you go. Now you sinked up because the Internet runs about 10 seconds at least behind depending on where you are. The Ustream feed will run about 10 seconds behind. Great Tan on that dude. Can you tell he trains and Thailand. Lucas is going after it. Yeah, you can't help it. He's got a kind of skin it smolders. Isn't it interesting that like Tan like that is actually good for your body and your endurance and the way your, um, your, your body makes muscle.

Speaker 1:          00:05:35       It's anabolic, you know, vitamin D and your production of vitamin D at aids and the antibiotics process. That's why a lot of fighters get tans. I do. Steve Maxwell told me that. Yeah, but you were just sexy bitch. I would get 10 cause I'm vain. I get 10 cause I'm very vain. And you don't mind wrinkles. No may know on the face. He liked that fucking leathered old look. Well, I do dye my beard. My sister looked at me the other day and she goes, Ooh, your face looks like it needs lots of water. This is just me. She's hilarious. But mean she's very smart. Yes she is. Yes. You guys are get along very well. We did. We got along great at your daughter's party. Yes. Clung to your sister. My sister has one of those. She's pretty amazing. She's very smart because smart. Not sentimental either. Good. Yeah, she doesn't. I said you get hormonal when you uh, have your period Cheetos. No, and that annoys me. I remember when she was younger I was like, whoa. It's not a very, it doesn't have a lot of girl energy to get along with patty. Great.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       Very well. Call everybody pussies. Yup. Geez, that's too intense, man. That's too intense. Kathleen is not like when girls talk like them, man. Those guys of scary. Yeah. My sister is not sentimental hoods seats like, whoa, whoa. She's not romantic stuff. Easy bit. Some are down bitch. Someone's going to make you swallow your teeth. Cat. My sister, my sister used to, my sister used to have an eye for weakness, like if she saw a guy with a w what she called a week Chin or if somebody was sleeping with their mouth open, God help you. She'd be like sleeping on a plane. We'd be on our plan. Should go look at that guy with his mouth open. What a weak link. I was like, come on man. He's just sleeping. His jaws hanging open. She's like, that's annoying. That's your dad's barbarian jeans? Yes. She's all my, I call her I, the joke is I look at our go daddy. Oh, I mean Kathleen, they look alike. That's not good. No, she's got, she's got bigger bones. She was the Husky one. I was the frail. You wish you had your sisters genes, dude, I would get cold really easily. I had no, I had, I was so skinny and my sister was like, what are you cold for you baby? She has a full set of hair on her too. She does. Chicks don't usually go ball.

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       She's not suffering from male pattern baldness. What we're talking about. I'm like, she's a fucking war. Like I said, I hear on her, she also has a little Dick. It's got a tiny, tiny cock ball. That was a nice styles, a nice transition there behind recognizing that that knee is coming. Kind of telegraph that knee now ride the back but give up the position. Most small, small arms is short arms and legs. She's very muscular. He sits a rare look these days. Gosh, get your hands off in the lighter and lighter weight classes guys are becoming less and less muscular. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Well cause we got Caligiuri and CBRE on the car tonight. Two guys that were real thick for their way class. It's just super rare. Wait til this drug testing kicks in and it was only like gumby and shit. You're not joking to Kermit the frog.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       Not Joking. It is. It's very, very weird. What? What's going on here? Because the UFC is deciding to do it on their own. They're deciding to clean up the sport on their own, but it's an inherently dirty sports, but they're not part of it. Right. And they're handed off so, and you'll see, they can't tell him who to test. They're just saying, hi, you guys do it strictly as fuck. We're just going to stay out of it. They're telling they're telling the commissioner to do that. No, no, not a commission. I bringing in water that bringing the people that busted Balka the strictest drug testing in the world. They're going to have it year round. Right. They're going to do it randomly all year round. The five, five random tests a year. They show up at your house, three o'clock in the morning, Brian, get up. God Damn you ain't no.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       Yeah. The problem with that and awakened me. A Wiccan security son. Yeah. Hashtag rich they're getting, they're getting guys that are um, you know, looking in the middle of your sleep cycle, you're fucking up their whole day. If you could fuck up a couple of days of training problem, they could take a shot and maybe they wouldn't have taken if you'd done that, you know, I mean, they might be slower in the gym because of that. That's really, you're going to get a piss. I'm gonna Piss on your face. You wake me up at three in the morning. There should be, but they don't want to make it so that you could cycle it. You know you can get apparently Alex Rodriguez, by the way, this scientific analysis is brought to you by Joey Diaz told me about this. Don't take it with a grain of salt. Yeah, dog. They got these fucking gummy bears.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       Alex Rodriguez was taken gummy bears. He would take him and they would test. By the time he knew exactly when to take these fucking things so that when they were going to test them, it would be out of, it's just, no, he's right fucking gummy bear. He's right that he would do it and turn the game by the end of the game is if they test them as another system. How's that possible? I have no idea. I wish I had the fucking scientist. But is that still possible? Cause someone to get those to veto lunch yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       Was that the weirdest transition of bodies? Vito? Between Luke Rockhold and veto fighting Weidman. It's like what the fuck happened or or over him that time. No, but over him still looks like a stud. Like Overeem is smaller than it used to be, but he's still looks like a stud when old tour, it looks deflated. I agree. He looks like he looks like someone stole his meat over him when he fought Brock Lesnar I was like, holy fuck, you need to beat bright ass. Shut that shit. Oh hell yeah. It's called guys guys. Obstructional you beat Brock's ass and then just walk on over to the fucking, uh, Orleans casino and when the Mr Olympia like you could do both. He was fucking Jack. I watched it. I was like, Oh fuck. I need to find a different career or a different doctor. Holly, different doctor. What can I ask you guys?

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       Uh, I watched the Kimbo slice, uh, frank champ. I mean then shamrock, shamrock fight and him, Ken, him and Ken had him completely stretched out. When I got to tell you right now that fight look fake as fuck. That's what I was going to take that literally, that's what I thought was a couple of things I don't like about that fight. I don't like that clinch, that long clinch that they had where they were mouth to ear, they would amount to each other's ears for Nolan was really striking. Like if he's turning your wrestler, I'm popping those elbows and fucking take me down. How about the fact that would have stretched out when Ken did take him down? He never hit him once. How about that? He never hit him. He had him down. He had them flattened out.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       He had his back and he's not crashing them. He's not blasting with punches. He's got him flattened out and he's not hitting him. That doesn't make any sense. He's also, he also had a full, he had a full head to toe. I know, but he's also 51 that's true, and a fighter 51 yeah, that's true. You'd, you'd a hundred percent correct and I was like, I watched everyone, right? I watch all the [inaudible]. I watch all UFC, I'll let you everything. So the bell tour when, when the interest is, I was like, this is so dope. The, it was kind of like the pride and all that. Then I was on board. You have the, I was on, you had, he had big brown on board, but then when Ken shamrock walked out, I was like, what the fuck? How about the girl who was singing? What was that about? I don't know. See, I'm down with that though. I'm down with lights. His love for Brian to thing for me, when I walked,

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       he is a man. He's really tall and brow. No a singer, not like that. He's got great hair and a part inspired by the great Gatsby that would crush so hard. I'm working with big brown, his big brown, big brown. You could totally get an opponent's head. By the way, when he's laughing at your insurance, he's going to punch this guy in his big fat and take him down. Be careful of his game. I don't want a west side story and surveys. Just two is second to none. He's really handsome. That doesn't, he can turn on a nun. Don't ever play with me. You didn't even try. But shamrock came out. I think his whole family was

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       behind him. He had a white girl with the daughter and the kids behind it. Yeah. He had a girl that was with them, mostly his granddaughter or something that had his daughter maybe that had a kid on board until that, until that it was very WWF. The entrances to me, it looked the whole thing, the entrance. So suspect because he was shaking everybody's hand. It didn't look like he was about to go to a fight and it was about, he was about to go put on a performance nervous. And if you watched Kimbo fight when he was in the UFC when he was fighting like mitre own or Houston Alexander, that motherfucker's taking it serious now when he fought Ken Shamrock, he's talking to him in the ring before the entrance. No, no, no. The baddest motherfuckers on the nurse really don't talk like that, but they might have told them that this is the way to generate interest in this fight to hype it up all the fake bad blood like, and then the other thing that got me was the way Kimbo stopped share mark.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       That was real as fuck. I mean he definitely was crap. I agree. So maybe they made an agreement and Kimbo said I'm to punch this mother fucker anyway. Yeah, he was like, it's fine. Glasses dude. Um, but, but he did have him completely stretched out with what looked like a full rear naked choke. Am I wrong about that? Sort of, but he never went behind the head. Like he choked him, but he had it like on top of the head and sort of sort of weird and Kimbo was able to just keep grabbing up because it's hard to choke out with one arm. And this year, I mean you gotta you gotta be real mother fucker. Yeah. To be a monster. But timber just kept grabbing the one arm, which is the right move to do. But I saw, oh man, it was disturbing to me how easy Kimbo Shuck Ken off his back.

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       Like there's a lot of shit that I didn't like about it, that it was dealt. And you see their next card, they're doing a doublet they're doing, and if I call on it, Diamond May. I love it. Yeah. I'm on board. [inaudible] daily on that. I don't know if he's fighting daily, but they're both fighting on the car. I thought he was fighting daily. If he's funny. Daily daily's and fucking trust. Super trouble. He's in trouble. Yes. Joe Shillings. A tall motherfucker who can crack and he's been in there with the best kickboxers in the world and daily date. Yeah. Dailies really good kickboxing for MMA. But then again, dailies got that fucking ridiculous nuclear left left. Yeah. But if he don't think Joe Schilling seemed better striking. Yes. He knocked out, man. Come on. Yeah, he knocked out, man. Oh Man. I have kicked him and I can't imagine if I told him.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       Yeah, yeah. Watching those, those kickboxing fights where it's just kickboxing with huff his, so he was so devastating for a while that he used to be a Schilling. Schilling knocked out fucking Simon Marcus with one punch after they've gone to four rounds. Four rounds. Yeah. And that was the first guy to ever beat Marcus. Marcus was undefeated like 39 and then went to a drawl. Right. And then they, they had to go to the next. Right. And the reason why I went to withdraw, Simon had dropped him. Simon had dropped Joe showing, but then Joe Schilling, you'd come back and won some, like it was, you know, the way they do to Gloria was the old k one way where if they go three rounds and then if it's a draw, they go to the fourth and final round tiebreaker. That's a mother fucker. That'll fuck your mind.

Speaker 2:          00:16:31       Well, how about the fact that he had to fight two more times after that night? Same night. Yes. He had a fight. Fucking Wayne Barrett, who's a bad motherfucker. He had a fight him after that. And then he had a fight. Art 11 in the fucking, this is all just striking right up. Oh, kickbox gets paid for stuff. That was a pretty, pretty good pay day, I'm sure. How old he was. Just talking about how sorry was like for days you had hit asleep in an easy chair. Every time he'd get up he'd be like, oh, his arms wouldn't bend. Everything was fucked up. Just like getting hit and balking and three fights in one day. That's what that, that's way, that's crazy. He fucked 10 rounds, 10 rounds against three different opponents. I did four sets the other night. I thought that was hard. Can I be honest with you? It's like you're looking a little more vascular and I appreciate it. Weights. I got the kid lifting that squad Straw. You started when we were in Canada. The kids saw us with our shirts off and decided to start lifting. That's right. Brian switched shirts to rep you? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:17:35       Oh, nice. So all three of you played a part in it. Nice man. He started working out. Yeah, I had to. Yeah. He saw the kid with his fucking shorter. I saw that. It made me like really sad. Rogan's pretty jacked. Rogan's very thick. It's a lot. They like, I

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       didn't, I was like, I need shoulder surgery. I have a torn labrum. I hope. I don't know. So man. Yeah, it clicks and it makes them more, you know, the problem has been bugging me for a year and for a year I've just been pushing through it. Because you're an extremist. Moderate. I always stop Joe. Definitely. No, I called Brian the other night. I'm like, where are you man? He's like, emergency room, Bro. I got a sore throat right now. I'm like, I'm not making this up. He's like, I'm in the emergency room. And it could, it could, you know, you see a white spot that can be canceled. I'm like, Yep, that's spastic catch shit. Same thing. Or is it, no, no, no. I had, I had a, on my dingleberry I W it was a white spot and I was like, Oh, same one spot or a new one that I was the same one.

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       But I go, that's cancer and a guy looks at my thing and he goes, and he goes, this is, I was, I was so convinced. And he goes, Huh? I already, he goes, I guess that that's wild. I go, what is, he goes, you didn't, it's probably, where were you? I said it was in Costa Rica. Oh, I used to work in a clinic down there. He probably has something from there by just a self limiting virus. Oh, by the way, gone the next day. I think it was food on my tonsil on my thing. It's embarrassing, man. He was probably ate a chocolate donut with like powdered sugar on or some shit. A hypochondriac. Powdered sugar. Gotten a little thing. Meanwhile I pokes. I fucking hate them. Jesus Christ. While your sister has spots all over her fucking tongue, it doesn't do shit. A bitch doesn't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       She eats grass at me. Who's up some grass clean mouth. It's got green mouth syndrome, foamy green bubbles on the corner of her mouth. You chewing that cut again. Shut the fuck up. Pussy. Looks like you have your mouth open. You don't have four stomachs. Stop Chewing. Cutting's a special type of dude to be with a girl like that. Yeah. I'm not one of those guys tried it. I am not that guy. I've tried it too. I like women who are women. Me Too, like women who want to argue with you and they get fucking gangster with you. That's not interesting to me. That's like when I, when I tried, I had a little affair with growing the national Canadian water polo team who was so hot, but she went back, was thicker than mine and her hands, her knuckles when we'd hold hands. I was like, well, your hands are a little just a smidge bigger than mine and I have a big problem with that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       See, that's what I love about my girlfriend Yolanda, is that she doesn't start any drama or talk shit, but she, she knows her role. She's mentioned she'll finish it, uses it all up given chicks concussions. She's exhausted by the time she gets to you. She's very, she's very beaten pitches. I want to see you guys today. If you guys fucked, you wouldn't have much say in it. Don't need you lick pussy now. I think boozy, you'll come out of your fucking tired. Come on down. She wouldn't go to sleep. I know why they call him the Golden Pony. It's he's, he's surprising. He has a surprising dick. That's good. Is Dickie. So Bryce skinny, skinny but like me, but he's surprising. It's more of the ivory pony. I give it to her. Good guys. I'm serious. She didn't know your hair up in corn rows. Just I'd give it to

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       her. Good guys come. I wouldn't fucking give it to her man. That's how you know a guy's mouth. He started laying the proper, I was setting up for my cornrows line too. Good man. You know how I do it guys? Like looking for everybody to confirm my guys. You know guys, I would, I would fuck her. Good fellas.

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       The time I was telling her she needed, we haven't talked about this fight once. Yeah. This guy sergeant is actually getting the better of him right now. He's, he's uh oh there it is man. Highness slick. He, he's very aware of what's going on. Like when, when the other guy is throwing shots and kicks, he's, he's aware of like where the angles are coming from, is capitalized a couple of times on that. He's cardios good. He hasn't stopped moving man. He's not tired. He's tire. Roger Works is a good fucking trainer man. He's apparently going to fight again on the UFC. No, he's fighting on one FC last week. His last flight, right. Soccer fucked up. He fought one 72 and Roger's not, not even that big for one 55. Going to catch an angles. Look at that dude. You remember Roger Roger when he was in the UFC and he's like the poster boy.

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       He's the first one that everyone thinks Rhonda was the first one on the cover of sports illustrated. Actually Roger worked up. I'm great. This is my man over here. It's walking toward him to straight toward him and, and then we met he, because I think he beat, uh, I forget who he beat in that one. Eat a lot of guys, but he was front kicking the guy and who was the front cover of sports illustrated. But then he got to like big headed and he was like, I want to get paid, whatever. So is not just that you want to get paid. He started complaining about shit publicly, started complaining about the media duties and not getting paid for media duties. And it was like, what? That motherfucker disappeared. He made it. He said to do what? That's cool. Check this out. Shelf Ia for a nice young two years and here's the worst matchup possible.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Here's gray Maynard. See Ya. I'm gonna fucking went to Thailand. Last time I saw him fighting, he was in a street fight in Texas. Yeah, that was amazing though. The dude hit a girl. The dude hit a girl in the parking lot. What? Yeah, and Roger worked a pig ass dude and Roger worked a k. Oh this dude in front of a football player. Big football player. Wow. He sucker punches this girl. Oh, I don't know what happened, but this guy stepped up and sucker punches. Girl got his face and he goes, I'll knock you out too, motherfucker. Roger takes his shirt off and just tees off on this guy. It's like Goddamn action movie. The camera pans to the guy, pants to Roger moving towards the guy. Next thing you know, there's like a scramble people in front of him. The Dude's laid out and Roger soccer kicking him in the ass, dude. Wow. Did he get in trouble for it? No, he got love from the whole world. Fantastic. Could you get trouble for that guy's a con, right? He's a good dude, man. Good Dude. He's a great guy. Really good guy. He just had the wrong people in his ear. He's, oh, he's on. He came and he was in Denver for a while. I remember training with us and he was always just the fucking just bra man. His

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       boy one. Yeah. Well he's, he's taken a lot of punishment in his career, man. He tried being an APP. Yeah. Well that was the thing. He was dating that Laura prepon.

Speaker 2:          00:23:54       Yeah. From that 70 [inaudible] show. Yeah. And a, I think she probably got in his head and she was like the first celebrity I saw. I thought Rogers. So Cause Marty, how's it go? Shit. Dan Hardee. Jesus Christ. No Guy's, he looks like Tom Hardy though. Cause Tom is also playing a character like this. So there's Roger. Look at handsome bastard. I'm look at him. Yeah, he's a fucking ladies' man. I've ever seen one kit to stud. They tried doing the whole acting thing in fine. They get you man. They get you. Dan Hardee gave that dude the Mike can't do that. That's frowned upon Dan hard. He's going to be slapped when he goes. What is this speech? This guys can't do this. It's about to start a revolution of some kinds of shit. I'm on. It sounds like Hitler. Mine comp. Yeah. He's the only thing with his hand. This is intense. This some fight this on bypass shit. Hey, there's some fipass shit man grabbed up. Take that mic Dan Hardee who gets taller than I thought 1,000 just give him that mic. What's stretch? I mean that's a big no, no, right Joe do that. You can then very rare occasions I hi guys on a trust. You know, mentally like really hard to share a mic with anyone ever. You know when it's your role when you're in control, but it's a difference

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       [inaudible] because when I'm doing interviews like you never, I very, I'm, I have no personality when I'm doing interviews, my personality, my or my interviews are all about trying to get the most out of the fighter. I just tried to ask him question and give them the opportunity to express themselves. But you very, I've, I don't interject very much. Most of what I do, I'll give them a little enthusiasm, tell them how exciting it was and how awesome ones, but my goal is 100% while I'm doing interviews is to try to get that guy to express himself. That's why when I, when I've tried to give people advice about, you know, I've had a lot of guys ask me like, what do you do? How do I give interviews? That's my scariest part a lot. A lot of these guys are real nervous about interviews because it's live.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       You don't know exactly what to say and you kind of ad libbing it in the moment. I'm like, the most important thing is it's not you, it's not about you. It's all about trying to get the most out of that guy. This is his moment. What he was thinking, how it feels to be a champion. All that does. Is it surprising? Um, give us your thoughts. I want to know how a guy feels afters cause sometimes a guy will say, you know what man, from the second round my hand was broken and uh, you know, I tried to eat and you don't know, right? Like you have to, you have to ask. Like, how do you feel like, what happened? What was it like? Was anything surprising?

Speaker 2:          00:26:28       You can't give him the mic. Don't give me the mic. I like, Yo God, Tfa tek.com blog gets everyone. Was your, were you, um, I'm surprised at the, uh, Cain Velasquez? Uh, no I wasn't. I wasn't, I wasn't surprised when I thought about it afterwards. While it was happening, I was like, whoa, this is crazy. But you can't just go up to 7,500 feet above sea level and expect to keep your cardio. Especially when you haven't fought in two fucking years. Man, you just haven't fought. I see. I think that's a good point. You can't do that. However you don't become a multi time world champ and not know that that's an issue. And I think his issues are way beyond that. I think he realized that, I think they could have fought in fucking la at sea level and he would have looked like that. Really?

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       Yeah. I think, I think [inaudible] a bad example. You don't get to his level without assuming that. I think it's a cop out. I gotta be honest. Wow, that's interesting. So what do you think is going on, do you think for you were doing, just got that much better do you think came to slipping? I think for doom got that much better. And I think Kane has had damn near two years off and he's taken a lot of punishment, man and good points. And with these injuries. It's not like, you know how it goes, man, when you have something to drink can still work on stuff and continue to get better. Two years off of with surgeries and Rehab, two years in MMA, the UFC, the game's changing fast as fuck man. Like even now, I haven't fought since December. If I fought at then this next December with a year off, the games changed little over two years and then you're fighting a motherfucker and for doom who's been activists fucking getting better and better and then, and he's tall and he's got long reach.

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       Don't want to take them down. Enjoy that. So what are you going to do now? And he got strangled. I mean, that's what it was, which is actually better for him. You know, he was getting fucked up on his feet. He was about to get knocked out. He's about for doing. He was wobbling all over the place. I would imagine if you were getting ready for her doom in your Cain Valasquez, your coach says, never shoot a sack. Double leg. Only a single know his coach was to Javier Vasquez for versatile or Javier Mendez rather who, first of all, it was a fantastic coach. Yes, it doesn't have a background is grappling. Black belt in Jujitsu was not some worldclass grabbed her. Right. I don't think he's ever rolled with a guy like for over doing. Have you never rolled the guy who has a fucking nasty guard look for doom guys, you don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       You can't take that guy down, right? You can, but there has to be. You have to bring in a guy like boosh shusher to get you ready for, for doom. Shoot a single. I got them because they're going to different stuff to get ahold of your neck like you shouldn't see you like on a high level guide Jitsu guy. He's going to get a hold of your neck, but you can pass and still taking the matter to shit is in the first round. Yes. Well he loves his head on the outside. Knows that problem has to be on the incident. Your head has to be pinned to the chassis. You should a double on a guy like Carl, like Fabricio, but for [inaudible] guard is so fucking good unless you bring in a Vinnie Magallanes or someone who's got like a commensurate guard. Good luck being able to defend against him because he's got hit. That double leg was desperation. You can see him exhausted. Have you ever seen change Cain? Cain shoot such a shitty double and he was just exhausted and then first of all it's his technique was shit, right? You see him over his, he leans, he he liked leans over and over. Dunamis is fucking promo. Turn his volume of Jamie. Best Promo ever. This is, this is amazing fucking Promo.

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       I'm so fucking pumped things. Me and Eddie got a crown on this fella, Hon. Do you guys better grant? Who'd you buy? Really? Ooh, I'm rooting for Connor though. I love that guy. He walks even. It's so cool. It's just a cocky fuck. Like I love it. This is such a great commercial commercial, by the way. Cost $1 million. Look at those eyes. What a great fucking commercial.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       God Damn. July 11 hurry up and get here. Please say what was it cheap is using that Jay z song? They're probably got some 900 grand than a hundred Ghana. I'll do that shit for $20 right now. Yeah. Could have sang the song for that Promo. That would have been, oh, I hope that's right. Machida and Romero, are you around for that? You in town? I'm in San Francisco at the punchline. Is that what? No, that's not next weekend. Callan. June 27th June 27th this is June 27 yeah, you and next weekend is the 27th around. I'll be in you're there to, to doing business. What are you doing? Business. What kind of business? The podcast sponsors business sponsor stuff. Meeting with sue sponsor, rearrange that. They would stand up. You want to see my work? I'm all, I could go up and do yourself. Do you have to set, oh, now the year, now that you mention writing, how much new stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       Now let me ask you this about your special, which by the way, it was fucking so much fun to be at. The only time I've ever opened up for a guy. This is the only time I've ever warmed up a crowd. Incredible. Like, I dunno, 15 fucking years I haven't gone to on a show and 15 years. Yeah. It was weird. Yeah. It's weird to just go up like that. Like you do it all the time, Tony. You know, you're like, there's a talent to getting the crowd going. Like getting into it. It was fun. Yeah, you did a great job, but that room is fucking amazing for a special. When I was backstage watching on the Monitor, I was like, this is perfect. It's the perfect room. I loved it. I loved the, I love the state. I love the feel on the floor.

Speaker 2:          00:32:03       I feel so grounded. Did they ask you to do, do, do you have more than one camera? Like how many cameras? Six camera. Six cameras. Yeah. See, I was thinking like the one camera that they have when you work there, you know how you worked there. They make a film of every show. Right. And the one camera that they have when you work there as well. Perfect. Yeah. It's like that one. I've been watching specials lately and one, one of the things that I've been coming to this conclusion, it's like you need one view of the show, like head on the way you can kind of watch a show. Do you think 20 cameras over kill Cowen? Six cameras. Well he had a guy with him that does hair, who had a holster, was dead serious for sure. Relax. I'm just giving them a, I was just giving them my credit.

Speaker 2:          00:32:43       You know, he's a good guy and whatever, giving them credit for all those people were in the way during the way of thinking. There's relaxation. If it wasn't for Brendan tonight, you probably wouldn't have been loose. Yeah, cause we were back there busting those guys balls. It's right. Like what you had on a Bentley belt. Little too much. He had a Bentley belt of red Kango backwards of course, and a holster. Any little cal writing eyes was like, don't fuck this up. See you went, how long he grabbed you by the ears. What did I do? Like 20 1520 minutes? About 28, 20, 28. But it was great. They loved it. Hell yeah. Was very appropriate and it was great. The thing we talked about, Kevin was so ready to just smart move to have uh, such as, you know, a way over qualified opener for a special, I mean it's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Joe Rogan opening for me. I had Joey Diaz do mine at the Ice House. That's says do it man. That's how you do it was bloody murders through. The thing was is I got, I go Joey, I can only have you do 15. Cause if you do, if you do 21 minutes or longer, there's no way they're going to be able to listen to me for an hour. And you have to be careful with that. Like you don't want that fucking like earned amount. Kevin Hart opened for you, Joe. I got three guys opened for me before when I was filling in special fuck too much. Yeah, it was too much at some times when I show we Dunkin. Oh No. Was it Joey? Ari, Joey, Ari. I think it was Joey. Ari and a red band. Did a set. Yeah, it was ridiculous. Two people. One person. I didn't go on stage to the hour and the show plus too much.

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       I'll defer your special. Yeah. Wow. And it lands with you. It's like you know when you are worried because you're sweating so much. He wouldn't shut up the second shot. I turned the heat off. Don't worry about it. Just do it. Show look. You're in a club. Yeah. No one gives you a club. You wouldn't care. Right. If you were just, it was a set on the weekend, it wouldn't even cross your mind if it would cross your mind, it'd be something wrong. I was just thinking about not being able to use the second take because the sweat was different on my shirt and by the way, don't wear a shirt like that. Don't wear a light blue shirt. As soon as I walked in on the, God damn it. I know. I always knew to wear a black shirt or best was in between shows.

Speaker 2:          00:34:47       They're like, Brian, we have to fix the hair on the back of your head. I'm like, no, you don't. You don't have to fix his hair. He's like, he's the back of his neck like the back of his neck just winding up. I'm like, no one is going to watch this fucking special and go. I thought it was funny until I saw an errant hair is here. Just sweating just isn't funny. Yeah. Back of his neck is just, the hairs is uncanny. So wet. I just didn't like it. I'm gonna call, I'm gonna call it wet to get, get a look at this Guy Steve Kennedy. Cause that's where every UFC fighters body's going to look like after drug testing becomes 100% implemented. We're all going to look like steam shop. I looked like Roy Nelson. Damn Bro. What do you want me to do? Yo Dude fighter and the kid.com shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       His marijuana considered a no, you're good. It's only the week of the fight. Yes. Oh really? Yeah. Only the week of the fight. So you can get caught smoking weed and they're not going to touch you for weed unless it's the weekend. Wow. This is the question I have. So you know how they say they're going to test you five times throughout the year. So if I fight 3:00 AM I getting tested eight or does that count as part as the five? That's a good question. That's a very good question. I think they said five randoms throughout the year, so it does it not count, you know? I mean he's bummed me out. One of the things bums me out is it, this is going to cost a fuck load of money to go after, you know all these different guys for using performance enhancing drugs. The fighters that money I, that's what I'm going to say.

Speaker 2:          00:36:15       Sorry. Yeah, it needs to be said, man. It needs to be said. Can you imagine if they started drug testing and standup comedy? What would happen? They would make sure that you were on. We'd then make sure you do it. You get suspended. If you weren't using cocaine and marijuana matching your suspension, Bro Plain you, they suspended you if you smoke pot because it made you too funny. It's definitely a performance enhancing drug when it comes to comedy. I write all my best shit on weed. By the way, I got these new vape pens, Goddamn to the pump. Dignity. Really? Who makes a big fan of vape pens these days? I don't know. Make some, I don't read them. Start Smoking that shit. You just open them up. Open them up. Why don't you make your own fuck. Other people don't want to get in that business.

Speaker 2:          00:36:55       That business is sneaky. Like you gotta be real careful because it's federally illegal and when you make a shit ton of money and we're going to come after you take it all away and if you're like me and you like to talk a lot of shit, some things he'd get up. Yeah, I'm kidding. People can get upset and they can find the fact that get an example of you and all that. Yeah. It's one thing if you'd like to smoke a little weed personally, that makes me feel, but if you're selling it and making it, then you don't need to. Yeah. You don't need to get in that business. It's also like a level of wealth that I'm not sure you really want to get to. I'm not sure you want to get to a level of wealth where everyone knows your worth $1 billion and you have to drive around with fucking garbage.

Speaker 2:          00:37:33       Like whenever I look at Lorenzo Fertitta and he has, he's fucking former seals around them all the time with earpieces Noz fuck cause you gotta worry about going to kidnap them. I can take an eye answer and being a sex slave, the dudes that fucking guard Lorenzo Fertitta or legit as fuck. Yeah, you look in their eyes and like these are dudes. It will kill you with a pencil. 100%. You, you know there's one, you're, there's a service as a service. Whether if you're going to do like a, I dunno, something like climb mount Everest or do some crazy fucking kayak trip or go to Brazil. You can, you pay a monthly fee and they will pick you up and rescue wherever you're at in the world. There's only a certain light, they won't go to Syria and they won't go to like Afghanistan. But other than that, anywhere in the world you're covered.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       It's only like $175 a month or some shit. Yeah. Good. It's got to be way more than that. No, no, no, it's not. It's only more than that. If you're doing some like crazy shit and you tell them ahead of time, but so membership, so what do you have to do it where Fr. RFID chip. No, check it. You have to have one of those satellite phones like those big ass satellite phone, which a small price to pay a pretty small. Now we used one one. We're in Montana hunting. There's, they're shrinking. What are we doing? Another hunting trip. Let's schedule it. What do you want to kill? What do you want to let me shoot some shit? Yeah. You want to get in? Yeah. Okay. You know we should get killed my hands. We should. Oh Jesus. He should all go to to hone ranch and go shoot some pigs.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       All right, because it's an hour and a half. That's great. I don't eat swine, but I'm down. No, I'm just kidding. I'll eat. I'll eat some days. Well, they don't. It's hard to get bacon because bacon really comes from an animal that's been overfed and fattened up. The pigs eat. Oh, that guy's lit. I'm not trying to eat a skinny plan. He's, he's got his, he's not coming after him. Yeah, he doesn't. His head goes up when he gets thrown him. His Chin goes up, but the pigs that you're going to get her, you're going to be way leaner. But the hams are fantastic. These pigs in such good shape. I don't like that. Wild as fuck. Now. All right. Now this guy, red rash shorts. He's going to knock this guy out. Black. It's black as fuck. I don't want to be no lag. Pig may see a white.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       Every now and then you see like a white spotted one or around one, but most of them are black. So you know what the demonstrating you and me is. I won't make them my pet. Bring it home. I have pets are ready. Thank you very much. You do have a shitload of pets. I've got a few pets. I got chickens, I got cats and I'll shoot some shit or oral all. I'll be like the dog he has won't need one of those dogs. Those point 'em out. I remember when I was doing Kirsty alleys, TV show, I went to her house and she had to blind lemurs. She had a Shitload, a Chinchillas who thousand dogs, cats, and she had a huge desert hair in the middle of her lit bedroom. It was fensten and it couldn't use its back legs, so it had to drag itself until you show how rich you are to people.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       How much random ass PECI. That's me carrying a bear out of the woods on my back. That shot with a bow and arrow. Damn, that is all man. So mixed on that in Alberta. I sat there that night. Brittany, defendant has a bond. You need to frame this. Let me say that. That's a 250 seat. I was there. I'd be in the back and here's Brennan tears. Just crying. Terrified 100 yards through the woods, over dead falls with that bear. I'm as crazy. No one's got your shoulder. Oh am I totally didn't get hurt. How much did that thing way to 50 my shoulder was hurt from more from is about that bears your size motherfucker. For real though, my shoulder was hurting. Benching phase. I think benching is really what I did. It just flat bench. Very young shoulders. Is that right? Inclined bench man or dumped just a well Subotica got the rear naked and one arm trapped.

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       Wow. Oh this is over because it's a crank. He's turning away from the choke, which is, you know as long as you could really pin your neck down. It's a real crank right now though. That shit. He's pretty map. He's fine now. He's more wrapped up now. He's more wrapped up. Good position on that page. I love that body triangle, man. That body triangle is so good. See I did not in MMA because how are you get, what are you going to transition? A blue belt can defend the rear naked choke with those giant gloves on so we feel body triangle can't transition anytime. You can really SAP a guys will. I agree. You can control your breathing, especially if you go belly down. Yeah. If you could turn that guy and get them belly down with that body triangle. God, that's so nasty. He gets it like Ken shamrock and now Peter [inaudible] bad mother fucker Dean list or in his corner that day and you know that motherfucker can't choke wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:41:57       Dean lister had been looking for his neck for the past six years. It's just find it. It's just head, shoulders. He's his thing, man. I met him at the metaphors. I couldn't believe how thick he was. Shy Has Josh Barnett tapped him? How about Josh Barnett tapped him to talk to your boy. He, Ron Dude Barnett Barnett, other the best catch wrestler of all time. All time. Really so impressive that it was better. He tapped dean lister and any tap here, dean. He tapped d. First of all, people say Dean listers never been tapped out in training and he's 16 years, never been tapped out in training. He's never been tapped out and cognition. Fucking ed, he got tapped with like of headaches, the neck crank, crank. He got him in that judo headlock. Fuck. It's silent Trojan motherfucker. See his next fight. Who was he fighting? Roy Nelson. Japan son.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Ooh, I like it. I'm not going to fight that or UFC like it. What'd you just say? Not Ufc or US close. Once you grab some bench, take a break. What are you talking about? To understand what the sport, I mean, fuck the UFC guys. I don't know. Look at Dean lister. I can't believe you've never been tapped in practice even. That's cool. Josh Martin. I said, oh, that's cool. Check this out. That was a slick move. You see the way he set that, that a rear naked up we, he, he made them defend one arm to sy. Set them up for the second one. He turned away from the one arm into the second arm. So Baba knows what the fuck he's doing with that. He like it almost like he fed them the one arm so that he would turn away from it and then slip the second one under the chin.

Speaker 2:          00:43:26       I'm not mad at that shirt. Very nice. Here's a little tip. See, I saw giggle. I don't take heat for this, but bear with me here. When Daniel Cormier, I saw him, he's The new light heavyweight champion, right? And UFC selling his shirts and then as soon as July 1st kicks in, Reebok's going to design the shirts. If I'm Daniel Cormier, oh, I'm Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey, one of these mega stars, why won't you have your own website and create your own shirts and sell the fuck out of them, reap all your own benefits and that you're speaking like a businessman. You're, you're a smart dude and you have the ambition to do that kind of stuff. But a lot of guys don't. They just hire someone to do it. You're right, you're right. How about you? Why don't you do it? Maybe that's a good side business for you. I don't know. I mean I would get my own shit. Fucking savage. You got a little too much going on selling about 8,000 t shirts and 20 minutes. I always text you right away like Joe, check it out.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       They'll put up these shirts for sale and self souses in minutes. And I'm like thinking about the numbers, I was just plus expenses. Holy Shit. That's real legit money and nothing gets me more excited. Oh, it's when they sell. I'm literally jumping around sweating. Well, when I was at Brian's, I'm taping. The fucking audience was filled with your tee shirts. Everything was fighter and the kid. I think you'd be surprised. There's so many different shirts. Crazy audience is amazing. It's really cool. He shot like fourth one's drop in our show. Dope. I love what you're wearing. An American flag type shit. Red, white and blue tank. And then we've got the master Kim shirt, but in red, white and blue. It's so dope. I'm like, awesome. Yeah. Anyways.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       Ooh. He handed it to her. I cooking. I'll tell him you did y'all. I need some fucking priming Joe Rogan shirts. I'm always rocking my winter. I kind of, I gotta be honest. I feel like a tool rocked in my own shit. I know what you mean. That's what I'm saying. You never seen me wear my shirts, nor do I even talk about them. That's a real problem. I have a Goddamn tee shirt company and I never had to advertise it like three times. But you do well with it. It makes great money. When I was talking to you, it goes all the time. I didn't even, I didn't even know he sold shirts. I was like, what you gotta do bro? You got to do this. You're like, motherfucker, I've been selling shirts forever. I'm like, Oh really? Regina has a pretty boxer. She wished she can't box. He's got teeth. Fuck yeah, guys, your boxes. Fat did badly care. I love athletes. Oh, I sure would show her a good time. Right guys I share with you guys. What's her? She pulls her pussy lips apart and brushes her teeth.

Speaker 2:          00:46:01       She gets a fucking one of those little waterpiks down there. Ah Man. I'll tell you what the struggle is real with girl. What is her name? Regina is, it is so real. I love girls, man. It's a fucking curse. Well, they're better than dudes when it comes to having sex with them. You got to do what you got to do. They don't. There's a reason opposites attract. Right. They don't look like you see it at what point? I just attracted to one. You know what I'm saying? Fucking curse. You feel me? Yeah. That's problem to being attracted to one. It's very difficult. Yeah. I love all different kinds of women. There's also, then there's also the problem of just getting along. You know, everybody has a fucking different sensibility, man. Men and women see thinks so goddamn differently. Different goals, truly different needs, different think different things that pissed them off.

Speaker 2:          00:46:51       You know what hurts my feelings is girls that I've dated before, we've, we dated for years, even lived together and now just cause whatever. We're not, you know, still intimate in relationship. We're not friends anymore, but you just get us thinking about the time you've not wasted, but you spent all those years together. To me, I'm like, no, let's still be friends, but they can't do it, man. Some of them can't be. But you can eat the arms. Yeah, because he used to send it in there and shoot loads inside their body and they loved it around you in the man I love you and they feel your back wall of the path. They feel that crease where the spine is and the the muscles wrap around the valley cause muscle valley

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       shop does that thing where he lies on his back and he puts the weight bar here and he does those fuck exercises load that puts them up on Instagram. 400 pounds. One more set. One more. One more Rep. Meanwhile, Rampage's trainer I follow Rampage's his trainer on Instagram. It's a woman with an ass created by God. What's the name please?

That same exercises you overdose of it. Videos of it. Undeniable. The face though, she's pretty, she's not ugly at all. She's pretty, but it, you don't even care. I'm going to slip on the heard them. Dean thinks she's married and she has children that had been there. Her ass is ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       But she does that same thing. She has like a yoga mat that she uh, has rolled up next to the bench so she could pull it up here and she puts her elbows on the bench cause she can't get under it. Like she's not as strong as you to get under it. But once she gets under it, it's on, let me find it. I'll find it for you. Yeah, that's fine. That the shell. Yeah. I get dead serious. I'm like, I should be on Instagram and you'll see a girl's ass and I'll be like, God damn, I don't care where I'm at. You just, it's like so frustrating. It's like seeing a dope ass car. Exactly. And then I'll go to their fucking webpage or I'll go to their Instagram page and you find out that they have 7 million followers can all it is, is pictures of their ass girls get way more followers on Instagram than they do is look up there. Yeah. That's her find the one when she's doing, find the one when she's doing that. A, that's a strong gal. That critter got to shit or honor. Oh yeah, sure. You gotta wait, check Jamie. Find the one where she's in there doing the, the fucking, oh, that's rampages.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       Well, she's got a page. What does it said, Juliet? What? Yeah, but I'm telling you that she has a page. So what is it? What does that say that they had at Juliet Lynn 82. All right. I'll find it. Hold on the sheet. She's not that. Don't, this is going to be interesting. There's nothing better than a nice ass. Hudson was this cat is this Seaver and Jerry are ready. That's the cove Maine. How the fuck is that happening? Are Ready. This is a short night. It's a great deal of, Ooh. How about that Forman Bella tour tournament coming up in September. I know, right? What is that? It's uh, who is it? It's a saw king, Mo and filled day manual. Newton King Mo. Phil Davis. And he's the last guy or the fourth guy? Yeah, he's a baldheaded. One night. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       one night, right? Yeah. They're all fighting one night. Yeah. Four man tournament in one night. God Damn you Scott Coker. You Genius Bella Tours trying some experiments. Huh? I'm not mad at to mix it up cause you gotta do some cause you're not going to give with the UFC count for towel tell you this, the front patio or the comedy store last night, everybody was waiting for that shamrock. Everyone loves Kimbo man. And it garnered attention and you know, I don't see the UFC up on that TV as much at like, I mean that often, but you know that gets, that gets a different crowd watching for sure. You know what I mean? I agree. I think they're doing it. Smart man. I've never even really seen Bella tour in the past like year until, uh, until last night and I was really surprised about those WWF engines. It's fun though, Huh? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       They're not quite doing it right? I don't think so. We'll see you Mickey. It is and I don't think they see what works about the WWF sentences that they're not doing. Like it's cool the production value but a little too much. Right. It's Corny as fuck. Have the guys walking in and fight. It's not sense the entertainment. It's not though don't it is. I think the UFC came to the right conclusion. They taught about it and they said, you know what? We can get more seats. We could sit more people in here without this. They're really great. Seats are important to get rid of this ramp and plus we're spending all this money on pyrotechnics and shit for what and then they decide to be awesome. I don't think it's awesome, man. I don't, I think the UFC is more, it's looked more as a legit sway, more towards more of a spectacle but it sure, okay, what do you do?

Speaker 2:          00:52:06       You can go talent for talent. Do you see this is what you do. You Poach. What bell torn needs to do is do some of that Goddamn Viacom money and take advantage of this, this route. Reebok thing, this Reebok thing that has a lot of fighters that are going to lose a shitload of money. Here she is. Look at this. Come on, son. Wow. Fuck did I say wow girls, no joke. There's a bunch of videos of her doing that. She, she's letting you know, man. She's t man. Oh, I would do serious things to her. No, you would fuck the shit out of [inaudible] and she would open up a window and shoot it and trash guy with her pussy. She would pull her dick off, pull your dick off with her vagina and this guy opened up the window sticker pussy. Tanium she'd kill a bird with it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       She's in. Shit. I'm going to start doing now is what does access. I've got to start doing that. What's the benefit of that exercise? Work your ass, hips and glutes. It gets you ready to fuck fat shall be good for your sprawl, right? Yeah. Great for your sprawl. Good. Good for hip mobility or look at that booty. Look at that booty. Yeah. It's a ridiculous booty. No, no, no. Go down. Scroll down. Look at that. Why did Jesus Christ? That's good, but it's black. It's hard to see because of the blackness. Scroll down a little. There's one little further, little further. She gets it. She gets up tickle biddies to that. That is a fucking validify booty and

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I'm not mad at that. Good for her. Congratulations on your wonderful body. Congrats. Yeah. Oh, she trains hard. Well, she's, rampage is a strength and conditioning trainer. I guess. Rampage has a gym. Yeah, he does. Right. And a Orange County? Yeah. What does it's called like Rampage's fitness or something like rampage for him. Good for him. I'm glad he's invested his money. He's still dealing with that litigation bullshit, right? With belter? Yup. What is that about? Bella tours signed him and then they violated their contracts. So the judge released him. They put an injunction. Judge, Judge List lifted the injunction. He fought for the UFC. Everybody loved him. Fought Fabio Maldonado. Great fight. And then they got a new injunction and so there's a new legal issue going on at the table. What? They had to release his contract. Revelatory. That thing was Beastie. Yeah. He's making a lot of money.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       Are you allowed to hang a banner if, if, if you're under the Reebok deal, can you hang a banner? He came to that sober. Wow. Not only that you have to wear Reebok closed the entire week of fight cannon. He yells, show up and fight when Reebok pumps. Oh my God. Wow. Um, you know what man, forcing me to get her Bible. Ted, it's an open Barb wire run your bicep fucking tramp stamp. I'd rather just get a Reebok trance. Then we're rebounding nineties tattoos. The um, the thing about it is that it's opening up the door for belter in a big way. If they can show that they can come up with a lot of money for you in a contract and let you get your own sponsors like the way it used to be, they'll change the fucking game because all you need is a few of those guys jump over.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       Davis was the first man. Yeah. But Phil, he was a, from all due respect, Phil was a free agent. With all due respect. Phil was not really a threat for the title. It's just not, you know, you watch the Anthony Rumble Johnson beat him up. It's, it's hard and Jon Jones is going to see Ryan Bader beat him. It's like, I don't know. I mean he could beat Machida and he beat Gustafsson. He did. He did. But he beat Gustafsson very early in his career. My submission. It's true. And that when a guy named Sheila with beat Glover tech, he said he'd be wrangled him a cheeto did and clover clover trained for that Shit and Connecticut and his backyard. I'm just saying literally beats it. I know he did. He but he beat some top top guys. Don't look. Phil Davis is a tough guy, but no one thinks of him.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       The way they think about rumble over. They think about Daniel that like he might be, you know, is a real shot at the title. So him going over to bell tours, not the biggest loss you're saying we need like, exactly. Exactly. Word Aldo went over to Bella tour. How about this? I'll go and Borow of Henan Borow how bout if Hanan Barao Beats Tj Dillashaw and then goes over to belt or, I mean that's craziness. If they get a few guys like that and by the way, they have fucking that fucking pretracheal pit bull. Did you see that fight last night and came back, came back and CalEd them. That was a wild ass fucking advice. Now I saw some good spots with a belt tour. Violence. See like any powerhouse

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       sponsors. I'm surprised that everyone's not jumping the train yet. They need more numbers, you know. And the last thing, he's good. Yeah, I'm sure it was. They need to bail on that fucking name. Bella tours a stupid name. Yeah, I'm not a fan of it. What does ballot tour mean? It's like like warrior and Latin or using a dead language about that tour. I don't know. Let's find out cause I'm talking shit. I don't really know what the actual name for sure. Switch it up. There'll be a little more professional. It should be spike MMA. I just like, just like, you know, showtime has showtime boxing. Hbo Is Hbo Boxing, MMA. Viacom fighting. What? Make it more professional, man. It. What is the name? Good. That's an interesting senior way. What I was right. Brandon, what do we do here? Okay. It's warrior in Latin. Dennis Seaver, but it's hard for to Seaver to fucking get motivated.

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       After Connor Mcgregor stole his soul. You see that fight in Boston? He looks so slow. You need to see walks so slow. Crazy. Mcgregor walked him down and beat the fuck out of him. I know you can't pick Joe, but uh, Tony, Brian, honey. See Connor, I chose a hick kind of go there. I, he doesn't know. There's no idea. I mean, if I had to really, if I had to really put you on the other line, if I had to put money on it, I would put, I would put money on, on Connor because I feel like there's so much momentum and he has so much belief and I feel in some ways maybe he's inside Josias had, can I, can I do, can I help you out here? So you think he has more belief than Josie? It guy was at Lawson did nine years.

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       10 pound best in the world. 10 year, 10 now. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit more belief than Josie. Elder look at Aldo has massive belief in himself, so don't question not better camp. All those beaten. Everybody they put in front of them. Here's the best leg kicks maybe in the world and now he's motive MMA. His leg kicks us. So God damn fast and nasty professional level soccer player and he has that ridiculous fucking hip snap because of that. Some of the best takedown defense. Spectacular. The only thing about Aldo is he's had a lot of fights and he's had a lot of wars in the gym. A lot of like tough rounds in fighting. You know that last Chad Mendez fight was probably the toughest fight he's ever had inside the octagon. True Mendez cracked him man to man his punishment. Yeah. Men has hit him.

Speaker 2:          00:58:35       Some bombs and men has can hit fucking hard man. You see that Ricardo Lamas fight. You see the hardest hit her in that division by farm and he cautioned and Josie Aldo took that and still what he says he did twice and I'll go drop them in that first round sort of illegal cause. Kind of like after the above is tough. The crack a little loud. She had caught Connor's taller and I feel like his hands are probably better. Well, he's never fought anybody remotely as good as all doses, not even close level of competition. Now that's true. If I'm putting money on it in Vegas, yeah, I'm going to Jose Aldo all day, but personally for the UFC, since I'm team UFC, I want Connor to win. If Connor wins, he's the biggest star of the UFC is the habit of Aldo wins. It shows everybody what a fucking monster they'd been sleeping on it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       Yeah. Right. But then what do you do with Khan announced a gimmick. We built, he rebuilds depends on how he loses. Here's my thing. I think it's brilliant that they have Connor fighting Aldo right away like this, because the reality is we have not seen Conor fight a wrestler. If you see Conor in there with a Frankie Edgar Connor in the air with the Chad, tough favor. Never. No, ma'am. Wrestlers can be a bit, you never know what they could do to him. You never know if they could take him down at smother him. Look at the way Frankie Edgar stole cubs. Watson's fucking Amil just stole it. Asher body. They don't want that cause that Clay Guido, Anthony Pettis, remember that you don't want that. And that's what [inaudible] did to him to this. Exactly. But does on with better stand up. Yes. So, but the thing is, it's going to be rough for Connor.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       As long as he makes it a fight, we're good. If he goes in and gets fucking dismantled, then it's like, oh my God, this shit talking. It's embarrassing. He's so big and so strong. I don't think he's going to get dismantled, but I think it's a fight, man. It's a fucking hell of a fight. I think Connor has gotten a little too confident. I think he's wearing sunglasses indoors and shit now his thing or the show wrestling fan, but most of those guys come in and sunglasses when after they have the belt, he's wearing the sunglasses indoors before the belt. You gotta wait, you gotta pay your dues. He's almost back to sunglasses. That's why mentality and it's going to ruin this whole fight podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       I'll do you bring this up. We'll shoot it. How agiri on top with Dennis. He re look at this, but it's not pro wrestling. It's high school wrestling that I'm talking about here because I think I'll does going to do to macgregor. What core me did the Johnson all not a wrestler on that level though. Does that Jujitsu guys a big difference between wrestling and he's going to try to knock them out. You're bat shit. You're bat shit crazy though. If you think it gets into grappling match at is not going to get taken down or out Jujitsu. I believe that all those Jujitsu is so fucking underrated. Is that goodwill class, that world class he beat Cabrina. Oh, shut the fuck up. Police guys. He's guys, I'm sorry. He's beaten. Worldclass black belts. Let's just say that in straight Jujitsu concentration. Jujitsu. He's, he's elite.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       I mean when you watch a movie, you watch his Mike Brown fight. When you fought Mike Brown for the WEC title, he takes his back like a ghost gets those hooks in and just [inaudible] you're going know when you're a kid. Second on your mom's titty. He was an ag. That's how long he's been doing. Shit. Big Difference. Accurate. But he's been doing it a while. My man, well he's explosion his, his speed with those who kicks and punches men older than me of the others. 63 years old. No, you are a motherfucker. Look at Seavers busted up cow. Caligiuri yeah, that's a great photo. You Dennis. He runs a guy where I was talking, I was doing this interview with Crooklyn Stephie from, cause she's with bloody elbows. I would you do like regular interviews with her. She's my friend. Um, but we were talking about Ken shamrock and Kimbo

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       they were, they were on this pro ped rat and they got cut off because both of them were basically like, who gives a fuck? Why don't you steroids you steroids. I'm thinking, why can't guys like make an agreement? Like if, say like, you know, if you got like Vitor Belfort and whoever and they made an agreement to be able to use whatever the fuck they wanted. And you know, you're both saying like, can canon chemos proof example 41 and 51 super suspect if, and they fought in Missouri, so did Bobby Lashley and Bobby, then Bobby Lashley always fights and these strange places with fucking soup propped up athletic commissions. Yeah, I mean, I just think that there's not nothing wrong with making an agreement like that. Well, you know what's weird to me is like, you look at other sports, like in baseball, if you get tested, if he testifies for steroids, your show fuck no hall of fame, you get booed ever. We go look at Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, right? And then sending all these records, if you get caught in the, in the UFC, you're kind of fucked. You look at a guy like Rothko who got caught or Alistair Overeem, then they fight. Everyone kind of forgets. It's whatever. You get cotton football, it's not a big deal. It's weird to me, man. It's weird how we baseball's America. It's weird though. America's not change. Damn it. And you don't need to understand in your mouth once a year looking all fucking Eurasian. Oh look at all brown brown.

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       I just think society needs to be consistent. It shouldn't matter. Right? Like if, cause baseball's a weird one man, because it's like who gives a fuck? No, you're batting the ball. Bat speed. You can keep playing and all up into your thirties and no shit. I want to see home runs. I want them jacked on steroids to the gills and crush and balls. Yeah, exactly. Like Sammy Sosa. Mcgwire how dope was that? That was the only time that people were excited. Yeah. Felt deflated. There's this weird old as well. How about Sammy Sosa turn into a white guy? What the fuck happened? Michael Jackson's super crazy. I think in the collegiate to skin or something. It's like a gray color. It's weird. It's dead. Yeah. He looks like it was like a corpse. It's just so weird how the society bring up Sam. He says that when he first went into the league and when and when he was two 40 it's the difference is ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          01:04:37       Oh Martin. When we get my was wire, he was giant. He had the fucking Paul boomer arms, thighs, forums where show Jen my thighs with a hand at the end of it. That's what I want. Like Tony, you love fucking bullshit wrestling pro lesson. You love that fake wrestling. Now think if the drug test it was like, do you have seen they're all skinny? Is it as cool now you watch pro wrestling cause are these characters they they look like superheroes. We'll see. I'm takeaway drug tests and see second, here's a bad example, Doug cm punk is one of the biggest wrestlers in the world and he's 100% clean. He's the exception. But, but there's a went through at UFC is going through back in that hall

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Cogan thing in the late mid, mid, early nineties. It was huge. And so they had to eliminate it. They had to, they have to do it themselves. They have like a super strict parole say burrow. I'm serious. Super strict. And tell me, but Tiesta and the rock are clean. No, watch your words sir. Come on. The Rock. The rocks on steroids. This is Tony. You weigh six pounds and you're talking about a guy who is an immense super app is probably about two 60 is Brock Lesnar on steroids. Of course they're all, they've all done something. They've all done. Brock Lesnar, first of all has superior genetics. There'll be the phrase structure that that guy has. You can go back to when Brock Lesnar was in high school, he was a fucking monster. He benched two 25 49 times. Yes. 49 we can see is Columbine is calm down.

Speaker 2:          01:06:10       My numbers are stupid. Combined numbers are through the roof. His vertical is insane. Polite Brock Lesnar's combine numbers. Jamie, all that said he got shitted on when we get to the NFL, they made fun of it, wasn't ready for it and he was playing football. He's been doing wrestling fruits. Brock Lesnar's the super freak, but back to bullshit wrestling. You don't think these guys cause pink color schedules to their schedule is fucking insane. Night. You're not eating protein shakes and staying on that schedule. My mandate, the Piss on your sport or your entertainment. I mean, well those guys are constantly not getting enough sleep and it's a brutal, brutal schedule. You talked to Tony who's in that business. It's brutal, man. And after, a lot of times they have to pay for themselves. You have to own rent cars and then bill the company. It's a brutal circus of shit.

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       Totally. You think triple h is a fucking called clean. You don't get a neck like I an east. I don't know what triple h is doing. I that's, that's an interesting one. I mean, he's a fucking monster. He shaped weird. What about Battista? Dude, look, Patista is the word. I don't even acknowledge that Battista was ever even in pro. He's so, he's so terrible. What are you talking about? He was great. And Guardians of the galaxy. Phenomenal. Oh, Europe mess. No. How dare you now the guardians of the galaxy disappointing to watch him talking. Shit. That movie was great. Spotlight. You're out of your mind. What's a good movie? Mad Max was great but didn't see it. I heard it was awesome. We're going to fucking love it. You know what? Too much action. You know it's dope. Dude did I didn't see until this weekend when I was flying back from Mexico.

Speaker 2:          01:07:47       John Wick, the Keanu Reeves movie, the action will be replaced. They kill his dog and he goes and kills everybody. Really? Oh Hon. They kill his dog. So he goes, no, no, no. I'm not doing it. Justice. Revenge. They kill cells. Combine numbers. It's a fucking phenomenal movie they're doing. John Wick to look at is 44 seven 40 by the way, 283 pounds. Four seven 40 35 inch vertical jump, long jump, 10 feet standing, jump, 10 feet bench press to 25 to 30 reps. Jesus fucking Christ, a running back, living in the body of a defensive end. It's ridiculous. He's an ease of free. I gotta be honest, especially when he did do that as a number of years ago. Now that's not that freakish. Yeah, really, really. But you got to think about if some fucking freaks. Now this isn't something he was training for. No, this isn't the guy that was moving towards towards being a pro fungicide to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:08:44       Brock Lesnar's is the biggest freak the UFC has ever seen, ever, ever. Hands down if Brock are dicks off right now, if Brock Lesnar had the right coach, like if he went to a mat, not saying there's anything wrong with his coaches, this is what I'm, what I'm saying is if he had the right coach the right amount of time, like if you went to a Matt Hume or a Foracia hobby and they, they engineered his career from the beginning to the time he's being introduced to the UFC to the time he's introduced to high level competition. He could have been an all time. Yes. Paul's heavyweight, the capabilities he fought a former heavyweight champion and his second professional fight, he fought Frank Mir and his second professional fight had no idea as a defend against the leg lock. He got leg locked mass. My favorite fighter of all time.

Speaker 2:          01:09:28       Great fight. Frank Mir is a bad motherfucker, but then in his third fight after that he fights heath herring beats the shit out of heath. Herring. Then he fights Randy fucking coture stops Randy coture and his fourth professional fucking fights. Yeah. But Randy couture was like stuck in a wheelchair. Does or octagon and fucking Brock Lesnar still. It doesn't matter. He's still for the foreign professional fight. Insanely impressive what he's done in his career, man. Shane in his prime. Yes. He James in his prime. He got fucked out. There's Shane rocked and after Shane had a shit where they could have stopped it, let's be easily, could've stopped it easily. Good thing they did it because he came back and one that's came back and strangle them. Look, Brock Lesnar, I mean he had no business fighting Allister after he came back from that surgery. He had no business fighting Kane.

Speaker 2:          01:10:15       He just was not on that level. But if he learned to get on that level, it's all those guys. He beats, although he has more talent than all those guys, all those guys. And, uh, but he doesn't like to get hit dude ass pat Barry when he was in his training camp and pap it, you know, they brought Pat Barry and before he fought someone, I forget in Pat, moved out there and was in Minnesota and he said he'd only train like three, two or three times a week and they were sparring and Pat, you know, pat goes hard. I was a train part of mine for years. Peck is really hard. He's a beast man. He's a beast. Stand up, terrible ground. Anyways, so he fucking hits Brock and I guess Brock freaks the fuck out. And his coaches were like, what the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 2:          01:10:55       And path like, what do you mean? Like don't fucking hit Brock in the faith. That was like, what the fuck am I doing here then? And they're like, you just Paul Man, just feel it out. What? Yeah, I'm pals. Like this is some bullshit. They weren't hitting him, but that's [inaudible] great story. Well that's weird. Him Training with Brock. I had heard conflicting stories. I had heard that that's not true. Hmm. So I'm going to have to do a fight night without you guys. I'm very sad. No Way. Next weekend. No Man. Saturday night fucking bullshit. And my boy Leo does fighting to Cindy. You don't have to be there with him. You come with me. He does. He needs. Why? What's it for without me? He gets lost and I think he does well with our dog.

Speaker 2:          01:11:38       Maybe this bet. No, no, no. That's not true. Where's Brian? I'm depressed. His head. Hags hello my boy. Leo's fighting. I was just with him last week. Tiny man. He looks great. Does he? Looks Great. Does he great. What was going on with him entering into that Rockhold fight. This is a second. Whoa. That's a tight guillotine. He had the right knee was more important than even the choke fine. 100%. Yeah. Getting that right knee up and over. It was more important. Position over submission. This are right. That's fucking great. Kenny. As a position over submission. First of all, defense. I am always safe. Leo said in that Rockhold fight, he had, um, in exchange got hit in the back of the head and he was out of sorts then sort of, he said it was in illegal shot. I completely disagree. I watched the elbow land Atlanta to the side of the head.

Speaker 2:          01:12:29       It was a ruthless was fucking elbow that Rockhold hit him with, but Rockhold had already had his back, was already beaten them up. Rockhold had them on the ground and Machita didn't look good physically. He looked different physically. He looks soft. I agree. A hundred percent rock called he's gonna fight widened, right. Rockhold is going to fight Weidman and that's a fucking motherfucker of a file. Real quick. Best fight in middleweight history. Naval battling could be maybe him, uh, Anderson versus Weidman might be the only other fighter that's old school Anderson, but Anderson, the first by Anderson is prime Anderson. The first fight versus Weidman. We didn't know that it was over and I know, but we found out really quick. Well, we only found out because he fucked up. If Anderson didn't fuck up Anderson escape from the knee. Need Bar, right escape from the leg lock attempt by Weidmann and was beating Weidman standing up before he's clowning around and trying to goad Weidman into an exchange so he could, you know, he could counter attacks and I'm standing up because he's making such a joke of kicking the shit.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       Punched him in the face. He was not punching in the face. No, it was not. Well, he barely hit him in the face. He didn't like kids through a lot of leg kicks. And it was the first thing that John Danaher said to me when I went into the corner, John Donner, her said, uh, I said, congratulations after Wyman. Beat him. Donna is such a fucking wizard. The first thing that it was mine, I don't like how many times he was getting hit with those leg kicks. He was the first thing out of his mouth. It's like the guy just won the middleweight championship of the world. Knocked out. Anderson Silva was a great coach. Exactly. Um, I just think you have two fighters in there. Very, very prime, right? Like, yeah. Rockhold had to slip up where he got his fucking, I kicked out by, by Vito juiced up Vitorin Brazil.

Speaker 2:          01:14:05       Right. Other than that, he's a mother fucker. You have Weidman is prime. You have Rockland is prime. It's rare. We see this man. Yeah. To me it's the best vitamin weight history if not one of the best fights in UFC history. I would agree. I would agree with that. I think, I think Brock, Shane's better. I think that's a bigger fight. But other than that, I think what's meager five because it's the heavyweights settles most important title Troy, but, and those are also two true heavyweights who brought some shit to the octagon. Right? Like canes to a tough sell man because he doesn't look in posing. Right. He doesn't really talk. He just wants to wrestle and fucking chill. Right? I don't think so. I think you've Cain was more active and he hadn't been injured and you just run it through the division like he was when he was in his prime before.

Speaker 2:          01:14:45       Like this two year layoff. If you look at the cane that beat up junior dos Santos and the second and third fights, if you'll get the cane that stormed through Ben Rothwell that's old school, but that cane if he had was like more active, he'd be like Canelo Alvarez. He be fucking huge. It's just tough to sell him when he's on the shelf for two months or two years rather than me. But think about when Brock Brock fucking Lesnar the WWE crowd and then he had the UFC crowds sold and he's being bitches up former champs frank. When you heat up in the air and you could tour, you know what I'm saying? It's insane. When he beat up mirror and stop destroyed, his face smashed his face. He's the biggest star of the UFC has ever had. And then you have Shane Carwyn. Remember Shane just got done beating the brakes off.

Speaker 2:          01:15:26       Mayor knocked out Gonzaga and all knockouts. Mgm Grand, biggest heavyweight, 12 time in UFC. That's the biggest fight in UFC history. Yeah, no, I just think Rockhold and Weidman is a dope, dope fight man. What was also the biggest paper view card ever is also, it was UFC 100 of course. So it was a big event and you know, it was a lot of shyness and a UFC 100 oh, that's right. I'm thinking of mirror. Yeah. You're thinking of Mayor Brock and Shane was UFC one 16 at Mgm Grand One 16 one 16 because I fought rusher on that. There's your boy pat. Yeah, there it is. We've got to have him tell us the story of training with Brock Lesnar MMA record three and two of that stuff. Um, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Brock does crazy stuff in the WWF that seems in human that other wrestlers have never been able to do.

Speaker 2:          01:16:14       Skylar asked me, sir, don't bring in Dodo events. Keep bringing it up. Is The guy there? He has 69 he's 70 that's natural. Totally natural. No one, no one has ever looked like that at 69 if you'd quit bullshit and get on TRT, that could be you. That thinks 21 years older than me. 22 years old out of them. It's insane. Richie Shit, which is shit muscular tits. Great market and love it and crazy. Ooh, look at this. Is Dick's probably hard all day long. He destroys on Mcgregor. Conor McGregor. I comb that. I come from the show. I said on, I spoke, I spoke my country's name and my native tongue. I said, ed, I'll tell you what. That's what I can't wait to hear those Irish and Brazilian chance going back and forth can be outside. She can't

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       wait to hear is the sound of head kicks from the crowd as fucking giant Broccoli. I wanted to shoot my myself like a lightning bolt through his chest. Let's you sounded Scottish while he's looking back is actually from Scott, but you're ruining the new tattoo. The tiger on his stomach fucked up when I set of apps like that and you cover it with that bullshit and it's such good work. It looks like a three d image. Look at him. Although Scarface, Scarface, bad, he's a bad motherfucker. People got to educate themselves on all though, man. I mean he's no joke and mother Fucker, he's no joke.

Speaker 1:          01:17:53       Any, any of motivation. Not that he doesn't. Anyways, but now he's talking all this shit. Like I said, I'm a Connor fan though. How can you not be man? What he's done for the story's crazy. Did you see how all those brought in the jungle fight guy? Be a [inaudible] know. How do you say the Bald Guy Bill? How would he know? No. Pull up a video. Josie Aldo brings in Jonah's bill hotard hene hole does not know how to say that. Say the dude's name, but the point is the dude who we brought in can emulate Connor perfectly. He's built like Connor and he's a beat. He does. He move like tunnel. That's the different, he's good dude. He's good. Yeah, you got to see this guy. First of all, pull up, pull up a highlight reel, pull out, pull up a highlight reel for Jonah's jungle fight champ.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Jonah's, B. I. L. H. A. R. I. N. H. O. O. I've seen this dude fight before. He's a bad motherfucker. He fights one 45 and he fights the same style that Connor does. A fuck isn't any in the UFC. He will be eventually. He's a beast. I mean, he's got a, he's got a contract with jungle fight. He's was champ. You know, it's a big Brazilian organization's trouble for Connor though. If he found someone to mimic that style. Well that's the issue with Connor. Watch this cat. This cat's good dude. Look at Bill Marino. This is him because his, they call them speed, but watch how this guy moves around. He moves around exactly the Connor and he fights southpaw. Watch how this mother fucker fights. Look at this. He looks just like, oh, he's, she's wicked. He's wicked dude. He's wicked tail. He's got nasty kicks. He's a real good striker and he's got a vicious look at that.

Speaker 1:          01:19:31       Look at that fucking switch. Kick to the head, Dude. He's built just like Connor. You exactly. He moves like Connor to look at this motherfucker. Ooh, he's good. His kicks are better than Connor's. How about that? He hurts dudes too, man. He's good. Damn Bill. If Reno's no joke man, strictly please stand up, huh? No, he's, he's an MMA champ. He's nasty dude. Look at him. He's no joke. Okay, so this is the guy moves. Exactly. This is the guy that Connor's bringing it and a lot of local cobra. Look at the, I know is better than Connor. A lot of people think that he could beat Conor in an MMA fight. Fucking looks good, man.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Man. Look at this fucking movement. He's no joke. That's straight left. Does he have any losses? Ah, I don't know man. I know what his record is cause I mean obviously it's a highlight. So yeah, he's a bad motherfucker, but well, you know, look, he's, he moves just like him. He looks exactly like him. There couldn't be a better trainer, but he's nasty. I wonder how he's lost. He's even wearing his hair like Connor and preparation for this fight. Damn all in. Yeah. Watch this. Okay, now pull up a video of a Aldo training with them. Watch this. He also, he painted his face all the way. Look how he's doing his hair. He's got his fucking hair up like Connor lowly shit son. And he's just like, exactly. He's doing all the shit that Connor does. He brought, he brought him in to mimic Connor.

Speaker 3:          01:20:45       Dude on put my entire life savings. See how he's doing now. Yes, this is a game changer. It's kid fish die. Fuck man. He's just like, exactly. And he's, you know, he's got that style of movement in the first place. All the three 60 wheel kicks and roundhouse kicks and all that shit too. That's trouble. It's interesting. It's very interesting. Very interesting. What is that guy's name again? Bill [inaudible]. Bill arena. I'll see promise. He's from Brazil. Sage A. I. N. H. O. M. Have a new boyfriend. Guys Know Joe. He's no joke. I like [inaudible]. He said better kicker than Conor. Better than he must like it. See, Connor's kicks her almost disdainful. If you watch the way Conor throws his kicks, he throws his kicks a lot the way like exactly like bitch, I'll just throw these kicks out there. So He's six and no, he hasn't lost every wind's been by Tko.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       He's got one decision. Dan, once a mission, we're in naked choke. He's a bad motherfucker. Holy Fuck Man. Where does he fight? What fights you? The junk of five champion. He's No, 25 five 11 five 11 one 45 and Connor Connor's not five 11 five not five 11 see is I'm five 11 Connor's not close to five 11 you. Dot. You're known. When we find out that you're wrong, it's going to be ugly. Take a look at the Instagram picture with us. How much time you, you go Instagram. He's slouching. I stood next to him and I know, you know I look at body. You have boots on. I'm obsessed with it, right? You're right. Thank you. He's five. Nine. Everybody be quiet. Is He? Yes. Yes. Everybody. Give it up. Give it up. Kevin. Come on, man. I'm trying to be death. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Jesus man.

Speaker 3:          01:22:30       Connors. Five eight says it says they're five eight. Well, I'm five eight and honestly I think he's an inch taller than me. I think that's not correct. It's tough. It's tough, man. That's insane. I don't know. I'm more surprised that he brought in that guy or calendar. I feel of Reno Bill of Reno is a fucking real game changer. That's a game changer. Yeah. Big Game Changer because he's going to learn how to deal with that style. And Bill arena was explaining to him all the different setups that he does. Because bill, you fights exactly like Connor fights. He sets up kicks and punches in a very, very similar way. And that's huge man. Because when you fight someone

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       like Connor there, there's very few fighters, there's Connor, Leo Machida, Ronda Rousey, Stephan struve. Cause he's fucking nine foot tall. There's certain guys we get one shot at. You can't duplicate it. Right, right. So now you find a guide just like Connor or maybe you're going to see that dude, that's a fucking game change. Exactly. Exactly. Damn. And I'm putting a lot of money on Giardia. I'm rooting for Connor though. My heart wants Connor, but my brains, I don't be, I love Josie. I love Connor too. I have no, I have no dog in this fight. I really do mean I just want a great fight. I went to live up to the height, Dana said he thinks would be the biggest paper view ever. It could be. It's not going to be bearing UFC 100 so let's get real. It could be either one of these days are bigger stars than Brock.

Speaker 2:          01:23:46       Oh. But internationally, they certainly are. Conor McGregor is the biggest star in combat sports history to come out of Ireland. Wow. Well, really? There's a lot man co Madeline traditional bra on boxer edition. Yeah, but they've Wayne McCullough, your boy. Wayne McCullough comes from Wayne McCullough. There's Dev a lot of great boxes that have come from Ireland. Look at this daily superstars back for over 1 million paperclips, so not the biggest average says on track for 1 million. I misquoted Dana. Oh, fucking rip. My Connor thinks it's going to be the biggest ever, not Dana. Okay. My bad. Connor or Dana, this takes over a million. Look at that site. It does over a million, so sure it does over a million. 100% yeah, I think it does a million watch. I think internationally in Europe especially, I think we really have no idea how big he is. What is the date? It said July 11th find the kid won't be at the UFC expo.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       It's all the shit going on. What is that about? How come you guys won't be in the UFC? Actually we can't talk shit about Reebok and show up at the X. Is that what's going on? I'm just saying I'm, I'm assuming that it has a little bit to go on it, but do they see the shit going on? Shit going on. Listen, if we ever want to do it, well we could do is next time there's a UFC where you guys want to do something. We could just get a studio somewhere like it, uh, at a casino and do a live event and have a podcast with a three of us. We just go onstage live. So we'll do the way in and then after the way, and we'll do like a 6:00 PM podcast somewhere and the only few, and I do an 8:00 PM show somewhere at 9:00 PM show. Dude, really? And Tony Hinchcliffe, Tom [inaudible] and I will be at the car theater at MGM where they do Cirque de Solei. That's a great show laying in the show.

Speaker 2:          01:25:23       I just remembered. You're reminding me I have to act to figure out, maybe I should email. It's someone who like knows more, but they told us last time at that car theater cause it's a Cirque de Solei theater that we can do like crazy stuff. What do you mean come in like on a zip line or they're not coming in. I was too much to your fucking trying to be a tour for comedy now. It's like, no, you can't do that. You can just go out there and you do get sick. A zip line. But it has a nice suit on like the Golden Pony and saying, do I get to do something like that instead of your own show? Show some sensor and you don't. You want to come in from the bottom like brides a hi

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Todd. Cigarette guy died at that Cirque de Solei theater. Dying. Dying. Dying is a combination. Wrestling. Think about who's the guy who fell fucking Brett. The hitman Hart's brother. Do you want to be Brett? The hitman Hart's brother? Here's girl Jessica Benet. I gotta take a leak before this gets going. She looks calm, man. For sure. Don't duck lip it though to lock the gun. She's sexy, Bro. Yeah. Don't hate on sexy. I'm not hating on see yourself. Don't hate it. I just said the winner of this gets a nose job. Frenos job. Dammit. Brendan, what's wrong with that? But let me tell you something about Yohanna. Me and Tony got a couple beaks ourselves. Yeah. Wait a Salem throw me under the bus.

Speaker 3:          01:26:45       This big bomb, Bro. We're part of the beat. Clam guys might know this is probably smaller than well, my nose is right there with you guys. Huh? Johann has a is the only one that doesn't have the weird knows. [inaudible] knows I'm waiting for it to get messed up. [inaudible] no, right. I'm with you on Johana and on. I like, I like these. Both these girls are attractive to me. I don't care what anybody says. You're such a pussy. Yeah. You still worried about people lashing out on dude, we, my air BNB did said they're unable to accommodate my request. Hey, let's do this offline. Kellan sorry, but for 100% don't text her in the shot. Hurts me.

Speaker 4:          01:27:22       I mean, she's got a wrestler. That's her only chance. Did you see it just jumped to the yard? Do you follow you on, on Instagram? Oh, I don't. Oh my God. You should look up this thing of her striking the other day we watched it. Oh my God. Fucking animal. An animal. The one where she's hitting the Mitts and then sprawl.

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       What up? What up? Pop Up. Pop Up. [inaudible] she's a fucking monster. She's the best women's striker to ever grace the UFC. Is She gonna win this fight then in your mind? Oh, you're talking about the the fucking minus 700 favorite? Yes, Brian. I'd think so. Well just get a penny. I mean, it's gonna be a tough go for her because she fucked a Carlos Esparza. Fucking Joanna did and just dismantled Esparza. So Penn eight her only chit chance, not striking. She's going to have to get him to the ground. Yeah. It's not wrestlings Jujitsu and

Speaker 4:          01:28:11       all of you on his fights ago, because I've been to quite a few of them. Just luckily, you know, matched up with the gigs that I do with Joe. And she just happens to be on the card and two fights ago, uh, she went all Jujitsu against the Jujitsu girl and rolled with our man and her specialty is striking and sh she just g out Jujitsu, the Jujitsu Carlos Spo Spars,

Speaker 3:          01:28:32       Esparza tried taking her announce something like 16 times as successful like once or twice. If that, and a spark I would assume is a better wrestler in Penn a so she has her hands full. I, if I'm predicting this, I think Jay Jay knocks her out in the third round. All right, take [inaudible] not knockout. Tko is in third. I don't like seeing a girl who's this good at striking. Just beat up some other girl on the fake Cyborg. Gina Carano. You ever seen it looked like bully beat down. I was like, oh my God. And Carano was a sexy

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       beast. Beautiful. Oof, oof. Sign me the fuck up. She's in the audience. I'm too loud asked for it, but I'll make a go at it your way. You're just not her style. Doesn't matter bro. She was dating superman. Who's superman? Oh, that guy. Can Superman fight though? No, it's just a sexy bitch, you know? That was not good enough. You can't. If you can't fight, you can't fuck that girl the term maybe, but I don't. I just don't see anything she needs to fight around. She's a Weidman or some fucking Luke Rockhold, Brendan Schaub type character side it. That was a pro football player, right? Yeah. Calculus quarter. She's too hot and she's a Badass fighter. Like she's not going to be able to deal with some guy who can't fight and just look squishy. Walk around. I would have. How much do you worry about? She's not a little girl.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       I say. Well, when I saw her, she was she. Yes. She's easily bought at one 45 yeah, she's, she's won 60 when I saw that she's hot. No, guys, you think the girls need to be skinny? You're crazy. I don't lose my band. And number nine I agree guys. Dude, she's just all woman's Janet chronic to me is the sexiest female fighter ever. You want to make some gladiator babies? That's your fucking girl. 100% no doubt. I mean for real man. When she fought, Cyborg Cyborg was at her juicy juice. That hurt my feelings. That was a hurt feelings. I feel like guys should have jumped in there, defended her well. It would be a guy fighting. I feel like Roger worked does, should have jumped in then and defended a girl. That's fucked up, man. That was fucked. Such a fucking beat down Dave. They almost are responsible for the lack of drug testing they did for her.

Speaker 2:          01:30:36       They just didn't give a fuck. What was that like, man? I think Cyborg might be choosing a nice house and her eyes are intense. Look in her eyes, look at her, say turning. I think I agree. She take that back. Only her and Rhonda are the only two that I've been in. Atlanta has a good nose flattened. You know what JJ though looks better without makeup. I think it's when she puts makeup on. Where's that? God Damn Polo top is where it gets trouble. She's such a, in her country, in Poland, Polo tops, herb that's hot. It's like bold knapsack people and the renaissance days and were like back then, that was good to be Rubin. Ask. It was sexy. Catch you who pray, protect it from disease. Nobody had any food trailer like yoga pants in La. That's right. First Polish UFC champion, first female European UFC champion.

Speaker 2:          01:31:23       She is, this is what it should say under her title. Bad ass bitch. Six time world Moitai champion it 100% legit. You watch her Moitai it's so crisp. First of all, her fucking jab is a laser beam and it's so fast and so technical and she has confidence. She's cool. She's so gangster. What's she doing here? That video of her lighting up the pads. Jesus Christ. That's impressive. I haven't seen it. You haven't seen it. Jamie, pull that video up. The video of her from the UFC Instagram page just to get a feel for the fucking hand speed. This chick possess for the UFC. They need her to be a dominant to make this

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       uh, was it strawweight to make the strawweight division [inaudible] siding and heard it just dominate bitches like Rhonda is. Cause if you have the belt constantly switching, it's hard for people to jump on board. You know what I'm saying? I agree. I agree. I think people will catch on like her fists. I like Ron does armbar you know like she sort of has this fun thing to watch. It's all of our striking. It's not just our Fiserv elbows are nasty. Boils up bitches and clinch. No, look at that. Look up at that screen. Watch this calendar is your worst nightmares. Damn fucking dude. And I'd watch your spa. Light it up. Light it up. Light it up. Sprite. Light it up. Light it up. Light it up.

If I ever make fun of somebody too bad and they get in my face, it was like, it's speed. Camera, speed it or no it isn't. Look at the guy was totally normal. Sick. Look at the guy's movement.

Oh, she goes below scan in the pocket though. Left took is standing right there and yeah, but do you understand what's standing in the pocket means you have to exchange like these aren't exchanges. She's getting tickling. [inaudible]

Come on Jessica, don't worry. And by the way, you know, you got to think that this is fucking wearing on. We've making her fight. That kind of grueling grappling, extreme exchanges is going to wear on you ana. Yup. And she's going to slow down. Yup. Mm.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Oh Jessica would have right hand look at us. Very nice. Look at that. Great timing. Great timing on that shot. She's the real deal man, which she's forcing her to wrestle and once she forces at a wrestle it you want Ooh, nice nasty elbow on the claim. That's the one that popped in as she is right. Get inside man. That was a nice writing on the outside. She has Minjan it man. She's mean. Well you know how hard life is in Poland. The field look like that. Yup.

Tanya, let's see if Jessica [inaudible] does anyone different? Damn judging is sitting on a shelf. She's strong like these one punches one and one two and you just can't do that. What y'all want. She's just so ready to be there. Right when that second punch gets pulled back. Well especially if you're looking for a take down, you've got to throw them all in one shot. Then you shoot. Especially if she doesn't anticipate a third or fourth punch comment, like no change of angles. No opera cuts. Yup. So she's looking for the one. If she throws the one, the two's coming behind it and that's about it and she knows she's going to be right there pulling back and then countering instantly when that punch pulls back, Jj is too high level to get caught with that bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       He'll look at this and that riding desktop on. There you go. Just hold the gap though. This with the clench here, man.

Speaker 3:          01:46:56       I'm going to be here now because it's a female. Will they stop it early and then if it was a male for it. It depends on a lot of experience with this email fighting. We're in Germany, right? Oh my God. That's a huge gash. And you do it. Most man. Well, they put adrenaline on it and they could try to close it up. They close it up with Vaseline. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Oh fuck that. It's, I think it was an elbow that lit her up elbow. That was him right there. Immediately. The blood SLOs. Jj. He's my favorite fighter now. Hey Tony. I'm on board. I don't want to fuck her, but she's my favorite. She's my favorite fight and fucking in man. This bitch is bad. Hey, real quick. I never watched her fine. I gotta be honest. I don't watch a lot of girl fight Ronda fight. Somebody in that way class with this kind of striking would be very interesting on that side, but not really in fucking tosser 20 feet. There's some nose dad. Her nose was just totally smashed. What a bad ass. You've got to give it up, man. Oh, Jessica Bernays. No joke. Jasmine Benet. No, you don't get to this level without fucking being tough. Come on, man. This is different. This is more than tough. This is transcended the well, this is fucking no easy.

Sledgehammers the hands out, but she doesn't have this kind of technique. No. Ouch. Keep your hands up please. I've never seen a little hundred 15 pound female fighter fucked the girl up like this in my entire life. So good Cyborg doesn't do this to girls. She had that. She had fucking sledge hammers the hands out, but she doesn't have this kind of technique. No. Wow. Look at the wealth above and below her. I don't let her get Jesus Christ next for Jay Jay. No, it's want to sign up for it took a day to day and her had a really close fight.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       She wanted to split decisions. Yeah. You're talking about the 2.0 Jay Jay. Yeah. Well she's a different Jj. No, she's got it. She's got the another elbow for sure. Finish this round some right though. Jj, what are you talking about? What? It froze. Oh, we'll reboot it, man. Reboot. It just rebooted. Rebooted bull shit. God. Can they hear the recording? It's still live. Right? Recording Jessica [inaudible] contact. She's amazing. She's, she's tired. I'm looking at when she keeps moving, man. Fuck Dude. She is definitely tough as fuck. She's so tough. She just doesn't have an answer to this now. Who does look at the swelling all over face? Not that I still moving her head still. Pinay is definitely game. God is, she had her hands up. Tam. Hands up. God, I'm stressed out. Low left. Took why he's stressed out. I like to see girls get fucked.

Speaker 3:          01:50:06       Oh really? I don't, I don't hate them exactly. To Brendon. I don't either. I Hate Austin. I'm exhausted. I cringed. I don't feel, I feel sick aunt and my hands feel numb. Jj is a fucking nightmare machine. She hasn't been touched. It's just no good. She's no joke. That's for sure, man. Her technique is so beautiful. I want to see her go to the body. I like how she switches up to southpaw orthodox. Either. That Jab is ridiculous. God Damn. Ouch. Oh, Jessica pinay with the clinch. You want to get a little careless there. Jessica trying to drag her to the ground, could drag him to the ground. Look at this part to get her down and knock her nose off of her to get her down on the knee. Oh, it's squirting out of that girl's face. Is that a hell of a fight? Fuck yeah, it is, man.

Speaker 3:          01:51:02       I think it's interesting that the UFC as male centric as it has been for so long is a leader in feminist, like a feminist activity, like a leader in women's fighting and it's, and it's as exciting as men's, right? Well, there's no women's boxing of any prominence right now. You don't know of any women's champions. Nobody talks about in the other leaks. There's just not, well, there's Invicta, right? They're all female. But to this boxing, I mean there's only, there's only a lion fight that has women's Moyie Thai fights, time bomb. She's that shoot. I just watched the other day I was sewing president to tweet it out. I was like, God damn, tiff, time bumped that beast. She's a beast. Get a girl like that. The traffic to son. Get a girl to learn how to sprawl. Right. Enjoy that. Well, young JJ on your hands that he's there you go.

Speaker 3:          01:51:50       Well she's at that same level if not higher. Yeah, she's a Maltese and measuring shot and Tiffany could go do some modeling she wanted to to, you know what I'm say up. That's when you get a superstar. Now that JJ can be a superstar. Hobos man, those elbows in tight. Jj, go ahead and finish her for me, girl. Hey Brendan. When is that way? What does the doctor do? Their stuff it, they uh, how much they can put things in them in it, but like up it. But then in the back they set, they set your notes. I've had my nose set twice. I said, Ooh, your Adrenaline Jab. That's Tareq and right hand. Now I'll call it, nailed it and fight. It was crazy. She's a beast. She is a fucking beast. Slugger. Airy. Look at that blood on that. No one wants a piece of that son. Who's next?

Speaker 2:          01:52:47       Who's next? Yeah. What did she look to the car, Tony, you get fucked up tonight. I love it. To fucking Badass. She's so cool. God, she's a police man. Mad Respect for Jessica. Danny's a fan favorite. Now you cannot be a fantasy show. Tough. Oh look at her fucking nose, dude. Look at her nose. Oh my God. Oh my God. That knows. Now when you get a gash like that, that opens up easier the next time. Right? Scar tissue. Yeah, on the nose. It's not too bad. It's on the ice where you're in trouble. They're going to repair it. They'll do a great job. Did you see? Um, uh, Dave, who the fuck showed? Uh, oh, um, uh, Raquel Pennington brew cal paint and had a big gash on her forehead and then show me pictures of it before and after like the job that they did like repairing it.

Speaker 2:          01:53:41       They did an amazing job. Like you can't even see the scar. I don't know how the fuck they did it. I mean they have like really good plastic surgeons these days. Scar tissues. A mother Fucker, man. Yeah it did. And people scar differently. Like black people, they tend to get more keloid scars there for some reason. Their scars like they, they have like thicker wealth type co scars. A stickup higher. Mm. Depends on the person. It depends on it's side of, it's genetic. I had a nose job after I fought cro cop and he shattered my nose with an elbow Chan. I was worried. I was like, God, am I me fucked from now? And the doctor's like, no, your nose probably won't ever break again. Because what? The way they structure it, they, they're so advanced now it's stronger. Wow. Stronger after you break it.

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       How do they do? What are they doing? I'm not sure. Because he threw an APP. What? Like shattered my nose into pieces, right? We put like a mesh net and it almost, oh, face isn't touched. Look at her fucking face. Look at Jessica's face. Kind of feel bad dude. How about, what's she gonna look like in the six hours? That's awful man. Look at this fucking monster. Not touched. Not touched. Does she's a bad ass. Get somebody that far ahead of you and striking. What are you gonna do? I mean she's so try and take them down cause she's far ahead of her and grappling. But now it's just pay off. Yeah. Not just far ahead and striking, but takedown defense as well. Unbelievable. Take out these ads or take down defense is nasty. Finable balance. Dan Hardee rocking the fucking converse all stars. She's totally about the take. It's Mike from him. If he could, if he left, the other ones have its current crank this up so we can hear this

Speaker 7:          01:55:17       and again and again and again from me. These five we'll do the one.

Speaker 2:          01:55:31       Not really. It's more of a beat. Well, it's a kind of war like when the UFC has a world like this. It's sort of like when the United States invades Afghanistan. Yeah. It's kind of a war I guess, where we're just like, we got God. Come on. Give me a shout out. Could you imagine my number one fan, Tony Hinchcliffe Golden Pony, golden pony on the topic. I had an idea to success and victory. I think she said it. It's our belt. This get to the face kid. Ooh, that's no fun. Oh yeah. Jay Jay's my favorite fun. Her angles are amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:27       Dammit. Mark are God damn. She's good. I agree with you. A big brown. This is so important for this division to have a dominant champ like that to really make everybody excited about it. It seems to think if there was no Rhonda at one 35 what do we do? What are you doing? What's going to change nonstop? Yeah. There's nothing. There's no, that's a problem with Rhonda at that weight class. That was it. Less Cyborg and get down to one 35 who do you anticipate to see? Even a channel. Rhonda is a different story because she's such a dominant champion. She's just destroying it now. It's like, all right, this isn't cool. Like she's like, she's moved past that 0.41 15 we need it. But around has already gone past that point where we have to have some sort of competition. Cause like I bet when she fights in Brazil, I bet the numbers aren't great concern.

Speaker 2:          01:57:17       She's destroying bitches. You get the Mike Tyson effect where you're too good. Where it's like hold up. I'm not going to spend $70 a c or merge some girl in 15 seconds. Right. Cause the comp tickets then, not that she's not fighting good fighters, but people assume that they're not good and Ron has just been spoonfed, which is not true. Oh look at that fucking elbow. Do you think batchko HIA has a chance at she not. She has nothing. Oh really? Batch and your talk shit about Rhonda is deck commit suicide. You fucked up so good. Yeah. Well she said she doesn't commit suicide after the fight. She didn't apparently said she didn't know that her dad's suicide. You know, believe, believer, no, I don't believe her. She may not. I think she got too much heat and then she was like, oh that's gross. But you give Rhonda reason to break your motherfucking arm cause her dad what?

Speaker 2:          01:58:05       Dude? She's in trouble and, but the UFC is doing everything they can to black. All right. This one's going to be close. We're centered to Brazil to fight in the home country of batch. Now come on. Wow. It's too much man. But it's not Rhonda his fault, but the public views it as, oh they're just tossing anyone to Rhonda. But that's what's the best available. It's not. Rhonda is fall. There's your girl Toni, look at her. Keeping my eye on these coaches are hers. I got a little touchy. Your fucking hands up high girl. She's so good. Does she have a nickname? No, they need to make one for you. Refer to as j j j j is a good name for him and I like change market that man. Yeah, no, I liked Jay Jay, I think. I think you nailed it. The other one, the jerk or a Dick?

Speaker 2:          01:58:52       I don't think we should use that. I just didn't know what to say. I took some heat press with her, man. He too fucking technique is so spectacular. Scary little thing. She's so good, dude. I've never seen a female fighter just destroy, grow and break her down and do that damage better than Cyborg. Way Better. Way Better. Way More. Way more skillful and not just overwhelmingly physically dominant. It's all technique because yes, girls with submissions, but she's not like cutting and breaking them down. Destroying this girl cologic a Dahlia and her had a very close fight. This, this is the next one in line because Claude, you could Dahlia, they went to a fucking split decision. They went to war. Man. A good day. It took her down like a day is now. Joe, Tim's good day is pretty. And by the way, I thought day you'll won the fight.

Speaker 2:          01:59:40       Wow. I fucked. Could tell you one. The decision, I thought it was very close. She's gonna fuck with Dell. You're wanting to resign. Yeah. 12 and one and that one is to Yolana. Wow. The one and the one was a very fucking close fight to JJ. Now they fight, I want to say a year and a half ago. You're dealing with a confident JJ, right? Yeah. It was before her, her title fight with, um, it was to set up the, the title fight with Esparza. She, Michelle Waterson in their division now though. She's, she's not, she's in the UFC now. Oh really? The broader signed with UFC. Yeah. She's fighting similarly. She looks heavily Musk muscled. I wonder if some of that is help get diarrhea. Yeah, she might test positive. Well Michelle Waterson they'll beat, uh, submitted Jessica Penne a shallow water sense of peace. Yeah. She has a beast.

Speaker 2:          02:00:32       She's very Jackson's. Yeah. You won't talk about someone who for sure stopped doing that. You want to talk about someone who's super marketable, Michelle Waterson cause she's really pretty too. It's true. Well, they need that man and they need to make sure that she's ready because she won't be pretty after Chavon answers. Right. Girl tend to unpretty if on you, she goes, look at her. Who's next? Who's next? Next. Next. Next. Geez. She's only 27 two men. She has what they need now. When, when she, what did she study? Just strict more time cause it looks like boxing six time world champion. She's definitely got great hands. Well Shit. Holland Dutch came white tie is, you know, more ties boxing as well. Like there's a lot of Moitai Thai fighters like yachts and climbs up fucking Badass boxer. I mean Moitai is not mean that they don't have good hands.

Speaker 2:          02:01:20       Especially today in this day and age before guys like Ramon Decker came over to Holland. A lot of those guys didn't concentrate in their hands as much. But once the European guys and once some of the uh, American guys started going over to Holland or to Thailand and fighting you, you started to see a lot more hand techniques from the ties, the or the motherfucker because people are really good with the elbows man. Somebody like her star, like what she does or look at Cro cop, Conor Mcgregor, 2008 Oh, crank that up. Oh well he handles, it's all over his face in 2000 looking sharp. He really stepped his game up. You got a big head, Huh? All right. Yes, it does. Noggin. I'm the future. That's when he was like 16 damn man.

Speaker 2:          02:02:13       He was about to retire two years ago. Yeah, about to retire. He had a friend, apparently his friend had got so battered up in a fight that they told him never fight him. Fight again. Yeah. It was really worried, like thinking about his life going, fuck, what am I doing? It was out of the gym is coach called him. Doc offered him a fight. He didn't answer the phone. He told a story on a podcast. He didn't answer the phone over and over again. Finally it was like, Oh fuck it. I'll pick it up. How crazy. The Anderson Silva, same thing, basically was going to walk away and know. Kara was like, no man, this, let's just see what happens. Keep going. They get signed by the UFC and does fuck Chris Liebing. He was retired and no guarantee. That's why he owes his career that he says that he goes, I owe everything to Nogueira because big nog was like, no man.

Speaker 2:          02:02:52       Just keep going for a little bit. Let's see what happens. And he talked him into it. What does and do now? I mean he's in this weird predicament too with the drug testing where they uh, apparently they found like he had to two samples and one of them tested positive and the other one from a different lab did not test positive. So this is dispute as to which one was correct. That's the thing that bothers me is he just denies it. Like he should just come on back. Listen, my leg was fucked up. I used some stuff to get my leg better. He said that I don't think he did. He's well, from what I've hear he's denied any bit of it. Really. Yeah. Cause he went on the ultimate fighter and he was like, I've never taken steroids is bullshit. It's all a scam.

Speaker 2:          02:03:33       I thought he said Anders, I thought they said Anderson admitted to taking something to heal his leg but it was out of competition. And then once he, because he tested positive more than once, you know, tested positive before the, before the fight in camp. And then he tested positive again after the fight. But said negative after the first positive. I'm always fascinated with those, those moments in your life where one person says one thing to you, when it changes the course of your life, what do you mean? You know what I mean? Like when somebody goes, okay, don't, don't quit. Keep going. Maybe one more. And you think of those times that were seminal in your mind and your life will be that one person, one teacher, one guy who says one productive thing or one negative thing. Well, I stopped competing. I stopped fighting and I focus 100% on comedy because this one kid at an open mic night said to me that I was really good when I first started, but I've drifted off.

Speaker 2:          02:04:25       Oh, I was like, fuck, he's right. I really was right. I didn't even get upset. I was like, he's right. It was like six months in. It stung. It's fucking, it's so important though. It's so important to hear that Joe sit with it. I'll tell him, Brian, um, the talk we had right about not fighting anymore and how I need to move on, but we were talking, I was talking to Nate, more carts, head coach and um, I sent him what Nate tweeted out, how he made all the excuses and they tweeted back and he, yeah, he, he wasn't feeling it. He was sick. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. I get that. I get that. It's time to move on man. You have got to tell him it's your guys' duties to move on and then hit me. I'm like, this is why fucking Joe was so honest with me because if you kind of skimp around it and you, and you leave the, you know, like you kind of leave an open door worried about their feelings.

Speaker 2:          02:05:16       I can come with a million excuses why it can be world champ. You know what I'm saying? But you have the fuck it's going to hurt. Like a mother fucking might ruin your career, but you just fucking hit him. Right straight man. He got to be dead honest because even his coach is like, no, he can figure this out. I'm like, no, no, no motherfucker, it's over. You have got to tell them it's time to move on. Like yeah, but he might do this for what? So the UFC gives them these young lines and they make a name off of them for white man. He has heat. There's just, there's things we're seeing where it's not good. Yeah. There's a certain point in time where your time's past you and you've got to understand when the time is. And the only way to understand when their time is is you have to be objective with yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:05:56       You have to be honest with yourself and you need someone to tell you you can't be objective and honest with stuff. Cause you don't get to an elite level fighting being objective. You don't because you know, do I still believe I can be a champion? Yeah, I do. No, you know, no matter what, especially now, like what if our Lawsky beats for doom. And then you look at our Lawsky and your fight, which was you could have easily won that fight. I definitely beat them. But you know, look at that and you go, well how can be champ? Yeah, yeah. Which, which is great. But to me it's like, um, when, when I never, it never hit me till till I was talking to Nate and I was like, oh my God, this is what Joe did with me. Like you, you have to be so fucking honest and you can't tiptoe around their feelings because they're not going to get it.

Speaker 2:          02:06:34       It's really weird. Like sometimes you'll see like I was the first time I appreciate it, but that literally last week was the first time I ever was like, oh my God, I get it. Cause fighters, you don't get to that level without this crazy confidence man. And people tell you stuff and sometimes not good. You have to block that out and just keep going. What's also different than anything else? Like if you were a musician, no one would ever talk to you like that. But the difference between being a musician, making bad songs and being a fighter and getting punched in the face is that you're going to suffer for the rest of your life with any unnecessary damage that you take. And the more you can stop that, the more you can have a great rest of your life. You know what a friend told me that though when I was, we were arguing about Nate.

Speaker 2:          02:07:12       I'm like, Bro, I'll fucking talk to them. Right? Cause me and Nate are very close and I was like, I'll talk to him. But he goes, all right. He goes to different stream. Joe Talking to you and you talking to Nate is you have other options. I don't have to ever fight again. I'm fucking fine, man. My life's actually better now. I'm not fighting so much way better. Nay. What's Nate going to do? It's true or any father not on the article. I'm just saying I started fighters. I don't know coach. Yeah, it's hard. It's hard when most guys don't prepare for your kids. They also don't have that kind of personality that you have. That translates really easily into podcasting and fucking around and being in fucking around whether you're doing, you guys are having fun and getting paid fucking around around. Yeah, yeah. You're fucking around and cracking jokes and you know that's, it's entertaining.

Speaker 2:          02:07:57       And he's not that guy. He was done there attain, but the guy was talking to him. I can say his name, but he just goes, he goes, that's easy for you to say because you can walk away and you're gonna make more money not fighting. So you're like, yeah, see everything's great and dandy. These other fighters, they don't have that man to fall back to there. There's no 401k. There's no retirement plan. Right. Nate has four kids, a wife of mortgage bills. Fighting's his number one source of income. You see him and then at least he's not getting like stunned with every shot that lands like gray Maynard, gray, Maine or bugs me. You know, I really liked that guy. He's a great man. He's a good dude and a great fighter. And it came that close to winning the world title and now you see him and he gets lit up when you see like his body just starts short circuit.

Speaker 2:          02:08:37       Heartbreaking man. It's hard. What if Reebok did this to help fighters out? What, this is a little off this and what if Reebok said all right to help fighters out because you only get paid when you fight, right? So guys are hustling trying to figure things out. What if an awfully Reebok has the money and obviously the UFC has the money because they're drug testing every fucking fighter a million times, which is expensive. What if Reebok did a monthly payment system where you're not forced to take fights where you're not getting injured and showing up for fights? What if he did a monthly plan? It's not, they don't have enough money. There's not enough money invested in this. You think about the $70 million that Reebok put in over six years, which is nothing. Yeah, it's not much, but you got 600 fighters or something. I'm an OFAC 70 million to rebus nothing but to, to give people enough money to live comfortably.

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       I didn't say comfortably, I'm just saying it helps out because the fighters are losing tons a month. He's right. Yeah. So you make that up and they're not, you're not, you know, risking fighting, injured stuff like that. Brain trauma they get, they're getting monthly. So that makes sense. Maybe. But you know, the real problem is securing a future outside of fighting and what a guy like you, you have more potential outside of fighting now than anybody and more than you've ever had before. And as your podcast, your podcast is fucking giant right now and it's growing at this crazy rate where you guys are millions and millions of downloads every month. It's going to keep going and going and going and going and going. And it's just getting stratospheric.

Speaker 2:          02:09:59       They don't have that. They don't, and you have like all this thing, you have something to work for, like you see, you see like progress and excitement. It's like you're making a smooth transition. These guys, they don't have that. And when they don't have that, there's literally nothing. Talk to your boy Shane. You know what his car wouldn't doing. He's working as an engineer that has just not the same as being the fucking heavyweight champ of the UFC has not the same of the glory when he smashed Frank Mir, you know when he smashed Frank Mir and got ahold of him, tied him up in that clinch. It just ripping those fucking uppercuts mean that is go

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       Lori. Just Gloria on the highest level excitement on the highest level and when that ends and also you're getting a paycheck and the government gets a big piece of that paycheck. I paychecks. Not much anyway. No. Yeah, like I, I, it's depressing to talk about, it was just true for fighters. Most, you know, to my references, all dogs don't go to heaven fighting. It's not like the movies, man. This ain't no mark Wahlberg movie where the credits roll and he's walked off then sunset with a bag full of money and it's usually not like that man. You know? And we all know guys that when we talk to them, we see that diminishing things. We see their eyes not focusing right. We see their gate. One of the things that bothered me about watching Nate fight was how closest stance was. There's something that happens when, when fighters get hit a lot with their legs, they start moving their stance closer and closer together and it's just like they don't have that wide like, you know, see how, you know, Connor fights and he's getting this wide stance.

Speaker 1:          02:11:28       I fled up sneezing. When, when guys get hit a lot, they start moving their legs closer and closer together and it's almost like they, their balances fuck their motor skills are affected. You know, it's one of the things that I talked to a guy Medsker is working with this company in Dallas that um, uh, rehabilitates people from traumatic brain injuries and it's one of the things that they talked about is the gate. Like you could see the differences in the way people stand and the way they move and the way they, they move inside the ring. This is, there's a, Ben and I were talking about whether or not, and it's a very tricky thing to pull off, whether there should be some kind of an expert body, a governing body of experts who can look at somebody in their fight and say, you just can't fight anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       You lose your life. Okay, but you say that, but how do you, how do you stop our Lawsky from fighting [inaudible] because there were [inaudible] was on the way out. I'll ask. He gets starched by Fader, right? Starch flatline. He gets a starched by a surgeon or surrogate Keratan off, kicked starches up for us. You can get us the big foot, beat the fuck out of them by rumble, rumble, smashes him in the first round, breaks his jaw and you're looking at him, you're like, this guy has got to stop. Now he comes back to the UFC, wins a couple of fights, knocks out Travis Brown and he's next in line for a fact. We say, I would say the answer to that is that's a hard case. And to understand that this exception, hard cases don't make good laws. And, and I, and I hear you. It's an outlier.

Speaker 1:          02:12:51       It's an outlier. And I think if you'd have to weigh the overall sort of benefit to to con to that. So, so I do think that, I do think that most of those, those come back decisions could be avoided. Where you'd have, you'd make most of the dishes will be very good if you had a group of people who really know their shit and they took in all the factors. Most people would go, that person 36 years old, whatever it was, 37 38 he's been starched whatever many times. He's not the same as I'm moving the same. Right. He's got to stop. Okay. How's he supposed to make more and more important? How do you tell him to stop when you tell people it's okay to sky. Dot.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       We tell people it's okay to base jump. It's a wingsuit and jump off a cliff. But is it also worth it? Like if I'm a professional fucking swimmer, that's like me having this great career and be like, this is fucking crazy, man. I got wet. Yeah, you jumped in water. You can get wet, you fight, you get punched in the face and head trauma, same shit. So we know what we're signing up for. Not the same shit though. And the reason it's not the same shit as that head trauma and the d and the damage that these guys are taking, they're going to pay for for the rest of their life. And it's life shortening. I don't think you could say the same thing about things like swimming and things. So you don't think we know that that's like, and I hate him more. And soldiers, a soldier sign up for the Marines, get going out on a fucking tour getting shot me like what the fuck this is bullshit man.

Speaker 2:          02:14:15       And addressing the fact that you don't get to be a fighter and a great fighter. Uh, like a lot of the guys without being objective is probably not your friend in the ring when you're a young man that's in all sports though. Football, Joe Montana, which if it was up to him, he'd still be slinging. Football's a 49 or is that 60 years old for every athlete's going to keep going till? Well, the NFL and NBA is, it's very simple, right? Nope, there's a young guy, we're not paying anymore. It really bums me out that they'd go after a guy like Roger Clemens for using growth hormone to throw a ball faster. Cause like why? Like he's, yeah, he's using some stuff, but by the way, that stuff's not illegal. It's not like he's using math. Okay. He's using stuff that's legal. You can buy it that your body produces anyway.

Speaker 2:          02:15:03       Your body produces in any way. Scientists developed it. It makes your body work better. And all he's doing is prolonging his career, throwing a baseball. He's investing in itself. No one's getting hurt from Roger Clemens taking growth hormone and still throwing. Every guy that he's pitching to is on the same shit. So what's the point? And he's not hurting these guys. It's not like he's kickboxing and because of this, he's alive. He's showing up with hyper human hormone levels that allow him to absorb punches like tic tacs and just see guys down raw Vandelay in his prime with that kind of shit. It comes back down to the old idea of competition sport on a fair playing field. That's where that's, that would be the argument that the commission would make and baseball, right? They'd say, well, you know you, you, you're, you have an advantage.

Speaker 2:          02:15:49       Then over the doesn't have an advantage because he's still just a picture and it's not like he's throwing some ball 190 miles an hour when no one's ever seen that before. Throwing, he's throwing pitches at a normal speed. I mean, he's not doing anything unusual. I mean, you know what I'm saying? I do. It's, I mean I think baseball is one of the worst arguments. I agree when it comes to steroids and the amount of crap that Barry Bonds Tuck, like just being booed and bro, look bro, he just broke the three thousands home run. It's insane. He just passed like Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth. I was she and that is his piano cover it. There's a little ticker at the bottom, but not a lot. The Yankees, he spoke at all of these bonuses. There's Matthews are saying, nope, we can't mark this because you're known as a steroid user.

Speaker 2:          02:16:35       Yeah. He's like, what the fuck to my contract? You want me $6 million if I hit this milestone, that's never been done. How many new Yankees are saying, nope, we can't do it. We can't market you. Hold on a second. You voided the contract. I'd been testified for steroids. Is that true? 100% true. So he, did he void his contract and be legally, is it void the I, I, I'm not, I don't know the contract, but they're not paying him and he's not putting up a fight either. Wow. Look at Barry Bonds, Marty golden gloves and Barry Bonds, one nine sat a shitload and that steroids are not can help you necessarily field balls to that level and that skill, well that's not true. It's going to help you run faster. You're going to get to the ball quicker. But I'm saying like you said, to your point, a great deal of baseball is skill.

Speaker 2:          02:17:17       And I would say steroids for baseball allow you to play longer so we'll know. It definitely allows you to hit a ball harder. I understand. And be your bad speed. Faster. Bat weighs less too, but you also play longer. You can also just play into your late thirties where you probably couldn't because your bat speed slows down. Now do you think, and this comes with bullying and all this shit, do you think with society become a little bit sissy sissified now it's like head traumas, a baker deal. Cause head traumas always been there and it's about, we know more about it though. We know more about it, but at the same time it's like, oh, we should stop this football. They shouldn't play with helmets. Well, when I signed up for football, I'm like, all right, I'm clashing. My helmet, he gets that dude. It's probably not safe.

Speaker 2:          02:17:54       Yeah, but, but I do it. You thought it was about your bowel was wrong. Now as we learned more and more about not only what it does but the longterm effects are harder to, it's harder to condone it when you know that the people that are doing it right now are going to pay a very steep price or could paste. It's harder for society, I think, to deal with that. A lot of athletes, they're variable. I think if you asked most of the athletes like came in, your brain's going to get fucked up. It's going to take 10 years off your life. He's still going to do it. Most of them say yes. Well, because the hearing, yes, they have no other options. I think that those stories existed before of the guy who got a concussion and the coach put them back in there and then he got paralyzed moments later, but they never get broadcast because it wasn't the Internet.

Speaker 2:          02:18:38       So those stories were trapped in Toledo, Ohio and some, you know, some parents would tell their friends and it would be a tragedy, but it would never make it across the globe right now. Those stories become huge international stories. You also see your childhood heroes talking about how they don't remember it. And Tony Dorsette did that interview and talked about how he just forgets where he is, what he's doing. Dicta Mike Ditka Hall of fame coach Hall of fame player was like, if I knew the repercussions is going to have on my players and myself, I would never play football. I would never coach any of it. And they go, would you let your sons or your grandkids play football? He goes, nope, that's not right. That's Mike motherfucking Mr Football Dick. That's so cranes and the trail and talked about the fact that his son wants to play football.

Speaker 2:          02:19:22       And he said, well, that's not going to happen until you can basically you're in what, sophomore or junior in high school until your head start to develop and maybe college. Well then you're not playing right. It's stupid. But that's what makes it that material. And it played what for seven years it was like, I don't want my son playing football right now. Isn't that amazing? Like he's fighting and MMA in the UFC and he's like, Dad, that's not as dangerous. That football things. What you really should be worried about. I disagree really. I mean, I played in both. Yeah. I think my breath bad. Right? Yeah. Neither one. Neither one's good for your health. What's, what's worse do you think? Both will. Okay, so let's, let's just say for example, so what, this, uh, 2016, it'd be my eighth year in the UFC, right? Eight years in the NFL.

Speaker 2:          02:20:03       I'm set for life. I get a stipend every month. Every time at playing on 401k. I'm good man. I don't have to go fucking figure something else out to do. I can live off that. I'll be all right. I'd full benefits. UFC, I take some head trauma, which I'm going to get if I'm in for eight years and I retired, uh, January 2nd after eight years. There's no stipend, there's no 401k. I have no options. I better figure some shit out. These thing that fell. I, I'm still gonna get head trauma, but at least I at least I'm going to get compensated for it down the road. And it's not [inaudible] fault because u of c right now, you know we're getting there, but we're in leather helmets. If his NFL NFL said it's been around a long time, it's a smooth operating machine. There's a player's union.

Speaker 2:          02:20:44       So I get that. But if I had to pick least least, if I'm with severe head trauma, at least I don't have to when I retire, at least take something back. What does that make sense? Yeah. What do you think what but what the from the actual doing of the sport, and I know it probably depends on the position, but the say a free safety or someone does that, does a free safety take more head trauma than somebody who is an active fighter in the UFC? I don't think so. No. I don't think she uses because they the protection of the helmet on and then if you're talking, if you're a heavyweight, you swine with other 260 plus pound professional athletes and when you're sparring, especially now we have more, we have more knowledge and guys aren't sparring and much taking as much, you know, hits.

Speaker 2:          02:21:23       But I had a day, I mean you get hit with a jab from the UFC heavyweight, it's gonna fuck your brain up man. And you're going to get hit. It's what? It's what you signed up for him? Yeah. There's really no way around it. No. It's part, it's part of the game. Talking to Tony Jeffries, I mean when he was, he was like calculating in the how many fights, how many head, how many hits he took to the head. He didn't the average 55,000. He said if he got hit, uh, six times around in the head, which is low, if you got to hit six times. And he asked how many rounds he did an amateur fights and pro fights came out to white light. You five thousand fifty five thousand hits to the head and then I did, I kind of did it on my calculator and he was right.

Speaker 2:          02:22:00       I was like, God damn. Well, think about George Saint Pierre. We know he got hit 800 plus times inside the Oxford. Crazy by world class fighters. How many gloves on? Yeah. How many times did you get hit in the head of the gym? You know how many, how many different rounds did he spar? And he goes, hard man has to those hard. He does, Huh? And against the very best in the world. Once they come out, if they come up with a way to regenerate brain cells, they come up with a way to fix. Like if they come up with some sort of stem cell injection when they can regenerate your tissue, oh then we're good and we're good. Fuck yeah. Until that had the best sport in the world. Yeah. Then it's like, man, why worry about it? Yeah. You know, maybe they give you some shit.

Speaker 2:          02:22:40       It makes you way smarter than everybody else. Once you get brain damage like that movie. What's that movie trying to reverse engineer the brain. That's the brain project in both China and, and they say they're not even close to the brain. So complicated that every everything else, they're good brain. They can't figure it difficult. It's a 10 year project and then nuts. Yeah, they just, I think they're coming really close to reverse engineering the red blood cell of a dog, which means that then they'll be able to do it with a human, which really means they'll be able to replicate it with a tiny machine. Well, that's what Kurzweil was saying. Kurzweil was saying they're going to come up with artificial blood cells that are so efficient. You'll be able to take one deep breath and go to the bottom of a pool for an hour.

Speaker 2:          02:23:22       Yup. Yup. How about that? How about that and sprint, you'll be able to sprint on a breath. I can just run two sports will never be the same. It won't be an ever be the same. It'd be fun, man. Thousand Years from now till strength won't be, it won't be good. No, it's going to be so different. It'll be, it'll be the technology in your body. What can you afford? You know, it's cool. It will not cool as people are going to be like, you know what? I want my kid to play like Lebron James and looked like Brad Pitt. Well, but that raises that race is not good playing level. Like you want people to be different man raises what? Like then if say you could do that, say you can engineer and like the perfect person, right? Then it would then it would be, it would raise really weird questions about what a human being is because so much of what we define a human being, you know, based on what their will and their ability to figure out how to make someone smart or make someone have a good personality makes someone have a funny sense of humor.

Speaker 2:          02:24:17       The sense of humor, especially unique. You can't really engineer that with a computer. How you put it all together and you may even have a guy look like Brad Pitt all you want. If somebody like you comes along and goofs on him and he falls apart. Thank Gosh, that's huge. Like look at you. You're not genetically engineered Aria, what would you have done without that? Probably Starve. You know, they'll get you your fucking science process. You're going to walk away with a girl. That's what we were talking about that like with an athlete where were like, there is in the human element, there's the unmeasurable, there's something called Sante humor personality, things like, so we were talking about athletes like you can, you can mention the best athlete I can run the fastest, jumped the highest, you know, all that stuff. Yet somehow they don't win games the way somebody who does all that stuff in an average way it does or not as well. So Wayne Gretzky didn't have the fastest slap shot and even close with in the fastest skater. Somehow he could put it all together. And the question becomes how much of a factor is that measure in when you talk about how good an athlete, somebody who does Larry Bird, Larry Bird was never a great athlete, but his fucking accuracy. And those three pointers, his competitive edge had edge demeanor and confidence and disability.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       Getting into the other player's head. The biggest trash talker. Yeah. I mean, you know, you're looking at a guy that's like a pasty white dude. It didn't look anything like Brian James. So awesome. So dope that, but that is that, that weird human x factor that thank God exists because technology may be moving forward, but it, Tony, you're a football fan when you watch it. Do you care that there's brain trauma going on? Oh, of course. Yeah. It's fucking crazy. But you still watch it every Sunday. Yeah. And fighting you. What? Like you just what do you, so you realize [inaudible] got brain damage. Correct. Don't give a fuck. I got to, I got a couple of bad concussions back in high school. Wrestling days. Got Stuck in a head, scissors and a guy slammed my head, you know, he pops back and I was out. I woke up with Puke all over me on the mat.

Speaker 1:          02:26:08       That helmet that you were wearing, that cryo helmet, those guys contacted me. You liked that? I liked the, I like what they're doing for, you know, just cool me is a, a really cool non profit organization, um, that basically tries to get the word out there that when you have head trauma, uh, he was a veteran. Uh, I think Daniel Damn, Daniel Ortega, Daniel or teas, uh, I'm sorry, I can't, Daniel wins. I was, I think his name is, and he runs it and he was at, he wasn't skinny, he was Mexican. He was asking me this or take solid solid Daniel Gonzalez. The last was, sorry Daniel for not getting your new ido. But Daniel was in the, in the military and I believe he's a medic. And one of the things that they found is that when you have head trauma and you cool somebody immediately you cool their head right away.

Speaker 1:          02:26:53       It can, it can be very, very beneficial to stopping longterm, um, uh, trauma. And this guy who, the Cryo Hammad Guy Douglas, uh, he, his brother's a boxer. He was a boxer and his brother actually has a gym. And so he created this basically this cryo Hammad where you just put in the freezer and you just put it on your head after contact and he sent it to you because you're worried about head trauma. He told me though, because he listens to the podcast, he goes, stop boxing. He goes, what are you doing? He goes, stop boxing and don't box. There's no reason to, and if you insist on it, fucking cool your head. But you're getting your bell rung when your box. No, no. I mean he'll catch me, but it's not. I'm fine. Then you go home and you put on the cryo helmet.

Speaker 1:          02:27:35       No, I don't do it. I just got it. I will now will. The guy was smart sent to you and Joel Road Elementary. He's a great guy. It's very smart fighter. But I'm doing it because I think I just call me as a nonprofit. I use barn with Wayne Macola. Yeah. And Wayne McCullough was just like popping you going with when Mikala [inaudible] Mikala moves around with me. I try to his horse with other guys though. I seen him as part of the you guys. I'm like, what are you doing? But they're not. What does it look like when, Gosh, you haven't seen me in a long time. Well, no, I was going to help you up. Brian. Brian's foot works better and all of his foot works better than all these guys. I mean, he's not leaking this fucking guy. Yeah, look, so when you take off your cryo helmet, is there a guy with a blow dryer and a holster there to fix her hair? Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       Is, but Brian is getting hit in the head when he's sparring. Not Hard. Still hits to the head. He's still trauma to the head. I know. I like doing it though. I liked box. I don't get it. Why don't you just do Jujitsu? That's why I fucking to start doing. Why don't you do it? I'm going to, well, why don't you, I'm trying to box. I have time. I'll do it. I played tennis. But you were a good grappler when you were a good grappler. Yeah, I know. I missed the show. I remember when we first started training, when I first brought you in to Carlson Gracie's, you will go hard, man. You'd go after those. You're going to roll this Saturday with Tarik and Jake shields. I can't wait. How will I do against Jake? Be you going to get mauled? Come on dude. Oh Man.

Speaker 3:          02:29:00       You seen the way I hark and Jake shields. Gene do great Brian. She's just saying thank you and last time you were old. It doesn't matter bro, because what happens is I square up. What are you going to do? Take me down. Hold on a second. You guys can, uh, in San Francisco. Is that what's going on? You're going to train up there? Fuck. Are you doing up there? What are you guys done to get to the punchline and then he's coming over and we're going to have two meetings with sponsors, one for personal and one for the podcast, and then we're going to have fun like row with Jake Shields. I can't wait. Yeah, that'd be fun for about three seconds. I mean, I have no business piece. It's squashed. No pain with Jake first week of May cause he's getting ready to fight. So all he's working on his leg locks.

Speaker 3:          02:29:39       He's a fucking monster. Jake's a beast. He's a very good man. Very much the way to 20 really? No one seven. Exactly. Once I got to understand like jobs inside, my weight's on my feet. He's, he's made out of lead cut down to reign him. If you cut down to one 40 I'll wrestle. You wrestle off 40 I couldn't suck that kind of weight cut loose 30 pounds. I think you could do it, dude. I have to do it. I think you'd do it, man. I'd have thought. Yeah. What are you scared? One 45 can I suck? I have to do a cooking show yesterday talking about my diet and how strict it two oh five is based. Just me bullshit him the whole time they're going to hear this. I don't give a fuck. They're like, so like right now. Where are you at?

Speaker 3:          02:30:25       I'm like, like right now. No now. But like, yeah. Do you have a scale here? I'm like, I don't, so I wear like this tight black shirt. I looked like fucking John Claude van Damme like black shirt, but giants. He is so enormous. We were, he hadn't eaten and we would done a podcast and he's like, I'm starving. I'm starving. And I can see the friends. He'd look in his eyes. He's got a food issue and horrible food we'd go to to take away my favorite places. He orders, he orders, he orders a sandwich. That's the cooking. Show me bullshit my way through this diet. Where's this at? Where? That's my house. Nice. Yeah. And so what does this show? What does this cooking show? Ah, just basically the beak ground. Slim down because I, I know ray was there. No, I said watch out. Like I wish Rachel Ray was this. Yeah. Hell yeah. She loves people and looked like a burly. You look like a burly cook. There you are. Early Cook. If you're a cooking dude, do you know the car

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       model post that would go your way with your shirt off? You know what though? Like Shit, and I was so hungry. We went to Juliana's takeaway so much and he goes like this. He finally, he goes, he looks at me, he looks at me after we ate, and he goes and I go, what's up with this? I'm getting another piece of pizza, and I go, well, kind of things. I am Brian. I'm going to do it, and I, all right, there's nothing goes great. You're not going to jump off the 50 foot cliff. He goes, I'm doing it. And he goes, I'd like another piece please like a little dot two cookies and you're talking to a girl and I see her looking at Mego. Brian, I'm debt. Yes, I got your cookies and pizza, man. I'll tell you what you've never seen before. Who you want to see something nuts.

Speaker 2:          02:31:58       You need to see Ari Shaffir eat at Fogo de Chao. I eat a lot of food too, but I can't fuck with Ari when he has an all you can eat buffet at Fogo de Chao fogo they have the chip. They flip it over. I don't know how he does it. He got EOD. It's all of us. It's because of his Jewishness. He sees the opportunity to fulfill upon. It's good. It's like a berry just cause it's all you can eat. It's, I don't know how he does it, but do you eat because you're, I mean your lean dude and I see your post at night where it's like Moose fucking meat so you're not eating a lot of carbs that doesn't put your weight on. Well I don't eat much carbs. It's like if I limit my pasta to like only a couple portions a week and I live at home, I'm bread.

Speaker 2:          02:32:38       Yeah, I don't, I don't believe in it. I think pasta is mostly just dough and gee, it's a fucking golf. It's like when you eat it, it's just doughy. Julie, massive fucking, it's just so like coming. And Lou did you just have great genetics? Well I have really good genetics for sure, but I definitely eat a lot of good food. I get a lot of vegetables. Like what was your breakfast? I haven't eaten yet. Do you have any at all? I hit this bar. Do you do that on purpose? Like intermittent fast day, late at night, late at night. And had five eggs and I had some steak and I want to go sleep. I can't eat protein at night. I literally, I'm asleep if I did that. If I eat eggs and steak or beef, I would wake up two hours later in a DNA hot sweat and I have to throw the covers off and I would be up awake for another three hours.

Speaker 2:          02:33:23       I can't do it. Guess what? I can sleep on carbs. Big Bowl carbs. No problem. Why? Why is that? What? It depends on your metabolic type apparently from what I've read like, and I'll give you a questionnaire. Would you, can you eat carbs at night and you sleep well right through the night if you eat protein, if I eat any protein, I'm fucked. See I, if I eat carbs like I feel like weighed down. Like if I eat a bowl of pasta, I love Spaghetti man, like Spaghetti and meatballs. I'm in heaven. I love it. How about, how about right after it's over, it's just went after. It's over. I'm just like, oh, I just hate glue. You know what the, you know what the problem I'm having sticking to a strict diet is when you have a goal, like when you know you have a motherfucker look Andrea loss, you're going to fight a cro cop. It's easy to be strict as fuck right now because you're afraid basically I have a goal. You have a goal in mind. Like right now, you know there's, there's no, like I said, I'm only taking a fight if it's a super fight. I told, I told them that

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       so, but there's nothing set right. Right. Right now it's like tonight I'm going out to this dinner. It's like all right, well usually I'd go out and I'd eat super strict but in my head like when I get the minion I'm like for what? Why would I eat superstar? Just enjoy food man. I, and then I'm worried about getting fat and cause I have body dysmorphia. Yeah, the best boss. Like girls, look at your body. What about when we saw Mika Kelly, how embarrassed was that? And I like sat, I'm just kidding me. Kelly is, it is, it is a, an actress and I think she was on the hills or something. She dated Derek Jeter. I, she got the same place. She's, you hide your function. She's looking, they're looking at him that the three girls, I'm looking at Brent, I'm going to turn Brennan and Brennan goes like this, Brendan, because we're eating how we're just down the way.

Speaker 3:          02:35:01       And he goes, um, I, I'll take a box please. I'm going to take this to go. And I got hot and he puts it in a box and I said, I was like, that's weird and I'm eating away. As soon as they leave, he goes, I'll be honest with you. I didn't want her to think I was a fat ass. And he opens it up to stretch out even remotely. Fallon, I don't know. You know what I was telling, Brian isn't telling me. He goes, why are you like that? Cause I'm not like, like I don't look like Alistair Overeem and when I was in high school or girlfriends said something to me before, like, oh, huge competition. She's like, God, be nicer. If you had a little flatter stomach and since then like my high school stupid by the right time to get over that, huh? Well, I don't get bullied.

Speaker 3:          02:35:43       So time to get over that. Get over that right now. It was only 20 years ago. It was some time. Some time. Man. Let's see here. Would Vinny shoreman said the hypnotist that I had in the podcast, he was talking about this guy who was six years old who was standing on a top of a hill and he was looking down. He was like, well, why don't you go down? He goes down and those guys are down there. They used to bully me in high school. He's 60 and the guys who used to bully him in high school, we don't. He was waiting for them to leave before he went down. That said, whoa. Like he was looking, don't happen to me. I got bullied for a full year and it turned me into a fucking, if somebody tried to blow me, I'll show up at your fucking house and kill you. That's what happens. I get so angry. I'm not buying that. When he talks about, I hate when you fucking bullying bullying me right now.

Speaker 3:          02:36:30       You've talked to too many guys that let you say shit like that and then it becomes like vernacular comes like a part of the way [inaudible]. I know when I first met you, all those people used to hang around with. Those are all toxic and they've ruined the way you're allowed to communicate with people because they said stupid shit. And then you said if somebody who was looks for any bro, look at how am I, what do you have to say to me? Well what's the scary movie with the law? We have to hold on just a scary movie with them. And it was the most annoying thing to me. What? He goes, fuck this guy. I can wish a demon would grab me, man. You know what I would do? And I'm like, I get mad. Why are you talking to me? He's like, not that you get mad.

Speaker 3:          02:37:10       It's so you hang around with people for a long time you hung around with people that allowed you to talk like that. No, without mocking [inaudible] Bros, Bros pros. Let's not fuck some. You bully me Bro. I don't give a shit about your USC bullshit. I will fucking come right at you. I could pin it on the ground right now and put me into the trial. You could try. You could try and guess what? She gets the Nice, that's why I would fucking come right to your house. You'd be dead Joe. Yup. He needs friends like us cause he gets it around saying guys who don't know, I'm putting it away to muck around with all lot of idiots. There's a lot of people that he hangs around with full of shit that they're, they're, they're dumb.

Speaker 3:          02:37:53       I feel sick. I feel sick. You do. You hang out with a lot of people that are such bullshit. Artists know and you don't. You know, you know who I'm talking about. You have friends that are bullshit artists and you don't even realize that. You know. You know why I know you do and you've had them from the moment I met you and they lie each other. I met Brian and 94 he's surrounded by idiots. I was like, what's going on here? With these fucking people. Come on. They try to drag you away. Slowly and surely guys, I pushed those people off cliffs. Slowly but surely I separating him from most, they're like, hey, your friend doesn't like me. I was like, well, just a little hard to, he's hard. He can push a marrying one of them at a certain point in time. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          02:38:35       Everybody was, everybody else was like, it's good luck. Good luck brother. No, it's going to work out. It's gonna work. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about you out of your mind? You out of your mind. It's just me and patty were the only one that was telling. I remember Gotti here. You're not married. You did save me dude. All meet people or I'll meet some people with celebrities or not and for some reason I was like, God, real good. Fucking hate this purse. That's the way I think of things like job they would thing is that Joe will actually like kind of let it be known or at least just be kind of right away. Just ignore them really hard and I never do that. Well you can't. You can't ruin my life.

Speaker 3:          02:39:16       Those people are that they, it's almost like this. People have energy. He's afraid it's going to stick to them. They do stick to you. They become a part of your life and then you have to deal with their bullshit. You have to do, you have to like pretend that what they're saying is not retarded. And when you do that, you compromise the way you think and behave and communicate with you. Nip It in the butt right away. Even on your show, you nip it on. But, but even like before we can do a show in here, this guy had this bullshit machine and you're like, Bro, this is fucking terrible. That armbar thing. Bone in my body. I tried to help people's feelings since meeting you. I'm getting better at it. You can't do that because it's not bad for them. I'm not saying you're a loser, you're a bad person. I'm saying this, this, the idea, one plus one doesn't equal six. You know it's funny, but saying it equals six. I'm like, this is crazy. This is not, there are two people I've known in my life who had really bad breath. One was a girl, the guy the worst route, and nobody wants to tell the same guy, the same guy. We know that's another guy. You have three, but I can't live your whole life and have bad breath. No one says a word. Want to sit there. And I kept saying,

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       how do I tell this person? And I never could because I felt like I wasn't quite close enough. But it was always, and so they've been walking around with bad breath. We have a mutual friend and I've left it up to count. I go, bro, tell him his breath smells like pure shit broke. It would ricochet off the car window. And I'm like, who farted? Who's bars in my car? Was his breath like an open call Brian? I'm like, Bro, please tell him no. So we just chilled for a nice three hour car ride in this pure shit. Eat Shit. I just saw him the other day too. The problem is, I don't know how, what do you like? Oh yeah, bad breath. And what do you say to them? Go to a doctor. What's a doctor's wife would tell him? I know your nose is broken.

Speaker 2:          02:40:56       Maybe she had a head injury. I think when you have head injuries you're fucking, your nose gets a year. No, it doesn't work. Oh good. Maybe Marcus Davis lost his sense of smell for a long time. My friend. Yeah, my Goddamn head trauma pho. That's one of the things that Rhonda Patrick talked about when we had her on the podcast. She was talking about what the, the mechanism that goes off in your brain to protect you. Like when you start getting really serious head trauma, they just, certain switches started just shutting off. She's a circuit breakers. Sense of smell is a big one. Taste right. And some guys have taste, taste, taste and smell and losing your taste and smell. When you smell, a lot of times you lose your taste as well. Yeah, yeah. I connected. Yeah. I mean you're fine. You're fine. Right now it's the w, you know the, the guys who just continued to get that fucking head trauma over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

Speaker 2:          02:41:44       No trouble. And then the gate and I like the knee than what we're talking about. Dude. I'm honestly, I'm going to get spot man. Like I was telling Brian this the other day, like before companions like, dude, I can't before fight companions before the podcast. Sometimes I can't sleep at night. I'm so excited to do it. When, when, when our shirts we get released, it's the same to me is that when I fight I'm that excite for them to fucking drop. And so that's awesome. It's awesome man. Thank you. So long as you're doing something you really enjoy, that is really the key to life purpose, but you want to wake up with a perfect cause. He shows that we're, we've been doing lately, you're working on new material and just like trying to get it together. Like it's exciting before while you're doing it.

Speaker 2:          02:42:20       And Caitlin, it's exciting when it, and afterwards you listening to the recordings, trying to figure out how to tweak the joke and add this to it. As long as you're doing something, building something. Yeah. It's, it's building something. Yeah. So I think one of the big problems that we were talking about like fighters have is at once the career's over, there's no more progress. There's nothing. Where do you place your energy? Yeah. What's happening? Where's your, where's your excitement? You know, you mean there's only so many gyms you can open. Yeah. And that's not gonna fulfill that fucking the, the constant pulse you always used. Didn't really know what I'm saying. I don't know what you do, man. The answer. Believe me, I'd fucking kill everybody. And that's why a lot of guys like the one I'm going to drugs. They want to go into something to try to forget it, man. Yeah. Recharge that excitement. Yeah. Get that juice. Need it. Get your shit together, bitches. We're going to wrap this up nice and tight with a big fat bow fighter and the kid.com Tony motherfucking in the house.
