Speaker 1:          00:00:02       So I might plug some dates or like do it, do it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       And we're live. Judd, how are you buddy? Yeah, Judd apatow here, dude. You know susman real well. Not only do I know your manager, sussman judge Sussman when I was a kid, I loved comedy. So I got a job at the east side comedy club that would just in Huntington on long island. This is about 83 84 he was the bartender and he used to give me rides home because I lived really far away and I used to take a cab home and spend all the money I made as a dishwasher on the cab ride home. Wow. But I just wanted to be in the club near comics. Eddie Murphy was coming in. It was crazy. Uh, and I swear to God, this is no bs. You have those people in your life that you remember who were insanely kind and cool. And Jeff Sussman was like that.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       As a, as a young kid, I was maybe 15 or 16. I thought, this is the greatest guy I've ever met. He's so nice to me. It gives me a ride home. He's funny and I'm so glad, uh, that he's rich now. He's been my manager since I was an open miker. Yeah, he discovered him. He is an open miker or in Boston. Who are his first clients? Uh, Bob Nelson. Yeah. Bob Nelson at the east side comedy club. Nothing funnier. He used to do a show once a week and one of the things he did is he would just turn on the radio and scan through the channels and do improv based on what was on the radio. So if it was elevated music, he would do a dentist routine. If it was heavy metal, he would suddenly do like a heavy metal guy. And it was incredible.

Speaker 1:          00:01:45       Yeah, that guy was huge at one point in time. And then I think he blew a fuse or something. I think he's a very religious person now and he's still performs in Branson. It's a nice way of saying he blew a fuse. Depends on your view of things. I guess maybe he's happier than all of us. That would be highly unlikely, but maybe, but God, was he funny. I mean truly. It's funny as people get, and then he built a thing on stage. You have to imagine this. He built like a wall on the stage and in the wall he built two doors and he would do all these bits. We would come in and out of doors as different people and then he did a thing where he would like come out of the door like one out of one door across the stage and in the other door and then run out that door again as a different person.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       So it looked like he was chasing himself like it'd be like a gorilla chasing Bob, but he would just change his body language as he ran in and out of these doors. It was really creative. No one has ever really done stuff like that since even, well, something happened somewhere along the line where carrot top owns props. They don't, no one does props anymore. You remember when we first starting out there was prop comics. It was your genre. There was Dennis Miller to do. Perhaps when he started, I heard that he used to put his lips through a 45 record and I forgot what the bid was and die. I threw a couple of props. First few times I went on stage. I remember bringing a light and putting it to my finger to make my finger look like ets finger. I can't quite remember what the bid was, but that's how little material I had.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Isn't it funny though that that genre is just sort of dissolved and it is funny as hell I would to see carrot top in Vegas. I mean it's a ridiculous show. I laughed my ass off. I brought my whole family. We really laughed hard. I mean that is a funny genre of just ridiculous, stupid prop jokes, carrot top case, way more shit than he deserves. He's very funny. Oh no, he's very silly. Funny. I mean I've always, for the silly guys, you know I love, you know all the smart people in the inventive people, but this silly guy is also pretty great and it's hard to write super silly jokes and make people laugh out loud. Like there's Comedians who are funny and you're like, oh, that's funny. And then there are people who actually make you piss your pants. And the one thing that job did, it made me laugh was he was reds around the crowded subway.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       He's like giving the crowd shots, he's handy out cups. I'd really fast pouring shots and they're spilling on people if he's ready around giving people shots. And then he like turned to somebody, he's like, okay, give it to you, you're pregnant. But she clearly wasn't pregnant. It was just a Chubby lady and it got really awkward. No, that's always the best. When you make that mistake, are you allowed to just give people shots? Like what if you have an alcoholic but they're just there. They're sober, but you are like so influential. They go off fucking one drinks, not going to hurt and then boom, you just throw their life off track and carrot top wanted it to happen. Yeah. You gotta be careful with that now. Uh, I certainly am not pouring booze for the crowd, but I appreciated it as someone observing carrot top.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       I appreciate that too. But I would think as a performer you'd have to be really concerned. Too many people that you give them one shot and they uh, they vander Doug stamper from house of cards. Maybe carrot top is getting pre show releases. There can be a whole system of how he knows who to give the shots to. He survives in Vegas too. That does. There's not a whole lot of people that do that anymore. Yeah, there's like Penn and teller and they'd been there forever. Right. But their show is a magic show. Right. And then there used to be like a lot of residents they were doing stand up, George Wallace, Rita Rudner, George George Wallace quit doing that, right? Yeah. He did it for a long time and he had enough at something, something. He explained to me how hard it is like you have to, you have to fill that room like every night. Villain rooms. Let me say, I said I'm going to who makes movies and is terrified that people will show up. Filling rooms scares me as well. Like we have a movie, the big sick, it opens in New York and La this weekend and then in two weeks it opens around the country. It's a kumail, Nanjiani,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Holly Hunter and Ray Romano based on an experience that happened to Kumail Nanjiani when he met his wife and he was, he's from Pakistan and his parents wanted him to have an arranged marriage, but he fell in love with an American woman and then she quickly got sick and had to be put into a coma and it's this really hilarious, fascinating, true story about him hanging out with her parents while she's in a coma. It's just a very unique story, but it works great. It's like 98% on rotten tomatoes. It's like one of those gem movies that comes around every like four or five years. What's it called? It's called the big sick. And so like right now I'm terrified, you know, will people go, will you get off your ass for a great, hilarious movie to go to a theater? And it's the same thing with a stand up, you know, now that I'm doing some concerts, I do you like track like how they're selling.

Speaker 2:          00:06:48       It's a scary thing. They go, yeah, don't worry about this city. Uh, they always sell late and then you look at your numbers for months and no one bought tickets. And then like in the last two weeks they sell out or do you just not tuned in at all? I try to tune into as little as I possibly can. Yeah. Other than like doing the jokes themselves, doing the shows themselves, you know, family, hobbies, yes. I don't tune in anymore. I just feel like there's no reason to have fuck you money if you don't say fuck you. So I'm supposed to be saying fuck you right now. Yeah. But not really saying fuck you. Just, there's things to think about and there's things to not think about. Like there's like the things that like, you don't have really any control over, like whether or not people buy tickets if fucking hilarious.

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       Yeah. What are you worried about man? You're super successful. You've done some of the greatest movies of all time, but the things that always drive me is the terror of things not working out. You know? That's what keeps me on my game is, is to be scared. That's why I'm going to tell your crowd right now. That's good because that's one of the reasons why you're still good, but just let me help you out, dude. You've, you've, you have to care. Greatest comedy movies ever. Just chill out. No, I can't chill out, Joe. I can't chill out. That's why I'm going to tell people I'd be at the Columbus Theater and Providence Road at July 25th, uh, early with the plot and then a play playhouse on July 23rd in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Then I met the, the Wilbur in Boston. That's one of the great, the best place, right? Great Place.

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       Do you have a website where people could read all these cause they're not going to remember. They're probably in their car right now. They're like fucking the Wilburn boss and July 24 of the wilbur.com. I don't know. See this is how I, your website. No website. I've got nothing. You don't have a website? I don't I suppose to, I thought websites. My kids make fun of me. If I even talk about the web. Like if I say like kids. Yeah, let's find out on the of the worldwide web. They like dad. No one calls it the worldwide web anymore. My daughter yelled at me the other day. She said, dad, no one emails don't email me, text me. And she acted like I was like talking about ham radio. Yeah. You might want to tell your kid to shut the fuck up. Exactly. Like emails. Everybody. I email every, what are you talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       I guess the kids don't, the kids don't have attachments. I think that they don't need it cause there's no attachments. Like it never has a pdf to send. That's true. And they don't spell your, they don't care. Every kid spells you are every fucking thing there. And what, how old are your kids? I have a 20 I have a nine and a seven girls. All, yeah, I'm old girls. I'm 19 and 14 old girls. Chaos, chaos and they'll gang up on me and the teen years are rough. They were rough. They turn on you a little bit. The genetically, I think they're supposed to like push for their freedom and turn on you for a while. I also think they're so confused. There's so many hormones raging to their system that didn't exist just to like there were a new person. Like if you, if you stop to think about how you are when you're 11 and then how you are when you're 15 it's only four years later and you're a totally different human. Yes. I tell them that. I say you're acting hormonal right now. Can you please stop? They can't help. But we talk about the chemicals. I have this book, it's called a yes, your teen is crazy. And then whenever they give me a hard time, I just take it out and just reading it in front of them.

Speaker 2:          00:10:05       But it is all about how their brain isn't even cooked yet. Right. Your brain doesn't really cook til your early twenties and you're impulse control and everything is gone. And that what you're supposed to do as a parent is model, same behavior. And if they, if they see you not lose your shit thousands of times maybe that we'll program them to handle problems as well, but they are going to freak out a ton and you shouldn't get that mad out of them at them because they're not capable of not freaking out. But that is a hard advice. It's hard advice. And when you get down to the youngest one, like my, my youngest is seven and I'm like, don't you have your shit together yet? Come on. Everybody else is older than you. Let's go, let's go. So they don't get a full shot. But the younger kid always thinks they're allowed to do with the older kids.

Speaker 2:          00:10:49       Do. So it gets scarier as, as you have more kids, right, because they go, well my older sister does that so aren't and I allowed to do that now. And you're like, no, you're seven. Uh, yeah. It's, it's a really weird time. I think especially in California, you know, marijuana is basically legal. It's a d it's a difficult debate to have with kids. What it is legal. You can't even pull out the, it's illegal card. Right. I'm not worried about marijuana. And what age though would you not worry about marijuana? I'm not worried about it at any age. If your seven year olds like, you know what? Someone handed me an edible. Absolutely don't want my seven year old or my nine year old to be smoking pot. But I'm not worried about pot morgan about alcohol. Yes, I'm worried about alcohol and I'm worried about driving.

Speaker 2:          00:11:33       I'm worried about like teens drinking and driving. That's that. That freaks me out. Like her being with her friends as they go to high school and that, that freaks me out because kids just don't know what their tolerances are. They don't understand the effects of alcohol on the body and your ability to react. That's curious. It's all about uber or lyft. I think that is one thing I noticed that all the kids are, there seems to be a lot less drunk driving cause they all just uber. Oh it's amazing if you can afford it, but if you can't afford it, I guess you're still screwed. Yeah, you are screwed if you can't afford it. But it's pretty reasonable if you're just moving around the general area. Like if you're hopping around West Hollywood and going from the store to the Improv, people do it all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:12:15       It's a couple of bucks. It's not that big a deal and it's like it's saves you all the worry and hassle of being a drunk. Are you a neurotic dad or a calm dad? I tried to be as calm as I can. You know, certain amount of neurotic that's seeks in seeps in every now and then, but I try to be really calm. Yeah. Yeah. The, you know, the thing is just everybody does it. Everybody grows up and just haven't have it. Be Fun as much as possible. I have a friend, uh, it older gentleman who's had a bunch of kids. He's always, he's always said to me, you know, you got to let him go through it. You know, they're going to good. They're going to do the drugs. It's fine. They get through it. They figure it out. You know, you got, they're going to have sex.

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       You can't stop it. You get to let them go through it. They'll, they'll figure it is your friend. The dude from the big Lebowski is, it's a, it's literally a John Goodman. I sat down with the dude was, uh, what's his face? Not John Goodman, the other guy. What's his name? Jeff. Uh, Jeff. Fuck. Oh, Jeff Bridges. Jeff Bridges. Yeah. He's a dude. Yo, he's the dude in the movie, right? Yeah. I saw it the other day. I haven't seen it in years. I was fucking crying, laughing. Oh, it's a good way. It used to be my movie, my litmus test for whether or not I could talk to you. Like, how do you feel about the Bagel basket booster? Shit, I got to go. Yes, we did an episode of freaks and geeks where he shows John Daly's character saying we're shows a girl of the jerk and she hates it and, and he breaks up with a cheerleader at school cause she hates the jerk.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       Good for him. I said with a girl in high school where she hated n e t and I and that was a rough one to where it rough on to survive back then. Yeah. There's certain music and there's certain movies that you're just not allowed to like or hate. Yes. Yeah. Well that's a funny thing. My wife and I is, we violently disagree on a lot of that stuff. We don't have like one or two violently. Yeah, there's, there's one or two like the main things that mean the most to me in the world where my wife's like I can't, I can't, I don't like it at all. And then stuff that she likes it, I go, I hate that more than anything. I think that's good. I think it's good, especially with your spouse to have like very few interests in common. I think all those people that do everything together, a fucking Weirdos man, they always freak me out.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       That it, that is interesting. Yeah. Cause it's a, it's like stand up. My wife, I met her when I wasn't doing stand up. I did stand up from the time I was 17 until I was 24. I met my wife when I was 28 or 29 so she didn't know anything about staying up until three years ago when I started doing it again. Yeah. What, what caused you to do that? I remember when you started coming around, everybody was like look at Judd and was doing, it's funny, I, I uh, I, when I stopped when I was 24, I was pretty burnt out. So that was 92 and I was getting a lot of writing work. The Ben Stiller show got picked up, this sketch show we did for Fox and that kept me busy and I was making, you know, a lot of money compared to the $500 a week I was making, doing standup on the road.

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       And I thought, well, this is the universe saying you don't need to do stand up and you should stop. Maybe your friends are funnier than you. And I'm living with Sandler and I'm hanging out with opening up for Jim Carrey and it's, it's daunting. You know, it's like trying to start a band and your friend is John Lennon. He just feel like it would be weird to not feel like a dick. I was cocky with Jim Carrey and oh yeah, the funnier than this guy. I mean, I'm a sane human being. I know, I know what's happening. Um, and I was also a little bored of it because I was so obsessed since I, since I was 10 and you know, I did funny people, I did a little standup to write jokes for funny people. So I was writing jokes but it was for Adam's character. And then I started hanging out with Amy Schumer working on train wreck and she would come back from these tours and I just got jealous.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       I thought, that sounds like the most fun thing. And then one night I said to her, I'm going to go up tonight just to make you laugh just to, so you could see what it was like when I did stand up. And then I told a couple of stories. I had told her on talk shows and I knew would go okay. And Amy was very excited hoping I was going to bomb. Like she was thought this would be this funny thing. Judd bombs at the comedy cellar and I did pretty good just cause it's stories. I know work okay. And then the common, he's probably said, hey, anytime you want to come back, just pop in, we'll put you up. Now. No one ever said that when I was a comic because it was hard to get stage time. And I thought, wait a second, I'm getting treated like somebody who, who gets the show up and go on stage.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       I have to take advantage of this. And I went on every night, the entire shoot of train wreck. No matter what time we finished shooting, I would drive straight to the comedy cellar. Wow. And I had the best time. And then I came back to la and started doing the Improv and the comedy store in Largo and, and then I would put these benefits together at Largo once a month. And, and to me that was the most fun because I could book a show and get like channeling to come and Randy Newman or you know, Aziz and Fiona apple and we did them all his benefits and I always liked producing things like that. And then slowly my act got to the point where I thought, oh, I'm, you know, I deserve to be here. This isn't some freak show. Well, you know the difference between someone who writes for television and movies and, and the different stream that, and a lot of stand ups is when you're making a living writing and producing and directing and doing all, you're disciplined you right? Yes, actually right. You have notes, you have books you have like you're opening up your binder, you're going over your stuff. So comics don't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I remember when I started, I was opening for Larry Miller, one of the legendary comedians and he, he would have these incredible, but some of them were like 10 minutes long. He had a great bit about, uh, about drinking. It's one of the best standard bits of all time. And he had a bit about Thanksgiving and a skiing and they were all like 10 minutes and they would get funnier and funnier. And one day he said to me, you know, this is a job. You got to sit down every day, write jokes. You don't just go to the mall and watch a movie every day. Like if you sat down for two hours at a desk and treated this like it was a job that deserves your respect, you'll be a hundred times better than everybody else. And I did listen to his advice at the time, but I do now, like now I sit down to write it up.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Yeah. Yeah. I do show up with like notes. You're like one of the rare guys at the comedy store, he'll show up but notes. Exactly. I know nobody has notes. If it has like a little like a business card with three bullet points on it and I'm a little more of the, you know, the shandling tons and tons of paper until you're drowning and confused shandling, you know, that's a sad one, man. Fun Dude that was oh the best. And I'm doing a documentary about him now for Hbo. And so the most fun part about it is he always went to the comedy magic club and did stand up even in eras where you didn't know he was doing it. That's where I met him at the comedy Magic Club. And how was it? I was great. Yeah, I mean it was like for me, I was a huge fan of Larry Sanders show and Larry Sanders show a, that's where Paul Simms got start, a producer of news radio.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       And so when I, you know, when I saw him I was like, it was one of those ones like, oh wow, that's a, that's actually garry shandling right there, right there with judd apatow's right there. It's a weird one. And He, and you know the comedy magical, they tape every show since the 80s they have every show taped. And I said, can you give me the last 50 sets that Gary did? The comedy Magic Club. And this is, you know, from the last few years. And no one's ever seen any of these jokes except that people at those shows, he didn't do him on TV. He didn't do them on talk shows. There was no special, some of the funniest jokes you've ever heard. Just him, you know, working on the craft. How about going around being so funny. Yeah, but he, he did a lot of notes. He was a, his discipline guy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       He was in the 70s he wrote so many jokes. I found these binders, hundreds and hundreds of jokes in every loose leaf binder. Like a guy sitting at a desk all day just crafting like two sentence perfect jokes. Yeah, but there's like the balance, right? There's that. There's crafting the perfect jokes and then there's just being able to be loose and fun and hilarious. Well, he also used to go on stage with a justice setup and he wouldn't know the punchline and he would say the setup and hope the punchline came, which is pretty wild. He, um, you know, one of the, one of the great things about doing a documentary as you get to ask people for footage, so Seinfeld gave me, uh, the dailies for Comedians in cars getting coffee when he interviewed Gary. And then the people who made the movie comedian about Seinfeld gave me all the dailies of a sequence that they only use 10 seconds of in the documentary, which was Gary and Jerry going to the comedy magic club and doing sets.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       And also there that night as Neil and Chris Rock and there's 12 tapes. It's all their performances and then their entire conversation for three hours hanging out backstage. And it is unbelievable the conversation, how funny it is. And, uh, there's a moment where Chris rock is doing the joke about how Nelson Mandela got divorced, that even Nelson Mandela, after decades of being in prison, he could survive that, but he couldn't survive getting out and being married and gets divorced immediately. I forgot how he worded it, but there's a shot of shandling alone in a green room watching rock do this bit. And as he's doing it, Gary's I saying what he, what he's like, he's guessing what the bit is as rock saying it, but in awe of Chris Rock and it's a, it's a really beautiful moment and that's what the best part of doing in this documentary is it just finding little magical moments that no one would ever see if you didn't dig deep.

Speaker 1:          00:22:19       What made you decide to do this? And we did a memorial for Gary when he died at the Wilshire Evil Theater and like a thousand people showed up and I made about five mini documentaries about gary to show in between the speakers and I thought, oh, this is a documentary. I should just expand this. And now it's like, now it's like the Oj doc of Gary. It's a big, long epic documentary. I think people don't realize how good the Larry Sanders show us. Yeah. Like people forgot, you know, if he'd go back and watch it again, that was a revolutionary show and it was on the air. It really was. Well, people don't go backwards. Like my kids don't go backwards digging that far. Like to them, you know, looking backwards means I'll watch all of parks and rec, right. They're not taking into the 90s. Uh, they go to 2015 and people forget that when the Larry Sanders show came on the air, you know, the shows on Hbo, it was like a first and 10 are not necessarily the news or dream on, you know, Gary was the first show on hbo that made Hbo go, Oh, this is what hbo should be.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       We should be the quality, uh, network with all, with this kind of groundbreaking television. And, uh, you know, Gary was a guy who got offered all the talk shows. He got offered to replace, um, he was hosting the tonight show for Johnny. Uh, him and Leno would, would, uh, take turns doing it and he decided he'd rather satirize it then do it, you know, and he wanted to explore the people and not be a talk show hosts. He wanted to show like the world of ego that is not just talk to us but just show business. He was fascinated with people's need for attention, his own need for attention, his own vanity and narcissism. And he wanted to explore that and, and satirize how we just want to be liked so badly. Like what we do to be liked, which prevents us from actually feeling love cause we're so obsessed with approval.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Do you talk to Jay? Do you, are you friends with Jay Leno? Yeah, Jane and I were talking about, um, what it was like to host the tonight show and how much more funny has now doing comedians and cars are not comedians and cars. A Jay Leno's garage. Yes. And because that's what he really loves you and he really loves cars and he gets to be himself while he's doing this. He doesn't have to have people on it. He doesn't want, like he just has people want to talk to them about cars and stuff and has comics on and all kinds of people on. But you know, when he was talking about like having that choice, like you would have people on that, you didn't give a shit about it and you had to talk to them. And for Jay that was most everybody because he loves certain things, but he doesn't love sports.

Speaker 1:          00:25:07       He's not a massive movie Fan. But you got him going on the things he cares about like cars. He's fascinated. But that I think was some of the fun of watching the tonight show, really interviewing a young actress and you know, he doesn't care at all. And how is he going to make it abusing for himself at the audience. Did you see the hex bit that Hicks did about Jay interviewing joy lawrence and he blows his brains out and it forms the NBC peacock or the wall. I mean, I always felt that could loads. I always thought that was very unfair. The Hicks and the Andy kindler criticisms of Leno. Leno was, you know, and as you know, what are the great standups of all time? I mean in a club you'd see letter in the eighties nobody touches it. He was just, it was amazing fun guy and still, I saw him recently at the abrupt still is and you know, he made a call to, you know, to be America's host, beat everyone for forever.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       Forever was proven completely correct. But there was this idea that it was a betrayal of his club persona that some comedians were so mad about. And I don't know how you could be mad at anybody for deciding how to run their show because you know, as we've seen with other people, sometimes snarky guy runs out of gas in two years and you know, jay found the space that was comfortable for him and God was he nice to me every time I was there. He's a great guy and always super funny when I was on the show and Super Nice would put me on when I wasn't doing stand up just as a director just because he liked me as a person. Um, and uh, and a really a good class guy and in the Shanley documentary, fascinating describing his observations of Gary, his observations about talk shows, uh, I mean, what a ride he went on.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       Did that world of being a talk show host. There's not a lot of wiggle room, especially back then, you know, as opposed to now. Now with the Internet, I think a lot of like subject matter and a lot of language has opened up more. You can kind of get it. Like if you see like what's going on now with, uh, with Seth Meyers or you know, any of the other late night talk show hosts, they have much more relic look at core bear gold bear rather coburn said that, you know, Donald Trump, the president uses Putin. Like he uses his mat, like coop Putin uses his mouth as a cock holster. Like he said that on television with the phrase cockles guess they beeped it out. Do you not aware of that? I'm not, that's, it was in the chrome, the long rant. And it was really hilarious because trump, trump, uh, came back and it said a bunch of, think about cold bear and being tasteless and talentless and being a loser and all these different things. Yeah. And cold bear came back again. He goes, Donald Trump, he goes, I thought if there was one thing you understood its shell business. And he goes, you responded. He goes, you responded. I win. You don't understand. Oh fuck. And it was, it was really fucking cool.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Well, trump can't help but respond. Yeah. He has no ability to go. It demeans me to acknowledge you exist. He doesn't understand that. And so I think these easily baited into any of those situations, which is, I think a little is what scares people because you think if Cole bear can paid him. What about other countries and very serious situations? What, what bates him into action that he shouldn't

Speaker 3:          00:28:34       take? Well, he blocks people on twitter. Yeah. He's the fucking president. People are trying to, they're trying to figure out like is that like a first amendment issue? Like was it, am I allowed to communicate with the president directly through twitter? Well now I can't cause he blocks me. Is He allowed to block people? So there's people that are considering lawsuits right

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       now. Does Donald Trump understand you should just be muting people. Just mute them. Donald, you don't have to block now. He wants him to know what I'm going to know Magda. I like blocking people. I love block and people in the second I see anything I blocked somebody who even if they say, what am I? Movies was just okay. I didn't know have to be that main boom. I'll never see you again. Wow. Really? If somebody says that was who, that was pretty good, I'll block them. Block them on almost a compliment. Wow. Almost looks weird. Underhanded stuff. You're not kissing my ass pretty hard. You're gone. That's, that's my twitter theory online. You know, I don't even need you to call me a Jew. That's the funny thing is that when people say nasty things on twitter, they always start sounding like they make sense, but then bail at the end, you know, so they'll just be like, you know, give, give the president a chance.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       You know, [inaudible] was duly elected by the American people and go jump in and nothing. It's always like the, to beat the, the, Oh, they're saying you, it sounds sane and then it always lands on jumping in oven. Did you stop exactly that. Go well. Do you take a lot of heat for criticizing the President [inaudible] Jones? I don't. It's pretty soon. I mean, I don't think I'm saying anything that anyone else's and saying because I have a simple theory about all this stuff, which is I don't think rich people want you to be rich. I think that people are trying to be told that rich people really can handle everything. And if you let the rich people have all the money that they're just going to figure it all out. And in fact, last night was an interesting night because of Donald Trump said he doesn't want poor people in charge of the economy and what, what he said that, yeah, he said he goes, I want rich people.

Speaker 1:          00:30:37       But it's what he's not understanding is there are public servants who have not made the choice to be billionaires who actually understand the economic theories better than, you know, the head of Walmart or something that just because you were able to figure out how to sell m and ms, it doesn't mean you can run the economy. That there are people that they don't want to be rich, they want to help other people. And they are a very smart about ways to help the government work well. And you know, that's like saying a Martin Luther King's that loser because he wasn't rich. He's not smart and this only rich people know how to do things. I find so offensive. And I'm very surprised that people who aren't billionaires aren't more offended at the contempt that they're held in. Cause you could disagree on economic theory. You could say, oh, I believe in trickle down economics, or I don't believe in trickle down economics, but this is a government that thinks if you're not a billionaire, you're an idiot.

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       I mean, I think he thinks that I, you said it last night, it's just not easy. It's a literally a speech, which is, would you want poor people in charge of the economy? Which is the argument for having like the head of Goldman Sachs in charge of the economy, but yet, what is a poor person? How is he defining it? Is he defining it as an idiot failure or someone who hasn't decided to milk, uh, this world for as much money as they can get out of it? Some people are happy to make a comfortable living and try to be giving to other people and they can be very helpful. Uh, being part of our government, you don't have to be the head of Goldman Sachs, uh, to be, uh, to be, uh, someone who can change people's lives for the better. He thinks you just get the head and neck Exxon, the had a Goldman Sachs, but sometimes you don't want the head of Exxon. You want someone that's thought about international relations their entire lives and maybe they've always made 200 grand a year. That doesn't, that's not poor. Like what the, it depends on what your, how you define that core

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       and how he defines poor. Yeah. I mean when you say you don't want to pour person running the economy, I think one argument for that would be you don't want anybody who wants radical redistribution of wealth. One article, one Om argument while that rather it would be someone who says like what we need to do is we need to figure out who the richest people in the world that own 90% of the money and then just take that money and distributed to everyone else. Like this is, there's some pretty radical arguments from Portland.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       Well, I don't think he's saying that. I say I think he equates poor with idiot. He wasn't saying, I don't want the, you know, a Bernie Sanders type. He was saying, I want, he considers like the head of Goldman Sachs to be the smartest man in the world, where there are people who, who don't seek to make that much money, who are very smart and certainly capable of doing things. I think he sees people who are not the heads of industry as being incapable of being in charge of aspects of the government. Right? Because that's his world because this world is the world of super rich people. And if you're not a super rich person, you're a loser. Well, that's the thing. It's all a winner, loser economy, which I find fascinating because he is basically calling most of the world the loser in his world. And so yeah, you could debate.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       I mean, I always think most people don't even understand most of what they talk about with politics. Like when you talk about wealth redistribution that a lot of people are fisheries, but they actually don't know anything about, uh, they have no information that the, no one's read a book about it. And it has very few, very few. I mean literally less than 1% and 1% are arguing about on a regular basis. They've seen a few clips on Fox News and they have this idea in their head of what it is exactly. And I think that's what's wrong with our country is no one knows anything about anything on either side. Like people don't know, uh, you know, deeply about, uh, the environment. There's very few people who sit down and read the study. Very few people right now are going to read that healthcare bill that is before the Senate. Right? Like how many people do you think, what percentage of the country think is going to sit down and read any part of it? Less than one 10th of 1% and destroy their lives if they get sick and they don't have coverage and who knows, maybe it's perfect and we don't understand it, but people won't bother to know anything about it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:57       Warming. Yeah. You talk to the average person on the right or the average person on the left about global warming, and you will see like it's really strange how you see these ideologically driven ideas that they have in their head about what global warming is, what causes it. And you can almost guess based on their reaction to it, whether they're republican or whether they're liberal.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Yes. And people, you know, obviously everyone talks about this, but people have chosen the side. And so now anything that that side does, people are okay with it. Yeah. And so we suddenly were so soft on Russia and then all these, you know, the being a republican used to be so about the evil empire and on a dime, it's like people like

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       Russia. Well, look what they did with Wiki leaks. Wiki leaks, everyone's turned on Wiki leaks. Wiki leaks used to be the champion of information. He's to be, these are the people that are trying to let you know all the shit that's going on behind the scenes. We're finding out all these secret emails, we're sharing them with the world. We're, we're, we're, we have a media dumped, there were dumping everything. Now it's Wiki leaks is Putin's puppet and wikileaks is working for Putin. The left is turned on. Wiki leaks was quite fascinating. Well both sides we'll switch based on what serves them in the moment. Yeah. But it's dark man. It's really weird when you see, when you see it so obvious and it's so flippant, like there's not a lot of thought put into this. Like you're talking about someone like Julian the size. I'm not a giant Julian assange fan as a human being, but I think what he's done is pretty goddamn courageous and he's taken a huge hit for it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       I mean, he's been stuck in this embassy in London forever. If he leaves, he will immediately be arrested and who knows what's going to happen to them if that happens. So this is, and this guy is still out there trying to distribute information. Well it's about is it's selective, you know, if a guy like that is just, I mean obviously the issues are, is he putting people's lives at risk with w mega dumps, which reveal sources and things like that. But also is he, is he manipulated to release things to serve a different, you know, political. Is he doing it on purpose in one way or the other? Is the stuff on the Republicans? You know, if we had all the, all the emails of the Republican's planning the trump campaign, uh, we'd have a whole nother story to tell. Now, is it impossible to get their emails?

Speaker 3:          00:37:16       Do they just have the best computers in the world and there's no way to get their emails or it depends on what the story is. Like, you know, that they believe, I mean, it's, it's so hard to figure out what happened here, but that seth rich guy, according to Kim Dotcom and according to Julian assange, he leaked, he was a Bernie Sanders supporter. He worked for the DNC. He leaked some of the information that showed that the DNC was colluding and what they were trying to do was a con. They were conspiring to keep Bernie Sanders from winning the primary. And it proved to be true that that they actually did do that. And Julian Assange, uh, was setting after that guy got shot, that somehow or another, he was alluding to that if you work with us, there are consequences. So you had someone who was a, a renegade inside the DNC who released that dump.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       You don't have anybody like that on the Republican side. It doesn't mean that the wikileaks is corrupt. It just means that no one on the republican side has done that. Only one guy, according to them, I don't know if it's true, they, some people say Russia did it, but according to Julian assange and according to Kim Dotcom was apparently somehow or another involved at least part of it had to do with this seth rich guy. That doesn't mean that they're like trying to exclusively released stuff than makes Democrats like bad. It just means no one's done it on the republican side. Just because the information doesn't exist, it doesn't mean there's some sort of collusion. Well, that's the, I guess the mystery of it. I don't even know anything about the seth rich case. What, what does that, cause I know people are mad about us.

Speaker 3:          00:38:45       That guy that was, he worked for the DNC and he was murdered outside of his apartment at four o'clock in the morning. They said it was a robbery, but he, there's a giant conspiracy theory to attach to it, but I'm just going to relay the facts. His wallet was left, his phone was left, his watch was left, his valuables, that he might have been robbed of his monies. All that stuff was there. So he's just murdered and they never found who killed him. And then immediately Julian assange was alluding to the idea that this guy was helping them and that he was murdered because that, and that has been hotly contested. And of course, uh, the Fox News narrative has like gotten, like Sean Hannity has made a big deal out of it saying that he said, we're going to get to the bottom of this, ladies and gentlemen, which makes me more suspicious and it's not true, but it is a possibility that he was one of the people that was releasing information.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       I would imagine if you worked for the DNC, especially if you were a Bernie Sanders supporter and you saw what they were doing, what they were doing is essentially they were, they were hijacking the democratic process from inside, from the Democratic Party. Yeah. And if you were a Bernie sanders supporter, it would be horrifying and it would really piss you off. And especially if you're someone who's idealistic, you've got this idea of like what the future could be under Bernie Sanders and you realize your own party is fucking him in the ass. And so, uh, I don't know how much he released or if he released or if he was only one part of it or Russia was a part of it as well. And hacking into the DNC. But the bottom line at the end of the day is it exposed corruption. I mean that's really what it was. There's absolute clear corruption in the DNC and everybody got away with it.

Speaker 3:          00:40:28       The woman who was in charge, she went and left and went immediately to work for Hillary's campaign. And you know, it's, it wasn't good stuff. It was all bad no matter what. No matter who really released it. It just showed you how gross the system is. Yeah. To the core. Yeah. All the way around. On both sides. Cause I'm not a big conspiracy theorist. I should be. But why should you be? I guess that there's always more going on than we think. But I also think that most people are too dumb to not get caught almost every single time. Yeah. You say that, but there's a lot of shit that happens where people do get caught eventually and you realize, oh, like how long were you guys running this? What's your favorite conspiracy theory that turned out to be true? It's hard to say whether it turned out to be true, but JFK is the biggest one.

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       And where did you land on that? I landed on that. It's very possible, very possible that Lee Harvey Oswald was involved. It's very possible that other people involved too. It's very possible that he shot at Kennedy and other people shot at Kennedy at the same time that and then he was a patsy and he was put like, he was obviously involved in a lot of intelligence agency shenanigans. He went to Russia, he married a Russian woman, came back to the United States. He had been involved in all sorts of communists, propaganda shit. He was definitely not like an above ground guy. He was a shady dude and it's entirely possible that he was one person out of a plot to kill the president and they put it all on him and they had Jack Ruby shoot him. But everybody goes black and white on that. You either go Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or you go, he was innocent and the CIA had him assassinated because he was trying to get rid of the CIA, which he was.

Speaker 3:          00:42:14       I mean, Kennedy was trying to pull us out of Vietnam, was trying to get rid of the CIA. He was trying to get rid of the uh, the um, uh, the, the Federal Reserve here. There was a lot of like super controversial ideas that Kennedy was trying to push forward and someone killed him. I always go to the simple thing, which is why would Jack Ruby shoot him? Right? Yeah. Cause a lot of people say, oh, he was just a patriot. We've got mad and happened to be there. But I, which maybe makes perfect sense, but if he was told to do it, it's such a suicide end up in jail for the rest of your life mission. It doesn't matter to me. It falls. Things like that fall apart there. That's what they do. But it's also possible they told him, listen, just shoot him, we'll get you off.

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll find some sort of a way. Like, or they might've had something horrible on him. Jack Ruby was clearly embedded in the mob. The mob was angry at Kennedy because they helped Kennedy when they helped him win Illinois. You know what I mean? They helped him become the president and there was absolute evidence that they were mad at him once he became president because then he started doing things that were against their interest. There was a lot of people pissed off at Kennedy. That's what's funny about the current Russia scandal because it's a similar thing where there's just so much going on. I keep saying that people, you're not hearing this defense from all the trump people. Well, we met with Peru eight times. We met with English people like they are just that having those meetings, there's not all those connections with any other country, but Russia not only that, this whole thing about Flynn and that the, the intelligence agencies were warning that Flynn was compromised and that the, he could be blackmailed by Russia. Like they had things on him, what they had on him, we don't know, but they're very convinced that there was evidence against Flynn and that the trump administration knew this and they were still entertaining talks with them. They're still bringing him on board. And what's fascinating is this world of international lobbyists, like Paul Manafort, what are they doing? Did you, did you see this a thing where Paul manafort's kids, someone hack their phones and they had all these texts where they were talking about how horrible their dad was. Oh, and how he's responsible for

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       people getting killed. Oh No. And they're seeing, and who knows if any of that's true, but there's a higher world of Americans going overseas and being involved in dirty politics and the work of, uh, governments like the Ukraine that we don't have any clue about what that is. Yeah. It's on the last frontiers for really diabolical shit. You know, like Russia is one of the last, like what he had, what he is, what Putin stands for is, uh, like one of the last brutal military dictators. It's kind of in a costume. Yes, he's in a costume as the president of Russia, but we all know, like, he murders people that oppose him. He murders journalists, he murders political candidates that are running against him. I mean, he's, he's terrifying guy. But what do you think it means that that trump just love some just not good.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       He just, he did Myers. I think he admires the take no shit guy. Yeah, I think he does and I think there's also the possibility that he feels that what Putin stands for is like he's a this powerful superpower and it's better to be friends with them than it is to be enemies. Let's just cozy up, hey, I wish I could do a lot of the shit you do. A lot of people talk shit about me on twitter. I wish I could have him killed. I mean it's entirely possible that he thinks along those lines because I think it's probably from decades of trump dealing with the mob in New York and Atlantic city and he probably developed a point of view about how you deal with evil people. Yeah. And how you have to make deals and how friends with them. I think a lot of rich people think everyone doesn't understand this is how the world works.

Speaker 2:          00:46:17       This is how the sausage gets made and that's why they do crazy stuff because they just go, everyone else is naive and just get me in a room with and get me a back channel. We'll figure it out. Like right. The back channel with cushner, it's like sitting down with a mob figuring out your price for cement. That's what he thinks the Putin back channel is. I believe we will figure it out. We'll, we'll, we'll come up with, and I think it seems like trump likes the idea of that what you present is a lie and what you do in private is figuring out solutions and that that's how the world works and that it's all full of shit. Yeah, and that that is the way you get away with everything. That's how the world works. That's a justification. Hey, it's how the world works, which is so different than Bush who was religious and had this thought, we are going to go to other countries.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       We're going to take down these leaders and they are going to find freedom and we're all going to change for the positive when they don't have these dictators. Trump is an old school guy who's like, you need the dictators to keep all these assholes in line. Yeah. But meanwhile he's kind of right. I mean, look what happens when you take the dictators out. You create this power vacuum and the places are way more chaotic. Look at Libya, right? It's a failed state now. He got rid of Qaddafi. Everybody's happy. Hillary Clinton was on TV. They did an interview with her where she's cheering. She's like laughing at a week came, we saw he died. Ha Ha. Do you see that? Oh yes. The air thing. I think that's what makes the world so impossible to manage right now. Right. Which is, you know, it's like, we tried this, this, you know, this approach of let's, let's make these people a democracy, but you can't force people to want a democracy.

Speaker 2:          00:48:09       Also, they're conditioned to being in a dictatorship. They've lived that way their whole life, and there's all these other people. When you get rid of Qaddafi, it doesn't mean he's the only piece of shit there. There's a million other pieces of shit that are wondering how they get to that guy's position and he's keeping them down and murdering people and trying to keep keeping. And so their entire life, that's the paradigm they've operated under. They've watched this happen, they've seen this one central brutal, murderous figure control everyone else. And when that's gone, it's not all Kumbaya. All the sudden it creates this power vacuum and then everybody's clamoring to see who takes that guy spot. And now you have isis steps in and Libya is just straight chaos. And there's seems to be no solution to almost no solution, right? Because there's a, there's a massive religious tribal war happening where if we, if we didn't exist, they were, they would just be fighting each other.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       Right? And that's what happened. That's what we were warned about with Iraq. Like people that didn't understand Iraq, including Bush, did not understand. If you take Saddam Hussein out of the picture, who is kind of secular, what you're left with is this Sunni Shia up civil war. And you're going to have this crazy situation where there's two different sects of Islam are going to kill each other and no one saw that coming. I mean, well you know who did see that coming? Janeane Garofalo she, yeah, cause I remember watching her on CNN and there was a, there was a massive protest against going into Iraq before we went to war. And she said, this is what's going to happen if we go there. And she laid that out. Well, she's a Noam Chomsky Fan. Yeah. She said, these people are going to attack each other. We're going to create a mess.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       That is going to be, we're gonna open a Pandora's box and there are no weapons of mass destruction and we should wait and we don't have enough information. And she really took a beating, uh, for being, uh, in strong opposition to invading Iraq. And every single thing that you said would happen in the next 10 years. It happened. And she wasn't the only person. There were plenty of people. I remember when nine 11 happened, Norman mailer was on, uh, he was on Charlie rose like that week. And he said, this is exactly what's going to happen. And he explained the wars that would happen, where they would happen. He, and then he, and this is what's gonna happen

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       as a result of those wars and, and laid out the mess that was created. And he said, you'll see, we, we do not have the strength to not take these steps. I should clarify. I don't know if Janine's uh, uh, really, uh, Noam Chomsky Fan, but I know chumps Chomsky was saying that like, he was pretty adamant about that. Like very early on, I just watched the Chomsky documentary on Netflix. It's an interesting guy. Yeah. And it was fascinating and it had one simple idea, which also I think a lot of people don't realize, uh, which is just that our country, how it's set up is, is meant to protect people from the people with money from the land owners. As it was more back then. And the basic theory is that the people with the wealth and corporations are not served by democracy. If democracy is functioning, it is not in the favor of the wealthy or corporate interests.

Speaker 1:          00:51:31       And so as a result, they always have to be against democracy because if they're, if, if Republicans don't have voter suppression, then everything is going to change in favor of what the population wants to do. So that they'll always be incentives for having less people vote and to, to making democracy not function the way that it should. Cause clearly you could have voter motor id where the, when you get your driver's license, you're registered for the whole country. You could have everyone in the country vote by mail, you can have everyone vote by computer, you can make it. So we'd have 80, 90% of the people voting. But that goes against corporate interests. And so they fight to say, uh, there's, you know, all these fake votes when there, there isn't. And so that protects corporate interests. And it's a, it's a really interesting documentary that just came up I guess in the last year.

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       What's it called? Um, oh, we're about to find out. It's, I see. I liked it. The computers to searching as we speak. A lot of people that are resisting the idea of people voting online. But we bank online. It's ridiculous. Of course she'd be able to vote while we certainly could get more people voting. It's fascinating that there's other countries like Russia trying to get into that. Oh, requiem for the American dream. Uh, yeah. It's, it's worth it. It's worth seeing. I mean, I, I don't really, you know, some of these things I don't have the strongest opinions on because it's pretty, it's very complicated and it's like you said, you just, you never know what new, messier creating. I was talking to this actor, right? Um, who does a lot of charity work around the world, very famous actor. And he said, you know, I was working, uh, on this project to dig wells and a community in Africa. And then we dug the wells and his incredible for this community and

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       then the neighboring community came and murdered everybody for the wells. He goes, that's what it's like trying to save people and to help people in the world. There's always something that results that you did not anticipate that makes it even more complicated. And I feel it's that way with most issues that you think it's this, but you've set off that and uh, and it takes, I would, where I come down is you need an incredibly intelligent person to be in the middle of making these choices. And just generally with trump, I don't think he's that smart and I think that he is very, you know, very self-involved, narcissistic person and we can debate, uh, choices, but it doesn't seem like the, like the person who has the depth to make these calls. Well, I don't think anybody really is qualified to run 350 million people. I just think it's a ridiculous proposition, but I think you're definitely right.

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       Also, he, he sets the tone for the mindset of the country. Yeah. I mean it really is. We have this Alpha male chimpanzee thing going on where the one like robot Momma love him or hate him, was a very articulate, really well spoken calm and measured guy. And I think that's very good for America to have this guy who's smarter than anybody you know, and he's running the country like you feel like, okay, well this guy is obviously, look, he, he hardly ever stutters. He knows what he's talking about. And very moderate. I mean, when you get down to it, what I find interesting is Obama was so moderate after the banking issues, he didn't go after the bankers. He didn't send anyone to jail. He propped up those businesses. So the fact that the banks so want to get rid of him, it makes me go how much money is enough, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:20       This guy's still basically on your side. Hillary's basically still on your side. They were mad when their bonuses where minimalized. Yeah, remember that. Exactly. I think that they got billions of dollars in bail money and they still wanted their bonuses. I have a contract, my contract says I got a bonus or just thinking about their house and their yacht and people got bonuses even though the economy collapsed, even though the economy class as a direct result of the industry that they were involved in and the businesses they were running, they still got bonuses. It's really crazy and it was interesting is that I guess most people, they don't connect that and they're not furious. Like right now they're trying to get rid of the compute, the Consumer Protection Bureau that keeps an eye on the bank. So they're trying to Defang them. And Pete, you would think that people who want their guns would also say, but I would like consumer protection so you don't screw me out of my credit card. Right. But for some reason, because it doesn't align it with their team. Exactly. They don't care about the issues that are, that would protect them. Isn't that super dangerous to have a right and a left I, it's just

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       cause you always do, you go for independent candidates a lot. Right. You're looking for a third party and what prevents there from being a logical third party? Well, I think we had it with Ross Perot, right? I think Ross Perot was a logical third party and it became very dangerous for people. And that's one of the reasons why the commission for presidential debates changed the threshold. Like you back then, you needed 5% in the primary in order to be included in the debates. You put Ross Perot and the debate is an, uh, an independent [inaudible] extremely wealthy man who understands a lot about tax codes, understands a lot about foreign relations, and he became like a huge problem and most likely cost. Uh, Herbert Walker Bush his second term, right? Yes. And then that's why Clinton became president in the first place. And the threshold is what now to get into those debates, Bernie Sanders is kind of an independent, right?

Speaker 3:          00:57:12       I mean, he's obviously that his parties not on his side, and we proved that with the DNC leaks that they're, they're conspiring against him. This is his actual own party, which is the same as changing the thresholds of the third party candidate. Can't be in the debates. Right, right. It's just another version of that. Exactly. Yeah. It's another version of that. Well then you find out the condition for presidential debates is I, it's, it's not even a national thing. It's like a privately funded thing. It's a, it's a private company. Like they can choose like how they like what like, oh, let's make it 15%. You have to get 15% and then they could just change it. Like that guy was a problem. That guy was a pain in the ass. Let's change the threshold. Yeah. What could go wrong? Yeah. Are you, I mean there are people who feel like left and right are the same thing when you really get down to it or they're protecting the same interests in some way.

Speaker 3:          00:58:08       Are you a believer in that or not? I think that the, most of the people that are on the left and most of the people on the right aren't even really thinking about whatever their party stands for. They are just like they said, they are sticking with the team, whether it's the left team, have the right team. I think, um, I think radical ideologies, whether it's on the left or the right, will they share a lot of common traits. And one of the things that they share is the, this complete lack of objectivity, lack of objectivity and lack of introspective thought in terms of like what their party is actually doing and what it means to be a liberal, what it means to be progressive, what it means to be Republican, what it means to be conservative. You just get into this groove like this is what we do, fuck global warming.

Speaker 3:          00:58:50       It's not real. You know, and then fuck this and you can't be racist against a white person. Like you. People have these ridiculous ideas on the left and on the right. They just dig their heels in the sand. They didn't even think about and they just go with it because that's what the party says. And it's just the game because they have kind of election night, I called a lot of politicians and a bunch of journalists was just trying to get a sense of what's going on. How could I get involved with was there to do. And it was really dispiriting. It was all reactive. Everyone was like, well, we have to see what they do to decide how to react. And I

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       was like, so you were just super upset that trump won? Yeah, I could see what was about to happen. And everything I was concerned about did happen. But they basically all said, well, you have to let him do his thing to then react and then have the population react to what he did. And did you have any concerns at all about hillary? Well, I, I think, uh, it reminded me a little bit of a, I mean, I'm aware of what those issues are, but I do think, you know, there are large choices that just affect millions and hundreds of millions of people. Like for instance, when a guy like Donald Trump says, we're not going to give money to any aid service around the world that says anything about abortion, forget giving out abortions. If they hand out a pamphlet and it says that's an option, they don't get money.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       So if you're a country in Africa and there's only one aids aid service, I like feeds starving people. But you also hand out a pamphlet on abortion. You don't get any of the money anymore. I agree. That was fucked up and a lot of the things he does are fucked up. But did you have any problems at all with Hillary? Like did you know I had a big issue that she does not seem to understand a certain issues like the speech getting paid for the speeches that, that her blind spot and she has revealed to still have it after the election that like, uh, why did I go there? Cause I got paid, uh, you know, I guess they've made, you know, over a hundred million dollars giving speeches bill and Hillary Clinton, which on one level you go, yeah, you know, people don't understand. I'm going to go do a, a standard corporate gig and it's crazy money.

Speaker 1:          01:01:00       There's a crazy corporate speech money floating up. Yeah, but wait a minute. No, no, no, no. I'm not defending it yet. I'm just saying she has a blind spot to what? To the potential for corruption that people see in that and that she, when you're, when you're getting, I mean, well one article said it was like $150 billion between the two of them over like 10 years or so. The fact that she doesn't even have a good game to, to defend it, that you can't go up against trump and say he's corrupt while you're getting that much money from corporate interests. Like she never even saw how offensive it was. That kind of thing that Bernie Sanders doesn't do. So people go, well, at least he's not lining his pockets with that money. Hillary is basically saying, I, I lined my pockets with that money, but I still have my own opinions and the blind spot at least to the outrage of it is something that I, I had threw me. But ultimately the main choices that she wanted to make on a lot of issues are so much more in line with what I believe than trump. That, although not a perfect candidate, you know, trump is doing, you know, he's, he's trying to get this healthcare thing through and doesn't seem

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       that concerned about the amount of people are you get kicked off. So I, I guess there are certain things I sucked up about it. I didn't have a core thing that she's like a terrible person, but I think it, it's, it's pretty hard to get me to that place with people. I always need a little bit more proof of that. But certainly she represents someone who is dishonest though. And that's a real problem when you don't have a leader of this incredible country and someone who's clearly dishonest and it's been dishonest for a long time. Like when they talk to her about the emails, every interview she gave about it, she would give varying responses. A lot of them were dishonest. A lot of it was not based on facts when she compared what she said Komi said to her during the investigation versus what Comi was saying publicly, they were totally different things.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       Oh, I, I totally understand it. I think that there's a lot of politics that's really bad and really dirty and I don't know enough on each specific thing that have a, you know, a position on each thing that she said. But I do feel like there are people who are playing the game with service in mind and maybe they're getting dirty or making mistakes with service in mind. And then there are people like trump that I really don't understand why he's there. And His general philosophy is let the smart rich people get richer and something nice might happen for you that he's so dishonest on a level that you can't compare it to. It's just so, I mean he admits that he's a liar. Uh, no, I'm fully with you on this. But whenever people criticize trump or whenever the people talk about Hillary rather the f one of the first things they do is say trump is worse.

Speaker 2:          01:03:58       They, instead of like talking about how weird like, oh, she's such an non ideal candidate. Like she was such a terrible candidate. She didn't believe in gay marriage until 2013 you mean 2013 she was publicly stating that gay marriage should be, it should not be legal, that a marriage, a legal marriage should be between a man and a woman. And clearly for only political reasons, like she obviously had exact issue with it at all. And I agree with you, I feel like there is a part of politics where people, you know, like say my position was evolving on that one. No, your position wasn't evolving. You just weren't fighting for what you actually believe. Obama took a while to make big moves on that. But I still think at core people like that are trying to figure out the system to help people. And I can't say I understand what trump has in this for other than to be considered the greatest winner of all time. Yeah, I think that's probably exactly it. I don't think he really wanted to be president. I think he was doing it sort of boost his brand and along the way he lost the television show right when he's doing all that, build that wall shit. And, but running the wall just got 10 feet higher and NBC was like, Fuck you man, we're canceling your show. And when they did that, I think he was like, Oh yeah, well I'm really going to be fucking president. And he kept going

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       and going and going and then he won. I mean it seems to me like the whole thing was started almost as a publicity campaign, like a fun thing. What if his people said that there was a woman in publicity for him who left? She's the only person I knew who left the campaign for this reason, I forgot her name, but it was very public. This wasn't a it. She said it publicly that when it started, the plan was to come in second to help the brand, to get some fame, to make some statements about what he believes with no belief that it was possible that he would do better than second in the Republican primaries. And then the woman said as it became clear that they had a really good shot of winning. She said, oh, I wasn't in it for this. And what I find fascinating to watch is trump's slowly getting comfortable with power as as he thinks he's figuring it out is interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       Like, uh, I mean even the Jerrod cushner thing is kind of hilarious. You have this son in law, so now you have a blind spot that anyone in the world thinks it's weird that you give your son in law are real estate developers so much power and he doesn't care at all because he doesn't trust anybody except like four people. So he's got to give them all the power, but he puts them in charge of fixing everything wrong with the infrastructure of governments and the Middle East and two or three other things. And trump doesn't understand how insane that appears. And also how each task is impossible. Like this is my son when he's going to fix government and the Middle East, the type of guy that doesn't realize, well maybe there's one person for each of those jobs is, that's where I just go, oh, he's full out crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Because who would even do that to their son in law? Maybe his son in law is a pain in the ass. He's like, this fucking kid thinks he could do things. All right, I'll give you the worst job ever. Go fix government. Go fix the Middle East. I got it. I'm going to prove my worth to you sir. And Ray Ban Sunglasses and his preppy outfit. I mean it, it's become so comical. You know, it's a fascinating thing because it's both terrifying and comical. Like if this was a movie, it's too broad and you wouldn't believe it. You would just go to much. It's happening in every scene. Too many crazy thoughts and what I guess, I guess what I wonder, I mean maybe you have an opinion about this. There are people who say, you know, it is the destruction of truth when you just make these lies up all day long, that you changed the definition of truth or even people's ability to decide what they think is the truth. Is that a philosophy that someone like bannon is executing in the White House or something that happens randomly and, and, and is organic out of them? That's a real good question. I mean, there's always the concept. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       And knowing that you're in some sort of a competition, knowing that you are, uh, there's people trying to knock you down and you're in this position of power and you're shoring up your defenses. And I think there's a lot of weird stuff that goes on whenever you're the winning team and you realize you're being attacked at all angles by this other team. And then you've got this guy who's the head guys, a fucking maniac. He's got fake hair. He puts a spray Tan on every day. He's out there as his eyes are white. No one tells him his face, his orange. He's saying insane shit. He contradicts himself all the time. He lies all the time about numbers. He's always bragging about how well his ratings are and how shows do really well because everybody knows he watches the show. It's crazy stuff that you just don't expect from someone who's in the position of president of the United States.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       I think almost all bets are off at this point. That's the one thing that I find promising about this, that people are so upset by how fucked up this it is. This is that they're going to get politically active and that they're going to realize like there's some real holes in the system, like the FBI, like the president shouldn't just be able to fire the head of the FBI because you don't like the investigation like of yourself sane and, and, and sessions recused himself, but he can fire the guy investigating himself. Insane. It's all insane. But I, I guess what my fear would be is that when it just swings back the other way, like you could just swing left, right, right, right. But are any institutional protections that were put in place because it just swings back up. But like for instance say like we don't, you know, I'm not an expert in healthcare, but let's assume it's just a shit storm.

Speaker 3:          01:10:03       Right? And in, in a year or two, whatever millions of people are losing the healthcare and everyday you're just hanging about hundreds of people who have cancer who can't pay for their medicine. What happens in this country? Do People get mad at the Republicans? Did they vote them out or to somehow not enough sick people? There's not enough sick people to make the change. I think there's so many issues. There's so many issues that like where do you draw the line? Do you draw the line at them? Taking the teeth out of the EPA, which is what they're done. Environmental Protection Agency is fucked now. I mean they were moving the satellites that track global warming, they're, they're, they're, they're stopping funding for all these different initiatives and all these different programs and all these different studies. They're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on at the plant. They were like that, that the stop all that. What we really need is Enron and Exxon, all these different companies, big conglomerates, big corporations. We need to drill, we need to drill, we need to frack, we need to go over where, you know, Alaska and we're in the Antarctic. We get in that ground, pull that oil out and, and it's, it's, that's, that's scary. And then you hear the healthcare shit. Well, well that's scary too. And then you hear the Russian shit. Well that's scary.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       North Korea. Oh, that's scary. There's so many different things to be scared about. I don't think the people who don't have cancer don't have diseases are really considering all this healthcare stuff. I think it's one of those things that happens. Once you have a health issue, then you realize how fuck the system is and especially if you don't have the money to take care of it, you're like, wow, like our medical system in this country is not, it's not the best. We have the best doctors. We certainly have the best surgeons and we have some pretty amazing innovative medicine. But when it comes to like the, the system itself for like when you find out how much people have to pay when they go to the doctor and how about you eve, you have insurance but the insurance only covers so much. You still have to pay more.

Speaker 2:          01:11:54       Sure. By, by my mom died of ovarian cancer. And I just remember going through those bills and there was a lot of experimental medicine that potentially could save her. And you didn't know if insurance would say this is the type of approach that they are willing to pay for. Right. And anything you needed to do, you'd have to prove you needed it. Someone says you needed a new cat scan and you've had to that ear, you might have to go to a war to say why you need it now. Right. And uh, I remember crunchers, I'm just always fascinated that it doesn't line up for people. Like you say you love the outdoors and you love hunting. Well don't you love the environment, right? And so why are you not really pissed or trumps going to build a wall and he's going to take a lot of people's land away to build the wall?

Speaker 2:          01:12:44       Well, I thought that was the big issue for all of these militia groups don't mess with our land. Yeah. And so there's always going to do is going to take land away to build the wall. The only way to build the wall in a lot of those plots of land, a lot of private lands. I mean it's a, it's a, that's a jagged path when you're building that wall and you have to, you know, you have to take away a lot of people's lands to pull that off. Uh, so that's what scares me the most about America's. There's an ilogic to people's opinions. I think there's too many variables. I think there's too many things to, for people to consider. And I think people work all day and then they have hobbies and families and things they enjoy doing and they don't have the time to really sit.

Speaker 2:          01:13:24       I mean each one of those issues would require a full time job all day long investigating, exacerbating it, discussing it, whether it's Flynn's ties to Russia or what session knows and how many times did he speak to the Russians or what did, what did jared cushner actually do in the Middle East? Like what is he doing in the overlap? Cause each one of those is a full time job. What does he sing to Netanyahu alone in the room. How do they let him do that? He looks like such a Dork. Did you see the pictures of him with a bulletproof vest on overseas? And he's hanging around with the actual soldiers and he's sitting there with his ray bans on masking tape with his name magic markered on it. And it's, it's a comedy. And I have to say as a creative person who's going to be at the Wilbur Oh, uh, when, when he to go, what am I get the Wilbur, this is called the mid show.

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       A plug. Everybody, uh, the Wilburn Boston, uh, just added a late show for charity for the afterschool programs for Boston Arts, July 24th, the wilbur.com. One of my favorite theaters in the warpath and the best crowds. Amazing. It's incredible. And it feels like you're in a club. There's a thousand people in there, but they're all in three tiers. Yeah. And so it's very short. It's like three, 300 seat comedy clubs jammed in there together. It's the perfect layout for common. It really is. And then I'll be in a providence, Rhode Island at the Columbus Theater. Uh, July 25th and at the Richfield playhouse in Ridgefield, Connecticut. July 23rd and I'm taping my special Ed Montreal, the just for laughs festival because they seem to be amused by me then. Oh, that's an amazing place to do it at the festival and the festival. Yeah. How many shows are you going to do? I'm doing five shows.

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       I'm taping four of them. Oh, that's a good move. I like that. I like when I hear that. I hate when I hear someone taping one show. No, no. I, I could panic and ruin one show. I can, I can actually, if I did only two shifts, I can panic the first show and then go, okay, now I only have one show to get it and panic again. Who are you doing your special for? Uh, for Netflix. Oh yeah. That's the way to go. It was my turn. Nice. And so I haven't done something like that since. Basically the HBO Young Comedian Special in 1992 with the Ray Romano, the guy who got fired. So you could have your career. No, I didn't. He got fired. So somebody else could take it. And then that guy fired and I got two kids. I don't know who is the in between.

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       Guy was on the pilot, there was a guy on the pilot that was not ray ray got fired and another guy took his spot and then that guy fired and I took that guy spot. I'll Paul Simms is vicious. Vicious. He was going to get it done right around a little bit of in the news radio days just as a friend of Paul's and Andy Dicks. And that show is a show that holds up and is really funny. Well I was just happy that there was a buffer between me and rang cause I love Ray. I would not have wanted to be the guy that takes Ray's job. I think ray is one of the first people to tell you he probably was not prepared as an actor at that exact moment. What was the wrong gig forum? Everybody loves Raymond was the perfect gay. Yes. Let him write for himself and let him figure it all out and become obsessed with it.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       He's such a good guy. Oh, he's the best. Ray Romano was like one of the nicest people I've ever met. And so good in our movie. The big sick. Honestly, the dream part. So funny. So real, very, I mean it's the culmination of everything he's learned as an actor and a, and a and a person. Uh, so I'm very excited about that. Just doing that tbs things doing like a drama for awhile yet men of a certain age depress dudes. That's what I called it, a bunch of depressed dudes. I called it the Judd apatow story and yeah, he's, he's so, he's so good. He was on parenthood for awhile. Um, and I've gotten to spend a little time with him because of this movie, but it is funny that we were on the young comedian special in 1992. That is amazing. And now you're back at it and now and now I'm back doing it again.

Speaker 2:          01:17:17       You've done stand up now for three years since yeah. Since uh, 2000 for three years straight. Yeah. And then like what, like how many years in where you like, I think I've got a special here. They asked me to do it a year ago and I said, okay, give me one more year. So that's very honest of you. Well, you know, everybody's so good. I mean, I was performing the other night and the original room and you were in the main room and I could hear the place rocking from the stage of the original room. Maybe bike ride was too quiet that I could hear you. I could hear your last and you just, you know, talking loud and I, and so I always think, wow, people are so good right now. People, people are masters at this and I can't be mediocre at it. I mean, I'm in the same business as you and Maria Bamford and Louis Ck and Hannibal and I have to be able to be proud of what I'm doing.

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       So Joey Diaz and bill bird, this is a different time or so many murderers out there right now. Yeah, I mean I was watching Burr, I did a largo show that he was on and I was just watching him from the side of the stage and just his level of intensity is so, you know, in a weird way it's so professional and I notice it with you the other night too that you could get yourself in that state where you care so much and you're so passionate and it requires so much energy and focus to get to that place, to perform with that passion. It's just really impressive cause like for me I can just get tired and starts tearing a night. How did it get tired? Halfway through like, oh like it's just felt a wave of like, like after you eat a big meal and you just get tired, like it just hit you eight minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:18:59       What I'm always trying to accomplish is trying to get out whatever I'm trying to talk about with the most power that I can like the most. Like what's the best way to do it is the best way to do it. Slow and calm and let people soak in the idea or is the best way to do it to be intense and like what is like the most entertaining way that I would be engaging this material, figure whatever that is and and fuck with it and moving around and bring it up and bring it down. And that's one of the things where the store is such a great place to focus on that kind of stuff because there's so many killers because of the standards are so high that you have to really, you really have to be on point and it's packed every night you go to the comedy. So the main room would use it as be desolate like four years ago. It's sold out like it's vegas every night. Every night I walk in there like I got some new jokes. I'm like, can I do, how many new jokes can I do when this is a big sold out excited crowd, which changed the face of comedy in La. Now, I mean comedy in La is a different thing now. The last few years. It's also funny how a place like the comedy store, you know our friend Adam, uh, he got

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       who who books it. Just one guy with good tastes booking the club well and suddenly everyone in town wants to run to that club. Again, both comedians and the audience because Adam does such a good job looking at opening up that back bar where you gave us a place where the public can't go on a comics can go and hang out. That was giant where there was a place to chill and hang out. People with like you'd be sitting there with Ron Wyden, allow, I'm on in five c your boys and he'd go out there and do a set. Then Diaz would come back and all these different people are hanging out there. You're like, wow, like this place is like something special. Like they, they made changes, they figured things out, they did things differently. Yeah. I missed just hanging out with comics when I wasn't doing stand up.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       I was like, I don't know anybody anymore. Like, I literally don't know anybody that just the idea of being a part of that community and it is a community of people that are really smart, you know, really, really funny. And I think generally incredibly supportive community to each other. Yes. Yeah. Well I think especially now there's so many opportunities I don't think people feel like is starved. I think there was a famine mentality that was going on way back in the day when it was everybody competing for tonight show spots and then every now and then someone got an hbo special and it was Holy Shit there was not that many hbo specials. But other than that you had to do talk shows and you had to do like a few minutes on a talk show or you know, maybe you were like a Richard Jenny who thrived in that format and you could do 30 tonight show things and then fill up arenas because of that.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       But for most people it was a scratch and claw environment and people were fighting to try to get a sitcom and fighting to try to get movie roles and all these, there was not a lot. But now because of the Internet, because of Youtube, because of social media and then a Netflix, which was giant, there's so much opportunity like, and the comedians have also found way more of an audience. There's way more audience out there because people realize like, Oh look, Sarah Silverman has a new netflix special. Oh look, Jim Jefferies has a new netflix special. I'll look bill burroughs and who? Netflix special. And just keeps going and going and going and going and going. It's like, it's almost unstoppable. And I remember when I was a kid, there was nothing. It was just like Robert Klein would have a special every couple of years now. And then George Carlin every couple of years, they didn't give the hours too many people.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       And there were so many people that probably could have done a netflix special back then. Sure. And they didn't have the audience. They never got the shot. And, you know, they just sort of stayed at a certain state in their career forever. Yeah. You know, it's just, this is an amazing, amazing time for it. Yeah. And it's good. I mean, I watch people, I'm like, God damn, that's, people are fucking great. I mean, I'd really like watch people. I was watching Ray Romano the other night, his act was just monstrous. Yeah. He was so strong. Have you seen the Andrew Santina at the store? Oh yeah. Fine. Let's go. I'm going to end up here. I mean, it's so good. I, it's uh, it's exciting. I can't think about it too much because sometimes I think there's so many people why do it? But I'm trying to

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       make it very much about the audience and me and that, you know, because I make movies and do tv that my standup career really is just about getting to hang out with everybody and my relationship with that particular crowd that night. Like I don't need it to pay the rent, so I could do it from a very pure place cause it's just about these interactions. That's great. You know? And so, and it frees me up to not be nervous and then I can be a little more daring because it's not going to going to sink me if anything goes wrong. Do you think that it enhances your ability to make movies? Does it enhance your perspective? Oh yeah. It's a funny, I think that when you don't talk directly to the crowd, you get stale as to what people are thinking about. You know, I can tell, I don't know, just when I bring up certain topics, just what people's concerns are and it happens unconsciously.

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       Oh, this is what people find funny these days. This is what people are freaking out about. This is what people are happy about. And when you don't do it, you're just alone in a room with your editor. You're just sitting in it with you sitting with one dude for two years. And I think, uh, I also think you're connecting to some, you know, whatever, your, your, your, the creativity of the universe because you're in spaces with a lot of people, with a lot of other creative people and you're hooking into creativity on some level. I've always wondered how comedy writers who don't do standup can do it. I've always wondered like, how do they know? It's funny like how do they know what's what they're guessing? Well, it's weird to write jokes, make a movie, and then two years later find out if they're funny. That's our, that's why people say, Oh, why do you have so much improv?

Speaker 1:          01:24:44       Because I don't want to be in an editing room. Put in the joke. I wrote realize it sucks and then go, do we have any other jokes? And the editor Says No. Ooh. So I always want like I it with any scene, I always go, well that's where the joke supposed to be. Here's my favorite, let's get eight more and low and then we'll move on. I never think like when there's people like the Coen brothers and it's verbatim, you can't change a comma when they shoot it. Is that what is good? What is with them? It's like a play and I respect it, but I do not have the courage to assume when I hit editing that I am such a genius that I will not have fucked up any of this in the writing. They have a weird kind of comedy though. They're comedy is so quirky and fascinating, like, and I guess maybe it's just that, that purity of vision that they have.

Speaker 1:          01:25:33       Sure. And sticking to that script. And a lot of people do that. I mean, uh, no, a bomb back does that and you know, you can't change any of it. But I always think, I don't know if, uh, if an actor's a said Ray Romano was on the set of the big sick and he's talking about his feelings and he has the scene, if I go, uh, you know, uh, you know, Michael Showalter, director of that movie, Hey, let, let them do another one. Let's just let him change it this, but tell him to hit the same idea. Right. Half the time he beats the joke at the time. Yeah. If you have the right cast, well

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       that was what sims did on Newsradio. He led everybody just come up with better lines. It was a big part of why the show works so well. It's like we all felt really invested in the creative process and that's so rare and that's, I remember it was shandling would do that on a [inaudible] should. They would rehearse for several days and in that rehearsal people were allowed to screw around and if something good came up, Gary would would write it down. And Hartman was the funniest. Phil Hartman really was, you know, when you really make the list of the funniest people of all time, he's just so high up on that list. It was a remarkable thing. I would go to tapings of that show and SNL tapings and at one point I was talking about writing an Hbo special with him and I don't know if there's ever been anyone more challenge in more ways than him now.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       He was brilliant. He did. He really was incredibly disciplined to why when I was on the set with them, he was becoming a pilot and so he was a, in the middle of scenes he would be reading flight books and reading books on aviation and, and writing notes and taking notes. His, he was so organized like his scripts, he would put them all in a binder, he would take the script immediately. You put three punch, put it in a binder and he would have tabs for each of his scenes and each tab had a different color. This is scene one, scene two. And he would have everything set up like that and have this line's highlighted and he would practice them and have them down to like a razor sharp. Yeah, it was amazing. He was a really, really, really interesting guy. A very unique, I don't think I've ever met anybody like him because he also came out of, uh, he was a designer and scientist.

Speaker 2:          01:27:44       Yeah. Did album covers and stuff. And, and he said that he got Saturday night live because he went in for the audition and he was retiring because his career hadn't worked out the way he wanted it to. And then someone said, do you want to go in for snl? And he was so ready to be done that he had an amazing audition cause he assumed he wouldn't get it. And basically it was like, fuck this business. And then that's the moment when he was in his purest funny itself and just got it. Oh, interesting guy, man. He was blackmailed while we were on the show. And a while we're on the show, he and his wife actually had went to a strip club and this was like 1997, 97, 98, somewhere around there. So, uh, this some asshole at a strip club, got a video camera, brought in a video camera and filmed like a fucking video camera back then. And he filmed phil and his wife at a strip club laughing, just having a couple of drinks. And I think phil got a lap dance and his wife got a lap dance and then they laugh and he this guy, um, put a copy of this video tape in an envelope and nailed it to Phil's garage door. Oh fuck. With a note saying, cause I had Herman's thing. It was scary shit. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       but it was different because Letterman, his thing was someone he knew. And this was not a guy I knew and this is the guy who found out where Phil lived and said, I'm going to get this to uh, all of the advertisers that you know, you do commercials with and all the people that you do films with and I'm going to ruin your career unless you give me money. Call me at this number that I left his fucking number. So Phil calls the Guy Records the thing and we did it in the room with me and he goes, I'm going to call the guy now. I'm gonna call the guy now we shut. And he goes, hey buddy, what's going on? Listen, I understand what you're saying, but you got to realize like, I don't have as much money as you think I do. And I mean this is coming.

Speaker 3:          01:29:40       I don't want the tape getting out. But I mean you're making it out like it's a bigger deal than it is. And the guy was like, look, I'm, I'm telling you and this that, and the guy was like, look, I'm willing to work with you. Let's just come to a reasonable reasonable number. So they come to this reasonable number in this whole time where he's doing this, he's recording this and he gets it to this private investigator guy and then this asshole meets the private investigator thinking he's going to meet Phil and get paid. And this private investigator guy scares that fucking shit out of him and threatens his life and you know, takes his wallet from him, takes photos of his, you know, his address and you know, basically says, don't ever contact him again or your life will radically change in a horrible way.

Speaker 3:          01:30:22       And the guy disappeared. But it was weird to be in the room with them and feels like close to dark too. I'm going to call him. I was like wiping his hands. Sounds like an Anthony Pelicano special. Uh, exactly what we're talking about. Yeah, that's exactly what we're talking about. That's a, that's a ray Donovan Shit. Yeah, it's Ray Donovan Shit. It was weird. It was weird to be there for that to see like it is also to see like that someone would like try to weasel in on them. Phil was just such a nice guy. Just he knew this dude that was like a carpenter. The guy did some work with them. The guy called him out of this halt, call them horrible sob story. You know, we're going to lose our house and this and that and I just, you know, just give me a little bit of a loan.

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       Okay. So Phil gives them like $25,000 just gives this guy and then the guy calls him three months later and he asked for another 30 and that feels like, what the fuck man, you know, like he was just almost too nice. That's about how it usually goes with that. It is, yeah. You never lend someone money and then they go, you know what? You solved all my problems and now I'm fine and here's the money back. It just anybody money. Oh yeah, yeah. Did anybody ever pay you back? Yes. I always to tell this story just because it's funny. My friend Dave Raff who manages Pete Holmes at some point was like transitioning and starting his own management company and asked me for some money. Not much, but the only guy who ever paid me back and quickly. Yeah, and that makes sense. And it is a great man and is producing my netflix special. Ah, well that works. But the only guy to ever do what he said he was going to do. Yeah. It's always these people that, dude,

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       once this happens and this is going to happen and I'm going to be making this amount of money and don't worry about it, it's all going to come, but just need a little right now. It never happened. Someone said the second people ask for money, they resent you. And so even if you give people money, they're mad that they had to ask and they kind of hate you because you had to ask you, Ooh, that's interesting. Which, which I, which is certainly what you feel. Well, there's also the people that think that the way to make it is to get somebody else to get you through. Like you gotta you gotta call on favors, you gotta, you gotta have connections. You've got to get your way through that way that that's the way to do it. Somebody gave you a break, man. He didn't give me a break.

Speaker 1:          01:32:42       Somebody gave you a break. It's like, it's just, that mentality is so wrong. Oh yeah. I mean, one thing I'm proud of in my career is they really was. I had no ins at all. You know, I just, you know, my parents got divorced. They were both bankrupt. I started interviewing comedians from my high school radio station at some point I got Jamie Masada from the laugh factory, the who owns the laugh factory. He had a magazine in the 80s and he printed an interview I did with David Brenner. And I think I did another one with Henny youngman. Then when I moved here in [inaudible] 85, uh, I tried to get spots of this laugh factory and it was still hard to get up there, but I didn't know anybody. And the person who really hooked me up with Sammy shore, wow. Same Insurance, started the comedy store it, then he got divorced and Mitzi took it over and made it the great place it is.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       But he started a comedy room in Marina del Ray called Sammie's by the shore in the back of a fish restaurant. And he let me book it. And in return I was allowed to go on and maybe I got 40 bucks a week. And that's how I got stage time for the first year when I didn't know what I was doing. I would book that club, which also gave me an excuse to call all the comics who I admired. And, and it's funny, like there's those people at a key moment opened the door for you, but it's not because you knew them, it's just because you're willing to put it all the work somehow. Right, right. That's interesting, man. Sammie's by the shore. I never heard about that one. Do you remember the Valley Improv? They had one in the Hilton in Sherman Oaks. No, I wasn't around for that.

Speaker 1:          01:34:23       And the year was that, it was like late eighties I wasn't here until 94 oh yeah, the late eighties and this guy, Joe drew, just the manager. Great Young Guy. I don't know where he is. He used to say to me, Judd, come in, wait around. If somebody doesn't show up, I'll put you up. And I was like 19 years old and I would wait there all night, every night. Thrilled to talk to everyone because that's what right when Sandler moved to town and David spade and, and Schneider. And that's when I first met everybody and that guy would put me on. And you know, that's the funny thing about a career. It's two or three who, who change everything for you. This is woman Mary parents who was one of the heads of universal and I was, I sold her the 40 old virgin and she said, Judd, the second you hand in the script, I'm going to green light it. I so believe in this idea and you and Steve. And I literally faxed her like page 90 to 108 and then she called and said, okay, start prepping facts. Yeah, faxed it. I'm that crazy. Joe, here's my question for you. Okay, let's, let's talk my workout for a second. Let's Talk My, uh, Omega Brain, Alphabet Alpha right now, Pete Holmes turned me onto the Alpha brain and oddly, it completely works 100% and I'm,

Speaker 3:          01:35:50       it's all based on science. I mean, we have double blind placebo controlled studies. It's not something we invented in terms of like the, the actual nutrients and their response to human neurotransmitter's. It's all been documented. People have known about nutrition

Speaker 1:          01:36:03       [inaudible] for a long time now. And I always feel like I'm the perfect test case for a product like that because most days I go in a room with 11 writers in the morning. I'm as tired and it is foggy as you can be. I do not drink coffee, so I don't, you don't drink coffee at all? I just don't like it. So I just, the only coffee I like his ice blended Mocha is, which is all sugar. Right. So I avoided, uh, and when I uh, started taking that I would completely wake up and be sharp without like some weird caffeine was or sick from it or whatever. And I would see it every day. Like wow, I was funny as hell for the last two and a half hours and I did not start in that place. So I'm fascinated by your general program, like what you're doing all day with all this stuff. Like what's, what's the current Joe Program? Well, um,

Speaker 3:          01:37:04       always doing something, you know. And in terms of like diet you mean or in terms of like

Speaker 1:          01:37:09       the workout with the Diet, what's the meditation? What's the main tenants of your day? Well,

Speaker 3:          01:37:15       my workout, I schedule every Sunday. I schedule everything that I'm going to do during the week. I say I have to do yoga two times this week. I have to lift weights three times this week. I have to run twice this week. And however I fit that in, I fit that in. But I owe those things. Okay. So I have to get those things in. The only exceptions are injuries and sickness. So those, that, that's the, the, the schedule. And then on top of that, uh, there's other things that I enjoyed doing. Kickboxing, Jujitsu, work those in when I can. Then, um, diet. The Diet is pretty strict in terms of like no bread, very few carbs, no sugar, no bullshit, like healthy food, a lot of vegetables, a lot of meat, game meat, mostly wild game. And I take vitamin supplements every day. I take multivitamins, I take probiotics, I take a vitamin B, 12 and D and a lot of different things.

Speaker 3:          01:38:09       I just, um, I do everything that I can to put my body and my brain in a good place so that I'm keeping my engine smooth. I'm changing my oil, I'm changing my spark plugs. I'm making sure that it's operating. I mean it's not going to be perfect, but yeah, I know that I've done my best to keep it working the best that it can. That who's the person that advises you on like nutrition because they're a guy, um, who told, taught you how to do it? How do you do it? Well, there's a ton of people that I've used as a resource. Um, there's a woman that I have on the podcast on a regular basis. Her name is Doctor Rhonda Patrick and she's probably the best resource. Like I sent her something the other day on some new, um, some new study on saturated fats.

Speaker 3:          01:38:52       Like whenever I, there's some sort of an issue, there's some new study on cryotherapy or Saunas. Saunas are incredibly effective. I don't know if you ever just gone, oh, so the UV rays or what is it? The, um, what is it called? Not Ultra violent. Um, infrared. They'd be ready. Yeah, we just got one of those Saunas are giant, you know, the raising of the body temperature like that, and a heat shock proteins, incredibly beneficial to your body. There was a study that they put out recently that showed a 40% decrease in mortality from all causes due to people who take regular sauna. Like it just literally keeps your body healthier. Wow. Having that massive exposure to heat and the your body producing these heat shock proteins, it just, it, it reduces inflammation. It just, it helps in so many different areas for people and it's just, you know, sit down in the hot room.

Speaker 3:          01:39:42       It's really good for your body. Regular is how many times a week? Um, for Sauna, I think they were saying four times a week. But I mean how hard is that man just force yourself to sit in it? I mean if you have it at home and in particular at your gym, just go there and sit in that fucker for 15 minutes. It doesn't take long. Well, I mean I have to get all this written up. I'm going to, how about this? I do everything you do. We make that a special, it's the judd does Joe's programs. He's have to heal up the bulk up. Well, I may have already bulked up build up like your joints and all that stuff. It's got to get used to that kind of a pounding. Yeah, there's a lot. A lot of shit is going to be happening if you want to do everything I do.

Speaker 3:          01:40:23       So I can't just do 12 pounds on a freeway. You just, you don't want, I mean it's not even, you don't, you're not going to want to do everything I do. Like I have a friend who runs ultra marathons and I just started running recently within the last couple months. I'm not running a fucking ultra marathon. I'm not doing everything. He, I'll do everything you do. I would break. It would break my feet, my knees. Yeah. You got to just build up. You gotta have time to, yes. There's something about, you know when you run a TV shows, it's all freaking day everyday. So people will say, when do you work out? I'm like, there's no time. What am I going to wake up at in the morning and put in two and a half hours? I, I drive my kids to school at seven 40. That's one thing.

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       You don't need two and a half hours. Yeah. You could get a great workout in, in 40 minutes and that's all you need for the whole day. 100%. You really can't, especially if you run like I run hills and I can get it done in a half an hour, like a fucking brutal workout, a two mile brutal hill climbing workout in half hour, I'm exhausted. Yeah. You know, this idea of time, like how much time did you put in today? Like you could work out in a bullshit manner for two hours and not get nearly as much done as you can for a half hour. Hard just running. Yeah. We're like interval training. Yeah. Yeah. Sprints and then relax. Then sprints again. But uh, I just think being active and doing something on a daily basis, forcing your body to get used to the fact that it's going to constantly being, be working constantly being under stress, and then it just, it gives you more energy.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       It's like you have more of a gas tank, you have more enthusiasm for things. That's the scary part about trump. His theory on exercises. You only have so much energy per day and he thinks that exercise uses it up. Yeah. And so he doesn't ever exercise. That's got to come back out of it someplace. Just fucking 70 I mean how was it? And I come back at him already, but he also, I mean he's, he's not mitigating it stress. That's part of it. Is Your perspective enhancing? For me the most important thing about, I don't think maybe they're not the most important thing. One of the best things about exercise is that it gives me a perspective, a better, a more enhanced perspective. Cause I know I'm not coming at it from a stressful body. Like my body is not tense so I can come at things in a calm way.

Speaker 3:          01:42:30       I've drained all the bullshit out of my budget thing. Yeah. And Are you doing meditation or what are you doing in that way? I have a sensory deprivation tank. Yeah. So I do most of my meditation in that you do an ultra climb and yeah, a climate and I float. Yeah, I love that. That's one of my favorite things that you ever do it? Uh, no I couldn't imagine you must especially for you because you're working on things all the time. Like if you go in there with an idea like I'll go in there with a bit like I got this bit that I'm working on right now, that's kind of complicated and sometimes we'll just be sitting there staring at the wall. Just thinking about this one bit because I'm trying to figure out how to, how to structure it. It's just super complicated bit and I'll go in that tank and I'll just sit there for an hour and I'll just try to work out this bit and tried to figure out if there are other angles to it is other ways to come at it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:16       The only confusing thing is when I have an idea in the tank and it seems like I got it, I got to get out of the tank and then I got to write things down. And you need a special pad and the pen. I think I need a voice activated recorder. I think that's a good idea. Yeah, I think that's what I need. Where I can just talk. Yeah. Okay. So I need the tank. You need to have the spa. You have a spa. Um, I need a hill to run on hills are good. I got, I need more of my audit products. Do you lift weights at all? Uh, no. I good idea to do a little bit of something just to keep your body strong. It's like as you get older, your body atrophies and

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       there's just no way around it. Especially if you're not using it. And the only way to keep it from atrophying is to make sure that you put it under stress. You have to lift weights. It's the only way it keeps your bone density, keeps your tendon strength, your muscle strength. There's no other way, you know, and otherwise he's got injuries. People get back into reason. Arm injuries and shit just starts falling apart on, you. See, I've had no injuries due to not doing anything. That's how I've been protecting by my body. But yes, I do know that that's the thing to do. I remember I always heard about Clint Eastwood doing that and I met Clint Eastwood when he was like 80. And I know he's like, he lifts heavyweights. That's his thing. It's like heavyweights. And he was a truck at 80. Yeah. And so, uh, but I don't like, uh, lifting things.

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       I don't even like counting, counting hire a trainer. Yeah. You know, get someone to devise a program. Yeah. Have them come to you, work you out. You don't have to do shit. You just show up. You know, like you could do it in your house. They show up at 6:00 AM or whenever it is and like, come on John, I got you for the next 45 minutes and you're like, all right, here we go. And just make, when you hate that stuff really is tough when you haven't built your brain to love it. I've been playing a lot of tennis lately as a way to great wake up and uh, but I do know that I need to do it, but man, it is when you're like of the mindset that when the trainer comes, you want to punch him in the face. It's a tough, it's a tough thing.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       I know a lot of it is being a writer. Your, your day becomes about waking up and engaging your brain all day. And so you just like look at writers and eat Chinese food and you're kicking stuff around and it's like developing the wrong muscle your whole life or at least not only one muscle. And uh, I know that I have to transition into that, but it is, it is a tough one to one. I stopped, I official to your writing. Now it is, it 100% is I write better after I do anything. And what I do do is I walk really fast around my neighborhood in circles for like 45 minutes every day. They say, you should do that after you're right. They say when you ride, one of the things you should do is go over what you wrote by going on a walk because it's not enough where you're so worn out that you're occupied by the, like, it's not like you're running or you're exhausted.

Speaker 2:          01:46:06       You're occupied by the activity. Cause I feel like when I'm running hard, especially when I do my hill sprints, I'm not thinking about shit other than left foot. Right foot, left foot, right foot. Don't fall down, keep going. We're almost at the hill, almost at the top. Keep going, keep going, keep going. I don't wanna thinking about anything else, but when I walk I can think about all kinds of shit. So I walk my dog around the neighborhood a lot of times after that. Right. Just take him. We'll go for a walk. And that's like a walking meditation. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I'm, I'm trying to read a lot like, and you guys talk about it sometimes. I heard you talking about with Russell brand, just, you know, quantum physics and trying to figure out how to quiet my brain and to tune into what is left to

Speaker 1:          01:46:49       do, to not be crazy. And some of that is exercise because left to do, to not be crazy. Exactly. Cause I was such a like a such a pop psychology junkie. Yeah. I read that stuff all day long. But lately I've been reading a little more like the, you know, the Joe Dispenza, is that his name? Joe Dispenza. Yeah. But it's, you know, it's just, it's, it's a cook quantum physics theory that basically you get into a pattern of how you feel and it's in yourself. So if you're a depressed person, like yourselves are depressed and if you get in a good mood, your cells try to get you back to depression because you've conditioned yourself to be in a certain mood all the time physically and it affects your whole body and that you can make a choice to change how you are physically by choosing to be in a certain mood and meditating about a certain mood and that you could change how your body reacts physically. So it doesn't want to keep you in the same mental state you're used to being in. Does that make any sense? It does sort of, I guess I'm always real cautious about what, what causes depression and what makes people depressed and what, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:48:01       I don't, I don't suffer from depression, so like whenever someone says you're depressed because of this, I'm always like, hmm, okay. I don't know how to address that because I don't know what, I know there's certain people that do have absolute chemical imbalances, but what does that chemical imbalance come from? Does it come from childhood trauma? Does it come from just some sort of a part of their body that's not functioning correctly, like a bad thyroid or a bad kidney? Is the brain like very similar? Is that the case or are they in a bad economic situation? In a bad relationship with bad friends and a bad job? Is that what's causing depression? Like I think there's a host of variables.

Speaker 1:          01:48:38       Yeah, it's a, you get an a pattern. You don't know. You don't know why. I mean your family to do your parents. Uh, did they stay together? No. Yeah. So you

Speaker 3:          01:48:50       step ma or my stepdad rather, and my mom had been together since I was seven. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:54       So you had the stable. Yes. Yeah. And I think that's, I always think that's 90% of it. When you grow up in chaos, I think you get wired for a certain hyper vigilance and, and nervousness and anxiety because you think like more bad shit's coming. Yeah. So if you had any kind of trauma as a kid, I think you're wired to keep your eyes open a little wider, which also lends itself to some kind of depression. It could,

Speaker 3:          01:49:17       most certainly for me, uh, that hypervigilance led itself to martial arts. Yeah. And then it's also, we moved around a lot, so I was picked on a lot, so I was like, I was always the new kid. I was like, God, this fucking sucks, you know? So that, that sort of led me to be wary of others and just, you know, be internalize a lot of stuff. Sure. Um, I think I, that's what I did. I just went in my room and watch the Mike Douglas show and watch Merv Griffin. Did you know, you knew, so that from the time you were 17, you were working at East side comedy club, you kind of knew you always wanted to be involved in common. From the time I was 10,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       I was into the Marx brothers first, then like cosby and George Carlin and, uh, I used to listen to lenny bruce records as a kid. I didn't understand them, but I just heard that's the best person. And I always, I think I liked that comedians just called out bullshit. And I must have felt like there was a lot of bullshit around me because I liked the and called. Yeah, I liked that. It was like George Carlin was like, no, this makes no fucking sense. And so I love those people. And, and, and the lighter stuff too, like just silly comedians who just pointed out the ridiculousness of things. So I loved Seinfeld when I was a kid and, and Leno, but especially Carlin, I think when I was little, well Groucho Marx is pretty underrated and under appreciated to this day. Like my roommate, he was hosting that show you bet your life. Oh, absolutely. So funny and so dirty and weird people like, and, and even like when you watch them and be like, duck soup, the Marx brothers movie, it's all about the ridiculousness of government. And uh, and something drew me to those people. I think it was also because I was bad at sports and so I thought this system's unfair. Like, so I'm a Dick because I can't play softball.

Speaker 1:          01:51:00       So it led me to like look for something else. But back then, no one else likes comedy. There wasn't another person to talk to about it. Now I think everyone likes it. But back then there was no one was watching Merv Griffin but me really when I was little, I mean it, when I was 15 I didn't like come to school and we would laugh about Jeff Altman on Merv Griffin. I was just alone with it.

Speaker 3:          01:51:22       Wow. Yeah. I became a fan of a standup watching standup on TV, like watching like the tonight show and evening at the Improv and stuff like that. But really the big one, the run that really kicked in for me was my parents took me to see live on the sunset strip. Oh Wow. And I was a teenager, young teenager. And uh, I remember being in the audience while Richard Pryor was onstage slaying and people were laughing so hard and I was laughing so hard. I looked around, I'll never forget this moment cause I looked around at the crowd while the movie was going on and all these people were like falling out of their chairs after their knee holding her chest. And I was like, this guy's just talking. He's just talking. And he's this funny, this is incredible. I'm like, this is an amazing thing this guy can do like I'd never seen real standup before.

Speaker 3:          01:52:12       I had only seen like, you know, like someone on the Johnny Carson show do a couple minutes and tell a few jokes. That in my mind was what stand up was. It wasn't until, and I had listened to some of the old bill cosby stuff and some of the old Carlin stuff on, on uh, records, but I'd never seen it like seeing the movie live on the sunset strip and that planted didn't plant a seed. Like I can do it, but it did plant a seed. Like Holy Shit, this is possible. Like this is crazy that this is possible. It's still the best special. It's one of the best ever. Without a doubt. He's still, he holds up in a, in a very, very unique way where a lot of comedy from that era just immune including lenny bruce doesn't really hold up like gets caught be. It's because it's contextual.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       Like if you were there in that time, it was groundbreaking, but that's not groundbreaking anymore because the culture has moved on so far. And a lot of that could be attributed to his insight like Lenny Bruce incite change the way a lot of people thought and discussed a lot of like really important issues at that time. But there was something about priors, his honesty and his, his delivery and his point of view that's like to this day like God, he was good. I, I, there was a record they put out a few years ago where they didn't tell you what album it was, but it was just bits and I think maybe a lot of, of of bits that were recorded when he recorded an album but didn't make the album. Like it was just, it was, it was, uh, an eras like seventies, 80s, 90s. And when you listen to his stuff from the 70s, it's so militant.

Speaker 3:          01:53:46       Yeah. It's so milton and it all works perfectly today. Like what he's mad about. Yeah, all applies to right now. And then when he goes honest about himself and relationships, you do feel it. Like, oh, there's not many people opening it up like this. Right. Like there's not a comparable person. There's a lot of comedians who talk about their lives, but he's really, he's ripping open the, the veins much deeper than anybody even now. Sure. And he was talking about horrific addiction issues that he had back then. I mean, addiction issues that caused them to light himself on fire. Yeah. I mean when he was talking about that back then, who the hell had done that? You remember he would do that thing. We would light a match and, and move it around. Like what, who am I? I'm Richard Pryor running down the street and joke around about lighting himself on fire and, and have the whole audience laugh.

Speaker 3:          01:54:40       It was like, wow. It was crazy. There was some bits where he talked about having multiple sclerosis near the end of his life and he was still doing the comedy store and on audio they were riot asleep. Funny, brutally honest bits about, you know, what it felt like to be that sick. And I don't think it ever was on an album before when he was doing that. Um, when he was, uh, coming back to the comedy store when he was really sick before he died, I was the guy who went on after him every night, every night for like five weeks. So Geez, every time he did his show, I bombed so many times going on after Richard Pryor. Oh, it was death. And how was he terrible? He was, he was old and he was sick and he was drunk and he was on pills and he probably shouldn't have been there, but he just wanted to do it. It wasn't good. Like it wasn't, it wasn't Richard Pryor. It was like they had it, first of all, he was really unhealthy so they had to crank the microphone up. Like

Speaker 4:          01:55:41       you couldn't even hear Shira

Speaker 3:          01:55:42       barely hear him and you know, he would like, I always love pussy. Like it wasn't, there was nothing there. Yeah, he was just kind of talking and ranting and he would, you know, he'd be on stage with a drink and people didn't know how to respond and they would give him this amazing round of applause when he got on stage. And it took forever for them to get them to the stage because chewy who worked the door and this guy dave, um, would carry Richard prior to the stage and slowly just move him towards the stage and all the time that people would be clapping and then they would sit him down and then they would put the microphone in place and crank that fucking thing up to 10 and then he would do is stand up. But it was, it was people almost like paying all much Omaj the paying homage. They were there, they were there to see the great one, you know, when he was there and he's still alive and it's like, wow, we're seeing like the greatest standup comedian of all time. He's right there. Wow. You know, it was more of that than it was like him doing really well. It was never like a good set. I never saw him kill.

Speaker 2:          01:56:45       And then you would come out, how was he eat dick just go up there and just eat plates of Shit. People were so depressed. So way on. What was your attempt to uh, to pull out of it? Um, I would go on stage and I would say, and now ladies and gentlemen and unknown White Guy after the greatest comedians of all time, this douchey looking Italian looking kid, I would just make fun of myself for a few minutes and you know, and then sometimes

Speaker 3:          01:57:15       about how, uh, Richard Pryor was like, you know, cause I would take a long time for him to get off the stage too. So that was the other thing. Like I would get introduced by Jeff who's a piano man and I would pass Richard and Dave and Chewy as they were carrying Richard off. Like you'd have to kind of move around them and then get onto the stage and then you'd have to say, Richard Pryor, ladies and gentlemen, give it, and sometimes ppc people's eyes, they were like, fuck, like, what did we just see? Like this is so to facing their own mortality. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And you know Richard, like I remember like he wasn't supposed to drink but he drank anyway cause they had them on all this medication and you're like fuck you just kept drinking. It was weird. It was, it was dark.

Speaker 2:          01:58:00       I remember meeting him at a birthday party. I went with Jim character to his birthday party and it was, it was sad. I mean it was, it was sad to see but somebody that ill and then especially when you think of just the power of the guy, just how crazy funny he was. Cause there's not that many people just took the core funny. They, I remember when Robin Williams, we used to come into the Improv in the late eighties and he would kill so hard. There was just no way to recover the room couldn't recover. Yeah. And there's not that many people can do that now. I feel like people could follow each other now. You know Louie comes in and you go on after him and you know and, and like he kills. But like Robin Williams would come in like you wanted to end the show, right?

Speaker 2:          01:58:44       Well, there was only one of him then, you know, and now there's like Louis, but then there's bird and then there's Diaz and then there's, there's a lot of guys now, there's Santino and Ari Shaffir and this like, there's so many funny people now maybe the audience understands in a different way and they can transition. They, they're, they're used to comedy and they're like, oh, now this guy where the old days you'd come on and there's, you know, they couldn't go and, oh, we're about to enjoy this, this popery of people. Right. Well, she's still see people bomb after someone who kills. Yeah. Still, that's still happens all the time. But I think that, um, maybe I was more, I think what you're getting at the store now, and this is what's been really interesting lately, is you're getting a lot of comedy tourism. Yeah. Like a lot of people fly over from Europe just to come to the store all in lot a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       And it's worth it. Those lineups are crazy. Some night. Oh yeah. Like, I'll look at the lineup and go, does this audience understand how insane this is? Yeah, yeah. And there's three shows going on simultaneously. There's a belly room, the original room in the main room and everyone, and you know a lot of guys do hat tricks. Well, they'll do all three rooms and one night the seller's like that, the comedy cellar in New York, there's three rooms and you go in some nights and it's like, yeah. Chappelle's come in. Rock just left like really tonight? Yeah. Schumer's here. There's only a few of those places I had to follow Andrew Dice Clay and Ray Romano, the seller. Once it was like the cleanest guy and the dirtiest guy. Do you know I had the worst sets after ever ways it could not follow Martin Lawrence. Oh yeah. Martin Lawrence in the 90s sure.

Speaker 2:          02:00:23       I remembered Chris Rock says that Martin Lawrence was opening up for him in the 90s, uh, or, or you know, before he did his big specials and that he was downstairs in the dressing room and he could feel the theater rocking. And he went on stage and he said he had had some shows where he couldn't follow him the way he wanted to and that's what made him work hard and then develop those great specials because having Martin opened for him scared him. Yeah. Well he also said that he did too many crowds in front of white people. Yeah. Too many shows in front of white crowds and they were just too, too happy and too, except day and Martin Lawrence or just bring the thunder dude. He was so strong before he put the wetsuit on and ran around with a gun in the middle of the city and the in the heat, like a whatever fuse he blew. But before that, that fucking guy would go onstage with a leather jumpsuit on and just destroyed. I mean destroy in a level that people don't appreciate today. People forgot about him. Everything. Gary Owen. Yes, I was as hell. It's a two in a set. I was playing Bonnaroo and biff. I wanted to go on the night before to warm up and I went to xannies and Nashville and he's there and I hadn't seen him before and I did

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       a set and uh, you know, it was okay. It wasn't very good. It was just fine. And then he gets on. I don't, I've never heard louder left. I've never heard louder last me and my manager, Jimmy Miller sat in the back of the room and we were like, what is happening? And then we start really paying attention going, how funny is this guy? Like, like listening to the material? Like is this good material or is he pandering or what is it? Then we're like, wait a second, here's the materials. Incredible. Like he is awesome. And it was the biggest labs I've ever heard. He had a sustained like killing the crowd, you know, where the place is just rocking and moving up and down. It's just a lot of black shows, right? Yes. And uh, he went full 20, 25 minutes at 10 before he slowed it down and had to slow it down and he was going to kill these people.

Speaker 1:          02:02:28       And I swear I thought, I don't know if I'm in the same businesses, this guy like, is this what we're supposed to do? Well when you, when you jumped back into it, you thought that three years ago you're just going to have some fun and go and do it. When was it that you realize like I am a comic now, I've got a kind of like really aspire to a high standard, like I have to really tighten everything up. I think, um, you know, I would, I was watching Louie work on his new set very seriously at the comedy cellar and he'd say, yeah, I got nothing. I got nothing tonight and go onstage and just crush. And then I played Carnegie Hall and I had a good set for the New York comedy festival. And then as a surprise, I brought sandler out to do a surprise set after me and I thought I did great.

Speaker 1:          02:03:17       And then when he came out the, the laughter went up 20% where I felt it like, oh, I'm like at a seven and he's at a nine and a half. Like it was a diff, the sound changed and I thought, oh, there's a whole nother step here that I need to kick into gear. I always want the material to be good, but that, oh, there's a a way to crush that's hard to do, to get that momentum and have the ideas. And obviously Chris Rock is one of the best of everybody at it because he has so many great ideas, but understands how to get the room rock and really hard. The cadence and the peace and the, and to find what, what is in your cadence that does it, that doesn't become obnoxious or loud or just, you know, just talking fast. Like how do you find an original way to create that energy in a room?

Speaker 1:          02:04:11       I think the only way it's constant repetition. You have to be on stage all the time. Yeah. And you have to really always be trying to improve it and you have to always be listening to your recordings and you have to have, and you've got to listen to bad sets. Two sets go bad. You got to go, why didn't that go back? And let's listen to this fucking thing. I always hear myself mumble like, oh, they didn't even hear what I said. That's big. I got to stumble. Well, I gotta get Outta here. I gotta go pick up a child. Oh, I'm going to do my end of the show. Plage he'll drink. I got

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       the big sick. Get a website, dude. Okay. I squarespace website. So you're saying there's a place called squarespace that has websites. I've heard about this can make your own website. Okay. I'm at the Wilbur on the 24th in Boston. July 24th 23rd richfield play house in Connecticut and the 25th canceling Canetti Columbus Theater. Providence, Rhode Island, Connecticut. Higgs. Why is that? I always do, which is for the hat of the work in Connecticut. I'm not kidding. It's not a real estate. Okay, I'm going to die. I'm going to figure that out to highway between Boston and New York. I'm gonna let you know if that's true. Don't do it. But as of now, talk later after that you're like, oh my God, you were so right that Connecticut Gig was horrible. I need Connecticut people to show me he's wrong. All these Connecticut people are mad at me now. I get emails from connect it, Bro. How about Leo Fucking Connecticut? How about drive to Boston or drive from New York and recognize the fuck you doing John Appetite. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me. Thanks for being here, man. That's it for the week. Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker 5:          02:05:43       Yeah.
