Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Right back.

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       We're back. Perfect. Amy on point. Right? That time when the round starts, I like how they're doing that. Well, they have like a, a seven eighths commercial.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       Pretty Rhonda rousing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:14       All right. Second round. Very interesting. Who's better than herb dean as a referee? I say no one and it's good. I see. I think he's the best

Speaker 2:          00:00:26       big. John McCarthy gets a little bossy. I've seen that happen a few times. The hardest I got to bring this up. The hardest one I ever saw was a, uh, I wanna say Frodo versus Marlin. Sandro. Uh, there was a nut shot and John says, I don't think no. Was that bad. You have two minutes. Yeah. When I'm there going, you can't do that. It makes sense as the commentary. I have to explain that the referee just said something that doesn't make sense. Doesn't make any sense. Thank [inaudible]. Can't do that Jeremy. Just tag cub with a nice right hand. So that's the knock on, on big John. How bout this? This Strauss fight. When James Strauss fought Bobby, Bobby Green and Bobby Green kicked him in the nuts two times. Had Him hurt bad then kicked him in the nuts a third time so hard. You can hear the cup or the palm heard the pop of the cup and big John said it was a gut shot and stopped the fight and you know, I think knew that he fucked up but just didn't want to admit it. That was a mistake. That was just a mistake. I mean everybody makes mistakes. Yeah. Especially when you're in something like you're refereeing in MMA. I mean he's still one of my all time favorites and he did a great fucking job. Popped him again. He's a monster man. He's just hit so hard. He smiled at them and they touch gloves afterwards.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Yeah. Jeremy's power. That fucking power or something, man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       Oh, when he goes to the body there,

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       the problem is if your cub Swanson, you'd have to stay busy cause you gotta outland the guy, you can't go one for one with Jeremy Stevens. Well he's doing a lot of thinking and he's thinking a lot. Yeah, yeah. He's got to do a lot of thinking. You've got this fucking monster in front of you. So that's the problem is you have to stay busy to Atlanta, but you don't, you can't leave a vulnerability for go. It's that hard. You just can't. Yeah. And he's quick. Yeah. Jeremy's not slow and he's, he was not counter fighter too. He's not just an aggressive guy. He's good at setting shit up. That was a nice inside leg kick. He's really come a long way since he went to alliance to Eric Delphia. I was doing a great job with him.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       It's just, it's so fucking huge to have good coaching. You've been with Oyama your entire career now. I started with Chris Brennan and then I left Christmas to go to Jeremy Generation. Tim Ngi, next generation. Back in the day of those guys. I was a fucking kid, you know, I just [inaudible] he's right now. He's in trouble. Damn. That was a hard fucking punch. Oh Shit. Holy Shit. She's not smiling at this one now. Then he smiles. Yeah, Dude. Jeremy Stevens can fucking bang. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:02:58       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       COMP is a, it's gotta be very careful. He looks all tentative now too, right? He, I would, I would be, yeah, he's got fucking cracked a couple of times, especially Jeremy at one 45 carrying all that power down is in a weird thing. Power. It's like you can't really eat, can only teach so much. You can teach a guy to hit harder, but you can never teach a guy to be like a Tommy Hearns. You either have that shit or you don't see, my brother got the power in the family. He hits a fucking truck, but I just, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       I didn't get it. It's weird isn't it? You just, either you get it or you don't like a joke. Oh, we tried that cartwheel kick again. Like a guy like George Foreman,

Speaker 3:          00:03:42       you can never teach. I got a punch like that. They just, they, you could either do it or you don't. So strange because you can get a guy stronger. You can lift

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       weights and you can be physically strong. You can take it to it. Like you said, you can take it to a certain degree in teach you gotta really turn over a punch, stuff like that, but right. Yeah. But you can never develop a Pino Quavis left hook. No. Uh, you have that Hook because you have that power. It carries through technique. And what's your technique? It's better. You just punched fucking harder and better. Yeah. You just get better. But there's certain guys like they have that rocky Marciano thing. Yeah. That Marsianno Jersey Joe Walcott and knock out, there's like a classic photo up against the rope. His arm's hanging there and he sees conveyancing Walcott's face and walkouts faces all distorted like Marsianno had that creepy power,

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       that weird thing. They were guys can just, just fuck your world up with one shot and you either have that or you don't. It's weird, you know, great fighters who go their entire career without that one weapon. You know, Jeremy, Steve and shoots her, it gets a take down too. That was one of the things that core mia was talking about in the breakdown was a Steven should threaten with a take down or to just to, uh, just to keep cub Swanson thinking it's freezes people up a lot, man. Yeah. And he's right in front of his corner too. There's the active yarrow right in front of the alliance team. Great fucking team in San Diego. It's a good round for Steven's. Huge round cubs wants, got a bunch of roses on his leg. It's an interesting choice. Ooh. Now they're good, right? Yeah. I would like to hear what a cubs corners telling him, man. I would love to hear what they have to say. Wonder what kind of advice they're giving him.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       You know what a what an accident is Jackson using? Is He? That was hilarious. That Russian accent. I think they have a game that they play. Oh my God likes it when he talks to him like that. Thinks it's funny. At least that's what he said.

Speaker 3:          00:05:44       He's doing his best fucking lock impression. That was a big fucking wind for Henderson. Beaten Hobby Loft. Yeah. Finishing him. Yeah. Finishing it with a rear naked. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       just lower down. When we don't deliver that lower Napo come on back. Come back to the fucking

Speaker 3:          00:06:01       lower down and come back with something. Look at this Jeremy Stevens, a mother fucker, and that's that right hand over the top. They're really clipped him two big rounds for Jeremy Stevens, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:06:19       Jimmy looks fucking good man. Yeah, it's gotta be the beard. It's a little bit of everything, man. He's just, he's amped up man. The kids motivated round three should see when he wakes up in the morning with his kids,

Speaker 4:          00:06:31       fire it up five or six in the morning. But it's shame. That was all you used to go down there and just what he does and oh yeah. If it gets up at like six and they see him as kids are fucking chant and marching around the house cooking breakfast. They say fire it up, fire it up. Really? And Shane didn't wake up early, so that's what he does. So he's got like a champ that he does in the morning. Wow. Oh it did. Just to get his kids up out of bed. Oh, that's hilarious. My mom used to sing and I was like, mom, get out of my room. You are an early morning person. Stop it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       I don't believe there are early, early morning people. There's people that just wake up earlier than you and they want you to think they are early morning people so they have some sort of edge on you.

Speaker 4:          00:07:09       No. If you have no reason to get, if it's Sunday and you're up at five in the morning like my mom are and you love that Shit, you are an early morning person. She will get up at five five 30 on a Sunday for no reason. That's ridiculous. Hey,

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       that's ridiculous. My daughter woke me up at like six dad will sleep till noon. I don't know how they ever spoke to one of you. My kids will climb on top of me at five in the morning. Started asking me questions. Yeah, and I'm like, go away. They're so cute though. Go hang out with GRANDPA. My four year old, she would just touch my face. Daddy, give me kiss. Oh, you're cute. And so sweet. Can we go in the pool? Five of the vulgar morning. You want to swim? Nice, right hand. The right hand.

Speaker 4:          00:07:49       I knew better than trying to wake my dad up at six in the morning. I got thrown through a window. I got to seriously, my dad did not play one daughter who is a fucking princesses. Me and my dad living in the house. So she's just got us fucking wrapped around her finger. She just, I'm like, oh go get a, she awakes two and a half should wake up, take her diaper off coal. Come try and wake me up and a up with a nice right hand there man. Oh he is hurt another right hand. Yep. Oh now can you, oh Jeremy Ryan. He's stunned. He is and he's still trying to protect that body yet. It's still hurting. He can't bring his right hand up cause he's keeping the oval down there. He's reacting from the body and cubs season goes from the left hook. He went with the left hook upstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:08:37       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:08:38       And he brought it from down low cut. Oh right hand. Oh beautiful. That's the accuracy of cub. He's got such good accuracy and that's something you saw on the Seaver fight. Oh good takedown defense to Jeremy's a little bit of trouble seeing breed there. Just trying to breathe to get those the flow back to his lungs because he is

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       a body shots taken everything out of him.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:59       Yeah. That body shot really fucked him up man. That kick and cubs switching that stance against to looking forward again, looking for that left kick cub needs a recharge. There were no obvious with that left here. Throw that thing just hit the body cause whether they can block it because even if you block it you're hurting. Yeah. Well I think he was throwing it up high just because he figured he was going to protect his ribs at all costs. Jeremy's still hurting, man. He's still hurting. You see the power difference. Cub landed some great shots in sequence in Gi clinic. Get Steven's office feet. Yeah

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       man. Interesting fight. Very interesting. Very, very interesting and interesting to see what kind of damage Jeremy is sustained from that kick to the body. You know a lot of guys get broken ribs from that kick to the body a lot. Do you remember that Heath Herring Cro cop picture? Yup. There was a picture of a cro cop where he threw a left body kick and it's halfway into heath herrings, abdomen. It literally looks like he got thrown from a car wrapped around a telephone pole. Like, Whoa, who is it? Who did he leave the, the, the toe of the foot bruise on Vandelay Silva man. That was the first fight. Famous footprint. Yeah. That was back when Vandelay and him had that weird rules where they only find the ground for 30 seconds. They just wanted to stand in bludgeon each other. Well, there was a, it was first time that cro cop had fought MMA.

Speaker 3:          00:10:26       Yeah. Weird hybrid match. He wanted some weird rules and if it, if nothing happened, if nobody finished anybody who was a draw. Yeah. Yeah. So that's how that fight turned out a draw. And then in the rematch, he just beat the career out of it and the rematch, it was full cro cop. There's the, there's the uh, photo right there. There's the picture. Look at that picture. Oh my God. Oh my God. The photo of Marco's fucking Chin halfway into heath herrings body is so terrifying. It's wrapping around. That's a perfect kick. I, so can you, can you kick any better than that? That's about it. It's perfect. And here Jeremy and cub going at it in the third round. Jeremy cannot wait for this round to be over. This is amazing fight so far though. Yeah, it is. Well, good knee to the body by cub.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       Do you think everyone always says hey. Oh Hey, there's that Mexican actor. Ooh, Mexican actor. Oh, that guy. I didn't see that movie, but I know who that guy is. I've seen him in other shit. Let me hear what they're saying. Give us some volume, Jamie

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       to work. They're like, attacks are good. I need combinations. Two to three punches.

Speaker 3:          00:11:57       There's talking about combination. I want to know about his Bonnie deep breath here. It is slanted. Yeah. Right to the liver man that look on your face when you know it's coming and he can't stop it. Is that right hand over the top? Look how accurate cub is. Yup. He's so fucking accurate in these wild malaise.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:24       It was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen as far as like combinations of techniques landed was his fight with Seaver. Yeah, it was. Yeah cause it was, everything was bunched up in one certain fucking box. Yeah. And he was, there were, you know, Siva was moving away and he was chasing after him was still catching with everything. Here's a good kick by cub cubs coming on strong and that third round. This is a very interesting fight. Now round two definitely. You got to give to Jeremy Stevens. Round three definitely got to give to cub the first round. I think Steven's one. But you put your, you're heading into subjective in competence area. You know when a fight is close it's like you would like experts to call it,

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       but they're not. That's the weirdest thing about MMA judging. It's, they're not experts at all. Some lady that got the job because she knew somebody. Then the question, I mean for, for people who don't know anything about MMA that are listening to this, you would think they were exaggerating, but we're, we're not exaggerating. MMA judging is the worst out of any sport in the world that you could think of where you have like experts that are watching the contest at the highest level and they're, they're aware of the subtle nuances of ebb and flow. The fight world. Well, that must be the case in MMA, surely, where there's billions of dollars on the line. Multinational corporations owned by Viacom and people called zoo fa and by they would ensure that these headings or someone else's life judged correctly. Cool. Courier. No, they're just fucking terribly, they're the worst judged contests probably in all of professional sports is MMA. There's more in competence in a MMA judging and more judging being done by people who have no idea what they're watching. Just guesswork. We'll have no background in the sport, no background, not even as an amateur, not, not as an amateur competitor, not even as a person who practices it and not even a martial artist. No martial arts background at all.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:32       A lot of the delays, sometimes we'll get on when there's a bad decision and there's, there's a delay. A lot of times our ring announcer, Michael C. Williams is going around making sure that they knew it was the right person. Like you know they're the one with the gray shorts and then the want the red shorts. Right. We had one where they had mixed it up, dad gone the wrong person. He had to go around and go, uh, you know they have the retro, it's like Oh hold on. And they scratched it and put different, different numbers in there. It has happened man

Speaker 3:          00:15:00       and competence. It's just the sport was kind of like nudged in and one of the Wa the big pieces of evidence that it was nudged in is the adoption of the 10 point must system. It's just not a good system. It was too much going on in MMA and boxing. That system makes sense cause you're only boxing. But when you have boxing with knees, elbows, kicks, and then take downs and then submissions and then ground impound, all those variables that don't exist in, in a boxing scoring system, it's just the 10 points. It's just not enough. What does it do? Like a 30 point system. That's a good idea. Groundwork takedowns and then strike it. And it's still all subjective though. You'd have to know what the fuck is going on. Like you'd have to know, like sometimes the guys caught in a, in a guy's, uh, like a guy got, has a guy's nice and a lot of trouble and sometimes the guys not in trouble at all. And you have to be able to differentiate between a guy who's defending really well and a guy who's not defending well at all. It was on the brink of getting finished at any second. There's a difference. Well, cubs smiling because he defended a takedown. Good. He punched the body. They're in short range. He's taking that right hand at the body.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       How, how hard are those knees to the thigh on the Europe, the hero of the cage like that? How much of those suck? I don't, I don't know. Do you know, feel him at the time? No. I mean, you're so amped up with adrenaline. Yeah. And you just kind of get past the pain thing. That's just, that's going to go away. Or when you're in training, do you wear, do you wear knee pads when you're in training, when you do those? Sometimes, yeah. I won't need without any pads on. I mean that's just not really fair. They can fuck each other up is rude. Yeah, exactly. It's just some, some rude shit to do to each other. It's like foot stomps and training. You have to be an asshole. It's fucking stupid. Front knee kicks. Oh yeah. Those are brutal. Those little bleak kicks in front, like so kicks at Jon Jones does to the PSI effective, but they're an old cub. Just Nice. He's blitzkrieg ing. Jeremy's starting to slow down a little bit.

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       I noticed a number of training where I got kicked a need around the muscle. When they find that space in between the muscles.

Speaker 3:          00:17:09       Ooh. Oh Man. It was always terrible the next day. That's the accuracy of real Thai baht. Real Thai guys at one spot and the kick it twice and you're like, fuck 'em I'm sucks over this. Vanessa, who's used to always get that spot right above the knee where the bone meets the top of the quad or the bottom on the quad stopped. He googled Changin with kicks and K one. Yeah, there's a few of those guys that tried to venture forth in the k one from MMA work. Tourists results, oftentimes disastrous results. But rampage did that. A lot of people forget. Rampage fought Mike Bernardo and beat them and beat them in fucking k one rampage was a beast in his prime. I mean, it's Kinda sucks now here, and I'm talking about retirement and Hayden and yeah, he's still fighting, but you could tell he's kind of on his way out doing it for the money. Yeah. Job Security. Yeah. Well it's a lot of money. Me, he's got a bunch of kids too. There's a lot going on. You got to keep that money coming in.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       It's, but it's, it's one of those guys, he was the first guy ever rolled with ever wrap on a mat was rampage. I'm actually, that was fun. Yeah. Um, he brings it up a lot when, when we're hanging out and every time I see him and, uh, uh, nice. Look at that. Nice. Neat. Naturally when the most incredibly strong people. Yeah. He's so strong. My God. Yeah. I rolled with him before when we were filming that a UFC, whatever the fuck it was show for spike. Yeah. So strong. It's ridiculous. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       Final round here. Hey, that last round one to, it's a good question. That's a close one. It was close.

Speaker 1:          00:18:50       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       I wasn't really paying attention enough to score it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:54       You know, I don't like, I mean sometimes a rounds obvious, but even when I'm doing commentary, I don't know because what I'm doing commentary, I'm trying to point out all these different things about, around and I'm not doing it. I think if you're going to score around, you should shut the fuck up and you should have a piece of paper in front of you and you should be marking things down. You know, Eddie Bravo used to do it in between fights. Um, in between rounds he would talk about the round and you know, I'd have like an official scorekeeper, like a, they have Harold Harold betterment for the u s or for a boxing and Eddie used to have two columns, one for each guy and he would have all these marks down as far as like hard kicks that were landed punches that were landed near submissions and he had a whole system that he would do and it was a very accurate system. I agreed with every one of his little, a little in fight inbetween round things, creativity, being smart and being knowledgeable of what the fuck's going on. Control. There's a lot of variables. I just think that there, there's too many variables for a 10 point must system. We need our own system and I don't, I don't know what the hell is going to be. I would like them to Kipp come up with better fucking gloves and I would like them to come up with a better scoring system. Those are my two number one gripes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       I have to score mine for belts or, and I have some, some fighters to get pissed at me, man. Yeah. Sorry Dude. Why did they make you it is dead. It's always a good idea. And I was like, all right, I don't mind doing it. You know, you should probably tell them, well, I don't know, do whatever the fuck you want. But I would probably tell them I don't want to do that anymore. I don't mind doing it. Just, you know, just who I think won and why and you know, it's just a good template for right. Here's why. I think in, in explaining the scorecard, it does make me break it down what I'm thinking while I'm watching it. Right. So I do like it. Do you write things down when you're scoring? Like when you were doing commentary, do you write anything down? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes I do. Most of the time I do. Yeah. I, I just try to, when I'm doing commentary, since I don't have to score, I just try to be, oh damn. He's hitting them hard with that left. Oh, another right hand is on a man. Oh, cartwheel kick. Beautiful Double Jab. Look at them. Hands Down right hand. Oh, he's taken over. Jeremy's a bloody mess too.

Speaker 2:          00:21:08       He's so creative. Like look what he just did there. He ducks down wings, that overhead. Old Left Hook. So every time he's so accurate man. And Punch in with your head off of the, you know the beeline punch in the same area and still have you and have your head off of, you know, whatever line you're going on. The other lead. Right? Two minutes ago though. Good combinations. This, this round is still kicking. Jeremy's got a lot of blood coming out of that nose. Oh, splattering everywhere. Yeah. His face is a mess. Oh, come throws a lot of off speed stuff too. He does things. He's really hard to figure out what he's going to do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       Very sneaky with the way he moves at you hit like slow, slow, fast. You know, he does a lot of that nice left hook there and it's hard to see. It's a lot of times it's hard to see punches it come from the hip like that. Yeah. Very difficult. Especially, we have good head movement and he's got very good movement. Very good waste movement back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       Damn. Yeah, I'm happy I don't have to score this fucking thing. I really, I just get to watch it and I have to worry about it. Well, I just don't know man. I just, I think if I was going to score around and do, do my best at it, I really would shut the fuck up. Yeah, you'd have to. Yeah. Which I'm sure some people would like. I cannot, I've got to talking and score. It's nice left hook again by carb. This is all cub this round. Yeah, totally. Jeremy's got to know that. I mean this is a, it's a very interesting situation. I think you all my hinge on that fourth round was real close. Yeah. Right. Cause three and five are definitely cub. I would say one and two are Stephen's right now. Well this is all that fourth round just looked up at the clock.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       This is a perfect example of why one brown being a ten nine and this round being a ten nine is ridiculous. Yeah. So the round that was really close, if that was a ten nine for either one of those guys. And then this is a ten nine round for cub. That's fucking crazy. That highlights how fucked up the system is because carb is schooling him in this round and Cobb also schooled him and that other route. Oh, Jeremy Lands that right hand. Woo. Still dangerous. It's still dangerous. Fucking 24 minutes. 24 and a half minutes in. Yup. Yeah. Good one. Yeah. He carries her fucking power. He'll switch it up to get you thinking about that overhand and come with that upper gut. Oh, we, y'all heard him? He heard him. Who was a stumble there, man. Damn. Jeremy Stevens is swinging a hate to see somebody lose a fight. Man. That's a great fight. Wow. Holy Shit. She's a great fight.

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       Look at these guys. Awesome. Fantastic fight. I love this too. I love this. I love these guys walking around, holding each others arms up. Yeah, amazing. Especially have to fight. And there was a moment of pause when the bell rang. We were still like, fuck you. Ah, goodbye. Because Jerry was chasing after a moving in for the kill and that last minute. Wow. Amazing fight. I still gave that last round to cub, but that highlights why, you know, it's like, what is that? Is that a ten nine round? Is that a ten eight what is it? Ten eight you know what the fuck? Why do we still have this 10 point system? It's fucking goofy. So what do you think you have to judge if you had to guess. I think cub did more damage. I would say cub. Yeah. I would say to Cobb as, I mean the problem is when you're looking at that whole 10 point must system is, is it going to be looked like that at the judges?

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       So it's same right now that that Jeremy broke his hand. Is that what they said? That's what it says right now. Dana White tweeted, oh, he broke his hand and the third round when or which hand? I was thrown both there at the end. So I was, I was trying to pay attention. He's so crazy. He probably didn't bother him at all. It goes numb. Yeah. Yeah. You don't want to feel it. He probably knew it and just kept bombing with it. I fuck, I mean I, I crushed my hand and broke my knuckle and like five pay up pieces and then broke my hand too. Impacted it and it just, you don't feel it. I mean it's not like I'm like fuck yeah, propane, you know, it's, he just went numb and I think I, you know, I threw a hundred and punches in the makeup show that fist make a fist.

Speaker 3:          00:25:18       That's where it goes. A little bridge right now. What's a little, a little swollen credit. I can land it in his fucking eye socket. And when you're training, what do you, what do you do to me your hands different with Boston gloves on it, it's, it's the padding's there so it helps out a lot. But if I still put it in someone's forehead or something or catch it on an overhand, which is how I broke it. A, it fucking hurts my fingers going to break like this. I mean it's, it's all fucking bruise right now, but you know, it's all right. Like it is here. It is.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:52       Cub Swanson. I thought it was just fun. Yeah, I think that's justified. I think it's justified in terms of the overall fight. Yeah. If you look at the overall fight, I think that cub Swanson one, the overall fight, definitely. Jeremy had some moments in definitely Jeremy scored a lot and had cub heard at one point in time, but it's a good fight, man. Yeah, really good. Yeah, that's, that's the kind of fight that you want to see when you see a guy who's fighting for a world title next. Yeah. He fights another top guy in the division to hungry young lions and both guys had moments. You know, Jeremy had some big moments in that fight, but Cobb had more moments. It's a big win for him, man. Yes. And

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       Jeremy Stevens being now the harder hitter. He, he stepped forward and landed some good shots. Cub had to do a lot of things to keep that pressure on. He didn't have that one shot power. You had to show a lot of accuracy through a lot of jabs mixed. A lot of kicks in there. A lot of head movement. He had to do a lot more cause he didn't have that power. Yeah. That's an interesting, I like seeing that person. Yeah, I do too. Well that's, that's a kind of fight to, that makes a guy really grow. That's some serious fucking experience you get there mentally. Just, just your fight Iq goes up fucking a lot of points. When you fought like w who's, who do you think is he? See Ian Mccall when you fought mighty mouse, when you fought Benevidez what fight? Do you have any fights that you look back on? He say that's the fight that really I took the most from.

Speaker 5:          00:27:30       Ah, I would say it'd be in Joe. I don't think either of us fought to our full potential and that fight. How come? I don't know. We just kinda stood there. We didn't really, neither of us move like we should have it didn't get after it, you know? Um,

Speaker 5:          00:27:46       you know, I'm pretty disappointed my UFC career, so I don't know. Are you willing? Yeah, no. Dude, you are a perfectionist. Striving to improve. Yeah. I should be world champion. That's not good enough. And I think that I, everyone knows I'm the only threat to Demetrius. Listen to you and you know it's I fucking molester than once on the ground. I'll do it again and get my fucking hands on you. I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I think that, you know what? I don't have the best pair of Jujitsu. I don't have the best pure wrestling. I don't have the best pure striking, but when it comes to getting in a fucking fist fight and having it end up on the ground, I'll fuck up anybody in my weight class. I don't think there's anybody who can do it. Want to scramble with me. You want to, you know, with, with submissions and shit like that and punches. I'll fuck you up. What do you think separates you? What do you think it is?

Speaker 6:          00:28:35       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:28:35       Oh Man. I don't want to sound like gene the bell too much, but I do the belt and I get off on it. You know, it's, it's, and it's maybe not as sexual as Jean Jean likes it to be, but I, I thoroughly enjoy fucking people up, man. It's always entertaining. I got a lot of pent up aggression. I like to perform. I think performing's become the biggest part. Just putting on a show. Yeah. And if, if someone's, you know, their wellbeing is at stake during that. I'm fuck, I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm not sorry. And what car do you on next? Uh, July 19th and Ireland. I'm fighting Brad Pickett finally. Finally fight. That's how you get your site in English, man. And I am in the name. Wow. I have a super gets, well, it's Gaelic, it's uh, you know, it's Irish, Scottish whales. I think it's a Gaelic is oh, your last name. Yeah, it's and we'll call you don't get any more Irish than that, but sorry, I'm not Irish. Yeah, they're going to be bummed out. Like put the fuck man. You confusing us. We want to route Irish and Mexican or something.

Speaker 5:          00:29:33       That's Hilarious, man. That's a good fight though. I love that fight. Brad pickets fun. He's a fun guy. He's, I mean we're, we're gonna, we're gonna get a bonus. Did picket fight flyway yet? Once it would be fine. Neil Neil, Siri, the Irish guy. Did he win or lose? He won but he looked like shit. Did he? Yeah, I mean he tough weight cut. I think that's what was a big part of it. And you know you're supposed to be a boxer and you get cracked and you'll turn into a wrestler, but I'm not going to get a Russell by an Englishman. Embarrassing. But I talk shit. But I got fucking taken down by a Brazilian so I've, I jumped into it. But again, I say stupid shit all the time. You're comfortable with saying stupid shit. Yeah, because it's entertainment, you know, I think people get buttered on Twitter that should I say and I'm like, motherfucker, you got a problem, you can text me or something.

Speaker 5:          00:30:19       I have some people that I know have gotten hurt. The Internet is filled with people that are not just bought her Lukey and to be butt hurt and I'm just playing the game. People have said the most horrible shit to me online. I mean with, with recent events, especially shit that had been said to me, I'm like, Jesus Christ, you guys are mean because they don't going to feelings. If I had a heart. Yeah. And this would really suck. Not just mean, but mean. And they don't even know you. Like, it's not like they're angry at you. They're trying to get back because you did something to them that they can't forgive. It's like, no, you don't have any relationship with them at all. They just reach out to you and just try to shit on you because the life is fucking misery ever met before because now you're saying some shit.

Speaker 5:          00:31:00       If you were in person, I'd break this fucking Mug over your head and stick it in the neck. You want to fuck me? I mean like what? What for what reason? Just to try to get just a rise out of you to ruin my day. Well, it's because response from you because they don't have anything going on in their lives. Gotcha. Rogan mad and he said something to me, it's a big deal to them. This is definitely true that that's, that's a fact. And that's a sure sign that you're a loser because that's something that winners don't do. I've always said that Michael Jordan is not leaving youtube comments. No. You know, he's not like shitting all over someone who's fucking video. You know what I mean? It's fucking song blows scope. The dining a fire, you know, that kind of attitude is almost always perpetrated by losers and it's just a matter of thinking a certain way that you will constantly chase down an Ian Mccall and shit all over.

Speaker 5:          00:31:49       I'm gonna try to hurt us feel and try to try to reach them online and try to eat, recognize me fucking scene. The Guy, he's a fucking supposed to be a comedian and he called that Louis C K for a fight to fight Louie who? Some fucking guy, I don't know his name, I don't fight Louis C K wants to fight him. And he called out me and he says, check this guy out, calling out Louis C K and I was like, oh. So I retweeted it and then I watched it and I was like, is that you? You're a fucking douchebag. Horrible piece of shit. And I'm sorry I fucking retweeted that. But like you're the kind of guy that I'm going to fucking spit in my hand and slap you in the mouth with it. Like so he's calling out Louis C K because Lucy Kay is doing well. Exactly. And then he calls me out. Oh who the fuck you're talking to? Like weird. And there's a lot of idiots out there but those idiots think that that's the way they can become famous.

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       That's the way they can get a name, you know, credit card. And he used to do the MMA uncensored show. He's all right. He is. Everybody hates the guy cause it's his, he's like a New York loud mouth like radio hosts and everybody hates him. And we were doing a shoot. I was on the show and he's actually a nice guy in real life and he goes, not one time with all the hate I get. Has anyone in real life in person ever said anything to me? I go, really? He goes not once, and he is hated. Not like there's some people out there that don't like you and me, Joe, I'm talking like most people don't like crit carton. He's liking them. Noxious and they don't. Most people I've talked to a litter MMA fans like you a lot. Oh, I think you do really well.

Speaker 4:          00:33:20       But yeah, there are some people that just get fucking universally, there's some people I talked to a lot of people that fucking hate Jon Jones, you know, they're talking to me about how John Jones is hated. All my friends hate Jon Jones. He's so fucking cocky. And I'm like, let me help you out here. Here's what's going on. You know? And I know that Jon Jones is awesome and that's one of the things that's bothering you. Is it? Jon Jones knows he's awesome. Does he do things that are debatable? Yeah, he got in an accident with a Bentley when he was drunk with a bunch of strip,

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       presume his car. Me like he was having a good time and have a night. You can't get a lot of us in that. So what are you mad at? You mad at the fact that he thinks he's going to win every fight. Guess why he won every fight. So he's driving, you know like what do you matter? I don't understand that. You mad that he's, he's ducking Gustafson. He wanted to fight Daniel fucking core me a Olympic wrestler. Undefeated both as a heavyweight and as a light heavyweight. A guy who's been running through people destroyed Dan Henderson. He wants to fight him and you think he's a coward. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. People are fucking stupid. Look the simple, the simple phrase of go ahead and explain yourself. Yeah. Tiers. Most people completely of, no, just tick that tick. Tick that logic a bit further.

Speaker 2:          00:34:31       I just want to, I just want to hear you express it. One piece at a time. All said everything falls apart. The other thing that fucks people up is the platform of being able to do like a Twitter post or a blog entry or you know anything where you're not addressing the human. A person's not challenging what Cannibal. Like if you're saying something, even if you're saying something to me, if you're not talking to Jon Jones, you're saying something to me that doesn't make any sense. I'll go, wait, hold on. What? I'll stop you if the first paragraph and go, that's not even true. That doesn't make sense. Well here's why. But instead they get to just buy through a whole entire blog entry and justify their thoughts or what unchecked and by the end of it, you know somebody reads it, they'll get angry, they'll have all these opinions on it, but it would have never happened if they were interactive.

Speaker 4:          00:35:21       There was an experiment at Stanford University where they put people in masks and had them shock people and that is that a control group or one subject didn't have masks on and they were behind this glass and they were shocking people. When they would answer a question, question certain way, then they took a group of will and put masks on them and did the same experiment and people would hit the button like incessantly. When there was, they wouldn't even ask a question. They would just shock them. As soon as they became anonymous, they will hit that fucking thing when they said the right answer when they didn't even talk in and they realize when you make people, and this is like 1972 and they realize when you make people anonymous, they will do horrible shit incessantly and well Susie, what mask on? They would hit the shock button constantly throughout the experiment.

Speaker 4:          00:36:05       Why do you think the KKK wore masks? People are shitty. People can be under the flushing shitty but also awesome. You know, people are pretty fucking awesome. I all, my favorite people are people. The way, the way I look at it personally, that's, that's a great statement. The way my favorite people or animals and throwing that out there. I know I like pets and shit. I'm going to monkeys and shit. My as monkeys do have shit and they do have shit and they fling it. My thing is like I like, you know, if I like something I'm a, I'm a reasonable normal human being and I don't like pickles and I liked the Pittsburgh Steelers. I've never gone online and talked about either one of those subjects. Most people didn't like something or don't want to just go, oh yeah. I'm like, you know, Jimmy Smith is all right. They're not going to get on a form and yell about me. It's the vast majority people that likes something and just enjoy it generally don't make a big deal, but we're talking about very slender part of the population that it's just loud, obnoxious about stuff. Yeah. No matter what you know, no matter what you do in the smart phone, right. Every asshole has a fucking voice. Now. Everybody's going to pin this thing about being anonymous. I must

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       be able to reach people. This is unprecedented in human culture. Yeah. It's never happened before, so people don't know how to fucking deal with it. They don't know how to manage it. It's just, it's not a ability that anybody's ever had in history. So this ability is something that it's going to take a long time for people to manage and use and I think what's going to change it more than anything is it's somewhere along the line we're going to lose it. Not anonymity. I think everyone's going to know who everyone else is. You're going to be accountable at the NSA. Yeah, it's gonna. It's exactly like if you were doing death threats to the government, they know who you are immediately. You could try to hide behind a proxy, but if you're, they're going to find you, they're going to find you really quickly and ultimately that kind of ability is going to trickle down to the common man.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       Everyone's going to have that. Yeah you do. And the world is going to know that you're a cunt for doing that too. Have you found out like you remember that reddit thing that happened a while back where there was a guy who would post all kinds of fucked up shit on reddit and he like like creep shots, like up skirt shots and stuff and underage shots and all these different weird creepy shit. And then they found out who he was in real life and they contacted his employer and showed him all the stuff that he put on line. They fire that fucking guy could well and the guy had like a wife and kids and the whole deal and you know like lost his job and he got outed on the Internet and you know, millions of people hated that guy after that. So many

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       people got ahold of the articles and retweeted things and Facebook didn't. It was a big issue, a big issue about freedom of speech and privacy but also a big issue about outing fuckheads. Yeah. Good. Fuck them. Yup. Yeah. Fuck them all. Fuck them all says Ian Mccall. Rimes and rimes. Really well. So a, the fights are over gentlemen. I guess the podcast is over to this has been a great time. Yes, this is, it hasn't been fucking fun. Three hours. We put this together this afternoon too. Yeah, I got a call this afternoon we doing tonight. Nothing Bro. What's going on and was like, I am there. I am there. Yeah. This is a lot of work on my seat, man. I'll be there and I really wanted to do with you too because I mean I don't know how many people know that we were really friendly with each other.

Speaker 2:          00:39:19       You know, despite the fact that we're supposed to be something we're supposed to knock, I guess we're supposed to be rivals. There's some shit are not going along with the whole Bjorn Dana thing. That's so goofy to me. It's what, you know when you, when I was talking to, I mean the way I see it is if there's a rivalry in UFC, in Beltour, at what level does that really happen? Like when I see Kenny are you, it's like, hey, what's like we're peers, we do the same job. We like, hey, how's it going man? We talked about fire to whatever and you know, I know you know a lot of the technical people that have worked on both shows and like they don't get along. It's not the director sees my director and starts a fight or something like fuck you. Yeah. Does my work that way.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       It's really good. You know? It's funny, I ran into some dude's last, a small like foster man. I love that guy. Yeah, great guy. He's a great guy. My boy, I love him. I ran into some guys last night that it just Jujitsu guys and we talked to Jitsu till two o'clock in the fucking morning. That's like when you run into someone who likes what you like and you start talking like, I mean I don't understand. I don't know. I've never understood that though. I've supported the people's podcasts, I've always supported other comedians. I just, I don't, I don't see that. I think the main competition is always with yourself and when you bring in someone else who's good or you have someone around you that's good and you have to compare yourself to them, I think it makes you better. So I think it's important.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       Every true, you see that a lot in MMA man. How many times you see guys that are training, they're in the same God damn weight class and they're, they're helping each other out and you know that one day they might have to fight like your riot and t and Tj Dillashaw after Uriah loses to hand Barao he says, Hey, you know there's a guy in my camp, I'd love to see him fight for the title next. I love to see him. See Tj Dillashaw. I get a shot. Same fucking way class beating each other's asses every day and still supporting him. That's the fucking, that's a brotherhood right there. That's where it's at, right? That's where it's not that big. I think that's what people don't get is community is not that big. No. We all know one another. At least. There's like two degrees of separation in this entire sport.

Speaker 2:          00:41:09       Maybe. How many of us are they? Not at, not a lot of us out there. Jason Chambers, who's a friend of mine who does a one FC. Yep. There's you who Smith who I fought Jason Chambers. Like it's just like there's only one degree of separation. This tire. You guys both had a TV show where you're traveling around and doing different martial arts. He did human weapon. I didn't fight quest. He keep called me. Send me a message. As soon as Fike was came out and goes, hey man, great. See on TV man, hope we get to the to hang out soon. I was like, Hey, good luck with your thing too bro. And like Jason's, it's like what we're, you know, we're gonna you know Jason, he's right over again. We already did one. It's ridiculous. It doesn't work that way. No. You know Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmerman, he had, I'm going to like to have a brawl traveling.

Speaker 2:          00:41:55       I mean, how many of us are there? There's now, there's a couple of fighters would do at Kenney. Brian Stand and Frank Mir used to do it until what? He said he wanted to kill Brock Lesnar in the ring, one of the houses to be the first MMA death in ring. Not Smart. Well not the smart, but still. I don't think it's like, you know, the guy's a great commentator who's nearly good. Yeah. I enjoyed his commentary, but I mean there's only the point being this may be 10 of us worldwide. I mean, I don't know who does that Indian promotion. They still have that Indian promotion superfly league or something. I know there's one bag for a little while. The Arab Emirates you at Uva, UAE. Um, one of my buddies is fighting out there soon. Is that a new organization? I think so. You know how much money they have to think of.

Speaker 2:          00:42:42       It's hard to think of any job or they're a few fewer people doing it, then it would make commentary. There are a dozen of us in the whole world. Like how many jobs are there? Yeah, there they're 10 of us. Yeah, no shit. [inaudible] CEO, there's, you know, several hundred. Yeah. Yeah. That was why we can run an inch with her into each other and talk shit, talk shop rather just what we do general. Yeah. How many of us are this is, that's it. That's interesting. Yeah. That's probably as far as others, like the two major promotions that anyone has seen, president of the United States is probably, you know, that's a singular biggie. It's a biggie when you run into former presidents, you're fucking but, but there's a former presidents as far as people doing the job currently, man. Yeah, I guess boxing commentators, but there's probably way more of them.

Speaker 2:          00:43:27       More boxing on TV too. Well they always do more guys to, like I was listening to some boxing last night and it was like, which I don't like in MMA. Yeah, but they do them in boxing. Well it can fuck up. Especially if you know you got too many people talking over each other when action happens or they don't like specific roles like especially when it comes to, I think you and I both do something very different than other sports too where there's a color guy and a play by play, but we both do play by play. We do color, but we also do play by play, especially when shit goes to the ground because the play by play guy doesn't really know what the fuck is happening. What they do a little, but you kind of have to do that. Well, you have to explain every nuance of the position and then start to explain what could be bad if this happens.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       And what could be good if that happens. Or women amaze the color medium. I, it's Jeff Blatnick who I love, Love Jeff Blatnick. He was, I thought it was a great, as a rescue is a great, great human being. Um, when he started doing color commentary for the UFC, it became a color medium just because if you, if you watch boxing, my mom knows what's happening in boxing match you d I mean they would ask Emmanuel steward little stuff and, or you know, it was George Foreman for awhile at Hbo and, but the play by play guy, that's the voice of Hbo is Jim Lampley Basically, um, with MMA color, guys have to talk a lot more because there's a lot more of the audience doesn't know the answer is never done Jujitsu. The answer has never done Muay Thai. The audience knows boxing a little bit. They'd never wrestled. So there's so many facets that the fans have just never been a part of that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:00       We have to break down and explain and I think it's made it, the color guys have to do a lot more than them. It made them, they do in boxing a lot more. Yeah, more. It's a completely different gig and that's also, it's also a, a gig that would be really cumbersome with a bunch of people talking if you had like three or four people in the booth. We've done three in the UFC before, but it didn't work that well. And Dana didn't like it and so they went back to two. Yeah, it's brief. The Times I've done it in Beltsville, they'll have like somebody jumped in for around it too. Yeah. I think what would be, yeah, I think we'll be cool as a guy doing the Harold Letterman Gig though, that Eddie Bravo used to do. Yeah. You know, Eddie's too busy these days. He wouldn't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       But someone who's like a real experienced guy, like uh, you know, that would be a good thing to do. Like to have like a dominant Cruz or you know, someone along that lines who's really good at breaking things down. It's very analytical. Give some, I think it would help give people some insight and also give some insight as to really what's wrong with the scoring. We could see if you've got a real expert at breaks down exactly what they thought about each individual aspect of the fight and then you see in contrast how shitty the the judges perceptions of the fight where, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:46:06       I'd probably say sign me up and I'd probably say some stuff

Speaker 2:          00:46:09       [inaudible] shit. Well, you know what I've liked and elected Josh Barnett has a blog now or has a podcast now. I think, you know, you'd be great at something like that too, man.

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       We've thought about it. I've had a few people kind of hit me up about it. We have a business called a direct endorsement where we do live streaming for only for an hour and we take an athlete, not just fighting, but fighting, skateboarding, motorcross, whatever it is. They pick a charity, we pick a product, say it's this Mug, everyone buys the mug. We, as we're doing that through the, you know, the, the, the podcast that person's signing while we're talking, asking questions, we get into what the charity is and it's just, it's, you know, like whatever percentage they want. Usually 20% goes to the, the, uh, the charity they pick. So that's very cool. It's a cool little thing we had, we only had three of them. We did myself. We did a quick, let's go for skateboarding and Kyle Loza for motocross and we'd like to get on the ball and start doing more. Might you Donal Logue for acting and just some, you know, just to kind of, just to hit different surfaces just because I don't have, I don't really hang out with fighters that much.

Speaker 2:          00:47:12       Yeah, no, that's interesting. So what, you only hung out with fighters from your training when you get outside of training?

Speaker 5:          00:47:17       Yeah, I mean, realistically I'm the hanging out people at the gym. If I'm not, not at the gym, I'm at home with my kid.

Speaker 2:          00:47:22       But a lot of people that are fighters find that they're the only people that understand them, that other fighters like it's such a crazy lifestyle

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       to the training. So brutal. The, it's almost like you need someone to commiserate with or you need someone who understands what you're going through. You don't feel like that. Um, I do, but I don't want to talk about it. I want to just fucking forget about it. I want to hang out with my, you know, with my kid and my girlfriend and her kid and just not have to worry about the fucking misery that I put myself through for, for, for greatness. You know, it's, it's a lot of fun. I love my job. Don't get me wrong, but I'd usually don't want to talk about it, you know, unless it's on something like this. So you're, you preserve your interest in it. Yeah, because otherwise, you know, I do. I've been watching more fights lately now that I, you know, meet me and my dad lived together.

Speaker 5:          00:48:08       That's a fucking all he does. And my daughter loves watching fights. That's hilarious. A two and a half year old, loves watching fights and she now, you know, she sees, you know, uncle Shane's on the TV, you know, this person's on the TV, this Romy, there's, you know, coach or whatever. It is cute. That is cute. Um, when you, when you're in between camps, like say like after a fight and you, you don't have anything scheduled for a while, how much time do you spend training and working on things and how much is just, just decompressing? I live a very active lifestyle. Like everything I do is outdoors. You know, I'm in Tahoe, Reno a lot, high altitude, so we're always going on hikes and I'm always doing, you know, high altitude beaker and with my girlfriend and w we just, she doesn't let me fucking sit still. Like she always has something to do with the kids are with me and her or fucking it. We've even for traveling, like went to Costa Rica for a surf trip. So we served him at jungle hiking and tried to find fucking Sloss and monkeys and shit. I know. So it's like, if she keeps, it keeps my attention going and, and I, I'm always fit. That's cool. That's a cool vacation. Yeah. Except for the diseases and the bugs that can kill you. See any of those. Everything wants to kill you down.

Speaker 5:          00:49:16       Yeah. I mean, it's not like you got to Hawaii. Like I went to Hilo and hung out with Bj and we went to Ypo. I'm looking around like, where's your bugs? Yeah, well there's fucking mosquitoes. But besides that, I'm like, there's nothing here that wants to kill me. Even the mosquitoes I think came from people. They brought him over on boats and shit. He's like, no bro, he's cool. No, we're just going to hang out. And if, you know, farm some farms from Taro. Okay. Bj has been there his whole life and still trains there. That's crazy. Yeah. We, we, we finished building the gym in Ypo, his little Dojo, I call it my Miyagi. And, uh, and then one morning I woke up, I was like, hey bro, I'm gonna go want to go bust the gym. Like, yeah, it's a great, grab your shit.

Speaker 5:          00:49:56       Let's go. And we just fucking drove the Ypo and it's got a sh, you know, little shitty old truck it doesn't care about and drives it through the river and it's got no, no, no. Uh, no electrical has been shorted so it's no, no, uh, no radio or anything. He just drives through the most fucking beautiful country you can. And then we go in there and we just beat the shit out of each other, you know, half an hour. We had some, some shirtless fucking hippie dude doing the time for us. He used to like wrestle and high school is, I'll stocking so we get, can you just tell us when five minutes is up? Okay. Ready? Go. How many live in Hilo have no idea. Not that, not that many, right. It's like 30,000 or something crazy because just the big island itself, not a lot of people live in the big eye on the big items.

Speaker 5:          00:50:36       Fucking huge. Yeah. I think the big island only has 100,000 people on it probably. And I mean it's, it's, it's desolate. And on the big island alone, there's like every single climate in the world except for like one or two. It's, it's, it's, there's so much going on there. It's so fucking beautiful. You look and feel like you're in Jurassic Park and especially getting to hang out with him. It's, he's a fucking savage man. It's a good time. What do you think about this fight with him and Frankie Edgar? He, like I said, when I was out there, this is a while ago, two months ago or something, he was 160 pounds. I got tired first and I don't, I don't get fucking tired. I mean, granted I just tore my hip and my groin, but I still don't get tired much. And he was, I still stayed in shape and I mean, he fucking, he was going after me for half an hour. Wow. And I was just like, after I was like, Oh, I'm fucking, I'm excited because he, it's my favorite fighter of all time. I mean, he's a fucking savage when you can make another man cry, another man who, who deserves a title shot at your title. And you can beat him up so bad that he cries and then you fucking lick his blood off your gloves and bang your head after I like, I like,

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       oh the Joe Stevenson place. The problem is on throwing the counter here is that he's always had trouble with fights where he wasn't on top, at least mentally. When the ball starts rolling the other way, it rolls bad. The momentum goes the other way for him. And so Eric is the guy you got to outwork and that's as it always been physical with Bj. It's when I'm not on top and I'm not dominating, when I'm not licking the guy's blood off my hands, I start questioning myself and I started rolling backwards and if he's got those mental demons in check, then he's got a great shot. Yeah, it's the same. Frankie Edgar always shows up and that's saint consistent, so consistent, so hard. Bj was so good when he's with the Marinovich bitches when he fought Diego Sanchez, he was in incredible shape. He had a fucking full six pack. I mean he was in shape and chasing after Diego deep into the fight. Fourth and fifth round going to hit him twice, doesn't it? Open, open. That was the only time Bj's ever thrown a head kick in a fight. Fucking landed perfect. Perfectly. You know, I mean that was a, that was him at his best because he had tremendous stamina. What do you know what he's doing now? Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:52:46       for strength and conditioning. I farming. Yeah. What are, what are we doing? And we're going to go farm manual labor. I don't need fucking strength conditioning. We don't need strength and conditioning. We just built roads in Ypo and fucking Farm Taro and beat the shit out of each other. Build the roads. We built like a fucking, and like with like a unum og, you know, like Mercedes Union mugs, you can put a fucking ditch digger on the back and like, I don't know what an [inaudible] is. A big, uh, like a tractor kind of vehicle. Big Mercedes unit. Mog All three of them out there. And he has a farm. Yeah, he's got a farm and you go into Ypo valley and it's, there's, I mean, not even a hundred people live there and it's this huge fucking garden of Eden. I mean it's massive and it's so beautiful and just there nothing there.

Speaker 5:          00:53:33       Is he growing weed? I wish I was he farming Tara. Tara is Tara. If you say quietly into a mic, they can still hear you should poops. Makes no difference. Bring it up. What is he was Taro? Taro is, they're trying to make it to try and make the Hawaiian superfood a Taro root and it's, it's, it's a really starchy, starchy vegetable that, you know, that's why Hawaiians punched so hard. That's what they tell me. Yeah. My first fight was in Hawaii. I had never heard a terrible before. How about how have I never heard of this before? It tastes like, like put like, like bland is fuck and put sugar in it and tastes like sugar. But it's supposed to give you superpowers. You know, it's, it's a matter before, I don't remember where, but I've had it before. What did you, what's your impression of it?

Speaker 5:          00:54:15       It's like a, like a, like a more bland kind of Yam. Yeah. This is the best way to describe it, Huh? Yeah, but it's super the soupy like [inaudible] gooey. Huh? Weird. They mash it up. I had it mashed up with something that was like a Tarot kind of stew. Is it supposed to be good for you? Like actually like that's, it's not supposed to be good for you. It's fucking weird and purple. That's a unit Mog oh, okay. So the, the local Hawaii. Does anybody else? He did. Is it anything that like, you know, everybody's eating like Bok Choy now is the new Kale. Everybody's telling you you got to get ahold of some Bok Choy but he eats [inaudible] in Hawaii. But Dino Hawaiians are fucking, they believe in like mermaids and shit. Brother [inaudible] and I love to death. Don't get me wrong. I love Hawaiians and like they're my favorite fucking people on the planet.

Speaker 5:          00:55:04       Like that's the only place I vacation. I lived with two fucking Hawaiians for, you know, I live with Shane and rich, rich who know rich. He used to run Strikeforce. He was mean match metric for Strikeforce and they're both fucking Hawaiian. And then I dunno, I just really like fucking lines. I tried vacation other the places. I'm like, this isn't as good as Hawaiian. Why am I fucking, I go anywhere. Well Hawaii's right there. It's going to Hawaii. It's cheat. Well kind of. She is still America but it's not, you know, it's like you're protected by the constitution to the alleged. Go to Bj's and go to have him take you to Ypo and you feel like you're in French Polynesia or something cause the people talking. You're just like all meeting income goal by some fees. You know, buckle around, smoke some weed bro. High School. And you're like, what did he just say?

Speaker 5:          00:55:46       Phrasebook that pigeon talking to Brian and Bj starts rattling off stuff and then you start drinking, you know like homemade sock aid down in the valley and then you just, it just turns into it, I imagine short food. Yeah. What plate lunches? Manchild food. How am I supposed to fucking make weight with this? This is delicious, but it's not on my diet. Yeah. I remember one of the, one of the countdown shows Bj when he was, uh, he had apparently burned off too many calories, he said, so it's time to load up. So we had one of those local Moco burgers with an egg on it and everything. And you get fucking get your, your, your Mac Salad and you're fucking chicken Katsu or, and it's just, they, you know, they're, they are island people. They're fucking crazy. And it's just so entertaining to hang out with them.

Speaker 5:          00:56:30       I just go out there and like, oh my God, okay, what are we doing today? Do you think you'd live there though? Yeah, but like Bj, I want to move to Reno, you know, and that's pretty just, you know, cause it's might be the only guy on the planet that wants to move to never heard, never heard in my life. And it's, it's fucking, you girlfriend lives there. Yeah. And we'll then move. Yeah. But it's, you know, it's wilderness enough where you're, I mean, you fucking seen Nevada parts in Nevada and you're like, where the fuck am I? Right. Yeah. There's parts of Nevada where they have crazy elk hunting. Yeah. Where there were bugling elks and you hear these elks like fucking 1200 pound beats come rolling over the hill. 30 and 40 of them at a time. Her cousins are all trappers and hunters, hunters out there.

Speaker 5:          00:57:13       They're like the two of the best young guys out there. Isn't that funny that people don't think about that when they think of Nevada? I think of only Vegas nuclear waste. The Safari Club is the biggest fucking incredible club in the credible nature out in the back. Yeah. Yeah. Oh well, especially up near Lake Tahoe is, it's fucking 7,000 feet and you go hiking and you go running and do whatever the fuck you wanna do. You get in shape quick. Yeah. And it's beautiful too. It's inspiring how beautiful it is, man. My, my grandparents have a spot right on the lake down there and it's, it's, it's fucking incredible. I mean it is so nice. And you know, I just pulling in grandma's yard and go, go down to the dock and just like, oh and plus my, no, my girlfriend, she's the face of Harrison Harvey's up there.

Speaker 5:          00:57:52       What is that? She's the big hotels up there. Oh she's, they pay her to just fucking stand around. Oh that's cool. So to sweet Gig, deep down, it doesn't suck. Isn't all meth down up there though isn't Reno? There's parts of Reno that is shit, don't get me wrong there. Knows Reno nine one one there. But like if you go to the [inaudible] out the mad cat hilarity like the free fun. If you go to the free fund like the river and people that blow up mattresses is going down and shit. But if you can just, you know, say that's hilarious and then kind of, you know, have your own life and do your own thing. I just liked seclusion. I'm I becoming more secluded and, and again back to like Bj has, he, he'll go stir crazy and then he'll go train over here. I'll go train in Brazil and he gets away and get away from your family and kids.

Speaker 3:          00:58:34       Yeah. Yeah. I think that also too, you live in a place in Orange County that is super congested. There's so many people came there. Yeah. I'm not a fan of that either. So when you go somewhere else, like take a a place where like Reno, which is just, especially at near Tahoe, where it's just all nature and beautiful and you feel like you feel it's relaxed, you're not stuck in traffic for 20 minutes, you're going to go two miles in 20 minutes. I mean, that's a, if you're in Vegas and you know you're, you're trying to go down the strip and you're trying to go from one in this trip to the other end on a Friday night, good fucking luck. You know, it might take you hours. Yeah. And that's, that's every day in Orange County. Every day. I mean, you can go, you can get traffic in Orange County at four o'clock in morning. Literally,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       I'm on another run into traffic. So I got here an hour early because I never know I was in fucking Irvine and I'm like, oh, I got to go now. Yeah, what? I texted you, I think it was like two in the afternoon. I'm like, I wonder if that's enough time for him to get out here. Yeah, seriously. Yeah, it's so fucking stupid. So you go to a place like Reno and you feel that that nature and you go, I could live like this though. Like why would I got fucking hot girlfriend I got, she got a cute kid, I got a cute kid and cost of living is super low and I, all I need is a nice little all wheel drive Subaru or something or an Audi and just hit that fucking Kingsbury grade while blah blah blah. Pop Up, pop up, you know, which you would you train up there?

Speaker 5:          01:00:05       Yeah, I would do my training camps down in, in uh, orange county still. But if I could just get away and I mean there, there is Jim's up there. What does their high level gyms? There's a, there's a reno or Nevada Moy Moitai, which is I think the best gym up there. Um, and they have Charles Gracie Jujitsu. She, they've got some good black folks. Nice. And that's all in Reno. Yeah. And then when the people live in Reno, uh, it's getting bigger and it's getting, I mean like the food's getting really good really? And yeah, there's, there's, and every, you know, my girlfriend, like I said, it's kind of the face of the area and she's always around other hot. That's what I get to see it get to see hot women all the time. She runs a promotional company, so it all makes sense now.

Speaker 5:          01:00:44       I understand. I want to read, I didn't get it. The cat, the caliber of ask that comes out of her, even her little town of [inaudible] is fucking incredible. I'm like, wow, this place is great. That's interesting because I think it's biased of course. But I think, I've never been to reno, but I think of Reno, I might've been the arena, but I don't remember it. But I think of Doug, Stan hope recorded a CD there once because Doug likes to go to fucked up places and record things like he, he did one of them in Oslo, Norway, like, oh I fuck do that. They barely even understood what he was saying. He, but he recorded his first CD and a v Reno and the voice that's chalked off on a list of places I don't need to go to and listen to that CD. I'm like, yeah, I don't need to go there.

Speaker 5:          01:01:25       It's changed very recently where it's becoming cool. It's becoming kind of Portland dish, but minus the fucking Douchey. Let's save the world kind of Shit. It's like, when did that happen? Recently? Super recently. I how many years? Past five years maybe. What caused it? People probably realize that people realize that we're fucking everything up and we're douchebags and everyone's like, okay. But it's, it's just, it's so outdoorsy and it's so, it's, it's still got the fucking casinos and they're just trying to be, become nicer. But uh, there's always something going on. There's only other guys I know that lives in Reno is a, my friend Remy who's a, he's, there's a show called solo hunters. Yeah, well he goes hunting biopsies of a guide and he's kind of famous hunter and he uh, they, he goes by himself and just brings like these cameras and Gopros and shit and films everything and then edits it all together. It was crazy, crazy hunts and he goes on, I want to kill something with a sword. I cause that is but not

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       likely. You're really good with a sword. Yeah. I got a black belt in San Suu when I was younger. Kung Fu Sensu so I was just, it was just go with weapons. He was all like threat strokes in growing, growing shit and like I was just good with a weapons. Have you ever like put on the Kendo gear and done that? No. It looks fun. It is. What? I'm going to beat the shit out of each other with pillows on your body. Well I think it looks like you're the of sticks. Yeah. Yeah. David Lee Roth moved to Japan and he practices Kendall all day. He does Kendo every day. Cause he's David Lee Roth. He said he's a gangster. He's fucking awesome. David, Dave Dude. Fucking high kickin and shit. Took his dog. Yeah, it took his dog got on a fucking plane at like what? 60 is he 60 moved to fucking Japan.

Speaker 3:          01:02:59       He's taking Kendo lessons. It's under some great fucking Samurai warrior character. They tried to do it for five West. That was one of the ones that we, they tried to do and apparently the association is unbelievably strict. Real. It isn't like, oh we have our Kendo school. We do what we want. No, it's like the hierarchy's very, very rigid and they were like, no, fuck. I just want to, I want to pick to run at me and just soon and then just have it slide. Yeah, that was being in the food. You not want to pick to run those mother fuckers. When we were at a to hone ranch when I was pig hunting, they had a skull from this one really big board that they killed. It was a 450 pound boar and the fucking teeth were like two fingers and they were sticking out like this.

Speaker 3:          01:03:39       He's taught us and that they would tell you that they run by you. They just run at you and literally tear at the side of you. With these tusks, they use these tusks almost like as remember those carts as chariots. He said those wheels blades, tick it off of him. That's what the the hogs do. They run by you and you'll see this will fuck you up. They will fuck you up. Let rethinking my idea. Yeah. Don't want to, you don't want to sort of always best with the rifle. Yeah. Rifles. The moon bone Arrow is good but are very, there's a very small window to get a board with a bone arrow down with the fucking spirit. Difficult. Well, they have difficult a Oregon's to reach and they also have an incredibly dense upper body, like their upper body, the, the thick skin around their neck and Cape.

Speaker 3:          01:04:21       It's like, it literally is like some sort of a like a shield that they're wearing. Like we touched a when, when I was in camp there was a, I killed a female pig, but there was a guy that killed a big boar and they were explaining to me, this is why like shot placement is critical when it comes to archery, like touch this and it's like a saddle, like a, like a, like a horse saddle. That's what it felt like around the neck. And because they're constantly cutting each other up and fucking each other up so they have like this thick meat all around their body. Can you do eat that meat or is that just the shock? Yeah, I was gonna say it's got to be good. Well the pork is very good for especially smoked. I smoked a ham and I'm telling you, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten.

Speaker 3:          01:05:00       It was delicious and super healthy, much healthier than a pig that you'd be getting a grocery store because these pigs are just eating egg corns and there they're running around, they're real muscular. So there it's like a dense rich, dark protein. Super good for you, man. Meets all oxygenated and fucking, if you wind up going up to Reno, you'll get a lot of elk cause there's a lot of elk up in Reno. There's a lot of people that have, you know, a lot of hunters up there. I'm sure you can probably buy it up there too. Yeah, I would want to go kill it myself. I would just go with, with my girlfriends, cousins, they fucking, that's their thing. They, I, I want them took me fishing over the winter and out to the rivers. You know, we just, he's like, yeah, throw it there and I missed, don't wanna throw it right there.

Speaker 3:          01:05:37       And I missed again. He's like, give me that through it in the spot and kind of fish. Did he see it or you just know where the pool was and mean? He's like, and we're driving by and he's like, we're driving from the highway and it's a hundred feet down to see the ribbon. He's like, oh, you see the fish coming up? I'm like, no man, he's driving. Yeah, we're driving this train station, the road bitch. She's like, you see that? I don't fucking put your fucking eyes off the river. I'm like, I don't know man. So we went down there and he, he just, wherever he tells you to put it, if you can live, once you landed in that exact spot, you pull in a fucking fish and like how many times have you caught that fish? He'll look at it and be like, Eh, maybe not this one.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       I don't know. And then like he's like, I've seen fish with Talon marks on them that I've caught before. Talon marks from an eagle funnels up and Rhea. Oh fuck yeah. There's a bunch up down in that area. Wow. I've seen like 10 in one spot and in Tahoe. No Shit. My [inaudible] said my grandparents haven't had spots all over the lake, but like right on the lake. So you just sit in their backyard and the fucking in the winter especially cause it's all white, you know, you can just see these big fucking birds. I saw my first live eagle last summer in Alaska. Really credible, credible Alaska is fucking amazing. Flew over our boat. Me and my friend Ari Shaffir. We went up there fishing and we did a gig up there. Fucking had a great time. But when we're uh, we're taking the boat to the spot on the river, he's fucking eagle flew over our head is huge eagle.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       Just big ass fucking legs and shit tucked up. It's not a big fuck you man. It's such big birds to fucking snatch you up and take you home looking for the same shit. I'm looking for trying to steal some salmon. They're so big and there's so many of them. You see them up there. The people say they're like pigeons. Like they think of them as like pigeons and nuisance bird. The American Eagle caught dammit. Dammit. Our national birds of nuisance bird. That's a problem too because if it got, if they got so overpopulated they would never get so overpopulated in America or doubt. I mean Alaska is not really America, it's kind of America, but whatever other Russia. But if they got down here and the got that over populated and they started like stealing cats and shit problem, like people might be an issue like the wolves now do in my neighborhood.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       I have a problem with owls. I don't have a problem with owls, but you know my problems and our problem. No, cause they'll fuck up some cats. Like if you leave your cat outside the and the owl catches your cat slipping the little fucking swooped down. Owls. People don't think of owls as being like vicious predators. They are. They're ruthless. Hallberg big owls are big. I had an album on my back porch is motherfucker was three feet tall. It was like this tall. There's sitting there. I'm like, God damn. I didn't know owls with that big creepy fucker was backwards head. What else I want time to next. There was a four foot, four and a half foot beating the shit out

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       of my sister's dogs here. This cheese Mac and the shit out of Ge. Yelping I'm like, I had to go out there and save my sister's dog. Do it. Recognizable fucker. Oh good. You issued their fucking vicious. Have you ever seen a video of Kevin Rose? He's from a, what does that, what does he from dig from Digg dot. Kaiser. He created dig and his dog was getting attacked by a raccoon. So he picked a raccoon up and they got it on security camera, picked a raccoon up and threw it down a flight of stairs. But it's pretty fucking gangster. The way he does it. He grabs a raccoon bites back to see if he can find it, see if we could find it. He's got it. And your rabies walk. Rabies just loved his dog so he just fucking did it. You know, he just had to do it and this is, you had it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       Oh Shit. That's so the, he runs up to the Rep. Isn't that crazy thing. Look at that. Thinks leg and twirling fucking balls, man. He's got balls do cause he didn't like try to underhanded. He brought it behind his head. He fucking hated that raccoon. That guy's bad ass. They will fuck your pets up if you are not careful. That is wild man that he did that. Meanwhile the raccoon probably walked it off like it was nothing. This is my dog toaster crying and yelping and pain. I discovered a raccoon attack. Him. I do not occur. It encourage animal violence. I want to get the wild animals far away from us as possible. Toasters. Okay. But it has some bite marks. Look at it. There's a dog and the raccoon are going at it, man. And he sees that shit and he just runs up and grabs that motherfucker and whips.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       It runs after it. Bad motherfucker. Kevin Rose is a bad motherfucker that is gangster, but it looks like he owns a poodle. I'm just throwing that out there. A little count. I'm not even sure if he's straight. I'm not even sure if he's straight. So you know, whatever, whatever. He went after that record and after he threw it, he said, fucking crazy prick. That guy's a mad man. I ticked that raccoon. Turn them into a hat. Oh done deal. Stomp on his little head. And my dad's from Kentucky. He was hunting since he was like three. He's eaten everything. He is in the woods. Oh a million times. Raccoons, squirrels, snakes, all kinds of shit. I beaver when I was in Wisconsin and I don't mean what you think. [inaudible] I got a, I had a beaver. Stu, Steve Rinella a he slow simmered a beaver. He caught a beaver. Killed. It turned its mitten. It's a body and a mittens. Saw that on your Instagram. The same beaver. I ate some of that beaver. It was really delicious. Yeah. Tasted good. Tastes like beef. Like, like, like a beef pot roast. That's what it tasted like. Man. I hate I have eaten. No, no, no. I will eat anything.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       Like I will eat anything. And my dad, he did eat things that I will not touch and my mom, he thinks like I have parents that are even worse. I'm know for reading anything like balloon in the Philippines and you know, it's, I mean all kinds of shit doesn't really, I don't, doesn't bother me. I refuse to eat what I drink is holding a turtle blood one time. Yeah, it was like a thing for the gym. Like really? When I fuck Yoka Shin, they said it's a thing in our gym first they gave me a curry. That was so, it was the hottest thing I've ever eaten and I like spicy food. It burned from like the moment all you could feel what all your intestines where like it when all the way through my intestines burning everything and I just kept eating it and other guys reading and they were meditating.

Speaker 4:          01:12:01       They had towels on their heads like blocking out the pain and they're crying and stuff and I'm eating it. I'm just mad. It's fucking hot. And I just kept eating it and the instructor turns to our translator and goes, ah, that is some shit in Japanese and the instruction that Translate Trans People's, you're very tough. A lot of people pass out. I'd have to go to the emergency room like a lot of people die. They were like, what? They have to pump them or they'll die. It starts burning and I was like, are you fucking kidding me? And I finished it. I May 8th of thing. How's your ass? Oh my goodness.

Speaker 4:          01:12:35       That's a great question. I don't even think about that. Burned on the way out. It didn't burn as bad as it did on the way down. Like it was burning like, oh this is uncomfortable and not, Oh shit, I'm in big trouble burning. And then the next night we went to this old school Sushi place in the middle of Tokyo and they have a thing where it's like a, a Mug, like a beer Stein full of turtle books. Do you have this turtle soup? And they put the blood in this thing and they usually mix with alcohol, but I don't drink. So they had to mix it with some kind of juice and they mix it all up and like here you go. And I'm like, all right. And I drank this whole mug. It turtle blood man, just chugged it. Tire Stein of turtle blooded, Chug the whole thing.

Speaker 4:          01:13:13       How many ounces? Like 1216 year mug. Like a Beer Stein to like 20 feels a lot. Like it was a while. Yeah, it was a lot. And I just chugged it, man. I was like, all right, here you go. And sit it down. So he's like, it actually wasn't bad. It wasn't that strong. So it tasted like whatever. It looks like an apple juice or something. It's usually put booze in there and I won't drink. So they had a like apple juice mixed with the turtle blood and tasted more like apple juice. So I just drank the whole thing. Oh, so it wasn't bad at all then? It was actually show me, no I didn't. I didn't think the blood tastes was that strong, but I'm sure it would gross out a lot of people that couldn't get through it. I didn't really care. Your mouth was still burning from the fucking yeah, from that curry.

Speaker 4:          01:13:50       I didn't tell you shit man. That was the deal. They put, they just hated us pretty bad on that shit. They cut out a lot of it on the show was because you could only fit so much in the TV show. Like when I went to Gracie, who? Martha in Brazil, I fought everyone in the room for three and a half hours, Wah. Okay. By the time I was done, I was like that Gabe written over my face like, and no, we're dealing, you know, 15 black belts. It wasn't like how many times did you tap? I don't even remember because the first 45 minutes I'm doing fine. And then after that you just bought. It just starts giving even out on you and they don't stop and they're all, and then I look around and I realized that nobody else is fighting but me, I like, I'm waiting and they're all waiting on the mat just to face me.

Speaker 4:          01:14:34       And so I'm just riding the snake for three and out. Three and a half hours. That is some annoying shit when you see it sitting there waiting to roll with you and he's not rolling. He's waiting for you to get tired. And then as soon as your turn is up, the bell rings and then he's like, you want to go? And you're like, what are you been doing for the past 10 minutes? Imagine a whole class full of that guy. And I mean, like I said, 15 black belts and it wasn't, I mean this is the original Gracie academy. It wasn't like a bunch of chumps here. I mean these guys were amazing. It's good as it gets. And the next day I came in and they did the exact same thing to me. Oh my goodness. I couldn't, I wasn't moving great by the end of that.

Speaker 4:          01:15:08       And then I got not food poisoning. They made me swim out in Ipanema beach. They want a shot of me swimming and they said, okay, we want you to swim from here to here. And I went, all right. And then that night I got sicker than I've ever been in my whole life. The sound guy got sick listening to me puke. He was like, he was holding the mic going like he got sick. He literally got sick listening to you, you get sick because I was shitting in puke and like from the water and your mouth, those fathers, they had me swim where the favela runoff goes. Nobody told, like the producers didn't research anything. They just said swim from there to there because it would look good. I went, all right, fine. Well that's fucking Brazil. And I went to go. I went, yeah, I swam out there and the the local looks at me and he goes, you can't swim out there.

Speaker 4:          01:15:56       That's where the favela runs off. And I went, ah, and they go, no, no, no, you can't swim up there. He goes, American, Nah, you can't swim out there. And I'm like, Oh shit. That's why I got so sick. You swam and Favela Shit. And the next day I had to fight the guy for the final fight and fight quests. And I, I remember standing there and I was so sick that I was sweating. You know, you're so sick, you're swaying like you can't stand still. And I was swinging around and because they wanted footage to cut, I fought the guy for 2024 minutes. Oh my. Like it wasn't like a seven, you know, I was a pro bowl at the time. It wasn't a seven minute match. That is two or three times. So, and this guy was like, he was amazing. Not only was he really good, I was sicker than a goddamn dog, so it was just terrible.

Speaker 4:          01:16:44       So that happened a lot. Like there are a lot of things, it just didn't make the cut. There were like, that sounds like, oh, that's the show. It was rough. Man. That's the problem with having a show. It's got to be an hour. It's got to fit between this time. Like no, it should be fucking hours and hours long. He should have to watch all of it. Yeah. Just watch what I mean, that sounds like a lot of entertaining shit went down a lot of stuff. I mean it was cool man. It was an experience of a lifetime doing that kind of stuff. I would have liked to seen those video of the guy telling you that that's where the favela runoff goes. I was so knowing that you were sick, doctor Brazil and I was like, no, it was when I was, I'd gone back to, I trained with Nova neon Donna Brazil.

Speaker 4:          01:17:19       Oh, on that trip. And uh, I was just down there for vacation. I did an m one show and decided to stay for a few weeks. And uh, yeah, I went back to that beach and a local set. No, no, you can't swim out there and shit. Water. Like fuck. They missed that. I got so God damn sick. It was horrible. Yeah. That's not in, yeah, probably. I was in the emergency room in Rio and I can't, I was lying on the floor cause I couldn't sit up and a doctor came by and said, get him in a room right now and I'm in an emergency room in Rio. So it wasn't like, you know, I'm out in the middle of nowhere. Like this is it packed emergency room in a major city. And they went get him an emergency room right now. Get him in a room, getting my next day, the next day. God Damn. Oh God. It was all it was. I felt like ass, you should have just shit all over. What I did, I kept my cabby bubble buttle clenched up and kept rolling, man. You know, that sounded like it was a fun show to do though. It was, it was a blast to do. It really was. It really was. It was, um, it was just the disconnect between

Speaker 4:          01:18:27       the, the people who made the show, the producers and everything weren't fighters. They weren't martial arts didn't understand anything. And, and right, so Doug got, when are we doing Kilcoyne in Japan. He got concussed so badly. He didn't, he couldn't see out of his eye. He had a hemorrhage behind his eye and he couldn't see out of it. And, and they, they would go to me and go, well, what do you think's wrong with Doug? And I go, I'm not a medical professional. I can't, you know, his knee was like grapefruit sized or like a melon sized. And they were like, what's wrong with him? And I go, I, I'm not Dr. Smith. I go there like nine things that could be wrong and to create those symptoms. He needs an MRI. And they went, oh, he'll be all right. And he fought like they didn't, this wasn't, they weren't staff reginae they could've been anything, but they did these warrants sanctioned athletic events.

Speaker 4:          01:19:11       So they didn't test. If we were, if we could get out there and fight, we fought, that is up. They just didn't have any, that's the problem with reality to is there's no, you know, I remember, you know, a pretty, she doesn't know like is that safe? They don't know. We shot on the edge of the volcano one time and there are all these signs going, like there's, there was, there was a, uh, like a guard rail to keep it from going out with this poisonous gas. Well, the camera guy goes, I'd be great shot if we got out there and this is in Indonesia. And he just turns to the, the guy, the ranger and says, can we just go, we're just gonna go right out there. Just is that cool? And the guy just kind of threw his hands up on, yeah, go ahead. And he goes, and then, so we went out there and he goes, all right, well how about that one? And so we did the shot and I turned around and we are

Speaker 4:          01:20:00       60 yards behind. Do Not Cross poisonous gas. Don't go over this slide. And the camera guy, it's about talk to his dude into letting us get all the way out there. And the guy starts talking and our trans or turns to us and goes, yeah, there are rivers of poisonous gas around where you're shooting if you fall, that's it for you basically. And I'm like doing stuff on the top of this mountain. And they're like, yeah, if you follow that, that's it for you. And the producers don't give a fuck. They do not. It's good for the show. God Damn it. Get your ass out there and do it. That's the attitude of reality TV. So it was this combination of fighting and reality TV. So it was, it was interesting because they don't know that. And I had to go, hey, Doug needs a concussion check.

Speaker 4:          01:20:42       And they went, well, how do I go? Or I said, we need concussion checks after we fought five guys in the CALC isn't final. I said, we need concussion checks. And they said, well, how do you know? I said, listen to me, I just fought five guys in a row. I, you know, I'm telling you we need to get checked out to make sure we don't have a concussion. And they're like fighting me on it. And I went, look, we need to go to the restroom when we need get concussion checks. We both got kicked in the head, they were fighting, you'll fine. But I, the whole point is I shouldn't know the difference. You know, if a guy's telling you doesn't he concussion check, it needs to concussion. So they went and they took us there and Doug blew his nose because of blood in his nose and his cheek starts blowing up like a balloon.

Speaker 4:          01:21:19       He had cracked or orbital bone and so air was getting out through his cheek and so he goes, is there something wrong in my cheek? And I hit it. I pushed it and it was going like a rice krispies cause there was air, air, air bubbles in there. And I went, I think you cracked your own little Barb wrote. It's like, Ah Shit. Okay. And then we fought again in like 10 days were in another country, the same shit. It's taught again with a broken orbital. Two days later we had 10 days between shoots. That's exactly. So that's when we started the next one down. Tough fuck man. I was just our lives man. How old were you then? I turned 30 during the show, so I was 29 for most of it. So you were young enough to be talked into something really fucking stupid.

Speaker 4:          01:21:59       But I also, but also like defensively, like the pro Doug really got beat on my, my, my cohost on the show because I have fought professionally when I'm in deep shit in the show, I would put my hands up and move my head and, and you know, I've been around the block enough to know that when I was outgunned I was fighting a heavyweight. Okay. If I can cover up, cover up and not get hurt straight defense, he had no idea how to do that and would just get hammered. When I was living with his background, none, he was a, he was a military guy. He had been, he had been in Iraq and, and had been a bodyguard in Iraq and had done some amateur fights. So he just didn't have the wherewithal to go, you don't, when you're fighting six guys, I'm going to make it look good for three of those guys.

Speaker 4:          01:22:39       And then for the rest I'm slipping and moving and you know, I'm, I'm working on my, using my defensive skills. He didn't have that skill set. So when the water got too deep, he would just get hammered and hammered and I'd have to talk to producers and go, you can't. One time we were in Indonesian and he's a real jovial guys, a lot like use those jokers, smaller guys who he's funny and he was just depressed, like to the point of like he wasn't the same dude and the producers went, what's wrong with Doug? And I said, he's getting beaten up every fucking week. You can't put him through this physically and mentally every week. Like these starting to break down and we're, I'm like, week six, whatever it was. I go, he you, you can't, it's like at the gym, like when you get hazed. Yeah, that's fine. If you hate the guy every day for a month, he starts just fallen apart or you, you can't, I mean every good coach knows that like you put, you go with guys or higher level, but there are certain point you don't give him those, give them those times where he's feeling good and if you don't have those, you start breaking down. And Doug started just breaking down. Well there's also right,

Speaker 2:          01:23:43       your whole system gets fucked up cause of head trauma bad. That's what they're finding now and out mad about head trauma. Head trauma to a tear gland just doesn't produce the chemicals needs when it gets smashed by a Shin kick, it just doesn't work. The ranch is the big argument about this TRT shit cause they're saying if these guys need TRT thing wrong cause they're getting kicked in the head all the time, it's either that or steroids or there's a medical issue on top of that. So how many people have that medical issue? It's a small percentage. Most of them. Hypo Gandy, isn't it? Yeah. Going at a homeowner, either. Most of them see their steroid abuse or they've getting hit in the head too much or weight cutting. Weight cutting is a big one too. I had, I had a doctor telling me, he goes, no functioning athlete should need TRT.

Speaker 2:          01:24:28       He's like, if, if you need TRT, something's wrong. You've been, your endocrine system is screwed. There's something that's happened to fuck you up. Uh, apply. Matt, you shouldn't be thinking about TRT therapy until you're like 45 50 until you're literally not, you know, I'm not preaching of Sergeant, I'm getting too old. It's like a prime athletes shouldn't have that on. The only doctors I've talked to you have given me, they said, shouldn't happen if you're that age unless something's wrong. Yeah. There were guys in the UFC that had in their 20s yeah. What, what? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe like Antonio Silva because he's got, he's a very extreme example. This is a special case period. Yeah. It makes sense that he would need it. But you know, it's, it's a fucking, it's just such a crazy situation because they let it through for a while. Yeah. You know, so we've got, Oh God, the guy like Chael Sonnen is kind of like the canary in a coal mine and he's kind of like one of the first guys you know, and had the issue after the Anderson Silva fight, we said, they said it was clear but it wasn't cleared and almost won the title and then was suspended for a long time and then came back and then failed that test and then failed this new test. And so, but the problem with this new test,

Speaker 6:          01:25:44       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:25:44       if the last test he had that obviously was things to deal with the TRT therapy, what I've read and the argument is going to be how does this affect his legacy and that he had in that,

Speaker 6:          01:26:00       okay,

Speaker 2:          01:26:00       did he retire because he knew he had pissed off of this other test. Didn't want that, but come on

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       public and you know, it just raises all these questions about, well he's on all this other stuff. He knew he took the test already. The one in Oregon was he retiring because, oh man, I pissed off for this one to you and try and get out. I mean it just castle, there's a serious doubt on his, his legacy. When you throw him the, the new tests it got announced today. That's huge. Okay. But do you could question vandelays legacy? Uh, a little bit. I mean, we're all sitting here talking about when Vandelay was at, his best motherfucker was juiced beyond. Oh, and we're, we're sitting here talking about man, when Vandelay was at his best, he was a walking pharmacy. We're assuming that, but that's legacy. When you see Vandelay Silva, Joe, what do you think of this roided out beast killing people in prime. Different time. Different time. But it's still what we're thinking about. It's still in our head. It's still part of the conversation we just had about a prime mentally involved pharmaceutical products. That's legacy. Yeah. You got to knowledge. It is, it's what you talk about. It's still my favorite. Yeah, exactly what it, man, I'm put my bitch Vandelay fan till the day I die. I love the guy to death. But like I said, when you say legacy, yeah. You're thinking, what do I think of when I think of that? No, absolutely. It's true.

Speaker 3:          01:27:18       I mean, look, it's something that has to be considered. And with jail, you know, there's more than one situation, more, more than one instance of it. So it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a part of his legacy, but I think Chels legacy ultimately is going to be more of a self promoter then even if a fighter, I mean, he's, I think he's the best shit talker ever by far. His mouth, his bronze. Fucking, he's the greatest. I love his shit. Talking and it made him, I mean, you think about he has a victory over shogun. Huge victory submission. When the Anderson fight, the first one, very close fight gets submitted in the final round. I mean, there's a lot of good moments in his career

Speaker 4:          01:27:58       leading up to the Anderson Silva fight. I remember he'd beaten Nate Marquardt was a great fight, great fight. Uh, he'd beaten, I want to see, you should know comedy before that. Yeah, he'd be, yeah. Decisions. I mean, you know, had he, he'd be, I remember not thinking he had much of a shot. I remember thinking, oh, those are good ones. Good solid guys. But they weren't blowouts. He didn't destroy those guys. They were decisioned wins his mouth. Sold that fight. Yeah. I don't remember a lot of people thinking before he started talking that he had a great shot. His mouth made that fight. I've heard from more than one person that they were worried that Anderson Silva, cause remember he had fought tail slate, this, this goofy, weird fight. The Damien Maia fight. Weird kind of fight that Dana was furious and Anderson Silva and they were worried about him putting his fight like on an undercard who's was threatening put on a car.

Speaker 4:          01:28:50       I don't know how real that is, but chill went fuck it. I gotta sell this thing. And that's when the mouth came out. Cause he hadn't really done that before. Yeah, it was through that fight that all came out. And his teammate, one of his teammates or his old coach told me, he goes, they were worried Anderson Silva vs shale was going to be on an undercard cause there's other performances have been so weird that they were going to kind of punish him. So that shale went, fuck, I got to sell this thing and just started running his mouth off and made a fight. That on paper I don't think was super compelling into like must see TV. And then it became, and then it became a thing. You can, the problem with the character, and I tell this to fighters all the time, if it's not you, be careful.

Speaker 4:          01:29:30       It becomes you. If it's not you, if you aren't comfortable, may him. Miller became a dude. Mayhem became a person and you to be a nickname when I first met him. Now it's a guy, it's an amalgam I gotta be. And it's like if you aren't comfortable being that guy, please don't start because you can't just stop. Imagine not wanting to be Hulk Hogan. And when people come up and go, hey, you have to be hokey. He can't be whatever his name is newer right now. You can't not feed that back. I can't not be that guy, so I tell fight. I was like, Oh, be careful with that shit. That's once you start, you cannot stop. Ultimate warrior died. The ultimate [inaudible] in his mom's basement. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:30:20       seriously, can't just turn it off that aren't, she can't go, you know what? I'm really sick of this stick. These kids got to be that guy or else don't start. Don't create a character to to hyper fight and for the rest of your life you are a whole Cogan or you're the ultimate warrior or you're some character you don't believe in because it won't go away. That is hilarious. We'll talk to you and be disappointed that man, you're pretty normal. I'm just, one of the things that that really I really liked is that people, fans, a Fike was met me and went, wow, you're not that different. Like you're not any different. Like the show is just you doing stuff. People who see my commentary and meet me in real life go, well, you're not any different really. I don't have to create a guy that I have to be when people come up and I've got to be fight question me.

Speaker 4:          01:31:07       Like I don't have to be that guy. Bobcat Goldthwait struggled with that forever. Bobcat for the longest time, you know, he, his comedy act, who would do that? Like he would delivery it and then after a while, I mean it was hilarious, but after a while he got tired of fucking doing that. He, his, he had a great comedy DVD called is he liked that all the time. Do you remember that? Bobcat Goldthwait is, he liked that all the time. And he's a really, really smart guy with, you know, insightful things to say about stuff. But I don't think he does that at all anymore though. Now he's just, he's allowed to be himself now, but people, it took, there was a transitionary period after he's been on the podcast for, he's great. I love him. He made a big foot movie, man. Really? Yeah, a horror movie. It's good. Let's coming out soon. We're going to have a,

Speaker 2:          01:31:59       um, some sort of a release party. I'm in where we you want to go? Shit. Alright. Bobcat Ian and I were in bravo be a screening somewhere. I'll let you guys know when it, when it takes place. But uh, Bob, I seen, I've seen it already. It's really fucking good. He had a really good big foot movie. It's called Willow Creek. That is not easy to pull off to a really good big Gary. It got 93 on rotten tomatoes, Asca, 93 fucking percent on rotten tomatoes. That's huge. Or I am db one of those things, whatever it is. But it's, it's good. It's like a Blair witch style filming. Like these people that went out looking to make a film about a big foot and then they, you know, they pieced together this documentary based on their unedited footage. It's fucking good. That's crazy. Yeah. Bob, he's a big believer in big fun man.

Speaker 2:          01:32:47       I wish big. It was real. I show two. That'd be so awesome. I have a theory that if he's real, he has to be gay. That's why there's only 10 of them. Otherwise they'd be everywhere because no one's eating big foot babies. Who's he? Who's keeping them from bring days? Wait too much logic for most people because most people when you start talking about you don't, you need a breeding population of something. They look at you with this blank stare and you go, there has to be enough of them to have genetic variety and have babies. This makes sense to anybody. There's not one big foot one. Oh, you course you can find, but you can cut me in population. Who's then the Pacific northwest. It's so vast, so it could be thousands of them. I believe there's about 10,000 Sasquatch in North America approximately.

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       When I did that show for Psi Phi Joe Rogan questions, everything. I talked to all those fucking goof balls too. I talked to those people in depth for hours. I went squashing. I went out in the woods with those people for days poking around, just poking around, looking at animals. There's a lot of shit out there. There's a lot of weird shit out there like you, you know, there's things you'll never see. Like you could live the rest of your life and never see them outlined or live the rest of your life and never see a wolverine. And we know that they're real. So in their logic they like, but there are people who are very credible witnesses who told him, here's a problem. And I went bear hunting recently and when I was hunting, I saw a squirrel for half a second. I thought that squirrel was a wolf half of one second.

Speaker 2:          01:34:05       It's like, hello, it's a fucking squirrel. You asshole. That highlights, you know, fairly good light. You know, it was towards the, you are and you've been in. Yeah, I'm hunting. I got a fucking boat. I'm there for the full experience. And I thought a squirrel was a wolf. It was only for a half a second. But it happened. I really, I was like, fuck no, it's not a fucking wolf. You, that's all it was that much time. But Oh, that's awesome. That's what happens, man. You see a bear. Okay. And you see a bear standing up on on its back feet, which they do. I've seen bears do it. They stand up on their back feet. It's weird to see because they're big as fuck. When you see a seven foot tall bear standing up and his back feet and he's near a tree and if you see that from really far away and if you're in the woods, the also is, you're not seeing, it's not like it's in a field.

Speaker 2:          01:35:01       You're seeing it in between trees so you're not getting a good view of it. You're getting a view of it from what a, even if it's in the Pacific northwest especially, it's so dense. If it's 20 yards away from you, you're looking at a sliver of it through a dozen trees. It least probably more like a hundred tree is depth. Perception is just fuck, fuck the perceptions. Fuck what you're looking at as fuck. And then if you convince yourself that it was a guy standing up that was like black and covered with hair, you're like, oh my God, I saw big foot. And then you start painting it in your, your head that it was big foot. It's a bear. You dumb fuck. It's a black bear. A big tall black bear that was scratching his back on a tree. Or we saw them rubbing their pussies on trees.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       The females, they back their pussy up to trees and they start rubbing their pussies on church working that they get their ass, they get horny and they start freaking out. You guys, he got it. Got to just find a way. Well, my favorite is there's nothing like that in the fossil record. And they look at you with another blank stare. Like, Hey, you know, we've, we've found every creature that's in the woods now, millions of years of versions of those creatures. We've never seen anything like a big foot. That's where you're wrong. Yeah. Yeah. But it is so incredible. Have you seen one of those things? It is unbelievably gigantic. There's no transitional. I've, I've heard that, that same theory. There's no transitional species that they found like to go from there to anything big foot size. There's no rugby that big. See the thing about

Speaker 3:          01:36:26       gigantic pithy goes, it's really fascinating is they didn't even know it existed until the 1920 some guy, was it an apothecary shop and China and they found, they found it too unknown primate to try to figure out what it was asked. The guy where'd you get this? They take them to this place, they find more bones and they find a job bone that seems to indicate a bipedal hominid because of the position of the jaw bone with the animals that are walking on all fours. Their jaws positioned differently than someone standing straight up. So but based on jaw bones and a couple of other pieces, they put together this enormous primate that they think is between eight and 10 feet tall, which is what a lot of people say. The big foot is between eight and 10 feet tall. The other thing that's weird is that the gigantic pikas existed as recently as a hundred thousand years ago, documented and lived in Asia, which is exactly where the Bering strait connected to the North American land mass before the last ice age.

Speaker 3:          01:37:17       So if something did walk cross during the Ice Age and followed people, which is what they think happened, that people walked across that and came to North America. That's why when they test native Americans, they test their DNA. They find that a lot of them are related to people from Siberia. We just kind of fascinating. So the animal, if it did exist at the time and did camp, they don't know if existed, you know, 15, 20,000 years ago, they know existed a hundred thousand years ago. That's a long, long gap. But if that thing did come and lived in the Pacific northwest, the idea is that a small amount of them would still be there.

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       There is a thing in Siberia they call them almost, that's their word for the wild man, uh, that are like either big neanderthal or small. Uh, I can never say the word [inaudible] again to a pitch again to pick is um, the, so the Russians had their own kind of big foot called an Alma and in the mid 18 hundreds, there's a story of a one called Zona that they had captured and some crazy fucker has sex with it and they produced half Alma kids and their descendants are still live in this village and in the steps of Russia. Yeah. So like stories out there, totally likely stories out there probably definitely happened. I'd fuck big from the end of towels were short. It's fuck, neanderthals were short and strong as shit. Five feet tall, 200 pounds. Dance as fuck. Yeah, they were weird. Bill, break your shit.

Speaker 2:          01:38:43       They were built way more like a gorilla than they were like a person. They like Wade dense thick muscles. And it's interesting that we don't know what they really looked like either. We have these ideas that they make, you know, we don't know what the color their skin was. It's just total speculation as to what color their skin was. You know, we don't know what they looked like. They could've looked way more like some sort of an ape. Yeah, we do know that they fucked people though and that people fuck them. We noticed there was a whole lot fucking going on. Cro-Magnon either push them out or interbred with them. They're competing. Fucked him to extinction. Fucked them into extinction. Man. Took all those crazy freak neanderthal bitches and fuck the shit out of him. Killed their husbands and that's a good, have a good set of genocide, right?

Speaker 2:          01:39:25       Yup. Just fucking and killing everything. It is interesting because they think now they're starting to think that neanderthals were way smarter than we thought they were because their brains are actually larger than, than Homo sapiens. And they thought that those brains that were larger was to compensate for the extra muscle mass and all the different functions that their body was able to perform that ours warrant because they were way stronger than people. Yeah. Then like they would, if we had a neanderthal that was fighting in the UFC, he would make who somal par Horez look like Brad Pickett. Teach me mean fucking leg left leg locks and set it out there. Keep imagine what those fucking things would look like. Just thick fucking five foot tall, 200 pounds. Dense ass, thick bones, giant elbows and shit. Fuck you up. Extra long arms, short legs where you've got to punch it just catches you and pulls you in. Our design. Suck so hard. The JobOne of the modern human, you know, you see guys get right like Schilling and mark, Simon Marcus, perfect shot on the job. Prank shuts everything off. Not the or. Nope. It's like punching a forehead. Part of the reason part of me isn't there at their heads were shaped differently is they had extra attachments here. Dope for muscles. Also for buying raw meat. She's chewing through. Fucking would hide when they didn't have time to advent knives. Just fucking chewing through a fucking woolly mammoths face trying to fucking take it down.

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       Yeah. That's not a good way to live. They don't know what fucking killed those people off. It's fascinating. It, they could have also died off at the end of the ice age. They think because a neanderthals, I don't know if they know when the last ones existed, but they think it's as recently as 40,000 years ago. Yeah. I think that was the, the most recent explanations or ideas. But that's also like 10,000 years ago is when the woolly mammoth died off and the saber tooth tiger, and that's also the coincided with the end of the ice age. And so there's a bunch of guys that think that that happened because of asteroidal impacts that it might have wiped off gigantic slice of the population and the end. It's all might've been too stupid to survive. I Dunno if that makes any sense though. I liked the fucking theory better.

Speaker 2:          01:41:38       Fucking dairy is a little more awesome, I must say. Could you imagine if we found neanderthals doe and they would be technically human. So if some like shoot the box type dude went out there and recruited them. Vandelay recruited them, you know, brought him back to America. He's probably the closest thing to a 20 Anatol. What'd you think about Vandelay running out on his drug test? That stupid. That's unreal. And, but the idea of I ran out cause it was on diuretics. I don't, come on, that's, I don't that it's a little fishy dude. And you know, it's also coming from a guy who we sort of already decided strongly suspect in our nonmedical. Opinion's been rumored according to our friend Phil Baroni. He believes it. I know people who have seen the contracts. Yeah. And who were told by officials that we test for these drugs, but we don't test for steroids. Well Jason Chambers, they told him to get on steroids. Yeah. They wanted them to get up to 185 pounds. Chase is like a weight on one 71 70 right now. And there was like a bigger, you'll one 85 much bigger Jamus on wow. Come kind of come.

Speaker 2:          01:42:49       Yeah. They told him to get on steroids. They don't, didn't pride. They did not play it man. And he was like, fucking, I don't think so. This is not a good idea. The best idea. Yeah. But those were interesting times, man. Like one of my favorite times ever. I used to love getting up in the middle of the night or, or staying up in the middle of the night and watching those cards take place. Live from Japan, like, yeah. What time would they start? It was totally like stupid late at night. Right? I would give the tapes from little Tokyo, but the, at the like little rental stores that do Japanese stuff, that's how you get them. That's how I see good. I was at UCLA man and I would ride my bike to downtown. I didn't have a car at the time and I would go to these video stories and they would barely speak English and I would go, I remember saying like, I want, I've used MMA didn't really exist at the time.

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       It was like pride. And he looked at me and he goes and he didn't really understand me. Hey Pride. And I said, yeah, I remember that man fucking scream for years. Go from get was the only words I knew. And in Japanese five left. There's only where a new Japanese, but I looked at him and I go and I go, shit, I'm trying to think of a name and I just went room on a Saturday when he goes and he points to this area. We had all these shoot and pride tapes, whole section. I remember going back there and back over and over again just to like, cause they had all of them and you couldn't find him anywhere. Optos alumina Sato broken grappler man room and a sauna. Charles Taylor flying armbar to any fucking so cool. Does Edwards coming up on it? He would do grappling competitions too. He was a bad motherfucker. Bad Mama Jama. He can't cone and beat him twice.

Speaker 5:          01:44:26       I did it. Did it. I just mentioned tournament and flying fucking triangle like three out of four people.

Speaker 2:          01:44:31       What did, okay, but think about the level of Jujitsu then and then the level of guys now, where do you, where do you put him?

Speaker 5:          01:44:39       I think that he was back then he was, he was at the level we're at now, almost that level back then. But he was, you know, a lot of those guys that the Japanese aren't, aren't that strong? No, not physically imposing. So I think that's what I have trouble in the US lots. Once you get the super athletes who are physically imposing that just get just as good. Sure. They're slick. But you know, and they have that like one shot, one kill, I'll die before I give up kind of attitude. It just, they just can't deal with the physical strength of, of, you know, I'm American fucking muscle shit like that.

Speaker 2:          01:45:17       I totally agree with that. I make like a, you've look at the guys like, uh, there's no Japanese Mark Coleman's? No. Fujita was pretty, he was pretty close like gas, but it was just a different sort of thing.

Speaker 5:          01:45:32       All right. That Juno Kid. Um, but he never panned out to be,

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       yeah. I mean, well they made him fight Fado and like, I mean, how many nights was he in your sheet? At his first fight? Yeah. You'll, she didn't his first fight fade or within the first couple of years that was, that was another pride thing. Like they would feed guys to the God damn wolves freedom to Fidor eight or what are you thinking? They love that shit and the knockouts brutal too. I mean he just really is helpless and fatal. It's just sniping him just Poland back and watching it. It was exciting to watch. That was, hey no one put a gun to his head alleged. I mean maybe they did. I don't know. Never know dude. Who's a scandal that getting one guy with missing a finger do well, you know it's, it's, that was another knock on Japanese fighters that come to us and oh there's big in Japan and they can do well here.

Speaker 2:          01:46:17       It's big physical wrestlers, man. It's hard to overcome that. What that Japanese like you said kind of balls out submission star. We're going hard for the submission if you don't get it. Okay. I've put your head through the ground. Also, the weight cutting aspect, they didn't really, they weren't cutting weight. Not nothing like Americans are cutting weight. So you would see guys weigh in and they see the guy they were funding like what? That's crazy. Like soccer. I and Matt Hughes. Perfect example. You Know Matt, he uses a big fucking welterweight at at time. I mean he had these, these garden hose muscles that would connect the back of his head to

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       his neck. Yeah, just these thick ass neck fucking country strong and shit and soccer. I was just not able to deal with that. Just it was as a different kind of athlete. Good fucking passing ability. Good Jujitsu, good Jujitsu. He was the first wrestler. My opinion that really learned how to not just take us down and ground and pound them, but learn how to hit things like that far side arm bar that he hit on George Saint Pierre. When George Saint Pierre went for that Komora he had good Jujitsu. He had, he had real solid skills, good defensive skills to, you know like the Frank Trigg, rear naked choke. He can put guys away. He could choke guys and that a soccer. I was just not big enough to talk with them. She doesn't handle soccer. I had some good fucking kicks though too. Big Ass legs, good leg kicks. Fast, fast, accurate, loaded Sato but sato he was one of the first guys to, we saw get a little chimney. He started to go towards the end of his career or just

Speaker 5:          01:47:47       when? Called Luna? Yeah. Yup. Clipped Bang. Or Am I in their rematch? Knocked him right out. Yeah. How about Carl? Who Know How but what a bad ass mother fucker that guy was. He looked when he looked good, he looked fucking nominal. Just super amazing. And then some days you're just like, fuck is this guy. How about when Bj and just charged at him ran offense, pop, pop juice, Kale and him within the first 1520 seconds and just left him there. I mean it was like one of the, we are just salt. Yeah. He's just like for the cops get me like ran out of the cage in the back. Like what the fuck is he gone? It's going crazy. Hilo. I did it for Mana nuts man.

Speaker 3:          01:48:28       He went crazy man. Do you think he has a, you know the, the, the odds are 10 to one against him. Frankie Edgar, 10 to one 10 to one 10 to one yeah. Yeah. I'd take that. Attended one, couple hundred bucks on it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You never fucking know. I mean, especially listening to what you're saying, man, listening to what you're saying about him being in that good a shape. That was always a thing that held him back. And if there's one last that fucks with them, it's not the losses to Nick Diaz or Rory Macdonald guys who were just too fucking pig. He shouldn't have been fighting. Those guys shouldn't have been [inaudible] 70 and now that he's fighting at one 45 and you're like, wait a minute. You used to fight at one 70 you fought Machida to a fuck. What the fuck man, you fought heavyweight. He has sent me, Machida was over two oh five but she was essentially a heavyweight. It was ridiculous. And here he is fighting at one 45 is there ever a guy like that that went from heavyweight down to one 45

Speaker 5:          01:49:30       speaking of size disadvantage. And then he fucking ends up choking out Matt Hughes and knocking it out. Man. He knocked him out with one punch. Him Choking out. Matt Hughes could have been. I don't in many ways kind of a worse thing ever happened to him is that he kept flirting with one 70 against these gigantic

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       dudes. That success, I don't know, maybe set asides too high. We're going to do that. Was the Matt Hughes the only guy he ever beat at one 70 that's interest. Everybody forgets. Matt Hughes was the only guy he ever beat. At 170 pounds. You're going to beat only one guy going back and it is. We kept going back to the well at once. I'm like, Bro, you just can't physically handle those guys. Well, especially George Saint Pierre figured out a way to tire him out first and then beat him up. Increase should up and your grease, your chest or back. Remember we had that guy that was doing like Voodoo on them and shit rubbing his chest and they caught him putting Vaseline on his back like what are you motherfuckers doing? Tended that touching his nipples, his forehead and his fucking giving them the choice. You have grease on your hands.

Speaker 2:          01:50:34       It's not an interesting about the UFC too is that they have cornermen men. Um, but they don't have it. Like boxing has their own cut men. The UFC they bring, they have staff cut men that worked for the entire card. I think that's probably the way to do it. Smarter. Yeah. Cause you run in those Panama Lewis type situations where Louie Resto. Yeah. Irish. Billy can come on. Give me the bottle. I made a, that was the one I made. Aaron Pryor and prior on the hardwire Aguayo was fucking so good. Yeah. The loon resto thing, man. That was, that was the craziest shit ever. Yup. What was the dude's name? The Billy Irish. Billy Collins. Billy Collins. Yeah. That was crazy. That kid committed suicide after himself. Drove us, drove his car into a, off a bridge for people don't know what we're talking about. They took Louie [inaudible], took the padding out of his gloves.

Speaker 2:          01:51:21       That was back in the day. We're a boxing goes were made it a horse hair and a, they didn't have those foam pads like they had today and sometimes they still use those horse hair gloves. Like that was what, uh, my Donna was trying to use with Floyd Mayweather and they were like, pitch, you're not using these fucking luck. Did you ever see that video with Floyd Mayweather? But the day after with the gloves got a real problem with Mei Mei, whether it was putting on goes, it's real simple when you're using these mother fucking gloves. Like it's real sad. I feel my fucking knuckle went using these motherfucking glove and you know, uh, they're like, don't be scared and why are you scared to be scared? Bitch, I ain't scared. I have 49 fucking fights. Right? We're not using these gloves also, dude, my hands are worth $78 million without breaking them because, and not letting him have those gloves.

Speaker 2:          01:52:03       That was the big hit with a hammer. Donna's a vicious fucking punches. But, so they took the horse here out of the gloves. They made a small hole and then pulled the horse here out and it was essentially just taped up knuckles and he beat the shit out of Billy Collins. Fuck. This was undefeated at the time and we really go fight or a little more journeymen and big upset. His eyes were so badly swollen. They took a photo after the fight and the promoter said, why don't you take it with his eyes open and goes, those are open. Like that's as far as he could open them. I mean, they were like, isn't that interesting? That years later MMA fighters were fighting bare knuckled. Yeah. Banned for life. Both banned

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       for life. Louie Resto and Panama Lewis and they both did time for assault. Yeah. And then Panama Louis went to work with Tyson afterwards but couldn't work. The corner. CanNot work. The corner somehow are in his camp, but couldn't work the corner. He can train guys. You can't ever corner anybody. So as he still doing that to this day, to this day, he's still doing it. Louie Resto never got it. A little Billy Collins killed himself, spiraled into depression, killed himself. Louie Resto in and out of trouble. Homeless drug addict. Never got it. You know that I saw a documentary where he tried to talk to, to Billy Collins Dad, we wouldn't have it. Oh Mom. The mom forgave him, the mom and sister and forgave him. But the dad wouldn't have it. And uh, he confessed during the, the thing too that, that they'd wrapped his hand and like this plaster stuff, the same shit that probably are Rito Margarito shit that was in the fucking two thousands bleeding out of his ears.

Speaker 4:          01:53:43       Nose. I mean, and then he can, that's fucking right. That's almost, that's assault with a deadly weapon. I don't, I don't get why. And also I never got wide. Louie Resto and Panama, Louis went to jail, banned for life. Margarito gets caught trying to do the same thing and it's not to the song like it's not you got suspension, but do Louie Resto did time for that. I mean, panel Lewis did. Tom, Shane Mosley that beat the fuck out of him. Right. Beat the piss out of them after they found out they wouldn't let him use the wrap. They put new raps and he got the shit kicked out of them.

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       Shane was like torturing him, like he was punishing him for that and that that was it. It was a great fight for Shane. That was Shane's last great fight too, by the way. Totally fucking pistol. Whipped and bad. Apparently. Shane's a little punchy now. People who have talked to them and interviewing them now they say that it's a, he had a few too many, you know, probably the Margarito fight should have been the last one didn't help, but he fought Canelo after that and fall may with her. Yeah, and they were their Canelo but Canelo want apparently was that was the beating that tough man. Fuck yeah, and better all the time. Getting that Floyd Mayweather fight was a good fight for him. Taught him a lot of shit. You got to, you know when you're in with a guy like that, then moves like Floyd does. Until you see that you don't know what the fuck that is, you know you're not going to get that in training. Who's, who's going to be your sparring partner? That's undefeated world champion, one of the eight or 10 best fighters that's ever walked the face of the planet.

Speaker 4:          01:55:06       The first time you see something, you don't want it to be in a fight. Yeah. You want to have seen that before. At some point in training, you know, I, I play chess. Um, I really like, yeah, that's Billy Collins. After the fight with his eyes open, his eyes are open right now. It's so far that's as good as it would get. Oh my God. That's so fucked up. That's so fucked. Jesus. Never the same. He went blind. Right. He was lost some of his vision's awesome. His vision, and he was trying to sue. He tried to sue basically the commission for not catching the, the gloves because his dad at the end of the fight, you see it, Louie Resto goes up and shakes hands with Billy Collins Dad who's his trainer and he feels the glove and he goes, wait, hey, hey. And he gets a commissioner, but he starts yelling, this club's half the patterns out of it. He shook hands and felt the glove. Yeah. And he tried to sue the athletic commission for letting Louie Resto fight with the pattern move from the glove and not protecting the sun. So it kept, Billy comes from fighting because they were suing. And so he was just sitting around and just getting worse and you know, got depressed and that was all she wrote.

Speaker 2:          01:56:16       Wow. That's fucking fine. Yeah. Yeah. And Panama Lewis is this same fucking guy who gave Richard Aaron Pryor that bottle, the bottle he mixed and he came out against Alexis Arguayo just supercharged. Yup. Like whatever it was, it was in that bottle.

Speaker 4:          01:56:32       Louie Resto said that he used to give him, uh, they were asthma pills, crushed up asthma pill. So you would, you would, it would get your breathing back basically. Amphetamines, Christof Amphetamines. He used to treat asthma.

Speaker 2:          01:56:45       Isn't it interesting that both Aaron Pryor, any more trivia? Just, just let me know. Trivia master, but both Aaron Pryor and Louie Resto became drug addicts. Yeah. Isn't that interesting. And Alexis, shark whale, Eddie really big struggles with cocaine. Big struggles killed himself in Nicaragua. Uh, well wasn't he like a politician in Nicaragua? There there's some suspicion about yeah. And it wasn't like a gunshot wound to the chest. Yeah. Which is pretty weird for suicide. Yeah. Well that's the official story. I niggerize he killed himself while a lot of boxers, especially, they wind up with depression, you know, from just a repeated trauma and cocaine. Cocaine also means no Bueno.

Speaker 4:          01:57:30       Who Was it? Um, Arturo Gotti I saw thinking about his supposedly,

Speaker 2:          01:57:34       oh, that wasn't no fucking suicide. That bitch killed them

Speaker 4:          01:57:38       once. But what I thought was interesting, I saw a very evenhanded documentary about his alleged to aside slash murder, whatever you think. And not once did they go, did they mention pugilistic dementia, which causes depression and suicidal tendencies. They wouldn't, didn't once go. Maybe that hit in the head one too many fucking times. You know what I mean? He didn't, they never once brought it up. I thought it deserved mentioning that, you know, his brain had to be putting at that point,

Speaker 2:          01:58:03       but didn't he have a big, wasn't there like at some point in time, wasn't there? Um, during the, the, the, the incident, whatever killed him. It wasn't there a head trauma, a big

Speaker 4:          01:58:13       he had gotten in a fight that night. That's why they had argued, he had gotten in a fight on the street in Brazil and they interviewed a cab driver. The cab driver drove him from where he was from where the fight was to his apartment and the guy said those blood on the back of my seat, they hit, they had beaten him up pretty good. Like he had hit the ground and he had gotten in a fight with all these Brazilians. He had been Malvin off at this club and his wife left him and that's why they were arguing that night. And so he had gotten a fight with like three dudes on the street. So cab driver said, yeah and there was blood on my seat. He had, you know, nobody beat him like, and then we said all that she had people beat him up and then now he was beat up in the cap when he was in the back of my, my cab and then he was found on the ground.

Speaker 4:          01:58:54       And the only thing that makes zero sense to me, zero of all the whole story. I can see both sides of it. The only thing that makes zero sense is the wife claimed was seen in the morning and thought he was asleep. If you see the photos of Arturo Gotti, which I have on the ground, he's dead in a pool of his own blood. Clearly like you couldn't walk past this and think he's okay. Well, in her stories that she saw him and thought he was all right. He always, he always finds that's what they said he was. He always used to pass out and fall asleep drunk. That it, I'm like, I don't know how you could walk past that and go, ah, he's fine. You know? Okay honey. Okay. All right, good. I'll make some coffee and that's, that's your story, but I hooked up with the wrong bitch. A very interesting, it's an interesting case to say that

Speaker 3:          01:59:40       case. It's, it's a very sad case, but you know when she got out of jail, did you ever see the photos of her out of jail? She was like smiling and laughing when they released.

Speaker 4:          01:59:50       Yeah, that was, yeah, that was, that was family was not pleased about that one. Although if I got left, if I got to let out of a Brazilian Gera for any reason, I'd be smiling and happy too. So I don't take, I don't, I don't hold that so much against it cause I'd be thrilled that I'm not, you know, indicted for murder in Brazil. I'd be thrilled. Um, he said it kind of fucked up.

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       No, like he was a guy who was like sort of, his career was dwindling down. He wasn't going to be like the top of the food chain, Floyd Mayweather type fighters, but he found another guy that was on his level and then it became one of the first trilogy is one of the first series of fights where both everyone knew these guys weren't going to win a title. Yeah. So it was like one of the first fights where it was just an awesome fight because they matched up together. Well, you know, it wasn't an awesome vibe, but Micky, Micky Ward wasn't going to be world champion. Arturo Gotti wasn't, he had a title at one point in time, but he wasn't going to be the best in the world. Everyone knew and that was the thing about boxers is we always wanted to see an undefeated fighter and we always want to see a guy fight for the title. Like the thing about rocky Marciano was always at Marsianno died 49 oh yeah, he was up best matching. I don't never lost. Well, in boxing, that was like the first duo. Those two guys going at it the first match up where we knew that they weren't going to get a world title, but we still wanted to see it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:01:13       You know what's, what's different in combat sports that's unique in combat. Sports is different than another, especially team sports. Popularity and ability just don't go together. They don't know the best guy isn't the most popular guy in our church. God, he was that guy that I would pay to watch that guy fight no matter what. No matter when, even though there were much better guys out there watching Arturo Gotti fight was really something special and he got with Micky Ward

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       and they had that amazing trilogy. Um, the problem is God can do you see the Mayweather fight? That was like humility. I was like hard to watch as hard to watch those too many after that, after the Micky ward trilogy. Yeah. It was also God, he had already taken a lot of punishment, his career and he wasn't, he just had no business being in the ring with Mayweather Mayweather. There's way too sharp in his prime. Yeah, I mean I think maybe it was better. I mean, he was so sharp then. Unbelievable. Great Guy. He's amazing. Now I don't even know why I'm saying this is amazing now, but even like a younger, even faster version of, of Mayweather, he was killed. You know what's really incredible is fucking Hopkins winning a world title nine. That's one of the weirdest examples. Unboxing of all time. You want to talk about a guy that just never faded off?

Speaker 2:          02:02:25       No, still wicked good. I mean knock that Russian dude down in the 10th round at 49 but style wise, he's the kind of guy, if you looked at all his fights, the big knock on Hopkins and he never took a lot of risks. You never know. Never taking damage. He's fighting it 50 cause he never took those and talks great. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. His brain isn't putting, I was just amazed that his body's holding up. It doesn't look totally the same. Like he doesn't look as muscular. He's a little more smooth, loose, a little more soft, but not much of a difference. I think it was part of the reason he's moving up in weight class a lot is, you know, speed is the first thing to go and I think he realizes I can beat these cruisers, I can outslick these cruisers. I don't if you'd do that against Gennady Golovkin guys at middleweight, the middleweight, Andre Ward, those guys are fast and I think he, I think he's smart.

Speaker 2:          02:03:15       He's a really smart guy, is a boxing Iq was amazing. I think you realize is I move up, I cannot slick these guys. That's a good point because for middle weight, the last guy that he had real problems with is Germane Taylor and Taylor was way fast, one 61 60 lightening fast and then, you know, look, look at the performances that he's had at light heavyweight and um, you know, look at what's his name for Pittsburgh? Uh, the, the, the white kid, um, uh, Kelly Patrick from uh, Youngstown on Nice town. Yeah. Kelly Pavlik was a slower guy. Yeah. You know, and Kelly Pavlik didn't have that sort of ethnicity. Him looked like a fool. It was beautiful performance. I made him look ridiculous for 12 rounds and everybody was shocked and he was doing it at what, like 43 back then it was like, this is incredible. Six years later you would think there's no way he's going to win a world title six years from them.

Speaker 2:          02:04:07       But I think that's why he's moving up and staying in these weight classes where he doesn't worry about that kind of speed. Yeah, that's a good point, man. That's the hardest thing to deal with at that age. Yeah, that's a good point because he's so good at being in the right place to make a guy move. And you also, you know how like you see a guy like, like today we saw like there was one point in time where cubs wants and winds up and I'm seeing him getting ready to throw kick. It's cause we've seen a guy getting ready to throw a kick. We've seen a subtle changes and when a guy's getting ready to throw a kick and you could spot it, Bernard Hopkins, he's seen so many guys in front of him do things. So many guys try to hit him with punches.

Speaker 2:          02:04:44       He knows what they're going to do before and they know what they're going to do. Oh yeah. So when he's stepping and forcing guys into positions where he knows what they're going to do, once they get into that position, they don't even know what they're going to do. He's like two and three steps ahead of them. So because of that boxing knowledge that he has, you get to see like this really pure sort of a like a, a pure execution of boxing from him. Dismantling the executioner, but not anymore. Now he's an alien. I had to say that he's the alien and there'd be throwing the softball. Got to hit it. She called him. Yeah. He wears a rubber mask. He goes into the ring with a rubber it, where's the rubber fucking alien mask? He calls himself the alien. This is officially the longest podcast we've ever done.
