Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Five, four, three, two. Oh, we jumped the gun. Hey Amy. Hey, good. Thanks for doing this man. Appreciate it. I'm glad to be here. How's things? Well, outside of Vegas. Everything's good. I know, right? You have to say that everybody. I mean this, these things that happen that sort of just changed the whole world. You gotta think that's probably one of the reasons why these psychos do it in the first place. Right? So that everyone talks about them. It becomes their, their big fireworks. Fourth of July grand finale before they leave.

Speaker 2:          00:00:38       Yeah. There was a very interesting post by a guy named Robert King on psychology today and I guess he's doing research in this and he talked about it as a way for men to get or chase status and that he saw two bombs. I think one was at 23 and one at 41 in terms of the ages that people do this and it does tend to be men who have some kind of their marriage breaks up, they lose their job in their forties are the young men are just chasing status, so it's, it's, it's at least some kind of explanation other than, oh, someone just went wild. They just went crazy. Which is not helpful because it doesn't tell us really what we can do to maybe prevented or look at how do we look for these people who do this?

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Yeah. Well, to prevent it, you have to lock all men up. Not for that. That's the only way. I mean not obviously not the only way, but it's all men. That's a giant issue, right? I mean it's, you never see women go on mass shootings,

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       but well without men who we'd still be living in grass huts, so

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       listen, I'm a man. I'm all pro men, but it's very weird that it's entirely men who do mass shootings and drive trucks into crowds and that kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Well, I think we may start seeing women do that, but actually I don't think it's weird that it's men because men, if you look at how men and women evolved to get partners, women just have to look hot. You have to look like you're fertile and young and have good genes, which is what we consider beauty. These what feminists say are arbitrary standards of beauty or anything like that. They're very across cultures. Men like women with this hourglass figure and who have long shiny hair and who are not 72 because if you had sex with a 72 year old, your genes died out out.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       Yeah. This feminist thing about arbitrary standards of beauty as a person who is deeply entrenched in science, like that's gotta be frustrating, right? Because you're looking at something that's not accurate. It's you're pushing a narrative that's just not accurate. There's this very takeaway culture takeaway. You know all the, all your personal feelings about human beings and you look at the mammal, the human mammal, and it's. It's very clear why the certain males are gravitating towards certain and

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       contrary or conversely why certain females or gravitating towards certain males. It's biological and this. It's so unhelpful. It's really awful. This idea that people should like you for Watson down the inside, we don't see the people. If you look at porn, it's not the woman who buys a homeless man a sandwich. You know who in the porn. It's the woman with those features that are just cross culturally appreciated by men, but it's also too, we're talking only about sexual, right? Because people do like you for who you are on the inside. Like Melissa McCarthy is a perfect example. She's as vibrant, hilarious woman and no one's. No one's holding her up as the standard of beauty or sexual attractiveness. You know, you're. You're looking at her as this fun person and that's why millions of people go see her in movies and her tv shows is giant hit mean.

Speaker 3:          00:03:51       It's literally what's on the inside and how she carries herself and she is very vibrant and if you look at that cross cultural research, David Buss who is an evolutionary psychologist, did the big, big cross cultural study and kindness was what both men and women wanted. I think that was the top, the top of each list. But if you prioritize, well, okay, well what do I. What are my must haves in a partner? A guy is not going to want a very old, unattractive woman as his partner. If he can do better and a woman is not going to want to have the guy who is sleeping in grandma's basement playing Atari, Atari or whatever. I'm a girl so I don't know anything about football or video games. My boyfriend tried to educate me on the way over about some, I don't know, some guy who said something insulting to female sports announcer,

Speaker 4:          00:04:42       Cam Newton pretty popular quarterback said, uh, he got a question from a beat reporter that works for the his team and ask them something about our wide receivers route running. And he said it's surprising that a girl is asking about route running or something like that, and he got a lot of shit about it right now you've got to drop from a sponsor.

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       So sort of going on further, is that all he said, it's surprising that a girl, I believe so in then they, I heard that they went further into it, off off the record a little bit and he was rude, is what she said. Oh, we really expect the football, the quarterback to be the height of, you know, politeness and social etiquette and okay, he shouldn't have said this. And I think that these, there are some incredible women who are sports announcers. So I'm told by the boyfriend and I think it's sexy to be a knowledgeable woman in sports. Um, however we now prosecute everybody for everything. And the reason we do that is there's too much media. Everybody's got a microphone. Everyone's on twitter. So now this stuff, that dumb stuff, people would have said another era that would have just gone off into the ether. Now it is just, it's a new story. Do you think is that, is it, I mean I'm sure it is that, but isn't it also that we're examining behavior on a much more scale

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       than we've ever done before and we see things that we don't like and we're highlighting those things in a much more aggressive way than we've ever done before. It's almost like there's accelerating social evolution that's going on right now and along the way you're getting a lot of bumps and a lot of weird stuff that's happening. A lot of social justice warrior stuff and then you've got a lot of all right stuff on the other side and they're battling it out with each other and it's almost like these intense extremes on this new landscape and people are jockeying for positioning on this new cultural standard playing field.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       Well, I think what's happened is that now everyone has a microphone and just so everyone's on twitter, everyone can make a tweet that put out a tweet that gets tweeted and retweeted two, 4 million people and so people are looking to have standing and they're doing it by putting out their opinions and they also. When you're saying this about these tribes, they do it to signal, look, I'm part of this tribe. I'm a social justice warrior. I'm on the right. I'm Antifa. And so I think that that's a big part of it. So they're looking for criminal behavior, socially criminal behavior and whereas, you know this guy, I mean, do I really expect every quarterback to have the most pc views? No. And okay, he's gonna lose his sponsorship when he says something like this, but you know, if you open the quarterback can, you're going to see quarterback stuff in there and it's not, you know, emily post,

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       well first of all with quarterbacks and with any football players, you're dealing with head trauma, you are 100 percent dealing with head trauma. There is an extremely high likelihood that all those guys on the playing field or have erratic behavior due to the fact they're head's been smashed a 150 fucking times a year since they were a kid. And that is just a fact. There's no getting around that.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Yeah, and I actually, I really appreciate that. We're starting to see people look at that and bring that out so parents know, you know, do you want your son to play football or to play some other sport?

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Yeah, I mean look, I have kids and I wouldn't want my kids to fight even though I'm a commentator and fighting. Right. I just think like, God, if you really want to do it, I mean I'm, I'll support them in anything they really want to do, but I would tell them, but it's just the upside and the downside. Like if you can get out, like some guys get out like floyd mayweather. I mean he's just a brilliant tactician and a incredibly good defensively and he got out relatively unscathed, but you really won't know how unscathed until 10, 15 years from now when you see them struggling with his words. Right, right. It's just not worth it. Life is. Life is short, but it's long if you're fucked up. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       And you see that from these guys. I read some story about that the other day. I'm trying to think who is the guy so, so sad and this thing about it showing up much later where you get terribly mental, mentally ill people. They make those tradeoffs where they think, okay, well I can get money and fame way and it's quick

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       and everything like that, but they don't really realize what the longterm consequences will be.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       Well, I think a lot of people in the got into football and even people that got into fighting, they didn't. They didn't know as much back then when they first entered this sort of journey. Especially football. I mean football being we really. There was no conversation about that. Think about like the Oj trial, you know, I've been kind of on the Oj kick lately because I started watching that Cuba gooding jr series where they sort of reenact and it's really kind of freaking me out because bringing back the memories of the nineties and what, what it was like when that, when that thing went down, I was with my girlfriend at the time and we were sitting in front of the television holding hands and you know, like waiting for the verdict and when, when they said not guilty, she threw her hands on her face. Like she had just seen a horrible car accident. She was like, oh my God. Oh my God. She kept shooting.

Speaker 3:          00:09:50       Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. And

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       now today they're saying the, the, the, the very doctor that was working with Oj said if they were going to do that case again today, they would absolutely bring up. See?

Speaker 3:          00:10:05       Yeah. I think you're right about that. Absolutely. And there's so many football players who got in just not knowing who will come out like that. I think within a number of years, yeah, that was only 20 years ago, 23 years ago, whatever it was. That's not that long ago, so 23 years ago nobody thought about brain trauma came to facebook, which is just nuts.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       Well now these guys are debilitated. There's a whole bunch of different lawsuits that are going on right now with the NFL and you're seeing these older players. I mean they have on real sports at Bryant Gumbel and they're sitting there and they're shaking and they can't control themselves and you're like, wow, well this is, this is on

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       unheard of 20 years ago, 30 years ago, we never thought of this. This was never in the public discourse. Yeah, and I suspect if you go back and look at those tapes sort of forensically that you'll see that kind of thing just shaking and, and also that if you look at to take a look at over football players, how many people have these, these diseases and mental illness that's related to this head trauma? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       I'm sure quite a bit, but mean this football player guy that we're talking about, Cam Newton.

Speaker 3:          00:11:07       You know what, the only thing that's wrong with. I mean it's not even wrong. I mean he's trying to get sponsors. That's the whole deal. Yeah, and if you're whatever Coca Cola or whatever the company is, you don't want someone representing you that does something like that. No. And so it's sort of normal. Yeah, well it's normal that they say, okay, we're dumping you and it's normal that he would say it, but what's always funny is that these, these companies, they profess surprise when it's like, really? You thought that this person was going to be the sort of curtailed reigned in person. It's like with Kathy Griffin. Oh, you just figured out that she says events of things that was a surprise to you? Well it wasn't. I mean with, with her was just so poorly thought out. It's like, what do you, what is

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       the message there? You're holding a bloody head like Jesus Christ. Like when we. I mean, if you want to hold up the bloody head of some murderous dictator who's killed a bunch of people, then I kind of understand. But even then like what, what is, are you isis? Like, what's this message?

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       Right. Well, I think she didn't think it out and it was just okay, outrage, trying to be shocking, trying to be shocking. And then the sort of fake apology and then okay, take it back.

Speaker 1:          00:12:19       It's the fake apology. And then it was like a, he's a bullying and he broke me. And like, like playing the victim card.

Speaker 2:          00:12:26       Yeah, you're a comedian, you know, and I know comedians have like that. Then you know what someone's going to heckle you on and so you have stuff ready for that. And this thing like where she's all like,

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       for me, my career is over. I don't have a career now is like, oh all right, just take a couple months off. You'll be fun. Yeah. Right. People forget there's some new outrage. Well there's always going to be. It's always has some new crazy fucking thing and it was also going to be a bunch of people that are probably excited that you did that too. They'll calm down after a while. It won't be in the news anymore and yeah, it's just we live in a time where everything is hyper examined.

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       Yeah, it is, and so that standard and that's why I think we have to be more lenient with people. This idea that you say something awful and then you're excommunicated. You lose your job. You're going to be living in a dumpster. This is really wrong. We need to understand that to be human is to be an asshole. We're all assholes. We all say shitty things to people and I try to recognize my assholeishness and apologize when I've been awful and make good. If sometimes you have to put some money into making good. It's. It's what the situation calls for William.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       No, right. Look, especially when you run into someone in traffic and they're screaming at someone and giving them the finger like you don't know what that poor person has been through that day. Like obviously they're there. They're at nine, they didn't start at one when they were in that traffic incident. They're probably at nine already and then this Saben

Speaker 2:          00:13:47       motherfucker. That's where they're coming from. Raw nerve. Yeah. And so it really is important. People see it as a sign of weakness, but it's actually a sign of strength to say, I'm ashamed I did this bad thing. I did this recently. I shouted on the phone, very bad to this. Some really nice person at the Kaiser Pharmacy just because you know, she should magically solve my problem. It wasn't a problem she could solve, but after I did that I thought like, oh, this is so terrible. Number one, I talked to her. She's kind, she didn't deserve this. So I actually, I went in and I asked for her and I said, I'm so ashamed. I spoke to you terribly. You didn't deserve this. You're very kind to date and purpose. Uh, excuse me in person, in person because well, I was going there anyway to pick up my medication. So it was easier. But I actually asked to speak to her because I think it means something to people. When you do that thing where you say you put your ego aside and say, look, I was bad and I was wrong. People appreciate that you're doing that. It gives them something back and it steals from people to just do something and then think, ha ha, I got away with it because you didn't. You know it and actually they know

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       it and they feel bad and I don't like to make people feel bad. Well also you feel less about yourself and I think that's as important as anything like one of the things about, unless you're a sociopath, when you do something mean to someone, you feel bad about yourself, you don't judge yourself the same way. You look at yourself and your own behavior and you go, wow, I'm, I'm faulty. I'm like, I don't. I'm not proud of that. That's awful. Like what I did was a bad thing. I feel bad about who I am and if you just deny that you're just building up this weird wall of disconnect between you and reality and you're going to make more and more shitty choices if you do that and you are. I, I think that you are the sum total of your behavior so you can feel all sorts of ways.

Speaker 5:          00:15:36       You can fail wimpy and afraid and feel like you don't want to apologize, but if you behave the good way, the better way, the way you want to be, then you're that person. It doesn't matter what your feelings are. Well, this is one of the main issues that I have today with this right versus left social justice warrior thing that's going on, like people are being so fucking aggressive and so rude and so just the way they are trying to silence people from speaking, the way they're describing people and attacking people. It's a. it's a very aggressive way and it's very short sided because when you have that sort of short sided aggressive, what's you're doing is like you're yelling, shut the fuck up. Well, when you yelled, shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to shut the fuck up. They don't just go, oh, okay.

Speaker 5:          00:16:24       Like you're, you're. This is a childish way of approaching an issue like the, the, the more objective nuanced, more thought out way of approaching it is to take into consideration how this other person is going to view what you're saying. Like the only way to get people to change is to present them and art or some sort of an argument or some sort of a, an idea that is both polite and well thought out and, and there's no social issue involved in it. Like there's no negative back and forth between you where you're trying to get them and they're trying to get you. The only way to get someone to really take into consideration your ideas is to have them in some way respect your, like you. And as soon as you tell someone, shut the fuck up. Like, well, that's out. Okay, well that's out, and now it's just like you're just going to win by having more people yell or what are you going to do?

Speaker 5:          00:17:20       You're gonna put a ski mask on and break windows like, is that how you're going to get this done? You're not. You're just going to cause an action reaction, you're just going to cause this sort of rubber band effect. We pull it back and then it snaps and then you've got some sort of ridiculous infighting where people go full tribal and they get one side goes against the other side and this is what you're seeing today and, and you're seeing people do it to get attention as well. You're seeing people do it clearly when they know the cameras are on, they ramp it up and starts yelling obscenities

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       and being more ridiculous about it and it's very odd. It's very odd to watch it play out, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       so short sided. Yeah, they practically wait. Okay. Are you rolling? Three, two, one. Okay. Smash the window. You know what you said reminded me the worst thing a man can say to a woman is calmed down. It always has the opposite effect. At cop once said that to me, I called the local police station about some problem. The Guy told me, calm down. I'm like, does that work on your girlfriend? Because it's not working on me. It never works in any woman's. So here's a tip, dude, what doesn't work on men either doesn't work on anybody, maybe it works on kids, not just kids and work on anyone. I tell my kids to calm down. The opposite effect, always shut off for any of these things. He's rude approaches and so the thing is, when you get somebody, what you do is you provoke somebody defensiveness.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       It's a fight or flight reaction. You know this happens to us on an emotional plane as well, and so you're provoking that whole reaction that's designed to make you get away from a bear or some type of wild animal. But instead of writing and burning off all those biochemicals, it's all pooling in you. You're filling with hate and rage. So this is not a state in which you can listen to anyone and so the moment you take it up to that area of invoking somebody hate and defense and rage and all that stuff, they are, they're so far away from listening, you might as well just crawl under the desk and go read a novel. It's just so pointless to even engage with them. And so the people who do want to engage, if you engage on a pole light level, maybe possibly if someone is just not totally reeled in by confirmation bias, they might listen and confirmation bias of course is that thing where we believe what we already believe and when we throw away any disconfirming evidence.

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       And so you know, if you recognize these propensities, we have to do that to believe what we believe, to be tribal, to stick to this side, to not listened to, not change our views. The maybe have a hope of changing your views and maybe if you try to listen to other people who, you know, there are differing views who are polite and trying to engage on a rational level. You can learn something. I try to be open minded. I try to take criticism. I try to not rejected out of hand. Of course I don't take the criticism that comes from dear bitch, you ugly whore. Like to get those. Yeah. But I always think like, just drop the deer. If you're going to start with bitch, you ugly whore. The humor comes in, comes in when they're being polite, whether criticize it. Yeah. I love that. I love that. It's so funny. Well, people,

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       when they get in arguments, it becomes a competition, you know, and that's, that's a big part of the whole insult thing in the part, just shouting down thing. It's like you're trying to win and you're trying to win an argument that very few people ever. When, I mean it's, it's, it's, it's usually like both people walk away just disgusted with a loss, you know, it's very rare that unless someone is egregious, Lee incorrect and you literally have to shout them down because what they're doing is horrific and you need to point it out to them, but usually not the case.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       Well, usually it's disagreement, you know, most of the time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:51       Right. And these people think they're so convinced it's religion. They think that they're right. We are on the left, we're right, we're on the right, were right and they are just unwilling to listen. It's cartoonish. Now I saw something the other day about this great girl at Bernard, Tony Braxton, and she's this young journalist student. Tony around accidents a I r e e k. anyway, I can see what a strange name. I know she's from Ohio and from a poor family and got a scholarship to Bernard and you see how hard she works. She's a journalist and she looks to see different sides of things and I really respect that in her because you don't see that in a lot of people that age. There's just such polarization. I forget why I was bringing her up. It's this thing. Oh, I know she posted something so she wrote an article.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       They have, you know, Columbia Republicans who are, you know, who knows? What do they want to bring in? Like Ben Shapiro. I love the idea that anyone would be afraid of Ben Shapiro behind me on the street. I'd be like, oh great. Fantastic. Dark Alley. Ben Shapiro. No problem. Sorry Ben. But who's a nice guy? I don't know him, but he seems fine. You know, we're a little Yamaka and everything. I'm post Jewish so I can make Jewish jokes Jewish. So I draped it. Yes. I'm an escape Jew and so they. Somebody posted something about being against white supremacists and it was really about like they're going to have a Republican speaker, you know, and there was so ugly about Republicans and I thought, God, have you ever talked to one? My parents are Republicans. My friend Tom, who this Christian lawyer I know, he feeds the homeless because he thinks that split. Jesus said you should do. These are not horrible people who are burning crosses in lawns. They're your next door neighbor depending on where you live, grows

Speaker 5:          00:22:33       generalization. That doesn't do anyone any good, especially when you're talking about someone like Ben Shapiro. Ben is a very well read, very well thought out, very reasonable, and when you talk to him in person, he's a very kind guy. There's nothing wrong with him. He's just conservative, you know, and whether I agree or disagree and I'm sure I disagree with him on a lot of things. I had a really pleasant time talking to him. I think he's a very nice guy. His ideas and his, his. The way he speaks is very well thought out. He speaks very quickly and it's intimidating to a lot of people, his ideas and the the, the idea that he is this extremely articulate right wing guy immediately. The best way to silence that is white supremacy. Kay Kay Kay. He's a Nazi. I've seen people call Ben Shapiro and Nazi. He wears a fucking Yama. I know he's an Orthodox Jew,

Speaker 2:          00:23:25       right? It's hilarious. So amazing. It's so amazing and that kind of thing. We see it on both sides and there was something the other day, so Dana Loesch, she's a commentator and she's apparently very pro nra, so people send her just the ugliest tweets and I'm sure I disagree with her on a number of things. They don't really look at her views

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       extensively, but they were things like, you know, I hope you die in a hail of gunfire or something like that. Along those lines, outside the NRA headquarters, but I love this one. The Guy said, dear God, and he spelled God, g, Dash d, we really are going to pussy foot onto the oh and in God on the vowels. Like I love that. That's like extreme left people that won't even acknowledged the existence of God. So even as they write it, they put a, like an Asterick I think he might've been a religious guy or something, you know, maybe. So, I mean, I write books with fucking the title and I always want them to write the full fuck, but it's just, it was like enough to get the fuck in there with the asterisk and everything. Funny that we're afraid of words like that. Like, oh my God, like, what do you, what do you think you're confusing someone with like, oh, they actually meant, oh, Petunia, you know, asterisk makes it all.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       Okay. So there are people, and my favorite ones, some people reviewed one of my books. They would say like, this book is filled with profanity. It has fuck on the, what was your first fucking clue? Yeah, it's a really, really weird with that kind of stuff. It's just, you know, what, what they get upset about. Um, I know Dana, I've met her. She's very nice. You know, I've been on our show once, right after that, Cecil, the lion thing happened and brighter. Vaguely remember that she's, uh, she's, she's like a, a right wing woman. I'm pretty sure she started at her life. I think she was very left wing and one point in time and saw a lot of hypocrisy in the left and switched over to the right. But again, it's like we were talking about before, she's very tribal, you know, she's nra tribal, pro gun second amendment and they dig their heels in and that's it.

Speaker 3:          00:25:27       You know, bumps. I want the bump stocks, I want the fucking full auto. I want magazines, big magazines. Like no matter what happens and I think you know, to be, I call myself a neither. I'm neither a Democrat or Republican. I'm libertarian, fiscally conservative. And I think that helps me identifying as sort of a. nothing helps me to not succumb to so much of that. You know, I of course being human, I do have views and I tend to stick to them, but I try to be open. Well, when you go nra though, I mean this is the thing is like if you're like a very outspoken nra person and she was famously involved in one of those really aggressive videos about the NRA. Just see that video that was, it was like a sort of like, it was really recently very controversial video talking about gun ownership and there's, it was like a sort of pro nra video that was like widely criticized on the left and I think the, I know the subject of gun ownership and just what happens to these mass tragedies. I mean it is, it is a conversation that stirs up tribalism logic. It's, it's a very complex, very. And also mental health issues. I mean I want to know what was going on with this. I want to know

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       this Vegas Guy, was he on some sort of psych meds because a giant percentage of these people are and what's the ramifications of that and why? What is causing this fucked up behavior? Is it simply, you know, what people love to call toxic masculinity manifesting itself in the most horrific form? Or is there some other factors? I mean, these disassociative psych meds that they put these people on that allow them to just deal with life in a way where they just don't feel, you know? I mean, have you ever been on psych meds? Yeah, I took Zoloft ones and. Oh, and I forgot. I take adderall every day. You're pilled up. Fuck. It's great. I'm not on it now because I would talk so fast. I might hurt people with my speech. So a lot of people in here that are on adderall because they feel like when they do a podcast they need to be ramped up to keep up.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       And Jesus, it's so obvious. You're like slow. I want to get them drinks. And sometimes I offer them drinks. I'm like, let's, let's have a drink. I know. I know better even though it slows me down and I'm on the same dose at seven point five milligrams and the total lightweight of lightweights. But um, so the Zoloft I took because I went to a psychiatrist in New York and you know, date, they actually tried to give me like lithium and all these other things like for manic depressive people. My friends said you're manic depressive. And basically it's so crazy because all I was, it wasn't some kind of inexplicable, horrible depression. I didn't have a boyfriend. I didn't have any money and I was bombed and I took us all off. Then I realized that just shaved off half of my personality. So I did the really dumb thing you're not supposed to do, which is just I thought like fuck this shit, flushed it down the toilet.

Speaker 1:          00:28:16       And then I fell off a cliff emotionally. I think that was a bad idea. Not only that, what'd you do those poor fish river? My follow this bodies. Yeah. Well they said that there's like Lotus a bowl, like trace elements. Like you could actually measure trace elements and some water supplies of, of antidepressants probably. Sorry everybody water. But isn't that funny that, that saying that like I've talked to people that are extremely defensive about their use of antidepressants and when you bring in, anybody discusses, especially someone like you who has tried them and is open about like, what was the cause here I was bummed out. I didn't have a boyfriend. Like if you say that to people they love to, to generalize depression as a disease, it is a disease, there is a mental issue and no, no exercise, diet, change of lifestyle, you know, love in your life, none of that's going to fix it. Having a career that's really fulfilling, none of that was going to fix it. I have a disease and I need medicine for my disease. See, that's such a. just a sort of wary one note idea. And I love the research of this guy, Randy Nessie. I love him. He's a psychiatrist and an evolutionary psychologist and he talks about how, I suppose it's any sse and you can go on his website. He's now at University of Arizona

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       because he was in Michigan's freezing there. Everybody out eventually moved to Arizona. All these professors. Anyway, um, so he talks about how depression, um, you know, the sad feelings, these are adaptive and so when something bad happens to you, being sad causes you to slow down, you have the features of a sad person which has causes other people to gather around you and be empathetic. And if it goes on for too long, you may chase people away. But this allows you to think about what dumb fucking thing you did that made you get in the state. And I talk about how emotions are motivational tools. We think of them as sort of like wallpaper for our head to decorate our life, but they're not emotions when you're happy that says do more of that when you're depressed. I stopped doing that, reflect on it. And so there are different kinds of depression.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       There's a kind that is this medical depression that's inexplicable and that maybe drugs are needed for. But often I think that doctors, psychiatrists, um, my experience was in my experience listening to other people because I write this advice column and I get letters from everybody. And I've been doing this for a long time since the early nineties, is that doctors just say here's a pill, and a lot of these antidepressants, they've been shown that they don't really work and so maybe it's a placebo effect, which actually is a thing, but a lot of times it's people are medicating away this helpful part of depression and sadness, which is reflecting and drawing people to you and all of this. And so this idea of it's a disease that, that it's also used with alcoholism. It just this idea. People like to put these things in these neat boxes and it doesn't really work.

Speaker 5:          00:31:24       Yeah, I couldn't say that any better. And I think that there are people that do have mental issues that do need medication. We're not generalizing. I mean, I think just like some people have liver problems, some people have thyroid issues, there are absolutely people that have issues with their brain's ability to produce serotonin. I mean it's just a fact. And how many of those people is the real question and to generalize completely, let's say, you know, all depression is a disease that should be medicated or all depression can be cured with exercise. I don't know. I don't think it's healthy to go either way. I think there's. I know many people that have been in really bad places in their life. They got on some sort of an Ssri and then they started feeling better and then they wean themselves off and now their life is in a way better place. Like a good buddy of mine. He was suicidal. He got an a in. The really interesting thing is when he got on medication, like he couldn't find the right one. And that is really so baffling. So it's, it's, it's science obviously, right? When you're talking about medicine, you're talking about medication. But there, there's this little lot of guesswork to this whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:31       You know, I have to say, because I'm writing a big expo, say now I didn't intend to do this, but I tried to shove it off on both Nina tie shall send a doctor's eads and they wouldn't, they wouldn't bite. So I'm, I'm doing it reading medical research. I can't even begin to tell you how non evidence based maybe even most of our medical carriers, it's so terrible and I'm lucky that I have a psychiatrist now who is really evidence based and went on for future training, further training because I had been taking Ritalin, which just made me jumpy. It didn't really help me with my focus. Ritalin and Zoloft. Well the sky, he changed me. I told him I actually started taking. I was self medicating. This is bad. This is before I read as much science as I do. I was taking Musinex in.

Speaker 2:          00:33:15       The guy's like, oh my gosh. Yeah. We used to kind of get behind the counter. It's like in some kind of like they make meth out of it, you know, they said you have to like sign, you know, it was buying at different pharmacies and hoping I wouldn't get arrested, you know. Meanwhile, I'm just taking it to right, not, you know, do anything. I didn't have meth lab in my basement. I don't have a basement. So that helps. Um, but um, so this guy said, okay, we're gonna change you because I told him I couldn't focus. He said you can't take this, it's making your heart race or whatever. And he said that this adderall, what it does that's different, it pushes a little dope me up out into your brain besides being a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which we hear with Serotonin, with the antidepressants.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       So it regulates that. But it also goes like spurt. Here's little dopamine. And the first day I was on that, the first pill I took, it was the best writing day I'd had really in 20 years. It was amazing. And so I'm still on the same dosage and everything. But this guy, he gave me my life back because it was tortured or right before that and, and, and that really was a big deal and so much of a medical care, if you look at the stuff on Diet and unit tie shows has been great on this. Gary Tobbs, the EADS, you know, there are other people on this who have shown that look, don't eat this high carb, low fat diet and the government recommends it, will make you sick and fat. And I'm here this high fat, low carbohydrate diet for many people, maybe not all because we have individual differences.

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       This seems to be the most healthy diet and also not eating polyunsaturated fatty acids and stuff like that that we know about. Um, more and more. And you see more and more on that. Yeah. Right. And so, but my doctor, Kaiser, I love to say that those healthy whole grains on the wall, there is no such thing as healthy whole grains. I haven't eaten a, been on a hamburger since 2009, you know, I just wouldn't. It's just dumb. I eat bacon and grease all day and I'm very healthy. I, um, even though my doctor actually thinks I'm going to have artica heart detect by next week, the truth is if you actually think, well, because my cholesterol is like 303 and then. But what I know, and this is from Mike eades, the doctor who wrote the protein power, he, um, he has this great blog where he talks, he's very evidenced based but explains it very well. There are these ratios. You look at what's the ratio of your triglycerides to hdl. And so basically my ratios, which the doctors don't have, Kaiser don't understood. They are so good that I say that I'm as likely to have a heart attack. I am to be kicked in the knee by a Unicorn. I'm so not in danger of that and it's just terrible. They sent me this letter to say, eat a low fat diet. Thanks

Speaker 5:          00:35:45       crazy though. The doctors are doing this. I mean, I understand that they went to school a long time ago and I understand that a long time ago. That is what people thought that if your cholesterol hit a certain point, you needed to take some sort of medication to lower your cholesterol, but if you eat a healthy diet and your body is doing well on that healthy diet like you have to take into consideration like what are the whole, what are the, what are all the factors involved in in health and vitality and the understanding of hdl versus ldl and the balance of triglycerides. If you're a doctor and you don't understand that and you're giving advice and you're telling people to get on statens, it's fucking disturb. It's terrible, it's terrible, and those statens are fucking terrible for you.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       Terrible effects. They can cause diabetes. They have just the worst side effects and this is the thing that I look at when I'm looking at research or looking at because I do what I call applied behavioral science, so it's science help as opposed to self help. I look at what are the tradeoffs. If I tell you this, what are the tradeoffs in doing this where you know, where are you going to have a problem? How worthwhile is this solution? And, and that's what doctors aren't looking at when they get people statens. It's sort of like from the drug companies mouths to you, your gut. Well, it's just so

Speaker 5:          00:37:03       many doctors are basing their decisions and the, the advice they give on really old evidence or excuse me, really old knowledge

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       evidence, quote unquote keys fraudulent quote unquote science and it's so terrible and sees, yeah, he did this quote unquote research, but he excluded countries that didn't show searches this, this is, it was in the, I think it was in the fifties. He did this multiple countries study where he looked at what people ate and what he did. It's like this, there's a story from the Holocaust where a guy shot all these bullseyes in the wall and some army person came up to him and said, how did you learn to shoot that way? He said, it's easy. I first shot the wall. Then I drew the bullseye. And so that's when an sell keys did with this research and he excluded any countries that didn't fit what he wanted to say, which is eat this diet that we've been eating. Our government told us to eat for years, this high carb, low fat diet that actually causes you to be just hungry motherfucker all day.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       And then also spikes. Yeah. And so, you know what I learned from Gary Tobbs, who's actually a friend of mine, so I got an early on the low carb thing because I heard while he was writing this, that carbs. So this is potatoes, starchy vegetables, fruits, fruit juice, they sugar these things cause the insulin secretion that puts on fat that makes you diabetic and all these things. And there's some indication that maybe Alzheimer's is diabetes. Three diabetes of the brain. They need more evidence on that. But personally I do not eat sugar. I eat one tiny little ice cream thing a week just so I won't feel totally deprived. But um, when I, when I Bacon and stuff all day, steak and green beans, drowning and butter, I don't feel deprived and it's better for me. And um, you know, if you can do that, that's not much of a sacrifice. Okay. I won't eat the bond. Big Deal. I read

Speaker 5:          00:38:53       Garrett's book and I had him on the podcast as well. It's a fascinating thing, very controversial to a lot of people email me. I need to get on and refute what he said is. All right, relax. I literally got dozens of people that did that to me, but the thing that's most shocking, I started following mark sisson's primal blueprint diet and when I, when I started doing it, cut out all the sugar pretty much. I mean I fuck around every now and then, but one of the things that was so shocking was my appetite, my appetite was so unmanageable like it used to. I was ravenous. I would eat and then I would be exhausted and then I would be fucking ravenous like four hours later. Like if I went three hours or four hours without eating, I was starving and I've, I regularly do intermittent fasting now or I'll do 14 hours between, between. It's really good for your body and I lost a lot of body fat for doing that and then the big. But the big thing was that when it came time to eat, it wasn't like I was holding my breath the entire time, but finally it wasn't that at all. It was just so normal and I was like, oh. So there's some other process that I thought I, I attributed to hunger. I was thinking, oh, okay, I get really hungry, but it's not just hunger, it's insulin, it's

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       insulin. It makes you hungry in that way. Before I stopped eating bread, I went to starbucks in culver city and I would always get the thing that was the regular fatty thing, Chris, on whatever. And I know I love all that kind of food. So good. But I got by accident, somebody gave me the sugar, the fat free, whatever. And after about 20 minutes I wanted to bite off somebody's arm in line. I wanted to kill people. The counter get some things. It makes you feel so terrible. And I looked at all those years I had dieted and I, at one point I just thought like, ah, you know what? If anybody's like me, a little rounder than other people, fuck them. And I started going to bobby's diner in New York City having this chicken potato Burrito, which now he wouldn't eat the bread and the potato, but um, and I started losing weight just by eating like a normal human being and not excluding fat.

Speaker 2:          00:40:59       And that's what, that was sort of instructive for this. And now I just basically tried to eat fat all day, Greece, Greece, more grease and if you don't have that hunger. And also I know it's so much healthier for me to not eat bread and to not eat these, we don't eat bad oils anymore. And, and just to tell you another weight loss story, um, my boyfriend, he was elmore Leonard's researcher, the crime writer for 33 years and he had to do this book Djibouti. And I begged him not to go to effort because my boyfriend has his look as I'm American kidnap me and jared is going to get kidnapped that I knew would get kidnapped. I mean he just. Yeah. So I just, you know, I begged him not to kidnap a lot of people in effort. Nobody would kidnap my boyfriend. He's nervous.

Speaker 2:          00:41:42       Was that the pills talking? Is it? No, it's gonna be mad at me for saying this, but he wants, got his pocket picked in Paris. He just looks like the American guy that, you know, do something too. So. And he's a big guy from Detroit so it's not like he's wimpy or anything. Um, but I um, he needed to lose some weight and some doctor gave him these like candy bars that are $230, you know, and, and the thing of like, being from Detroit, not wanting to be ripped off, I said okay, if you do exactly what I say because he's a guy guy so he's not like, you know, I'll do exactly what you say, but I said you will lose weight and you will not be hungry. So I put them on a diet of a bacon, eggs. He could eat meat, no vegetables and just copy and spring water vegetables.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       Yeah. This is like, this is like, remember Dr Atkins, the Atkins Induction Diet, you have to take magnesium or it can be blocked up like the Berlin Wall inside itself. But um, he lost 30 pounds in five weeks while sitting in his chair researching Djibouti. The book delmore ended up doing and he did not leave his chair. He turns librarians on the phone and embassy people and stuff like that. But is no vegetables a good idea? It seems like you need vitamins now eventually. But actually tops has said, we talked about this once and he said basically that meat has all the vitamins except vitamin C and I'm sort of paraphrasing from long time ago, so forgive me if I get this wrong, but. And that if you. But if you are eating meat rather than carbs, maybe you don't get vitamin C deficient, you look at them Osi and also the, the Eskimos. I think it's the nun. I think Stefansson was a guy who was up there and before they started eating a western diet, they just stayed blubber and whale meat and I guess they maybe a penguin here and there. The penguins. Penguins. I think around our cake with a different part of the world and nuggets you, I'm really good on geography. Lincoln say south. I failed geography obviously. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       I know that they, and they also had extremely low rates of cancer and there were just healthier humans. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       It's changed as soon as they started eating the western Diet and Tom's brings up the pima Indians. Same thing. Do they have horrible problems with diabetes? Do also though the

Speaker 1:          00:43:46       to, to throw some other stuff in there. That was also an issue with alcoholism and cigarettes. There's a, the, the cancer and the heart attacks and a lot of the things that happened with the nun. A lot of people, there's a correlation between extreme consumption of cigarettes and alcohol. So it's, it's not just a, the American diet, it's all the vices that go along with that. We're good at producing this. Yeah, we suck. We import horrible things. I mean, liquid we did not. We obviously you and I weren't alive, but whoever looked like us that did that to the native Americans introducing alcohol to them and they, you know, they didn't know what to do with it. Bodies weren't used to it. Yeah. It's, um, there's a doctor, um, that I'm going to have on the soon who is on twitter. I mean, I have no idea if this guy's not a.

Speaker 1:          00:44:36       yeah, everybody is, um, I'll tell you right now, but this gentleman is a, he's a full carnivore. All he does is eat meat and he holds a bunch of records, uh, in a, like athletic pursuits. It's really kind of interesting. You know, this, this Guy Stephen Phinney is it, I'll tell you in a minute, I'll pull them up real quick, but he and I had been going back and forth trying to figure out a time to get him on the podcast, but he's 50 years old and it's pretty impressive what he's been able to do and all he does is eat meat, doesn't eat anything but meat, you know, and he's an md, so of course the fucking Internet's not working here. Going on with the Internet here. Young Jamie month working. Yeah, piece of shit. Laptop. This laptop has been the worst one I've ever had as far as like connecting, like it takes forever to reconnect. Yeah. I hate that anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       I never leave the house. I'm always on my big computer. You never leave the house? Not Lately. I wrote a book for three years that spent three years trying to kill me. So Jesus Christ, my boyfriend brought me food. Otherwise I would've eaten frozen hot dogs for three years. Select the meat guy. But that's not good, right? I wasn't. But the book, you know, what happened. So you plan on writing this book and I thought, Oh, this'll be easier. So this is this book on how to transform to be confident. And um, I thought, okay, this will be easy because I've been writing this in my column for so many years. And then I look into the science and I look a little deeper and I think, oh my God, this is so horrible. And what happens is. So this professor will do these people, these researchers, they do some research but they don't totally support it. And then they don't work in a transdisciplinary way. So you have to support. This one's researched with that one's research and this became this big thing. And I just kept having nightmares about my editor who's a nice man, chasing me down the street asking for my advanced back with an x and x. and x or acts like an x. right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:26       Um, well this guy's A. I don't even know his full name. His uh, his twitter name is s Baker. He is a heroin. When kidding to hear trades. S Baker md is his twitter name, the sport world record holding masters 50 plus athlete nutrition for performance and health, healthcare and not sick care. No medical advice here. And all he does is eat meat. Well, nothing but meat.

Speaker 2:          00:46:52       The Guy I mentioned. So Stephen Finney, he is a dietary researcher. He and Jeff Volek wrote a very good book on low carb. Jeff, Alex, also dietary researcher and Finney I think bicycles competitively or very intensely and he says that I'm eating low carb. There's apparently some hump you get over, but then that is better. It gives you more energy than this whole, like drink some gatorade that people have held as the conventional wisdom.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       Yeah, but it's not the case with like extreme endurance sports and oh there's one guy that we talked about. What do you got here?

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       Sean Baker. Dr Sean Baker, Carnivore Diet Zero carb Diet plan guy looks healthy as fuck. He's on the right hand side. Yeah, he does mean he's jacked and he's dunks basketballs and lift weights and shit. But he might just be some athletic freak.

Speaker 2:          00:47:46       I, I just don't know if it's jeans too. It could be. I'm lucky I have good genes, you know, the boyfriend looks at a saltine and he gained three pounds and I'm lucky. So my family were eastern European should hold Jews and you know, probably wasn't a lot of food and I don't know, somehow my body learn to manage that having lot and having not a lot and it manages it better.

Speaker 5:          00:48:06       Sure. Um, I'm just, I'm wondering whether or not that's a really a viable diet to just eat only meat. It just seems like,

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       well the Messiah do it and, and, and they, and they did it. And so the question is, are you missing nutrients? And I'm not the person to answer this. Are you missing nutrients? And that's the problem with being vegetarian. There's a guy named Chris Kresser who's posted on this. Oh Great. I love this. Yeah. He. And so he has some really good posts about what you're missing. If you provide your tarion and people say, well, I take vitamins, but can you get the vitamins in the way you need in the way your body uses them from taking vitamin pills or even from eating, you have to eat a ton of this, you know, I don't know, being curt or something. Um, and I don't want to have soy. That's the problem. That's the dishonesty. But vegetarianism and some people knowingly make that tradeoff, but I sure wouldn't. I'm sorry. As much as the bunnies are cute and

Speaker 5:          00:48:59       Chris Kresser was a Vegan for a long time and you know, he's had, he had some pretty serious health consequences because of that. But you know, that's just him. Some people were fine with the Vegan diet and that's one of the most important things to talk about is that the, the biodiversity in human beings is very, it is a broad, broad spectrum of what people need and what people don't need. Which is why some people like my friend Brian, his mom can't even touch Brazil nuts. Have she ate a Brazil nut. She'd go into shock and she'd be dead. I mean, I can eat them all day long. They taste like shit. I don't totally like them, but you know, there's, there's a giant curve was

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       right. Yeah. This is the individual differences thing that I was talking about before. And there's, there's this big push to say, oh, men and women are alike and groups are no different from each other, but you know, you don't see Jews as NBA basketball stars and Jews and people from northeastern Europe tend to have lactose tolerance in a way other people do not. So where we are from where we mainly our evolution took place that, you know, and I mean that goes back way, way, way, way back, um, that, um, that affects our skills, our abilities as well as our digestive abilities. You know, can you eat this kind of thing, can you drink liquor and not be really effected by it. All those things. And so that's the stuff that people don't like to look at everyone the way you were talking about before that people like to say it's just like this.

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       It's this thing, this is a disease and it's horrible. You know that, that lack of nuance that's just so stupid and it's so sort of anti solution what people like to do when people do that, that thing of, you know, saying things are one way. It's often in a way too. I think that people try to feel superior who try to simplify things too much. They do that so that too, because we'd like to understand things, so I think it's that. And then also there's a tendency to want to prosecute people to say you are a slovenly fat person and the reason you are a heavy is that you did not go to the gym and I went to the gym and I am a Holy Gym Goer and you are a scummy terribles couch sitter and that's not the case. In fact, tobbs wrote a great piece for New York magazine about how we think exercise makes us thinner, but it doesn't and the reasons you were saying before for doing it for mental health. I try to do that when I'm feeling just my worst. I make myself get on the bike and do these high intensity intervals because I know that that'll help me mentally.

Speaker 5:          00:51:31       No, I feel like I'll be there. Sure. Interesting exercise doesn't make people thinner.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       That's what. That's what tops in this piece says and that's what I see over and over again and believe me, we don't want to believe that and I think people can lose weight through exercise, but they get hungrier. That's the problem. It's not you don't you exercise, you get hungrier and you replace that. I don't have all the nuances on this so everyone should look up that top piece in New York magazine because he's just fantastic and it

Speaker 5:          00:51:55       with all that is, it's very anecdotal. You know when, when you start saying that diet is the way to go and that exercise does not make you thin. It's anecdotal because some people exercise absolutely make some thing. I mean there's. I know a lot of people that have started doing Jujitsu and lost 30, 40 pounds. I know a lot of people that have done that and it works, you know, because it's extremely strenuous, extremely rigorous. She burned off a ton of a ton of calories. You accelerate your metabolism, your metabolism starts burning off fat at an unprecedented rate for your body, and it does work, but it's like, what kind of exercise do you engage? Again, you know, that's, that's another factor, like are you just doing like a long slow jog with very low intensity or are you doing like power lifting? Like there's a lot of evidence that actual weightlifting is way better for burning fat than anything else because when you weight lift, your body makes more muscle, more muscle consumes more calories, and if you have the same amount of calorie intake, but now your body has more requirements, it'll start burning off some of that fat.

Speaker 2:          00:52:57       I think that's a really great point. And I am not one to, that's I'm not, I'm not an expert in this area and I haven't read very much in it, but I have read this. Um, what's the guy's name? Um, shoot, I'm not gonna remember it, Mikey. It's wrote a book with him. It's um, it's slow burn fitness. And actually I do that. I lift weights. You lift them until your muscles are just screaming and I can live like eight pounds because I'm totally wimpy. Um, but um, and you do it really slowly, so slowly, like times barely moving and that does increase your metabolism. It improves your heart, um, improves your cardiovascular system and what's the other thing? And it does help weight loss. So the new one, there are nuances on that. And I just, I say that because when I look at the tops thing, all this stuff, he support stuff very well. It makes sense, but I'm a little light on what the details are. So admittedly, you know, I, I think you bring up a good point on that and also the individual differences, things that we are the thing that we are different and so some people are able to lose weight in ways that other people may be or not. But I think this

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       you see with kids, do you have kids? No, I have kids. And one of the things you see is like, you see kids that can just fucking eat anything. They eat anything and they're skinny and then you see other kids that they're just really struggling on a really early age and their body packs on a ton of fat and they have those extreme endomorph bodies and there's, you know, it's clear differences and, and they, they are both on the playground together at the same time. They're both the same age. You're not dealing with a lifetime of abuse. You're talking about 10 year olds right now.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       So it comes down to me to how does your body process nutrients, how does it process the food you take in and how well does it do it and where does it store it? And so you know, those kids who are, you know the, if you had them do the same kind of play, you will see that one kid ends up being fatter and one isn't and, and it's not, you know, if you fed them the exact same things, you can see that the factories just working differently in one kid had genetics.

Speaker 5:          00:54:57       The other thing to take into consideration, you were talking about lactose intolerance, intolerance. One of the things that I read recently is that a big part of lactose intolerance can be attributed to the homogenization and pasteurization of milk and that you know, we're very concerned about diseases, rightly so, and that's why I'm in freshness and but milk's not supposed to be able to sit on a shelf for three weeks. It's just not supposed to. You're supposed to get milk if you drink it at all, it should be fresh and that way it has the enzymes in it and that what we're doing by boiling this milk and pasteurizing and homogenizing it is where you're creating this dead protein, liquid shit that your body doesn't know what the fuck to do with and then the weirder ones is when you take it and you suck the fat out of it. Like when you have low fat milk and a lot of people don't even realize it. Low fat milk has sugar in it. They literally add sugar to low fat milk to make it palatable. So disgusting. I didn't know that. Not you're not getting anything. It's not. It might be low fat is in fat content, but as in the effects it's going to have on your body, it's not low fat at all.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       Yeah. Actually Jeff Volek, that dietary researcher basically agreed with me when I said to him, so is it basically child abuse to feed your child skim milk? I mean, here we are, America. We're a very wealthy country. People are feeding their children nutrient free food. It's so crazy. Well, there I

Speaker 5:          00:56:14       have not had enough time to study the research. They have to. Most people, they. What they hear is if you eat cholesterol, you'll get fat. If you eat saturated fats, you'll have a heart attack, and there you're talking about like 19 sixties knowledge. You talk to top of the food chain researchers today, no pun intended, in 2017, and they'll tell you quite the opposite. They'll tell you that saturated fats and cholesterol are actually good for you, that they are the precursors for hormones. Your body uses them to produce testosterone, like your body uses them to produce hormones and that this idea that eating cholesterol raises your blood cholesterol. That's not true.

Speaker 2:          00:56:59       Right, and actually we've been so credulous as as people, I think probably it's not just us, it's probably around the globe for many, many decades and now part of the good part of having all this media is that more of the sort of the counterpoint gets out there and so it's been sort of a religion. People have believed this because the government put it out. The American Heart Association, the Ama put it out saying fat is, excuse me, fat is bad. And recently they did it again with capstone. Yet it's so terrible. So not evidence based. It's no

Speaker 5:          00:57:33       send it to a bunch of people like Rhonda Patrick and all the doctors and scientists that I know. I'm like, am I wrong here or is this crap? And on it wrote a piece, one of the researchers for on it wrote a piece of essentially saying the American Heart Association is essentially whack. It's kind of a whack institution and they're not on top of the ball.

Speaker 2:          00:57:51       Yeah. I just found this with another medical association in this piece I'm writing and it's really terrible because what happens is, so doctor say that you go to an Hmo, those doctors, they go by the recommendations of these big associations, so you've got the big associations telling basically medical fairy tales. They're continuing to tell the same fairytale that they've told and people are basing their healthcare decisions on that doctors are and then the patients are listening. They assume, okay, you're wearing a white coat and you went to medical school and I went to school of Google. I guess I'll listen to you and that's really, really damaging and this is why I think Nina Tie Scholtz. I'm Dr Eades, Gary Tobbs, all these people you know who've done this work to put this put out the real science, they have saved an enormous amount of lives and stop people from having horrible diseases. I really think that they're all heroic because it's been a fight to put that stuff out. It's been a big battle for them and they have people fighting them all the time.

Speaker 5:          00:58:50       Well, most people that go to a doctor for advice, but the reality about medical schools, you'd take very little time to learn about nutrition. It's a lot of these guys, whether it's an orthopedic surgeon or the whatever the specialty is, the idea that these people are the goto expert on every single area of the body, including nutritional absorption is ridiculous. It's just not the case and there's a great many people that know more about nutrition and especially state of the art and nutrition. Then your does unfortunately.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       But see if you realize that then you're already ahead of the game and you can say, okay, I'm going to, I am going to use you for tests and tried to sucks. It really sucks. I mean, there are obviously some great doctors out there in the Ken give you some, like, um, my doctor, Dr Gordon, Mark Gordon,

Speaker 5:          00:59:42       he's also an expert in traumatic brain injury and uh, you know, he's a really nuanced guy and when I talked to him about cholesterol and all these different factors and ldl and hdl and triglycerides and he can give me a research based sort of point of view on it because he's doing it himself. I mean he's eating this way himself. He's paying attention to all the latest stuff, but he's got a voracious appetite for that stuff. There's a lot of people that just don't want to be bothered. They got their degree in 1982 and they're done.

Speaker 2:          01:00:12       I know. And it's so terrible. And see if your doctor discloses that to you. If they say, look, I am really known nothing about diet and I'm going to give you advice because they say that I should give you advice, but really it's not based in anything other than they printed out some sheets here. Then okay. Because then you're informed. It's not like your doctor is leading you on with the white coat, but most people are being led on,

Speaker 5:          01:00:33       well, it's just we have this idea, you know, we have this idea that, you know, what, what, what I need to do to be healthy. Well, you know, maybe I should go on a vegetarian diet. That'll be healthy. Well, listen, if you read fucking cupcakes and Burritos and fucking cheese doodles all day. Yeah, a Vegan Diet, it's going to be amazing for you. It's going to really do a great job. The question is, is it optimal? It might be, it might be optimal for you and put it might not be optimal for you. You know, might be for me, maybe it's my thing, you know, but if trying and trial and error becomes really difficult for people because most people have jobs and families and obligations and hobbies and things they like to do. They don't want to spend time going through pub med studies and trying to figure out what the fuck is a good thing to eat and the bad thing to eat and you know, what are the variables? Is it based on, you know, the origin of my ancestors? Do I have to like, think about, you know, those ancestral diet people that are really into that, like, you know, like where are you, where are your people from? Like where did they grow up doing, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       Right. Boy, it's very hard and the great thing is that there, there is more stuff out there that's written for lay people were people who read the research, explain it to people in a way that is very clear and understandable so people can make more of their own decision I think, than they ever could before.

Speaker 5:          01:01:49       It was also people that are super cynical. They're like, hey man, I grew up with Dr Susan. The Food Pyramid was always weed at the bottom and the top was all this other stuff, but now everybody's flipping the food pyramid and you just taken out the bottom part entirely. Like, and so what, what's gonna happen five years from now? You're going to tell me, well, high fat is actually terrible for your brain. Or, you know, it's just people are understandably tired of all this stuff and it's real easy to just sort of compartmentalize and just push it away and listen to your doctor.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       Yeah, it really is. And the thing, the point you made before about the people who are eating the cheetos and cupcakes, Diane, well of course, if you start eating a Vegan Diet, you know, you're not eating cheetos and cupcakes, you know you're going to see an effect. But is that a good effect, you know, in terms of your longterm health and you know, we see that vegetarians don't have necessary proteins that you get very easily from meat with no training

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       to eat, like a balanced amino acid profile. Foods like I know pea protein and hemp proteins. Very good keen keenwah

Speaker 2:          01:02:50       you know, more than I am. This I, this isn't my area because I don't care about that stuff since I'm not vegetarian and wouldn't eat that way, but I see that. So people like Chris Kresser try to help people to say, look, here's the deal. And so you can make some choices and decide, you know, is there a way for me as a vegetarian to get the nutrients I need or am I always going to be deficient and how might that affect my health? So what are the tradeoffs?

Speaker 1:          01:03:15       Yeah. But some people they don't think of it purely as a health issue as well. They also think about it as an ethical and moral issue. You know, they'll say, look, I don't want to be a part of factory farming. I don't want to have anything to do with the death of animals, which I completely understand and I, I respect and appreciate what they're doing is they're trying to leave a smaller footprint on the world. No, that makes sense too.

Speaker 2:          01:03:39       Well, I can see that because I, I mean, I don't think that animal cruelty is a good thing and I think animals should be humanely slaughtered and kept. And so I think that that's a really good argument. I have friends who are vegetarians for that reason, who know about eating meat and and being a healthier way to, to have a diet, but they choose to make that tradeoff and as long as you're making a choice, a reason choice and you know what you're trading off, then I'm fine with that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       Yeah. No, I think that's. And again, for some people vegetarians probably the way to go and that's what gets really confusing. It's like how do you figure out what is the right way to go and what is the for you, I mean, you really, what you're supposed to do is get blood tests. You're supposed to do it on a regular basis. Supposed to consult with someone who actually knows what they're talking about. Yeah. And really just sort of um, just make these choices, test the results, and then make an educated decision based on that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       And here's a problem. How do you find the evidence based doctor? Because I'm in an Hmo so I can just switch doctors forever and ever, but I just stay with the doctor and then read stuff myself because I can do that. That's what I do for a living, um, but for other people who aren't in an Hmo, people want to find an evidence based medicine practitioner. People will say they are, but then you hear the raw what they suggest and they really aren't. And that's, that's a really big problem would be great if there were somebody could make a lot of money maybe doing a site saying, look, I'm this doctor and here's what I look at and think. And um, so you could choose because we tried to find one for my boyfriend in Los Angeles and like, no, nobody knows.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       Right. It's hard. Yeah. It mean they're, they're out there,

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       but it's hard to find them.

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       Yeah, because you tried five or six doctors. You go through them and these are all doctor appointments. You have to pay for them and everything and then you find, okay. You don't know anything really onto the next

Speaker 5:          01:05:28       incredibly time consuming. Like when I go to my doctor, when I get blood work done, we have a 75 minute consultation. We have to sit down for 75 minutes and go over all the various micronutrient levels. And all the different levels of, you know, everything nice and [inaudible] be like, what? And we go over diet and we go over like when are you eating, what time are you eating? Like when, when are you eating, before you take the blood tests and you know, how much water are you consuming? Red hydrated are you. And there's a lot going on me. If you want to truly optimize your health, it's better than ever, but still extremely hard to find someone who knows what they're doing.

Speaker 2:          01:06:05       Let's see. So the doctor you go to that seems like a smart if you are going to spend money because that guy's probably really expensive, but if you're going to spend money, you know, a doctor who sees you for 72 minutes and looks at you, looks at you that way. That seems like a really wise investment in your future. Even if you're maybe somebody who is not, doesn't have money to burn. And that, that seems a really smart place to put it. If you, even if you have to make some sacrifices in other areas.

Speaker 5:          01:06:30       Yeah. No, I think so too. And I think read as much as you can about not just read books by people on nutrition, but read articles about those books, you know, read, I mean pro and con and I've read a lot of con and you know, you've got to go over that stuff with a fine tooth comb. Look for bias, look. And it's hard to do.

Speaker 2:          01:06:49       It's hard. It's really hard to do. Some of the important things are to look at the sample size, look at people, look, look the limitations. Sometimes they'll say them at the end. I always liked those studies that do that sample size, you know, when somebody has had 22 people in this study, you know, that's not the one you want. Look for, you know, and you can't just save necessarily, oh it must be this number or that number. But look for a lot of people. And what else? Like if they say something's really significant, then I'm always, I'm immediately suspicious. Significance, you know, well there's this whole argument about p values and that's probability measure that's going on now and we'll okay, let's take that. Some people are saying, let's take that out of the equation and because that's people are using this as this sort of golden thing to say, okay, we had the spiny and it's fantastic and to look at him to look at the, the, the, the whole study and the findings in a more nuanced way than just the p value.

Speaker 5:          01:07:45       It's hard for people. I mean one of the things that we've talked about a couple of times recently that people keep throwing around is this. These are the recent studies that show that people who eat a lot of red meat are more likely to get cancer and the issue with these studies is a bunch of issues. One, they don't differentiate what kind of meat. They don't differentiate whether or not you eat it with vegetables or whether you eat it with white bread and spaghetti and this huge, whether you're eating grass fed bison or whether they're eating some bullshit burger and you just saying you eat meet five times

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       a week. That doesn't show me what's in your diet. These are called cohort studies and I call them if you see that cohort studies or observational or population based observational study, I call them leap to conclusions after the fact and they're just like the the shit of studies, you know, because did the person, you know, like you're saying, what caused this, this thing that we're seeing, okay, they are there, you know, have this effect. There are healthy foods and it's just, it's such a, it's such a crappy way and you see it reported in the media, you know, these, these articles that say, oh my God, everyone should never eat this type of food ever again. It's terrible for you. And it doesn't say that at all, but the reporters don't know that and they just don't even care. It's just click a bunch of hits on their article and you'll see articles like that that even in like really respectable publications that have this really attractive headline.

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       And then you read the actual article itself, you're like, wait, what are you basing this off? It's really terrible. And so that's the thing, what you said to look at studies. Look at the opposite, the opposite point of view that's really important to look at at, um, it's just, it's hard to read some of these studies. I really appreciate researchers who, right and clear language. I think that's more and more important as people can get studies. There's a site called sky hub where you can get studies that are protected, that the, that the journals don't let you get. Um, and you can find them on professors. Websites are ways to find these studies if you want to find them. Um, you can use google scholar to look up the thing. So it's just a scholar.google.com. And then you can start finding these in, try to get them through other sources if they are password protected because you don't want to just read the abstract because they can say the abstracts that part at the top where they tell you what the study's about, oee, this significant finding and we found this and that.

Speaker 2:          01:10:05       And you will often, not often, but you will sometimes read a study and you'll see that the thing that they say they found is not what they found. And that's why it's important to not just be this lazy person who reads only the abstract and the conclusion, but to look at the methodology and see if there's stuff screwed up. I saw a study done by Harvard professors where they didn't have a control group for their third experiment. And I thought, did you forget? I mean, you're at Harvard, if you guys don't know, to put in a control group, you know, come on. That's a study about, um, it was um, a study on, um, God, I'm not gonna remember now it was, um, mm shoot. It was the third part was in a train station and I can't, I can't remember what the study was about.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       I just, I brought it with me in an evolutionary psychology conference thing, thinking this will be east or write a column from. Because I had a question that kind of matched, um, I can't remember, but it was in a train station and they should have gotten done in a train. They did two, two of the experiments. The first two experiments were where they played videos or something. I think it had something to do with cell phones or something. I can't quite remember. It was someone trying to borrow a cell phone, someone can we borrow your cell phone and so and, and I like these professors. I've referenced one of their, both of their work in my book, my next book, but I'm a psychologist. Study. Yeah. It was social psychology study and I thought, you know that why don't you have a control for third through third experiment.

Speaker 2:          01:11:30       And so then I had to do a new question for my second question, my column and I was all annoyed too so I remembered it. Well there's a difference between science and then headlines from articles that are written about science by people that might not even necessarily be scientists or really truly understand the science. They just want to get an article out there that people are going to pay attention to. Well I'm, I'm sensitive to credentialism is I don't have a phd and I started out giving free advice in a street corner and Soho is a joke. So. But I've. Since then I started out giving advice on a street corner, a little wacky, broad. So what we doing? Well we just had these two friends and we just thought it would be funny. So we set up on the corner of West Broadway and broom with a card table and some folding chairs that advice, it said free advice from a panel of experts.

Speaker 2:          01:12:16       We've called the advice ladies and like love and dating and you know, when, what year did you do? This? Was in the late eighties. And then in the nineties he just decided to do this on a whim. Well, we thought we'd just do it once. I act like I'm drunk at all times. So No, I'm just a weird person and we did this and we just thought we'd sit there and people walk past and laugh because I always liked making people laugh. I once went out in an evening dress and a goatee and a mustache. I'm just to be funny. I frightened to child. Um, and uh, we did this and people, it was New York, you know, free. They lined up around the block and they didn't just ask us like about like their eyelashes or whatever, like, can I get directions to grand street, Grand Street? They were asking a serious question and I thought, Holy Shit, I better know something.

Speaker 2:          01:12:58       And so I read through all of psychology and when you're not reading psychology in school, you think like, oh my God, Freud just made shit up. It was really crazy. And I discovered this guy, Albert Ellis, who was the father at the same time as Erin back of, um, cognitive behavioral therapy basically, and then started reading more and more and immersing myself more and more in science and going to scientific conferences. And then because this thing where I look for people to criticize me so I can get better. I mean not the people who are like, Hey, horror on the internet. But um, I would ask professors like, did I get this wrong? And sometimes they'd say yes. And so I learned more and more and got better and better and incorporated more science. So now what I do is sort of a synthesis from across science.

Speaker 2:          01:13:39       I read a cognitive neuroscience textbook and I use evolutionary psychology. I used that as sort of an underpinning theory to everything. So I look at social science research and say, how would this have made sense in an ancestral environment? Because if it, if there's no sense to it, then there's something empty and wrong with what they're finding or what they're concluding now. So you started out doing this, you set up this card table and free advice and then how did it progress to you having this column? Well, um, so we're doing this and just because it was so fun and we got so much out of it and I learned this, that basically if you help people, if you do kindness to other people for other people, you feel really good. So there's self interest in being kind, especially to strangers. So, and that's what we were doing.

Speaker 2:          01:14:27       And so, um, we did this for a few years and sky walked by, he wrote for The New York Times style section. He belittled teeny piece on us, like, and then it got old cut down Eric Messenger. And then because I'm a governmental Jew, I do like five things well, and one of them selling things. So what does that mean? That means like you're in the garment district, you're like hocking clothing. So I can like get dressed. Notice I don't say like, you know, I get dressed, eat, not cook. Um, what else? Anyway, psychology, that's one of them. And then selling things. And so I got us a TV deal with Deniro, my partners and me. And then I got us a column, the Daily News and a book agent. And one of my partners ended up dying. It's very sad. Um, and so we, um, I ended up doing the column myself at that point, um, and then just syndicated my own column because I thought, well, you know, I'm writing this for one paper, don't make very much money, how do I make more money?

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       And I was an entrepreneur and so I got it in a whole bunch of papers even though all the syndicators who do that. And, and by the way, if anyone asks, it's not possible anymore. Papers are all going out of business. But true, previous, true, be there, they're very, they're really struggling. But back then I went to syndicators. They said, yeah, we think you write a really great column, but Ann Landers, dear abby, of all the real estate, you'll never make any money. And so I went to an alternative weekly newspaper conference in Montreal. I didn't like the Hooker hotel because I couldn't afford the real hotel. And I just went around saying like, here are my little samples here, my little samples. And so paper started picking up my column. So I built a business out of doing this, this out of free advice. And then over the years became increasingly science based, you know, had to learn statistics.

Speaker 2:          01:16:01       I have a book I weep reading under my desk, biosis biostatistics, the bare essentials. I read a lot of stats websites and try to improve in that area in terms of scientific thinking and, and understanding statistics. So I can be better at assessing studies. People gravitate towards advice. They really do the advice columns and advice like call in advice shows like people love, like Dr Laura, like that kind of shit. People call on, you know, what should I do, what should I do? Well, the thing that I do, I, I just feel like I don't have a right to just give you my opinion. Right. So before it was a science base was very reasoned based. I always loved critical thinking and reasoning and logic. And so now you know, I'll look at somebodies question and I'll sometimes think I know the answer, but I'll always read to see.

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       Oh actually no, it's this. I'll read a bunch of papers and I look for what's called the most parsimonious answer because there can be a bunch of answers to something, but it's like what is the thing that most closely narrowly answers this person's question? And then also there's this thing, I see advice columns all the time. They tell someone to do something that nobody would ever do. So I always have like this sort of bullshit check on there of like, come on, it's anybody ever going to do this kind of stuff? Well it's like write stuff down. I write stuff down. Well you know, you might do it. And when people read those books, self help books, it says located okay, right this worksheet and do all this stuff. I've never done that my whole life. And so write things down. No. Well, do you have like a list of things to do?

Speaker 2:          01:17:31       I know I have, I have stuff written. My house is like a, it's a fire hazard with a bed in an oven. It's like a walk in paper pile. So now I write everything down. Actually I type everything out. I, I'm a blowhard and in print. Um, but the thing is that in books, when they say, fill out this worksheet, I like reading, I don't want to stop and do this thing. And so I've never done that. And so in this next book that I wrote, I have two ways to do some delays. Yes. Amy Elk on way or the way that's actually more efficient and will do better. It's the way I changed because I was this loser with no confidence and I transformed myself. And actually it's based in good science. What I did, I didn't know that I was just desperate and miserable. But I say, look, if you make a list of these problems that you have, the things you're afraid of, this will help you, then you can tackle them. This is smarter, but I didn't do that. I still, you know, got to where I needed to go, but it's just dumb to do it my way because you can just do a little writing work and get to um, tackle this stuff you need to tackle,

Speaker 5:          01:18:30       give advice that you don't really take. So like saying like take, write down all the different things that you have issue with and then you can tackle those. You didn't really do that

Speaker 2:          01:18:40       well because I didn't do it based in science. What I'm saying is that I recognize that some people will be too lazy to write stuff down or they just don't do that. And so what I did is I said, here are the consequences if you do it my way, like it's going to be slower and you know, you might not be as successful. And this way it seems worthwhile. Like if I could do this over again, if I, if I had a time machine and go back and say like, Hey, miserable losers person, here's what you do and write this down because then it's going to take you this many years instead of like that many years. I would do that now. And so what I tried to do is persuade people to be smarter than I was basically. Well, you're, you're

Speaker 5:          01:19:18       giving advice based on your personal experience. Like this would have been a better way to.

Speaker 2:          01:19:22       Right? This is a better way. And I see that based on the science, but I realized that some people won't do it. So you can choose. This is the thing. It's like with the Diet, okay, you eat that cupcake, you're going to enjoy it, but here's the trade off.

Speaker 5:          01:19:35       Well, writing things down. One of the things that's important about that is it cements those things in your memory and it puts them in, especially in my opinion, physically writing. I don't know why but like for notes like um, I have notes on my phone that I keep from like comedy sets of like things that I need to do, but they're not as effective as a notebook. I keep a notebook as well and my notebook is not where I write in. I ride on a computer, but my notebook is where I write things down that I need to remember like this, the subject of bits and the important points in bits and maybe even if it's a new bit, I'll go over the important punchlines and where they fit in and I'll write all this stuff out. But that way, like for some reason when you physically write things down, they get cemented in your mind. The act of putting pen to paper and moving your hand around

Speaker 2:          01:20:28       it makes sense. See, this is the, this is the subject of my next book. It's embodied cognition. It's that we don't just think with our mind that our body is intimately involved and so. And there is research that finds you are actually going to remember stuff more if you write it down. That's why they say in class you should take notes in pen and ink rather than typing. And so the truth is, I mean, I've lived all over my house. It's just that self help book genre that I never wrote anything in where they said to write stuff, but I think that that's very important and also for memorization, um, that, that's, that's an important thing that to write stuff when I have, I did a Ted talk and I had to memorize stuff for it and I can see where I wrote stuff on the pages. So I had the type pages. But then I had stuff where I scratched and notes and I can picture that still. Even now, even though I don't have the greatest memory, I don't think the places that I wrote notes in this colored ink, there's something very memorable about that where it isn't with the type page.

Speaker 5:          01:21:27       Yeah. I don't know what it is, but it definitely works. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:21:30       Well, the physical is very important. You know, if you look at people who are, you know, feel bad about themselves, they sort of hunched down and everything. There's a different way of standing if you feel good about yourself and good about where you're going and walking going forward. I mean all of these things are very important. If you are depressed, it really can help to take a walk and this is this kind of thing where you have to force yourself. It's like when I forced myself to get on the bike, you know, I want to do anything but that, but I know that I just have to do it because I'll feel so much better. Not just then, but the next day it seems to, I see an effect on mood the next day, you know, with this thing in Vegas, I got very just in a dark place that did that day that happened and I just made myself get on the bike and it's the time I've felt least like that. And I mean like how dumb because all these people are going through this horrible stuff. And I'm like, oh, I couldn't get on a bicycle. But. But it really is. You have your own little world. That's where you inhabit and you have to take care of it. And that was what I did to just not. I didn't want to go into a depression.

Speaker 5:          01:22:32       Well, it's also a habit that's a good habit to form the habit of getting too off your ass and putting action, doing something right. And sometimes it's hard for people that you know, you can call it procrastinating. I saw, I don't want to do or to think about not doing it. You have to get in the habit of just doing things, getting the habit of getting up and doing where there's. There's no option. You don't have the option to not do it. Force yourself to do it. And if you can do that, you will appreciate your free time so much more. If you people think that like, well I just like being lazy and I like relaxing, sitting around

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       you. You May, I believe you may, but you won't like it as much as you would like it if you've accomplished your goals first. See are so great. Because then you feel good about something. You've done something, you feel good sitting on the couch. I like sitting on the couch. Sometimes I'm watching TV, but it's because I work so much, I get shit done. So when I put my feet up I can like, feel good. I'm not fucking off. I'm enjoying leisure time, which is also important. There's this classic social science research by this Guy Carl Wyke who talked about small wins and that's really important and they talk about that in a make your bed in the morning and, and the thing you were talking about with feelings, I'm a big advocate of not letting your feelings be the boss of you. That's how I say it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:46       Um, and so for example, I write to a timer because when I sit down to write, so my stuff is funny. So I always think like I'm not funny, I have nothing to say. I don't know what the science, I don't know what the answer is. That's, those are those immediate feelings buzzing around like little flies and my head and it doesn't, none of that matters because the time, right? Put on 52 minutes on 17 minutes break and that's all that matters. How many times do you read a day? Um, uh, it depends on the day because sometimes there's 17 minutes for break. Well do that. And I do. Dean, how'd you come to that? Actually, I read something, I didn't even read this study. It just, I thought, oh that sounds good. There's this thing called a pomodoro where you do 20 minutes, but that doesn't seem like very much, you know, with the humorous stuff sometimes if it's hard I have to just keep shooting the shit with myself and like looking up things on the internet like oh look, a polar bear, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:32       And, and come up with some kind of joke or something like that. And so it takes a while. And I read this somewhere saying that 50 to 17, but I didn't even read the paper on it. I didn't just run with that. Right. We'll run with that. And so what I do often in the 17 minute break period, especially if I'm doing something really hard is um, I will clean my house and I, I wish I could, you know, no one pays writers anymore. So I'd actually like to have a team of maids and a butler, a little midget butler, I don't know, for Nola to save. Oh, okay. A little person. Sorry, little person Butler. Why a little person? How about a giant? Because I always love the wizard of Oz. I think that they're amazing looking. Um, so that's probably a terrible thing and I'm probably going to be happy.

Speaker 3:          01:25:12       You have people like come after me and the, what does this champion would just pull up? Pomodoro is, I've only heard of it and a time cooking. So yeah, right, right. It comes out of that little, the little tomato timer. It's 20 minutes. So each 25 minute block of work as a Pomodoro. Once you thought it was 24 pomodoros take a longer break of 20 to 30 minutes. This will help your brain relax and refocus before your next session. So this is default mode processing that goes on. What happens is you're more efficient if you take breaks. See I'm from the family of the puritan work ethic. Jews of like, you know, the just the beat the horse and have it worked for hours, but that's really inefficient because your brain does background processing while you're doing this, you know, you're washing the dishes or whatever and so, but I find that the thing about not having a maid and doing the work yourself, you like cleaned the base board down here or take the little

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       clorox wipe and do something. You have these small wins so you accomplished something even though it's just a little tiny thing. You clean your countertop or whatever with bleach that you've done something and where maybe you're writing, it's going, it's frustrating and you haven't really accomplished much. He didn't figure out the thing you needed to figure out. So you have that elevated feeling of being, having done something that you're talking about. I've heard a lot of people say they like to take breaks and walk during the walking. That's when they sort of sort out all the different things they were writing about and they usually bring a phone or a recorder and then they talk into it if they have an idea and then go over that or you know, obviously. Do you use the transcription? You have a smartphone use at transcriptional. I that dragon thing on my phone, which I really like.

Speaker 2:          01:26:47       The walking does seem helpful. Nietzsche walk and I've read papers on this that walking is helpful and so I do that also if I have something that's just where I can't figure something out, what I do is I go to the bank and get $20 out just to. So it doesn't seem like a meaningless trip there and then come home and go to the bank to get 20 bucks really? Well it's near my house. It's like on Lincoln and I walked back and you know, it's a short trip, but it's enough of a walk that it's a walk and a symbolic thing of getting the money out if it has no meaning, it's just that, you know, if I just walked to the bank, it would feel purposeless than then maybe I wouldn't do it the next time. So it feels like I know I'm a weird girl, what can I say?

Speaker 2:          01:27:27       Um, but I do that. And that's just such a, it's sort of alleviate some kind of debt that pressing feeling of you have. Like there's not a solution I don't know. And you're moving, you're doing this thing where you're moving forward. That's this thing about your brain, not just, we don't just think about solutions. Like we can actually move in ways that help your brain be more powerful. And that's that the walking thing that seems to be one of these ways where you take some pressure off and actually that. And I put things on the wall in my shower, correct things, and I also put up things I don't understand to look at them over and over again. And the other thing too is people feel bad if they are not instantly geniuses at figuring something out. And what I like to do is go over and over and overthink.

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       So on this thing that I'm writing now, this medical care expo say that I'm writing now. The research is really new to me and complicated. And so what I do is I have a pile of papers. There's a step stool in my bathroom. It's really crazy. My boyfriend goes in there and he sort of frightened by the insanity but the pile of paper. So I put them on the bottom stool and then I reread them and I put them on the top. So there's like a. it's like an escalator going back and forth. Because when you do it like that, you get sort of a deep understanding that you don't. When you just read it at first. And I know this from writing that there's an understanding I can listen to somebody present their work at a scientific conference and understand it, but can I explain it to you? And that's a whole different level of understanding that's deeper understanding that that does make sense. And when you're talking about walking to

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       do, what do you think the walking has an effect also because it's a mild, very mild exercise, so it's not exhausting you, it's not hard, but you are getting some good circulation because you're forcing your body to pick your legs up and move forward and your heart starts beating. And, and I think it sort of a ignites some systems.

Speaker 2:          01:29:19       Yeah. I think that you're probably right about that and you feel just the sense, you know, because you're going forward so forwards a metaphor for success and progress and all these things. And I think that all of that, it sounds kind of silly, but I looked at all this metaphor stuff and I don't think it's so silly, you know, uh, you know, uh, success is up, moving forward as progress. And so our bodies are connected, our first language as organisms, the organisms, they had two things, approach and avoid. It's like, oh look, a yummy piece of plankton, I'll approach that, or oh, that thing's gonna eat me and I'll back up. And those, um, it's called, there's a term called neural reused by the Sky Anderson and another guy named dot Haynes said it in different way, but the, the idea is that the human emotional system comes out of her scalp.

Speaker 2:          01:30:09       They use a term scaffolded, I don't think they use it right, but it's comes out of the approach and avoid mechanisms of tiny organisms. So going forward, that's approach going backward, receiving that's avoid. Um, and so if you look at it that way, it makes sense that walking, that going to the bank, I'm going to walk in a little tennis shoes in my word, those Asian pullman sunglasses that, you know, I'm going somewhere. I got them from my neighbor, she's Japanese at a garage sale. This Asian Pool, man, they're like those wraparound. It's basically like putting a strap, you know, how they, um, like if they don't want to you, I identified in a photo, they put a black bar over your face that's like the sunglasses version, but they're huge and they're plastic and it's like, I need a car. Windshield. I got them at her, you know.

Speaker 2:          01:30:54       Oh, also because. So I'm, I'm just like, I'm related to white out. And so, um, I'm just hoping to not age like an old Hermes handbag, you know, by even California. So you spray like a sunscreen all over your face when you do that too. No, I use FDA banned sunblock. Jesus Christ. Why would you do that? No, because I know the FDA, they're wrong to bend this. They don't allow the most protective sunblock, which is with [inaudible] that they sell in France, that no French people have not been dropping dead in the streets. They haven't been dying of cancer from using sunblock with his very protective ingredient. The FDA allows the sunblock now to be sold here. It's called anthea. Anthea Leo's. But it's like with the whatever Musinex I used to take that they know have behind the counter and they sell the one up in the aisle, that doesn't work. They removed the active ingredient and they sell the lesser ingredient in America. So if you want to get the Antonios that actually works. You have to go to France. I buy a case when I'm there are other people bring back a dress? I bring back $350 worth of sunshine. You can't even order it online and have it. No, you can. Well this is a great thing about the Internet nowadays. You spell it. Anthea, it's a n, t h

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       e l I o s and there's a little French accent. Excellent. Accent. A goose. That's the only thing I wanted to say if you were French and Taleah. Antonio's. Yeah. Okay. So this stuff is just way stronger than anything you get here in America. Well, it's this oral. That's the ingredient that protects you from UVA and UVB. And it's just, it's really the, the most protective ingredient. You can also get it in Canada. I got someone, I was in Vancouver, you know, but um, I get it in France because I can get it cheaper there so I buy a whole case like I caught you go to a bad neighborhood and buy it there and some like Yucky pharmacy there. So when you're taking this stuff, like what is the difference between that and so like coppertone or something that you would get in America?

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       Well that doesn't. I think it doesn't protect. I can't remember whether it's Uva or uvb that it doesn't protect against fully the kind with the titanium dioxide protects. But also the other problem with these sunblocks has set, you know, do they affect your endocrine system in terrible ways? I don't know, but I'm so vain that I just don't want to be, you know, like look like a sheep dog by the factor into consistent. Well because you're putting these chemicals on your skin and stuff goes into your skin. But again, I haven't gone outside and a long time. So that sort of the effect. So a huge hat like that, you know, it could be a witch, a black hat and that helps to kind of crazy. Amy. I am, I'm nuts. It's one of my better qualities I guess, or worse. But uh, that's a, that is an interesting point about, uh, affecting your endocrine system that I never really took into consideration.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       I've been thinking about sunscreen, you know, like, because I was reading this thing about um, the great barrier reef being destroyed by sunscreen and a spray sunscreen in particular over someone. Someone sent me this message and I don't know if it's correct that the spray sunscreen is the issue with reese and not the put the rub on stuff. Good. I hate to be a feminist. I don't know if that's right. See, see if you could find out. You did see something. I remember looking at stuff recently and it wasn't true, but I'm looking up again for whatever reason, there's something in the Aerosol version that is more dangerous for reefs, but it Kinda makes sense. I mean, you're putting this fucking skanky chemical on you and then you're jumping in the water. I mean, where's it going? Yeah. Well it seems though that both kinds would work that way, but maybe it's because the lotion kind probably absorbed more into your skin.

Speaker 3:          01:34:26       Hair goes, no, your sunscreen isn't good. And the world's coral reefs. Varying studies. I've found those so that I don't know if this one is even accurate, but I found two other ones that said it is burying studies produced by the sons. I believe that is it. Click Bait. I don't care. Scroll up and let's see what it says. Get a little larger there. Thank you sir. Swimming that swimmers that slather themselves and sunscreen or doing their skin a favor, but it might not be so helpful to any nearby coral reefs that claim released in a recent scientific study sparked global headlines,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       faulting sunscreen for the global decline of these hot beds of biodiversity. It's disturbing idea that something so necessary for protecting humans from skin cancer could be doing so much environmental damage, but what weight should we give? The scientific finding? Not much. Turns out the authors of the report who hail from labs and universities in the US and Israel found that. How do you say that? Oxy, Benzos, Benzos, an active ingredient in some sunscreens that protects against ultraviolet light, is present in significant quantities around recent Hawaii and the Virgin Islands that were favored by swimmers and divers. They determined that the chemical has a detrimental effect on the DNA of coral in both its juvenile and adult stages. The study was published in the Journal Archives and environmental contamination and toxicology. The lab, the researchers exposed core in the lab. The research is exploring exposed coral to high concentrations of oxybenzone. Not only did it deform coral larvae by trapping them in their own skeleton. The study found that it was also a factor in coral bleaching. Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council, Center of Excellence Crow. He studies at James Cook University told Mashable, Australia, he thought the report's findings were inconclusive. He was paid off. His particular study was done in a laboratory, so they actually used artificial seawater. He explained they put tiny bits into coral in aquaria and then added some chemicals. It's not surprising, the coral didn't like chemicals thrown at them. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:36:32       See, this is a good point and this is something when you look at studies, this is one of the things I look at. They call it in Vivo or in vitro, you know, are you looking at stuff, do they pull out some cells and do something to them and does that replicate or not replicate what, what happens in the human body? Are there other things, other reactions going on that are missing from them? You know, when you, when you do that, when you pull it out and just look at it in a petri dish. Yeah, I would imagine, but it seems like in that environment it showed that the coral does not like it. I mean I would imagine that that's not terribly surprising, but I'd like to know

Speaker 1:          01:37:08       what are the trace amounts that they're seeing in coral and can they mimic those and studies or are they just pouring it on them and you know, like salt for instance, right? If you put a little bit of salt in your food, you're going to be fun. You eat a pound of salt, your big dead an hour.

Speaker 2:          01:37:22       Well, this is the thing that, you know, if you look at studies, this is why it's important to read them over and over like that and to really pick them apart if you want to assess them any sort of reliable way because you have to look at those nuances and think, well wait a second, I called this thing to leave the lab syndrome where you look at something, they've studied something you think like that's not how it works in real life. Why are you doing the experiment that way? That's completely dumb and so, and this is stuff you don't have to be a scientist, but you can. It helps to think scientifically to think logically and so it's always good to enhance that thinking so you can look at that, look for the bullshit.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Yeah. But for a lot of people they just see that headline, Oh, coral reefs dying because of Sunscreen, sunscreen bad. Right? And we'd like to blame people and I felt bad when you've said that. I felt like I sucked. Damn it. I'm out there killing just for my skin, so will look like an old hag while also cancer, lung cancer. Well, see, here's the thing though. There's so much stuff, so much is more complicated than we think. Am I giving myself problems by not getting vitamin D the natural way and by taking a pill because I take a little pill, so that's one of those tradeoffs and I think like, okay, I eat a ketogenic diet and then I put on the sunscreen and you look at all that and you try to make the best guests you can. That works also within what matters to you as a woman.

Speaker 3:          01:38:38       I don't want to look really haggard, you know when I'm 65 or you're supposed to Scotland or something. If you look at your students, you're supposed to be in some marsh somewhere, right? Exactly right. Exactly. Guy like a giant sunscreen thing and so you know when, when you change these things in a modern environment, they call it evolutionary mismatch. You know, what are you doing? Are you screwing yourself up in some way because you aren't getting this nutrient or whatever it is, the way your body evolved to take it in? Yeah. It is such a weird thing. The color of people's skin is really just because we changed environments, right? That's, that's the whole. The whole race thing is so thrown out the window when you take that into consideration. The way we look, the shape of our noses, the shape of our faces, the shape, the color of our skin, all determined by the environment that our ancestors.

Speaker 3:          01:39:33       Great. And then all of these people who are say Irish, they all grew up in this place and so they are characteristic Irish features and and it's just an accepting me. See what what's happened now is we can't make jokes anymore. I skated with 20 black guys in New York. Oh, I stopped the thing you said about the football thing. I thought, okay, I earn a living writing and I really can't do a lot else that if I cracked my head open, I might not be able to earn a living ever again. But these guys, they called me white out, which I thought was hilarious. Yeah. And, and when you are not racist, I mean it's not, it's not bad to joke about race, racial stuff, but now I mean it's just really the third rail of everything that you even say the slightest thing. You make mention that someone's different color.

Speaker 3:          01:40:18       I mean forget it, but also there's no negative connotation to being white. Right? So when you say you're wide out, it's not bad. It's not like a charcoal, like Ooh, that people use charcoal. Charcoal doesn't seem like an insult. And also black people don't seem chocolate. I thought I had a black boyfriend. He had chocolate. His skin was the color of Toklas Espresso or black super black. Well, I think that what really dark, beautiful. Those people from from Africa. I do too with that gorgeous. They're amazing. Until they started putting plates in their lips to draw the line. Weightlifting. How do you kiss someone like that? You lick the plate. Like is there food left on the plate? Sorry. Well that's what is. That is one of the weirdest spanky's. What's they're called Ubank. Jeez, I think the people will like that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:41:06       Surrey. That's the part of Africa that they do that I believe that seems like one of the weirdest sort of habits or behavior patterns that people have ever adopted where it's weird, one of the weirdest cultural traits. It's just passed down from generation to generation and the larger the plate in their lip, the more cattle they're worth when they get married. God super twisted. It's like, how did that ever come about?

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       No idea. I don't know that area down there, but God, that's some of these cultural things that go on are really crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       Well, whenever you see body mutilation or which is essentially what that is, um, I've, I've read that also being connected. Um, and it's very vague now. I'm trying to remember it, but I remember it being connected somehow or another to the slave trade and that they've made these women less likely to be raped. Oh, interesting. Yeah. I don't know if that's true though. Still. I probably shouldn't say it, but I do always hear things. I don't know if they're true. I just repeated and let people sort it out. Google it, folks, don't listen to me.

Speaker 3:          01:42:11       But when you were saying about white people before it now actually, I mean, you see this probably all over twitter to this thing of white privilege and there this, uh, I guess I react when I was like 18, it was like typhoid, you know? And um, and so now if you're white, you're just guilty. Yeah. You know, there's nothing you can do and you see this, there's some, there was a video, it was in Berkeley, some social justice guy and the woman just, it was like, there's basically, I mean, that's what she said. There's nothing you can do. You're guilty. I wish I could remember the word chef or white privilege. Yeah, right. Oh, odd. God. Fun. I love that.

Speaker 1:          01:42:48       Yeah, I. But it's what, it's a way to silence people and it's also a way for you to be guilty of something. Whether or not you're, you know, you getting to have a clean slate. You are all on the defensive instantaneously. You are, you are already a guilty person. So they can virtue signal. They can decide that you know, you, you need to be punished or you need to be. Your opinion is invalidated because of the Melanin content and your scan. I mean

Speaker 3:          01:43:12       crazy. It's the antithesis. I Love Martin Luther King and let's say the content of your character and that's so beautiful and it just, it's, it's so terrible, this thing of you're white and you're wrong, and people don't understand. That's the same thing as the, the, the racism that's been done to blacks, you know, for so, so long. And I mean, I'm just, I'm sort of stunned by that and this idea. I mean, basically you're racist is now shut up. That's what you did. You pay attention to what went on in Evergreen State College in Washington state. I love that guy, Brian Steen. Oh my God. He's my hero. And what happened was they were. People don't know. They essentially said we're going to have a. They used to have a day of absence

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       of people of color and the idea is it's a very progressive school and they said, look, if we have a day where people of color or people of varying ethnic people aren't white, essentially that's what it is. They don't show up maybe where they will be appreciated more and maybe we will take them into consideration more what for their absence will be felt, so then they decided let's flip that around and force white people to stay home. White staff members, white teachers, white students, and Brett was like, you're out of your mind like this is racist. It's one thing that you want to call attention to the value of people of color by not being there, which is also arguably not the best way to handle it, but at least you're not saying to someone that they cannot be there because of the color of their skin, which is what you're saying. By forcing these people to. And then obviously all hell broke out. You know? People were protesting him. They were. They were looking for him with baseball bats. The whole thing is horrific, but it's this escalation, this war of ideas where you're forcing your ideas and your shouting people down and calling people guilty before they've ever done anything, which is essentially what this is all about. And you know, now he's not at school anymore and then school is imploding. I mean, it's really crazy

Speaker 2:          01:45:10       and actually I would argue that, you know, for, for people who are of color too, to make a protest by not going to school for a day after people fought so hard. I love that. That little girl, the picture of the girls in little rock going to school, you know, were they segregated? They desegregated the school. Imagine being a little girl and that's you going with these police officers to school or going crazy and, and to value in education and to not to skipping school. Okay, so then beyond that, Bret Weinstein said his argument was, I think this is racist and let's not do it, and let's talk about it. And his speech in the hallway, they're outside his classroom. I saw him and I thought, wow, this is an amazing guy. Look at how rationally is measured and calm and full of grace in, you know, there's this mob there, you know, you're calling them racist and shouting him down.

Speaker 2:          01:46:03       Him Down and I thought, oh my God, I want to study with the sky. Can you please do a mooc on Coursera so I can take a class from you and learn how to do what you do in a heated situation. Nick Nicholas Christakis at Yale is another one who had people screaming at him and was just a class act, you know, and just as crazy and they've lost. So you'd lost Bret Weinstein from Evergreen. He is. I mean, this guy was a valuable guy to have there and it's so sad that he is now. It just wasn't safe for him when they're there with baseball bats. I mean, it becomes a circus. You. It's no longer about education. You can see why he couldn't go back and his wife too. It's very sad. Very, very sad. But this is what's happening. That they're not allowing discussion. This idea, that accusation of your racist.

Speaker 2:          01:46:49       This is now just this thing. It's a just giant muscle. You're supposed to shut up, just listen to what it is, is a giant muzzle just shut up and it's a way to silence you and it's a way to force their ideas down your throat and you bring something up there. I call it a way to have unearned power over other people. And so I think that part of this, the NPC part is that we have kids go to college who are not prepared for college and this is especially true if you go to some terrible school, not if you're the child of wealthy parents who got all the sat training and everything like that, but so you get promoted because they want a certain color face in there. So maybe you do okay at Duke, but they send you to Harvard because you can get in there because they're like, oh, we have all these Asian people.

Speaker 2:          01:47:30       Screw you Asians, we're going to like kick you out and not admit you and will admit the craziest thing. Racist. It's so terrible. So maybe that, if you could clarify that because people don't know what you're talking about. So what they do? Yeah. Policies Against Asians, admission policies, so Asians, I mean, I think it has to do something with the culture and the family there. There's um, you know, if you're Asian. I had an Asian assistant before she lived at home with her mother, father and her sisters and her grandma. You know, grandma answered the phone. You didn't speak Korean, she hung up on you. But there was a very strong work ethic that you must succeed. There were very strong family ethics. It wasn't a single parent household. And that's what happens to a lot of these at risk kids. I speak at a school.

Speaker 2:          01:48:10       I created a program to try to help kids make it by showing example, like saying, look, here I am. I failed. I slept on a door in New York on two milk crates. I'm not from a wealthy family. You have to be creative apprentice to somebody. All this stuff. Kids don't get that. They don't get that. If you're, if you grew up in a bad neighborhood and your parents don't model that sort of work ethic and the possibility to hope for success, well why should you think there would be any hope for you and why should you work? Because it's a little off track. Okay. Sorry. Getting off track. The standards for standards for Asians, so they say, oh look, all of you Asians, we have too many of these Asian faces here. It's so terrible and so we're not going to admit you were going to take the standards.

Speaker 2:          01:48:49       Standards for Asians are going to be much higher than for everybody else and so if you get this grade point, say it's like a three point eight and you're Asian, forget it. You're out. But if you are this person of this face color that we want, we're going to put you in there even though you know you have the same grade point as somebody we're kicking out. Sorry to ramble. I do that, but that's what it is. It's like the. They have higher standards for admission, like they've essentially put the bar higher for them and it's racist. It's racist, it's terrible discrimination against a minority, right? And they are a minority and it's terrible. And so what I hear minority than African Americans and bigger minority than Hispanics and Latinos. It's a big minority in America. I was thinking, I was nodding and then I thought, are they?

Speaker 2:          01:49:33       Oh, that's really interesting. Oh, so what I suspect, and I could be wrong, this is just a guess on my part, is that when you are promoted to a place where maybe you aren't capable of succeeding, um, that maybe possibly you, instead of putting your energy into succeeding, you put your energy into protesting and saying the system is terrible and racist and unfair because that is the way that you become somebody and you have power and everything. If you can't get it through the, okay, I'll work hard. Um, the way, which isn't to say, so people think that when you say that, you're saying, oh, this group of people, they're stupider or worse than other people. But if you go back to the schools, if you help those kids, this is what they're doing with charter schools. If you give those kids what they're missing there, there isn't.

Speaker 2:          01:50:19       You know, we're, we're individuals. You can help people who might have been throwaway people to succeed. If they just see, look, it's possible, and here, how do we put the stability? Or are you. You're a child of a single mother that comes with it comes with certain risks. If you grow up in a certain kind of risky neighborhood, there's a whole area of evolutionary psychology called life history theory that talks about this. It's called having a fast life history strategy. It's adaptive. If you grow up in a risky, terrible neighborhood where things are unstable to get pregnant early, if you're a male, to be violent. All these these things that aren't helpful in our modern society, but they're kicked off by that unstable, unstable environment where you grow up. So okay, if instability is a problem, we can't just say, okay, you're single mothers should go back in time getting a time machine and go find a man and marry somebody before she has you.

Speaker 2:          01:51:11       That's not realistic. We can't throw away people and that's what I see people advocating some times. You know, like, okay, well we've got to tell people to not get pregnant without a, you know, a family structure, people that they're not going to understand human nature and so because they've done that, you don't punish the kids. How do we give those kids to stability? They lack and I think one of the ways is to have people going from the earliest grades and model what, for example, my parents modeled for me as these suburban, not wealthy, but just sort of middle class suburban people work hard, do this, do that, and you will be okay.

Speaker 5:          01:51:45       Also the problem with the Asian folks in universities is they don't complain and the squeaky wheel gets the grease and these people aren't protesting and aren't screaming that it's racist. What they're doing is they're putting their head down, they're working and they're working hard and that's a part of their culture. You know, I grew up with a lot of Korean kids and they're extremely hard working to the point that I would feel like a lazy fuck when I was around them and one of my good friends when I was a kid, my friend junk, he was. He was doing his residency for medical school. He was also competing on the US national taekwondo team. He was going to school all day long and then he was training two to three hours a night. His kid was a fucking maniac and I would be around him and I just felt so lazy no matter how hard I worked, it was so late, but he never complained about anything ever.

Speaker 5:          01:52:35       And it was the culture. The culture was to never complain, just to work hard and never complained. And you're seeing that in universities, you're seeing that with their results, but you're also seeing that with the that even though they're discriminated against, like racially discriminated against by universities, no one's complaining about it. So they continue to do it. So they do, and they do it under the guise of diversity because so many of these Asian people are so successful in their academic careers, they doing so well and getting into schools, they're pushing them out to try to balance it out, but that doesn't balance out shit and whatever you're doing is you're encouraging this sort of weird way of looking at people. You know you're not, you're not you. You want equality of outcome. Okay? If that's not real, you know, equality of opportunity is real.

Speaker 5:          01:53:20       Equality of outcome is not real. It's just people. The equality of outcome happens when everyone works the same amount and this is the thing about a free society that people don't like to understand, but when you have inequality, inequality is by in many ways because of freedom, because you have the freedom to choose to work as much as you want or as little as you want. You're going to have inequality and outcome and there's other factors for sure. There is absolutely discrimination. There's sexism, there's racism is always different factors that play into account as well, but there's also effort and to deny that and tonight that effort is a factor in the outcome is preposterous and it sets up this fantasy land that so many kids live in today. While they're protesting. Ben Shapiro calling him a fucking Nazi. That's where it all comes from. That there's these, you know, these. You have a campus, these, these kids that are trying to shut down Republican speaking on campus by calling them and these blanket statements. They're white supremacists and racists. Like, okay, well what about Ben Carson? He's a fucking Republican too, and he's black. There's a lot of people that are black that are republican is a preposterous way of looking at the world and it's this sort of isolationist view and it's. It's weird. It's weird that they don't see how racist it is to discriminate against

Speaker 2:          01:54:41       Asian people. It's terribly racist and also if you look at what real diversity is, to me, it's bringing in people who didn't have economic advantage because these, the people who have a hard time, it doesn't matter if they're black or white, you know, I know I have a number of black friends who are highly successful. Some of them are researchers and they grew up in suburban neighborhoods. They grew up like I did. They had a family. Their family was intact, you know, they didn't need a leg up from anybody because they did what I did, which is work hard. My mother told me, so I grew up a Jewish kid in an neighborhood with no Jews and they like Egged her house and everything like that. My mother said to me, you know, there are people who hate Jews, so you're going to have to work harder than other people because some people are going to be prejudiced against you and try to keep you out. So that was a message, not, oh, we should whine about this and isn't this terrible? His murderer issues my parents can be.

Speaker 5:          01:55:30       Yeah. It's. I don't know. It's. It would be really beautiful if everybody just did the Martin Luther King thing, right? Just judge people in the content of their character, not the color of their skin, not the origin of their birth or their ancestors birth,

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       but unfortunately we are tribal and we do have these weird tendencies to sort of lump ourselves together. And by the way, for people that are listening to this, to disagreeing, if you're a fucking social justice warrior, your tribal too. If you're, you're a radical lefty, you're fucking tribal. That's, that's a tribal outlook, you know, and we would all be better off if we were a little, a little bit more balanced. Me included.

Speaker 2:          01:56:05       Well me included to. I mean, and if we listen, what I try to do is to look at the other side, you know, the style side I don't agree with like you were talking about this before where you maybe see things, you see their point or you look at stuff that you want to agree with. There was a nick kristoff thing. I'm a piece on, okay, here's what we have to do with guns. And I looked at it because we all want, there's this idea of like do something, we want to do something but something is not a good thing to do. And I looked at his piece wanting to find something in there that would say yes, we just do these things in every single thing in there. It was all meaningless stuff that wouldn't have stopped the guy in Vegas. And so I looked at that wanting to see something and you see nothing. And so it's the thing of being honest, being intellectually honest and honest when your site is full of shit too.

Speaker 1:          01:56:53       Yeah. And you know, when it comes to something like the thing in Vegas, we want to find some sort of solution when it doesn't necessarily exist. There's so many different factors. I mean obviously the access to weapons is a big one. That's a huge one. And to deny that it's silly to deny that on the right, like the people that are massive second amendment proponents like to deny that the access to weapons has no factor in someone using those weapons is pretty fucking stupid. I mean, it doesn't make any sense, but then to say that those weapons should not be accessible to people who are not criminals. That's also weird because you're saying like, well, what if you have. If we have laws in this country that allow a person to go and buy a gun for personal safety and then something like this happens where people get shot and murdered by some crazy person and then you take those rights away from the people who have done nothing wrong. That's not good either. I mean,

Speaker 2:          01:57:48       yeah, it doesn't stop it either. Look at the Charlie Hebdo thing in France. They don't allow guns in France. I don't even know if the policemen armed. I don't think they are different

Speaker 1:          01:57:56       thing. Right? Because that's Muslim extremists that we're acting on religious

Speaker 2:          01:58:00       pulses, but they got guns. They got horrible, horrible guns that killed people. I mean it at that. I think they might've even been automatic weapons. I mean I don't want to use that term because I don't know anything about guns, so I probably just use that wrong, but they don't allow guns in Francis. They got them and I think that criminals, I live near the hood, you know, you can get whatever drug you want, you know, and the coroner. Can you get that through my adderall? Um, you know, maybe. I don't know. Good question.

Speaker 1:          01:58:29       Access is it's way. Look, Australia is a perfect example. They had one mass shooting. They rounded up all the guns. They haven't had a single one sense, you know, but Australia also has less people than Los Angeles and it's huge. It's the size United States. So you know, there's, there's a, there's a discussion to be had for sure and along you know, the way we need to discuss access to firearms. That's a part of that discussion. But you know, I talked about it the other day with my friend Alonzo Bowden and immediately people were put making articles saying that we are calling for a police state and confiscation of the guns. I didn't say that. No one said that, but this is the right wing, you know, second amendment proponent, knee jerk reaction to an instantaneously demonize anyone is critical of the guy having the access to 23 fucking rifles.

Speaker 2:          01:59:17       Right? And see the thing that that's happened with the polarization is that now just saying, let's think about this, you know, because I'm libertarian, I'm pro second amendment, but I also think, let's look at this. That's not bad to say, let's look at this. This doesn't mean we're going, we want to take away everybody's guns. It means that we want to think about things as it's ever been a clear.

Speaker 1:          01:59:38       There's a giant problem with someone having access to guns like that. Show it to me because this guy broke windows in a hotel and shot 500 fucking people. God, if that's not a clear situation where people need to look at it and go, okay, how does this get presented? And it doesn't get presented by burring your head in the sand. It doesn't get offended. It doesn't get prevented by just going back to the second amendment and it just yelling it out, stomping your feet and pound your fist on the table,

Speaker 2:          02:00:06       you know, shall not be infringed. That is not how you prevent your children from getting shot by a fucking psycho. See, I think what's hard in this too is that we don't have any answers. There's no. Well, if it was just mental health or just this or just that because it's a mystery. So people are just grasping at things and everybody standing their ground, they eat the pro gun, the anti gun, and they're saying cc and all the disgusting stuff on twitter. And people did try to curb this a bit. This stuff of people using that as a ramp for their own whatever their views were. And that was pretty ugly. You know, seeing those videos, you always have that right? Will you always have that. But in this, you know, when it's loss of life and it's not just, oh, trump said this dumb thing, you know, that's that just barrage. I saw that video of all the people running, um, you know, that it was, um, there's a, it's like a 10 minute video and the police hurting them. Some people didn't even realize it was gun fire and you hear that, that, that constant barrage when you hear that for that period of time, that gun going off so many times and so many people, um, being just that guy's victim, that was so horrible. That guy's brother getting interviewed. No, I just saw a photograph of the 90 minute interview

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       is one of the most fucking bizarre interviews I've ever seen in my life. He's so removed from his brother doing this and he's talking about what a great guy his brother is and how quirky his brother was, how his, his brother was just. He was eccentric and he was just talking about what his brother would have done in the casino. People all

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       knew his brother and to say they didn't know him was crazy, but this guy seems like a guy trying to act normal. It is so weird. I mean, there might be some sort of a mental health issue with the entire family because the dad apparently was a psycho and was a serial bank robber. I don't know, but it's some of the fucking strangers interview where he's not like horrified. He's not crying. He's not stunned. It's, it's so fucking weird. And it brings me back to the whole mental health aspect of it. You have, there has to be a lot of shit wrong with your mind for you to be able to do something like that. What it is, what it is. I hope we figure it out, but sure do. To Jesus. Amy. I thought it was gonna be a positive interview to be a big old bomber. A crazy girl. What can I say? Fine. This is great. It was fun. I really enjoyed it. Me Too. Um, so for people to want to read your column, it's advice goddess.com.

Speaker 3:          02:02:35       Yeah. Or actually I prefer they read it, look it up and papers and some of them have changed it to the name I prefer, which is science advice. Got Us stuck concert. I feel like this chick who is just pulling out of her butt, and then I have a new book, unfuck ology field guide bucket in a lot of your books. I know. So terrible. This was an accident and it actually sets a unfuck log, a field guide to living with guts and confidence and good manners for Nice people sometimes say, fuck. Thank you, amy. It was a lot of fun talking to you is great. All right folks, we'll be back in a little bit with a Russell brand. See you.

Speaker 6:          02:03:06       Yeah.
