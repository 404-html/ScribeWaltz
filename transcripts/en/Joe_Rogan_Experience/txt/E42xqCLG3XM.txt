Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. So dice is such a maniac. He makes this album when he's selling out Madison Square Garden, he's selling out the Nassau Coliseum. He sell him out Gi and places like, I think to this day it's like Kevin Hart and him. I like the biggest as far as like the most successful John Kevin Hart's done like 60,000 seat places and say, yeah, I mean he's, he's, what's the new word? Philly. It was like 60,000 pounds of trailer for it out. Now what's next? It's a, it's insane. I mean, he's a insane, literally. And I said, I think I told you before his, his phone bill or electric bill at one point was in my name because he was so like, he asked me if I could put it, my name's to, we're going to turn the electricity off. Wow. I can fill it. That's crazy. Holy Shit. Yeah, like nuts where he's at now.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Wow, that's crazy. It's great. My Mom's still has no scope of that at all. Shook. You're out in la. She goes, tell Kev we said, whoa. I'm like, I'm probably going to see him. He's probably in Bulgaria doing a fucking covered by body guards. Yeah, riding on a wave of diamonds, wearing his own sneakers. I had a genuine a bomb out. Like I felt bad about it too and it was before, you know, I was having a rough go. I was headlining a the Sacramento Improv or punchlines second to a punchline, which I love that club and I was headlining it and I felt pretty good about headlining it. I'm like, you know, seven show week or whatever it is, but I'm like, this is great. I'm headlining the punchline. Sacramento. Kevin was in town doing the Arco arena where the Sacramento Kings play and I'm like, all right.

Speaker 1:          01:32          He goes, hey man, come to the hotel and hang out. I go, absolutely. And I go to the hotel where outside for a 30 seconds when I get to the hotel, he's coming out of like the hotel gym. It's like around the corner and I meet him and we're walking to the hotel on this like a hundred foot walk. Car Stopped. People pour out of buildings, people start yelling and screaming. He turns around and gives them one way. If we go into the hotel, we go up to his suite. That is amazing. It's got a whole bunch of his boys there. They're playing a xbox three 60 the time it was and he goes, you went to watch the, um, he was doing or watch the intro for my special, my dad was not this one. It's out now. The one before where he's got the pyrotechnics going off.

Speaker 1:          02:16          He's like, yeah, we got pyro and it's going off. He showed me this crazy like insane trailer for it that's just like mind blowing. And I was feeling so good about, oh, I'm sorry. I should preface this story by saying, um, when I was talking to the cab driver bringing me to calves hotel, he was like, what are you scrolling from a hotel to a hotel for? And I go off, you want to hear the story? It's pretty, I said, Kevin Hart's here and I'm a, he's all buddy of mine sent me to go hang out with them. And he's like, yeah, go. Yeah, I'm in town. I'm a comedian too. I'm playing the punchline and went and he goes, oh, that's amazing man, cause can I get tickets? And I was like, yeah, I could like put you on the list for some tickets if you want to say like what show you want to come to.

Speaker 1:          02:57          There's like two shows and there or something. He goes to shows at the argo arena. And I was like, oh no. He goes, oh I'm sorry man. I thought I want to take it to Kevin Hart show. Oh they guy's like, okay. He asking you for Kevin Hart's tickets. So that's how that starts. That's how this thing starts. And he gives me his card, this cab driver, he goes, call me when you're done cause I'll be right in the area. Okay. I go up. So Kev showing me the pyrotechnics, if it was easy, you went lobster, we're all getting lobsters and shit. I'm not even exaggerating. It's like this kind of hang and I'm like, this is fucking crazy. And, uh, and his buddies are all playing the xbox and I said, try to find some like sign of like old Kevin there, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          03:40          Not, not that he's, he hasn't personalities, not shitty or anything. Just like, you know, connect on some level of what our friendship is. I'm like, you still bring your xbox everywhere highs. I still do that too. I pack it up in a like Schlep it with me everywhere I go so I could do something during the day. And he goes, oh no man, because every time we land we send a guy out to buy an xbox for the day and then we leave it for the maids. And I was like, I gotta go and I left like in a weird short amount of time and the guy picks me up in the cab and we're driving back to my hotel and he's scans me these questions like, how was it man? How was it was fine. I'm like, I wasn't that when like a contest to meet him.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Like I know and he's like, Oh man, he's so funny. It's craig goes by the way, cause I feel like a dick. Um, I'd love to, if to offer stop. I'd love to come to one of your shows this weekend. I go, yeah man, absolutely. Let me know. He's like, my wife would love it man. He goes, I'll bring her out because I look really cool. I'll be like, hey, I know the comedian stuff and I'll be like, yeah man, whatever you want. So I go, it's just stop before we got out of the car, just tell me what show which surely you want to go to. And we pull up to the hotel like, you know, it's kind of a quiet 15 minutes ride and I'm getting ready to go. So hey buddy, what's your name? So I'll put you in for tickets. He goes, honestly man, I'm not going to come.

Speaker 1:          04:59          Why do you keep building me up to hurt my feelings? What the fuck man, I'm going out of his way. Yeah, that was like the saddest. I was headlining the punchline. I was excited. I was, and then all of a sudden I was like, Jesus, man, I I the call, like I've made phone calls back home like why am I so like just fucking awfully green with envy. I just showed it all over my ass in that room. It's tough. Well, first of all, that cab driver wasn't helping anything that kind of put you in a weird state of mind. He was an idiot. So you went, you went to Kevin's place, you were driven her out by an idiot and you're going to see the most successful comedian of all time. Yeah. Who is your friend who you helped with? His electrical bill and you get in there and they're throwing away xbox just to meet lobsters.

Speaker 1:          05:41          I got assume you're a high as fuck, right? Will you hide when you went over there? I maybe had to be there. Those guys aren't really doing anything like that. But you probably did before you went over there for sure. Right? I know I would. Yeah. That scared the fuck out of me. I'd be like, ah, it's too rich. I got to get away from him. Sorry. I said a meltdown, I'm like, hey, they go, well, you know, [inaudible] I don't understand how a guy like that can work as much as he does. Um, being meaning, I don't know. Not that I don't understand that he's at ambitious. I don't understand where the time comes from. I mean, it's several movies I think still coming out. Well, it's a, it's also stand up and it's also, I mean, he's just on top of it. Social media is, social media is like a business to him. Yeah. It's a really interesting guy, man. Like super, super ambitious. Well, the new, uh, the new trailer for the, for the new special says he goes, uh, comedy's first ever. Mogul and gas sort of. I guess so. I mean, for sure. Well, whatever, who gives a fuck about first ever this or that he's about to say, but as a mom, what other comedian was a mogul you think was a real, like Jerry Seinfeld running a business? The branch. I mean, Kevin's got sneakers. Does he? He's cool. I didn't know Scott. Nike sneakers. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:04          Okay.
