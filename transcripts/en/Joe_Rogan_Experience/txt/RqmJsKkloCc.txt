If you haven't been there in a while or if you never been there before on it is a human optimisation Web site. What we sell is the best shit that we can find as far as strength and conditioning equipment. As far as nutrients as far as protein powder and supplements of course we have the primal kettle bells that the ape kettle bells and the zombie kettle bells which are new ones that we have made. Why. Because why not. You supposed to be inspired when you working out no better way to be inspired than to stare at a big fucking 70 pound gorilla head.

Speaker 2:          00:02:52       It's frightening. It's exciting and it's good for you if you want strength in conditioning equipment. If you want to get fit and strong and you want what they call functional strength there's no better way than than kettle bells. I'm a huge fan and supporter of them I work out with them every week and you should to use skinny fuck get on it. Oh and I t use a code word Rogan say. Rogan was on Rogan wrote me yeah. You know are OJ and save 10 percent off any and all supplements. And what is your new Web site do you guys have while we're on this. What is that.

Speaker 3:          00:03:26       People can download media to episodes meat eater dot VH X dot tv so all these people have been saying Dude how do I get these meat eater episodes man. I can't find them online unless you've gone the bit torrent route which is rude. Don't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       Now you can go to meat eater dot VH X dot tv it's a site that allows you to finally sell volumes they can sell volumes of the meat eater episodes online and in HD as well. And if you use the code word Rogan you can get a five dollar discount on any of the volumes. And the one that we were on is season four volume 4 is the bundle that has the one with Brian Callanan that's got both of them. Yes. Oh good. So according to Helen Cho's e-mail I assume she knows. So that's it right there.

Speaker 4:          00:04:19       I'm so glad I didn't get those now like that. I know it's Friday and we get a lot people asking about that.

Speaker 5:          00:04:23       We'll finally meat eater dot VH X dot tv. That's it. Do you have. I'm sure you have a link on meat eater dot com too right. I'm guessing meat eater is immediately become more meat eater TV. The meat eater dot com meat eater sounds like it could be. Well some guys sitting on it. Oh well it's you and a gay porn couple vying for fitting it up. All right. So go there meat eater dot VH X dot com and go to the meat eater dot com. Steven now is here. Let's not fuck around any further. Cue the music. Young Jamie.

Speaker 6:          00:05:00       The Joe Rogan Experience. To. Get.

Speaker 7:          00:05:09       Some pigs are gonna die this weekend Steve. No that's right. I'm I'm 90 shots in my shoulders made out of fucking hamburger right now from all the impacts unless someone think we're talking about police with time bomb suits scruff.

Speaker 8:          00:05:23       Yeah I thought about posting a photo of the targets that I shot and some pigs are going to die but I didn't think that that would be. No that could be problematic. Sue Sue. I'm glad you're here.

Speaker 9:          00:05:35       This the the Eurasian wild boar. You know it's interesting man all.

Speaker 10:         00:05:43       All pigs in North America so domestic the kind you and your bacon feral ones wild ones it's all one species. Yeah you told me that much is there's differences. They react. They recognize them all as one species. There's some old world like there in Africa there's some other members of the pig family and have a leaner and not have leaner Pachauri so like many here have. People talk about pigs in Arizona they're often talking about a pack. But yeah all the pigs so Charlotte models the spider Wilbur from Wilbur to hog Zilla is soooo scruffy.

Speaker 11:         00:06:18       That's so strange. I didn't know that until you told me when we're in Wisconsin.

Speaker 12:         00:06:23       It doesn't seem right but there's always varieties you know it's like what.

Speaker 10:         00:06:27       You know that but all that they roll all the dogs under Romney. You think that pigs look. You think that Wilbur Ariel like you know like a like a classic though they don't really exist. The is like pink hairless farm pig. I mean he doesn't look as different from what we'd call a Russian boar which is a variety. He doesn't look as different as a Chihuahua does from a mastiff.

Speaker 13:         00:06:46       Yeah but they would discuss those as being what Qantas domestic Qantas domestic what is of the common dog.

Speaker 14:         00:06:55       What's weird about the common dog is that they all emanate from wolves. All of them now. That's so strange. That's while you take a wolf and turn into an English bulldog like How the fuck did that.

Speaker 4:          00:07:07       But I don't know those boys and you you might read this. Those boys in Russia that were taken silver foxes and just like selecting for behavior and stuff they could move those things so fast. Really. Move. Move the trait to me. Yeah. They're just. Yeah. I came home the details and if I did tie the details you'd look it up and then call me in time world's wrong.

Speaker 8:          00:07:29       But somehow I don't I learned not to get too detailed.

Speaker 4:          00:07:32       But they could move dogs really fast. Selecting four color behavioral characteristics was amazing. Just a few generations you know. Wow. They're very malleable.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       I've always wondered how. I mean I think it's a massive mystery isn't it how dogs were initially created of wolves.

Speaker 4:          00:07:51       I mean you hear so many so much contradictory stuff. I got a point in time I guess I've always kind of followed this a little bit and I've written about I learned a lot about dogs. I mentioned this to other. I wrote a piece about eating dogs in Vietnam and so I had this kind of little summation in this article about the history of dogs and it went through the fact checking process at outside magazine which is very rigorous like if you say my mom is my mom they'll call your mom. And make sure it's your mom in I had all these things that I kind of like assumed were just true you know and this fact checkers like that's in fact not true. So I had to relearn my understanding of dogs at the time they were saying oh you know it seems that dogs originated in China and you know like the oldest trace of dogs is there.

Speaker 10:         00:08:38       Since then I feel like I've read that you know they definitely the first Americans deftly brought we're traveling with dogs brought them down in the New World. But here there seems to have been some intro aggression from the Grey Wolf. So they picked up some other characteristics move things along the way even though the guys that came through the Bering Land Bridge were not pack and with them a dog that looked Wolf like their prey pack and with them a dog it was decidedly domestic dog like wow. So they had already gone already gone through some you know who had already gone through some transformations they were just traveling Wolf dogs they were traveling with a dog that had been under selective pressure for you know fifteen years.

Speaker 9:          00:09:19       I mean because I remember one time saying all the domestic dogs seems to go back 30000 years the domestic dogs need to go back thousand years but people arrived here you know is debated but some time between maybe 15 20 thousand years ago and when they showed up they had a dog that was not a wolf. But but then there was intra aggression from wolves. But this seems to be like a really hot topic and people are always digging into this because genetics is changing everything we understand like things that we used to think were related are not related things we think we're not related are in fact related. You know we talk that I like the whole media thing like that. MUELLER seemed to be a very new species. You know since the Pleistocene really. Yeah. It is not. They have been around long. It was like a hybridization event between black tailed deer and white tailed do you created the media.

Speaker 15:         00:10:07       It's like our newest big game species and it's probably will be one that doesn't last long. You know it'll be like in the long term you might look at mule deer and see them as this this blip really just like. I mean they're so susceptible to being out competed the very habitat fragmentation is hard on them and they have been here long. I mean other hand whitetail deer been here millions of years. They're like they thrive. They're super adaptable they can eat anything live anywhere.

Speaker 10:         00:10:33       They're amazingly capable of surviving on this continent and mule deer like this new thing. It's a bar like my favorite animal. I like the sun. You know the sun's going to last for a billion more years it's going to burn out.

Speaker 8:          00:10:47       But I think I like this.

Speaker 9:          00:10:49       I like them you'll hear a lot to this and it seems like I mean despite a lot of people's best efforts to prevent it from happening it seems like Mehldau are vulnerable.

Speaker 2:          00:10:57       It seems like they're slowly starting to die off too. There was an article about the numbers dropping in their habitat dropping and being diminished.

Speaker 16:         00:11:04       They're being pushed down then. Some things are hard to explain you know. But white tails they've always lived in the southeast and white tails seem to periodically expand out again for climatic reasons retract but they kind of keep that like ancestral homeland. I'm talking very long term ancestral homeland the southeast but once I'm white cells made it all across the country and some climatic conditions or something happen in the population retracted but it left this remnant population in California on the car on the Pacific coast and then there was a massive genetic barrier. You know like if you took a bunch of dogs and separate them and put you know some dogs in South America and some dogs North American came back and checked on them in a long time they're going to have gone in a little different direction and that became the black tail. And then at the time the black tail seems to have extended its range eastward. The white tailed deer extended its range back westward and there was a hybridization event where male black tails were breeding with female white tails and producing like this hybrid mule deer there's a habitat retraction again in black tails retracted back to the coast and white tails retract back the other way and you had this that spawned this thing we call me older how do they follow that.

Speaker 9:          00:12:21       Like how do they know there was all this guy various guys who's like the most interesting biologist he's a guy out of Calgary and various guys has kind of like done so much work on big game. He's got like the mule. He's like people like oh he's the military guy. He's dealt guys the buffalo guy. He came up a lot of interesting theories like solving some stuff we talked about the past where various guys came up with the idea that what happens is species when they colonize land had been vacated by glaciers.

Speaker 16:         00:12:47       You know there's certain things that go on and you got into founder effect you know where imagine like one way we got different as people is imagine that just like for people struck off across the oceans in a homemade craft and landed there and you had a male and a female in a spawn a new you know they successfully breeding cranium population. Let's say they both just happened to be six seven You know in three hundred pounds you had like this thing like the founder effect where a small little population can carry traits and characteristics that are maybe not totally not a complete example of where they came from and so you have like a radical deviation when they spread out.

Speaker 15:         00:13:37       Wow. So he got into this stuff with animals and in water animals seemed to change like when the bison arrived in North America. Why did it also have a 6 foot horn span and then shrank very rapidly. So he got into a lot of these ideas and he also did a lot of genetic work you know like mitochondrial DNA.

Speaker 4:          00:13:55       So they can track female descent you should have in mind sometime. Yeah. You know he'd be the coolest guy to have on the world actually various guys. Yeah. Where do you live. Could I come listen. Yeah. Just listen at home with most people right. We could just come in you come in. I'm sure you'd have questions yeah. You could just sit there and drink coffee. OK. And I'll come and I'll be like. Sounds perfect. I no explain this to me Mr. Guy is that he's a great guy. So he was he got in a lot of stuff with the deer and I bring all this up because we're looking at your fine specimen you're fine four by four mules sitting here and would've never happened if it wasn't for you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:32       Boom boom. I was watching this thing there was talking about deer on television they were talking about the difference in the size of the bodies of deer from the far north like Alberta in Canada to the far south. Like in Mexico. And the further you go south. The animals tend to be smaller they tend to be smaller bodied.

Speaker 9:          00:14:51       Yeah it's the prints maybe got Mickey. It's the print. Alan Burt is the burger principle. It's got a name tag there's a name for that principle and it would be that if you'd like to take the extreme like white tail like the biggest guys dream of going to Alberta to hunt white tails because White tells a huge meal out 100 pounds right there a nugget big know that's crazy that's an elk.

Speaker 15:         00:15:13       I mean 400 is huge but you know you get deer it pushed up and you go down the Florida Keys. That's a white tail. Those things are 70 80 pounds. So there's this principle the burger Bergman It's got a name my brother he told me the name what is and what some species seem to be a little bit exempt. They say that mule you don't do that quite as much you know you get some really big meal and other areas they're not they're not as tied to but just like a general principle what do they speculate has to do with is heat retention.

Speaker 9:          00:15:43       So you have more like you weigh more than me I have more surface area per unit of mass than you have so if you're really big deer if you're in the north the thing you're trying to do is retain body heat in the animals like people shed body heat by just exposing parts like when deer lay down they lay down with their legs talk to them because look on the inside of deer's leg. Very thin hair very thin hair under the tail. Right now we're laying down to protect. If it's cold they're protecting those areas that have thin hair. So a big animal has less surface area. So he's he's less capable of shedding heat and more capable of retaining heat. A small wiry animal has greater service there. He's able to shed heat. So one of the things you look at Mueller like Mehldau further south will have tend to have bigger ears because a very a great way to shed heat is through your ears will have thinner hair on their ears bigger years if you think what a radical version of it is imagine like the woolly mammoth. OK Roy Mann with the woolly mammoth is more closely related to the African elephant than he is to the mastodon. So you had North America at the tail end of the Pleistocene he had mammoths and mastodons and mammoths were not very close related to mastodons. They're pretty close were they to African elephants mammoths live in the north. They have essentially no ear. They have a very small here. You look at African elephants had those giant friggin ears because they can funnel a lot of blood through those ears and shed a lot of heat.

Speaker 15:         00:17:23       It's like you shed a lot of heat through your fingers you know in your ears how they get so cold so fast because you're able to you know you push a lot of blood into those areas and it's cooling off in the air. So that's one reason that that's like a theory of if it is. I think it might be the Bergman principle Bergman's Bergman's rule that's where Bergman's rule would has one explanation for it. I don't know if you'd ever really know the absolute truth an explanation for its heat retention heat dissipation. That's fascinating so the stuff that's on the northern extreme of its range where it's boarding up against like the thing that that puts the throttle on its existence is cold. He will tend to get bigger in mammals.

Speaker 9:          00:18:02       You know he'll tend to get bigger but then there's all these other deviations like why do you know how you get these huge reptiles on islands you know. Yeah. And then on islands you tend to have dwarfing like that Rangel island off Siberia had these little mini mammoths you know. Yeah. So there's all these other factors like I don't you know I don't know why it's like that with islands but not with latitude. Do you get that. And I've also I think I've read from maybe as various guys was writing about how Mehldau seemed to not be quite as they seem to defy Bergman's rule a little bit more than some other species do prob because they're a hybrid.

Speaker 17:         00:18:37       I've no idea. That's fascinating. The island dwarfism is a weird thing. It's bizarre how it doesn't apply to lizards.

Speaker 4:          00:18:43       Yeah they get you know like yeah I guess those things get huge and these get small you'll know nothing about weird thing about Mueller and it just kind of fits here in California like you know I've obviously I five.

Speaker 9:          00:18:52       So for black tailed you are very very similar to Mueller Columbia blacks also in California have Colombia Black Tail Washington Oregon you have colony black to eventually get up to the north of just north on the coast you get to the B.C. Alaska border these are calling them six black tail sick of black tails man you look at them like they almost looked like a white tail but they're a black tailed deer the Columbia Black Tail resembles much more Amelia for record keeping purposes the divided between the range of the Colombia mule deer I'm sorry the divide between the range the Colombian black tail and the Mehldau is I 5 really. So if that's some jumps the road he is for for record keeping purposes he because he he goes from being a Columbia black tail to a mule deer so you look like the all the record book Columbia black tails you know are shot along the the the left side of I five on a northward direction because they're just like so you know they're much bigger than anywhere else but they gotta divide it somewhere it's divide divided like that.

Speaker 9:          00:19:54       So when one thing's life he could jump back and forth. They're not even recognizes as distinct if you look at the Latin name for him you know the scientific name for him there like taxonomy is don't recognize the difference but we all do it like you look at I mean like that's not a I mean older man I can tell by looking but it's just these morphological differences these things you see but they're not really betrayed in them you know in the genetics that's fascinating man that's it's so interesting trying to track the history of these animals and somebody actually did that and figured out yeah and it changes all time yeah they use it like this one is like my old man he used to reject so much this stuff because it would change but while you say this so no made it look well they were saying the best understanding and now this is the you know it's not static subject to change but it's frustrating for people.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       I'm glad you're on this week because this is a week that's pretty controversial in the news. This story about this black rhino that they auctioned off a hunt for this is some fascinating shit to me because fill me in. Do you know the story.

Speaker 18:         00:21:02       I only know I know no more than what you said. I've been I've been at the thing oh all week. Oh you are the shot show. Yes. I haven't even. There is a.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       They they auctioned off a hunt for a black rhino in the winter. Paid three hundred fifty thousand dollars to shoot this rhino. There's only like X amount of thousand of them left in the world and people are going fucking bananas can I guess that they're using that three hundred fifty thousand dollars to put up enforcement. Yes they can. For conservation they generated over a million dollars in the auction. Really. Allegedly. Yeah. And what. What they're saying is that this rhino had to go anyway because this rhino was an old non breeder and he was very aggressive and he was trying to kill the younger males. And because it's an extinct or because it's an endangered species. This was an animal that they were going to have to do something about anyway. And really. Yeah. They would have either had to I guess put him in animal prison or they're going to have to fucking shoot him. So they decided to auction off. They have this very specific animal that they've targeted this old non breeding male. And the guy who auction who won the auction is now in fear of his life.

Speaker 11:         00:22:14       I mean the really the press is has he gone and done it. No not yet. He lives in Dallas or just outside of Dallas and he don't know if I was going to pick what town he lived in. I was going to ask you about that too because Texas is a fucking strange place man. You know it's way different wildlife model. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       Since being introduced to hunting by you I've become pretty obsessed and I read about it all the time and I'm trying to sort out all the different philosophies and try to figure out why people think what they think.

Speaker 19:         00:22:45       But what I'm most fascinated by in Texas is these wild game farms. Is a really weird thing they do where they'll they I saw some online that were like fucking 70 acres and they have a high fence and people pretending that they're hunting in these things.

Speaker 4:          00:23:03       Yeah they'll sometimes set the animal out on the day. It's it's crazy. I mean it's but it's something. But let's come back round it. I want to talk for me about the I the the rhino thing. There are versions of that here and we can talk about.

Speaker 9:          00:23:21       I can talk in a much more educated where you're much more knowledgeable fashioned about versions of that that occur here in the U.S. but like I've never been to Africa I haven't hunted in Africa I have ill like ill informed opinions about what goes on in Africa but I recognize when it comes to stuff like this it's there are so many contradictions that are hard to deal with. And it's really difficult. People get their heads wrapped around why a guy you know I don't know. Not knowing the person. I can't say that the person is saying who's like oh I would just as happily give you the money to help save rhinos but if this one has to go anyways I suppose I'll come and get it.

Speaker 14:         00:24:02       You know I don't really know what his motivations are his motivations are not that he he's a part of a big game trophy hunting group.

Speaker 4:          00:24:09       Yeah. He's never gonna be he's not gonna build bring it back into the U.S. probably.

Speaker 14:         00:24:13       I don't know. I don't know. I mean I know what he was trying to do. I don't know he's planning to do. I don't know but I know I've been reading all these articles of the interview. The guy he's afraid of his life. I mean they're talking about skinning his children alive. Is that right. Oh it's fucking you know animal rights people get pretty crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       Can I tell you about it can I tell you about a parallel like a parallel thing that goes on the U.S. It's like I just can't speak to it they're like I don't even know who is owned the rhino. I mean is an honor. Is it like Sonic conservation. It's not a concession.

Speaker 2:          00:24:43       Well what they're doing is they have like you know X amount of thousands of them and they need money in order to maintain the pride. Who is they force it. That's a good question. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:24:53       Yeah let me talk about a parallel thing that happens in the U.S. if you're interested. Yes. Get in the US we have we abide by the basic notion. This is generally true in the US that wildlife longs to people.

Speaker 20:         00:25:08       So if you have us take an imaginary elk in this imaginary elk is on the also National Park and one day the elk jumps the fence and lands on national forest and Montana jumps on a fence and his own state forest in Montana and he jumps another fence and he's on a big ranch in Montana.

Speaker 9:          00:25:30       Throughout that animal's day he has always been U.S. he's always belong to the people. When he's in Montana he's belong to like the state of Montana is in charge for his management. So we have this idea in a rough sense we have this idea that we maintain here that the wildlife is held in the public trust an individual can control access to his lands for hunting but the animal belongs to state. You don't get to make decisions necessarily about the things that are on your property. And that's been something that like the Americans and particularly the American hundreds of AHS been proud of. We had this like North American model of wildlife conservation we always talked about which is this idea of public trust wildlife and that we manage it in long term things because people have a vested interest in having more and more animals around for whatever purpose viewing hunting et cetera.

Speaker 9:          00:26:23       One of the things they do though and so you take an animal like like the bighorn sheep in the bighorn sheep at a time was pretty nearly wiped out. I mean they were hurt. They were never hurt and as bad as black rhinos but they were hurt and really bad. And as we got them restored we started having limited numbers of tags. May have a mountain range and every year they determine that we can kill one sheep out of that range and people will do this every year. People will apply for a lottery that's conducted by the state and you put your name in the hat. You pay a fee they you know put all the names they're drawing out be like Dave draws a tag and this generates a whole bunch more and they use it for tranquilizing sheep that you can helicopter in the new areas and restore the species and all the funding comes to this kind of stuff.

Speaker 9:          00:27:07       One thing they realize a great way to make money is if you can get that up blessing you can kill five out of that mountain range they might want it gone. We're going to you know we'll do four through the lottery which is for everyone like the common man's pool but we're going take one and auctioned off every year the one the bighorn sheep take they auctioned in Montana. It goes for two hundred three hundred four hundred thousand dollars. Every year I mean I think reasoning went for 380 or 4. I mean it is always up there. I don't I don't think. I don't think it's broken a half million but it goes up because if you go out in Montana and you go hunt six if you go on the Missouri Breaks all the record book Big Horns come out of there. OK. Like the biggest big horns the biggest Rocky Mountain big horns come out of the break.

Speaker 9:          00:27:50       So guys will pay a ton for the gut what they call the governors tag in Montana. And it raises a ton of money and it does a ton of good but some people feel I see both sides this argument. Some people feel like that bit of money is not worth the damage you're doing by upsetting this idea of democratically own and ministered wildlife like most guys will put in their entire life or a big ownership tag you know pay the fee every year and they have no chance. I've been putting in for that tag for 14 years I've accumulated. They started a bonus points system 12 years ago and a bonus point system is that every year you put it in the next year you get a you get up every year you put him without being successful you get a point in a square year points so next year my name will go in the hat one hundred and forty four times.

Speaker 9:          00:28:40       If you did it for your first year your name will go on that one time. Even with my name in the hat one hundred forty four times I don't think I'm even up to having a 1 percent chance of drawing a big horn sheep tag. So meanwhile guy come in and he makes much money. One guy that buys lately made a lot of money selling sandwiches. He comes in and he's like me buying one of those and I'll buy it next year. And people like all that money is so useful and it is. People are like Dude this is not the country we live in because we're still we're still kind of hurting from the idea of where we came from in Europe which is like the Robin Hood model.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       You gotta be rich to hunt a lot of people don't know that the Robin Hood was actually based on hunting. Yeah. It wasn't based on stealing money from the rich and giving to the poor. It's based on the poor weren't allowed to hunt.

Speaker 10:         00:29:28       Yeah. He would go out and hunt the Kings animals and he used it. I mean at the even at the time when our ancestors were like first coming over you they could kill you for hunting they kill you for hunting and then you had to be rich to hunt. So when guys like you think I like the story of Daniel Boone man he came out and he's like Jesus whole you know his relatives came from England. He comes over here is like man this whole freaking country. I go hunt wherever I want. So people really fell in love with that idea of freedom and you know and that you kind of roam around and the animals were there free for the taking. And now we're a little bit upsetting this model but all the people who were on the other side of this say the but the money so helpful. And it wasn't for big chunks of money like that we wouldn't have recovered the bighorn sheep as effectively as we've recovered the bighorn sheep and it's not cheap you know three or four hundred thousand dollars for a tag is incredible.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       Type in Montana governor's tab you'll see what it went for last time. Do they sometimes fail. I mean they must must. I heard a story where the guys that the guys that buy it once you spend that kind of money you want to rule out uncertain and you know that you can picture the area right. Yeah. You know all this stuff he floated through and we saw when a guy I'll buy what I want a guy held by the governor's tab. He'll usually hire some guides or he'll hire some guys to go spend a couple of months they'll put together a dossier on the animals that are in the area. Yeah man. Oh my God. That's ridiculous. A scout and when they find one they stay on. These guys just specialize in this business.

Speaker 19:         00:30:53       Look at that four hundred and eighty thousand dollar bid. The record for 2013. Oh my God. Four hundred and eighty thousand dollars somebody paid for the tag. Look at those dudes going to war.

Speaker 8:          00:31:05       Yeah sack is kind of tucked up to the left he can't really appreciate it. Yeah. We we showed that video the other day of you talking about wanting to eat it. So it's valuable to people. It's a ton of money. Not the sack.

Speaker 4:          00:31:19       No no not Zach. No but it really makes people mad. Yes. There is a story. And how do you know it's true. I heard it from enough people I tend to think it's true. So these guys go out and they'll get a guy they'll get guys out there. They find a tanker you know they want to ram it scored. This got over 200 inches of horn or more. And they file and they don't let it out of their eyes. Right. They stand up stand down and eventually the guy comes out and they go. There he is that's the one you want a few. There's a rumor a few years ago this guy had done this need spent all this money. I think I heard. I'm just telling you unsubstantiated stuff I'm nothing Tony. I'm not telling you what year or is names I don't because I want to say that and be wrong about what a high roller buys this thing pays a figure rumored to be around 30 grand to have some guy fired. Check this out it comes down to it and guys like third one from the front third one from the front. They go down and the goalie get mixed round and she was in it goes or is wrong one. Bam.

Speaker 14:         00:32:16       Rumor has it that that he that this gentleman later bought another one went out and bought another went out and got a big fatty so he might have spent five hundred six hundred grand.

Speaker 4:          00:32:28       I and man I see it like it tears me up because like everything in life it's so complicated. I see both sides of it. Like I love our system. I love the idea that wildlife is public trust.

Speaker 9:          00:32:39       And I think that the like there's no other way to explain the success of of the richness of animals and the riches of rulers habitats we have in this country when you look at how many people live here how wealthy we are what we call the technology. Like so many other countries that would be sitting where we're at. Have destroyed their wildlife you know but we have a very in place like a very intact system. And we've done a fantastic job and I think that one of the ways you explain the fantastic job we've done is that we really held true to this idea that wildlife belongs to us. And when you do damage to it you're doing damage to this idea of you know an American treasure you're damaging other people's interests. So yeah man it's complicated. So that's my long way of answering. The rhino thing. I'm.

Speaker 16:         00:33:31       I bet you anything it is extremely complex complicated and there is emotion battling logic.

Speaker 2:          00:33:40       I'm amazed that it's cheaper to kill a fucking rhino than it is a big horned sheep that is mine.

Speaker 11:         00:33:45       It is amazing doesn't buy me 100 grand plus. That's crazy.

Speaker 16:         00:33:51       That's amazing. What's the ivory worth. Not worth that.

Speaker 3:          00:33:55       I don't think they have ivory. They have horns. Their horn is made at a hair.

Speaker 4:          00:33:58       A rhino has no black rhinos got. No. Oh rhino horn is not ivory but it's very valuable. Yeah it's not ivory.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       No no it's it's valuable because they're idiots because people think that it makes your dick hard. And like I guess they haven't heard about Vi Agger wherever the fuck they're trying out rhino horn.

Speaker 10:         00:34:14       But I went to I went there did I mean just like three days ago I saw the act the current head of the U.S. I went to see the current head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service speak about some issues that we'll be facing this year in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is getting really involved in the rhino trade and we talk about all the money they're spending you know spending money and enforcement you're spending money on trying to battle the sauce like that you might somehow convince people that they don't want it.

Speaker 4:          00:34:39       You know all the things you would do. I mean really think about the millions and millions of dollars of Tarmoh thrown around a member being like to bet you can't go find any guy who wants to go get one. You'd give him more money than he's ever gonna make hunting them. Yeah but doesn't the world doesn't work that way because some other day would be like but nobody like you would make every rhino poacher really wealthy.

Speaker 18:         00:34:59       Yeah and they just be like Okay cool I'll quit. But it wouldn't work. And other people come along to be a rhino poacher too. No I know but I've never heard a thing of those guys could only know the amount.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       Because you know they're not like no matter what like that business I don't like moat the guys that are actually out there with firearms you can imagine the guy that's out on the ground hunting rhinos being chased by people who have pretty much a license to in some cases kill them. Like I don't think that guy is a rich man. He's he's making someone wealthy but there's no way that that guy is rich.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       And not only that it's just such a bizarre thing. The idea of shooting this giant majestic endangered animal just for its horn and they're not eating them they're not doing anything else with them. They're just shooting them and taking their horns. And there's no real medicinal value. It's not like the rhino would be one thing. The rhino horn had this incredible anti aging property and it turned you into a young person again. Well you know they'd probably fucking kill every Rhino they could find.

Speaker 4:          00:35:57       But it doesn't do anything it doesn't really do anything but think about what it's just but it's it's probably I mean it's it's an issue of poverty. Yeah and of that justifies mom saying like I don't even know the guys that are out poaching rhinos. They might not even have any idea who it is that they might have like some vague awareness about the properties but all of they believe in the properties as well.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       Yeah I'm a little bit ignorant about who's actually wanting these rhino horns what I've heard it's an Asian thing. But it seems to be one of the most bizarre misunderstandings and miscommunications ever in this day and age with all the information that's available especially because it's always about penises.

Speaker 8:          00:36:36       It's always about guys. Well it's a foul. Getting a red it isn't foul Yeah yeah. It's gonna be just that it's a nice phallus. Mm hmm. But they did grind it up for medicine man only.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       It's so strange. I mean it's an amazing animal when you look at a rhino it to me I mean it's one of the closest things when you look like a triceratops or a stegosaurus or something like that and you look at a rhino it's like one of the closest things to that ancient time you look at this big fucking giant armored animal.

Speaker 3:          00:37:06       It's a strange strange animal you know and the idea that people are killing it to make their dick hard is just so bizarre and and.

Speaker 13:         00:37:15       But no they're killing it to make money.

Speaker 17:         00:37:19       Yeah people are buying it together to make the big art. Yeah. And it's not even working. You know it's just so strange.

Speaker 10:         00:37:25       We shouldn't have. We should make a public service announcement right now we'll have dropped leaflets over China just it doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          00:37:32       His bags full of aggro drop them with parachutes just just launch them you know.

Speaker 12:         00:37:38       Yeah. Isn't it amazing like in that way that this stuff now I'd be like no do this really does work. I mean like you to the point where it could cause trouble for you try.

Speaker 8:          00:37:47       Well we have to go to a doctor because your dick won't go down. It works on everybody too. Works on dying people chew up a biography of a zombie dick and your parents scratching at your zipper those veins and you think that there would be no.

Speaker 13:         00:38:00       Do you think that the pharmaceutical industry would would not the pharma that what's what's the word the effort like the aphrodisiac.

Speaker 5:          00:38:08       Yeah. Guess what.

Speaker 4:          00:38:10       What is the term. No I'm saying what is the term for like something that you look you want Asian whore or are you wanting for these all right. Yeah. Did the aphrodisiac market for men would you know these Dick hardening market for men would evaporate. Well now that there are pharmaceuticals there specifically tailored for that and are clinically proven to work.

Speaker 2:          00:38:33       Well that's how you know that's how the American troops get information about the Taliban from the Afghani warlords is vagaries and no one method of payment really. Yeah because these guys a lot of these warlords you know though they're live in like the same way they lived back when Alexander the Great was running Afghanistan. Afghanistan has Kabul and then mountains and mountains filled with villages and extremely primitive locations and you know that they're live in old school and sometimes as a guy who's a warlord who's got 20 wives and his dick doesn't work anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       And you know they come along and they go look we've got guns it's like I got guns and we got women I've got 20 wives and I can even fuck them. Oh listen check this out. Give him a bottle of pills and guys like listen these Taliban Fox I never liked them.

Speaker 8:          00:39:20       They're hiding over there. Those guys are over there. How many more pills you got to give these guys cases cases of Niagara. They tell them everything. They can't stop talking. Yeah I've heard a big mac diplomacy. That's the way via diplomacy. That that that actually works.

Speaker 10:         00:39:35       I'm 40 years old month.

Speaker 8:          00:39:37       You ready to get it on the vagaries that we try to tell me.

Speaker 17:         00:39:39       No I'm saying it's back to this. This rhino thing you're talking about.

Speaker 4:          00:39:49       Yeah. I just can't I can't. I just my head wants to blow up because I just I see all sides of it. I do. But that's beautiful. I think that's important the part I don't see the part I do not see though for me is I don't like I would never like I don't have that desire to hunt one of those. But so much of that kind thing is in his heart.

Speaker 10:         00:40:10       People that don't understand so much that kind of stuff comes from context you know well you develop over time a deep context with an animal and for me that familiarity in the hours you spend the hours you log watching it understanding it reading about it starting it for me develops into something like produce is a great desire to hunt the animal. Once I get to know it an animal that I don't know well I don't have any desire. I don't have that much desire to hunt for it but when I watch him and watch him and watch him like like bighorn sheep when I'm when I moved to Montana when I was born Amish when I moved to Montana I didn't go out there being like Man I cannot wait. I'm bighorn sheep. But after spending years and years and years out you know glassing for deer glassing for elk glassing for bears and like Big Horn Big Horn Big Horn.

Speaker 10:         00:40:57       And I really got through. I love to watch big horns. I liked everything about big horns and in time all that man would someday love to have an opportunity to go a big horn. And it was born from that. So when I say that I have no desire to hunt Ryan I'll be like it's just like it would be to me like like honing margins like I just don't have any you know familiarity with it. It just doesn't like culturally. I haven't read about it my whole life I haven't. Like when I go and look at calendars like hunters love wildlife counters and it's like all the stuff we like to hunt you know you don't grow up looking at like the Ryan O page on a one on a hunting calendar. It's just I just have no context with it. And this gentleman that that bought this thing I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything about him. I'd love to talk to him. He doesn't want to come on your podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       Yeah. I don't think he wants to but he's he's. His name is Corey Knowlton and he's got a private security detail following around all the time now. He's giving this interview for this interview with CNN and he's talking about the people of threatened his kids because he has people threatening to kill him right now that I have to talk to the FBI have my private security keep my children from being skinned alive and shot at a little hyperbole a lot of people are just talking shit. I'm not going to kill your fucking kids man. They're not murderers but people get angry when they hear about someone hunting something as a trophy and absolute. I think that there's a big distinction between you wanting to hunt a big horn sheep because you you follow it and you study it and because. But you eat the fucking sheep. Yeah that's that's a difference man. There's something creepy about wanting to shoot something just so you could stuff it and put it in your room Yeah it's complicated it's complicated it's complicated it is that that is like it would feel very if I did shoot the rhino I would eat them.

Speaker 8:          00:42:51       There's no way I wouldn't eat them. Are they edible. They must be. Oh yeah. Lead elephants.

Speaker 4:          00:42:55       I know that you shoot an elephant in the village as friends of mine that have hunted and friends of mine that hunting in Alaska. Sorry friend by the hunted in Africa.

Speaker 20:         00:43:06       Kind of marvel at the rapidity with which like. Like how or how quickly the animals get hauled off and consume as it is like not a lot of waste.

Speaker 10:         00:43:16       You know there are some animals that you look at and you think they'd be really good they're not very popular and other animals. You'd look at and you wouldn't think would be that great and the really popular table fare. I don't know what the reputation of rhino is but elephants are popular.

Speaker 17:         00:43:28       People like the elephant. My problem with Alice my understanding they're intelligent that bothers me. Yeah yeah. Intelligent animals. It bothers me. I have no desire to hunt one. But again I have no context. No I don't and I don't really understand for me to go.

Speaker 9:          00:43:44       Like for me to go Huntsman also have to know that it's sound that it isn't as safe. Position and one nice thing about live in the U.S. I mean there's some exceptions to this but generally in the US like if you want to be if you want to be ethical about your hunting practices in the U.S. you can generally look to the guidance of your state Fish and Game agency.

Speaker 21:         00:44:04       I mean the state Fish and Game agency get away with.

Speaker 9:          00:44:09       I mean theoretically can't get away with and practically can't get away with running a species into the ground. You know it would be big trouble for them. So generally if you if you're looking in and you realize that there's a you know there's a population of big horns and there's some and there is a hunting season form right now it's it's OK. I mean it really is OK if there's if they're finding a decline in that thing they're going to curb it or cut it out altogether and wait till it's growing again. And then you can also look at their long term goal of you know where they want animals. How many animals I think the area can support. So it's easy in the U.S. cause this stuff is watch so much. Obviously again coming from guy to spending time in Africa I know that in Africa like money talks in a way that it doesn't necessarily hear when it comes to small issues like like wildlife. You can buy your way into things that maybe you don't have any real ethical business doing you know in the U.S. is just easier to kind of. There's a lot more information at our fingertips so for me when I when I go hunting I can really kind of read up and understand a lot about what I'm going after where it's at. What the management goals are what risk the animal has is hunting it you know productive and helpful right now as it is potentially detrimental to the species. And you can make your decisions.

Speaker 2:          00:45:22       It is amazing how good a job the Department of Fish and Game or what is the actual group what are they called.

Speaker 9:          00:45:28       Well there's the state so you have U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which is that which is a federal thing and so they have a hand in they have a hand in managing migratory waterfowl but most things are managed by. So every state has a you know you kind of like just in general terms you calm fish and game but it's like in Michigan it's the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in Montana's Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks. But just as a euphemism versus fish and game. So you know every state the D department environmental conservation in New York. So every state has a different name but it's a State Department that sets hunting and fishing regulations in the new state. The powers to be big boards and they'll be be the people that said it will be biologists various figures different stakeholders. So you'd have representatives from the hunting community representatives who are outside of the hunting community will all come together and come to some level of cohesion and in some level you know they'll find a happy middle ground when they set their quotas and they often mean they meet every year to determine what can be done and not done.

Speaker 9:          00:46:35       And they can control harvest number ways by issuing tags shortening seasons lengthening seasons you can if you want to slow down the harvest you might move the season away from the rut. You know if you want to pick up a harvest kill females you know if you want to if you want to bring a population down because of various factors like agricultural interests auto insurers you know generally want like generally want deer numbers lower agricultural interests generally want deer numbers lower landscape people often want deer numbers lower. So to kind of factor like their concerns and you got the concerns of people who want hunters want more deer they want to see more deer around and you figure all this out there's all these management tools to try to find a way you know to tweak things. Another thing is predator control if you're if you have a population it's really hurting you go in there and do predator control in that area and sometimes you can bring you know you can bring some animals back from the brink.

Speaker 9:          00:47:29       It's possible to lose isolated populations like it's possible to have a mountain range and you get a you spend few hundred thousand dollars a million dollars would ever move in some big horns in there and you find that you're just getting hammered by lions and you will lose all the sheep and lose your whole investment you might go in there and hit those lions a little bit you know save them. So there's so many tools at their disposal but you know in general in general there are exceptions in general I think that I'm always amazed how well the state Fish and Game agencies do Yeah that's what I was going to say it's probably one of the most efficient government agencies ever.

Speaker 10:         00:48:04       They're good and you know everything about them is is they don't get a lot of hard funding there's not many agencies like get so much of their funding from license sales and so firearms taxes. That's why there's so there's a lot of conservation money out there right now because the gun businesses have been blown up as people feel that their gun rights are under attack. They've been buying so many firearms and puts money in the you know the Pittman Robertson filing is called that gold conservation stuff.

Speaker 9:          00:48:35       There's excise taxes on firearms excise taxes on ammunition excise taxes on sporting goods. All your license fees. Every guy whoever hunts ducks are migratory birds has to buy a federal waterfall stamp state waterfalls stamp all his money plows in and creates money for conservation work research and so these agencies are in large measure some more than others are self-sustaining.

Speaker 13:         00:48:58       You know that's what I find things I know that you get annoyed by Peter as much as I do. It's like they're not spending the money on doing this stuff that hunters are like hunters are are bankrolling so much of wildlife research and wildlife conservation.

Speaker 9:          00:49:14       And it's not just stuff that benefits the animals we're after.

Speaker 2:          00:49:17       You know my my problem with groups like PETA or the Animal Liberation Organization the people that want to fucking save lobsters and rescue them from restaurants and thrown back into the ocean. There's a lot of knee jerk reactionary nonsense. It's not based on the actual science of understanding the population these animals. That's what drives me crazy. When people start getting angry at people hunting wolves like this is a perfect example there's they've opened up Wolf season now and a bunch of different places. And the reason being is that people's livestock are getting decimated elk populations are getting destroyed. I mean they they have to move in to control it but to a lot of animal rights people all they see is bloodthirsty maniacs that want to kill beautiful wolves and they don't understand that. First of all a these wolves have been reintroduced. A lot of these areas and then be like we're supposed to be the stewards of the land we're supposed to be the intelligent people that understand the numbers and that something has to be done about it this isn't something that people decide I'd like kill the wolves yeah let's make it legal.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Now they're going hey we've got an issue. What are you going to do. Let's all meet let's compare data. Let's see what we got.

Speaker 9:          00:50:20       Yeah I'm going to do here. Yeah. You get this idea like oh they've just one day decided to go in and do it and it's I'm sure you have. On one level you have individuals who absolutely like a guy opens up his regulation but he's like walking by a wolf type does your that individual does not really need here. That individual does not really need to understand is nice if he does but he doesn't need to understand the full picture because that individual is a tool being used by managing agencies like we need to get rid of some wolves we could bring back the days where we have like you know government agents going out and gun form or we could open it up and have people actually pay money to go out and have the opportunity to try to do what we need to do anyways you know.

Speaker 9:          00:51:05       So the guy that goes out I can't always speak to every guy that goes out in hunts wolves. I can't speak to his motivations I don't know but they're servicing a greater good and that they're being used as a tool that winds up being an economic driver. Which kind of like points to the efficiency of wildlife management is like you could hire the job out which in some cases it does because there are you know we do have government trappers do some Wolf control. But it's kind of nice that you can one up turn like rather than you're paying someone to go out and do it. You can have people pay for the opportunity to go and do what we know needs to be done. And in these cases we're going to have to get rid of half the lower Wolf numbers. No one's not that no one is.

Speaker 9:          00:51:42       No one's arguing for like a new extra patient of the wolf. That would be in the worst interests of the managing agencies. The last thing Wyoming would want now. Like you guys they get the wolves delisted. People are suing to stop the deal. You know the de-listing Wyoming gets the wolves delisted. They're going to control no one in Wyoming and the government would like to see wolves wiped out and put back on the endangered species list. It'd be the worst thing that could possibly happen for them. There's no interest to like extra paid them. You know no one's arguing for extra patients is bringing them into control because we are puppeteers you know I mean there's a lot of people living here in your backyard you're like really balancing a lot of interests you know. And so again it's like like so much in life you really have to take before jumping to the stuff the emotions of you really have to take the time to look at this stuff.

Speaker 17:         00:52:36       It's a long complicated issue.

Speaker 4:          00:52:39       It's long there's a lot of factors and we haven't gotten into ballistics ballistics. No one else trying six now I'll try to explain you all the different caliber. That's not to say it's like the whole world of yes it's that's kind of why I love all this stuff man. It's like it's like chess or something. Well

Speaker 2:          00:52:56       there's new things to learn that's for sure. You know before long before I ever even thought about hunting I would see a beautiful deer and I'd be like Why would anybody kill that is so cool to look at. And then you see a few people hit him with cars. And one time I was driving home I was doing a gig in upstate New York and I had to drive home like 30 miles an hour at the most because fuckin deer were everywhere is madness. It was in the middle of summer and I've never seen more. I don't think I've ever seen more than like two deer my whole life until this day. And then I'm driving home from this gig and it was fucking madness.

Speaker 17:         00:53:33       It was upstate New York in November. I want to say it was the summer but I it was so long gone. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       They were out and about fucking madness just jumping in front of the car left and right you see them on the side of the highway and you see men get plastered by a truck and it opens up like that thing's made of me.

Speaker 8:          00:53:51       I had no idea they were exploding.

Speaker 2:          00:53:53       I mean I saw at least four of them that had exploded and wrecked cars and it was one of the craziest things I'd ever seen in my life. I don't know why there's so many of them in this one particular area of upstate New York but it was a really an infestation.

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       Yeah. People are so whacked out too like it's in those areas in the northeast or you know there's so many deer and they're like well maybe we can hire snipers to go out at night and shoot them or give them a you know we'll put the deer on birth control. Yeah. Meanwhile I got all these dudes being like I've got a great I know the perfect way. Open up you know suburban urban bow hunt people pay to come on. Was like no we'd rather pay. I think I'm in arenas the come out. What was that. By the time they did this deer the town lauds deer population was all sent down. Had a thousand or more dollars into each. Do they got rid of.

Speaker 19:         00:54:44       Well it's going on right now. You know in the Hamptons. Do you know what's going on in the Hamptons. No I also have overpopulation of deer. So they're hiring sniper. Yeah. They're gonna put suppressors on these guns and go in the middle of the night. They're gonna hand at night so that people don't have to experience it or freak out and they're gonna shoot these fucking deer because there's so many of them. And then the other argument was let's let's get them on birth control. They're gonna spend three and a fifty thousand dollar implant give fucking deer birth control like what are you talking about this is there was a TV show about this.

Speaker 10:         00:55:14       Well it's all to prevent the harrowing experience that might happen to someone so they wake up in the morning and realize and see a deer run into their yard and tip over because they had a heroin and as much as upsetting as Abby is so much better to go out and does that night quietly snipe them off. You know there is a line it all up.

Speaker 14:         00:55:33       There's a video of this happening in some other country of. They showed these. That was a joke that video lions released to deal with the deer population that was like The Onion.

Speaker 22:         00:55:45       Jamie's googling shit. Yeah. The Onion you fuck. It was one of those fake onions there's a bunch of onions now fake onion you know the onion if you don't know is a parody website site there's a bunch of fake ones that aren't nearly as good at like being obvious but there's so fake that they say the only known him. No no no. Oh no. They're just like National.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       Blah blah blah report. But they're bullshit they're bullshit like one of them had a report of the day that Colorado legalized marijuana 37 people died of an overdose. Oh fucking I can't tell you how many people sent me that I'm like. Marijuana is not toxic. You dummies like you you'd literally have to smoke fifteen hundred pounds of marijuana in 30 minutes to die. It's not killing anybody stop but these people you know they read this online and they think it's true that there's been a gang of those.

Speaker 23:         00:56:31       Yeah. Has anyone ever died like you ever heard.

Speaker 18:         00:56:34       No one ever dies from marijuana.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       It's not possible. You couldn't you physically wouldn't be able to smoke enough yourself. The the the L.D. 50 like we've we actually we're talking about L.D. 50s of thing. That means lethal lethal dose at 50 percent lethal dose.

Speaker 10:         00:56:51       Oh God I've heard that shit remember. You know because my brother works in his work involves a little bit not the user but the understanding of herbicides and pesticides that he talks about L.D. 50s on pesticides.

Speaker 3:          00:57:02       Yeah. Marijuana is so high it's insane. But there's a lot of things that have really low L.D. 50s ecstasy for instance like if you take I think it's 10 or 15 times the effective dose of MDMA you're dead. Yeah. You eat 10 ounces of salt if you're a 200 pound man eat 10 ounces of salt you're a goner.

Speaker 4:          00:57:23       Zero. Yeah. But think of how upset your body gets when you're snorkeling or something and you get a couple gulps.

Speaker 14:         00:57:29       Oh yeah. Or just you start Rach. Yeah it's salt water. That's a miserable feeling. Well it's also if you want to know if you have like some sort of bowel issue and you want to clean out the old pipes a little bit of it take some Epsom salts and some water to do a couple of tablespoons garlic and shove it down the pipe and it'll be like a broken 5 0. Oh my goodness. It's it's it's unbelievable. It's very effective.

Speaker 20:         00:57:54       I used to wash when I was. I got this job and I was 13 washing dishes at a summer camp. I was washing dishes for campers that were older and I was and there's a cook there. Was David S I'll say and when Dad does he would drink iced tea and I put a bunch of salt in his eyes to mess with him so he'd sit in a big salt and spit it out as retribution. He comes up behind me and kind of puts me in a lock and grabs my forehand and tips my head back and fills my mouth with poured salt Yeah. Wow. Gave me some sauce made me throw up. That's dangerous. Yeah. He probably didn't know that you could die. David S. that fuck.

Speaker 12:         00:58:39       Where are you Dave Davies. Well I'll tell you the name of camp. Camp Pendleton one.

Speaker 14:         00:58:44       Where's that at a West Michigan. Is it still open.

Speaker 9:          00:58:48       Yeah. I've no idea. I don't know why it wouldn't be.

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       Camps are fucking little. They're a little like breeding grounds for criminals. When I was a kid I went to Boy Scout camp for two weeks.

Speaker 12:         00:58:57       It was just a bunch of inner city kids from Boston alone in the woods with very little very little guides like Lord Of The Flies.

Speaker 2:          00:59:04       It was dangerous man. It was I by three days in I was there for two weeks by three days in I realized like this is fucking dangerous you have to keep your eyes open in the middle of the night cause it was dark as shit and kids were getting up in the middle of the night and tying kids to their beds and then leaving them in the woods like Drag. Oh leaping out. You know they would wake up screaming alone in the dark like in the woods. No there's no predators or anything in New Hampshire but it was fucking.

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       No it still brings out a the ruthlessness of youngsters.

Speaker 14:         00:59:35       Yeah. So there was all these activities I just hid and went fishing every day. So you were in the boys game. Yeah I got up in the morning and just said fuck all your fuckin plans I'm going fishing.

Speaker 2:          00:59:46       You took my fishing rod and vanished and they didn't care as long as I was back at the end of the day. They even those gone. No one knew I did the archery things and then I went and fished and that's it.

Speaker 23:         00:59:56       I remember you know I work at the mass ate at Outside magazine and they're telling me that the most letter the the most letter generating article they ever ran was an article that was deemed to be critical of the Boy Scouts could have been another.

Speaker 10:         01:00:17       There had been a number of catastrophes that happened to Boy Scouts that scout camp like look a handful things was a lightning strike.

Speaker 20:         01:00:24       There was a drowning incident this ma thing is an area kind of ran this article like is your kids safe at Boy Scout camp and it really riled the organization up. I think they were Tell me why be the number one letter generating thing ever.

Speaker 2:          01:00:40       Well they don't want to face the reality of the situation. It's not 100 percent safe. If you're going camping it's not 100 percent safe. Most likely you're going to be fine. Statistically you're probably going to be fine. But when you've got a bunch of inner city kids they have fuckin bows and arrows and pocket knives. They're wandering through the woods and there's only like three counselors there was like 30 fucking kids and three people watching us. There was a lot of shit going on. And you know they tried to wake the they grabbed me in the middle of the night but I woke up and I screamed and I jumped out of bed and they let me go and then there's just a bunch of little in your city thugs. And I was young I was probably like at the time maybe twelve maybe 13 somewhere along but there was other kids are like 16 and 17 and they were the ones that were doing shit and they were you know they were the Eagle Scouts the older fucking weirdos that had done this many times they'd they had been camp and three or four years in a row and they had like they were looking forward to it.

Speaker 17:         01:01:33       They were never the way they were the warlords. Man they covered you call closed toothpaste toothpaste doesn't come out of your clothes try washing toothpaste out of your fucking. Example a dribble dribble.

Speaker 19:         01:01:43       I got my take I have no vertical toothpaste when I fucking squirted all over peoples clothes and mash them together and throw it back in you and you pull your clothes on the cover with it was brutal. Just a bunch of little criminals alone in the woods with very little supervision.

Speaker 4:          01:01:56       My old man was involved was real heavily involved in Boy Scouts for a while and I think he'd become an Eagle Scout and I joined Cub Scouts as a kid. But the problem the way it was like my dad was always doing such interesting stuff and would take us to do such interesting stuff. They'd be like you know whatever Wednesday it was a cub scout meeting you could go do like nice things like if you didn't have a dad it'd be great stuff you know. But on one hand like I could go over and we could do like not tying this over that or I could go out deer hunting my dad it's like he always like would kind of trump you know you could do like the way cool stuff.

Speaker 9:          01:02:31       So I never got involved in it but it was it was great for him because he was born like an inner city kid you know and didn't like that. He was born in inner city kids wanted to somehow be out in the woods. For him it was a perfect avenue into it. But then for me it was like a you know you couldn't do his cool stuff doing that as I could hang out with you know my dad and his friends my kids I never got really involved in it when I was in high school.

Speaker 24:         01:02:55       I don't remember the kid's name but someone wrote a really cool article one of that one of the kids in my school about a boy scouts about the problem with the whole the code of the Boy Scouts because one of them was keeping your thoughts clean.

Speaker 11:         01:03:10       It was all right. Yeah I forget the exact words.

Speaker 4:          01:03:12       Let's put up Boy Scout code so you get to thinking about something that you like mannish and be thinking well that's.

Speaker 8:          01:03:18       That was that. That never works.

Speaker 2:          01:03:20       This guy was the guy who wrote this. I remember reading this as I was you know a high school student girls kind of got a really good fuckin point. The point was like What do you give a fuck what I think. Like why are you trying to control my thoughts like I'm not hurting anybody I might think something crazy and deviant but I'm not doing it if as long as I'm not doing it I know exactly what's to keep my thoughts pure.

Speaker 4:          01:03:41       Maybe it's fun for me to entertain ridiculous thoughts but isn't that I know because that's kind of like what self-control is. Mm hmm. Yeah. Like self-control doesn't speak to that thought. The ideas you entertain self-control speaks to like you get an email and you're like I'm going to write a really mean email back and then you it's fun to imagine what you're saying. I mean email. Put it up. That's my you like read. You write a regular email and that is like supposed to be like adult behavior. Exactly. Yeah. Control. Yeah well but you know some role in controlling your actions.

Speaker 14:         01:04:12       You see someone who's an asshole on the car and you want to pull them out of the car and beat him to death but you don't you don't do anything.

Speaker 8:          01:04:17       You just go and you drive down really. Yeah I would. I would pull his fingernails out. So his eyes open and throw salt on them and make us stare at the sun. I never go there.

Speaker 14:         01:04:29       I just go to bone breaking right away. Snap someone's arm. They don't want to fight back.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       Yeah. Trustworthy loyal helpful friendly courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean reverent. A Scout is reverent towards God He's faithful in his religious duties he respects the belief of others. Yeah. Here's the big one. Clean a scout keeps his body and mind fit in clean.

Speaker 25:         01:04:54       That was the one that this guy had a problem with. I remember reading and going yeah the fucking boy scouts are silly kids right but that's not what the fucking scouts were.

Speaker 2:          01:05:04       Wasn't when I when you were in. Well I was I went to my branch was in Jamaica Plain which is not a very nice part of Boston. It's become more gentrified now. Yeah. But in the early late 70s 19 I guess it was 80. Nineteen seventy nine or eighty when I was in it was fucking creeps what push you to get involved in it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       What was your like. You wanted to get out. No

Speaker 2:          01:05:27       I mean I liked fishing. I liked outdoor stuff. I was always into doing stuff from the outdoors and I did a lot of fishing.

Speaker 17:         01:05:33       I was always fishing seems like a good avenue Yeah perceived as good avenue to get out and I just thought it'd be fun something to do.

Speaker 2:          01:05:39       I'd love to be an Eagle Scout. Thought to be a cool thing to be an Eagle Scout you know. But then once I got in I was cool with the scouts until we went camping and that was.

Speaker 14:         01:05:46       Get the fuck out of here and then I was done. I got here so sad to miss my parents so bad. Remember first time I've ever been away for like two weeks by myself. Bunch of fucking criminals in the woods.

Speaker 8:          01:05:56       I came home I was so happy I saw you. I can't imagine now Max got homesick when I was a kid. Yeah I got the opposite of home sick now you know I mean yeah I get homesick as a kid. Well do you find love. I find I travel so much that when I'm home for a couple of weeks I'm like Okay ready. Let's next.

Speaker 9:          01:06:13       I try not to be that you know I try not to but yeah you do. You get used to certain momentum you know when you get home for a while. My wife sometimes point out that you have been home a week and I can tell you you know.

Speaker 8:          01:06:25       Why don't I.

Speaker 14:         01:06:26       The one way I don't get that way is with my kids like I never want to leave my kids. Yeah and whenever I go anywhere I like on vacation. The thing that or on a trip to work. The thing that always gets me is I hate leaving my kids.

Speaker 25:         01:06:39       You know I don't like leaving out but my wife I'm fucking leaving her at all.

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       I love her but I think it's good. I think it's good to get the fuck away from people but just not little kids. But if it was just me and my wife I'd be fucking vacation and calm. I mean how would I be working. I'd say vacation. I did the long term it's going places. It makes me appreciate or more it makes me appreciate my friends more to. Good good. I think there's a balance and I think when you're around someone all the time you don't appreciate them as much as when you go where you miss them and then you come back.

Speaker 20:         01:07:11       I feel that I feel that's true for me.

Speaker 8:          01:07:15       Yeah I got to watch for our sakes I can't imagine. I'm trying to picture my wife going to listen it's just busy all the time you know. But I never know what she might get a free minute someone might tell her about it. That's the real problem. Yeah like a tattletale. When I was little bitches she goes to the gym with I. I just want to say though I love my wife. I love my wife. So if my wife listen and hear that my favorite person ever. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:39       But just like I think that you know like there's a balance you know and part of the balance is appreciating things when you're not there. You know when you when you're gone you appreciate them.

Speaker 4:          01:07:50       You know what. You know my wife was annoyed with me recently I discovered this Waylon Jennings song called Freedom to stay. It's like this dude the narrator Waylon begins where he's got his backpack and he ties it bandanna on.

Speaker 10:         01:08:03       You know and he goes as Dawn as woman sleep and he's gonna go off and roam around you know and be a vagrant and he realizes that everything he wants is here and then the refrain is kind of like you gave me the freedom to go my own way which gave me the freedom to stay. It's like she got annoyed. You know I keep saying it to her and telling her how is our song you know.

Speaker 17:         01:08:30       That she. She liberated me from my desire to be a wonder. Oh that's funny. Well you know you have a very strange life for someone to be married to you. I mean you're constantly gone away hunting. Yeah I'm gone a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:08:42       And you also are gone in places where you don't get any cell phone service. You know you know like you're in the fucking mountains and you know you're off in the landscape you're in New Zealand you're not in these places where you know you're gone and you come back with this dead animal in a cooler.

Speaker 4:          01:08:56       No my life was last like where where were you. Who had gone who was with you. Did you get anything. And she usually likes to ask after I get back. It's like she's the as and has when I'm gone when I get back. She likes to know those things. My three old ones know what I could powered copout. And if we're gonna eat it now she doesn't want to know right. Yeah.

Speaker 13:         01:09:20       Yeah I guess I have I mean I have a very nice existence. You know I got to spend a lot of time going to fantastic places and doing cool stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:09:32       It's a very unusual life for a hunter that you managed to figure out how to make a living doing that.

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       I mean I know I used to think I would make a living like I thought I'd make a living doing that I was gonna make it. I knew I wasn't made.

Speaker 20:         01:09:42       I knew I wanted to make a living hunting when I was a kid. I want to be a professional hunter so I'll try. I'm trapped for a long time and got sold for got really involved like really heavily involved in trapping and you know took lessons and trapping rolling about trapping I'll like to be a professional trapper. The fur prices are so low when I quit trapping those just like wasn't gonna happen and then I hit on this idea that I would write about the write about that kind of stuff instead. And so it's like writing was kind of my plan B. But yeah I thought that I would just live out. You know like when I was a kid I had this dream or this fantasy that I would just live out in the woods and never talk to anybody and hunt you know. And I kind of like made my living like communicating with Soulsby the thing.

Speaker 14:         01:10:26       The one day I was the one thing that wasn't in my plan was I was going to communicate well that's really funny because you're good at it you know and the fact that the writing is there was sort of you know it came about in order to make it so that you can make a living hunting.

Speaker 26:         01:10:41       Know you're a really good writer man mediators a great book.

Speaker 4:          01:10:44       Yeah I enjoy what I enjoy it. I remember when I was in 10th grade I just English teacher Mr. Heaton and I had written an essay I'd written like a comparison contrast paper about Melville and Falconer. So I came here what and for the English class and he's gonna submit your essay to a writing contest. And I forbade him from doing. I can't imagine why.

Speaker 20:         01:11:06       I told my I was gonna do that I don't want to be in the contest presented anyways and I won second place. When I got this letter that I had to go this awards ceremony it mentioned a cash prize super excited I suppose you 250 bucks or something. We go down there and the gal that won the event was at this place called the frozen ball center in Muskegon Michigan. The gal at 1 goes up and gets a check and then I go and they give me a thesaurus and I was just like bombed I thought I got 250 bucks and I was like visibly bomb Mr heating had come to the awards ceremony with me and he said he said something I'll never forget. He's like You know there's far more than 250 dollars worth of words in that book.

Speaker 26:         01:11:50       Yeah that was kind of my genesis as a writer was the idea that the book is worth 250 but no he meant like that if you can capture. No no not his point I mean like you thought you were going to get 250 bucks. No they just change their budget wasn't what it was.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       I mean I never had a satisfactory answers the wide and get to him 50 bucks but I went there wanting my check and come out of this book. I slammed the thesaurus. You know do you really. Yeah that's fine. Now keep in mind box like specials.

Speaker 26:         01:12:18       How did you wind up doing the wild within. That was that was how I found out about you. You were on a show on the trial channel it was called the wild within it was an interesting show. The first episode I ever watched you were going to take the same route that Lewis and Clark took and you shot a moose and turned it into a boat made a bobo out of a Buffalo Buffalo. That's what it was. Yeah. You shot it with a musket too right. I mean you want like the show business story about how I did but what made you decide to be on TV like we did.

Speaker 9:          01:12:46       I would periodically like as a writer I would periodically get called by producers and developers about stuff I had written or they would kind of summon you you know like you might get a phone call or you get an email and then a phone call an email through a magazine or whatever and realize that some guy at History Channel wants you to come down and and what they do is they're desk bound individuals and they're obligated to go into these meetings you know and have like some ideas. And so when they're putting together their portfolio of ideas they would like to go contact writers or people who are out doing interesting stuff in the hinterlands you know and come in kind of report about what's exciting at the time. And I'd gone to a number of these meetings over the years about stories I had written and every time you get the e-mail you're like Oh my God. Be on TV and it would never work out. But eventually I signed a development agreement after I wrote my first book scavengers God or cuisine which I just got the rights back to the book sells like there's so few those books out there that they sell on Amazon for like 130 bucks.

Speaker 4:          01:13:51       Really. And I just they just like Miramax The Weinstein Company just gave me my rights back. Wow. In a move that would benefit them in no way whatsoever. Just like out of the goodness of their hearts like gave me the rights to my book back. Why they do that. Like know lonely as much as people like to talk about Harvey Weinstein being like the worst guy on the planet. I don't know that I know that his companies gave me my books rights back. I didn't even try to get money out of me just gave him to me.

Speaker 26:         01:14:20       I've never heard of the worst guy on the planet people telling you horror stories. You know I've never heard any horror stories. But I don't have any.

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       Here's a great book or a great documentary detailing a horror story that he dealt with. Those are right. Yeah it's called overnight.

Speaker 12:         01:14:35       Oh if you see that's a great movie. Yeah. And that guy was to blame and that thing. But yeah yeah that guy like the cover of it is him hold the camera to his head like that. That's a phenomenal movie.

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       If he fucks it on now if you haven't seen it it's about the producer writer whatever of said fuck and shoot him out scenes. Yeah. Boondock Saints. Yeah.

Speaker 26:         01:14:56       Terrible FUCKIN MOVIE BY THE WAY. DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME THAT'S GOOD. NO I WON'T. BUT NOT YOU.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       I mean whoever you are out there you fucking freaks like that. People have told me that's good. And I watch nose like I made it 20 minutes and I was like this is a piece of shit. Terrible movie. I didn't know anything.

Speaker 18:         01:15:12       I watched it after the documentary. I was like I watch I my I go see this movie but it only validates that you know validates the movie.

Speaker 27:         01:15:18       Yeah well do you know what it came out of it came out of Pulp Fiction. There's that. Yes this whole breed of this genre that came out of Pulp Fiction. But what they don't have sent Pulp Fiction is a fucking genius movie from a genius movie maker.

Speaker 20:         01:15:36       I mean Quentin Tarantino is a bad mother fucker do when I want to see that movie it felt like like like like something came down from the heavens and touched my forehead.

Speaker 8:          01:15:46       I had never seen him like I didn't know anything about like cool.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       I was blown away but it's so complex and there's so many layers to the timeline switched around and meets it's a genius work of film and then this fucking dummy came along and decided to make this shoot him up and there's gonna be why fuck you fuckin fuck and fuck fuck fuck and bang bang bang.

Speaker 3:          01:16:08       And it's just it's an assault on your intelligence it's shit and I just thought it was a piece of shit and then I watched this documentary on the guy who made it was like Oh and being it's a great job I don't know anything about the guy that made that movie It's a great job and a movie.

Speaker 19:         01:16:23       Yeah well I mean the people who made it look the guy whoever made overnight like a phenomenal job with the guys who made it were the guys who were involved with him in the beginning yeah they were documenting this this rise to fame they were supposed to be documenting this guy who worked at a bar Harvey Weinstein signed him to this gigantic deal and buys the bar and they're gonna own the bar together and make giant movies together they just were convinced this guy was brilliant and meanwhile he's like saying Alec anti-Semitic stuff and he's just ego that the documentary is about ego and if if you're a person who's like you planning on any sort of a career in show business I think it's a must watch because I've seen those people I've never met him but I've seen a hundred guys like him that didn't make it.

Speaker 3:          01:17:08       I've met a hundred of those guys they were convinced that they're the baddest motherfuckers it's fucking towns.

Speaker 1:          01:17:13       Never seen anybody like us before we're gonna fucking run this town.

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       I've met those guys I've met so many of them and acting and the film business breeds them it somehow or another the idea of acting first of all is responsible for a lot of disproportionate egos egos that are not based on anything realistic they're based on your ability to pretend and then not even based on you being really good at pretending sometimes but you being famous for pretending and these people just because the camera's on them and the people pay attention them have these enormous insane egos I've seen it on sitcoms sets. I've seen it in movies I've seen the actors I've seen and the madness like the reality of of life escapes them they they they are insulated from it completely and they live in this world where the camera's on them and there they have this idea that because the camera's on them they must be special so because they're special. But there is no ego check there's no answer then you know to get. OK like to put it in the honey terms like say please say it's OK.

Speaker 27:         01:18:24       If you're gonna go after a very difficult animal to track OK I'll say if you're gonna go after Himalayan tar yeah OK you're gonna fucking climb through the mountains it's an incredibly difficult task it takes a long time to get there you might not see one for days when you finally do see one sheet like this mule deer that the skull that's unstable is perfect example you and I hiked around for days we walked seven hours we worked our asses off and it's a haul.

Speaker 1:          01:18:53       So when that thing actually when I actually shot it and it dropped and then we brought it back it was like wow like we did it we did something. Whereas if if that thing was in a pen okay and I walked up and shot it in the face I would have zero feeling of accomplishment. Well acting is a lot like shooting an animal in the face. It's a lot like shooting a penned up animal in the face like you're not really some Special person you're just someone who's crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:19:19       So you're good at pretending because you don't really have a self identity or your self identity community be manipulated in you know or you're your personality can manipulate it in a role.

Speaker 4:          01:19:29       This is what you're saying has validity because you do it you act.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       I have I have acted I avoid it for that very raw because I feel like those people are sick I feel like there's something about that occupation where you pretend to be like you know many people I've met that like they play tough guys in movies so they think they're tough they're fucking crazy I've met so many of them it's it's a sick way to make a living it's it's some people pull it off and they become really sensitive people like Henry Winkler The Fonz Yeah.

Speaker 26:         01:20:03       One of the nicest fucking guys I ever met. I'll tell you I haven't heard that I've heard from multiple people. He's a sweetheart fly fisherman. No I've heard that from old people wrote a book about it.

Speaker 28:         01:20:12       I've never met an idiot on the river his.

Speaker 4:          01:20:15       Yeah yeah I've not heard of it and I've heard from older people what it was like. It looks like how surprised people are what a great guy you talk to him you would have known he played a tough guy.

Speaker 8:          01:20:23       Yeah he could turn on and turn off electric appliances by punching the wall. Please don't go to your high too which is really what I mean I'm a short guy and he's tiny me it's weird. You know like this guy was like this tough guy on this show. How did that ever work. Yeah. He would walk into a bathroom and bang the wall and run out of the bathroom and he would talk. He tells Cordero and they're good at it. He's good at it too man. But you know I've met.

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       I mean my point is I've met a lot of really nice actors. It's not a broad sweeping generalization but I think that the occupation itself is it's so unchecked like up Tommy Francis is very checked. Like if you're a funny comedian the you the reason why you're funny. Yeah. You have to write the meat. You have to write the comedy.

Speaker 27:         01:21:08       You have to perform it. You bomb you reassess. You go back to the drawing board. You have to figure out how to do it. Once you actually get to doing it there's a certain amount of humility like after ten years of doing that almost all comedians possess. When you talk to them about comedy even if they're really good at they'll never tell you like I'm I'm a bad motherfucker I'm the baddest motherfucker that ever got on stage.

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       They know you live a flop in such an immediate way. MAN Yeah you die you fucking you eat shit up there. It happens so often you crushes your ego.

Speaker 18:         01:21:39       I get the badge you guys like. You just watch you go ahead. It's like a movie like you make it there's all this excitement stuff and later it doesn't do well. You're like up there going like this is not going well. Well I never done it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:48       I could just imagine how humiliating Am I the way I described is like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother. It's actually probably worse than that because it's somewhere out there that someone that would like to suck a thousand dicks in front of his mother.

Speaker 19:         01:22:00       Nobody wants to bomb on stage. Now just a horrible crushing him. But along the way one of the things you learn is to be really good at comedy. You you you have to lose all of your sense of self-importance. You have to lose all of that pretending you're something special like you're not something but you're just a person. And the best way to do comedy is almost to be non-existent. Like you you're you when you write and when you perform there's almost no you in there unless it's a self-deprecating aspect of it like you're you're pointing out things that are silly about you or pointing out ridiculous ideas he might have had in your head at one point in time but other than that like when you're performing you're never thinking man. I'm up here and I'm killing. You don't think of that at all like in fact you're almost like a passenger in this weird ride that you've put together.

Speaker 19:         01:22:49       Yeah I go and you all you know is that you kind of know how to do it and all you know is that you kind of have to keep at it in order to continue do it. And it's really fun to do. But the moment you start taking it serious or tripping in it all of the success of it to you being super special and amazing and unique you fucking suck. But where did your comedy suffers. Oh it goes terribly wrong. Yeah. Because people know that they don't want to laugh at you. Part of laughing at you is like you have to belong in the moment of what you're doing and if you're in the moment of what you're doing the last thing you gonna be thinking about is how awesome you are. Like that doesn't come up whereas an actor like you can pretend that there's something really special about you. Like when that ready action and then you do this role and you you play this guy it's all pretend it's all bullshit. So there's the checking aspect to being the ego check and the creative process the tuning in that does is nonexistent.

Speaker 4:          01:23:45       We were treated probably around you. You treat with a certain amount of deference to that you're not going to get us doing standup.

Speaker 19:         01:23:50       Exactly. They're treated like we were treated like shit. The commune is a way you know people like you if you're good and they appreciate that. But no one like takes it seriously as an art form. Yeah it's one of the reasons why plagiarism was so he's so a huge problem with comedy whereas it was treated with you know if you think about plagiarism in literature there's lawsuits and people's careers are really like you'll you'll be disrespected. Music massive lawsuits. I mean people have lost millions of dollars just for a riff like one of my favorite examples is there's a great song by the verb Bittersweet Symphony idealism but that riff is stolen from the Rolling Stones. So because of that those guys made nothing. They didn't make anything. No. Yeah they had to give it all away. I still like that sounds great song but the lyrics are great it's interesting but there's no doubt about it. That riff comes from the Rolling Stones. Stones to remember oh you know you know this little bit.

Speaker 26:         01:24:44       I think maybe you forgot. I'm going to see you on January 30 first. Oh yeah yeah. Oh cool. Is that sold out. Yes we talk about yeah. Not sold out.

Speaker 17:         01:24:50       It's been sold out for months the last time. What is it. The last time. The rings. That's those are the last time.

Speaker 4:          01:24:55       Yeah I will. After I saw you last time when I went to see you in New Jersey. We were driving home my wife was saying to me she's like my face hurts. From laughing at heart and I want to write a thing I want read a thing like that. I want to envision writing something called like the only happy comedian because he's like I don't understand comedy at all but you got to think you come at it from a position of strength in some way you'd like it. Like so much stuff is funny because it's like from a place of self-loathing. Like so many comedians do like a self-loathing thing and I to be real. It's like it's kind of like they're just where it spawns from is like self-hatred. And I'm so pathetic you know. I mean it was like fire that you build a whole act bill whole act and like come. Like you're at a position of strength. I'll have you ever think of it that way. But like you're up there like you seem like when you're up there you seem somehow like in control and you know like a word you like in control and powerful but still funny. It's a weird contradiction because we get from stand up we get to thinking like it's just like Yeah my wife don't like me. No one likes me I'm awful. I can't do anything.

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       Well people have always said that you know you have to be nebbish she or fat or weird to be a comedian guy. I was so I was told that so much that I was insecure about my body.

Speaker 12:         01:26:14       When I first started doing comedy that's kind of what I'm saying. They could be like No I'm fine. Yeah. Like if I wasn't doing this I'd be fine. We could be doing something else.

Speaker 2:          01:26:22       The thing about comedy is that there's no rules. There's no rules. I mean there's there's sort of laws to it but there's no rules. You know there's there's laws and some of the laws are that it has to be funny to you and that you you have to learn it and that everybody's different. Like there's Mitch Hedberg who is like you familiar Mitch Oh yeah I mean I've got a good match.

Speaker 18:         01:26:43       I've got a good match that works really well.

Speaker 27:         01:26:45       We'll get in that one of my all time favorites but there's also Sam Kennison two completely different styles of comedy to my all time favorite comedians. There's it's all based on what is the world through your eyes and what what I find funny. It's funny coming out of me it's coming out of my mouth my mind. But if you gave my act to Demetri Martin I probably be Bill put off you know the more violent physical aggressive aspects of my act. It wouldn't work. You know it works because it's funny to me. It's obviously funny to me. Yeah. And I'm being honest. Like when when I talk about the things that I think are funny it's because I've thought about it. I've this is these are things that I honestly find amusing. I'm not lying.

Speaker 4:          01:27:24       So you don't sit around and think like what would be something funny I could say never. What I did is jumps in your head. Yeah I mean like I will convert this now into my comedy.

Speaker 2:          01:27:32       Well I've it's taken a long time. I see the stages of comedy the first stage is you're absolutely terrified and all you're trying to do is get a laugh in any way shape or form and I think of jokes in that stage as tools. All you're trying to do is get by. You do like usually in the beginning like when you're an open mike comedian you've got five minutes on stage and those five minutes are fucking harrowing ride through hell. And when it's over like who I got a couple laughs. All right. You know I didn't I didn't die. And then occasionally you will die and then you think about quitting. And many many times I thought about quitting was like Fuck that I can't do this anymore is to Davis you can't handle getting beat up like that you're an easy the the punishment that your self-esteem takes when you bomb on stage is all almost overwhelming.

Speaker 27:         01:28:16       Like for it for some people I've seen guys bomb and never recover. I've seen them like their act diminishes like they had some potential there's something there and then I seen like one night where the fuckin wheels come off and then they never they never recover.

Speaker 3:          01:28:31       It's almost like a beating that a fighter takes. I've seen fighters take beatings and not even just the physical punishment of it but the confidence destruction of it yeah just they they're never the same guy again they never become that carefree cocky guy again. It just goes away you know. And with that so does their fighting career I've seen that happen with comedians as well. So the beginning is just tools. And then once you do that then somewhere along the line you go okay. I'm pretty confident that I have some tools. Now what do I think it's funny. What would I laugh at. This is what's funny to me. And then we come up with stuff that's funny to you. And then there's a stage three that comedians may or may not ever even get into.

Speaker 19:         01:29:11       And that is how do you make your ideas funny ideas like philosophy. Like how do you have a point of view and figure out a way to impart that point of view on people.

Speaker 4:          01:29:20       Like for me this a thing I'm doing and just so just so I'm clear when you talk about you talk about moving away from just like jokes. Yes. Like what does this do.

Speaker 2:          01:29:29       It's this like taking like a like a philosophy's or trying to figure out a way to get an idea in to turn that idea into comedy trying to maybe maybe a controversial idea maybe an idea that you think is important maybe maybe just a thought because there's a way to introduce an idea into someone's brain.

Speaker 4:          01:29:49       Give me an example of an idea. Well can you pull.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       I mean can you throw one else hard to do this what is it to say. Like say like if you go on stage and say Say if you're a Republican and you're on stage and you start going off about you know gay marriage or this or that you know you just give a speech.

Speaker 19:         01:30:05       Yeah if I'm in the audience and I have an opposing point of view I go I'll fuck you I don't like your opinion I think that's wrong. And I think people should be able to do this. But if you go on stage and say something that makes me laugh yeah even if I don't agree with you even though I don't agree with if you make me laugh I have to at least consider your idea. I have to at least you've you've introduced like here's a prime example.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       I had a guy who came up to me who is a Christian and I say do this bit about Noah's ark that if you told no one in the Ark to an eight year old retarded boy he's gonna have some questions. So I had this whole bit about you know someone sitting down with this young retarded boy telling them the story of Noah's Ark. Yeah yeah. And it's this it was a really long bet. It was like and this guy came out to mangle. I got to tell you man look I'm a Christian. And you started talking about Noah's Ark and I started getting offended.

Speaker 19:         01:30:57       And he goes but two or three minutes into that fucking bed. I was laughing so goddamn hard I started thinking What the fuck. How is that a real story.

Speaker 22:         01:31:05       And he started laugh and he goes I just wanna say congratulations you made me laugh at something that's completely opposed to my own beliefs.

Speaker 27:         01:31:11       This is this is a video where a guy came up to me after a show in Georgia here play this is because it is kind of funny. You know this guy told me he found Noah's Ark on a mountain archaeology sites and look for a documented.

Speaker 29:         01:31:26       Battle. You know check it out and say OK. And we actually fund expeditions to back up where somebody claims I'm going to tell you. That the shots I'll show you. What kind of blow your mind but our job is not to say what it is right. Our job is just confirm what they face. So I think you say maybe they believe you. I'm confused though. You really believe that Noah's Ark. Well let me let me take. Well. Let me tell you. When. We first of all they did find a boat shaped object in the mountains of Ararat that's five hundred fifteen feet long.

Speaker 30:         01:32:01       That should be enough for all the animals. Nothing or. Something about a hundred million species that seems we're gonna. Well I don't know. OK. It's about five as long as I need to hit us off. Yeah can you even get the 500 foot thing. Anyway if you suck shots. How many. Just the things were found. It's a cool thing at the very least you might be able to use a moment. Isn't it possible that maybe it's just a hoax. Yeah. Well why would anybody assume that that boat wouldn't pick. Any there would be any connection in history to a crazy story to do to get all the animals to come on his boat against God talked to told us that the rain was going to drown everybody because everybody wasn't paying attention.

Speaker 31:         01:32:42       We this thing we're all like that. He makes out all but how could that be Noah's Ark case. Well I don't know. You don't actually you don't actually have wood there anymore. Whatever it is is great. It's about even if it was a solid boat it still seems the only thing. Unless you're like a carnival ship right next to Rhino ship. Well I said glad you said we didn't have samples. Yeah camel shakes. We've taken core samples found different species of animals remains.

Speaker 32:         01:33:08       We've got twelve. No they didn't. We've got twelve anchors again should be about enough for a home away. Isn't in the way of animals. It was probably more than that of about twelve.

Speaker 29:         01:33:18       What do you do when you find this on a six thousand foot peak in the hills. But at the very least I could just show you what they are without a doubt this earth is over the last.

Speaker 33:         01:33:30       Thousands of thousand years gouges and pretty capped huge cataclysmic events. You mean they know for a fact that at one point in time where Montana is right now that's where all the Megalodon find megafauna fossils that gigantic shark is juicy. They find them in the mountain amounts of Montana which that's six million years. So they know that no matter what there's some crazy shit happen to this planet. Without a doubt. So it's very conceivable that at one point in time it was a huge flood in that region. And that's why there's a stack up there.

Speaker 29:         01:33:58       It's very possible it is pretty possible. But but I can't confirm we do have something that matches dead and that's what story is.

Speaker 32:         01:34:05       Well I love that I use that term. No do have good Gilgamesh is the original one.

Speaker 29:         01:34:10       Yeah it's one of the oldest ones that we know. But it's it's a cool coincidence.

Speaker 33:         01:34:14       Yeah well I think. I think what the story of Noah's Ark is where it really is all about is that at one point in time I think there was a huge disaster and it's probably happened more than once where like meteors hit or you know what's in the polar ice caps or something huge. Fortunately he kills like 90 percent of people at the level that are remaining. They have a story. Story of a great disaster and some people got away and those stories the story of the great disaster and some person got away over time that person becomes the great hero of the Savior. They talk about around the campfire and is and legend grows. And when you have a story that's told in oral tradition for over a thousand years it's everywhere in nature Hebrew. And to this day they only know three or four words ancient Hebrew.

Speaker 33:         01:34:53       To this day 25 percent all the words are told they have no idea what it means. And in ancient Hebrew there was no numbers. So letters also double its numbers. So you lose all the numeric value that's important the text like the word God and the word love. They have the same numeric value. And that's very important for sentencing. And when I was translated into Latin translated The Greek they lost all of that shit and that's all these stories that are distorted thousands years of people bullshitting around a campfire to the original tax being indecipherable to what they have today. How can anybody think that's real. You would have. To be. Fucking. Crazy to think that that really happened to God talk to one guy and got all the animals from all over the world and put him on a boat that it makes zero sense when you know people are liars you know people are weak. You know even most religious people are completely full of shit. And if after all that you think that that storage room that's insane. When you actually see the evidence about.

Speaker 14:         01:35:53       Well that guy obviously didn't listen or you know that the ideas didn't get into his head but you can't.

Speaker 4:          01:36:00       But he was so kind about it kind.

Speaker 8:          01:36:03       He never threatened you. He didn't want to kill you or anything. Well I can't. Well I don't think he was religious.

Speaker 14:         01:36:09       He was a documentarians All right. I believed that he had found Noah's Ark Yeah.

Speaker 20:         01:36:14       There was probably not the best one thing but when he. But one thing the bones.

Speaker 12:         01:36:19       They can't. They better not be there. Fine. Because they only had two of each. So they died.

Speaker 14:         01:36:24       Well that could've been the unicorns bone. Yeah. If that's true right. If they died then what the fuck. Unless they bred before they died.

Speaker 4:          01:36:31       That could have been the longtime. I'll tell you one thing though. You're kind of getting at this like the way the guy came up to you and he said like you were offending me but I was funny. I think I struggle with like you talked to really liberal people and you like Rush. You know Rush Limbaugh is funny sometimes it's funny. It's that makes him so mad. We I really conservative would be like you know Jon Stewart is so you can be pretty funny get mad they get real mad at you. They can't imagine I'm ever like when you were doing part of your act or talking about when people get really mad at comedians for saying some of the comedy years. And you kind of you mentioned like how come no one's mad at Johnny Cash. You're shooting a man just to watch him die. It didn't really happen.

Speaker 8:          01:37:10       Yeah that's a big that's the important thing. Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man in Reno. That didn't really happen. This is cop.

Speaker 2:          01:37:17       Well that's the thing about comedy is it's an easy target and for people that are looking to be offended which is like a lot of bloggers and people looking to find something to be outraged about they'll they'll point to comedy because comedy is a soft target. You know a lot of comedians will say fuck that. There's an art form. No

Speaker 17:         01:37:33       one's always wanted to kill novelists. Now let's use Solomon Rushdie a long time ago. People aren't always going to kill novelists. There's a card. The cartoonists who got stabbed in Holland do to Muslims people go after most. It's like I was killed right. Yeah he was murdered.

Speaker 2:          01:37:46       Yeah he's just a cartoonist you know. Yeah it's like the soft target of comedy is the idea that there's this like this real subtlety to language and there's a subtlety to sarcasm and being facetious and you know when someone's being sarcastic but if you just see it written down on paper you can for just for purposes of being morally outraged you can pretend that you don't know that it's sarcastic. Yeah and you could pretend that this is just a horrible statement and people got in trouble for that many many many times especially when you take something like on Twitter like in a text form. Yeah and you try to pretend that that's a statement and you try to pretend that oh this is just someone who's you know this is an asshole. This is the person is just a really evil mean person. No no it's this is a person who's fucking around like there's an art form to saying fucked up things that you don't really mean.

Speaker 22:         01:38:38       Yeah like you could say something fucked up and I know that you're not serious so I'll start laughing and then we'll go that's so wrong. But but it's we know it's funny because it's not a statement. Yeah not exactly.

Speaker 27:         01:38:49       But there is like this P.C. police thing going on now where a bunch of people who in most of time when you pay attention to those people because I find it fascinating and I try to consider myself to be a student of human nature and one of the things that I find about these people that complain so much about all these different things and then they find this moral outrage or find one thing to harp on over and over again to say they usually extremely troubled personally they usually like they it's usually like they have overwhelming issues like they're morbidly obese or they're you know socially inept or there's something wrong with them that's causing them to find this soft target Yeah lash out constantly at this soft target and then also if you look at like what they do a lot of people what they do is like Dell what they're trying to do is stop someone from hurting someone's feelings and they're they're trying to say that what you're doing is mean and you're hurting someone's feeling so what I'm gonna do is hurt your feelings in the most vicious and cruel way possible you know with with these blogs and the writing and I'm going to do to you what you're somehow or another doing to him being be a complete total hypocrite.

Speaker 27:         01:40:03       Yeah but I have a license I have this license of moral outrage I have this moral high ground that I'm going to stand on so I'm going to attack and I'm going to you know to write this vicious snarky column about a comedian in the ideas that they're trying to right the wrongs and trying to be the savior of what's good in the world. But that's not the case. What they're doing is just being an asshole because they feel like they have a license to be an asshole because they can take what you said and put it on paper and say look in quotes Tracy Morgan said if his son was gay he'd stab them in quotes. So yeah fuck Tracy Morgan but Tracy Morgan's a ridiculous person like his whole act is a bunch of shit that he doesn't mean. Yeah it's a bunch of crazy things that have never happened and he says a bunch of crazy things because that's that's his style of comedy like Mitch Hedberg style of comedy is to say really preposterous things that other people wouldn't like. My favorite Mitch Hedberg joke is somebody asked me if I wanted a frozen banana. I said no but I want a regular banana later.

Speaker 1:          01:41:09       So yes so you know anybody else says that it's a terrible joke but if he says it's really funny that's his style. Tracy Morgan's Tyler's must almost got stabbed to new. He doesn't really mean that. That's not it's not a statement. It's no he's not writing that down.

Speaker 27:         01:41:26       He didn't carved in stone and bring it down from the top of a hill. It's his art form.

Speaker 4:          01:41:31       But what's more upsetting than the people who are so volatile and do get so mad about stuff is the thing that politicians do which is to feign that response. Yes like you politicians you know you look at their career they vacillated wildly between all these positions but they love to get up and act like to act like the morally outraged guy. Yes by thinking they were you know like when you look in his eye like you don't care at all about that but you're like feigning the guy who is that way. And that's more of saying that's the one who really is mad about it.

Speaker 14:         01:42:04       Yeah well sometimes people are mad about something that's just a perspective issue. They just lack perspective or they lacked a lot of it is a lack of social intelligence you know.

Speaker 2:          01:42:13       And there's also a lack of having nuanced friends having friends that have good sense of humor. People that joke around death things or say mean things like some of my favorite people like Jim Norton is one of my favorite comedians and is my favorite guy on the radio because he says ridiculous evil mean shit all the time. But he doesn't mean it he'll laugh after he says it. Yeah but he's really smart about how he does it and he takes a tremendous amount of grief because of it because people will try to point out some of the things that he says and then you know and accuse him of being you know homophobic or this that one of the least homophobic guys you'll ever meet in fact he will talk openly about how many experiences he's had with trannies he's had like all these transsexual expects a pervert complete total pervert but he's like he owns it in and way. And you know he takes grief because he's a soft target because you know you can point to look they're looking for someone to say outrageous shit so they can be angry. So who more likely to say outrageous shit and someone says outrageous shit for a living. And sometimes they say outrageous shit and it doesn't work. You know it's not funny but Patrice O'Neal had a great point about that. The late great Patrice O'Neal one of my was that he's a really funny comedian who died. Yeah.

Speaker 27:         01:43:33       He's one of my favorite guys to talk about controversial point because you had a unique way of looking at it but is his point was always that like when someone says something and trying to be funny and it misses and it's fucked up that comes from the same place as someone trying to say something funny and it hits and it's really funny and you laugh like just because they miss you you know with this attempt doesn't mean they're like an evil mean person they just failed.

Speaker 18:         01:43:57       Yeah that's a good boy.

Speaker 19:         01:43:58       You know it's not they're not trying to hurt someone's feelings they're trying to get a laugh and that's what what comedy is. There's a there's a real art to that.

Speaker 13:         01:44:07       But but yeah you're right.

Speaker 12:         01:44:10       I mean that's a cop that's that's a complicated idea and is very complicated.

Speaker 11:         01:44:14       Well you know my friend Joey Diaz did he will open up for me. Yeah I love that fucking no man funny. He's hilarious. The funniest guy I've ever met in my life. But he has this joke about transvestites.

Speaker 1:          01:44:24       He goes I love transvestites. They cook they clean you can beat on every once in a while the cops come. Who's going to believe me as some dude with a wig and a black eye. Okay look Joey Diaz has never punched a transvestite he's never he's never had a transvestite over his house with a wig and had him cooking cleaning. It's not true. It's a joke like you could say that's a violence against transsexuals joke or violence against transvestites Joe but it's not it's not promoting violence against anybody. It's a joke. It's a fucked up thing that he's saying. And you know it's it's got a good joke.

Speaker 3:          01:44:58       It's a great joke. My fave one of my favorite jokes of all time. But you gotta understand what it actually is what it actually is. It's just it's it's just like Johnny Cash pretending he shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. It's is exactly the same thing.

Speaker 4:          01:45:12       But I wish Patrice O'Neal. Yeah yeah yeah he yes. Yeah I wish she was here because there's so it's like you've been in a situation where someone said something that they wanted to be funny. Yes. Let's say they're made that someone makes a crack about gays. Mm hmm. And it flops a way that it can flop is if it if they're so transparent that you see a win you see in them for a minute and you're like wow that really comes yeah from a place of deep hatred yes yes yes. And it's not funny because in that I got a glimpse into that. Mm hmm. You know yes if you make a gay joke I know from I don't know why from your demeanor whatever it is I know that you're not at home you know wishing you'd go out and kill gay people right. How do I know that. Well it allows you to explore like a funny idea you know. But sometimes some say something like man this person really has a problem with black people who are in a power position. It's like you see it.

Speaker 27:         01:46:21       It's intent the intent becomes transparent when when someone is a kind person and someone just pointing out hypocrisy like I have this bit making fun of Marci. Marcy is the lead singer of The Smiths do it.

Speaker 4:          01:46:35       But how soon is now is a rock solid song. But I know you're more it's not laughed at. Yeah I should. I was like the know a guy because I could come out and said You know what I like how soon is now with that shit about Maurice.

Speaker 27:         01:46:45       He was funny. He makes he makes good music. He doesn't make good music but his idea that you know all you know war is created by heterosexuals. Yeah. It's not only not supported by history but it's her day. But the point is like when I when I talk about that onstage I make a big point out of the fact that I want to make sure that like I don't want anybody to think that I have any problem gay people. But I also don't want any gay people to just take random jabs at the giant mass of straight people and say we're responsible for all the wars it's fucking it's all ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:47:19       And if you make as a 10 percent of the wars where the response were came at you know we're the gays responsible for 10 percent of the wars and it would upset the theory.

Speaker 27:         01:47:29       Well all you'd have to do is look at history like the Spartans all the gay Athenians the Romans all the gay sex they had.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       I think a lot of time fighting bastards that Alexander the Great is one of the greatest conquerors ever he's gay as fuck you know. I think that one of the the things about people that are in a group is they always want to assume that this is the good group to be in you know. And the idea that all gay people are cool is ridiculous because people are people. There's a huge range of how people can behave you know whether it's gay people or straight people like there's a there's a bit I do about I used to work out at this gay gym and these gay dude used to hit on me all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:48:11       At this I used to work out at Gold's Gym on Cole Street and because it was so gay that because you were there it was assumed you must be gay.

Speaker 19:         01:48:18       Well they were just you're a man. It's like if you're a guy and you go to a gym and there's a hot lesbian working out there you know are you gonna just you do you gonna take a shot.

Speaker 27:         01:48:28       Yeah they can try to find out how lesbian and I got you know and the the idea that gay guys are immune for from sexual harassment they're not going to sexually harass you because they're from this marginalized group. So they would they would be different there'd be they would be kinder and sweeter and more and more bullshit they're dudes with dicks.

Speaker 1:          01:48:50       They'll spike your drink just like a straight guy will spike your drink. A gay guy will spike your drink. Of course there's gonna be gay guys in my group drink fuck yeah. Gay guys would roof you just like a straight guy I would root for you.

Speaker 27:         01:49:02       The idea that someone is really super cool just because they're gay is ridiculous. It's just like the idea of someone being super cool because they're black you know like marginalized groups have a little bit of leeway with a lot of like knee jerk reactionary bleeding heart liberals which is why guys like Al Sharpton is allowed to be on television. Al Sharpton is a con man and an idiot. But yet he represents black people on television because no one wants the same thing about him because he's black. If you pick on Al Sharpton you're picking on marginalized people and you are therefore a racist because he represents brown people. Look at his skin he's a brown guy. He's allowed to say. But meanwhile if you follow his career I mean the guy made his living off of the Tawana Brawley thing where there was a fake rape where he you know he came out and had this gigantic protest and it turns out that this woman Tawana Brawley was never really raped in the first place she made it all up. Yeah and he was the champion of all this. It was you know attacking white people and attacking white America and the racist establishment has allowed this to happen. Actually not really. You're kind of a con man. You know and what you're doing is you're taking advantage of a weakness in the system.

Speaker 4:          01:50:09       I just had occasion. I'm not going to go into. I had. OK I just read the first and last chapter of al sharpton the most recent book. No like the second or third chapter in the last chapter. I read the second or third chapter and it kind of changed. I kind of I wrote his opinion about it from I like that's really like. Like he had it. He made an interesting point about something and expressed it really well and he got talked about his own evolution. He went through on an idea like a flip. He explained what would be in politics a flip flop. He did a big flip flop and kind of walked through how a public figure does a flip flop. No good then read the last chapter and I just went back to being.

Speaker 8:          01:50:49       Who you are.

Speaker 4:          01:50:51       I've read those folks I'm reading that book on about it with their money. No no no no never mind the good times. And every now about a guy comes out to me and this guy looks like a yachtsman. Like a good guy or on a yacht. And he comes at me because he goes Sharpton.

Speaker 20:         01:51:10       I had a meeting with Al Sharpton one time he came in in a chauffeured car and he was wearing a gold Rolex presidential watch and the first thing he tells me is how he survives on a ten thousand dollars salary. Then the guy left walked on the street. Now at the end of the story was a Sharpton story.

Speaker 14:         01:51:34       He's what would they call a race pimp. You know I think that's the best way to describe him. He him and you know Jesse Jackson has made a lucrative business out of going to businesses and saying you don't have enough diversity in your businesses hire me as a consultant.

Speaker 2:          01:51:50       He steps in as a consultant and gets an exorbitant amount of money to try to teach them how to hire black people in their businesses. If they don't do it he's going to protest them. And that's the the insinuation behind all of it. And it's the only reason why it exists is because there has been racism no reason why exists because black people have been marginalized that evil things have taken place. And then two hundred years ago black people were slaves. All those things are absolutely true. So there's this there's you know this reality to what they're saying that there is racism there is inequality. So there's someone is coming along as capitalizing on that that problem but it's not. There's no Martin Luther King's life I was like at my house here the day my wife was playing a Martin Luther King speech because Martin Luther King Day is Monday and my daughter's like who's Martin Luther King. So my wife is playing this speech for our five year old.

Speaker 4:          01:52:41       And you know what was it the promised lands. Yes yeah. I got to make what a speech got gentler speech. Well it's like I'm a teacher played that for us once it's me. Especially like when you hear like what happened. I mean yeah for his assassination. Yeah. And so by healing him he predicts it.

Speaker 25:         01:52:58       Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Speaker 19:         01:53:00       Well he knew it was coming. I mean it was an incredible time man. Unbelievable. Well not just incredibly written and incredibly performed. And while we're watching it I was like There's no one like this anymore where where's this guy. Where's this guy that represents the black community. A guy who is making like these incredible points and is saying something that's so moving and then you look in the audience and it's so mixed is why people next to black people and such an incredible time in our in our culture where people realize that there there was these inequalities and there was this this groundswell of movement to try to make the world equal and behind it or the figurehead of it is this incredibly powerful incredibly intelligent guy who's probably the greatest public speakers of all time and an operator Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53:48       Just. Hi I have a dream.

Speaker 19:         01:53:51       And you see him say it and he's just like God damn it just gives you goose bumps and then you see Jesse Jackson he cannot stand a fucking word he says he's mumbling through shit eating shrimp cocktails flying in private jets. He's like this is what's left. This is what's left of these guys. There's no guy like that. You know I.

Speaker 2:          01:54:08       I'm not a fan of Obama. I'm you know I was a fan of Obama the candidate of the idea of Obama. But Obama in office. I'm not I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of most of what he's done. Not a fan of the whole NSA thing is spying on people the use of drones is so many things.

Speaker 3:          01:54:24       It's almost too much to mention but one of the things that makes me so disappointed in him is his lack of anything that he's ever said that's inspirational. The speech that he could have given the speeches that Kennedy gave Kennedy gave some fucking speeches that made you change your idea of what's possible for the future of this country. But I don't get any of that from Obama. I get these.

Speaker 4:          01:54:48       No he will but it's funny because being a performer is really I mean like being a performer is what launched him to where he is. Sure. Exactly. Yeah it's because that speech at the convention.

Speaker 19:         01:54:58       Oh yeah. Well yeah. That and just the idea of who he was. I mean we were coming from.

Speaker 4:          01:55:02       Yeah. Yeah an amazing narrative you know about the but one of the earliest criticisms was its performances. Yeah. Well I mean. But all speeches are made their performances. It's hard not like when you go look like if you look like Hitler giving a speech. It's hard not even fathom how I would ever be that he's not as a loon. I mean you look. How would it not be. It's like transparently lunatic. By the time it was like he would give these amazing performances that would get people stirred up and you know it's hard to grasp the context of Hitler because I don't speak German.

Speaker 12:         01:55:31       If I spoke German maybe I could understand like all like all the maniacal everything he does. What does that. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:55:38       It's so intense and so crazy but the the the Obama speeches like there's like there's nothing like oh can we back up please don't think I was doing the ole like Hitler Obama thing.

Speaker 17:         01:55:53       No I didn't think you were doing that. I just thought maybe you're not powerful or no yeah no maybe nervous something I don't.

Speaker 1:          01:55:59       Yeah that's a touchy subject right.

Speaker 19:         01:56:00       You know you you're a Nazi. STEPHEN LINNELL a Nazi the front cover of whatever magazine. Yeah I think we have a serious lack of these powerful inspirational characters these people that that go on TV and or give speeches would they really like her vision to them. Yeah. I mean Obama had some of that as a candidate but as a president it's almost like he looks so tired when I see him on TV. He looks so goddamn tired and I remember when he was running like we had Bush and Cheney we're at war and we're in a war that most people didn't support and was very confusing and it was coming out that the pretense of this war was incorrect and there wasn't really any weapons of mass destruction and all these all those lives and devastation and people were looking into Halliburton and that connection that Cheney felt evil it felt like we were we were trapped with these evil old white dudes. And here comes along this guy who's you know single mother who comes from single mother and he's half black and he's so intelligent so well so well read and so so well-spoken and we thought this was going to be the change this is gonna be the big shift. Yeah. And it didn't turn out to be that at all. It turned out to be just kind of more of the same.

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       But no no more inspiration all that inspiration shit's gone. I mean he's so vibrant as a candidate and as a president I can't remember a single time that he's ever like addressed the nation where I was like that's a bad motherfucker. Like there's there's something there. Oh yeah. He's saying something that really gets people excited.

Speaker 4:          01:57:32       It's been you know it's been so divisive but I always think like when I look at things that look like things that happened. There's a there's things that happens to candidates you know I think that it has so much to do with money like we get these figures you know going into the primaries you get you know you get these figures that have these you know they bucked the trends and Mavericks might say marriage I'm not like Trent I'm not referring strictly to McCain you get these people that come in and they're gonna like upset the status quo then you have to play the politics game and you all so much stuff for money and then you pay those debts and it's like corrupting.

Speaker 10:         01:58:05       And I think a similar thing happens that people often in office I think that like I can't imagine what it must be to be president I say and I say this time out George W. Bush and Obama can't Maduro's be when you present and someone comes in every morning and runs through the list of threats and you hear it and hear it and hear it and it's like threats threats threats threats I the paranoia that must exist you know. I think it has to be really taxing on people. No doubt. And every decision you make. And it's like it's like yeah it's going to be it will be your legacy and you're like and it's gonna be wrenching to just have to make those decisions all time. They look I mean guys come on office looking so rough.

Speaker 4:          01:58:53       Yeah it's probably no one. You never have a guy do one term real popular. He's like You know what. Fuck this I'm not doing it. Yeah there's something like It's so intoxicating to be president.

Speaker 14:         01:59:06       Do you think that's it. I think they probably don't let him you know he probably has a look man.

Speaker 12:         01:59:10       We have a fucking deal that we got we got you into this mess. What are we funny though.

Speaker 4:          01:59:15       Well since George Washington they say he could've won again and he left. He only had one term. No but he was gonna. People were like do three. They want him. They wanted to keep rolling.

Speaker 12:         01:59:26       And he stepped down and I think he might have been the last guy that wouldn't been like well take another one. Bloomberg took out.

Speaker 14:         01:59:32       Jimmy Carter's one of the few guys that was President. I would really love to sit down with and have a private conversation because he seems to be like a true humanitarian and he seems to be at all the people that wherever ever president. The guy who caused probably the least amount of loss of lives in the least amount of war and heartbreak seems to be Jimmy Carter. Yeah. He seemed like a truly like a kind man who wound up in this weird situation where he was the president United States and he's like he wound up in a weird situation out in the desert oh the hostage situation yeah. Oh well that's a crazy situation where the fucking hostages were released as soon as Reagan got into office. Mike what kind of fucking weird deal did you guys make. Did you guys keep those people hostage for for political gain.

Speaker 14:         02:00:16       That's one of the most disgusting possibilities in the history of power in the presidency. That doesn't make any sense. But you know. You know to me it's like the idea that that's a possibility that they might have kept those people and use them as a political ploy is pretty pretty gross. That's bad but probably did happen. I don't know man. Like you said Who the fuck knows what it's like once you get into office who who has any idea. I just don't think there should be a president. I think the idea of having this one alpha chimp running the whole show is so fucking archaic it probably works and was 50 of us. What you want to go Parliament. I don't know what I want to go. I want to go Internet.

Speaker 8:          02:00:55       I think I think we need to go be like this to be like those shows where people vote from home. Like every issue is always about this thing. It's like everyday homes cars voting on every issue son of the president. The president should attack not as well.

Speaker 14:         02:01:10       I just think the idea of having one person or a figurehead that pretends to be the one person that runs the show is just so archaic.

Speaker 8:          02:01:17       Well yeah but we have a system of checks and balances man allegedly.

Speaker 4:          02:01:23       If you look if you if you look at the wild vacillation that some countries go through OK then as well I mean you rattle them off all day long. People get frustrated with how slowly things happen in the U.S.. That's the. That's the story the gridlock nothing gets done it's all idiots. If you look at the gradual way one might argue that all that gridlock and all that mayhem and things being so stagnant somehow works to our benefit from it like from preventing wild swings both is this lower that right. You know we get like you know we're like a really serious communist that we go from that to a real serious anarchist then we realize that doesn't work. We go to a you know some wild as dictator I feel that kind of like just kind of these mild undulations when taken when you view it from a historic perspective I think these mild undulations that we go through in politics are to our benefit. I'm like I'm a little bit pro gridlock. That's interesting because just if it was just like so fast I feel like we'd makes we have more stumbles than we have I think. But I'm kind of like generally like an optimist you know I'm a general optimist too.

Speaker 2:          02:02:40       I just think there's too many people. I think there's too many people too many interests too much money too much too many different directions to the money things really should go like this.

Speaker 4:          02:02:49       This dude just got the mayor in New York I want to go back to my show business story to at some point. No one tell me Mitch Hedberg story book. And I want to talk about hunting pigs mow how we had time. We're fine. OK. So last month. Oh yeah. So the guy is the guy who's got elected mayor in New York. I mean he's on an hour a day and he's like OK no more we don't have any more horses pulling carriages around in Central Park. Really. Yeah. Right off the bat it's like are you tell me you're now running the biggest city the one that like terror is drool about you know the one that's like like balancing all these like ethnic groups and tensions and the one thing that's on your mind when you come in is that horses are pulling carriages in Central Park and is mean.

Speaker 12:         02:03:40       How could that pass.

Speaker 4:          02:03:41       It has to be some dude wrote that guy check you know and he's like here's the deal I'm gonna give you this check but I don't want him damn horses in that park because there's no other way to explain it. It's like it shows candidates like weird ignorance and arrogance where if you talk to him who's involved in livestock theft and livestock issues we have like. We don't have a horse thief. We don't have a not enough horse problem we have it. There's too many horses like there's no since the closure horse slaughter plants. There's like people are dumping horses people farmers will wake up and be like wow there's a bunch of horses out of my place because there's just no way to get rid of excess horses you have all these horses that are unwanted horses that are starving horses that are being treated properly and you've got these like gainfully employed horses that are fed stabled care for veterinarian treatment and the guy would be like the one thing we need is unemployed horses.

Speaker 8:          02:04:33       It has to be about some weird money thing or it could be he's just a bleeding heart liberal. Now it doesn't look at it. You think so you think it's just a money thing. I mean I don't know. I can't see what the fuck happened with a large drink thing. How did that ever take place. That was Bloomberg. Yeah but it wound up not happening. Did it really. Thank God. That's Riddick. No band never banned big pop.

Speaker 2:          02:04:51       Jesus Christ that drove me nuts. The idea that you couldn't get a big gulp or a giant.

Speaker 18:         02:04:56       I never wanted those mediator.

Speaker 4:          02:04:58       Some computer is doing something he was doing like a thing where he was like you're supposed to complete the sentence like It's so hot you know. Mm hmm. Then one was it's so hot. Bloomberg had to go over to Jersey to get a Big Gulp. Yeah. But the nanny state stuff. I hate it like I hate the like the all the like telling people do not do free health. I hate it. Yeah like I could also picture like how frustrating because you be like Yeah it's like if you look out like a guy who smoked on cigarettes on hand like it's not you know why. Right. You can't go. You've got to be big you've got to be a big enough of a man to walk away and be like OK you know a ride a motorcycle without a helmet. I'm like why then I'd sound like you I'd be like a big enough person in some weird way I'd be like OK you go ahead and push on and I'm gonna try to not want to like control your life.

Speaker 2:          02:05:48       Well there's gonna be people look at you and go Dude. You can't talk about cigarettes or motorcycles you got charged by a fucking moose. Yeah. All right. I saw it.

Speaker 1:          02:05:56       I saw you get hit by a moose. I watched it five times now. That was you describing it was harrowing but watching it was way crazier when that fucking thing got up and started running towards you. Even though I knew you were OK I met you after the fact. I was like Oh he's dead. He's fucking dead.

Speaker 4:          02:06:11       No. We met there we met well before but that's that was you know it. You don't have tv like that was what I did was so stupid. Each one on one hand I did was so dumb when I did not know. I thought I didn't mean it but what it was so stupid that you'd want to then hide how stupid you were and not have it be on TV. Right. They're like but it's compelling TV. Yeah like a guy getting run over by a moose is interesting you know. So it's your thing of like your ego where and now it'll happen. We're calling you know Ryan Kelly.

Speaker 25:         02:06:44       Yeah I love Ryan. Great guy.

Speaker 9:          02:06:47       We were calling moose and when you call moose.

Speaker 34:         02:06:53       That's an excellent picture. Go pinch your nostrils.

Speaker 4:          02:06:58       That's the cow that's a cow saying I am coming into Astros and party calling is a fact. Like Moose Calling is effective right before the run rate for the breeding season because bulls know what's going to happen like the cows are gonna wanna be bred to breed them but the cows have really got rolling yet. So which is all anticipation. If they were actually all doing it and the cows are really an Astros in the bulls like with the cow that's an Astros he's gonna be less likely to come to one calling. You know it's all a timing issue you got to catch him right. Yeah. He wants it. You're the first. He's like there she is first cow to come and just go get her. So we're out. Brian's mimicking the noise of a bull. I'm sorry mimicking the noise of a cow and what inspired and begin doing that as we heard a bowling ball make some noise like this ball will go.

Speaker 9:          02:07:53       So that's all you heard. It's like a soldier you don't even hear it you feel it. It's a suggestion of a noise. It's like I was like What was it. But it's very hard to determine where it was not where it's harder. How far away. And we heard that and then we debated for a long time whether we'd heard it or not. We're like No I know I heard a bull I heard a bull then it actually started to thunder a little bit off in the distance which made it even more confusing. It was like Was it thunder or was it that you know noise. So Ryan starts trying to lure the bull to us. This is on British Columbia. He starts trying to lure the bull to us by roaming around making cow calls and he goes away from the bull and I stay put.

Speaker 10:         02:08:35       Hoping that the bull will come and he's gonna want to see her before he gets too close. So by Ryan staying about 75 yards further away the bull might hang up in the vicinity of where I'm at. You know while he's trying to get a visual lock on the cow to make sure everything looks safe and we keep calling corn and then I'm starting I was going crazy I never heard the bull in the first place so we start going in the direction eventually start moving in the direction where we think the bull is and sure enough I see some brush clashing and he's in there rubbing his antlers on some brush and Ryan starts calm and now we're in his zone enough where he's coming to investigate and he's coming in and he kind of comes at me and I do like a really stupid thing where I take what you call a brisket shot and a brisket shot a deer wild pig is devastating.

Speaker 13:         02:09:21       You you're coming in like the sternum and you know it is devastating to the animal a small animal but I'm just so much.

Speaker 20:         02:09:30       No it's like like layers of bricks and stuff like basically at the front of made. And he goes down and I go running over there. And sure enough he gets up and starts running and I'm worried like the last thing I do is chase a moose but I'm worried that maybe he's not bleeding enough. So I start running after him and I get up there and he's I catch up to when he's laying down again and I go to shoot him in the neck and click like I had messed up my rifle and hadn't chambered around. So it clicks and that bull got up and just turn in like came and boom knocked me over like coming at you like you know head down horns down like a bull you know head down horns.

Speaker 4:          02:10:15       And he punched me in the ass of one of his antler times and I thought it punctured me. So I ran away and Callahan shoots the moose down and I keep reaching around to feel where he had popped me so hard in the ass and knocked me over. And my hankies come back bloody. So I'm trying to feel where he put a hole in me and I'm thinking like he'd like punched a hole through my waders and into my into my arms tissue. And then I realized that like I got blood all over it cause he had I'd hit him in the brisket so when he ran me over he like smeared a lot of that blood on the back of my clothes. So that was the blood I was feeling scared to help me. And you saw that was a few days before I got charged by grizzly bear. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:11:00       It was a harrowing trip. Hey you're talking about people smoking cigarettes and riding motorcycles with no helmets.

Speaker 9:          02:11:05       That moose deal was probably the closest. You know like you fantasize about bad stuff happen to you from big animals you know like you can get mauled by bear or whatever. And what really gets his little teeth things like I like my hospital stuff has been you know like serious issues Ben Giardina so drinking bad water and Lyme disease by getting you know bit by little teeny bugs that are infected with bacteria and that's like my real source of trouble.

Speaker 4:          02:11:34       But when I'm laying in bed and then I'm not thinking about microbes I'm thinking about big giant animals coming to get me in on that one came and knocked me in the minute but it's like it's mixed emotions this was happening like that was the stupidest thing I ever did I can't believe that I'm so dumb. And then and concurrent with that as a thought of like I am so happy that that happened. That was an amazing thing you know.

Speaker 12:         02:11:56       And now it is stupid as it was down there and I'm like I love that that happened because you're OK.

Speaker 11:         02:12:02       Yeah yeah. It's actually mortifying. Looking at it now I wouldn't even be disappointed had he punched a hole in my butt as long as you live. Yeah but what if he hit your sack. Would have a horn. I mean think about that.

Speaker 8:          02:12:15       I already got two kids. You're cool with a hole in the sack from what I can tell. Have two days. My wife is like go down and get a vasectomy half days. She's like No way. It's more one on one. I just mean you know what David is the dead issue now moves. Across my who was killed by my Zach. I'm a eunuch. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:12:34       They'll be harsh. It was fun man. I mean I love that like you know you'll appreciate this because I was reading this book about human history called Lone Survivor not Lone Survivor. That's the seal story. Yeah it's somebody lone survivors. It's by a geneticist a British geneticist. And it was something like that sole survivors.

Speaker 10:         02:12:59       He talks about the suite of injuries that are common to Neanderthal skeletons. I told you about this. So like everyone they dig up Neanderthal Skelton in the miles of caves and stuff like one you find that they've been cut like their bone they've been butchered so that they die and their bodies would presumably their bodies are chromatic. And we've had a tendency to go eat them and they also find all these like fractured bones like busted bones fractured skulls fractured vertebra Lone Survivor yeah yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:13:27       And in some ways in this book and these guys kind of got warning like why do they have this type of injury and eventually some doctor looks at the like the injuries that are common in Neanderthals and he says you know I see that as rodeo riders and it's like the things that happen to people who are like mixing it up with big critters. And the theory that this guy puts forward not not Sykes not the guy that wrote it was to pull it up again. What is the name again. Christian. Yeah. So Chris I don't think Chris Stringer fault said. He talks about a guy who floats this idea that they had a confrontational hunting style that Neanderthals did today were in there you know tearing it up and Cro Magnum has had a little bit more of a stay back.

Speaker 2:          02:14:17       You know stay back and get them a better time when the other tools are way closer to the rest of the animals than than we are.

Speaker 4:          02:14:25       I mean they had they were five feet tall 200 plus pounds big thick fuckin bones no one else's is that they didn't have a lot of sexual dysmorphia the males and females are much more similar. Really. Probably he met females were in there hunting more probably had to be positive that they weren't just structurally the females or similar. And so having that little run in with that moose was kind of I felt like a little bit in a positive way I felt a little bit like maybe like there was like a Neanderthal experience with the Neanderthal thing is weird man because they find out like all these things that biggest thing they didn't do was like evidence that they that once they came into contact with Cro Magnum it was like they started picking up some of the things that they were Indu like there's evidence to suggest that like at that they had been around for you know hundreds thousand years and also in dudes show up but we show up and also they kind of got interested in decoration a little bit I got interested in art a little bit. Music theory you know that they had see they were somehow interacting with us some were kind of like stealing our make sense stealing our groove a little bit.

Speaker 14:         02:15:29       Well I mean you think about all the things that we use guns computers this table we didn't build in a shit.

Speaker 26:         02:15:36       Oh yeah yeah we figured it out from other really smart human.

Speaker 4:          02:15:38       Yeah you dad. And so they were kind of like came into somehow. It was going on and there was some internal aggression. He talks a lot about that in that book that there was there were he argues a little bit argue that isn't the case that the argument there is that there was certainly some intro aggression.

Speaker 2:          02:15:54       Yeah I've heard that and I've also heard that it's it's confusion and that would it really is is common ancestor.

Speaker 4:          02:16:01       Yeah. Know I've heard all. So I'm not I'm not like I'm not definitely I'm. You know when it comes to that kind of stuff I'm not the guy let you do the same like I'm saying what some people say right. You know I mean some people say that it's an interesting idea and lots of changes so fast. I always hate to be like well this is what it was you know.

Speaker 2:          02:16:19       But you talking about you know what.

Speaker 17:         02:16:20       What is the most recent version of Neanderthals one hundred thousand years I mean when they when they went out thirty thirty thirty thirty five thirty thirty. Could anybody know what the hell exactly happened thirty five thousand years ago it's too it's too far. He explains how he explains what they know so far. Well yeah.

Speaker 10:         02:16:36       He explains how the people that have an opinion on it came to form their opinion.

Speaker 2:          02:16:40       That makes sense you know. Yeah but for sure I look I know men and I know that if men live at the end of thoughts somebody would affect.

Speaker 4:          02:16:49       Oh yeah I know dudes. Yeah they would do it even if it was sort of like an act of aggression like you look at conquering forces you know. Yeah. On one hand they're coming into Congress because they despise them.

Speaker 10:         02:17:00       But like dudes conquering dudes will often find themselves you know like history's full those examples where a conquering army that's coming out to get like the worst people on the planet all they want to do is annihilate them.

Speaker 8:          02:17:11       But they also kind of have sex at. Did you ever see there's one.

Speaker 2:          02:17:16       I think there's an Australian anthropologist very fringe guy but he had this really funny take on Neanderthals that they were the super predators and that we we hunted them and do extinction. Yeah. Because he knows is that they didn't look like people at all.

Speaker 4:          02:17:31       They look like gorillas that Cro Magnum hunted them. Yes. Yes. Did you ever see that. No. But but I've I don't know if I've seen that guy's ideas but seeing the idea that that's the case and what people point to is that they always find butcher marks. Not always but it's very common to find butcher marks on those bones and also find what to crack the heads open and presumably get the brain out.

Speaker 2:          02:17:52       Yeah. I wish I could remember killing Neanderthals.

Speaker 4:          02:17:55       I forget what the id be like if you shot a Yeti now or not a Yeti if you shot Sasquatch. People be pissed. Oh yeah. You know. Yeah but I bet you that crow mangling the Neanderthal weren't is different. There might not have been as many differences between those two as there would be between us and a Sasquatch if you haven't run into one hole up them in us.

Speaker 2:          02:18:16       Pull up some images the books called them and us and his proposal was the eye sockets were much larger the features more simian the bone structure is much closer to lower primates than ours and we're just assuming we anthropomorphize these animals and assume they had white skin legs and hair like us. But he gives them like black skin like a gorilla and you know decides that they were these really intelligent predators that hunted us down.

Speaker 19:         02:18:44       We widely discredited. Yeah but it's this is look at this the images.

Speaker 4:          02:18:50       Well that's what you think they look like. Yeah that looks like something you'd have in your studio.

Speaker 11:         02:18:54       Yeah exactly. Yeah like a yeti or something. This is his crazy idea. I mean most likely horseshit but really kind of fastening Von horseshit though. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:19:04       We don't have a soft tissue from these fucking guys. We don't really know what the hell was going on. We don't have their skin. We can't compare the color and texture. We don't really know.

Speaker 4:          02:19:12       I think the picture will become more clearer eventually. I mean because they get such sophisticated ways looking at stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:19:18       Well there was that one misinterpreted idea that I think a Harvard geneticist was saying that one day could be possible and there may be an ethical consideration that we would have to ask a woman if she'd be willing to give birth in Neanderthal baby. And then it became you know distributed Harvard geneticist wants women to give birth to Neanderthal looking for volunteers and like taking place in the aerosol baby in your body like you know not it's not exact what they're saying but like this is what you would get so many women that would do it.

Speaker 8:          02:19:48       Fuck yeah for sure.

Speaker 2:          02:19:50       Just to become famous. Look at that they would they think that things might look like well sugar packet that there's some footage of one. Yeah. Well the idea is that you know we we think that they looked like people but he kind of goes out the way of giving a real sinister appearance.

Speaker 25:         02:20:04       We'll look at the bone structure the differences in the bone structure not thicker and yeah he makes them look like monsters in a movie with little tiny dicks. Interesting. How can they have little dicks. I would think that thing would have a giant dick whatever. While we're thinking about Neanderthal dicks coming tell me about tell me about your need for Mitch Hedberg story.

Speaker 4:          02:20:24       You know one thing about try out real quick is not the great story but I had this girlfriend who had this fellowship she got in San Jose California and saw I was back for Team Montana and saying sales a whole time and there's always this marquee about this comedy house. Oh you told me the story. I didn't think you told on the podcast. Good. There's this marquee about the comedy house and he kept saying like Mitch Hedberg you know March or Mitch Hedberg whatever it is always in the back of my head like may I go get my ticket got to get my ticket. And then one day I says like we'll miss you Mitch. I'm like Son of a bitch I thought it was coming up you know. And I thought I like that it mentally. He came and performed and went home. You know and I ran to the window be like Why do you guys have it on your marquee that is coming in March when he's when he's already and she said no. He died this morning. It's kind of a weird I agree it's not a great story. It does. It feels it feels that way to me.

Speaker 25:         02:21:14       There's the thing right there that was all over the country.

Speaker 17:         02:21:18       Well it was those. Yeah they did those everywhere they did though.

Speaker 25:         02:21:20       I think they did one at the Laugh Factory the marquee at the Laugh Factory as well.

Speaker 17:         02:21:25       Now Amanda was funny for my all time favorites and clean to clean comedienne if I know. Yeah he. Have you gone on listen to the comedian good storyteller Jerry clown that I'm always asking you. Yeah. Yeah I did. I've listened to you know like it. It's funny. It's all about putting it in the context. He's a funny guy.

Speaker 4:          02:21:41       Yeah. Knowing the context. Otherwise. Oh I thought that just because had mid-February like you could actually listen to Mitch Hedberg with your kid and your grandma.

Speaker 19:         02:21:49       Yeah yeah. He swears in the last one the most most recent one he does. Says a few quite a few fucks.

Speaker 4:          02:21:54       Yeah I mean does that good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's using them you know Stoner is stoner humor.

Speaker 3:          02:21:59       Yeah he's. He was a brilliant guy who really unique comedian but too to bring it all around.

Speaker 8:          02:22:05       I want you to bring it I want you bring around the pigs.

Speaker 3:          02:22:08       Well that's what we're doing this weekend and I'm fired up like I told you I shot 30 rounds today 60 yesterday and then 300 fucking arrows the day before as my right arm is so useless right now. My I can't remember the last time my right shoulder was a sore.

Speaker 4:          02:22:24       It's good that you're shooting them. I miss a lot of shooting. Yeah. Ms Nottle is not alone. She never like guys are really into shooting with a lot of shooting for a 3. Good to. No. I mean to like to get that level of proficiency coming just from repetition. Yeah. Learn how to do stuff through repetition.

Speaker 2:          02:22:38       I'm not you know I'm a big believer in preparation. I don't believe and I like one of the things that I learned when I was young when I was competing mouse fighting when I wasn't in that good shape I was really fucking nervous. I was in really good shape and I was really well trained. My nerves were considerably less Yeah and I think that that's with everything. Yeah you gotta be fully prepared.

Speaker 4:          02:23:00       So yeah. Guys I know like the guys and all the best hunting that I somewhat you go out and you have to. It has to be you know you're going to you know. Mm hmm. Cause if things get hard and things get bad and things are going your way. If you've already been going into like you didn't know what was going to happen. It allows you to more quickly jump into that it didn't happen right. Like if you go under like it has to happen it will happen. Has that. Then when things are like sucky you you still pursuing that narrative. You know what will happen when we were in Montana.

Speaker 2:          02:23:29       You kept saying We're gonna get one. You kept saying that. Yeah we're gonna get it here. You keep saying that we're gonna get there.

Speaker 4:          02:23:35       Like you said that many times I feel like what what we're doing this weekend isn't gonna be you know like hunting wild pigs. I mean there's gonna there's gonna be obviously a lot of pigs. I mean there's this place T.A. John to HoN t e t o n Jahan ranch. Yeah I think has it. I gather they have like quite a bit of a pig population enough to the point where you know people go out there and go out there and like you know do a guided pig on. They do this throughout the year. So if there were none there wouldn't be that way. Right. And oftentimes when I've hunted pigs I've found that you know it is like there's so much more for and you know like a deer go on a deer never use that word in my life. What is that word mean for kind. They have a lot of babies. So I could take a look at another animal native animal around here and be like you know black tailed does have to do with the premise.

Speaker 19:         02:24:32       Fuck it start with fucking the kind of comedy kind of VCU and.

Speaker 4:          02:24:37       So like for comedy is good at making babies. Yeah it seems like and the rude as fuck dear someone's line you know and have one or two a year right. That pig's gonna a female pigs and keep kicking off litters of you know six 10 several times a year. What a powerful animal too. If they're I mean they're really they're really smart.

Speaker 20:         02:25:01       I mean they've gotten they've through our you know through them trying to put together an idea it's not actually that complicated thanks to us. And in spite of us at the same time they've managed to get everywhere.

Speaker 4:          02:25:19       You know like oftentimes we just do it like we thought was a good idea for a long time. You go put pigs everywhere. Now we're like maybe it wasn't such a good idea to put pigs everywhere and and you know there's not a lot we're doing to stop them. That's not the case here. Like in California they treated more like a game animal. You know the number like when people travel more people travel to California to hunt wild pigs and anything else really.

Speaker 10:         02:25:41       And they just don't seem to really cause the level of damage and hysteria that they do in some other areas like it like in you know certain areas in the southeast and the Gulf Coast area. I mean there's pigs the point where it just is really hard on agricultural interests and it's kind of inexplicable how they seem to be there for so long and explode into some level. But in California just bend and just bend there's some pigs around and people generally appreciate them.

Speaker 4:          02:26:10       I used to hunt pigs at night used to. I still do. But I have a friend who's got some. Her family has some cattle ranches up around Sacramento and he's kind of got this little bit like yeah. You know sometimes I get too many and I need to get rid of some but then we'll get a dry year and they'll all go away anyway and I'd like it if you went out and shot some if you see one shoot one for me and they kind of are causing me a little bit of problems. And you can tell it has its conflicted relationship. But I put it to him one day I said Glenn if you could shake a magic wand and all the wild pigs would be gone would you shake it. No you know so he even admitted like they're a hassle. He doesn't want a lot of them around.

Speaker 4:          02:26:51       But he would never want to see them all gone. You know and it feels kind of like the relay. It's a great general. It's a huge generalization. I feel like that's kind of been the relationship is a lot of hunters. I get all kinds of e-mails from guys live in California and they're like they went out pig hunting six times everyone saw a pig you know hunting on public ground and these guys I wish there was more of them in and in other parts of the country. You got government agencies paying real money to try to wipe them out because they caused such a problem with native species and agricultural interests and you know. But here it's just a it's a different vibe in California.

Speaker 3:          02:27:27       Have you seen the pig man Ted Nugent footage.

Speaker 4:          02:27:31       I've seen clips of it I haven't seen it. I mean I know everything I know so much about. I mean I have shown that network you know.

Speaker 2:          02:27:36       Yeah. They shoot for folks or just listen and not know what we're talking about. They have pig man has a couple of episodes called a pork lips. You know where they shoot pigs out a helicopters. Lots of them. He shot one with a bow and arrow out of a helicopter. Did he kill it.

Speaker 4:          02:27:50       Yeah I saw that. Yeah. I mean I I knew that it happened I know. I didn't know it came to be that he got it and got it.

Speaker 3:          02:27:56       We had to aim way high because the the downdraft of the blade shove an arrow to have the arrow down so I had to judge it.

Speaker 10:         02:28:03       Know I heard recently I heard that they're in the situation learned to be like paying people by the hour to kill pigs.

Speaker 2:          02:28:11       Yeah I would imagine. I mean they have millions of pigs in Texas apparently. Well they have a lot of farmland in Texas too.

Speaker 4:          02:28:19       But they're it's it's a weird thing about it. The endangers like not the endangered species. A weird thing about stuff like pigs and how you know just so I don't.

Speaker 10:         02:28:32       I'm sure your viewers if someone up to speed on this. But wild pigs are not from North we don't have wild pigs are not native to North America. People brought wild pigs to North America. Early on in the pioneer days or during the current years contact years they brought pigs to North America from their native and your Asia brought them here as a food source and they would keep some in pens and other people would have a practice where you go into an area and you just kind of turn pigs out they wouldn't scatter too far they'd fatten themselves on acorns and masked and grubs and various things. And when you want and when you could take your rifle out and find a couple and shoot them it was a way to to produce meat where it wasn't you weren't needing to provide it with all of its feed.

Speaker 10:         02:29:15       It's a very sturdy animal that could fatten itself on land. And inevitably these pigs would get away. So we've had wild pigs here about as long as we have to have had Europeans here another version happened later where people brought them in as a game species and when they would bring them into the game species they would bring them in from you know like Siberia and other areas where you still had the original stock. So the original Sioux scrap it was like what we call the Eurasian wild boar they had been bringing in domestic versions that had been bred off the Arabian wild boar and then people brought directly in the wild boar. Now if you look for a parallel with cattle like the ancestral cattle Zain and we now call the oryx but the oryx went extinct. So we lost the wild version but retained the domestic version with pigs we had the domestic version that we humans created over long long. Tens of thousands years coexisting with the wild version. So people brought wild ones in Boston in New Hampshire in the late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds. They brought them to California.

Speaker 4:          02:30:18       Around that time and kind of put them out on the land as a thing to hunt and in time we now have populations that are of domestic stock. We have populations that are Eurasian stocks so they look like a real souped up European wild boar. And we have populations that are various hybrids. They demonstrate different degrees of it and they've been around a long time and in some areas there's way too many. The trouble with some like that one troublesome thing that hams mean against it is complicated as shootin rhinos to save rhinos is it. We've always had we've had over the last you know 150 years we've been developing like this this set of ethics like what's an acceptable what are acceptable practices to use when hunting.

Speaker 9:          02:31:03       And we made a general determination that certain things aren't acceptable like you know we don't Jack like deer like you can't use spotlights to go out and shoot deer at night. We've built up these rules because we have ideas about what's sporting what what's the elements of fair chase also what leads to too much harvest. So if you make it too easy to go get animals then you're going to have shorter seasons you're going to have fewer available tags you know. And so they kind of balanced technology to sort of make it that you're going to have whatever success rate like a lot of outcomes. Only 10 percent of the hunters that participate in the election are successful 90 percent are unsuccessful because we have rules in place that make it difficult to do to hunt there's so many pigs now. In some places that we're like discarding a lot of that we have to do in dealing with that species we're discarding a lot of the notions that we've held dear like you would never go out in a helicopter and shoot deer it would never be legal it would be frowned on by everybody in the hunting community.

Speaker 9:          02:32:05       But with pigs it's like an exception because it's a non-native animal that we want to get rid of.

Speaker 10:         02:32:09       And so it really is like it becomes kind of a cloudy issue like when we're doing these like big game hunting practices that we worked hard to get rid of in order to save North American wildlife from the pits where we had driven it in the early 90s hundreds and now like all these like ethical practices are not really applicable to this animal. So you see some things in season things happen like your initial reaction is like Oh man it's just like ugly you know it's ugly but the like but it's a really complicated situation. There's a ton of pigs causing a ton of economic damage and it's really putting a hurt on people and it's putting a hurt on native species to you know like we lose like Hawaii lost ground nesting birds many species of wild ground nesting birds because of pigs and rats.

Speaker 10:         02:32:56       Introduce species. Eat the eggs. Yeah. Pigs are really hard. There is like you know rare bird preserves in Florida where the number one problem to have those preserves is pigs eat all their eggs because these are ground nesting birds and pigs just vacuum them up. So you bring like kind of these like practices that strike someone who grew up in the in the American hunting tradition and it's like oh man you know I've even engage in some things like I've done to pigs I've done things that wild pigs that I wouldn't do to any other animal like what. I mean like running you know running the dogs and Coleman knives and digging them out of holes and chasing them in a little fenced enclosures and kill them in there and you know it's like it's their legitimate honest problem.

Speaker 2:          02:33:40       Well you're your last show that I watched last night actually. You had a pig. It was a whole head to hoof pig cooking wild pig cooking special was really fun special. Very interesting yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:33:53       Very educational I heard a story of that pig. Yeah the pig had his balls removed.

Speaker 10:         02:33:57       Yeah. So this is crazy I'd gone down to Florida hunting turkeys and we have the American there's like but multiple subspecies of the American Turkey. So we have it's all one species but there's subspecies or varieties you have like the Eastern Wild Turkey and most of the east the Osceola Turkey which was in the south half of the Florida Peninsula. Then you have the Rio Grande Turkey Miriam's Turkey the ghouls Turkey and northern Mexico southern Arizona. And if you're like a turkey geek you might want to try to eventually get all have the experience of hunting all Turkey subspecies I kind of accidentally got four of them and I realized that I want to go to South Florida and have a chance to hunt as the oldest.

Speaker 4:          02:34:37       So I went on the hunt seals down the swamps donor and we're down there running these guys who hunt pigs with hounds what they're set up is this guy has big cattle ranch and it borders a rare bird preserve and the preserve. You can't even walk around and it's close. Most of the preserve is closed any human visitation at all. Cane. Take a walk through there but they have guys like full time pig hunting here.

Speaker 10:         02:35:02       He goes around and kills pigs as a way to try to protect these rare bird species to give them nesting opportunities. The rancher who likes to hunt wild hogs goes and he usually kind of hunts along his border with the preserve because the pigs will come out of the swamps and the preserve and come up and hunt on his route around on his land in the cover of night and then retreat back into the preserve where they're relatively safe and hide out.

Speaker 4:          02:35:28       So what he realized is he went through and put this fence in and put trap doors one way doors in his fence so that pigs could leave the preserve and enter his fence. But then they couldn't get back out. It was like it was like a fish trap door. So now and then if he gets the itch and to go pig hunting he'll go out at four in the morning and make sure all the doors are shut like closes the door is up so the pigs can't get back through the other way. And then he knows they're probably somewhere on his ranch. And when he starts chasing when his hounds they won't be able to make it back into their safety in the preserve. And when he goes out if he gets a boar like an old boar Scott is not intact. He knows it's not going to be a great eating board because they just they run themselves right. You know they're not like they don't have a lot of fat. They're full of hormones. They're not at they're certainly edible but not as good eating. So what he'll do is he'll do something that benefits everyone. He will castrate that hard and turn it out because now that hog cannot contribute to the population he's not a viable breeding member of the population.

Speaker 23:         02:36:33       And if he catches them again he'll have what's called a barred hog barrel. What was that word bear.

Speaker 4:          02:36:42       Bart Hogg which is a castrated hog. So like a steers a castrated you know steers a castrated male cow castrate a bull in a bar dog is castrated. So we went on one eye and caught a big board was not intact castrated him and turned him out so he could as this guy put it it would take his mind off ass and put on the grass and then we stayed out caught another pig. And this one had at some point in time they didn't know if they had it or another guy had done this one had been castrated. You need to known as totally healed up. But he had me castrated those guys like that'll be a good one to eat. So we kill that hog and kept it for food and we ate that thing from from honest to God. We ate it skin as pork rinds took its intestines out and flushed the intestines and stripped and made our own sausage casings liver heart it is nose in head cheese eight feet by eight every part of that hard.

Speaker 8:          02:37:43       Yeah. The guy actually is the one thing I got left is one of the good parts. I got one back leg frozen. I want him in my freezer. I didn't know what head cheese was. I didn't narrow hall.

Speaker 35:         02:37:53       That's the word I'm good arrow Beryl Beryl.

Speaker 17:         02:37:56       Well let's look it up here. Please read it hard. I've even written the word I wrote a thing about this. What is a castrated pig called Bard barrel bear hug.

Speaker 35:         02:38:12       Be a r r o w Barrow hog Barrow hog.

Speaker 25:         02:38:16       Hmm hmm. Colonel Barrow Yeah. B or w.

Speaker 4:          02:38:21       Yeah. These guys love to hunt. They love to eat pigs. D It's a good little system they got the head cheese was so weird.

Speaker 19:         02:38:28       I never I'd heard that name before word description. I didn't know what it was. It's like a gelatin.

Speaker 4:          02:38:34       You know I made head cheese with the first the first wild pig I ever was in California. I went out to hunt wild pigs and I had never laid eyes on a wild pig and I don't want to shoot the first wild pig I saw. So I went out one day without my rifle just to see some wild pigs. And the next day I went out and got one. I want to make head cheese with it where it's not. It doesn't make it cheese was like gelatinous so a lot of the cuts.

Speaker 10:         02:38:57       Like when you put your name a lot of the cuts that are too weird you know that don't really make great steak. They're not that way. They have a lot of connective tissue you know and fatty deposit levels have something like terms in the college and when you cook it like it turns in like a gelatin when you cook it. So a head's full that stuff in the bones have it. And so you simmer that head for a long long time. Eventually can pick off all meat and a lot of the gristle and connective tissue and stuff turns into like a gelatin like substance you can make real gelatin that way. And now we just have a packet reporter powder mix of the water makes gelatin but old style gelatin and natural gelatin would be just derived from as an animal byproduct. So you take all the meat you pluck off the same way like hog job well if you ever had that you take the tongue out and chop the tongue up. There's all this other at Roo. At when it's warm it's liquid but it sets up as gelatin and it's just all bound together with natural gelatin that you've derived by slow cooking the pig's head. So it's like little bits of pig meat bound up in an aspic are bound up in gelatin and of course you season it and flavour it with all kinds of good stuff to eat.

Speaker 4:          02:40:04       And then when you when you when it when it sets up when it's chilled you can pour it out like it looks almost like a fruitcake. You know it pours out in a mould and then you slice it and it's not cheese. It looked great. It looked great because my body does it. Yeah my body that makes it this guy Matt Weingarten a chef I hang out with.

Speaker 10:         02:40:24       He puts all his amazing stuff in there and he puts you know you can put like colorful things and citrus he flavours and it's beautiful.

Speaker 2:          02:40:32       One of the things I really love about your show is that they occasionally do show like recipes and how to cook but also that you butcher the animals that you cut quarter the animals got them. You do all that on the show.

Speaker 4:          02:40:42       You don't see why you see whales up on the show that you don't see on other stuff. Now we have a trip. It's like it's amazing how much liberty like how much liberty we have like how much the network lets us get away with is it because it's on the Sportsman Channel because you can. Yeah there's another there's a there's another channel that shows on shows they won't let the people have bloody hands. What show is that. My understanding is not a show there's there's a network I've heard that that. Yeah there is another hunting network. I've heard it it's protocol on other hunting networks you're not supposed to have bloody hands like you won't see him got animals. That's ridiculous because they think that to make people turned off by hunting is like how you think people get turned off by hunting by seeing people eat what they hunt is beyond me. But sportsman channel is really cool because they let us do stuff. I mean in it it works the advantage is people like you know what. I get it man. You know it's like you're showing like a thing that most people are hiding from but it's the reality that meat goes through a metamorphosis you know to get there and then it's sometimes gory so yeah we get to show all that. And I love it but I don't think of it as just like gratuitous. No it's like it's instructional really.

Speaker 2:          02:41:49       Yes yeah. That's that's how I feel. I don't I don't feel it's gratuitous at all but I think I like watching you like when you eat that mousse. I like watching guys cut it up and then eat it. Now

Speaker 4:          02:42:00       that me it was like on believable man we had that marrow cracked the marrow bones open to working with the marrow on deck and believable like that meat was so tender and good and you know getting the thing realized when you're on TV you know you suppose you know you watch like morning shows and they have a cooking segment. The host is like oh it's so good. Oh it's so good. You know sometimes I cook something so it's not good. And I just try to be like That's not good at karaoke. Yeah. You know it's not that great because I want it to be that when it when something is good I feel like I want you to believe me. And that was good. It was just a phenomenal moves me looked unbelievably delicious Elks widely regarded as like if you went to survey people who've tasted a wide variety meats elk is the one that you would be like it's the best one where we're going. Deon has elk on it Tulio. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         02:42:49       You know you got like Roosevelt elk Rocky Mount all these different subspecies elk is a very rare one in California not rare but yeah rare and a very small range that was almost wiped down. It's back now because you have like big chunks of property like that where they can find you know find some refuge and people are working to maintain them provide habitat forms so it's kind of cool spot you go there and see a elk that most people have seen.

Speaker 4:          02:43:14       I hope I hope we run into one this is like a two the two the elk you know do you feel like the moose was right up there with elk it was I'm not joking. It was one of the best pieces of meat I eat and eat meat in the field. You know we age mix it tenderizer you know and we're eating meat like fresh meat often tastes like art where you eat some fresh meat rich. There's like a onion kind of thing to it. It just doesn't quite taste like age meat. I like that. But when we're Wisconsin man we're you're cooking those steaks and it is phenomenal. Yeah so so but sometimes it's pretty tough. Like my brother Eric my brother my brother lives in Alaska. He kills moose every year. Like the guy that kills moose is moose all year. He's a moose snob but he won't hunt a lot of stuff you like.

Speaker 4:          02:43:53       He likes to hunt moves and all sheep because moose is good but he puts a moose in his freezer because just because he doesn't have a hanging you know he doesn't have a lock or he can dry age his meat. He'll kill a moose and tip because of weather and bugs and other issues. He comes home and right away processes his moose and puts in his freezer and he don't usually touch that thing for six months because it will slowly age like meat will tend to rise in your freezer over time. So when he calculates his a year out he knows he's going to kill a moose in September. He doesn't plan on having the one he killed before be gone in September. He plans on having the one he killed before begone. No it's staggered so the one that he kills he lets it slowly age in his freezer and it will tend to rise in your freezer over time and then he starts in on the new one. So when he kills moose he so eat in the moose from the year before.

Speaker 27:         02:44:41       That seems so weird because you way you eat that moose. It didn't seem like you needed anything at all because it was an exceptional animal. So that's unusual.

Speaker 36:         02:44:49       It's yeah. Those animals like most animals especially males and bowls like most animals not most animals benefit like like undulate benefit from aging.

Speaker 4:          02:45:02       No one age you know age wild pigs you know you don't age black bears a lot of critters you do age deer l moose it all benefits those animals all benefit from aging. There's natural you know there's natural enzymes whatever that the process is well understood. I don't understand really well. It's well understood that you hang it there is like a natural decay. You know I'll put Doc say if I killed Doug I've got the Doug if I have like a wife or if I have a girlfriend or whoever doesn't want it or when I had my chance say Forget it I've got the duck put in the fridge now I might need to put it in a paper bag because someone might not want to see the duck every time they open the fridge but all rolled up in a paper bag or of still breathing I'll put in my fridge and I'll leave it in there a long time I might leave it in there ten days and that meat gets to where you could scrape it away with your thumb you know the inside that gutting this is where you've got to the burden might start to even smell a little off but the meat is getting just perfect you know increase the flavor enhances it gets more tender just like aging you know it's a Why was that move so good then.

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       I don't know just what it was eating just good. I've had part I mean we had we had a great piece off or eat it like kind of like the most tender part of the rear leg but just a great animal that there's so much variability like when that's one thing about being a wild game chef I am wild game Cook I think Chef sounds a little more formal but I'm a wild game cook and one thing about being a wild game cook that's more challenging than me and a regular Cook is you're dealing with so much variability like you get some great chef and he can do some amazing thing because he's got a purveyor you know and when he buys a pig it's like the pig a disc for 72 days and then we hit this for 14 days then we killed it on this day and chilled it at this temperature for these many days and you know and every time he buys a pig the pig comes in his kitchen or his restaurant and he knows he is nowhere is going to be like you know animals you don't know what kind of that there's age issues and what kind of trip they've been on there's all kinds of variability so you learn how to kind of control that and sort of bring the ingredients into line because some animals are good and some animals aren't.

Speaker 4:          02:47:14       I shot a milder one time that was just implied it was just disgusting to eat and then you get another meal there it's like that is so good that was the dish some salmon and then some. You know it's like you don't know what they've been up to or there's just a lot of mystery with it but that moose was a phenomenal moose. I've also had my buddy he was my buddy we had a falling out. I told a homeless guy he killed a moose. He brought the meat over. I thought he'd kill the Loch Ness monster.

Speaker 8:          02:47:41       I was like I'd never seen anything like it. It's just funky and nasty. He had a cow tag.

Speaker 4:          02:47:47       See one thing about shootin males on antlers game is you can get an idea of age the antlers betray the age there's a growth pattern they go through like if you see a fork you deer a spike on Deer It's like that's a one and a half you'll deer is gonna be great eating when you shoot an antler lists the clues are much more subtle what the guy looked at the two though so he had a cow mustache. He went on got a cow moose he later had someone look at the teeth and they estimated that thing to be 20 years old. Oh my God. It was like you couldn't really chew it tasted like Oh they taste like Oh that tastes like a sea monster I mean because it's really hard to tell. There is a guys that really know their business like you know Doug Dern and Wisconsin Doug Derek and look at Dougherty hold it is yeah. He's looked at so many damn deer. He's looking to see me do that live on his place.

Speaker 19:         02:48:36       He just knows like what their groove is you know isn't a weird sort of symbiotic relationship. Those deer have farmers like balls almost not really a wild animal.

Speaker 10:         02:48:44       Canada geese crows whitetail deer love people people.

Speaker 2:          02:48:51       Yeah. When we were at Doug's place I mean first of all what a fucking great guy he is.

Speaker 12:         02:48:56       Doug he's one of the bad guys one of the best. And I like to say it like a big ask I don't say this about many people. I don't throw this around lightly like he's a big hearted guy. Yeah I mean. It's not something I would really think of when I'm describing other individuals.

Speaker 2:          02:49:12       Yeah. No I'm so glad he introduced me to him. He's awesome and it was so cool. Me and me and Brian Cowan staying at his place and you know that he let us do that and film the show there and god damn there's a lot of deer up there. Jesus Christ. I mean we didn't see a lot of big bucks but god damn we saw a lot of deer.

Speaker 4:          02:49:30       And you told about this I think he did when he was a kid. If you cut saw a deer track you ran home and told your parents.

Speaker 2:          02:49:37       Wow you're in no frigging to your own. Well they've they've fucking grown in population we saw 16 the first day right. We saw about 16 deer at least.

Speaker 4:          02:49:45       But I mean know. Yeah I mean it's just that's like a real deer spot but they do have the early word they have a symbiotic relationship. Wait til deer have really are one of the winners. When it comes to development issues and in art like our good friend the milder which is more to me like it's a more romantic kind of mule deer and somebody would be like oh yeah we have mildew in my yard all the time. I know but generally they have they don't do as well. They don't do as well with fragmentation. They don't do as well. Kind of the stress. You know they have some things they like to eat. They're kind of wed to those things we like to eat and White tells like Oh yeah. That down I'll eat corn you know. They're just like they're always gonna find some. And that places is like a deer culture down there. Well there's a lot of places like that in this country. Oh yeah.

Speaker 14:         02:50:33       Oh Lord farm lands right like Illinois Iowa Kansas a lot of farmland.

Speaker 4:          02:50:37       Lot of crazy white tailed you get way way way more white tailed you than you had the time of European contact way more right now. That's nuts but still of every dude in America went out and shot a deer we'd be running like a 200 million deer deficit really no way. Wow. So people say to me like so you think everyone should go out and shoot their own meat. I'm like well we really couldn't we'd run on the critters. It's like it's going to always be like a fringe activity.

Speaker 2:          02:51:02       I think it's always gonna be a fringe activity anyway as long as society keeps going the way it is.

Speaker 4:          02:51:06       No no I'm not worried about that. I don't I don't stay up at night what I might. One of my goals not a goal but a thing I'd like to see happen is rather that I mean we could definitely have more hunters. I think we need more does to have political clout to defend our lifestyle. But I also would like to see the people who have no interest in hunting come to Reckitt Lake through understanding kind of the mechanics of wildlife start to recognize it as that hunting is legitimate useful practice not the opposite.

Speaker 2:          02:51:35       You know I think people that pay attention do see that I know for the most part the real issue is that most people have this sort of periphery view of it. They don't really look at it. They don't get in there and try to understand what can what is hunting what's going on with it. I know. Like I said my own personal transformation from looking at deer like why would you kill a beautiful animal. Oh you have to kill them. OK I get it. You know it's understanding what's going on. Oh well that actually keeps the population say well if you don't do that they run out of food. Well then as you know the massive strain on the resources and there there's well there's no predators in the wild fluctuations and I didn't get it. I had to look into it. But when you do look into it the only people that don't get it of the people that don't want to feel whether it's for moral political you know what. Whatever reasons whatever bias you have coming into it if you look at it objectively I don't I don't see how you could.

Speaker 25:         02:52:26       I don't see I could not get it.

Speaker 10:         02:52:28       No I think anyone who looks at wildlife politics in a way that's like immersive and you have to come to understand it. You go ask someone who runs a wildlife agency like a state wildlife agency or federal wildlife agency and ask them what their job would be like without having hunting as a tool. And you know it would make them shudder because you just you know it's so much it's gonna be very difficult to maintain the kind of the portfolio of different species we have at the levels we have.

Speaker 9:          02:53:01       You're gonna have to be. You'd have to be open to having really wild fluctuations having cycles of disease and things that aren't as pretty. And also why. Like why deny ourselves access to a renewable resource that generates so much revenue. It generates economic activity. It pay it's self-sustaining helps pay for itself.

Speaker 11:         02:53:21       And it's fun. People don't want to say that for whatever reason they don't say killing animals is fun. Seems like it's a mean thing to say now. I love Hunt man it's fun. I always say that it's not you're not being mean. It's not. It's an exciting activity that speaks to your DNA.

Speaker 4:          02:53:37       I always tell people I wouldn't because I heart like I'll talk about the food element of it. I wouldn't hunt if it wasn't for the food. I wouldn't hunt if it wasn't for the fun.

Speaker 2:          02:53:45       Yeah you know I mean it's it's both it's exciting and you could watch the meat eater online now.
