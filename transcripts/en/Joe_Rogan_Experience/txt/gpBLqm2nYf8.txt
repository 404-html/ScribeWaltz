And the code word is Joe. We're also brought to you by blue apron. Blue Apron is a, a new podcast sponsor that I really enjoy and I, I've been using it lately. I had, um, what it is, is they send you all the ingredients and, um, detailed a photographic instructions of how to cook them for healthy meals. And, uh, I just had amine, these peppers, he stuffed peppers the other day, like be stuffed peppers. It was really good. Um, it's really delicious stuff and it's super healthy. 500, 700 calories per serving and you would really imagine that it'd be more than that, uh, because it tastes really good. It tastes like, like, Ooh, it's probably can't be good for you. But they're designed, uh, by, uh, by chefs, nutritionists and it's a really, really yummy stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Nine 99 per meal, they'll send you the ingredients in the exact right proportions with simple recipe instructions right to your door. You know, for a lot of folks, ordering out is expensive and it can get pretty unhealthy. Um, shipping and cooking can be tough too. Or shopping rather shopping and cooking. It's like if you get a recipe book and you want to go out and buy all the stuff and it, you got to look around and you gotta like measure shit. Blue Apron takes care of all that stuff and uh, they work around your schedule and your dietary preferences. Cooking takes about a half an hour. Shipping is always free. And they'll never send you the same meal twice. Really yummy stuff. Um, I'll give you a list of some of the stuff that they have now. Um, this is, uh, here's, here's one of them. Um, egg plants with chicken thighs, cod with Parmesan crusted squash, spice rubbed pork medallions with peach salsa.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       This is not like boring food. It's really delicious. Chicken breasts, Gumbo with chicken sausage and Okra pan seared scallops with sauteed Sungolds. Everything you get comes in like one of those styrofoam containers. It's packed with dry ice, so it stays cold for like two days. Mexican style Turkey Burger. It's not like they're not bland foods either. They're, they're really delicious and a blue pit. Like I said, a blue apron ships for free to your door. And if you want to try it out, see what's on the menu this week and get your first two meals for free. Go to blue apron.com/rogan that's the first two meals free just for going to blue apron.com/. Rogan I recommend them. I use them. And like I said, I cook just a few days ago, I had this, a delicious stuffed peppers. It was spicy but not too spicy, was really good stuff. Uh, blue apron.com/rogan and last but finally not least on it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       O n n I t we are a human optimization website and uh, we have a, a new product or a new version of our product, a t plus a, which is a total strength plus performance thing. We just got a new clinical trial results or we got new clinical trial results in on t plus on, uh, some, some tests. It's all available on at.com, uh, some tests that we did on a weightlifters, um, clinical trial for strength based athletes and all of the information on any of the supplements, uh, any of the products that we sell at on it, we have a research page on every, if you go to each individual page for each individual ingredient has a research page. If you go to it, the research page, explain to you like for instance if you got a shroom tech, shroom tech is a quarter seps mushroom supplement that's designed to increase endurance and oxygen utilization.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       And you're like, why the fuck is that about? Well, if you go to the shroom tech page, you will see all of the research along with references that explains the mechanisms behind each individual ingredient, why it works, how they work synergistically, and what the studies have been done. And you know, what, what has been proven about these individual ingredients? Well, we're trying to do it on it is we live in a fantastic time. And one of the beautiful things about this time is there's so much information out there and there were many, many things that can benefit you physically. Many things that can benefit you mentally as far as your cognitive function. Um, you know, and there's, there's a lot of bullshit out there too and it's hard to figure out what's the bullshit and, and what's the real shit well at, on it, we have isolated what we find to be all of the most beneficial supplements.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       And we sell them to you. We sell them to you at a very reasonable rate with great ethics. If you buy any of the supplements at on it and you feel like, oh, it's kind of bullshit. I'm not really into this. This is, this is a waste of my money. We have a 100% money back guaranteed. First 30 pills, the order you have 90 days, you don't have to return the pills. You just say the stuffed socks, you get your money back. All we're trying to do is make a good relationship with you. We're trying to create a relationship where we sell you the best shit you could possibly get and you feel good about it. If you don't feel good about it, that kind of relationship sucks for everybody. It's negative, it's bad, it's bad energy. It's not good for anybody. We're not interested.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       We're only interested on selling things to people that are going to benefit you and that you're going to feel good about the relationship that you have. We sell strength and conditioning equipment, everything that you need for functional strength, meaning strength that you can use an athletic endeavors like kettle bells, steel, maces, battle ropes. Uh, we sell medicine balls and ab wheels. We also have workout DVDs like the excellent Keith Webber, extreme kettlebell cardio series, Keith Weber who will be on the show, uh, in the next couple of months. We're working out the details right now, but I'm a big fan of that guy and it's, his workouts are insane. There's so fun to do. If you're thinking about starting into any sort of an exercise program, look, if he's thinking about starting a health program, just get right on it, you know, as far as eating healthy and then mild exercise.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       But if you're thinking about doing anything as far as strenuous physical activity, I please start off slowly. It's the most important thing. The last thing you want to do is try to exercise and then get injured and be fucked for six months. He don't want that to happen. So start off slowly. Pick a lightweight if you can afford it. Hire a trainer to show you the, the, the basic movements in, in the correct form so that you're not injuring yourself and start off slow. Um, if you can't hire a trainer, there's plenty of DVDs, plenty of youtube videos online. You can go and just simple, basic exercises are broken down. Do it slowly. Please. Take your time, build up, write down your results, write down your goals and get your shit together. Son and Gals, gals, daughter. So I did 10 called girls, daughter, a daughter that's just fucking creepy called dude son. It's okay. Anyway, go to Onnit. I've talked too much on and.com O. N. N. I t. Use the codeword Rogan. Save 10% off any and all supplements. Relaxed. Ladies and gentlemen, sit down, grab a cup of coffee. We're going to discuss society. We're going to figure out what the fuck makes this thing tick. And is there a better way to go about it? Joe Quirk is here from the seasteading institute. Young Jamie. Cue The music,

Speaker 1:          00:09:36       the Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All Day. Hello everybody. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       for those of you who are not familiar with my guests, Joe Quirk is from the seasteading institute and the seasteading institute. Seasteading is a very unique concept and it's been going around, uh, over the last x amount of years online. There've been all these articles and videos where people have talked about international waters going out and creating a city, a floating city and trying to reengineer society. This is, you know, all of the land and the earth has been sort of claimed and taken. You can't really start your own cult in the middle of nowhere without the government coming in and crashing your parade. But can you build a city and design a utopia based on the mistakes that we see in society today? Is that a fairly accurate way of describing seasteading

Speaker 3:          00:10:36       one of the misperceptions is that seasteading is not about creating one. See stead. It's about closest you can get to this thing. We always have them in. Yeah. Did you move it around too? Okay, good. Sorry. We, we can, uh, we want to create as many steps as possible to provide people with the technology to found their own floating country. And the key idea is 193 national governments don't represent the range of ideas that 7 billion people have produced. And we're sort of have these government monopolies that, uh, uh, you know, control the decisions people make. And in order to have solutions for how to live together, we have to force them through these 193 government monopolies and technology and every other front is moving forward. And the thing that's holding us back isn't it? We're not innovating in the technology of governance. So the key idea is if we can create a silicon valley of the, see if we can get, you know, thousands of Hong Kong's and Singapore's in aisles of man's on the ocean and allow innovators to go out there and form their own societies will discover new ways of living together and we'll push forward a evolution in governance.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       And what's the stop? Some fucking psycho like Jamie over here starting the Jamie country. And, uh, just having like a one mile square thing that he's built some raft and it's, uh, you know, some, he's got some Mad Max style world. No, nothing, right?

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       Yeah. Well this is the key idea. I mean, Jamie can go out there and declare himself, you know, tyrant of Jamie's dead. But the problem is he has to attract people to come to his see stud and you just hit on the key idea that makes floating a nation's different from land based nations. I mean, if you're a some evil dude and you take control of a land based nation, you got it. You got monopoly control over those people. Those people don't have any choice. That's the problem with modern governments. We can't choose among them. Like we can't among other products that advanced quickly if we're on the sea, you got to compete to attract immigrants. You've got to compete to attract investment. You've got to compete to attract people to uh, uh, give you money so that you can build a business in a way that they think is profitable.

Speaker 3:          00:12:35       Uh, you got to attract different kinds of ideologues out there. It's going to start as a business. I mean, if you think of countries as being founded by conquerors and the future ceased eds being founded by creators, what I like to call aquaponic sewers, that sets up a completely different dynamic. And if people can choose amongst the studs that will drive what we think will be a market of competing governments competing to police people. And then this will unleash the innovation that's out there. Uh, somebody, you know, for the past half century, people have come up with wonderful ideas for how we could live together. People have, you can go online and look up all sorts of interesting rule sets. Uh, the problem is all ground is claimed and there's no place we can try this out. So the, the technology for permanent floating structures is coming. Half the earth's surfaces is unclaimed by existing governments. Uh, we have a new frontier and I think it's time we started colonizing it and building floating cities.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       It's a very interesting concept. Um, but I'm going to be honest, my own personal feeling about it, it's not, not my opinion of how it should go about, but my own feeling when I hear this, the idea that I go, yeah, that would be interesting, but man, it brings up all these other problems. Like some crazy fuckers are going to have their own weird countries floating out there and who's going to, what kind of lawless lands are you going to create? What kind of weirdness? But when I think about, when I analyze my own thoughts about it, my own instinctive reaction to it, like it's just the, I know there's something wrong with the way society is structured today, but change brings a whole new set of problems and people are afraid of change. Yeah. Like

Speaker 3:          00:14:19       to understand, uh, seasteading you kind of have to go deep about where solutions come from. And so what's the right way to live together? The answer is we don't know. Uh, what's the right way to make this microphone? We don't know. Uh, these kind of magnificent solutions. They're not designed by some really smart person. They emerge from millions of people competing in a market to please us. And so we're on this exponential, uh, a rocket, uh, in all areas except governance. And the problem is, is that that governments are monopolies and most of the problems were afraid of, uh, existing among current monopolies of governance. And the key idea is that on the water, a fluid environment is fundamentally different from the land based environment. If you have a chunk of land, it's, it's very easy for a conquered take it and declare monopoly control and then the government doesn't advance.

Speaker 3:          00:15:11       It just, it has no incentive to advance if you're on the water. And countries can only form if people choose to attach to each other, there is no land unless you attract people to come visit you. If those people aren't happy with your assisted, they can detach and move somewhere else. We'll have a completely different situation where instead of citizen's competing to survive their government's decisions, governments will be competing to survive citizens decisions. So if you're a governor and you're competing to attract citizens and you go bankrupt and you're cced, ed disappears is people detach. And move fluidly somewhere else, it'll be much harder for it to kind of control consolidation. And then you're not even thinking about citizens. You're thinking about customers looking for the kind of governance they want. And when you think about it, this is variation and selection, uh, variation by governments, selection by citizens.

Speaker 3:          00:16:05       Uh, and I started as a science writer and a novelist. I wrote a lot about evolution. I thought about why as their progress in the world, why is there, why aren't things just chaotic? Uh, how, how has our brain so sublime in biology that it can understand these symbols? And I'm sending to you, why is this coffee Mug, uh, so available, so cheap and so plentiful? It's because of variation and selection, decentralized variation, selection. Uh, and when I was exposed to pottery, Freedman's ideas about evolution, like in the primal soup of the ocean, I realized he was right. We're on a fluid frontier where people can detach and move about and choose the societies they want. You would have variation and selection. And we unleashed the kind of progress we see in markets and technologies in governance. And we think of governance as a technology.

Speaker 4:          00:16:58       I think it's really interesting, this comparison that you made in a recent video that I watched about cell phones and the competition that drives cell phones to innovate, and the reason why we have such amazing phones today, while we have all these apps, while we have all these incredible cameras, great battery life, and it's because there's this incredible competition in multiple platforms all across the world. Everyone's trying to come up with the biggest, best thing every year, but in government you have none of this. You don't have any competition. It's not a bunch of people competing to see who could, whose ideas are the best. It's a very rigid, strict structure that's in place. It's been in place for a long time. It's archaic. It's, it's very, very flawed. The representative government that we have in this country today, when you look at the influence that they have, the, and you look at the influences on them as far corporate interest, special interest groups, lobbyists, it's all madness.

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       I mean, no one in their right mind. If you had a chance to reengineer society, no one would look at it and go, perfect. There's no reason to fuck with this. This is, this thing is great. Right? You know, it's a terrible, terrible system and it's the only system we have and it, it is the system. And if you try to change that system, you're a trader or a psycho or whatever the fuck you are, an anarchist, you're a cult member. WhatW or cult leader, um, this idea is that this same sort of competition that has led everything to innovate to the incredible degree that it is at today, whether it's computers, whether it's cars, all the things that we seen in joy today in our society that, that, that are at this incredibly high level. It's because of competition. And that is the exact thing that is wrong with our government. This stagnation is two party system influenced by corporations that has the same mandate, the same ideas, the same tired rhetoric over and over and over again. And seasteading you believe offers a potential opportunity to break that mold.

Speaker 3:          00:18:57       Yes. And it's about breaking the mold. And I think, uh, the future of humanity turns on the pivot of this problem because everything is advancing very quickly. Uh, but governance is not, and it because it is these monopolies like you and I don't have to argue about, you know, which app we're going to have on our iPhone. And then we all vote on the APP and then that we all get one app and we have to agree on it. And then we have to wait four years to vote on the next APP. We're all going to get, no, we, we apps pull refrigerate, we all get to choose them. And, and this drives innovation in that field. Um, and you know, governments, you can imagine the government we're in right now, there's like 300 million people that have to fight with each other over these small little changes.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       And then everyone ends up with a bitter compromise and nobody is happy. And I've been astonished at how people pushing forward this blue frontier have been independently attracted to the metaphor of apps. So there's this Dutch guy, uh, a coon Othias, I'm pronouncing his name wrong. I don't know how to speak Dutch, but, uh, he runs water studio. Um, and he is, has already created what he calls city apps. So we take shipping containers and he convinced them into schools. He converts them into a water purification units. He converts them into the hospitals and he proposes, he wants to float these things too crappy coastal governments and park them in the slums and provide schools and those kinds of things for children. And the, the advantage these things have is that they're moveable. Suppose the government says, we don't want that. Well then you can move them, move it somewhere else. Uh, it, it's much easier than having to build a school in those areas. And he calls this program city apps and I bet you he's going to be doing this in the next couple of years.

Speaker 4:          00:20:44       How far out do you have to be from shore? Does it vary from to country?

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       It depends on what we're talking about. It's, it varies slightly from country to country in some cases. Uh, it's 12 miles. So, for instance, uh, some cs sitters or are physicians and biotech entrepreneurs and they're interested in innovating in this space of stem cells or in, in biotech, and feel like the regulations written in 1970 or holding back innovations written in 2020 another problem with monopolies. They can't update their rules. So we're just stuck with these old rules. Some of these guys just want to get a cease dead 12 miles off shore and start pushing forward. Uh, stem cells and biotech, which is personalized medicine is the future of medicine. It can change everything. Other people want to get floating hospitals, um, offshore, cheaper, better, faster care, millions of people travel, uh, uh, you know, to India to get cheaper, better, faster care from, uh, you know, American trained physicians. Why take a plane all the way across the world and you can take a ferry just off shore. But to really be truly an independent country, you have to go, uh, about 200 miles off shore, 200

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       miles. Yeah. Um, that's a really interesting point you just brought up about medicine, about a cheaper, easier, faster care or better care. That's a, that's a very complex and tricky issue because a lot of people are worried about quacks, a lot of people worried about people that are not following all the regulations that had been set by the American Medical Association and that you would attract bad people, bad ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:22:25       Then. So thinking about the fluid frontier requires us to rethink these assumptions that we bring to this. So imagine the fluid frontier. That's what you're calling the ocean. I got, I got a million of these little phrases. I like the blue frontier. So imagine I'm a quack quirk. The quack and I go out there and I start offering some crazy procedure that causes cancer and kills be enhancement, but enhancement caulking. Let's do, um, uh, if, if I start killing people, I, I'm in a market, I don't have a monopoly that the first see stet that like kill somebody or causes a disaster. That will be the end of that. Cease dead. No one will move there. No. And we'll go there. No one will invest in it. Uh, just to take an example, one of the guys I'm going to feature in my seasteading book is a doctor Chris Centeno, and he's innovated in the realm of stem cells.

Speaker 3:          00:23:16       Uh, there's people that lost, uh, I'll, I'll take an example. Jarvis Green. He's a two time super bowl champ. He lost cartilage under his kneecap. Chris Santana was one of the, he has like a thousand successful operations where he basically take stem cells out of your hip, reinject them into your joint, you grow a new cartilage like a baby. Uh, Jarvis Green had been forced to retire. Uh, he took Santana those treatments. He grew it back as cartilage and he jumped out of bed and signed with the Houston Texans. He's had fabulous success with his procedure. Uh, after a thousand more than a thousand successful procedures, uh, the FDA knock on his door and said, uh, you can't offer this procedure. Um, it's now illegal in the United States, this particular thing. So he was forced to license his procedure to the Cayman Islands, uh, to, uh, to, uh, a company called schematics. So now people are flying to the Cayman Islands to get this procedure done. Um, so you know, economists call this regulatory capture. We have this instinct that if you just make a monopoly of regulators and put them in place, that will protect us. But what ends up happening is the dominant industries within that area end up controlling the regulations are having undue influence in the regulations well is

Speaker 4:          00:24:35       process that this guy has to go through in order to clear this particular procedure that he hasn't done yet.

Speaker 3:          00:24:40       Well at, at first he thought he, that he did and he thought that it was all legit, but the FDA is unclear about what its jurisdiction is. They, they came in and literally declared that your own stem cells once taken from your body and process are now drugs. So they're like, okay, well the, your stem cells are now drugs. So now we have jurisdiction. We're telling you to stop. And you know, that's absurd. I, I'm actually quoting from the letter they sent Centeno your stem cells are now our drugs.

Speaker 4:          00:25:11       Wow. Well, there's this a process that I've gone through call Regena keen or you're aware of this? Um, you've heard of it? I don't think so. There's a, a doctor, um, I think his name's Peter Weller from uh, Germany. He created this procedure where you take blood out of a person's body, he spin it in a centrifuge and apply heat to it and they heated blood produces this incredibly potent anti inflammatory agent and it's the, it's extracted from the blood. It's like a yellow serum and injected directly into areas of inflammation, joint swelling, things along those lines. Then that's very similar. Yeah, probably.

Speaker 3:          00:25:49       And Imagine I can donate my blood to somebody else, but now I can't donate my own stem cells to myself.

Speaker 4:          00:25:55       Well, this is does, what I'm confused is this procedure is legal in the United States. It's illegal. It's called off label. If it wasn't for a while, they had it in Germany and the like Coby Bryant, a lot of these athletes were flying to July. The UFC guys flew to Germany to get this procedure done, but now it's available in several different places in America. I got mine done at this place called lifespan medicine in Santa Monica. And uh, it's incredible. I mean, it has an amazing effect on knees. Amazing effect. I've had it done on my neck, on my back. I mean, it's just any, any areas that were like problem areas, you can reduce inflammation in this incredible way, but it's essentially the same thing. It's taking your own blood out, making it, turning into the serum and then injecting it back into your body. What's different about what this guy's doing that it's illegal? Do you know?

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       Uh, I don't know. I mean, think of it, what were talking about as a new innovation? Uh, people are coming up with new innovations and the climate among people innovating in health care and in, especially with stem cells and with biotech is one of fear. Like they don't know what the government is going to tell them to do because the rules are unclear. They're very complex and they keep changing the rules. And this stifles the innovation we need. So if you look at, you know, the psychodramas of our age, it's, you know, healthcare, it's banking. It's, you know, the public environment. It's education, it's war, it's all the things that governments micromanage. And so why aren't these things improving with all the other things we use that aren't micromanaged by government? It's because we don't have an innovation because the government monopolies ultimately don't permit them. If you have a monopoly, you don't want people to compete with you. Um, and we want to provide more market competition on the ocean in a place where you don't have to, you know, aggress against anyone on the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       Well, there's negatives against this micromanagement, but isn't there some benefits like, like for instance, the government has been cracking down on Doctor Oz lately for all these bogus fat loss claims. Like this has been all these different things that he's shield on his show that her mirror, he calls them literally in his own words, miracle, fat loss cures. Sure. And then it turns out they don't reduce fat at all. They literally do nothing. And then he's in trouble for that. That's important, right? I mean, isn't that what they're worried about with this stuff that someone can tell you, hey man, we're going to take some part of your hip out and we're going to fix your spinal Bifida. We're going to fix your scoliosis, we going to fix whatever the hell you got. We're going to inject in India. And it turns out it's not doing Jack Shit. Yeah. You know, there might be some sort of a placebo effect that some people report. So you have some conflicting evidence, but is it an important that there's some sort of a government regulatory or at least a board of physicians who are knowledgeable in whatever field that approve or disprove any sort of procedure? Isn't that important?

Speaker 3:          00:28:41       I think these kinds of things are important and, but it's even more important to hit restart once in a while. Okay. So if, if people want to stop, uh, you know what you're doing that you like about the reinjection of the blood. I've never heard of this. They can call forth a rule, uh, you know, written in 1975 that the people that wrote those rules were not able to predict this innovation that happened in 2014 or whenever it happened. Right. And the idea is with a new blue fluid rules on the ocean, we have to start again with a new regulatory structure. And this happens naturally when there's competition against, against monopolies.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       So in a sense, you're trying to do what the founding fathers of the United States did. They tried to see what's going wrong in Europe and what, what they don't like about the, the system that they were a controlled under. They leave, they come to America, establish this new country, set forth these new rules and regulations is new ideas. And then a couple of hundred years later they turned a dog. Shit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Whenever it's a monopoly and it ends up turning into deduction,

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       how do you stop that from happening on Jamie? See stead because Jamie looks like a goddamn dictated to me. I think you get that guy out there on the sea. He's got his own little island. Next thing you know, he's banging all the women. It's like Waco in the ocean.

Speaker 3:          00:29:59       Yeah, and I'm glad you're putting this in the perspective of the United States because I think of the United States, it was a giant life raft where, you know, tens of millions of people who are misfits in their home countries came here to try out their crazy ideas and they discover new ways of living together that ended up changing the whole world. And if they're never been this giant life raft where people could try something new right now, we'd be arguing, you know, which works better, communism or Mara and Arche, they'll be the only options that we have. The United States discovered new things that people just take for granted. Like, you know, democracy in women's rights and things like this. It, it, it, it happened all over the world. Now Jamie goes out on the ocean and starts his own, cease dead. Uh, he's not claiming some giant bunch of land with a bunch of captive citizens that he can control. He has to convince people that he sees dead can make a profit that is cced. Ed. Can provide blue drops and attract people out there that his sees Stenvall survive a competing with other seats, debts. And imagine an environment where citizens at anytime can detach, uh, from a CSWE dead and float to a different system.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       But can they really? Because if you have a c stead, say if you ha what's, let's define a c stent, because I'm thinking it's a floating city, but the floating city flooding cities have condos, condos. You buy, you're stuck there. You've got a mortgage. You're not going anywhere. You're stuck on is floating city. Jamie goes crazy. He's doing math now. God dammit, I got a Goddamn condo on this. Meth heads. See stead. I can't get off. I owe this money. I'm upside down on my loan. What am I going to do? I have a family. My kids go to school and the sea stud.

Speaker 3:          00:31:34       Yeah. That's what happens in land based governments, right? One way to think about this is, is the Dutch, you know, uh, their country is sinking. Uh, they're building floating homes. They built a floating pavilion. They're working on a fallen. Sure, they're, they're there. They're there. They've been fighting, uh, against the water for a hundred years. Building dams, you know, little Dutch boy that plugged the damn finger, uh, there they're so accustomed to the water when you go there and suggest we need to build a floating cities and they don't think it's crazy. Uh, and the company we're working with on our floating city project, Delta Sync Syn see, speaks explicitly about, uh, the mobility of moving units forming floating cities and how this will create a kind of market of competitive governments that would be peaceful, that would empower citizens and disempowered governments so that governments are going to be constantly aquatic. Governments will be hustling to attract citizens rather than hustling to seize control of them. Because the ocean is such a fundamentally a different medium, which

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       human nature can compete now. Have you ever, I'm sure you have Sydney. Me. I thought, wait, what about crop? Like how are you going to protect citizens from invading, sees debtors from pirates? How are we not going to have like waterworld first of all? Yeah. Yeah. We get this a lot. And, and, and one way to think about it is that there's about a hundred thousand boats on the sea right now. And civilization required. Yeah. Like at this moment riding around the whole world. I think so. Yeah. Seems like there'd be more than that criss crossing and most of them are in docs and they're dropping stuff off. And you know, if it weren't for all this fluid commerce, the, the, you know, the, the world economy would collapse. I thought it was way more than a hundred thousand votes on the whole planet. Three quarters water. Yeah. It doesn't matter. And, uh, if you think about it, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       all those boats have to have some form of security. And when you, when you hear about violence, you almost always hear about land based governments involved in violence. You rarely hear about violence and crime on ships though it occurs. So all civilization requires some kind of security and all these boats have water propulsor and they have sound propulsion. They have, they have armed guards. I think at this point, 75% of, of, uh, of, um, container ships have a armed patrols on board. And I've written cruise ships, I've walked around American cities, cruise ships or the size of skyscrapers, and they're a lot safer than some of the American cities I've been in. So security is really not a problem if you're going to, uh, you know, make a new floating nation, you should have some security. But if you think about Iceland, Malta, Bora, Bora, Bora, Barbados, there's so many islands out there, defenseless against the big nations Cayman Islands as an example. Uh, they have no standing army. A lot of, a lot of island nations have no standing army. They do business with the big nations. And the way I put it is, you know, if you're going to found your see stead, think like a cleaner fish in the world of sharks. You know, China's not invading Hong Kong. The United States is invading the Cayman Islands. Uh, Malaysia hasn't invaded Singapore. When new island nations provide huge economic value to the big nations, they do quite well.

Speaker 5:          00:34:56       So the idea is that just there'll be, it'll be some sort of a benefit that the rest of the countries have, uh, by these competing governments. Don't, but don't you think that they would find that these competing governments put pressure on them to sort of innovate and that they would, they would want to stifle that and some sort of way?

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       Well, we shall see because that's one of the key ideas. I mean, people little, uh, understand the power of small island nations to change the policies of great nations. And there are numerous examples of this. The most obvious one would be Hong Kong. You know, Hong Kong gained some level of independence from China, uh, was sort of an interesting hybrid called East meets West. And it created like wealth in a very short period of time, uh, embarrassing China into changing its policies. And China has a lot of problems, but by opening its markets with a, you know, d din chow pains, open door policy, it's, it's caused at least a half billion Chinese to, uh, to escape poverty. Um, because of the example set by Hong Kong. And there examples like this over and over, um, uh, Portugal decriminalized drugs, uh, scientific American published the fabulous effects and you know, that's changing policies and the rest of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:36:13       I can go on and on with this. Estonia with the flat tax little island nations innovate in ways that large, uh, continental nations, uh, imitate. And we want to create more of these. Uh, when we look at like the African island of Mauritius, when we look at Hong Kong, when we look at Singapore, when we look at the Isle of Man, all these places have innovated and effected and been used as, uh, uh, examples of policies that have been instituted by larger nations. Now when it comes to a practical application of this, well, how far away do you think we are from a legitimate see stead nation? And it depends on how you define a c stead. Uh, right now we're working on the floating city project, which we're getting the, the Dutch company I mentioned before, Delta Sync, uh, created a feasibility study. So we hope to have a small, uh, floating a floating city with some level of, uh, independence in a, a host nations territorial waters, hopefully by 20, 20.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       If all goes according to plan six years. Yeah. And this will be in the territorial, uh, shallow waters. Right. Okay. So it'll be under the jurisdiction of that particular government. It'll be under the jurisdiction of that particular government. And we've got, uh, uh, you know, we're closing in on deals with those governments willing to offer us some level of independence to see what we can create. And this is not a radical idea. I mean, the special economic zone movement that's happening across developed nations is all based on this idea of we'll, we'll, we'll create one little space where people can experiment with new rules because even we politicians or recognize that our government is screwed up. Uh, we'll see what kind of wealth can be created. I mean, Hong Kong started a movement that's happened all across the world where now we're proposing, let us do a floating one.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       We don't need any year land. Let's see what we can create me, but we can hire some local people. So we went to create a demonstration, cease dead, uh, that'll attract some attention and attract more brains to the problem. And then hopefully we'll be able to move further out and solve the remaining engineering challenges of floating breakwaters and a large enough see steads to remain stable on the high seas. And this is, um, this, this is, uh, an engineering challenge that remains to be solved. But if you think about Shell's prelude is, um, larger than the empire state building. It's a floating oil and gas facility that'll, they've built the hall and it should be on the water by 2017. Um, it's going to be an international waters for 25 years. Um, all the technologies are sort of closing in on, on solving the problem of creating a floating structure on the sea.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       And I think the more creative people we attract to this problem, I think the quicker we'll solve the problem and have a floating city, I think it will happen in the next couple of decades and it's easier to float than fly. Uh, we have space stations floating above us. We can certainly makes these stations. It's just the people have been more sold on the idea of space. Uh, they haven't been sold on the idea of floating cities. This is a pretty radical proposition to invest a significant amount of your time and like what, what led you down this road? Because this is, I mean, this isn't just like, hey man, let's move to Vancouver because the United States sucks. This is like, let's start our own thing and let's do it in it's very radical way. What, what was it that made you want to, you know, invest so much of your time?

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       Uh, being part of Silicon Valley and seeing that so much innovation comes from people being able to freely compete and come up with new innovations, and all of a sudden, I'm using instantaneous global telepathy, which we call Twitter. I never would have imagined such a thing could exist 20 years ago. Um, and I think we radically underestimate the potential for innovation. Uh, and I'm very excited about the future of technology and I'm in deep despair about the future of governance. Uh, and when I saw that, uh, mobile nations on the sea that can disassemble and be reassembled elsewhere according to the decisions of the citizens, uh, I realized, wow, this is a fundamentally different way in which human nature can compete. That would be much less about conquering and killing and much more about creating value and attracting people to move there. And you know, we're living in a world where, you know, you and I are a member of the global 1%.

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       You know, the World Bank, uh, estimated that if you make 34,000 US dollars a year, you're a part of the global 1%. Meanwhile, we have this bottom billion who worked for less than a dollar 25 a day. $34,000 a year is a global 1% yes. That's, that's what the World Bank estimated. Another group estimated about 55. That's unbelievable if shive k yeah. And it's so it's like Americans have taken the upper part of the hockey stick and just chopped off the 1% of that and start complaining about that. It's not hilarious. Yeah. So we are, we are fabulously wealthy with our access to institutions and there's another billion people or 800 million depending on how you look at it and who don't have access to this. And a Gallup poll in 2009, uh, there was 700 million people who told this poll, I want to leave my country forever. Get the hell Outta here and go somewhere else.

Speaker 3:          00:41:42       And all the existing nations are acting as gated communities, locking them out. This is not counting the people that say, oh, I want to go somewhere for a short period of time, make my money and come back. And these are all the people. Like tomorrow I will leave my home. So there's desperate people who want to go somewhere. Um, I think see, steads won't be able to survive without immigration, without attracting immigrants. So a lot of seeds sitters or are interested in aquaculture, creating vast, uh, seaweed farms on the sea, vast algae farms, uh, to provide the world with food and fuel. The great thing about algae is that they grow their own bio mass with a carbon and nutrients, both of which are polluting the oceans. So you could in a sense feed and fuel the world with greenhouse gas. If you could ramp up these, uh, ocean farms to the scale needed to feed people, you'd need to hire millions of people, uh, to have these farms. I don't think you and I are going to go work an algae farm, but I think people in Yemen or Somalia or Afghanistan would gladly take a jobs there. I mean there's migrant workers are fleeing their countries and trying to find better lives everywhere. And I, and I'm, one of the reasons I'm interested in seasteading is I think we have the potential to uplift a significant proportion of the bottom billion.

Speaker 4:          00:43:07       If you did develop this, how would you or would you at all control immigration to your c Stud? I mean, how do you, how do you weed out the undesirable, how do you keep people that are murderers and criminals from other countries that are fleeing jurisdictions of wherever they're from? They get in a boat and they show up at your c stead and just fuck the whole thing up.

Speaker 3:          00:43:30       Security. Hopefully like you can imagine you start a avast algae farm, you're going to be interested in, in being safe. And there's, there's already, uh, numerous, uh, security industry's working the oceans that provide security for all sorts of ocean going vessels so that, that industry already exists and it does a better job than, you know, land based, uh, cops and military is actually, um, but if you offer a better jobs, if you offer a blue jobs to vehicle, uh, they'll take those jobs. Um, especially when you consider, they were talking twice, the population in the United States has announced that they're ready to go somewhere else. Um, there's not, there's not many places they can go. And you know, I was talking to a, uh, a woman from Senegal. [inaudible] got weighed and she was telling me, you know, people from my country, they a stowaway on boats.

Speaker 3:          00:44:22       Um, and they, and they, you know, they die. They drown. She says there are fish food. There are people so desperate to get out of their countries, they're jumping on boats, not knowing where they're going to go. Just get me anywhere, get me out of this hell hole. And those people will take a better opportunities. Um, just like, you know, I'm Irish a hundred years ago, uh, my ancestors were extremely poor. They took better jobs in the United States, low paying jobs, and now they're, their grandchildren are living lives of fabulous prosperity and we need to keep this going. We need more life rafts out there for the bottom billion. So would you have any sort of a filtering system to keep people out? Would you verify passports and do background checks on people before you allow the man mean? What's the idea behind that? It was just going to be open and figure out how to do it along the way when, when things go bad.

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       I mean, what's the, and you've got to, and one way to think about this is it's not a, it's not about designing a society. I have no ability to design the society. Uh, I'm working to provide the technology so that other people can design their societies, um, and the like new countries created in the past few decades, uh, apply more modern rules to their founding and they do better jobs that, you know, there's been a something like 29 new countries since like 1990. I hope I'm getting those numbers. Really. Yeah. There's, there's been like, um, where are they? They're like 6 cents a, you know, 2000 to really yeah. People don't realize new countries are created all the time and people have to say that. I've never even heard mostly countries breaking up into smaller pieces. Um, and um, are any promising? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I think, uh, East Donia is incredibly exciting and it's, it's innovating in ways larger countries are not, you know, they've innovated in the realm of a flat tax, which was unthinkable.

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       Um, and I think I counted something like, since Estonia innovated in the area of the flat tax, they grew it like twice the rate of surrounding European nations causing arguments among their politicians to, to, to, uh, instantiate a flat tax. I kind of like 22 countries that have adopted, he's Stoney is innovation. So new countries innovate, old countries do not. And New Co, the new startup countries set the examples that change things. So why are we waiting for historical accident? I'd like to create thousands of these. So the, the place where you have to let go of the desire for control is to realize it's going to be up to the founders of these societies how they're going to provide security. It's going to be up to the founders who they're gonna hire and what they're going to pay them there. There were not controlling, we're empowering people to try things.

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       And the reason I'm less afraid of aquatic nations than continental nations is because aquatic nations will have to attract people to live there. You're not going out and you're, you're not conquering some place where people live and saying, I'll keep everyone safe. You're saying I got to provide you an incentive to come live with me. And then there'll be other see steads for the same workers, for the same innovators, for the same doctors and lawyers. If they provide better and cheaper services than people will detach and move there. We're in a situation where there's nothing stopping the inexhaustible growth of governments because they are monopolies and we, I think humanity has to innovate in this space and it requires this deep mind flip to think about the difference between competing over land and competing over fluid. Think of them as houseboats on a, on a liquid. It's much harder to seize monopoly control with your, with your military over

Speaker 4:          00:48:05       a bunch of boats on the ocean. Is it though? I mean it seems like they were just kind of surround you like if you tried to do a Waco in the ocean, it seems that if you had like the branch Davidian complex out there in the middle of the ocean, like I know Jamie's planning, we'll get that motherfucker look at him over there. He's planning. If you decided to do that and build some city and put up giant barbwire fence and have sex with everybody, his wife and the in store a lot of weapons, the government would probably come in. I mean, if you say security, and I'm obviously playing devil's advocate here, but if you say, uh, everyone will be responsible for security and your, she's dead. Well, at what point does security become an army? Like, are you allowed to have a jet? Are you allowed to have nuclear weapons? Are you allowed to have, you know, if you innovate to the point where you're, you're, you're building some fucking Tesla weapons out in the middle of the ocean, they can shoot down anything that comes anywhere near you. At what point is the government gonna feel threatened by you and move in? How big can you get? I mean, do you, does every seasteading nation have to be, um, sort of either like a satellite of a larger nation? You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       Well, um, conquerors have incentives. And the way to think about how this works is to think about precedents that already exist. Um, so let's see. It's, is it the islands of, um, Barbados and Bora Bora that are just a few miles off the coast of Venezuela, a independent countries that are much wealthier and Venezuela doesn't attack them? Uh, the Cayman Islands, you know, in many ways takes a spiteful stance towards the regulatory structure. The United States welcomes lots of, you know, uh, physician mavericks and Financial Mavericks to their shores. The United States doesn't attack the Cayman Islands.

Speaker 4:          00:49:44       Right. But they're not 200 miles off shore with nuclear weapons. I'm just, yes, I'm sort of saying if you just established a city that became a country that's floating off shore, that's heavily armed.

Speaker 3:          00:49:56       Right. So you have to ask, how are a continental nations in control of nuclear weapons? Why aren't, uh, island nations in controlled? Small island nations don't have nuclear weapons and most of them don't have standing armies. You have to pay for that stuff. Like for me to go attack someone and kill someone, there has to be a financial incentive for me that I feel like, or whatever incentives incentive of power that I feel like the cost of the invasion is going to pay back and some great thing I'm going to get like the oil or the, or any other natural

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       resource that might be within that nation. A small island nations like Hong Kong, they don't have any natural resources except a big port and they're able to create all this wealth through trade and through policies. So how does a cease dead get enough money to get a, um, to build up a giant nuclear warhead or something and launch it from the seas? Couldn't Hong Kong store to do that with all the money that Hong Kong is generated whenever they started building an army? I think that would probably be a huge issue. Don't you think if, and yet they don't because they, if you own a continental nation, you like say China, you have a control over a captive population, you can fleece, uh, and pay for whatever you want. So you have an amazing amount of capitol, brain power and money to build your nuclear weapons. And this is why these large, um, these large governments to me are much more of a threat to the world and some floating island that has to, you know, not go bankrupt as it gets started.

Speaker 5:          00:51:31       What is the major roadblock as far as technical capability of creating something along those lines? I mean, how has, has the technology been invented in order to create a safe floating city or is this completely theoretical? The key enabling technology at this point is how do you create something that can float on the high seas that is affordable by say, you know, the average middle class American and I'm, am I right also in thinking that you don't have to worry about waves like uh, as far as like rogue waves or tidal waves cause those more effect like land than they do the actual ocean itself. Like if you're floating, you just kind of like Bob up and down a lot, you wouldn't get swamped. Yeah. I think you're talking about tsunamis rogue waves. Like what was that stupid movie with Mark Mark. Perfect. Perfect. Starbucks store.

Speaker 5:          00:52:27       Yeah. Yeah, yeah. As, as tsunamis are harmless on the deep sea, people are shocked to hear that soon. Like A, a tsunami wave can literally be thousands of miles long. So if you're on a boat, you know, you, your book, over the course of a day, your boat goes up about Demeter and goes down to meet her and you can easily not notice it. Tsunamis become deadly when they hit land and they start to roll and pitch and bury a city. Uh, there was a report that I really love where there's scuba divers off the coast to some, uh, Thailand, uh, city. Uh, they were underwater, uh, just swimming around having a vacation and they say, hey, there's a weird discoloration in the water and there's a little, there's a little undulation happening. Oh, well. And they go back to scuba diving that come back to the surface. And the hotel where they ate breakfast in is destroyed. The city is destroyed, their swimming, they swam through us and I'm in and didn't notice it. So, uh, coastal cities are sitting ducks for tsunamis. If you're going to be subjected to a tsunami, you'd be safer. A sea stead.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:53:27       So those big crazy ways from a perfect storm, like if something comes,

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       so that, so that is the fundamental engineering challenge. Huge waves. On the ocean. So we have the technology to create a floating city in shallow territorial borders. And we're going to do that soon. Hopefully. Uh, the engineering challenge to be solved is how do you create permanent structures on the water, um, that, that are, that can stay out there. Like you can create boats, but the problem is boats have to come to shore every decade or two decades to get cleaned, right? You've got to have something permanent out there. And there's numerous technologies like, um, one that's been in a, um, commission been in operation since 1962 was the flip ship. It's basically shaped like a baseball bat. You tow it out into the ocean and then use ballast tanks so that it flips and then it stands up. Right? So say like one sixth of the ship of this big baseball bat is above the water and five, six is below the water and it's described as being a stable as a fence post. Uh, and these were on the water in 1962. They're still on the water. So most of it is under the water. Most of it doesn't have what he, essentially the anchor that would be the route that would be the route. And so it can sit there among the waves and you're on this thing or underwater, you can imagine looking at a window at a permanent aquarium.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       Jamie's got a photo of it that he just pulled up here. This is what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:54:52       Yeah. That's what the top part of it looks like. Oh. Uh, so most of convincing people of the potential of [inaudible] stead involves telling them about what already exists. I mean, that, that thing is older than I am. It's been around. Really? Yeah. So it's expensive. It's too expensive for regular people to use. It's used by the military. It's used by scientists. Uh, but you're seasick free on that thing. Now imagine you make four of them or three of them. You can build a platform on it. Uh, you can build floors below the ocean. You can build the floors above the ocean. So, um, of many of the C's dead designs you can see on our website are built in such a way that the, uh, it looks like they're, uh, on pillars, on like land in shallow water, but they're actually not. If you build your pillars deep enough and buoyant enough, you can set your, see stet up, say, you know, 50 feet from the surface of the ocean and the ocean waves are moving underneath the sea stead and its remit remaining relatively stable, uh, on these pillars that are just in water.

Speaker 3:          00:56:03       And the pillars go down much further than you would normally think. It's kind of like building a foundation in a swamp

Speaker 4:          00:56:12       saw something where they made it so they figured out a way to make things so stable that they, you can play billiards on a, on a boat. They figured out a way to stabilize like a pool table to the point where it reacts instantaneously to the movement of the ocean and the ship itself where you can see it stays constantly balanced.

Speaker 3:          00:56:34       Yeah. There's so much I can tell you about. I mean, I wrote on a cruise ship and Alaskan cruise ship and a month ago I was on a Galapagos cruise ship and you can have your Martini glass, you pour the Martini glass, you set it on the table. It's not, you know, it's not rolling over. It's like the larger you make your C's dead, the more stable it is in the waves. Those bolts are kind of see steads, right? I mean if you really think about it, well that's the precedent we use is to get people thinking about cruise ships. I mean, they're the size of skyscrapers. I mean, you can look at pictures on the Internet and realize those tiny little answer people and everything people do in cities they're already doing on cruise ships, you know, simulated skydiving. They have rock concerts on them.

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       Yeah. Here's this video of these guys playing pool on a cruise ship and the boat is moving, but yet the balls are, are rolling perfectly because the, the ship, if he could see the ship is moving, but the table stays completely level. So it adjusts with the, the movement of the ocean. The table consistently constantly adjusts so that the floor may be moving but the balls are never rolling and I incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:57:45       That is incredible. And that would obviously be on like a smaller boat where it's not naturally stable anyway because I've been in cruise ships where people are playing pool, you know, you can't even tell you on the water. But if you think about the sinking of that Russian sub, uh, you know, they had to find a company to lift that thing off the water without causing off the bottom of the ocean without causing a disaster. Glo Mar situation, uh, this was a long time ago. It was a few years ago, I think it was called the [inaudible]. And the company is called Memo Matt, I don't know how to pronounce these things because they're in different languages, but they had to lift this thing centimeter by centimeter. And they had to do, they had to create a platform on the top of the water and create virtually perfect stability while while they lifted this thing slowly off the Bot, you know, a nuclear sub off the bottom of the, uh, of the, uh, of the ocean, uh, in order to lift it up.

Speaker 3:          00:58:39       And it was a tremendous engineering feat. Um, we can go on and on like this and we might bore your listeners, but there are multiple technologies that are all closing in on, hey, we can get something permanent on the sea. And it looks like, um, Shell is gonna is gonna build one soon. So the, the question is, now how do we make it cheaper? How do we attract more brains to this? How do we get a kind of x prize, uh, attracting people to solve this engineering challenge? I think once we solve this challenge, seasteading will, will drive itself.

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       Shell is going to build one and they're building an oil refinery that floats. Is that what the want?

Speaker 3:          00:59:19       Yeah. Uh, and it's not, they're not calling it a see stead, but it will be, you know, 200 miles off the coast of Australia. Uh, it's built in like South Korea and it's bigger than the empire state building. You can fit several football fields on it and it's going to be in international waters for up to 25 years. So pretty much any time a city is it, I mean, think of it as like a giant, uh, I'd like a giant skyscraper on the water. Will be reasonably self sustaining or is, is it going to rely on constant visits by, by freighter ships? Like all ships in islands, everywhere. It requires on constant visits and trade and, but this is like, they don't think of it as an independent country. They think of it as a shell prelude fling facility. I'll give the size of that thing.

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       It's gigantic. Um, bigger than the empire state building. Yeah, more massive. And see if I can remember how many football fields on it you could play. I think it's five like football games in a row. So it's, it's doable. It's just still too expensive. The shell can afford that and they can, and they can pay it back. So our skyscrapers, right. I mean, you and I can't go out and build a scotch grabber. Right. But we could, if we had a great idea for a business that would work a board of floating skyscraper, like, like a gigantic hospital, um, uh, floating Cayman Islands. You know, one of my heroes, uh, who's building a health city in the Cayman Islands is named a Debby Shetti. Uh, he did create name. Yeah. He's a, he's an Indian guy and he did amazing stuff with, you know, he'll offer Americans, uh, heart surgery for one 10th the price with the best doctors, and that makes them enough money where he can offer a medical insurance to rural Indians, uh, for 25 cents a month.

Speaker 3:          01:01:15       So he plays this kind of jurisdictional arbitrage. So now he's moving to the Cayman Islands and building what are called health cities ready to catch the wiving, the rising wave of Americans who are going to be dissatisfied with their healthcare and when a faster, quicker and cheaper and we'll fly there. And I, I've been looking at him as a guy that seems like he understands what seasteading would be. He seems to understand the principles and he's applying them by using real islands. And I've always fantasized if I could talk to him and get him to like invest in a cced dead. And you know, I almost peed my pants a few months ago where he was in the news and he said, you know, the best place to have a floating hospital would be on a ship, you know, off the coast of a major American city. Given that we don't have that, I'm going to build one in the Cayman Islands. And I'm like, oh my God. Like there's so many people thinking along these lines. Like, if we could just, we have innovations and technologies moving forward and we have regulatory structures and government's holding it back and the world can't be held back. The world has to move forward. Well, you don't want to overthrow governments that's violent. You want to innovate and compete with and embarrass governments the way you know Singapore and Hong Kong and the island man have done

Speaker 4:          01:02:32       well. And I'm on a small scale. When you see certain laws that are in place that are um, very restrictive and they don't make sense. And then you see states that take chances like Colorado with their medical marijuana practices or rather a legal marijuana where they're making untold amounts of money. Now, I mean far past what they projected. And now other countries are starting to look at the revenue that's being brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. And they're saying, you know what? This is, why would we avoid this? This is crazy. Like what are we seeing as far as violence? What we're seeing a drop in violent crime? What are we seeing as far as drunk driving and driving accidents? We're seeing record lows, record lows as far as like traffic fatalities and drunk driving. Why aren't you know? That's exactly what happens. Someone comes along and says, listen, the laws that are in place, they don't make any sense.

Speaker 4:          01:03:23       The the structure that's in place, it's, it's antiquated, it's archaic and it doesn't match up with what we know about medicine, what we know about physiology, what we know about life. Let's change it. So they're changing it and you've seen the benefits and now all these other states are now first switching to medical marijuana and projecting legalized marijuana all throughout the entire country. It's the same sort of a situation. It's, it's these archaic, very restrictive laws that don't make any sense and there's no competition because of the monopoly of government. These laws are in place and people say, well, you could vote him out. Do you know how many much fucking money is spent keeping those laws in place? Do you know how many people lobby the prison guard unions, pharmaceutical companies, et Cetera, et cetera. So many different companies lobbying and spend millions of dollars of money to keep the laws in place. If you could have one state, just one state, you know, let's say South Dakota says, you know what, we're not so happy with the way things work. Well, we're going to do is we're going to open up South Dakota to a complete Utopian society. We're going to just start from scratch instead of seasteading wants to come over to South Dakota and Char tribe rebuilding society over here. Would you be interested in something like that or do you think the only way to do this is to do it in the ocean? Uh, I

Speaker 3:          01:04:38       ran my first podcast last week and I interviewed, uh, Zachary because Sarah's who welcome to the club, you know, welcome to the pod class clown. Yeah. First one is my first one you got in there and it was a marvelous interview. He's a fascinating dude and he founded the startup cities institute. Now, uh, the special economic zones, there's actually thousands of them all over the world is places like India, South America, China are all like, yeah, it's embarrassing to be in a country that's not performing well. Let's create special little zones where we can start over with new rules. And there's, you know, they're called free cities, they're called free ports. So, you know, Zach has been, um, pushing for pushing the F uh, in Guatemala. The idea of the Morse free cities, you can create, the more innovation you can create, the more, uh, uh, wealth you can create for poor people if they choose to move there and take the jobs.

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       And our whole discussion was, which is a bigger challenge, the, the engineering challenge of building something on the sea or the challenge of working at a deal with existing comp, uh, governments and, and asking them for a piece of their land. Right. Um, and some of these places have been very successful, you know, Shinzen across the bay from Hong Kong, given the example that Hong Kong set, you know, China agreed to create a little special economic zone called Shinzen and you know, creating, once again, spectacular wealth. So now they've allowed more of these experiments. So the way you know, in industry isn't working as if you have to argue about it. You know, in our arguments don't matter. Our, our experiments matter. And the reason we have to argue about politics is because it's not innovating and everyone is frustrated. And the more startups societies we can create, um, the more we'll empower innovators to come up with ideas. We haven't thought of. The best solutions always come from outside our, our heads. So I'm a big supporter of startup cities. Startup cities are people that are a big supporter of seasteading and you know, may the best societies when, hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:06:42       Um, but your idea is primarily to build it in the ocean and if you do build in the ocean, what, what are the potential natural disaster worries you have to worry about? If you don't have to worry about waves, you do have to worry about like things like hurricanes and things like that. Right? Would you have to engineer the building's very specifically to deal with tropical storms and things along those lines?

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       See steads our mobile, uh, the people that are, that are sitting ducks in the face of a hurricane or is anyone that's like nailed to a, to a coastal nation and he's cities, all the mega cities in the world are springing up along the coast and many of them are susceptible to hurricanes. If you're a cease dead, uh, you know, I grew up in the east coast, I was subjected to a few hurricanes, you know, about them a few days before they come and then it's battened down the hatches, get in the basement, you know, whatever you have to do if you're a c stayed, you could potentially just move out of the way as boats do.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       So you would just, I mean there's some of them that are just massive though. I mean there's, there's like Katrina, I mean, how many states was Katrina? How many states wide was Katrina before it hit? It was enormous.

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       Is enormous. And I'm curious to know, um, how much, how much lead time did people have in the warning of that you're leading me to talk about, you know, I have to get bigger and bigger with w c sittings a big subject. And the thing I want to tell you about now is we'll start with the fact that hurricanes don't cross the equator. A lot of people don't know that, uh, there's never been evidence of a hurricane crossing the acquaintance south to north across the other one. Like going, yeah, you mean like go along the vertical access to the equator or go above it, go above the equator or go below the equator. Really? Yeah. Why is that a, I don't know. The coal, the role is for, I have no idea. But um, so there's this Guy Patrick Takahashi who's like a biochemical engineer from Hawaii and numerous people like that are pushing forward this technology called Otec, e c a and it's basically ocean thermal energy conversion.

Speaker 3:          01:08:46       And it basically takes advantage of the fact that the surface of a tropical ocean is very warm and a thousand feet down. It's very cold. And you get like a huge temperature differential, which can drive a gigantic steam engine and basically use the ocean itself as a solar panel, uh, to, you know, power and ocean city or an ocean plant ship as he calls it. And also power the land based nations of the world. We can completely replace a fossil fuels, um, with a clean green renewable energy of Otec. Does it sound futuristic? Uh, they built a working one in 1979 during the Carter administration, uh, as it was part of the oil crisis. And then soon after that when oil prices fell, Otec was abandoned. No more OTEC plants were built. Now there's a whole company's involved with building Otec. They're going to build one off the coast of China.

Speaker 3:          01:09:40       Numerous, uh, island nations have commissioned, um, uh, OTEC plants to be built off their coasts. The Bahamas is going to build to, so why did I go to this? We're talking about hurricanes crawling quarter. Yeah. So the best place to build these gigantic Otec plants is on the equator. Cause that's where the surface water is warm mist. And as an added benefit, you're safe from hurricanes for the most part. So the equator itself, how wide is the equator? Like what's considered the equator? I mean it's not a line, right? Yeah, it's, it's a, it's, it's where the, you know, the earth spins on its axis and it's where it's basically the earth that spends the most time closest to the sun. Uh, uh, you know, there must be a height though, right? Yeah, that's a good question. It's funny, I was just at the equator when I went to the Galapagos islands on my little trip and, uh, I don't think there's an official width, uh, of the equator, you know, I have no idea or height and it seems like there should be, yeah, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       I think it's just the line where the earth's spends the most time closest to the sun. You know, everywhere else we have seasons because the earth is on a wobble. It has length, no width or depth. That makes sense. A line. It's just a very fine line with no hide at all. It's an abstraction. A strange, so you'd have to like be on that line. What if you went up too high? One of like the northern tip of your sitting at fucked by a hurricane. I mean, that could happen because a lot of, you know, a lot of hurricanes are caused by, you know, very warm water and put some still bizarre that it would not cross. Yeah. Like starts, you know, sort of near the equator and then it moves either north or South. Wow. That's so weird. Yeah. And I don't understand why I'm, I'm just, uh, it's one of those things I've been taught by the numerous aquaponic or as I've spoken to the thing that makes seasteading that shows that it's a Meta idea is all the diverse people that come to seasteading.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       What their unique solution that no one who talked about seasteading is thought of. Um, you know, on the, on the website we have this thing called the eight great moral imperatives of seasteading and each of them, it's a little video thing that I made to try to introduce people to the key ideas. Each video is like five minutes long. And each of them features and Aquaponic, sure. That didn't even know about the other guys. But here's about seasteading and comes to us with, I have an idea for this seaweed farm and this is how we could lower the carbon acidity of the ocean and I could do this on a massive scale and blah, blah, blah, blah. And then we have another guy, you know, one of my favorites is a Neil sims who, who, who runs the Velella, uh, research project. He has, um, fish cages that a school with the moving fish.

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       So he literally see if I can describe this to you. Think of the Hawaiian islands as, um, rocks in a stream. And as the ocean comes by the islands, it creates a little eddies behind these islands, like little leaf floating around. So he's got these circular fish cages where he keeps the fish inside them. So the fish just kind of school in a circle and the, the cages move with the schooling fish around in a circle and you, and he has a gps on the cage. So the fish are out there. There's no environmental or negligible unmeasured on measurable environmental impact. The Fisher on the deep sea living as if they're wild. Um, these are crazy ideas and, but they require, uh, being out in the place where there is no government jurisdiction for the most part. I mean off the coast of Hawaiian islands, there is some government jurisdiction, but we have, you know, 45% of the world's surface unclaimed by existing, uh, governments where people are innovating in these unique ways to feed the world with sustainable sashimi on the deep oceans.

Speaker 3:          01:13:31       Is the idea of managing people just an archaic idea and is what you're saying, what you're talking about when you're talking about micromanaging the government, trying to manage all these things and in fact fucking them up with too many regulations. Is it impossible to really regulate human behavior and it's at a certain point or to really regulate, especially when it comes to things like innovation when it comes to, uh, I mean is our regulations, in fact, roadblocks to innovation, the creativity of 7 billion people is unpredictable. And there's always something new coming, especially as a c center where people come to me and tell me about things that could use seasoning for him. Like I had no idea, I can't believe you're telling me this is very exciting. So I've had to embrace my humility that I don't understand what's coming. So people are afraid, people want regulations and rather than take a position on whether we need regulations or not, we should all agree that the way to create sound regulations is not to simply create a monopoly that has permanent control over any particular industry and writes a bunch of rules, passes a bunch of laws, accumulating thousands and thousands of more laws.

Speaker 3:          01:14:39       And you know, those, those more laws don't keep pace with Moore's law to make upon, I mean, we have, uh, thousands, tens of thousands of regulations written in the 70s that are still constraining innovation and those people were not capable of predicting innovations that we're going to come in the 21st century. So if you want regulations, you need them as organic and dynamic as the industries they regulate. Right? But how does that work?

Speaker 4:          01:15:06       I mean, how does anyone calculate the sort of regulations to, especially an incredibly fluid and dynamic industry, the technology industry that most people like say if you're trying to regulate, you know, certain aspects of cell phone development. Most people just are just not qualified to understand them. They just don't know what they're talking about, right? You're talking about something that's changing year to year. If you, if you, uh, made regulations as far as the development of cell phones back when the Motorola Startac was state of the art and he tried to apply those same innovations today with the Samsung galaxy s five. I mean, Holy Shit, you're dealing with a completely different animal. One of them is essentially a computer that could run your whole life and check your heart rate and do all kinds of nutty shit. Locate it's got a gps on it and can tell you where to go and navigate you. And the other one was just a simply a way to call people,

Speaker 3:          01:16:01       right? And the, the humility. We have to embrace this. We don't know, right? We don't know how to regulate the future. Uh, and so if you, if you confront the fact there is no human being that can pre irregulate the innovations that are happening in a decade, you, you realize that the way to solve these problems is not to simply create a permanent monopoly that you know, rights. What may more way more laws than it, than it allows to go away. You need to break up those monopolies. You need a competing jurisdictions. If, uh, uh, sort of like a, I think of it as fluidly overlapping, uh, um, uh, a market of developing regulations on the ocean, uh, initiated by the industries. And we see this in lots of other industries where regulations develop over time from within. A lot of people don't know that a lot of the things we take for granted, aspirin, a knee operations, lots of heart surgeries, they just came from the ground from, from, from doctors experimenting.

Speaker 3:          01:17:05       Um, so every country goes through this cycle. It's, it's such a constant cycle that it's actually a cold. What is it called? Cardwell's law. There's like an official name for it that you start out with these blossoming industries. Uh, there's some disaster that happens that causes regulation. In the case of medicine, it was the thalidomide scandal that happened, you know, decades ago. So then these regulations come in place to protect people from disasters. But by creating a monopoly of regulation production, the regulations just accumulate and accumulate and none of them ever go away. So you, the, the, uh, the bureaucracy rides on this wave of innovation and then it starts dragging it down because there's just no incentive for the regulators to cut back on their regulations and you ended up killing the goose that lays the golden egg. But essentially

Speaker 4:          01:17:58       the balancing act is between safety and innovation. Right? That's the balancing act when, especially when you talk about things like thalidomide, um, how do you, how do you sort of manage that? How do you manage the balancing act of safety and innovation? Because in the, in terms of especially some untested medical procedure, like I have a friend who, um, got a stroke from Vioxx was some, some, uh, arthritis medication. And you know, I was a young guy. He got a stroke. It's pretty crazy. And they pulled it off the market and now it's illegal and it was lawsuits and all this jazz. But what, what do you do to ensure that one of those things, uh, the, the most beneficial, whether it's like the most beneficial, innovative, uh, technology arises or do you, you know, err on the side of caution at all costs and make sure that no one becomes a victim of some emerging idea that hasn't been vetted out yet? The,

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       we have a monopoly. They ere strongly in the side of the precautionary principle. So the, the, uh, regulators are in an impossible position. They have no way of evaluating all the new stuff that, that comes online. Uh, they don't, they just don't have the resources. So they have to do it in consultation with the dominant industries who invariably lean them towards, uh, you know, don't allow this innovation through. What if a disaster happens and regulators are blamed for disasters and they don't get credit for through all the innovations that come, I'm

Speaker 4:          01:19:27       through. But on the flip side, aren't the people that are coming up with these innovations, wouldn't they try to influence them to any regulatory body to let them slide through because he's be extremely profitable and wouldn't they say, hey, you know, this is all safe when maybe in fact it hasn't. And how them, there've been a bunch of different medications that have been released onto the mark of it turned out like I remember, um, fen phen you remember that show people? Uh, I remember this girl, she was about, she was a pretty girl, but she was like, man, I'm 30 pounds plus overweight. And then one time I saw her and it wasn't that long. It was, you know, a few months later and all of a sudden she's as skinny little bombshell. Yeah. I like, what the fuck is going

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       on? I'm like, what'd you do? Oh, I'm on phen phen six months later, heart problems, all these health issues. She balloons up again. But I guess I would on Finfin too. Yes, it was. It wasn't easy, but we should confront the fact like our minds always go to this bad story. And so we see the thalidomide baby right from the 60s, but we don't see the tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands and some estimate even more than that, that have died as the result of medical innovations that are available, uh, often in other countries and are already approved that are not approved say in the United States. Right. Uh, so we don't need to, you and I are not going to agree on a balancing act and impose it on the world, but we should recognize that there's a cycle, that it starts out being protective and then it becomes over protective and then it prevents and quashes innovation.

Speaker 3:          01:21:00       And when it's a monopoly, it never innovate. It never stops writing new rules. And once it's controlled by dominant interests, uh, new people that don't have $1 billion or 10 years to wait to get their drugs through the process. And that is the, the conservative estimate. 10 years. Yeah, 10 years. Um, so all sorts of new players innovating and interesting spaces, like for instance, in stem cells, uh, are not able to, uh, compete. So we don't get the innovations that they have. So there should be some regulation. There should be something and it shouldn't just be the market decides. It shouldn't just be, you know, we'll let when people start dying and people stop using it and then, you know, now we know you can't. It can't be that, right? I mean, the more time goes by, the more I'm impressed with the power of the market to, to regulate itself.

Speaker 3:          01:21:50       But in terms of medical things, I mean, the people will become victims. I mean, the market will regulate itself, but is, are you, are you comfortable making that, that distinction? I think right now we're victims of being denied the innovations that are available that will let her held up or preventing innovators from discovering new things. Um, and you know, if you, you know, the same reason you put out a product that isn't poison and you put effort into your, um, podcasts at the beginning to assure people, I want to build a relationship with you, and if you don't like it, I'm going to give you your money back. That's, that's a kind of regulation. Like you're incentivized to provide a good service. If you put something out to kill somebody, you're in a, you're in a lot of trouble. And I think people underestimate the power of that kind of market force to incentivize people to not poison their patients. I agree with you. But then even with all the regulation in place, you still have this doctor Oz type situation. You still have someone who's profiting off of something that doesn't do Jack Shit and is on television calling it a miracle. Yeah. You know, so I've been waiting for Doctor Oz to go down and I, I'd be, I'd be curious, which came first was it was, uh, a journalist, uh, exposing him and then, uh, governments came in and snapped him down. I don't know what happened. I mean, our idea is always that

Speaker 4:          01:23:15       it's doctors, it's A. Dot. It was actually a medical student that chased it down. There was a whole article about it that was on, um, here, I'll pull it up. Medical student.

Speaker 3:          01:23:26       So that, that, if that's true, that's an example of a market regulation that occurred.

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Right. But how many people got fleeced before that happened? Meet the medical student who wants to bring down Doctor Oz. This is the guy, um, who, uh, his name is Benjamin Maser and Benjamin Maser is a, the student that saw, I guess he was watching all these different claims and he's like, this is all horse shit. So he, um, he chased it down.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       Yeah. And Doctor Oz. I mean, he's a good example of the point I'm trying to make. I mean, he's in a regulatory structure. He's completely ensconced and what he was doing wasn't stopped. It took, uh, someone, you know, coming from the ground up and analyzing and himself probably a competitor and exposing them as a fraud. I don't know if it's hurt his career. Um, but I'm sure people are reacting against him. This is a good thing. So we're describing, uh, the essence of a market regulation right here. I has the, has anyone from the government come in and find Doctor Oz? Has he been imprisoned?

Speaker 4:          01:24:29       Well, I know he was brought in front of Congress. Aha. Yeah, it was a, it was a big story. It was all over the news, but he was, uh, uh, on that, uh, what's that show? Um, the new HBO show, the gentleman with the glasses, John Oliver, John Oliver did a whole piece on, uh, on Doctor Oz and Dr Oz being brought in front of Congress and Doctor Oz saying one thing on his television show and then saying completely contradictory there. Dr Oz grilled and Congress had missed admits weight loss products. He touts don't pass scientific muster.

Speaker 3:          01:25:04       So we're, we're looking at, I mean, we're looking at examples of market regulation. Uh, I'm not even going to take a hard stance that we don't need any, uh, regulations by, you know, a central authority. I'm maybe going to take a hard stance on that. I'm asking people to look at the power of these kinds of things to regulate itself. And the problem with, uh, just accumulating thousands and thousands of rules that prevent anyone from trying something new. And that's the situation we're in.

Speaker 4:          01:25:34       Yeah. I mean, I'm not a big government guy. I'm not a fan of big fan of government, but it's just the devil's advocate position I think has to be sort of addressed in these sort of scenarios because I think there is the potential for fuckery. And it's like how do you protect citizens from things that they're not entirely educated in? What laws do you establish that protect people from someone? Victimizing someone with some sort of an unproven product. Like, you know, bad luck, job medicine that leaves people crippled. There's, there's that out there. Yeah. How do you deal with that and this seasteading world and how do you keep, you know, how do you keep order?

Speaker 3:          01:26:15       Well, it's the same way. It's the same reason I don't put out a book with no words in it. And you don't put out a podcast with just a bunch of Farts, right? Uh, yeah. I mean, we, we don't have monopoly control over what we do. There's other authors competing to get you to read their books. There's other podcasters competing to get me to listen to them and I listened to you instead. Uh, it's not about standing is not about here's the list of rules we're going to impose on the ocean. It's confronting human nature and there's always potential for fuckery. People do shitty things. And the way to solve that problem is not to just take some of those shitty people and give them absolute power over everybody else. And then they promised to make everyone behave better. Uh, I think governments will evolve and innovations will occur if there's decentralized power among multiple people who can only profit and be selfish by finding ways to serve and please each other. And that includes producing regulations by which we behave.

Speaker 4:          01:27:17       That's fascinating. So what you're essentially doing is you're providing a method for new civilizations to innovate. You're not proposing any sort of guidelines. You're not proposing any sort of a new structure for government, new structure for finances. What you're doing is you, you are sort of opening up the door and allowing a wide variety of people to come through and allow the best ideas to float to the top.

Speaker 3:          01:27:49       Yeah. Seasteading is not about seizing power from your political opponents. It's about seeding power to your political opponents to try their ideas elsewhere, to see if they can create something that will surprise you. And you can laugh at the fiascos if you want. Uh, but the more experiments, the more likely we are to discover solutions. And that's, that's the truth of politics. You know, society is more complex than this microphone. I can't design this microphone. Uh, but I think I can design society through my political opinions and the only tool I have to do that is for. So that forces me to fight over who's going to control the government, to force other people who disagree with me to do what I want. I don't think anyone knows how to run society. I think the solutions to humanity's deepest challenges are discovered, uh, and they're discovered by lots of people trying lots of crazy ideas.

Speaker 4:          01:28:43       Well, I think one of the big issues in society is what I call the quantity of variables is that when you have a very small group of people, the variables are not that large. And you can handle 20 people. If we had a relationship with um, 19 other folks and we were all living together on a, you know, a large patch of land that had a good amount of natural resources where that no one had to worry about starving and death. Why someone else lived high on the hog. If everyone was even with the distribution of natural resources and wouldn't be that hard, they wouldn't be a lot of conflict. The real conflict comes when you have a quantity of variables when you have 350 million people and then you have things like immigration, you have things like the stock market, you know, the things like do you know weird things that go down in terms of loans and terms of credit cards and there's so many variables that that's when it becomes incredibly difficult to manage a society when no one person can be aware of all the variables. The quantity of variables gets outside of the realm of comprehension.

Speaker 5:          01:29:52       Yes. And everything that works out well for us is outside the realm of comprehension. I, I could not possibly make this table or that water bottle or that computer. You can make this table. I know the dude made it. It's not that hard. Okay. Well I wouldn't know where to get the wood. I wouldn't know how to make it. So there's no varnish. This is raw. That's why it's called coffee stains. Yeah. You could, uh, you could figure this out, but I know what you're saying. I wouldn't be able to make, you wouldn't be able to make the microphone. Yes. I think you make the table. I couldn't make the microphone. You're a smart dude. And uh, I appreciate how the solutions, uh, emerge. They're not, you know, imposed by somebody. They emerge from the kind of global ecology of voluntary transactions that produce the solutions.

Speaker 5:          01:30:34       And the more people you have trying different things, the more peacefully they can pick compete in the market, the more likely these solutions already would emerge. And we need to update the governance, the technology of governance, just like other technologies. And we can't do that through monopolies. Is this something that you do full time? I do it full time. You're involved in seasteading fulltime? Yes, and it's the first real job I've ever had. So I've always been a writer. I tell stories. I started out as a novelist. I eventually became a science writer once I was captivated by the seasteading story. Once I met the people I called Aqua panners with all their ideas, I realize this is the most important story I could possibly tell. Uh, so I, you know, I've written the book, it's going to come out next year about seasteading, but I, I got, I became such a sea Vangelis I talked about it so much.

Speaker 5:          01:31:26       You have so many of those blue jobs. See Evangelist. Yeah. Aqua openers. Yeah. I'm a professional bullshit artists. The nerds in Silicon Valley need me to sell their shit to the, to the, to real people. Um, so they kind of brought me on to the seasteading institute to talk about seasteading. I, you know, they were smart enough to see that I'm driven by it and I'm passionate about it. So, you know. And where does your money come from, if you don't mind me asking? Well now I'm working for a nonprofit and I, I, I'm a paid speaker and a nonprofit is seasteading seasteading institute, which was founded by Peter Teal and Pantry Friedman. So you get paid to evangelize, see setting, essentially I get paid to, you know, do lots of things with regard to the nonprofit. Um, and the money comes from donations be money comes from donations.

Speaker 5:          01:32:18       So we have over a thousand donors or a thousand people who have donated. Uh, and we have hundreds of volunteers that have gotten involved and we have probably 85 ambassadors. Uh, W I'm getting so many ambassador applications right now. I can't keep up with it. I want to be an ambassador. Yeah, you, you should be, you shouldn't serve on our board or something. So imagine that kind of time. Imagine a regular middle class person who donates money to the seasteading institute. I mean, people get infected with this idea. They realize it. Rather than arguing about my political, my particular political problem, I go deeper and realize it's the structure itself that we just don't have the innovations. We just don't have, um, a numerous people experimenting with new ideas. We got to, we got to go deeper and, and, and hit restart on multiple small governments, micro countries on the sea, and we'll discover solutions we're not imagining now, just like the United States discovered solutions that were not in the imaginations of monarchists in previous centuries.

Speaker 5:          01:33:24       So explain to me how this works. Like if someone says, I think she's studying is a good idea. Is there a Kickstarter page? Is there, uh, do you have a paypal link? I mean, how does someone donate to this where it winds up being your income? We have a donation page on the website. Uh, every time we send out our newsletter to our fans, we put a little donation link there. We accept bitcoin. Um, it's, it's pretty easy to donate to the seasteading institute if that's what you want to do if you go to the website and are inspired by it. And what is the website? A seasteading.org and uh, you know, I strongly recommend checking out the eight grade moral imperatives, which is one of the problems the seasteading institute has had is that it's been very technical and it's talking to, you know, aquatic engineers and there's legal scholars talking about stuff and people go and they're kind of overwhelmed by the information and they don't know where to start.

Speaker 5:          01:34:18       So I've tried to popularize the idea and create, you know, eight little videos explaining just the basic angles from which people are approaching seasteading to solve global challenges that people care about. So the eight great moral imperatives you have as a video on seasteading and what is a, it's only a minute, right? Each one is probably about five minutes on average. Uh, the introduction is a minute, the introduction is a minute. And then you can click on any of the eight and it's, and it's a list of things like, do you, what do you see? If you name me something you care about, I can tell you about an aqua Opendoor that's trying to solve that problem. Well, let's click on the link. Jamie, go to the eight great moral imperatives

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       and let's just play the introduction. Um, if you just Google the eight great moral imperatives, it'll show up. It's the first, uh, the first link, but it's on seasteading.org and there is a 53 second video that will, uh, sort of, uh, introduced this idea. Got It. That that is the issue, right? Moral imperatives.

Speaker 3:          01:35:22       That's the issue. We got to get down past the divisive political language and just talk about human values that, you know, conservatives, liberals, Libertarians and anarchists and everyone else shares for the most part. Let's hear this.

Speaker 6:          01:35:36       When we listened to the sea, we know what our moral imperatives are. Feed the hungry, enrich the poor here, the sick, clean the atmosphere, restore the oceans. Live in balance with nature, power, civilization sustainably. Stop fighting. I want to tell you about eight aqua up honeymooners who plan to fulfill these moral imperatives by building floating cities on the seat. Click on the issue you care about below and maybe we can convince you to join our growing seasteading community.

Speaker 4:          01:36:18       What is the timeline on, on implementing this sort of a thing? Like, if you had to be realistic and you had to make an estimate as to fuck how long between now and when there really is a floating civilization.

Speaker 3:          01:36:35       I've been, I've enjoyed. Um, well, one way we can think about it is when do we have to get one of these things going? Uh, and I was very impressed that the aqua partners, I interviewed like six of them, independently cited 20, 50, uh, as a time where this is where we're going to run out of fresh water. Uh, this is when we're going to run out of phosphate. This is where we're going to reach peak oil. You know, whatever people say. And you know, I'm not qualified to judge whether 20, 50 really is a deadline for humanity, like a pinch point. And in several, uh, key commodities, humanity needs to survive. But so let's say we have no choice but to find solutions to global problems by 2050 and say, I'm saying we can solve these problems by engaging the power of the sea.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       Uh, so that's, that's the timeline. So I think, I hope by 2020 we'll have a demonstration. A see stead within the territorial waters of a, of a host nation. And if we can hire some local people, create some blue jobs, absorb a costal runoff, uh, and turn that into algae, that'll attract more ideas. Um, I'm hoping maybe, you know, you can imagine 20, 35 you have something on the deeper ocean. People come up with a break water. We have people contacting us right now about you can create a solid break water too to protect a city. Some nice. Yeah, I'd have to be an incredibly cold environment and apparently not. Apparently you can get one in the tropical oceans. I'm not even going to go into detail on this. I'm using this as an example of like qualified engineers that are coming to us with ideas for how to, how to do this on the Osha.

Speaker 3:          01:38:12       So you would use solar power to power some sort of a freezing element that no, apparently I, I'll have to point you to his, his proposal. I mean, apparently ice can sit for a very long time if it's solid enough in even in tropical borders, but, but whatever, it's just one idea. I like the Otec idea using the ocean as a solar panel to replace fossil fuels. Uh, a key idea to think about, uh, ocean crops. So something to think about. 70% of the world's fresh water is used for agriculture between like a quarter and a half of all land is used for agriculture. Where we're, we've depleted the top soil, we're using up the freshwater populations are going up, we're facing a water crisis by 2050. Then you think about the fact that a algae crops, uh, see farms require no fresh water whatsoever. They require no soil whatsoever. Uh, and we haven't actually reached pizza peak phosphate.

Speaker 3:          01:39:11       We've just taken it out of the soil and dumped it into the oceans. Well, what absorbs, uh, all these nutrients that are the oceans? Well, uh, algae farms, so we can park. A lot of people are opposing that. We park a algae farms around the dead zones off the coast of, of various cities in the world. Absorb all that nutrient and carbon pollution, turn it into food and fuel over the long haul. Um, that's just one problem. Be Heavy metals though. I mean, when you have you met artisan problem, things along those lines, like you would, you would be feeding that to people. You can't extract that. Well, you can't extract it. Apparently there's people trying things with muscles and various natural organisms that remove these things from, from uh, um, you know, there's the, it's weird how many like bacteria and small little creatures process this stuff and people are talking about we need to farm on that level.

Speaker 3:          01:40:04       We need to farm on these tiny little levels. So you would get some sort of organisms that take out the heavy metals and then the other organisms would eat the carbon right and turn that into fuel. Well, people are trying to create these, um, you know, cyclical little systems. They're already doing it on a small scale, you know, involving muscles that, that uh, um, you know, filter feeders. W with this kind of fish, with this kind of algae, algae haven't undergone all the artificial selection that makes wheat, corn and soy so productive and get allergies a lot healthier. And a lot of people react and they say, eh, algae, I don't want to eat that. Uh, but most people don't know that algae is already in most of the foods we eat. It. It's, it's a fertilizer that nourishes the land crops we use. It's in toothpaste, it's in beer, it's an ice cream.

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       You know, Carrageenan and Aguilar, and I don't even know how to pronounce all these aspects of then seaweed as well. The seaweed is, is huge. Um, and it's very healthy and it's very healthy. It has a, it's probably the healthiest plant in the world. It has all the amino acids, depending on the species. A has a lot of fiber. You know, fish don't synthesize their own Omega threes. They get it by eating algae. Um, and when you consider that, you know, corn was this tiny little ugly thing that no one wanted to eat. Wheat is this, if you showed someone a wheat stalk, they'd say, I don't want to eat that. Uh, but you just a few generations of artists, official selection, you can create all this marvelous stuff. We'd, uh, we can do the same thing with, uh, with algae that we're already using in our foods.

Speaker 3:          01:41:41       And, uh, you know, the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation helped, uh, Ricardo Radulovich, the founder of the Sea Gordon's project. He's big on creating, he wants to create a seaweed farms on the sea. He mixed a seaweed flower with wheat flour, uh, sending it to the developing world. It does a lot for malnutrition among those people. There's so many ways you can use the healthier plants at the sea to feed people. Uh, and, and you don't need to use fresh water. Uh, so a lot of people say agriculture needs to become aquaculture and we can give, you know, Kansas back to the songbirds.

Speaker 4:          01:42:24       That's funny. Um, that's, uh, it's a fascinating idea, the idea of seasteading and um, it's, it's also fascinating to try to reverse the process that we've already begun as far as destroying the oceans as far as the amount of pollution that were leaking into the ocean, as if that could actually benefit some life forms in some sort of way. And then we could sort of turn that back around and get something out of it. And that way.

Speaker 3:          01:42:48       Yeah. I mean [inaudible] has been the keystone of the global carbon cycle, you know, for three and a half billion years, you know, it knows what it's doing. And we've been working against the carbon cycle and just like screwing up the whole planet, we can turn that wheel back around. If we base our food on, on the ocean,

Speaker 4:          01:43:04       I've read something about dumping scrap iron into the ocean to reaction Jane oxygenate the Ocean because dumping scrap iron to the ocean, it would serve as a base for algae to start growing on.

Speaker 3:          01:43:16       Yes. So Patrick Takahashi and others propose that for the OTEC supported plant ships that you, you might have to seed some iron. I mean, there's ways this have to be tweaked and when we get to this level of detail, I just refer you to, you know, the experts who were talking about it and we never know what's going to work. You know, all these people are thinking about these ideas, experimenting with them on a small scale. All this hopeless or hopeful stuff is going on like what you just described. And the idea is we need to open up this frontier for people to experiment on. We need to allow the ocean, uh, to, to let civilization. We need to base civilization on the ocean because the fact that so much of it, it's such a resource. The ocean, uh, you know, most of the oxygen comes from the ocean. Life comes from the ocean.

Speaker 4:          01:44:06       Most of the oxygen comes from the ocean as far as like, like you mean seep seaweed and things like that?

Speaker 3:          01:44:14       Yeah. I mean, seaweed forest make the world's rain forests look like potted plants is what I always say. When you consider like the amount of carbon they store, the amount of oxygen they produce. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:44:29       I know. I had no idea. I had always assumed it was just forest.

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       No, it's mostly, uh, ocean crops that, uh, keep the world in balance. And the more, the more you, uh, forest the oceans with say, seaweed crops, the more carbon to build their bio mass, they have to pull this carbon and nutrient out of the water, which lowers the acidity of the ocean, which is exactly what we need to do. The more carbon you pull out of the ocean, the more, uh, uh, carbon the oceans pulls out of the air. Um, so you could reverse the whole carbon problem by just creating a massive seaweed farms on the ocean. And people have calculated about how much he would need. And it'd be the size of this state of the size of this country. And nobody really knows. But the fact is, if we start ramping this up, uh, we could, you know, soy, corn, wheat, it's not that, not as healthy as like, as like seaweed bread.

Speaker 4:          01:45:25       Isn't it amazing when you see issues that pop up technological issues, whether it's, uh, you know, uh, pollution or what have you. And then the, these innovations come along to try to deal with the solutions or to try to create a solution for these issues. And it seems like that's one of the things that people do, like they seem, it seems that people need to be in the face of some sort of a problem to solve in order to truly innovate. And when you think of this Otec thing and that this Otec thing happened during the Carter administration, when the gas problems were at the peak for that time, changed the motor industry, the automotive industry was forced to make much more fuel efficient cars, compact cars all came out of that, you know, before the American cars, these big V 10 pigs. And then all of a sudden we had an issue. And then innovation springs from that issue. And you look at all the things that's going on today. Like there's a young man who invented some sort of, uh, uh, at least a theoretical design to clean up the plastic patch in the middle of the Pacific garbage patch. Boyan Slat, I think is his name. I don't know his name, but a amazing idea that in a short amount of time would be able to filter out all that plastic and then perhaps that plastic could be reused.

Speaker 3:          01:46:44       Perfect. Perfect idea. So yeah, the seasteading institute gets proposals about to clean up the great garbage patch, right? And as a generalist who tries to put this all together, uh, someone described a, an expert as someone who can describe to you in great detail why something can't be done. So I get humbled often by experts that describe, well, that's never going to work. It's too hard to build a permanent structure on the high seas. And here's all the reasons why I look at all this esoteric language I use. That intimidates you went to thinking I'm right. And then a year and a half later, I find out shell prelude is building the fucking thing on the ocean. So it turns out to Ken work. Um, so buoyance a slat is an example of this. So he designed this system to basically clean up the garbage patch, the great [inaudible] pitch. This is the system.

Speaker 3:          01:47:32       And he had a huge Ted talk that went viral and went all over the world. And what's so remarkable about him as the only 19 years old, after a few months, huge backlash, uh, people who knew better started criticizing him and saying he doesn't know what he's talking about and people fall for these stupid ideas. And I'm like, well, that's kind of embarrassing. I'm glad I didn't like feature him too much. I guess he is just a kid who doesn't know what he's talking about. So he rose to the challenge. He got some funding, he's out there on the water experimenting and now the backlash has backlash. Now people are saying, oh, it is going to work. Uh, we could ramp this up and clean the great garbage patch. And guess what? Nobody knows. We don't know. All we know is he's proposed this thing. It's attracting a lot of brains to the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:48:15       People are inspired to get it done. There's a backlash. The backlash people were shown to be demonstrated with an experiment on the water that they were mistaken. So he went out and did a small scale of this and he was able to clean up some stuff. So if we scale this up a little work look, cause another problem that won't work is it, it, it, it could even be a terrible idea. But by galvanizing and being a lightening rod for this problem, it attracts new innovative minds to update his solution and find the real solution. This is how the x prize works.

Speaker 4:          01:48:50       One of the biggest issues with human civilization in regards to the ocean. It's overfishing. It's a huge, huge issue. What ideas have been proposed that makes sense, that you, you're aware of that deal with that?

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       Well, I spoke about, uh, Neil sims in the velella research project a moment ago and I'm, and I'm not doing justice to, to, to what he's doing. So mobile fish cages, uh, and it blurs the line between fish farming and wild fish. So fish farming gets a bad rap because, you know, fish farms, they're bolted to the coasts. The fish swim in their own poop that can't go anywhere. They're not living normal lives. Then you have to have, you know, Bile Fallon's and all this stuff. So he's just required us to completely rethink what fish farming is. And he takes it out in the deep ocean where it's below the water. You can't even see it. The, the cages float around in Eddie's behind giant islands. The fish float around

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       in there. Um, and there's, the fish is healthy. It has no mercury. It's higher Omega three content than the wild version of that fish. It's a totally new kind of fish, a Kona [inaudible]. Why is it higher in Omega three than the wild form fish? Because apparently the fish live better, uh, on the deep sea when they're like, uh, fed, uh, by humans periodically, like the wild, the wild. I have no idea. What are they feeding them? They're feeding them a mix of a fish meal and soy. Uh, and then finishing it off with fishmeal at the end. And, um, uh, Sashimi guys, a guy named Wong in, um, in Hawaii or declaring it, you know, a great sashimi. They've had taste tests with his fish where the experts can't tell the difference between farm fish and wild fish. So if this becomes profitable, you're talking about creating huge numbers of fish, uh, on the oceans.

Speaker 5:          01:50:46       And the problem is, is that we treat the oceans like a giant Commons and we're like hunter gatherers out there exterminating them. Um, we're not farming fish, you know, a hundred gatherers homosapiens left Africa and just exterminated all the megafauna on every continent. You know, hunting fish is not the way to go. We proved that with bisons mastodons, even ducks. The way to, uh, increase the biomass of the oceans is the way we've increased the biomass of the land, which is to farm animals. And Neil Sims is trying to do this in a humane way. Well, what was done with bisons is lack of regulation. What's been done with other animals, game animals in this country is left more dear in this country right now than were there when Columbus landed. There's, there's a way to manage wildlife. There's a way to manage certain amount of animals.

Speaker 5:          01:51:35       The problem is if everyone was hunting, there would be no more wild animals. The reality of wild animals is there's not enough wild animals in relationship to the amount of people that are here is 350 million Americans. They would require a lot of wild animals if that's all we ate. There's a way though to regulate. And what the problem I think is least as it's been understood as it's been explained to me, is that with fish you're dealing with international waters. So you're dealing with a bunch of different nations. I mean, they have an issue with the Japanese crews that won't stop wailing. They wail under the false pretense of doing research, scientific research, and then sell the whale carcasses. Having these, there's these boats that the, um, um, the sea shepherds have a attacked and have shown like time and time again. Like these guys are fucking wailing. They're not doing any experiments. They're not doing scientific research. But that's the loophole. The loophole is that these Japanese boats can still kill whales as long as it's for quote unquote scientific research. So they're just killing whales. Right. You know, so the, the ocean, that should not be a wild

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       west. It should be civilization. It should be a part of, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:49       Right. But if there's 7 billion people that want fish,

Speaker 3:          01:52:53       we have no choice but to farm fish. Right. It's like more than a billion people get their main sustenance from fish and that is going to go up. I mean, uh, Lockheed Martin is actually, um, funding, uh, Neil Sims is, uh, experiments, uh, as is like the copper industry and all these different players are coming in because they see the future of food is in aquaculture. I mean, a lot of this is, we get, we have no choice. It's like we, you know, over the last, what 50 years or century have exterminated like 90% of the fish, the sessions, it's like we either we turn that around and we're going to have hunger.

Speaker 1:          01:53:28       Is there a way that they can somehow another repopulate the wild populations of these fish, like tuna have drastically reduced. Did you see Jiro Dreams of Sushi? No. Documentary. Fascinating documentary. Um, one of the sad aspects of it as he talked about what it used to be like, it's, it's about a guy who's been doing sushi forever and it's all about his obsession with creating the perfect dishes and it really interested, well, maybe I did

Speaker 3:          01:53:54       see that. Is, is it set in? Um, it's, it's just about this one Sushi chef. I watched that with my wife. We had mesmerized.

Speaker 1:          01:54:00       Yeah. Fascinating, right? Yeah. The old man in Tokyo, um, in, uh, in the subway station. He's a very small place. Um, I thought it was so my wife wanted me to watch, I'm like, I'm not Washington fucking guide, make Sushi. He gives a shit. And then more and more people told me, it's not about that. You gotta see, you gotta check it out. And I watched it. Uh, but the saddest thing was like showing photos of the fish markets from the 1950s and sixties, and there was just fish everywhere. And he was just talking about the wide variety and the large numbers. Enormous tuna were everywhere. It was just insane. And now it's one 10th of that.

Speaker 3:          01:54:36       Yeah. And, and, and, um, Neil sims refers to himself as a, as a passionate environmentalist and he went back and read about fish populations in the world and you know, he's a great fish kind of sword fish lover. And when he talks about fish, he salivates he's so excited about how they behave and what they do and, and uh, yeah, you like, you can hear the pain in his voice when he talks about what the fish populations were like in 1920 and we can't I long ago. Yeah. And we can't keep treating the oceans like a toilet and like a thing where we can just hunt as much fish as we want. The fisheries have to be managed. Uh, fish farms can help with that and we have to repopulate the oceans with fish.

Speaker 1:          01:55:15       Yeah. Not just farm fish, but wild fish. Like, that was what the question was, was he, do you know of any methods that are being contemplated for repopulation repopulating the wild fish?

Speaker 3:          01:55:28       The only way it would work is if it's profitable to have lots of wild fish. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       so true. And then you would also have to stop certain people from different nations. You'd have to have some sort of an agreement with a fisherman everywhere.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       Yes. And, and people don't, don't realize the, the oceans already, you know, uh, there's like the United Nations law of the seas, there's all these, um, legal frameworks that already operate on the ocean and allow people to interact with each other and there's, you know, overlap in the jurisdictions and it mostly gets worked out and it's, Eh, the oceans is, you know, sort of civilized and it's ready for the next layer of legal evolution. Uh, which I think is a stewards of the ocean, I think. I think we're ready for a kind of a new evolution in market based evolution on the water. I'm a marketplace regulation on the water and, and sovereign nations market based.

Speaker 4:          01:56:27       But the problem is that's how people feed their families, make their profit, run their business. They run their business by pulling fish out of the water. You would have to tell them you're going to make less money.

Speaker 3:          01:56:36       Yeah. Pulling less fish. Right. And that's hard to do. Yes. And sims tells a story about trying to work with, you know, poor fishermen in the Cook Islands and how there's just an incentive for everyone to just take as much fish as they can out of the comments. Um, and, and so it's like if I don't grab the fish, the other, the guys I'm competing with, good. Grab the fish and you can say yes, but we'll need more fish for next year if you killed them all. Now we won't have any fish next season. You know, so we have to have rules. But then the complex reasons why people behave, you know, follow the rules and why they don't. And the problem with it just being a Commons where everyone's competing to get fish out, everyone has an incentive to cheat. So what, what is the means by which you get people to cooperate? To preserve the fish. Longterm resources have to be managed or they go away. Uh, the, the, the present way we're dealing with the oceans is obviously not working

Speaker 4:          01:57:34       right. And we would have to make some sort of an agreement worldwide. And that seems to me to be one of the most difficult aspects of trying to fix the whole po whole problem.

Speaker 3:          01:57:44       I think so, but it's, it's gotta be worked out. Otherwise we'll run it a fish.

Speaker 4:          01:57:48       Yeah. And I hope they don't run out of fish first and then say, what do we do? You know, how do we fix this? Right. I mean, even in areas where they have brought back certain animals, um, to the animals that were on the verge of extinction, you still have to worry about poaching. And I was still an issue all throughout Africa with a lot of endangered species. Obviously we know about this with the rhino that even to this day, even though all the knowledge that everyone knows that rhinos are dying off, there's still poaching.

Speaker 3:          01:58:21       Yeah. And I was reading a recent explanation lately about elephants in Africa and they were contrasting Kenya with a nation that's next to it. And I forget what it is. And you know, in, in one country, the populations of elephants went up and in another country the population of elephants went down. And it was kind of counterintuitive. Um, and you know, the, the place where the population of elephants went down was where there was just like a government monopoly controlling, which was the easily corrupted the place where the populations went up. And it would, it would, it was sort of pseudo public but also privately owned. So they'd sell a certain amount of poaching where it becomes somebody cash cow to have elephants there. Cause you can't just protect elephants and allow the, uh, populations to grow as much as you want. Right. So, I mean, we can drill down and discuss how regulations can evolve to increase populations of wild animals in a manageable way. Um, but you and I don't need to settle it now. The fact is we need more solutions.

Speaker 4:          01:59:23       Well, Africa is a very interesting analogy. It's very interesting to compare what they've done with wild animals in Africa to what, what needs to be done in the ocean. Because there were many animals in Africa that were on the verge of extinction and now are quite, quite common. But they're quite common in these high fence operations where they hunt them. It's really weird, like the populations of boomed on a lot of animals that were almost in danger just a few decades ago. And now there's many of them, like the highest numbers they've ever recorded in Africa and some of these species, but they're in these high fence operations and that's a weird sort of a contradictory situation when they've become manageable, profitable, they've, they've become a resource. Yeah. It'd become a resource that you can manage. And once that happens, that's when their populations go up. But then everyone's like, but no, they're hunting them. Yes, but there's more of them, but they're killing them. Yes, but there's more of them to kill. Right, okay. It's not as a, it's a weird line.

Speaker 3:          02:00:28       And again, it's, it's the superstition that I, as a cease dinner, I'm always trying to get around. The way you solve a problem is to create a monopoly of Nice people who will make everyone else be good. Uh, and we're, we're talking about the same thing. So some of the elephant populations that are controlled by say a government monopoly and nothing else, those populations keep going down because there's no one really incentivized to protect against poaching. And you can, if you, if your work for that monopoly, you essentially have ownership over this. So there's all sorts of reasons to take payoffs and bribes. It's also problem where the elephants, um, uh, interact with people and, and elephants are dangerous and elephants knocked down trees. Um, you know, elephants will, will attack people. And then in these other places in Africa where I guess you described them as high fence operations, you make it so that a, a stable elephant population is profitable to the people who live there. Right? So they say, all right, we'll have like 5%. We'll let people poach for a high number. Well, they're not poaching. It's there. That's actually illegal legal hunting.

Speaker 4:          02:01:31       I shouldn't say names. They pay like $50,000 and they go kill an elephant. It's kind of fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:01:36       Yeah. But then the people in charge of that are like, okay, now,

Speaker 5:          02:01:41       I mean there's either elephants or hunted or elephants become overpopulated. Yeah. Um, so there has to be a way that these populations are managed. It's not just a simple manner of illegalizing the all the killing of elephants. And this is the hard thing for people to get their minds around. The hard thing for people to get their minds around who love animals. Yes. If you really truly want these animals to have large populations, you have to manage those populations. And that's not something that anybody wants to hear. Yeah. And I love animals and my wife is an animal fanatic. And, and if we care about animals continuing to exist, we have to confront the fact that you don't just protect them and allow their populations to exponentially grow until they starve or come in contact with villages and kill people. Well, that's a problem.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       What we have in California with this, this, the government has outlawed in California killing of a lot of predators that are in large populations now. Like most particularly mount mines, there's a large population of mountain lions in California now and subsequently the deer population has dwindled. They have dropped substantially. And there's a place that I go to called to hone ranch on one waterhole. They have a trail camera that's photograph 16 different mountain lines. I mean, that's fucking crazy. That's 16 different animals that are killing something virtually every day. So every day, 16 different mean killing machines and mount line is a machine and they kill pigs, deer, elk, whatever they can get ahold of. And they're just decimating the deer population decimating, you know, any, any, any game animal they can get ahold of and it's illegal to hunt them. And it's not regulated. It's not, it's not being managed, it's not being managed correctly. And one of the reason is because public opinion, public opinion based on ignorance, they think, oh, these asshole hunters want to kill mountain lions. Well, no, but you have to manage the populations of all of these animals. If we're going to be stewards of the land you need, they all need to be kept in check and they all need to be monitored. And it's not being done with these specific predators just because of what I believe is an ignorant public opinion.

Speaker 5:          02:03:55       And I, and I agree with you and what people are working so hard to do with elephants and mountain lions, it needs to be done with fish on a massive scale and massive scale. Bringing it back to what I care, it should be a huge part of

Speaker 1:          02:04:07       what the government and the, you know, like it should be a huge part of what we planned for. And as far as like looking towards the future, I mean, look at how, what percentage of our diet is based on seafood. It's gotta be enormous.

Speaker 5:          02:04:20       It's a huge percentage. And we don't even realize that when we eat some broccoli or we eat, you know, a cow that, that the, uh, many of the crops that, you know, the cow ate or that came from the bralette came from a allergy fertilizers, you know, fuel feed and, um, food, uh, are, are very largely supported by ocean crops. Do you live by the ocean? I, yes, I do. You notion freak. You're like one of those dudes out there. I'm an ocean freak. Yes. This, was this a part of your life always or is this something that's sort of developed? Um, I love the outdoors. I was an eagle scout. Uh, I love Forrest as well. I do love being on the ocean. I think I'd like to live on the ocean. I think the first, you know, if we get a good stead going, I'd consider living there.

Speaker 5:          02:05:09       Um, but yeah, I'm having a backyard. Sure. Ocean, I was just on a boat, um, for, you know, 10 days or something a few weeks ago in the Galapagos Islands and man sitting on a boat and looking at it to see, you want to talk about contemplation, relaxation, you know, some nice breathing. It doesn't take any discipline. It just happens. You know, the human mind I feel like is meant to stare at fire and water and sky and then it gets you to in mountains and it gets you in a good place. Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's like these, it's essentially artwork that's designed by the universe. You know, the thing that people love about artwork is you get to look at something like that, boot, that boot over there. You look at it and go, wow, that's amazing. That's really cool. If somebody built that and that's so cool.

Speaker 5:          02:05:55       Look at some, it may not. Well, what a mountain is essentially the most incredible artwork ever, but it's completely natural. It's there all the time and no one can own it. And you can move, move around it, look at it from different angles, but it's essentially just like artwork and gives you the same feeling that you get when you look at a beautiful painting, but magnified tenfold. A thousand fold. I think so. I mean, we were staying in a place in Colorado, my wife and I, and I spent hours staring at a big man, like it was a TV. So that's deep in me. It was just, I, I couldn't believe the comfort I got from sitting on the porch and just looking at this magnificent thing in Colorado. Yeah. Um, so I don't know, that's just a primal thing. And I think the oceans men, it affected me every time I'm on the water and I'm just looking at the sky, looking at the water, I feel like, wow, I'm turning into a better person just by sitting here.

Speaker 5:          02:06:44       Yeah. I have a friend who has a beach house and we sometimes go to hang out with their place. And, uh, when we, uh, when we go there, it's just amazing how everything just Sorta, ah, just sit there like looking at the water, splashing up against the rocks and everybody's just chilled out. It's almost like it has some sort of a tranquilizing effect on, on everyone around it. He beach communities are notoriously relaxed. When was the last time you were in a really hectic beach community? They essentially don't exist and, and you know, there's always island paradises with like people tell you it's just super mellow people. Yeah. Hawaii. I mean, Hawaii, look, there's a lot of fights in Hawaii, you know, but you're also dealing with Polynesian people, some of the greatest warriors throughout civilization. So gangster that they got on these little fucking canoes, travel thousands of miles across the ocean.

Speaker 5:          02:07:37       I mean, they're just very aggressive people. Yeah. But still pretty cool. I'm pretty chilled out for the most part. Yeah. I'm thinking about like little as like the Seychelles islands and you know, the people that live there. I've never been to these places, but I'm told by people who go there that it's just like everyone is chill and calm and it might be because they're just looking at water all the time. Yeah. And looking at the vastness of the ocean, which sort of falls in the face of any ideas that you have, any delusions of grandeur or any, you know, when you start looking at your life, what's important, what I need to do, I need to get this done and this deal needs to be made. And then you look out the ocean, like actually in the greater spectrum, you know, if you look at it in perspective, like, come on, you're just a little blip, little tiny little thing out there and just maybe just enjoy it a little bit more. Yeah. We, we, we evolved from, uh, the ocean and the, we'd have to complete the cycle and get back to, uh, get back to the ocean and become a homo aquatic us or something. Homo is on another one. You're going to coin another. I just, I just coined that just now.

Speaker 5:          02:08:40       Have you ever, uh, read the, um, the theory about the aquatic ape? Yes. I wrote a chapter about it in a book, the aquatic ape hypothesis. What do you think about that? Well, explain it to people who don't know what it means. Well, it's this uncanny fact that human beings, what makes us different from other large apes and, uh, other primates is that we share all these qualities with marine mammals that only occur among marine mammals. And it includes a subcutaneous fat, you know, a chimp stores. All this fat between is Oregon's. We have it just beneath our skin, just like a manatee or something. We have voluntary breath control. We can, we can jump in the water and swim around. Uh, we have a diving reflex, which otters have, you know, if you dive automatic shuts off your nose and all this sort of stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:09:25       Chimp falls in the water drowns in mere minutes, you know, uh, we're, we're comfortable in water. We're hairless. Most mammals that are hairless are our aquatic mammals. Uh, and you start listing the more you list all these qualities, people are like, oh my God. We went through a stage where we were like aquatic apes. That's what made humans different. Um, and it's one of the, I think the aquatic ape hypothesis is an excellent example of the difference between a hypothesis and a theory. Because what it has going for it is tremendous explanatory power. It, we don't have hard evidence like a webbed hominid foot, by the way. Um, 7% I think of human beings are born with web toes. That's one of the things people don't know why, but yeah, 7%. Yeah. See if that's still true. It was true when I wrote my look it up.

Speaker 5:          02:10:21       Wow. So what I was researching this, you know, whatever, six or eight years ago, yeah, that was true. And I, and I cited the reference web toes. So then you think about, all right, you take a uh, orangutan baby, throw it into the water. It drowns very fast. You take a human baby, throw it into the water, it knows how to hold its breath. It waits till it comes to the surface and then it naturally floats and kicks its feet. So there's all this weird like where did we get all these qualities? It's actually one in 2000 to 2,500 live births. Well that's close enough.

Speaker 5:          02:11:01       Yeah. Well, you know, it's pretty small. It's a one in 2001 and seven. We're 7%. What do you stickler for? Yeah, I'm a stickler for facts. I'm crazy. But it still is a, it's interesting that it, I mean even that one in 2000, it's fairly common. I wonder if it's one in 2000. That's more like a weird monopoly anomaly. If it's something that's way more common, like 1%, that could be something, you know, atavistic like the appendix something left and right. Right, right. One of the other, um, things about the Aquatic Cape theory that are compelling, uh, some I should be an oh, even large brains. Um, the mammals with the largest brains are mostly in relation to the rest of their body are mostly aquatic animals. Apparently dolphins, whales, horcose also that we're, um, we're evolved to process and use, you know, fish fats really efficiently and you're really, really well.

Speaker 5:          02:12:02       I'm like, why is that true? All I know is the aquatic eight proponents keep lining up all these things. And in some cases, the only animals that have these things in common are, you know, aquatic mammals and humans. So it, it, it has to do with, um, the main ones are like hairlessness and subcutaneous fat. What are the, uh, country, what are the arguments against this? The arguments against it are we have not found a single fossil that would, that would support this, this hypothesis. So that's why it remains officially a hypothesis. Not An actual theory of the fossils are really hard though. That's the difference between, you know, one of the things about fossils is that something has to happen in order to create a fossil. For the most part, most people that die, your body is going to be absorbed by the animals, the biology, by bacteria, by rodents, scavengers, there'll be nothing left. It has to, something has to happen. You have to be trapped in a mudslide. Volcano, whatever it is, it's like covers you. It's something that preserves you. Yeah. I think the chapter aqua ape that I wrote for that book is available online and people can go check it out. I think I'm going to have to, I'm gonna have to, I can add that. Now I've got to research this 7% thing. Am I gonna have to update that? You're going to have to update that.

Speaker 5:          02:13:20       It is a fascinating thing though. The idea that the reason why people are so different and why we like if you take a baby and throw a baby in the water, they immediately know the hold their breath. It's a, it's instinctive. It's, it is weird. And I'm like, why do we have all these weird qualities? Yeah. And then also the fat thing that if you take a champ like a little baby, chimps are hard, hard little muscle. Thanks baby babies are just floaty little suckers. They're floaty. Yeah. They're built with all this fat, this fat. And then, you know, if an orangutan gets really fat, you, you don't go up and squeeze fat on the outside of its body. You know, we store all this fat outside, uh, our Oregon's, you know, in our, in our, beneath our skin, this sort of subcutaneous they call it. And that's a, that's a quality of aquatic mammals. It's, it is weird that we have all these qualities, but there's no, there's just no hard evidence is the thing. So it's, and this massive attraction to the, uh, to the ocean. I mean, you don't see a bunch of baboons sitting out there staring at the ocean and all communities are founded, you know, next to oceans. We, we love the water.

Speaker 4:          02:14:29       Yeah. It's fascinating stuff. The Quad Gate Theory and looking at it folks, it's very interesting. Listen, man, this is a great podcast. I really enjoyed this very much as well. It's a fascinating subject. Um, I think, uh, I think, I think there's massive potential for all of this and I think that, uh, it's really cool that you were investing so much time and so much energy and to promoting these ideas and a, I hope anybody listening to this a explores further, you know, go to seasteading.org and check out the website and see what they have to offer. And a seasteading. Is it just seasteading on um, on Twitter? What is the, uh, the Twitter handle? I think it's the CC sending institute. Yes. That is a seasteading institute on Twitter. Thanks man. I had a great time. There's a lot of fun. Yeah, I appreciate it. Is there anything else you want to direct people to or tell people about?

Speaker 5:          02:15:19       Go to the seasteading institute, uh, checkout our, our, our floating city survey. Um, let us know what you'd like to see on a floating city. We have a donation page, they're read up on stuff. We are working on the floating city project and we'd like you to check it out and see if you think it's realistic and if you'd like to move there.
