Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Silver worked real good experience by request of Dr. Rhonda. Patrick. You want it to have that music. So there you go. Now that's how we do it for you. I appreciate you out. How about that? Because of you will do it from here on out. Like you know, there's something about it that makes you feel good. It gets a little opening or something. Little something. Something. Has there ever been a study on what exactly music does to the mind? Like an inspirational song when you're on a treadmill that makes you keep going? Oh man, it makes all the difference for me. All the difference. I don't know. I don't know if they've done that exact study, but I'm sure there's been studies that have been done looking at how music affects the brain. Yeah. I just don't know. Yeah, there's something going on. It's 100 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       Right. I mean when, when a song is, it has to be. It has to work with, you know what if it's a song that was your song, like flash dance, but that's good. I really liked him and out to the stones. I really liked the. Rolling Stones. Yeah. And I also like it when it's like, you know, maybe some ACDC like okay, I need some motivation to like push past that. Yeah, that's what I listened to in the, in the a cryogenic chamber. I listened to back in black because it just seems like a good song for that dude. This morning I, after I did a workout I get a cold shower and I was like singing in the cold shower because it's so cold. It was like me singing and I was like, yeah, no, we're hoping to fit in my brand.

Speaker 1:          00:01:40       And like Dan was like trying to record video but like audio, he was like trying to record it for snapchat but he failed miserably and um, but I stayed in for five minutes and the singing was like, yeah, it helped me push past that. This is cold as fuck. So you did it just for the norepinephrine just for the. Did I say that right? Yes, you did. Thank you. I did, I did it. I did that. Plus I try, I tried doing high intensity workout so I was trying to sprint faster than I usually do, so I like to do a lot of aerobic. I do aerobics and I like to mix it up with some resistance training for different reasons. In the same day. I usually do mix it up, but not always. It depends. It depends. I like to like, you know, sometimes I'll start off with Iran and I don't, I don't do like long long runs.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       It's like two miles, you know enough to like get some brain drive neurotrophic factor growing, which is a growth factor that helps you grow new neurons. That's been shown to happen with more of aerobic type of exercise, but then the high intensity interval training like sprinting or I'll do bodies, body weight squats or push ups or you know, these backward types of pushups. Then whatever it's going to like, get me doing that high intensity sort of thing where you're, you're actually producing lactate because your body is using glucose since you can't get oxygen to your muscles quick enough for how quick you're like, you know, applying for us and putting this energetic, energetic demand, use glucose and you don't use it inside the Mitochondria. I mean you don't, you don't need oxygen, so you do it without oxygen and you make lactate is a byproduct.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       Will lactate's been shown to increase dramatically a lactate uptake into the, into the brain. It increases dramatically upon I'm that type of exercise and it's lactate that's fueling norepinephrine released. So like you're making more lactate to make more norepinephrine and your brain. So, and norepinephrine is, it has an immediate effect of making the connections between your neurons stronger so that you remember things better. Um, and so that you learn better and you remember better. It's called longterm potentiation. So I was like, I need my brain to work today. I'm going to do that stuff. Yeah. Whereas the Abramovic type of exercise has more of a longterm effect because you're making more neurons, uh, but those, those neurons take two weeks to mature. So like the aerobic training that I did, those effects will come two weeks from now when I'm, I have more neurons, but you know, so the immediate effect of the lactate and making an effort and it's happening right now because right now the connections between my neurons are stronger.

Speaker 1:          00:04:18       So and plus it also makes you feel good. Um, it, that's crazy though. There's a physical effect like that. There's a physical effect of your brain actually functioning better. Like there's a direct mechanism involved in your brain functioning better because of exercise. It's so. I have been so obsessed with this lately like this and I know that I have like probably we've talked about this before and I talk to people probably get sick of me talking about it, but this concept of stressing your body stressing exercise. Most people think exercise is good because the exercise itself is good. No, the exercise of this exact exercise itself is not good. It's actually very stressful on your body. And what's good is the stress response, the body. We've got a hard wired genetic program that is conserved in plants, insects, bacteria, primates, humans, you know, we're, we're all, we all have this response to stress.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       And that response is to try to survive. I need, I need to stay alive past on my genes. Obviously the stress response is much stronger. I'm younger when you're younger or the earlier in life because your body knows you're not old enough to reproduce for whatever, you know, hormones and things like that. They're not being produced. But um, so the stress response, which is like exercise causes stress, thermal stress, like heat cold. And then there's all these compounds in plants that are a stressful to us that can induce this. But it's almost like the brain is preparing for the next time it's going to encounter stress. It's like, okay, this is war. I got to gather up the troops, I gotta get this army. We got to assemble this army because that stress is going to happen again. I got to pray for war. So it kind of makes sense that you're, you're going to have a very profound and positive effect in your brain and also in other parts of the body.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       I'm, you know, the exercise itself. Um, it's funny because a lot of people do it to lose weight or to mostly to lose weight or you know, become sexually attractive muscle mass, which has other very important physiological effects, but people do it because they want to look good. Um, and honestly, a lot of, there are a lot of people that say, well, exercise doesn't really play an important role in losing weight. It's nutrition. You know what the right, but exercise has a very important role and that role is to, to cause your body stress so that you activate all these really good and awesome jeans that are helping you deal with stress. And guess what? Stress is happening right now. Every time you breathe in oxygen, your making stress, you're, you're generating byproducts that are very dangerous. So, so exercise is good

Speaker 2:          00:07:04       with definitely good. I just get freaked out when people that are really smart don't get into exercise. And I just, I always feel like that's just, they have a blind spot, you know, there's, there's a blind spot where they don't want to discipline themselves to actually do the work. They just find that troublesome. Or maybe they connected with jocks or people that were assholes when they were in school. You know, there's, there's, sometimes there's that connection

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       option. Yeah. They probably don't realize the, the anti anxiety effects they have. I mean it's, some of the Anti. I really also do it because I've got some kind of like hyperactive stress response, stress, hyper, hypothalamus, pituitary axis where you know, I'm, I'm prone to be like, oh, there's a tiger does lie. I'm like, you know, it's always kind of like, I'm ready. I'm ready to fight. You know, something's coming to get me. Sometimes when I'm really stressed I'll get night terrors. So like I'll wake up screaming. It scared the crap out of Dan. Jesus really not used to be a lot. Like when I was in graduate school and I was really, really stressed. I would wake up and I just scream. I thought there was like someone coming to get me and you know, there was times where I actually injured myself too because I flew across the room because. Because I thought that there was someone coming to get me so, so that more than once. Oh yeah. Yeah. I hurt my wrist hurt like my, like some tendon back here. I broke them near Jesus. Yeah, like once a month. Once a week. Well now a days. It's like almost nonexistent. I would say it happens once every, maybe four months. But there was a time not too long ago, like three years ago where I was doing it at least a couple times a week. Once, once a week for sure. That's so weird. I've

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       always associated people that are like really paranoid about fear, about danger, whether with intelligence, because it's like if you actually pay attention to the world around you, you realize how vulnerable you are and how many random things can happen. Random accidents, bizarre occurrences, run into the wrong people. The wrong place at the wrong time, you know? And we're so easily damaged. Take that as a compliment. But you know, I think there, you know, there's definitely something, it's kind of an ocd loop sometimes tonight and I'll get that where it just and it's so bad like you just get going. I think I haven't even talked about on the podcast before, like there was a time when I was scared to drive like, and even now I, I drive but I feel most comfortable driving in a place that I'm very familiar with. But if I start to let my brain think about it, it's like driving scary.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Yeah. Well it should be. You look around and all these people that are texting to so few people are giving 100 percent of their attention to the road these days. There's so much going on. Self driving cars. I'm actually looking forward to that. But they have them now. Well they're not, they're not ubiquitous or not. They're not. You know, people aren't using them. Well my friend has one and no, he drives with the new Tesla. You press two buttons on it and it literally drives on the highway. It turns. Yup. Yup. He sits back. He doesn't even put his fucking hands on the wheel. He's like, it's the craziest shit you've ever seen in your life. He, Tom, Papa, Tom, papa has to. It was were the new teslas. We're only allowing to let you park. I didn't realize you could actually drive on the highway.

Speaker 2:          00:10:31       The newest versions of them drive on the highway. I have two friends that have them and you pray. I guess there's a button, that navigation button. You Punch in the information and then you press it twice and this sucker will drive you to where you need to go. That's pretty cool. It doesn't work on Shitty old roads though. Like Tom Papa was talking about Laurel Canyon. Laurel Canyon has got kind of like it goes by computer sensors that are detecting the lines based on the cameras that the car has. So the car has these external cameras, they see the lines and then they adjust accordingly. But when the lines are really wonky, like if you. We're going to over Laurel Canyon, I don't think I have. It's really shitty. Le Rose kind of bumpy. A lot of potholes and the lines are really blurry. They're worn out. Yeah. So on that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:17       Yeah, I'm sure you have, but on a really good road it works great. Like it just drives. I'm, I'm, I'm, I mean sign me up. Yeah. I mean I want everyone else to be in because I'm actually afraid of everyone else that's even like coming into La. Like we drive into La. I don't know. People here are crazy drivers. People swerving. I mean just constantly swerving. I don't know if people are just really aggressive because there's so many people and you have to. I don't know. That's exactly noticed it. There was a study, there's an episode of radio lab about this or they did a study on volume of people in cities and what affect the volume of people has on a how many syllables per minute they say and how many steps per minute they take and there's a direct correlation worldwide between higher populations and like you can literally guess if you. If you set up a camera on a street and you record all the people walking by and you get a good number of people when you calculate how fast are walking and then you record them talking just from those two pieces of data. You can tell how many people are in the city like

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       so, but let's see if I can guess so. If there's more people in the city, do you walk faster and talk less? No. You Walk Faster, you talk faster, talk faster, talk faster, and you walk faster. Both of those things. But if there's a direct correlation there, looking at the speed of how you talk, not how frequent you talk. Exactly, exactly how fast you talk, how quickly walk, because I feel like the faster you walk, the more you're like, got to go, go, go, go, go. The less likely you're going to stop and talk to someone. Do you know what I mean? So it's kind of like, it's just like, you know, hey man, I got to go, you know, we're going to do to go get a fucking go downtown and there's a lot of shit going on. See it, buy this. Whereas if you go to the middle of rural Tennessee will.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       Hello, what's your name? Dr. Rhonda will. Very nice to meet you. Dr Rhonda, what kind of Doctor Are you? I guess that could be why there's sort of a, a stereotype that people in the south or a little friendlier. Maybe they just, maybe that's why there's less people. They have more time, more time. I know I get in this loop or it's like I'm so busy. I know you're super busy where it's just like, dude, I don't have time. I gotta go, I got this, I got. I'm trying to get out of that. Yeah, I think it's a good balance. You need a balance, you know there's, you need that drive, that motivation. It's good to like, you're obviously doing something productive that's contributing to society. You, you're fulfilling, you feel like you're fulfilling something. But also then did life just goes. It's like it goes quick, quick. It goes quick and you know, I'm almost 50,

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       48, I'll be 49 in August and then like this is my body works great now, but for how long, you know, nobody's body works great at 70, it just doesn't, they're all shitty. They're all show. Everybody's holding their back and they're fucking knees hurt. When you hit 80, who's an athlete at 80? Who's doing cartwheels at 80 and, and you know, and doing chin ups in a row, it's just not happening.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       I used to surf with a guy back when I was in college. Who was, he was a surgeon, who's Dr we called him doc and uh, he was pushing 90, I don't remember, like 88, 89 or he was, you know, we rounded up and is like, he's 90, but he was out there surfing, catching waves. Now I'm sure it wasn't like competing, um, but I, I do think that the more physically fit you are and the more, you know, throughout your life and the better you eat, these things are all going to affect the way you age. They're all going to affect, you know, how much pain you're in, you know, all that stuff. And obviously losing muscle mass as big thing starting in mid middle, starting at 40 humans start to lose like point five to one percent or something like that. Muscle mass per year, uh, just without, without doing anything.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       That makes sense. Yeah. I think that that's probably one of the more difficult things to gain as you get older. So if you can maintain it, you know, you're way better off because if you just, if you're out of shape your whole life and then also in your pushing 60 and you're like, you know what, I need to get to the gym. Well it's so hard to make gains. It's so hard to do, you know, any sort of like real resistance training on a regular basis and you're going to be so sore, it's going to be so hard to build a base. So it's a much more difficult route. It's difficult now. And you know that resistance training, it's something, I don't know a lot about this but it's a topic that I'm interested in, you know, because I'm convinced that maintaining muscle mass is very important as you age.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       And specifically I think that the type, the type two type of muscle fibers that you're, that you do get when you're doing more resistance training, those are the kind of fast twitch. I think those actually play a role in like stability, being able to like quickly, like lose your balance or which is important as you start to get older and you become more frail and falling down and breaking your hip can. That can take you out. Like that's a big problem. That's another thing that bone density gets increased by muscle resistance training, weight training, squats, dead lifts, things along those lines. That has a pretty profound effect on bone density. There's a, there's a hormone that's actually released, I think from muscle tissue called Iris and that is released when you're doing resistance training and uh, possibly also during a robot, I'm not sure, but it does.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       It plays a role in helping maintain your, your bone density as well as osteocalcin. Osteocalcin released osteocalcin then gets into your bloodstream at pulls calcium out of your bloodstream and brings it back to the bone. So, you know, the thing is, is that most of the calcium that we store in our body is in our bone or teeth and bones and muscle, but I'm calcium plays a very important role in the bloodstream as well. So anytime we're not getting enough calcium, and I think something like 38 percent of the US population doesn't get enough calcium like so there's. There's a huge percentage of the population doesn't get enough calcium and whenever you don't get enough, your body actually pulls it out of the bone and brings it to bloodstream so that it can play an important role in endothelial cells and making sure they don't get to step.

Speaker 1:          00:17:28       And so that's where osteoporosis come saying yeah, because as you age, if you imagine a lifetime of chronic calcium, quote unquote inadequacy, so you're, you're never, you're never getting enough of the calcium every day. Eventually that's going to start to build up and you're gonna keep pulling it out of your bone. You're gonna. Keep pulling it out of bone. You know there's a, there's a couple of things that regulate that. That's one, just obviously just not getting enough calcium so you keep pulling it out of your bone and the other thing is not getting enough of the so doing, doing the types of exercises that you need to do to make sure you're releasing these hormones that are bringing calcium to the bone that are, you know, doing that. Um, and also certain dietary factors can play a role in that. So making sure that you're getting enough vitaminK , two, vitaminK , one is found in green plants.

Speaker 1:          00:18:15       It plays a role in blood coagulation when you have enough of it for that blood coagulation. Then some vitaminK stays around the bloodstream and activates osteocalcin and other genes that are able to pull the calcium to the bone. Vitamin K two never really goes to the liver and that's um, something that's found in fermented sort of a bacteria make it so like you can find vitamin K two in the western diet, like cheeses, bleu cheese is fermented. Cheeses have a higher amount. There's some in organ meats like liver, but Natto fermented soybeans are the highest fermented soybeans, not toe to toe. Yeah, they've got like, if you're comparing like cheese or even organ meat to Natto, looking at k two levels, there's no comparison. Not toes got a huge amount. I've never even heard of that stuff. It's pretty big in the health community.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       Um, it's also high in something else called Spermatozoa, which, um, is able to clear away damaged cells in your body. And it's called drip process called a topic Ge. So we're always getting damaged cells and anytime we have a salt that's damaged, damaged cells occur, um, you know, just just from normal metabolism. But as our telomeres get shorter, um, the team always take the hit. So tila mirrors are those tiny caps on the end of your chromosomes and they always are like sacrificing themselves because they don't want your dna to get the damage because if your dna gets damaged, it could lead to cancer. So they take the hit and as they start to get shorter, it accelerates their shortening because they already get shorter each year. Then what happens is the cell becomes what's called senescent. And what that means is the cell just sits around in your bloodstream or in your kidney or your liver or whatever organ we're talking about, and it's not really alive.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       So it's not mel metabolic, but it doesn't like go away. It's not dead. So what does it just sits there and it starts to secrete I'm pro inflammatory cytokines, which then activate nearby immune cells to like fire away nasty chemicals in damage, more cells. So what happens is you start to damage nearby cells. You can think about like, have you ever noticed like when you get a gray hair, so gray hair, you'll get senescent Malana sites, which are the cells that produce the pigment. You'll get one that senescence. So it's just kind of sitting there and it causes a hair follicle and her hair gray. And then all the other hairstyles around nearby. You always get them near each other. And part of that has to do with the fact that these senescent mental Melana site in this case, which is, you know, in the hair follicle, is to creating all this nasty stuff that then damages other nearby, um, hair soft.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       Wow, that's fascinating. So, oh, so anyways, back to the spermatids, the spermatids actually clears away it, it activates this whole genetic system we have in our body called autophagy, which is like self eating. So we start to like eat this cell and cleared away. And recently, like within the last month a study came out where scientists actually engineered mice, uh, using crispr technology to clear away all the, every time they had a senescent cell. You and I are getting senescent cells right now, but right now, sorry Jamie, it's happening. It's like it's happening all the time. Um, but, but the researchers did this brilliant experiment where they designed, um, they were like, okay, it's an essence cell, has a certain marker on it. And so they then said, okay, when this marker gets expressed, I want you to have the, you have the, these immune cells go and cleared away and eat it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       And so every time there's a senescent cell, the immune system cleared it out and the mice ended up living 30 percent longer than their normal lifespan. Pretty cool topic. It's called. It's pretty cool. And there are other things that actually increase it resveratrol. Brisbane was very trial from, it's, it's a one of those plant compounds that's the spin, a recent obsession of mine. But plants make like natural insecticides and you know, for millions of years, plants have been figuring out a way to like ward off insects and fungus and you know, because they also want to stay alive just like we do and they don't actually make enough of this camp like these chemicals to kill the insect. It's Kinda like just go away. So they often affect their nervous system, um, and just kind of make them go away. But what's really cool is that these compounds in plants and there's so many different ones actually have a hormetic effect on us.

Speaker 1:          00:22:43       So that hormetic effect being in small doses, it activates our whole stress response pathway, like exercise does. And so I'm raspberry trolley is actually made in grape skins. And also blueberries make to a much less degree, but it's made to ward off fungus. And resveratrol has been shown, at least if it's in a high dose, like was milligrams a day to clear away, it activates, it actually activates this whole genetic pathway that gets activated when you're fasting. Fasting is another type of hormetic stress. So when you're fasting, you cause damage cells to clear away. You also basically start to turn on all these genes that help you deal with stress because your body's like, oh my God, I can't, I don't have food. I, you know, I need to deal with this. So you activate all these really good, you know, genetic pathways where you're making more antioxidants are making more antiinflammatories, you're making more brain cells, you're preparing, um, just everything good.

Speaker 1:          00:23:39       Um, so it was a virtual kind of his thought of it, like a mimetic of fasting in a way because it activates like one of these pathways that get activated and it changes gene expression. I've been very skeptical. There was virtual literature for quite some time back in 2003 or so when it was a first first kind of came into the aging world. I was very skeptical of it mostly because a lot of the studies that had been done in animals where they feed animals, Rivera trawl, they feed them such large amounts that are just like not relevant to humans. So I was like, well, so what, you know, but the more I've been reading about it recently, the more I've become a little more convinced that there actually may be something to, to this reserve or trial. It's activating this pathway called [inaudible] one, which is globally changing gene expression, epigenetics.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       It's, it's, it's activating all these good things and deactivating bad things. And so, um, there's really, it's really interesting. There was a study that was published not long ago, a couple of years ago that was done in monkeys were monkeys were given a high sugar diet and a high sugar high fat, which is a bad combo. And it gave him a spiritual, you know, either gave them a spiritual or didn't. And the monkeys, I did not get resveratrol. Their arteries were like really stiffed the, caused their arteries to stiff by like 40 percent. But there was very raspberry trial completely negated that. So I was like, wow, maybe I should start looking into the rivera trial again because it's a little, it's a little interesting. But, um, there's so many other plant. There's a book that was written by an Indian scientists called plant an Antifa dense and it's a very dry.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       I mean, it's a textbook, so it's not like something people like read, like for it. It's a textbook really. But what it, what it does, what he does in this book is there's over 900 different chemical compounds in like a variety of plants. He's a plant in a PR specialist. So he, that's his specialty. And he categorizes like over 900 of these compounds were these, these compounds are, you know, potentially going to induce a hormetic response. And so I know several scientists are actually using some of these compounds that are at least listed in this book to study their effects in mice and eventually in humans. But like some of them, like I'm plumage in plumage ins and black walnuts and it's bench. It actually causes a slight stress in our brain. And um, it has been shown in mice to protect against ischemic stroke because it's like, it activates all these good things.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       It protects against this ischemic stroke. Um, there's another one called galantamine, which is in snowdrop flowers, galantamine is it also stressful in the brain? Like I said, these, these plant compounds are designed to target and sick nervous system. So it's no surprise that are affecting the nervous system of, of mammals. And in fact, in this case, humans swell, galantamine increases acetylcholine production in the brain and acetylcholine plays a role in learning and memory and it's actually given to Alzheimer's patients, galantamine to help them remember things, to help them with their, to improve their memory. But it's, it's, it's just one of those natural insecticides on alcohol. Ian is a nootropic. A lot of people take acetylcholine just from memory. Well, the thing I like about the getting it from, I'm getting it from getting it from a hormetic type of response versus like let's say someone designed a drug to, um, to activate the subtle colon receptor, is that you always have these biological feedback mechanisms when you're.

Speaker 1:          00:27:12       When you start to activate a receptor in the brain, pharmacologically, your brain, your brain knows your brain's like, oh, I'm getting a lot of this stuff that I don't usually get a lot of. I'm going to stop making as much of the receptor. The receptor is what's necessary to have the physiological response. So your brain's like, oh, I'm just going to stop making as much of this receptor. But then what happens is if you don't give it that signal, if you don't take that drug, then you've got less of that receptor and so you're going to have massive, like withdrawal. It's going to be like crazy because now whatever acetylcholine you do make, it's not going to have much in effect because there's less of that receptor there to actually bind to it. Whereas when you have something like galantamine something that's a hormetic inducer, what's happening is you're actually, you're not actually doing anything to acetylcholine neurons or to, to, uh, the, the receptor or anything directly.

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       It's slightly slightly toxic and part of the way your brain deals with the type of stress that it induces is it goes, oh, this is the kind of stress I need to make. I need a seal calling for this for whatever reason, whatever, you know, these plants are doing different things. For whatever reason, the galantamine is like the one that says, okay, Acetylcholine, so your body is, it's a response to something kind of like triggering it, you know? And so you're not going to have that feedback mechanism where it's like. So if you take it into pharmacological, former pharmaceutical forum. Yeah, I'm just saying a lot of, you know, I mean the classic example would be a opioids opioid painkillers. So when you're taking an opioid painkiller, what's happening is there's a couple of different opioid receptors in the brain and the opioid painkillers, kinda like a morphine derivative, which is sort of like endorphin.

Speaker 1:          00:29:00       It binds to something called the new opioid receptor, which is what endorphins bind to. And that's endorphins make you feel good. That's also part of the reason why you exercise while you, you know, you're, you're wanting that endorphin release. Um, well what happens when you start to like make a drug like morphine derivative type of drug that goes and directly activates that receptor, binds to it is that receptor, the new opioid receptor, and you start to make less of it. And that's been shown when you, when you give morphine drugs, you downregulate, you make less of the receptors. So now what happens is when you don't have that opioid drug, you know, let's say you had this much receptor, you started taking the drug, right? And now your receptors going down here, right? And so now if you don't have the drug are down here, and so any endorphin you make isn't gonna do much.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       Like, Oh man, I need more of that. And so you keep having just to get back up to baseline, just to get back up to normal, which is why you can have addiction. Addiction can be very common with those types of painkillers because of the effect on the receptor new opioid receptor. So that's, you know, that's one of the problems. And interestingly enough, there's another type of opioid receptor called the Kappa opioid receptor, which, um, I've, I think I've discussed with you before, and one of the podcasts, because a cap opioid receptors, sort of the opposite of the new opioid receptor because it actually, when you make something in your body called dynorphins it, it's responsible for a dysphoric feeling. Whereas new opioids, euphoric, you feel good. Dysphoric feeling is the Kappa opioid you make dynorphins because it cools your body. So when you're hot, when you're, when you exercise, when you elevate your core, but when you sweat, that's a good sign.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       When you're sweating, you're making dynorphins. When you sit in the sauna, you're making dynorphins and you know when you're working out hard enough that you're sweating, you're physically, you're uncomfortable, right? You're like, damn, this sucks. You feel uncomfortable. And the same goes when you're sitting in a, in a hot sauna and you're sweating and getting really hot. Man, you're just like this. You feel dysphoric, like that's, that's what's happening is dynorphins is binding to the kappa opioid receptor will. The really cool thing about this whole pathway, again come to coming back to feedback. Your biology is so smart. It always figures out a way when you start to add, when you start to activate that cap opioid receptor, your body's like, Whoa, I'm getting a lot of this bad stuff. I need to like make more of these receptors because I've got too much of this dysphoric.

Speaker 1:          00:31:24       So it actually causes more than caused your body to make more new opioid receptors and it makes them sensitive. So then the next time you release Endorphin, you know your workout, boom, it feels even better and it lasts. You know? So that's part of the reason why I know that there are certain drugs that are used to treat opioid addiction, uh, activate the capital you would receptor pathway exercise. Some people use Sauna. I don't think they understand the mechanism, but because anything that's going to help you with dynorphins because people that are taking opioids, opioids, opioid painkillers, there are new opioid receptors are already like down, down, down. You want it back up and dynorphins activating that cap, opioid receptor will do that. It's been shown in multiple studies. You know, so kinda went on a little rant there, but it's.

Speaker 3:          00:32:16       I wanted to ask you, I didn't want to stop you. I'm the first one. Go back to resveratrol and black walnut and all these different things. Do these things work synergistically or do they cancel each other out or is there any problems and combining them?

Speaker 1:          00:32:30       Yeah. Great. That's such like, you know, so the question is synergistically would mean, can you, can you then combine two things and have an even more powerful response? Right. Well the thing is is that because these compounds are targeting different pathways there, you're going to have some overlap which will have a synergistic effect, but you're also going to have a diverse. There's going to be diversity. So you know you're going to have the plumage and, and the black walnuts, galantamine, and then you get your apogen and from celery, you know, apogen and causes your brain to make more neural neurons, neuro stem cells, and you get the reserve tra, which is like clearing away damaged cells. It's also anti-inflammatory. And then you go and eat your Kale and Broccoli. That makes something called isothiocyanates. I isothiocyanates are um, very potent anticancer. So they actually change genes.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       They change. We have genes in our body that are able to convert a pro carcinogen into a carcinogen and I'm isolated isothiocyanates stop that from happening. And we also have genes in our body that can deactivate anything that could potentially become a carcinogen that when we're exposed to all sorts of stuff like everyday. So activating those genes is like super awesome. In fact, it's been shown in mice if you like, if you give mice a really high dose of isothiocyanates and then you would knock, collate them, you inject them with tumor cells, they will not form tumors. Whereas the mice that are injected. Yes. And there's another study that was done in humans and men, men that took around the eight, a 250 grams of Broccoli or Brussel sprouts. So isothiocyanates or in the cruciferous family of vegetables, Kale, Broccoli, cabbage, Brussel sprouts, Bok Choy, cauliflower, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       All that stuff. BRASSICA. Those are all. They all have isothiocyanates in them. I'm actually the isothiocyanates are formed. They're stored in something and the plant called glide, glide costs and rolaids. And in order to release the isothiocyanates that the plants have an enzyme called myrosinase, which we have a little bit of it, a little bit in our saliva, a little bit in our gut bacteria, but not much. Um, and myrosinase is heat sensitive. So when you heat your, your cruciferous, you're inactivating about 50 percent of it. And it's still good to cook vegetables. I mean, it's good to get both, but the raw, the raw kale that you put in your smoothie or the raw broccoli or eating the raw broccoli, Broccoli sprouts have seven times more because they're a young plant. Young again comes back to that when you're younger, the stress response is more potent because nature wants you to survive.

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       So Broccoli sprouts, isothiocyanates or made to ward off, you know, creatures from eating them. So the younger the plant is, the more they make of it. And so. And so, Broccoli sprouts, I used to actually sprout them. Um, have you ever tried Broccoli sprouts before? I have. They're pretty pungent. Let never made them though. It's really easy. Like you can order some cds on Amazon and then get like this, like this mesh bag and you put the seeds in and then you wet the bag and you just keep at every day. And after about five days you'll have broccoli sprouts. So really good on solids. I'm not so good in smoothie. I used to put them in my smoothie and it's like, it makes me want to Barf, like it's so gross. I mean it's really good for you, but it's just like, it's so better.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       But then again, you know, at that when I was doing, I've gone through so many different. I'd make different smoothies all the time. These are disgusting. My smoothies, you'd probably Barf, you have no idea. I have done like Broccoli sprouts, mustard greens, garlic, and then you know, carrots and upset. But that. But that right there, like the. Have you ever tried mustard greens? I have had mustard greens. Have no trust in this smoothie bar. It'll be like, you'll think you're drinking hot chili peppers, put giant chunks of ginger and four cloves of garlic for large cloves of garlic for that is crazy. So garlic. Alright, let's finish the isothiocyanates, but that it all has to do with these hormones in the back of my mind. I still have another question on top of that. Keep going. Go, go dude. I am. This is my recent obsession.

Speaker 1:          00:36:38       Is the plant this plant, insecticides. I really think we don't even know what's in these plants, but it's like, you know these isothiocyanates men that ate 200, 250 grams a bit. They actually in their urine, you can have, there's a biomarker of a compound that inactivates like a certain carcinogen that could be potential carcinogen. And they increase that by 10 percent. Meaning that they are doing good stuff. Basically know the isothiocyanates are really good for the brain to. It makes something called a type of isothiocyanate. His soul for fame, which is in the Broccoli sprouts. It's been shown to like help with autism. I mean because it induces a stress response in the brain and your brain does all this good stuff and then there's like apogen and and the celery. There's a garlic. The Allison Allison is in garlic and alice scene is in order to activate allison, you have to chop or blend or two garlic.

Speaker 1:          00:37:33       So if you just throw alice, scene itself is not sensitive to heat, but if you don't, if you don't chop up the garlic, the enzymes in the garlic allison won't, won't get activated and won't release the allison to swallow a whole clove. Is that what you're meaning? If you swallow a whole club or some people cook with whole clothes, they don't chop them. So if you want to, if you're cooking with garlic, chopped the garlic and let it sit for like five to 10 minutes before putting it in the heat. Really out on a cutting board. Exactly that because that you'll get them, you'll harvest the most. Allison from allison is another one. These plant natural plant insecticides, it accentuates as time goes on. Um, so it just takes a little while for the enzyme to release it. So you, it takes a few minutes. The enzyme release, is it, even though this plant was picked like maybe a week ago or a month ago or whatever has to break the rules of the garlic for the alice and a's to get released, but more of it releases over time.

Speaker 1:          00:38:29       That seems so strange. No, it's not that more of it releases. It's just that you're, you have to give it time to like for the enzymes, get activated and release it. It doesn't take that long. I mean honestly if you were to wait like five minutes, you'd be fine probably, but I'm just on the cautious side, you know, I like to wait like five or 10 minutes. But yes, if you just, if you just chop the garlic and immediately it's the enzymes have to get activated and then they chop it up and then the is released. So that just, that takes a couple of minutes and just seems odd to me that there's a process once it's been picked and it's sitting there, it's obviously not alive anymore, you know, it's sitting in like a little bowl. Yeah. But the enzymes not active until you break the garlic's been picked, but it's in like a club thing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       You have to open it out, you have to get it out of the club and cut the cell wall to activate these enzymes. When I don't feel good, I chew a whole clove of garlic taste to do that. Yeah, it is. It's, it's antimicrobial. They have very, very potent antimicrobial activities. It kills a wide variety of bacteria. When you talked about that mercer case that you had, and I related that to everybody because my friend denny had a really bad case of Murcia and I told him about your, your situation. He had it actually after you had been on the podcast last time. And I um, I told him that his photos insane. He's got a photo that I put on my instagram page of his knee. I mean, his, his knee got within a couple of days. It went from being like mildly infected, like what's going on too.

Speaker 1:          00:39:52       He was in the hospital for weeks. Massive, you know, I intravenous antibiotics. The whole deal. Yeah. Awful. I told him about what you had done with a grape seed extract was. It was. I should probably clarify. I'm not exactly sure it was mrs because it wasn't actually cultured, I assume it was because it came back like three times, but. So I probably one way or another. And so I, I took a very, I was taking garlic pills like every hour, grapefruit seed extract, every app I tend to get enough is the garlic extract from a pill. So yeah, the question is, um, there's, there's aged garlic and then there's just regular garlic pills and then there's fresh garlic. Um, it all depends if some, some of the garlic that is aged has allison in it, but it doesn't have other mcap in it. There's other mcap tens that are doing other things.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       Um, what does the more competent mcap 10. It's a, it's a, it's another byproduct of these plant. You know, insecticides and recap attends our first, they, they bind mercury very well, so they will bind mercury and like help you excrete it, so they bind mercury that's in your system and you excrete it and they also, um, they, they, uh, do something in your brain so that they can actually cross over the blood brain barrier, get into your brain and they're potent antioxidant in the cell membrane, which is, it's kind of technical, but it's hard to find antioxidants that are in the cell membrane itself, most of the time they're soluble in itself, so it's actually very good for your brain. Um, but so I was taking the garlic oil, garlic oil would have it, should have both, both of those. And I was also rubbing it on my sore topically says rubbing it on there and taking it orally.

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       Grapes, Grapefruit seed extract. I've taken Ginkgo, Ginkgo Biloba because that was also shown to be, um, to kill a different staphylococcus strains and vitamin C. and I was taking this stuff like every hour, every hour just overloading your sister like garlic was. It was like massive garlic. Um, but the, the, the garlic itself, you know, it's antimicrobial, but also there was a study that was recently published, men that had like Atherosclerosis, they were given two point four grams of garlic a day and it actually slowed the accumulation of plaques in their arteries by like 80 percent because allison is a very potent anti inflammatory and it helps the endothelial cells, helps reduce inflammation that endothelial cells. It's good, it's really good. So Allison, it just goes on and on. I don't even know. There's so many different compounds, but these are just ones we know of, you know, they're just, they're doing really, really positive and potent things.

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       Curcumin is one that I've been obsessed with. We going to talk about that later. I took a lot of curcumin. I take that every day. Um, I have been obsessed with a certain form of it, this formulation of it. So I know we've talked about this before on the podcast, but could human, there's a couple of problems with the bioavailability of it. The first is I like your stomach acid and your intestines, like you just can't get past that very well. So it doesn't actually get absorbed and whatever does get absorbed, it's like immediately cleared because your body's like a toxic no go away. Um, so taking, taking curcumin, which is in Tumeric, right? It's in the tumor at plant, um, that is, you can be taking it but not getting a lot. It's not doing a lot. So. So, um, there's this new formulation, I don't know how new it is, new to my mind knew to Rhonda a where they take the curcumin and it's put in a fight his own, which is sort of like a Lyposomal, um, but it's a little different to liposomes contain a chemical compound like in the middle of it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       So they have like a phospho lipid kind of complex that contains a compound and it's supposed to increase bioavailability because it gets past the intestinal system. And also it can just fuse with your cell membrane and just deliver the contents of the cell so it can bypass transporters and all this other stuff. Fight. His homes are very similar. They also have this would like this possible lipid complex. In this case, they use phosphatidylcholine, but it also disperses the compound throughout and supposedly it like it's supposed to be more bioavailable. I don't know if that's really true, but I have been reading some published studies using this certain formulation of curcumin in the, in a fight his own, which is phosphatidylcholine and the formulation is got, pat did a name, it's called Meriva, but you know, if there is curcumin and in, in a liposome is probably working the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       I just doubt that dispersing the molecules like within the actual lyposomal makes that big of a difference. It's more about getting past. So what this does is it gets you past the absorption issue and it also gets passed it because it fuses with the cells quickly. It gets past some of the other, you know, getting rid of it quickly issue. But I've been taking it like I've been taking at least a gram a day gram a day of it. And uh, what got me really hooked on it was a couple of studies that came out, clinical studies that were done. Well. First, there was one that showed, um, people that were running downhill, like exercise, some sort of running downhill that caused delayed onset muscle soreness to happen. So whatever it was about the running downhill caused sounding deceleration. Is that what it is? Rough. You were to run a pill on your body, on your body than running downhill is.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       I don't know about your brain though. Your brain's like, oh no. It's like, no, I'm done. Yeah. Um, but it's, it was shown to reduce the, um, the delayed onset muscle soreness by like twofold, taking one gram, one gram twice a day. Isn't that kind of subjective though? When you say look, reducing soreness, it's so hard to gauge. It is absolutely. That absolutely is subjective. And same with the other. There's another publication where people were given. There's not, there's a more quantitative quantified publication, but um, this was, that was done in people that had like osteoarthritis arthritis. They were given one gram. Um, I think it was just one grant a day, not two grams. Think it was one gram a day and it, it actually reduced their inflammatory markers by like 68 percent. It reduced their symptoms of course, but also there it increase their mobility.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       So they checked their mobility, increase their mobility, blake fourfold, so they were actually moving more, you know, and so that's the reason maybe because of the influence anti-inflammation properties. Curcumin is very, very potent antiinflammatory way more, you know, it acts very different than a typical antiinflammatories do, but there was a study done in mice were mice were given like a very high dose of not this formulation, just regular curcumin. They're given like 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight, which is like insane. It's like eight, eight grams for 180 pound male, which is a lot. I mean it's a lot of curcumin. What does that look like in your hand? Big Pile probably to bowl. I did see because I was kinda concerned about toxicity. I did see one study that was done on people that had cancer. They were given eight grams of curcumin a day for three weeks and there was no side effects.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       I don't know. It's a lot, it's a lot. Uh, I personally think the phosphatidylcholine complex is a better approach because there's only one proprietary formulation of that. I think there's an Maria Eva and there's another one someone recently shared with me. Lung, Lung Jebediah. So would you recommend the standardized stuff that you get at a regular vitamin store or. No, I actually think the phosphatidylcholine complex is um, is superior because of the bio availability issues and because it is fusing with your cell membrane and getting just the biology. I'll make sense. Plus there's actual studies showing that it works and you know, there was another study, so this mouse study where they gave them eight grams. What the whole point of this study was, was they injured the mice. They like, they did some sort of force so far they put forest. It was so messed up.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       Now you have no idea how many of my killed like my, my, my scientific career, I don't do it anymore. I used to, I'd killed hundreds of mice in the vegans will come. It's for Madison harvest that I would have killed her. You're a speciesist was so awful. Joe, like the awful part about this is like, so I used to go and kill mice to get the organs, so I would get their livers, which is one reason why I have a hard time cooking liver because I'm like, Oh God, I wrote in liver. Oh no, because the consistency is like the same as beef liver. Um, I get their livers and thymus and spleen. But with the sad part was, is that I had gas them so I'd go to them and uh, as I was doing this like everyday it was like, fine and give me some ice.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       I'm going to guess. And you know, I just, I didn't care. I mean I was one of those, I don't know but call it, but the thing that stirs, here's the scary thing. First of all, when I first started doing it, it was really hard and I felt really, really bad. Like tears. Like I was sad. I was, I was like, I can't do this. Like, you know, you're not going to get your phd. I'm like, okay, I'll do it. I'll do it. So it was hard for me at first, I totally got used to it where it was like nothing, like I didn't even think twice. I just take a handful of them, put them in the little box and had gasoline. I mean it was so fucked up. It is. But, and here's the other scary part is that then I would have long periods of time.

Speaker 1:          00:49:39       I'm a very empathetic person that people to like I really am just that have long periods of time when I didn't kill the mice and then I'd have to go back there. So like months would go by and then I have to go back and do it and all of a sudden I was like I can't do this. And I couldn't watch them. They'd start breathing, you know, and trying to gasp for air and I just felt awful and so I'm just glad I don't do that anymore. I moved onto humans, take their blood, take their blood, but the, it's better for them that way. It's better. Yeah. You're helping them. Yeah. So, you know, the, the mouse stuff, man, it was, there was you like when you have to do something and you know, I was medical science doing cancer research. I wasn't just doing it for fun, but it was definitely um, is strange feeling to like feel that desensitized sensitizer I'm like, Whoa, wait, and I've been doing this for like four years. Why am I all and caring about this again? Just take a little break. Yeah. Because I was doing other experiments that didn't require that I had to kill, kill mice and get their liver. But.

Speaker 2:          00:50:39       So would you recommend taking regular curcumin that you get from a regular vitamin store or do you think there's some benefit of it?

Speaker 1:          00:50:47       Yeah, absolutely. But it's just not as much as much because first of all, you're not going to absorb as much of it. And second of all you're going to, you know, clear it away quickly. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       but what is there a better formula of resveratrol? Resveratrol? Supposedly there's some of it in wine which they were trying to correlate with the positive health benefits of drinking glass of wine a day. But as far as I understand, it's a small amount.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Yeah. So if five ounce glass of wine has about two milligrams of Risperdal, which if you're talking about this study I talked about in monkeys, they were given like 480 milligrams. That's, you know, you're not gonna like monkey. You're not gonna yeah. For a monkey and you're not going to like. So you're not going to like have that same effect. And like I said, they're a thousand milligrams was for the clearing of the topic, clearing away damaged cells. But you know, these are, these are a little chemical, these are, these are chemical compounds that are triggering something in our body and whether it's two milligrams or 400 milligrams, it's doing a little bit of something. And so, you know, I wouldn't just throw my nose up. I mean you're not going to like live 30 percent longer because of it, because you drink wine, you know, but it's still, you're still getting some, you know. So there's something to that. There is, there is something, but it's not

Speaker 2:          00:52:02       grocery store. He was drinking a box of one. He drank a box of wine at night, which they think is like eight bottles.

Speaker 1:          00:52:09       How did he not like die of alcohol? Some people have like a weird. They have a variation in their gene where they're able to actually convert the alcohol to acetone and Acetate, which is ketone. So they actually get benefits from. It's really interesting. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. I don't know. I know. Well clearly he's got something if you can drink that much wine and not.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       When he was telling us he was chocking it off like it was no big deal and we're all like, wait, what, what the fuck? Like a whole box. Like even Brian was like a box, a box, a box of wine, like a box of wine. It's for like a large family gathering,

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       you know, alcohol in high, high doses like that. It's not good. You can know it. You're going to start killing neurons here. It's not good. You shouldn't do the binge where you're taking so much of it. But having a five ounce glass of wine with, you know, two milligrams and resveratrol may not be as bad it, it's probably probably

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       some health benefit as well to this. The mood altering shift of the relaxing, of having a glass of wine. I've always felt like that's something that we shouldn't really look past. Like having a drink relaxes you and just whatever negative, negative impact that alcohol has on your liver or the toxicity, isn't it kind of balanced out at least on in low doses by the positive benefit that you get from it being a social lubricant, relaxing you, things along those lines.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       It makes sense to me. I mean there, there are so many different conflicting studies out there with alcohol that's good for you. It's bad, it's good, you know, and, and I think it has a lot to do with genetics and just binge or what else are you eating and just all these other things. But yeah, if, if someone drinks a glass of wine, let's say they're like wound up all the time. It's like we were talking about before the podcast, but they're always like the lions coming to get me, you know, it's like, you know, the lions coming to get me. I gotta run. I gotta fight off this beast. I mean that's the stress response, right? That's the, you're activating your sympathetic nervous system, but you know, which is good if you're actually out in Africa and there's a line, but if you're not having that active all the time is actually it, it, it prevents some of the feedback loops that happen in your brain.

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       So when you have chronic stress like that, then you start to, you start to keep making it. Usually when you're making, when you make stress hormone, your body's like, oh, I made this. That's enough. It shuts it off so that stuff that goes away so you no longer shut it off and it just keeps going. And that can cause you to either be super anxious where you're like lions there all the time or the opposite end of the spectrum where you're like, totally, you just don't care about anything. You know, and, and you can be like depressed. Where it's like nothing excites you, you know, you're just, you're indifferent. So having a glass of wine, if that chills you out and you're not saying, you know, I, I think that seems like, you know, okay, if you're having a glass of wine to chill out and yeah, it seems like she'll announce good, but exercise would probably be a better way to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       Yeah. What about the, is there any benefit to stressing your body through alcohol? Like as you were talking about these pesticides that plants produce, their stress, your body, you have this response from exercise, things along those lines. Is there a risk? When I was young I was really dumb. I thought that smoking cigarettes might have a good effect on your lungs because it's like lifting way through your lungs because your lungs would be like, ah, I got to process this stuff and it would make your lungs stronger. Like, wasn't that. I think that was like what doctors believed, like, yeah. Well at one point in time, I mean I know that it was in that movie, the aviator, the Leonardo Dicaprio moving. That's good. No, no, no. That's not the one I'm thinking about. I'm thinking of the one where he was a can. No, no, no where he played. Um, I'm the asshole that, that ran the FBI, the guy who wore dresses over. Yeah. Your hoover when he played j Edgar Hoover when he was young. Only Rod Caprio, uh, in the scene was with his mom and his mom was telling him, you know, that you're frail and you should listen to the doctrine, smoke cigarettes. Like that was the thing

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       that they used to doctors prescribed cigarettes to people to like increase their vitality. Well, I don't know about. I mean, I don't know what their explanation was, but we'll do contain nicotine. I don't, I know you want to, I don't want to interrupt, but there is one thing that absolutely does happen from smoking cigarettes that does benefit a certain population of people because when you, when you put nicotine in your body, um, it, it totally normalizes something called sensory gating, which is what your brain does. Your sensory gating is your brain filtering out all this other information information that's happening all the time. Like Jamie's sitting over there, he's doing, God knows what, but I don't care. I'm not paying attention because I'm talking to you, you know, there's noises out here, there's smells, there's, so it's like your brain is able to focus in and not like keep all these inputs coming at once.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       Well there are people that have, you know, problems in sensory gating and it's genetically related. It's also, there's certain dietary factors that can play a role where they cannot do that. And so they're getting all this input all the time from everywhere. So if they like walk into a room with like a bunch of people, they flip out. It's like, because it's just so they can hear all the conversation. It's all coming in at once. It's like sensory overload. So a cigarette can negate nicotine negates it for 15 minutes, which is why some people probably are chronically smoking because after 15 minutes, man, they got to get that hit again. Or you know, it's coming. A lot of people that are, um, schizophrenia have a sensory gating issue. And so a lot of schizophrenia is actually, I think, I think I'm, this is me totally just throwing this out there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       I think that's likely why a lot of schizophrenia, expert chainsmokers because they're self medicating. That makes sense. But I don't know, I'm just, that's, that's my point. We're talking about nicotine though. You're not talking about the actual act of smoking. Nicotine. You could take that and other forums and nicotine is prescribe. It wasn't prescribed a certain heart patients. So he doesn't have some sort of a benefit. I don't know the heart function. I don't know. I feel like it does. I feel like there's some sort of a medicinal benefit to nicotine itself. Obviously not in a cigarette for him. See if he could find that health benefits of nicotine. Yeah. But Mike dumb idea was that it was like it would stress out your lungs, it would make your lungs stronger. Definitely stress them out. But is there any benefit like that with alcohol? Like is there any like stressing out your body from drinking?

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       Is there any robustness that would be a side effect of that. So here's the thing with anything that's Hormetic, so anything that is a, the dose is very important. You know, when you have something that is stressful on the body. If you were to be running, if you were to run all the time, all day, every day, you didn't recover, you die. You know, if you're a, if you were to sit in the sauna or a cold or you know, so if you were to take like two kilograms of Bok Choy, you know, you'd have some problems. It's too much. The things that are hormetic, two kilograms of Bok Choy would fuck you up. There's like woman pounds of Bok Choy, two kilograms is kilograms. That's a lot of

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       Bok Choy. Yeah. What does that look like? That a lot? Well, a kilogram is one point two pounds. Is that what it is? I don't know. Jamie. Good goal. I think it's one point. Two pounds. It sounds familiar. So two kilograms, two kilograms says it's about a box box, box box box of what? Above? Like a big box. I started looking at, well that's a, that's not a real measurement. I don't know what a box to box you in this room that doesn't make any sense, but what does a kilogram. A kilogram is one point, two pounds, right? Or two point two pounds. Is it two point two, two point two, two point two pounds per. So four kilograms. Eight point was at a point eight, nine pounds of Bok Choy. What is just google that? What does that look like? Yeah. Google four kilograms kilograms to pounds, four kilograms or pounds people in Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       You fucking idiot. You don't even know the metric system. You don't even know what the rest of them. You know what this is my response. Is that Google for things like that? Yeah. It's hard to get even with my stupid brain. So that will kill you. I'll kill you, but it might give you greater goiter like, like it because, um, what does goiter? It could basically cause hyperthyroid. Whoa. Yeah. Really? Yes. That's crazy. Well, the thing about the isothiocyanates, which are in Bok Choy, is that they're anticancer. They're good when you're, when you're getting, when you're eating your Kale. And I'm talking to kilograms again, it took two. That's a lot. Massive amount, massive. Nobody in their right mind would ever eat that much kale or Broccoli or whatever. Bok Choy a day. But if you did, the thing is, is that isothiocyanates can compete with iodine transport into the thyroid.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       And so if all you're eating all day, everyday is Bok Choy, guess what? Your iodine. It's not going to be getting into your thyroid. And so you could have some thyroid problems, right? So you need, that's just overwhelming the amount. And this is, and this is with anything hormetic I am going to answer your question, but the point that I'm trying to make is that a lot of these compounds that are hormetic fasting exercise, you know, doing cold stress, heat stress, these plant insecticides you need the, the key is the dose. So like you don't want to over it. You don't want to have a huge, huge dose of it, you know. And with the plants it's really hard to get a huge dose. But with exercise, you know, I'm not, I'm not sure that running 50 miles is actually that good. It's pretty, it's pretty stressful.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       It's not good. Yeah. So you know, you get the point. But with alcohol it has been shown that in small doses it can have a slight hormetic effect in small doses. Well it depends. Like, I don't know if these studies have been done in humans yet, but like probably like, you know, like a, like a small glass of wine, there is a slightly hormetic effect now. Now keep in mind there are other things that can regulate that, you know, people are different. We all have different genes and so for example, I cannot recover from a large dose of alcohol like Dan Ken because my, I have a certain gene variation and a gene that does not repair damage from two neurons very well, you know, so there are other things to keep in mind, but yes, that has been shown in small doses, at least in animal models like flies, more arms that small dose of alcohol can actually have a hormetic effect. And that's with any class to actually define a chemical compound as hormetic. The, the, the in science, the definition is like there's this, there's a u shaped curve, so when you have just enough of it, you get a positive effect, but when you go over that threshold you start to have a negative effect and that's, that's with, that's what stress, when we're talking about good stress, we're talking about, we're not talking about exercising all day, every day. We're talking about exercising, you know, getting, you know, pushing past and in getting some of that

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       huge issue with martial artists, with the fighters because they always feel like if they do more they will have more endurance and there'll be able to perform better inside the octagon or inside the ring or whatever they're wrestling mat, whatever the competing on and it becomes a real issue with people because overtraining is a giant factor in preparation because they get to the point where the body can't recover from the work that it's done and their mind and their, their actual, their mental toughness and their discipline has actually ruined them because they've, they've gone too far. They started getting chronic injuries to big issue right now. So there's that tipping point we have to realize like what is the right amount of work for and the right amount of recovery versus people who they feel like, well, if you just push yourself further, your body will respond. If you put. There's. There's a lot of people that have had that attitude that if you can just, it'll be hard. You might feel overtrained the beginning, but your body will compensate. You. Body will eventually upregulate and get ready. Get ready for this increased workload.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       The manning on it. Yeah, prepare for war. Well, I mean there's some truth to that. You know, you do want to push yourself and your body will, you will have a strong stress response, but you have to recover. You can't, you can't, you can't. If you. The dose is very important. So if you push yourself beyond, it's just like you're not going to have a recovery period, like you're not going to be able to. Isn't it

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       important than to build your base over a long period of time then? Because you would build your endurance slowly where you slowly increase the base. You make sure that your recovery is consistent and then just keep doing it, monitoring it over a long period of time. Then once you have a very high base, then really ramp it up and then go through like a

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       training camp. That makes sense. Yeah. Nobody does that though. That makes sense. I mean, that would, that makes logical, that makes sense. And, and, and, and even for some of these, these uh, plant, you know, compounds to like in that Rivera trial setting, the monkeys, the first year those monkeys were actually given us a smaller dose. They're giving 80 milligrams for the first year and the second year they were given $400. Very interesting. Right? They started and, and back to your resveratrol. I don't, I don't like I have to. There's so many compounds. There's so many brands out there that are just utter crap. They have like filler and you know, you think you're getting Akinesia but you're not, you're getting some, some kind of magnesium steroids or something. So I'm, I'm, I'm interested in the, is virtual. I'm interested in a lot of these other plant compounds.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       I like to get, it's one of the reasons why I like to eat a wide variety of plants. You know, celery, Parsley, you know there's, oh, there's stuff in like apple peels and in green tomatoes, so ursolic acid in apple, skin and tomato dean and green tomatoes. They actually inhibited gene in your skeletal muscle called atf four. That gene actually starts. It prevents protein synthesis from happening, so it stops your muscle cells for making proteins. So inhibiting that means more protein synthesis and that's been shown in mice, like if they're giving really high dose, like point two, seven percent are solocasts and point zero, five percent tomatoes and they can grow that, increase our muscle growth by 30 percent over what they would do if they didn't have it. That's insane. Yeah, but they were giving them a huge dose still. That's amazing. It's amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:06:35       Thirty percent is like, that's. Steroids can do that. Yeah. Well there's these, these are now out in the market as, as far, you know, foreign nutraceuticals, I guess you'd call them muscle builders. They're all into it, but the, you know, but you can eat. I like to eat apples. I like to, I like to make, um, actually I don't make it. I buy it already made, but it's to tomatillo sauce. Have you ever tried that? It's really good on eggs and put them on eggs and every time I'm drunk I'm eating it. I'm like, ah, missiles, muscles. How bizarre. Um, is rose virtual something you should take with food? Empty stomach. How should you take that? You know, because I've been so skeptical of the field for so long, I've not supplemented with it. I mean, I did for a little while. Um, I'm looking back into it just because now I'm interested.

Speaker 1:          01:07:22       Now I'm very interested. I, I, there's, there's also someone pointed out to me because I, um, I did a post on this and they said that was vera trawl was shown to negate some of the high intensity interval training gains or something. I didn't read the study. I don't know exactly what that means, but I'm. Brisbane all has been shown to actually cause a mitochondrial biogenesis and shift muscle fibers to type one which are more endurance. The thing is that Raspberry Charles, not like an antioxidant, it's not like taking vitamin E, the difference between taking an antioxidant or to even taking like Ibuprofen, like if you do these studies, studies have been done where they've shown that taking like Ibuprofen or taking supplemental vitamin A, you know, after a workout or while you're working out can blend some of the positive benefits from it. And the reason is because when you exercise you are, you know, you're causing stress.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Like we were talked about, talked about you're causing inflammation, you're causing, you know, reactive oxygen species to form and this is very important for the stress response. That's, that's why you have a positive effect. But if you're taking something like vitamin D, vitamin e actually like it's like a sponge it like goes around and stuff and he's like, oh, here's a reactive oxygen species or an inflammatory that just stops. It sucks it up. And ensades, you know, they, they, they stopped the inflammatory mediators from being produced, revere, trawl, curcumin, you know, these plant insecticides, they don't work that way. They actually are stressful themselves and so they activate these anti inflammatory genes, antioxidant genes, all this good stuff. So it's a very different, you know, then then taking, um, an and an antioxidant or an anti inflammatory and implement those nsaids or they're not really good news in my opinion, they're, they've been shown to increase heart attack, heart attack and has been shown and say it's.

Speaker 1:          01:09:18       And so if there's an FDA warning label on every Ibuprofen bottle and all that, you can buy in the market. So that's bad for you. So, well, it's nonsteroidal, anti inflammatory, right? Yeah, it's Ibuprofen. Yeah. The thing, the thing with some of these, it depends on the type of, of um, and said, but with, with Ibuprofen and other ones. So ibuprofen targets. The way it's an antiinflammatory is it targets one of these enzymes called Cox two and it stops Cox two makes inflammed it makes leukotrienes, and excuse me, trump thromboxanes, which caused platelets to aggregate. They also cause inflammation. It makes this other chemical that's involved in pain. So when you stop that enzyme from doing that, then you're going to have less inflammation. You're going to have an inflammation causes pain, right? So, so you're going to have an anti pain believing that you're going to have a pain relieving effect.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       The problem is, is that when you inhibit, again, we get back to biology and feedback loops and you know, our, our biology, we've, even though this enzyme, Cox two causes inflammation, it's also an anti inflammatory at the same time, Cox to also, it's important for making sure platelets don't aggregate too much. So at the same time it's doing something that's making them migrate. It's also like, okay, let's keep this in check and let's make sure it doesn't go overboard and it also makes something else, um, that's important for relaxing, smooth, smooth the smooth muscle cells in your blood vessels. Um, and also it releases nitric oxide. So when you spoke that enzyme to blocking the inflammation and pain, but then the, um, the smooth muscle cells become stiff and you make less nitrogen oxide. So, which is important to relax the blood vessels. And that can be bad.

Speaker 1:          01:11:06       If you are a stiffening your vessels a lot and you have plaques, the plaques can then, you know, kind of come off and get clogged and you have a friend who takes that shit every morning. He'd runs a lot, he runs a lot and he takes it every morning and he'll take it before he runs. So he probably, oh, that's not. First of all, I'll send you this study where at blended the gains from exercise. Like it really is new. Cameron hanes get off that shit. I mean women. So there was like eight different clinical trials that were done and this is what made the FDA put a warning label on all ibuprofen bottles is because chronic use increased the risk of stroke and heart attack twofold. And the, and the Mecca, there was a study that was published a few months ago, um, that was done in animals that showed the mechanisms.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       So it showed exactly what was wrong with inhibiting Cox to, um, I've been very concerned because I know that like almost every female that I know takes it once a month, they'll take it once a month is a, if you're chronically taking it every month, you're taking it for a week, one week out of every month and you're taking it every month. So really it should be reserved for a pretty significant injury where you are in real pain in my opinion. Look, I don't know, maybe taking it one week out of them it chronic use in this wasn't, this was done in, you know, there's eight different clinical studies. Chronic use. To me, chronic use is taking it every month. So once a month would be. I mean it. So if you get so drunk that you're fucked up and you're hung over and wrecked once a month, that's chronic use. Then people take that for hangover.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       Yeah. I don't know if you're, if you're, if you're getting ripped, if you're, if you're drinking a lot of alcohol going, would you consider that chronic use? So most people wouldn't. Most people think chronic users like every weekend, so once a month is enough that you don't have enough time to recover from the damage, is that what you're saying? I think that once a month if you going overboard like that to me. Um, I, I, I, you know, I don't really have any evidence that once a month. In fact, I know there have been some studies that have to look into that. I would think that going out and binge drinking once a month is probably not the best thing. You know, you can handle it more when you're younger, but especially as you get older are our capacities to handle that type of stress or decreased, you know. So to me, especially as you're getting older, you're probably not, you're probably doing more damage by doing that. What I was getting at, would you be as concerned with someone taking your Ibuprofen once a month as you would be someone binge drinking once a month?

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       I am concerned about Ibuprofen but, but I don't know. I don't. I don't know actually. I've never heard anybody talk about negative effects of Ibuprofen, Ibuprofen. I'm the selective Cox two inhibitors or even worse, which are, I don't know the brand names for them. Cox, Ibuprofen targets Cox two, but it also targets Cox one, so it's not as bad as the selective cox to only inhibitors, but um, that, this was big news. It's like, you know, the fact that the, even the FDA, even finally it was like, wait a minute, something's going on here. We got to at least put a warning label on these ibuprofen volumes. They started doing the,

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       I'm probably like eight months ago, seven or eight months ago. Wow. That's very recent. We consider this would have been taking Ibuprofen. Yes. And I've been very concerned about my mom. I actually got my mom this, this Maria. Here it is FDA drug study after. Wow. This July strengthens warning that non aspirin, nonsteroidal, anti inflammatory can cause heart attacks or strokes. You. So you're so used to saying things like ensades. Most people are like, what the fuck? I haven't started me. No worries. The US Food and Drug Administration is strengthening existing label warnings that non aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs increase the chance of heart attack or stroke. Wow. Based on our comprehensive review of safety information, we're requiring updates to drug labels of all prescription nonsteroidal anti time fly. Now this says prescription prescription, but if you. But ibuprofen is Ibuprofen. So if you take a regular pill that has 200 milligrams you by prescription, it's 800 milligrams. I always take four. So four is 800. Anyway. So if you take for advils, it's the same as a prescription. Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory. If I ever take it, which I rarely do. I always just, I'm a dummy. I always just go for the full dose did I've been. So I got my mom.

Speaker 1:          01:15:32       It seems to be a big problem for women because like I said, they take it for menstrual pain, so they're, they're prone to like rely on that. And like every woman I know relies on it. Like for, it's like you know what a little bit of pain is. Okay. And you actually, like, I haven't had, I haven't taken ibuprofen except with the exception of like if I have, if there's some like surgery or something where I'm like, Ugh, they're required to take it, but I haven't taken it in six years. Like I avoid it and I just, I deal with pain, menstrual pain, but, and other pain, I just like, I just don't, it's not, it's not that big of a deal, you start to get used to it. Um, but I got my mom this, this Meriva, this curcumin and phosphatidylcholine complex. And I told her I was like, take four of these a day, which is two grams because she's got arthritis and all sorts of chronic pain and I have to, it's hard for her.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       I'm trying to like get her on the right diet and all that. But compliance is an issue. But if she starts to notice some changes with something easy and it's like, oh, I do see this kind of working, you know, so that's Kinda my goal. But she said it's been helping with her with her pain. And also, um, she's like, she's more mobile and stuff, so I'm from the catechumen. I'm, I'm actually like, I'm thinking that it's the, it's the. So there was a study that I did, I tell, did I talk about the study that was done that compared it to Ibuprofen. So this clinical study that compared people that took the Maria va curcumin in the foster pedal, colon complex, um, they took two grams a day and it was comparable. The anti pain relief is comparable to 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen or thousand milligrams of Acetaminophen.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       Acetaminophen can be bad for the liver and cause liver toxicity. That's pretty awesome that it was comparable? Yes. And comparable as far as the results through subjective. I'm like, what was the, how they measure it? I don't remember. Is that inflammatory markers or was it like a subjective? I don't think so. I don't think other other ones have measured inflammatory markers with that curcumin and phosphatidylcholine. But I don't think this a particular study did. I think it was subjective, but they didn't know what they were getting. It was control. It was like double blind controlled. So they were there getting something right. So it's just a matter of like them on a one to 10. How much relief did you get? That kind of thing. I don't know. I have to look back at the study. I don't remember it. It's most likely subjective though. It's nice. I have a hard time believing you don't remember anything if so much shit stored up in your brain. Come flying out. What do you have room for? Like friends' names and birthdays and stuff. Was it even in the calendar?

Speaker 1:          01:18:05       Um, the other question that I wanted to make sure that I asked you, because we talked about this through email was I know that you've done a lot of work on the benefits of Sauna and the heat shock proteins from sauna and I was asking you because I recently, not recently, but over the last year really got heavily into hot yoga and I'm like, I wonder if that's what's going on here because I leave those classes and I swear to God a fucking asteroid could hit my car and I'd be like, well I guess I don't have a car anymore. Sot Nom nom I stay like you. You get so chilled out from doing that there. There's some, there's, there's something going on that's akin to some sort of a drug response. I think I talked about this before because when you're hot, when you're working, when you're doing hot yoga, you're releasing dynorphins and the reason you released I norfund is because it cools the body and your body's like when you're, when you're heating the body, your body tries to cool itself.

Speaker 1:          01:19:00       When you're cooling the body, the body tries to heat itself, right? So, so this is what's happening. When you're doing, when you're doing the hot yoga, you're making dynorphins dynorphins. So while you're doing it, it's kind of like physically uncomfortable. You're holding these poses and you're like, ah, you know, when you get out, because of the whole effect on the new opioid receptor, you have more of them. That endorphin that you released or that endorphin you're going to release an hour later when you see your kids or whatever good thing happens, man, it's going to be like awesome. It's going to feel really good. No, it's incredible. It's incredible. That's what I, that's what got me into the sauna and the first place when I was in graduate school because was me waking up once a week and screaming and like flying across the room, punching mirrors and I literally broke.

Speaker 1:          01:19:41       I broke a mirror with my. But while I was injured I was injured for. Wait a minute. Where was the mirror? It was one of those mirrors that you like buy at target and it's like you can stick a full body mirror to see jumped out of the bed and like throw yourself at it. Well we had it like against the wall, but it wasn't hung on the wall so it was like cleaning cars cheap and whatever. Just busy. Whatever it does, it's serving a function. I can see myself. So I like, it was kind of close to the bed so I like flew off the bed and like hit the mirror with my butt and broke it. And I was injured for like, there was like two months I couldn't run. I couldn't do, I couldn't do squats, I couldn't. I was like, if I didn't have the sauna in the mirror, is that what you're saying?

Speaker 1:          01:20:24       But you know, I like muscle tendon. I don't know. I don't know. I have no idea what I did all from sleep. From anxiety, yes. So crazy. But you can see why. Like when I discovered the sauna I was like, wow, this is. Because I would go, I would go to the sauna. I lived across the street from the MCA and so the YMC has a sauna and I would wake up in the morning and I'd go work out or do the sauna both, you know. So I'd go and I sit in the sauna for like 30 to 45 minutes. I mean I was pushing it and I was miserable. It was hot and, and there are times when I would stay in there for 45 minutes. I'm not recommending people do this, I'm just telling you what I have experienced and I'd get out for five minutes and then I go back in, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:21:09       So I was like, I just pushed it and that would go into the lab and it didn't matter who was stressing me out. He was telling me what to do, what or if my experiments were failing and I was like, oh my God, six months of work down the drain, you know, like, I didn't care. I was like, oh, okay, I'll have to start over after we think this. Like, wow, it was. So I was like, that's when I looked and I was like, something's going on, something's going on. I got to figure it out. I want to know. And that's when I like started just going into the brain effects on the sauna. Everyone always focuses on the detoxification and all that. I was like, dude, something's happened in my brain. I don't know what I'm saying, dude. All the time. It's like a nervous thing to do.

Speaker 1:          01:21:47       Not usually do that. I'm not really. Not all the time I'll say dude, but not like, not like you're wired, you fired up. Um. So do you think that a similar effect is happening when you're doing hot yoga? Even though it's not as hot as a, the sauna, it's 90 minutes at 104 degrees and you're doing physical activity, you're straining. Anything that's causing you to sweat is gonna cause you to release the endorphin because you're, you're, you're overheating, right? That's the way your sweat is supposed to help you. Cool. So you're also releasing dynorphins. There hasn't been a study on hot yoga. I get this question a lot. There hasn't been a study on steam rooms. There hasn't been a study will. There hasn't. There's been a couple of studies on hot baths are a Jacuzzi's, but not looking at the brain, looking at other things.

Speaker 1:          01:22:38       I'm personally, if you just think about the mechanisms, I think that it's very likely and if you're gonna, if you're pushing yourself to sweat, if you feel uncomfortable, then you're, you're, you're doing the right thing, you're releasing dynorphins and you're getting the heat shock proteins. You're getting all that good stuff. So it makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So it's in it. It is very addicting. It's also part of the reason why exercise can become addicting. People always, always attributed to the endorphin release. I actually think it has a lot to do. Also with the dynorphins, the pain you experienced, the discomfort you experience is very important, uh, because you're actually then having that response that hormetic you can almost think of it as a hormetic response because the discomfort is what's causing you to make more of the new opioid receptors that you're more sensitive to the endorphin and more sensitive to that. Um, feel good stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:23:29       It's funny because that's one of the main things that people try to avoid in life is discomfort. That is probably, if you, if you looked at especially lazy people, you looked at the primary thing, they try to avoid the turn. Avoid Discomfort.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       Yep. Yep. Like this, this morning I woke up and I was like, I have to go to gym, have to go and have to, like, I got to like push it and I was running. I was doing sprinting on the treadmill. Usually I, I, uh, usually a sprint, like the last end of my run, but I was just spreading and I was like, so I was doing it. I was like, oh, this sucks, this sucks, but I have to do it because I'm, my brain is going to help me. The dynorphins and also the norepinephrine norepinephrine, which is um, you release when you exercise, release a lot of it in the cold. I took a cold shower to cold shower was like a pretty good as well because the cold also norepinephrine released nor nor epinephrin when you're exposed to cold because norepinephrine causes vasodilation. And so when you have vasodilation, you actually are losing less heat.

Speaker 2:          01:24:34       I always take cold showers after hot yoga. It's amazing in the winter because in the winter there was actually cold because of water here is not really that cold because it's California. If it gets cold out it's like 50, but when it's 50 the water's actually cold. So like after a hot yoga you get in there. It's really uncomfortable. It's hard to breathe, you know. But when I lived in Boston, there was a guy named Bob a roller that I used to do taekwondo with this guy in the middle of January. We take cold showers and he'd say that it's good for the spirit and he was like, the only guy that would do it, everybody would just stand there and watch them. Bob's going to go in the shower and he go in the shower by himself and to obviously by himself. We're like, we're going in the shower with him, but this guy would take these cold showers and I just. I couldn't imagine why anybody would put themselves through something like that, but I guess he kind of knew even back then there was some sort of a benefit to standing in that freezing cold water and just not just mentally as far as like your discipline and your self control to be able to stand there and force yourself to do something like that, to have that sort of autonomy over your body like that, but also because there's, there's all these different releases, these powerful endorphin releases that you're getting from that.

Speaker 1:          01:25:43       Yeah, it feels good. It feels really good.

Speaker 2:          01:25:45       Is there any danger in going from say, a hot yoga class to cryotherapy?

Speaker 1:          01:25:53       I would love to know the answer to that, so I've. I've recently experienced, um, I've, I've gone from a really hot sauna, like crazy hot. I mean it was like 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah. I had to wear one of those hats. It was crazy hot, like the hottest I've ever experienced. So I went and I was with an acquaintance of mine, um, and then I went directly into an ice bath and I did four rounds of this, like for, and it, like the experience itself was amazing. Like I felt really, really good, really good, like euphoric entering. Well I was in the cold. Well, once you go in the ice bath and you go back into the sauna, like, and you're in 180 degree Fahrenheit Sauna, it actually feels like room temperature and it's kind of like, whoa, this is something kind of cool about it.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       Like you just, you feel really, really good. Um, I, there were points when I started to get a little light headed and spinny so spinny and it was maybe low blood pressure, low blood glucose. I hadn't, you know, I don't know, something like that. But I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm really wanting to know and I have to look into the literature, you know, I put, I just recently put out a report and a podcast on cryotherapy and the benefits of cold, but I really was hoping to find more on going from hot to cold because mostly one I felt so good. And the other thing it does it reset my circadian rhythm completely. Like I just, I went to bed at like 9:30 and I slept like a baby. It was like, how do you think it did that? I don't know. I think that there's something, I don't know if it was the hot cold or just the cold, um, ics.

Speaker 1:          01:27:41       So I, so I did this around 6:00 so it was like right before bedtime, but I'm cold. Does, you know there is a circuit, there is a regulation of when your body starts to cool itself and it cools itself right before sleep. Melatonin plays a role in that. When you make Melatonin, it actually starts to cool the body a little bit as well. I really don't know, Joe. I was trying to figure it out, people aren't doing studies on it, but it was very real and I experienced it. Is there a difference between doing cold before you go to the bed and doing a song before you go to bed? As far as the results I'm doing, the sauna sometimes can actually like immediately keep you up, but also it's. It affects rem sleep and that's been shown and piglets as well and Dan swears that he would have all sorts of lucid dreams.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       I don't remember. I don't really remember that aspect of it, but it does seem to affect sleep, so lucid dreams from like the heat or something. Probably not. Maybe. Maybe something else going on in the brain. You also do release norepinephrine from, from anything. That's when you, when you're stressing your body, when you're doing your workout, good enough. Like any sort of stress. Also a stimulation like novelty releases, norepinephrine and that, you know, maybe Acetylcholine is being released. I don't know. You know, they're, they're calling. It does have some sort of a positive effect on, on dreaming, right?

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       Yeah. People report really intense lucid dreams from taking a lot of different nootropics, but particularly Coleen,

Speaker 1:          01:29:09       someone was telling me about galantamine because I was talking about it before and someone was like, Oh, this causes lucid dreams. I wouldn't have known that, but there's some. Yeah, there's some, some aspect.

Speaker 2:          01:29:21       Five htp as well. Five htp may be beneficial to lucid dreaming. Something about

Speaker 1:          01:29:27       that's strange because Serotonin in the brain gets you out of it. It takes you out of rem sleep. Serotonin

Speaker 2:          01:29:36       takes you out. So if you were going to take five htp should take it in the morning, then

Speaker 1:          01:29:41       I don't know what the whole half life and all that. I mean it has to like five htp has to then get into your brain and then be converted to Serotonin and

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       I don't know, so it might actually be good to take it at night and then by the morning rolls around, it's done converting it. No. No. Okay. Sorry. Um, the, what would it take to do some sort of a study like the study that has been done on the sauna for something like hot yoga? What would you do that,

Speaker 1:          01:30:10       let's see, it depends on what you want to measure. So I think if you want to look at heat shock proteins, um, you could look at them in blood cells, so you can measure them in blood cells. You could look at, you could measure norepinephrine from. There's actually a biomarker of norepinephrine that is called salivary Alpha amylase and it's released in saliva. And actually it would actually be really, that would be a marker, like if your workout, if you're pushing your workout hard enough, you'll release more of that Alpha amylase, some more, more norepinephrine, so you can measure that. And then hsps. So you just have to have volunteers and then sauna, then you'd have to have a lot of people that are gonna, you know, take the blood, you have to have physicians involved and then you have to have people that are gonna, you know, isolate and look at the protein.

Speaker 1:          01:31:01       Maybe even looking at gene expression would be cheaper. I'm doing something similar but not with sauna. I've been involved in a clinical trial with blueberries. Actually another one of those plant hormetic compounds. There's another one in blueberries called Anthocyanins, which is really, really, blueberries contain a small amount of territory. They contain very late, about 10 percent of a grape skin has. So the blueberries, what, what's really good. And blueberries is called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins are produced as a response, you know, they're, they're a plant insecticide. Uh, they actually like they bind to a certain gene, the Anthocyanin itself recognizes like a little sequence of DNA and turn and bind to the street and like turns it on. And this gene is called NRF two and it's like a master regulator of all these, like really good repairing DNA repair enzymes. I'm antioxidant enzymes, anti-inflammatory, all these good things.

Speaker 1:          01:31:56       Um, and so I've been involved in a clinical trial for the past two, maybe even two and a half years now where, um, my colleagues and I, we've been looking, we've been taking blood from people that are, they're obese. Their BMI is about 28 or above. They're obese. Their insulin 28 is, he is obese. Well, they also measure BMI is 30 is actually obese. We moved it, we moved the BMI down to 28 because it was like we weren't getting enough people. A 30 is technically considered obese. Wow. Yeah. Well, I mean a lot of people were 30, right. You have to consider BMI is not a really good measure of obesity because people that are very muscular and short may also have a high BMI. So you have to also look at waist circumference and other factors which, which they are doing. Um, but, but there are a lot of obese people.

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       There are, there are a lot of obese people and we're looking at a certain percentage of them that are right on the border of becoming type two diabetics. So they're insulin resistant so their body is not responding to insulin but they're not type two diabetic clinically yet. Um, and so we're, we're, we're getting rid recruiting these people and we've gotten 50 of them and half of them are getting a freeze dried blueberry powder that's equivalent to two cups of blueberries and it's got lots of anthocyanins and all this other stuff that's in the blueberries. And the other half is getting a placebo drink, which is blue looking and they put sugar in it, which is. But yeah, you gotta you can't give someone a placebo and not. And not taste like blueberry. Right. Is there any benefit to eating actual blueberries versus the freeze dried powders?

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       Yeah. You're getting the fiber, you know, you're, you're getting probably that's the main thing, that fiber and who knows what other compounds that may be not maybe destroyed somewhat by the freeze. Dry. I don't really, that's what I would be confused about them. I've always been confused about that. And when you see the various freeze dried, you know, anything or any, any sort of dried, powdered anything, I always wonder like how much of that are you actually giving? Like what, what, what's, how much of the actual benefit is lost in this turn? Turning it into a pill. Yeah. So there's definitely some, some things that are lost, but the specific things that I'm interested in, like the anthocyanins are there. Um, but so what I've been looking at it, there's other people that I'm working with are looking at, um, you know, markers of inflammation, glucose response, like all the metabolic parameters.

Speaker 1:          01:34:24       I'm specifically looking at people's damage to their DNA. So like we get white blood cells and the frozen down and then I look at the DNA and the white blood cells and see how much damage there is. I do it at baseline. So before they start the blueberry powders and these people have a lot of damage because they're obese. Obesity accelerates, damage to DNA, damage to DNA causes all sorts of problems. But eventually it leads to cancer. And people that are obese have a twofold increased risk of multiple cancers. Ridiculous article that I read were talking about the positive benefits of being overweight and were

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       where people were trying to justify being overweight and they were. I'm talking about there's a certain illnesses that people recover from better if they're overweight. And they were very few very strange examples they were using. They try to justify being overweight. And um, and it was also the article was also impartially in response to quote unquote fat shaming, you know, and I'm like, boy, this is just such a weird justification. It's so bizarre that your, your very biology, very the thing that gets you through life, that people are so intent on receiving mouth pleasure, which is all it is. I mean, that's what you're doing when you're shoveling food in your mouth, you're getting mouth pleasure and then you're getting the response, the, the physical response to whatever sugars or anything that you, you, you know, your, your body and your gut bacteria craving. But so, so much into that you're broadcasting it in the form of this is like really misleading article that was just designed to make you feel better for being overweight and to justify these choices that you've made, which are terrible, terrible choices. Like there's no benefit whatsoever to being overweight, right?

Speaker 1:          01:36:08       No, I mean, being overweight, being overweight is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease, increased risk for type two diabetes, increased risk for cancer, increased risk of stroke in prison. You know, it's, it's increased rate of Alzheimer's disease. It's yeah, so I mean having an increased risk for all of those age related diseases is not good to them. Articles written about the positive benefits being overweight. I haven't seen those. You see if you can find some of that Jamie,

Speaker 2:          01:36:36       people that are fat that are just trying to use confirmation bias and locked into whatever small, weird statistic might exist in regards to like maybe they'd get over like a cold better or something. It's like it's really dumb.

Speaker 1:          01:36:51       Actually. Obesity starts to cause I'm immunosenescence because and and problems with your immune system because people that are overweight or obese, they, they have a lot more inflammation in their body and inflammation takes a lot of energy. Here it is. Five surprising health benefits of being overweight. Being overweight carries a reduced Chris Rheumatoid arthritis. It's because your joints are all greased up. I'd like to see the references on that. Being overweight means

Speaker 2:          01:37:21       you're less likely to develop dementia. Being overweight can make a stronger immune system. Yeah. See, that's one of the things that I had read, like what? Hold on. Is it possibly to be fit healthy and fat, to be fats to Farian? What does that mean? Frat staffy in what does that. What does that word to protect your body from possible harm. Rendering potential problems. Harmless even before incursion to explain on a slightly more plain level, the cytologists are proposing that you're extra bulk works like a blubbery barrier. Indeed, the big men, Danny Ross who was stabbed, all that's different that someone was stabbed. Somebody fell 20 feet and Lawrence Bell Hus, Blah Blah Blah Blah, or po, po portly poster boys for the defensive qualities of flat, but that's ridiculous. That's like, that's like wearing armor. You know you're talking about someone like. Yeah, physically, if you're that something that around police, if you physically, if you have like all this extra fat on your body and something hits you.

Speaker 2:          01:38:22       Yeah. You've got like a wall between you, your actual organs and your, your bones and this. This impact that's so stupid though. Being overweight is linked to increase longevity and recovery time. What know? Now it's not. Scroll down. I'm not saying is it okay to, to fat shame overweight men. Make that larger police kitten oaks, that fat tissue as well as hormones it releases, improves bodily defense mechanisms by providing vital energy reserves and anti inflammatory agents. As a result, despite overweight individuals being more susceptible to serious health issues to begin with, they are less likely to die from them than those who are underweight or even with healthy BMI is heart disease, for example, is four times more likely to claim the life of somebody with a healthy Bmi than an individual considered overweight. This is horseshit. It is. This is not absolutely opposite. No studies that the onion. Is this a forest? No. No. What is the. What is the website? The Telegraph. Whether articles too is just the one I figured would have the scroll. Scroll down a little further and being overweight can mean you're better in the bedroom. Oh, shut the fuck up. This is a fat guy. Fat Guy wrote this hormones, found in abdominal fat, allow men to last longer in the bedroom bowl.

Speaker 1:          01:39:41       I'd like to see the references for any of these statements because actually it's quite the opposite. Being overweight or being obese, it's associated with seven years off your life span, extremely obese is 14 years off your life span. Um, obesity is the number one risk factor for heart disease and type two diabetes. Um, it also is associated with massive inflammation.

Speaker 2:          01:40:01       What's this? The Journal of sexual medicine inside on pathogenesis. Genesis of lifelong premature ejaculation. Inverse relationship between lifelong premature ejaculation and obesity. Yeah, but you know what, that's because of the obese guys aren't getting laid and they probably jerk off so much. They can last forever. This is a stupid study. That's it. This is an association. There's some premature ejaculation. Has to do with anxiety, has to do a lot. There's a lot of factors involved and premature ejaculation and what exactly is premature? I mean it's a completely relative and subjective term because if you come and you enjoyed it, it was perfectly timed. It's not premature. I mean it's just like you didn't hold on. I mean the whole idea of holding on as long as a cultural construct holding on as long as you can. I mean that's just, we've decided that that's a good thing. I mean obviously for mutually

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       mutually beneficial pleasurable experience for your partner. Yeah, it's probably last longer than you know, that's what woman would like, but. But what is pr? It's not premature. The, the, the end goal is to try to breed. It's try to procreate, right? Is if you get it in there and as long as you get it in there, it's not premature. Like biologically speaking, it sounds like it's pretty subjective there. Their definition of premature. I mean what does that mean? Let the idea that you can connect all those things and say that there's some sort of a positive benefit to being fat. That's click bait bullshit. That's what that is. There's, there's very

Speaker 1:          01:41:30       strong evidence of everything. The opposite of what you just read. Yeah. Like I just don't even. I, I really just don't even know where they came from. Maybe some crappy associative studies that were done, but I mean the large body of,

Speaker 3:          01:41:43       of the literature shows the opposite, but isn't that way confusing when you see things like that, like in the Telegraph that probably got read by a million plus people or more worldwide? Probably even more than that. It's irritating. It's crazy. Yeah, but those are the kinds of articles that people will use to justify their poor life choices and this was this same kind of thing. Not that article in particular is what I'd read about when someone was talking about fat shaming. I'm like, come on, man. There's no such thing as fat shaming. Look, it's. It's rude to be mean to people. Yeah. It's rude to like pointed someone laugh because they're fat, but to suggest that someone being overweight is bad for the health is not fat shaming. It's just fact.

Speaker 1:          01:42:23       Yeah, and it's also, you're, you're trying to help someone you want to say, look, you know, there, there have we know mechanism. We know there's been studies that show that being overweight causes inflammation. It's your immune system's constantly being active and not get crosses into the brain and causes depression. It causes anxiety, it causes learning and memory problems. So you may not be working and that's been shown. You may not be working at your optimum, you know, being overweight, you could feel better, you know, so it's, it's kind of ridiculous. I think I agree with you and I have friends that are overweight and I've always been the person that I'm all, I feel like I'm lecturing, you know, because it's always, I'm always like all these benefits and I rattle off all this stuff and all this information and then there's a certain point it's like this person probably has gets defensive and doesn't want to hear it, but I care about them and that's actually part of the reason I started making videos and doing what I do without my fitness actually because I was constantly doing this to friends and family members, people I cared about where it was like at least if you put something out there, like if you put a video out there or an article or a podcast or something, they don't feel like you're targeting them.

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       So then you can just go, oh yeah, I talked about that. You should go check it out. You know, and you know what it does. It seems because people would get less defensive.

Speaker 3:          01:43:41       Well, it seems to me that there's a certain amount of information just won't get through some people's wall. They have a wall, this is what I like to do. I like to eat cake. That's it. And then you know, like, Hey, KC has sugar and sugar is bad and being obese is bad and cancer and blood pressure and uh, sorry it's not getting in. I'm going home. I'll have some fucking cake. It's kind of a rule like that mouth pleasure that they get from shoving that cake and oh, they just can't wait. And then the craving, you know, we had talked quite a bit about gut bacteria because of your experience with probiotics and also your experience with antibiotics from recovering from staph infection and how devastating was to your immune system. I started going down the rabbit hole with a gut bacteria after that because I just found it so fascinating how long it took you to recover and how a common that experiences from large doses of antibiotics, how devastating it is to the immune system to overall health wellness per the way you feel the way you like, your mood, your mood.

Speaker 3:          01:44:46       So many different effects. One of the things that I've found when I was eating a lot of bread and pasta is that I would have a good meal, like say I would have like chicken with maybe some vegetables or something like that, a nice big healthy meal and I would still be hungry afterwards for sugar. I would like my body. I was stuffed like I ate like half a chicken. I'll eat a half a chicken and my body was like, we need a cookie. I need a cookie. Come on man. Give me a cookie. Like I need some ice cream. There was, there was, there was some gut bacteria craving and that's what it seemed like. It seemed like some bizarre craving. It wasn't a craving like I needed more calories.

Speaker 1:          01:45:27       Where were you eating these? Like was this. Would you typically eat something that's refined sugar? Yes. Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Well, something. This is an interesting effect and sorry if I cut you off, but something that does happen when you eat refined sugars, like something, not a piece of fruit which has the fiber matrix and all these polyphenols. By the way, polyphenols are plant insecticides. It's all we were talking about has all this other good stuff. When you take the refined sugar away from that, what happens is when your your gut, so your gut digest it and it refined sugar usually is like a glucose mol. It's 50 percent glucose and 50 percent fructose, and that's sucrose and that's what's in table. Sugar is what's in a lot of refined sugars and what happens is that when you cleave the sucrose in the end, you cleaned the sucrose to this glucose and the fructose, the fruit toast itself doesn't get absorbed by all the cells.

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       It only gets metabolized in the liver and it does something. It's called ATP trapping. So what it does is it traps ATP, which is the source of energy, and it does this because it's trying to like do this whole other complicated enzymatic reaction, blah, blah, blah. Right? But what it does is trap the ATP and this sends a signal through the vagal nerve to your brain. I don't have energy, and so you don't get satiated. And so when you eat refined sugars, and this is independent from the gut bacteria craving stuff you're talking about, I'm not exactly sure how all that works, but what I'm talking about is real. It's ATP trapping and it's. It's, it's, it's something that is known to be a cause of y. You can eat a bunch of fructose and refined sugar and not be satiated, and so you have to eat more because your body, your brain thinks you haven't been fed because the APP has been trapped.

Speaker 1:          01:47:16       It's called ATP trapping. That's one possibility that could be, could have been happening. It's really, it's also why a lot of people that eat a lot of refined sugars with sucrose or high fructose corn syrup is the worst when they eat that. Why is high fructose Corn Syrup to worse? Because then so when your gut, so the way your gut. Okay, let's just. Let's compare table sugar. Sucrose or high fructose corn syrup. Both are bad, but when you compare the two, because sucrose is got, it's got glucose. I mean it's got glucose and fructose, high fructose corn syrup does to you. It has more fructose, but the thing is, is that, um, when it, when the sucrose sees your gut, your gut has something in it called sue crazes, which clique, which it takes, basically it's, it's slower to cleave and digest the sugar, so it's not like a big bolus at your gut sees, so it's not as irritating on the gut because it has the first, the suit crazes have to cleave the suit gross and so like all this stuff is happening.

Speaker 1:          01:48:14       Whereas when you get the high fructose corn syrup, that doesn't happen. It's a big bolus and it's like, it literally like causes a breakdown in your gut barrier. It's like irritant. It's an irritant. The same thing can happen if you take too much of, um, I mean there's lots of other things that happen, but if you take too much like magnesium or something, people can get gut irritation. It's a big bolus on the gut and it's irritant and that's what high fructose corn syrup does. And there's also then the whole atp trapping thing is like exponential with high fructose corn syrup, fructose. It's compounded. There's a bunch of different factors. There's a bunch of different factors. Of course, the fructose is very different in fruit because the matrix, the fiber, it's digested differently. It's. It's completely different than taking a table sugar or high fructose corn syrup.

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       Who's the monster that extracted that stuff? I mean, it's so bad windows that done. When do they figure out how to do that? I mean they used to do cane sugar rose. I don't know. I don't know. I know there's people that are super into to all that stuff, but yeah, it's cheaper. That's why it's cheaper and it's hidden. It's in everything. If you go out and go to a Chili's and think they're going to eat healthy, you order a salad and there's like 60 grams of sugar in there. Waldorf Salad because it's all in the dressing. High Fructose Corn Syrup. That's insane. Okay. Here it is. The 1970. It was first introduced to food and beverage industry of high fructose corn Syrup was first introduced to the food and beverage industry in the 19 seventies. That's amazing that that stuff from 1970 until today, so in the the last 40 plus years has become a massive part of our diets.

Speaker 1:          01:49:53       The average this was published and it was like the Health Organization and somewhere in the UK and whatever they call that. There were some health organization and UK that that did a press release and said that the average five-year-old consumes 50 grams of sugar a day. Oh my God. Sorry. Yeah, 50 grams to 50 grams a day or that 50 grand a year and two grams a day. That's 50 grams a day. Which was their weight. It was okay. Now I'm remembering it was. Yeah, it would be awesome. It was 50 grams a day, which was the average of their entire body weight. Have a five year old a year, a year, so if you have a bag of sugar the size of a five year old, five year old eat that in the year. Exactly. She's and I did some calculations that comes out to like a pumpkin spice latte at starbucks which has like 64 grams of sugar.

Speaker 1:          01:50:41       It's, it's crazy and everything. There's a particular type of gut bacteria, they crave sugar and that thrives on sugar though, isn't there? Um, you know, yeast are surviving on sugar, but they're not gut bacteria. You're, there was like a, a documentary, an online thing that I watched on the various documentary on different gut bacteria, so that attracted to, so I don't, maybe this is, I know that so that your gut bacteria with what they eat is fiber and they're mostly in your colon. And so when you're, when you eat fiber deficient diet, um, proteins, lipids, sugars are all absorbed in the upper intestine, but your, your bacteria in your gut starve and in order to stop themselves from starving, they start to cannibalize the gut barrier that they live on because it's got carbohydrates. And so low fiber diet can cause massive gut barrier breakdown.

Speaker 1:          01:51:42       It's actually the most in terms of magnitude, the most potent thing that regulates gut health is fiber. So is that like irritable bowel syndrome, things along those lines? Well, that can, that can happen, but you don't have to have irritable bowel syndrome to have your gut barrier breaking down. You know, you can have a low level of inflammation, not know it, but there are certain types of bacteria that can thrive in the condition. Now maybe that maybe let's say you have a low fiber diet, meaning you're eating a lot of refined sugar, so it's Kinda like the same, right? You're eating a bunch of refined sugar and in place of plants and fiber rich foods, there's a certain type of bacteria that can thrive on low fiber and it's a type of bacteria, I don't know the name of, but they have little flagella things that like move, you know, sperm sperm it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       Yeah, exactly like that. And so they'll like swim up. So your bacteria are supposed to be in the colon, let very, very end of your intestines. Right? They're not supposed to be. You're not supposed to have a bunch of bacteria in your small intestine will. They'll swim up to the small intestine because that's where the food, that's where the and the sugars and the lipids are all getting absorbed. They'll swim up there and this is often referred to as bacterial overgrowth. Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is what the technical term is, bacterial overgrowth is actually when your bacteria are starting to grow in your small intestine and what happens is when you have bacteria in your small intestine, it releases something called Zonulin and this work has all been done by Eliseo Fasano and he's, I think he's at like Massachusetts Children Hospital and he discovered this so you know, he's a rockstar for figuring this stuff out, but so when you have this, this intestinal overgrowth released something called Zonulin.

Speaker 1:          01:53:23       Zonulin is also, which are released when gluten, when your body sees gluten Zonulin, um, it literally, like you have the gut barrier and there's like these junctions with the barrier, it opens up the junctions, the tight junctions, and then people that don't have like Celiac or they don't have a really, really poor gut health. It closed. It's like a transients like open, close, open, close. And so when they open, your inflammatory cells can see the bacteria that's there. Usually the barrier separates them because what did, what do immune cells do when they see bacteria fire away? More so the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth does that and so does, so gluten gluten also causes Zonulin to be released, but um, so that would cause like bloating and inflammation, you know, things like that. Wow. God, it's just so. It's so crazy how much your diet actually affects your overall health and how few people really consider it when they're thinking about what they're eating and the consequences of what they're eating and your brain, what tastes good and your brand.

Speaker 1:          01:54:27       If it's, you know, having low inflammation is key for your brain. All these different factors that are playing on inside your body. Like all this stuff. I know. Yeah. No, I'm eating a diet that's high in fiber. That's one of the reasons why I actually, I eat a lot of wide diversity because there's lots of different types of fiber. There's you fibers, not just like one nutrient, you know, people always treat at me, oh, can I take Pectin, can I, can I take insulin and you know, which is a type of fiber. And it's like, well yeah you can, but you know, these different types of bacteria. So many different types of bacteria and they are, they're eating different types of fiber and we don't even know all what each of them are eating. We just, we know the best thing we can do right now is to get a broad spectrum, you know, so there's fiber in the implants, there's fiber that are called leggins and cellulose.

Speaker 1:          01:55:17       I'm in fruits, there's pectins like apple, a citrus appeal, have pectins, Beta glucans are and mushrooms. They're an oats, I'm resistant starches in legumes, beans. There's inulin which is in plants and off like onions, artichokes, garlic, and all these different types of fiber feeding, different types of factor. And that best thing you want is a diverse bacteria set. So feeding them all different types of fibers. Good. Plus you're getting all the plant hormetic compounds and then you're getting all the micronutrients, magnesium, vitaminK , I'm fully, you know, these are things that people are in, are deficient in. So I, I, I try to do that and then I eat meat. I think there was a, uh, it was, uh, uh, now that I'm thinking about it,

Speaker 3:          01:55:58       I think it was kind of like an infomercial, what you're talking about. I'm talking about the candida videos. Yes, that's exactly what they're selling a product, but I don't think I made it that far. It was long. Five minutes. Yeah, it was really long and it was disturbing. You know, you're talking about Candida growth in your stomach and how your, your, your gut is responding to all this sugar by this massive production of or massive. Here it is. So that's what happened. Sugar, the cause of Candida, Candida cause of cancer. And sugar has been shown, right, to accelerate cancer growth.

Speaker 1:          01:56:32       Yes. In fact that there was a study that was just published recently were like caused breast cancer cells to grow like four times faster.

Speaker 3:          01:56:41       Whoa. Four times faster from sugar. Refined sugar. Not from my wife's mom. She's a lovely lady, but she loves sugar. She puts sugar in everything. She makes Kale Salad and you eat it. You'll like, you're eating candy, like everything has sugar. Like, you know, it's like from her era, that's what they did. They put sugar in their cornflakes, everybody would sugar and everything and they felt like it just made things taste good. Like you're eating healthy food and skittles, sugar on it, you know, spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Remember that? Yes. You know, and it's just, it's so disturbing that people grow up thinking that this is the way to eat and it just. Nobody told them, nobody warned them and you know, she's in her sixties now and that's just how it goes to the autonomous. It's hard to God, it's fucking

Speaker 1:          01:57:27       people. Yeah. I've got, I've got loved member, loved ones that I care about that are also addicted to sugar and I try try hard. It's, it's, it is hard. Especially the older you get when you're stuck in your ways, your brain's not as able to kind of change as easily, you know? So we'll see. So you

Speaker 3:          01:57:45       don't have a lot of willpower. Some people just not good at like saying, okay, this is what, I'm not doing this anymore, you know, like this, I'm done doing that. Boom, you know, I don't know how other people's brains work, so I don't. I don't know what the pull is, but I know for me when when I try to quit something like I'm going to quit sugar, I'm there. Boy, that fucking first week or so. It was hard because the pole, it's like there's this desire to cheap go. Come on man, one cookies, not going to fuck anything up. It's not going to be that big a deal. Like there's this poll to have sugar and when I kicked sugar for, I've done it twice now, but the first time I did it, one of the most disturbing things, it was like the headaches, like two or three days in I was getting these headaches.

Speaker 3:          01:58:25       I was like, Oh my God, I'm getting sugar detox headaches. Like that's what it was. It had to be. There was the only thing that was different. I was eating all the same normal things, but I wasn't taking any sugar. Anything that has sugar, I wouldn't take it and I was getting headaches it on most people if you don't get, if you don't have a rock solid determined mentality for this type of stuff, it's really hard. Like if you're wishy washy on your diet. Well I'm just going to try to eat healthy. Like my friends have told me that before they try to lose weight. What are you doing? I'm just going to try to eat healthier. You Ain't gonna do shit. You Ain't gonna do shit. Like you have to have like a rigid set of rules. You can't say I'm just going to eat healthy because then you'll decide you're eating healthy back fucking cupcake's not gonna hurt anybody and then you'll eat that cupcake and that'll kill all your hard work. I had no idea that you were eating refined sugar like this whole time. I thought you were. You're always like vegetables. Meat. Yeah. I would occasionally I would dive in. I mean, it wasn't like a real problem, but it was enough that see if you eat protein bars like the ones that Jamie was eating over there, what does that have it? I love those goddamn things.

Speaker 3:          01:59:35       These things are great. They taste awesome. They're called pro bars. I first found out about these suckers one-on-one. A hunting. Oh, come on. Is that real? This fucker is 21 grams of sugar in it. This is crazy. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's everywhere. It's hidden everywhere. That is. God damn crazy. This is 21 grams. You're always supposed to have 25 in a day. Yep, exactly. A whole day. One yummy bar fucker is Alex your added sugar fighting two or three of those in a setting. Like after I worked out, I would eat two of those. Like if I was going to in the morning, if I was headed over here and uh, I didn't have time to eat, I'd throw to those down and a Kombucha. So the Kombucha, John Ten 10? Yeah. For grape grape cappuccinos. 10 plane has five. So, uh, I prefer plane, but sometimes the grape was all.

Speaker 3:          02:00:26       I had left, so I'd throw it out a grape that's 10 a throw down, two of those. That's 41 or 42. Jesus Christ, I mean 50 grams of sugar on the way over here, which is twice what you're supposed to have in a day. And then I might have a piece of cake, you know, I'm to eat real healthy and say I'm eating real healthy and you know, oh you want some apple pie folk? Do you want ice cream on it? Why not? And then what's that? It's probably another 30, 40, 50, 60, 70. So you're winding up with 100 plus grams of sugar in a day, right? Yeah. And this, this, this stuff is causing inflammation in your gut. It's the more, at least with you, you were still getting some of the good stuff though. It's not like you were eating a fiber deficient diet. Yeah. No, I was eating healthy on top of that, but even better than. Yeah. Than most people that are eating that stuff. This is crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy. There's a thing called a Lara bar. You ever heard lar? A. They're so yummy, they're so good, but it makes it look like you're eating something healthy. It's like the wrappings earth toned. It's like woo. I'm like, I'm doing yoga in a bar. This is. Most of those bars are really candy bars, you know. I think quest nutrition

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       is probably like, if I were to say that there's anyone that makes, makes a bar that's not a candy bar. Quest quest has some decent ones.

Speaker 2:          02:01:49       Well, um, primal kitchens has a really good one. It's a nut bar with dark chocolate and it has a tiny amount of honey in it. It's less than four grams. I'm pretty sure less than four grams of sugar per bar, but it's mostly almonds and dark chocolate. Like a little bit of honey. Those are really good. They're not, it's not sweet at all. Those I liked those and a lot of times I'll eat like a meat bars. Like there's some bars. What are the ones we have back there? Those. Yeah. One of those ones we have in the back. Jamie, what are those things? Quite. Yeah. Well, not just the ones that we sell it on it with. Those other ones that I bought about some other ones that are really good, but even some of those have fucking sugar in them. It's just amazing how sneaky they are. That God damn sure

Speaker 1:          02:02:33       didn't condiments. It's in hot sauces. Yeah. These things right here. So these fuckers, this is so, this. I got these

Speaker 2:          02:02:40       damn things. He's Paleo. Simplified them like all go paleo bar bullshit. It's got a lot of God damn sugar in all these fucking things of 15 or 19 or. Yeah. Yeah. This one is 20 Jesus Christ.

Speaker 1:          02:02:57       The uh, the lab that I was doing my postdoc in, they, they, I've talked about this before. They, they, they made it, they designed a bard intentionally to try and fill new micro nutrient gaps in people that are like obese. So like it has, it has vitamin D in it, you know, it has magnesium, vitaminK has Dha, Omega three, it has all these good micronutrients in it and then they try to put some dark chocolate so that doesn't taste like crap. Um, and sprinkle a little bit. There's very little sugar in it, but you know people don't like them because they don't taste good. This little fucker as 22, this little crazy you shouldn't eat. That disappears in my hand. This little tiny thing is 22. Imagine how many people are eating this stuff. Sugar just fucks. I think the best thing you can do is eat whole foods.

Speaker 1:          02:03:44       You can eat vegetables, you know, fruits are not that bad. You can eat a pear and apple. You can eat berries, strawberries, all these things they have. They have a variety of different good polyphenols. These plant insecticides, they've got fiber, they've got some micronutrients and they taste really good. They taste good like a peach, a really good peach. Oh my God. They're delicious and it's something that we've gotten, so we. We've just gotten so used to it. We'll take it for granted. You know, if you had a desert and it tastes like a delicious peach, you'd be like, Ooh, this is a wonderful dessert because it's a peach, like it's good for you. Yeah. It's almost like we want that bad for you. Rush. It's like were naughty on top of the fact that we're, we're eating something, we're getting like the mouth pleasure from it and we're also getting the naughtiness like, Ooo, the cake.

Speaker 1:          02:04:34       How much of that is a learned response as well? You know, my, my postdoc advisor or Bruce Ames, he's 87 years old, going on 88 and I've been to many different dinner parties at his house and he's American and his wife is Italian so she immigrated here from Italy. But every single time I go to a dinner party the dessert is always fresh fruit. I mean it's just like super normal, like it's, it's always fresh. Some sort of fresh fruit medley. She'll cut up and sometimes she'll put some little bit of some alcohol or something on there. I'm like, I'm moretto or you know, but it's always fresh fruit and that's like, they've been doing this for 50 years. That's been their dessert. Fresh fruit, you know. So that was good though. He's good. Chocolate cake is better. Dark, dark chocolate. Dark chocolate has a lot of good stuff in it, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:05:26       So that the dark, dark chocolates. One, I think that people that are really craving that can can feel good because there's, there's ecg and dark chocolate, which is what's in green tea. UGC is one of those normal plant compounds that are doing a a hormetic response. It's been shown to cause brain cells to grow. It's anti cancer, it kills cancer cells. It also is really good for your skin, prevents your skin. Collagen is being broken down and it has a really high reading of antioxidants. Right? Well that's what I'm talking about. These, they're not. People get confused antioxidants. There are antioxidants in fruits and vegetables, but in dark chocolate, the antioxidants are the hormetic compounds that are causing your antioxidant genes to be expressed is a big difference and there's really like, there's no comparison. Like if you're, you know, you need a certain amount of vitamin E which has antioxidant, you need a certain amount of vitamin C which is an antioxidant and a cofactor.

Speaker 1:          02:06:26       You need it to make Collagen, but in just like the antioxidant form, it pales in comparison to like glutathione related enzymes. We have super oxide dismutase. All these systems that we have in our body that are designed to prevent these things called oxidation or oxidative stress, stress from happening. So when you're taking, in fact some people, um, they have a uh, so we have this gene that can use glutathione in our body, takes the glutathione that we make in our body and it puts it to like prevent damage from happening to ourselves. There are people that have more. I'm more active version of this, that if they take vitamin D supplemental, that it actually does them harm. Really? Yeah. Because that, because what happens is the body goes, oh, I've got this vitamin E, it's doing that job. And so the enzyme doesn't get active when you have the stress there, the enzymes not active.

Speaker 1:          02:07:21       This is a certain gene polymorphism in the GSTP one gene. So how would someone find that out there? What they have to have 23 and me 23 and me, um, is a genetic test that tests for a variety of these polymorphisms. And um, there's the, they give a, a report that's kind of, they don't tell you about that gene. You have to like, um, you can, I don't know if promethium promethium is, is a tool that's like it costs $5. I've talked about it before in your podcast and you can run your 23 and me data through it and it tells you all these polymorphisms, but that what you have and what they mean. But I also have a tool that's out today actually, right? That's a, it's a, it's the Beta version of it, so it's, it's basic functionality, but that genes on there, the GSTP one glitter found one is on there.

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       So, um, this tool that I've got out is free so people can use it for free and I'm going to add a bunch more genes to it, but right now there's a, there's a basic set of genes that are interested in genes that are involved in making vitamin D. can you convert the vitamin D three? You're taking into the steroid hormone or vitamin D three you get from the sun. Some people have a polymorphism where they don't do that as well. There it is right there, there it is. Rhonda is genetic report and this.com forward slash genetics.

Speaker 3:          02:08:34       It's amazing to me that every time you come on the podcast there's new shit that I have to remember and it seems like you're constantly learning things. That's what's crazy is that you've been studying this for so long, but it's just you're at the tip of the iceberg. It seems like there's no end of this.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       There's no end and we need crispr so that I can keep learning. It's like infinite amount. I mean I have

Speaker 3:          02:08:56       crispr for people don't know what that means. It's a relatively new method of, of altering genetic.

Speaker 1:          02:09:01       I'm going to give the thousand mile summary of it where it's basically a way to to go and fix a gene that may be like, let's say you've got some gene that you can't repair, you know the alcohol damage induced damage as well, which also increases the risk for traumatic brain injury by like tenfold. It's bad. So you say, I don't want that apoe e four gene because it's gonna lead to Alzheimer's disease. It's going to make my traumatic brain injury lead to Alzheimer's disease. You know, it's so and also does other things. Well, crispr is a technology that can go and recognize the gene you want so it recognize it's just a small sequence of DNA that you put on it. So you put this little sequence of Dna because you know what the sequence of the gene is and it recognizes it's complimentary pair and it goes in and it cuts it out and it replaces it with what you actually put there, which is the right version of it. So it can like go cut out a bad thing and put the right thing in. So it's a way of going instead of gene engineering up until Crispr, the way it was done was basically you would put a gene in and it will just go anywhere and it wouldn't replace the bad one necessarily. So this is Kinda like a whole new field. It's just like, it's like. So anyways.

Speaker 3:          02:10:17       Yeah. And there's a radiolab podcast on that as well. It's spelled C, R I s P, R. Right. And if you're interested in listening to Radiolab podcast, because it's amazing and it's also interviews of people who discovered it. And.

Speaker 1:          02:10:30       Right. Jennifer, do you see Berkeley? Yeah, I listened to some of that. It's

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       good. I think the job really good job explaining it to people so that they can understand. Um, I want to talk for a little bit about the cryotherapy because this is something that I emailed you when there was a disturbing article that was sort of Poo pooing the benefits cryotherapy in the article was I thought it was really poorly, poorly done, poorly researched. And it was also, it was studied really subjective things like how sore you felt after exercise and whether or not a benefited for them from that. But yeah, but there are real positive benefits of Cryo therapy that are measurable. Yes. And that happened as well, first of all, that article that you're referring to from that whatever website it was, but the article was Steven Novella is a guy and I think what he did is he rushed to put this article out because that woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo therapy and it was a really tragic incident.

Speaker 3:          02:11:27       She was by herself. There's two different types of cryo therapy. One of the things we should point out, first of all, I don't have any because I've been accused of this. I was just say right now I don't have any vested interest in cryotherapy. I don't own any of it. I don't. I don't make any money from it. Nothing. I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it, but this woman who did it, she did the type. There's two kinds. One of them, it goes from the neck down. So you stand in this booth. Your head is above breathing and normal oxygen, but below you is liquid nitrogen. You can't read that stuff in. That's why your head is not under. If you do breathe that stuff in, you don't have any oxygen. You'll black out and that's what happened to her. She did it by herself.

Speaker 3:          02:12:05       It was poorly set up and apparently she was quite short so her head was kind of below the, the, the limit where you're supposed to be with. So she was breathing in the liquid nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked out. So I thought she was full on. No, no, no. The full on ones are much rarer. And what the full on ones do is they super cool the air with the nitrogen. So the air itself is pumped in really cool. I did. Yes. That's what you did. And that's what we're going to do today too, if you have the time to. Okay, let's get that one. You can breathe in. It's just fucking unbelievably cold. Okay. So the one that she did was she set up by herself, which you're never supposed to do. You're always supposed to have supervision. So it wasn't whether or not.

Speaker 3:          02:12:51       I mean she's the only person I've ever heard of this died from this. And it's a horrible, tragic committing suicide. No, no. She was just worried there. And sometimes women will, um, they'll put their face under it because they want the effects of a cryo facial because cryo facial has been shown to improve Collagen and flattens your therapy, actually prevents it star, it inhibits enzymes that break down and called college and aces. And that's actually part of the reason it helps with arthritis. Arthro college and a's is break down collagen and they break down like, you know, the tendons college and around the tendons and stuff. And it can cause arthritis, arthritic pain. So doing it would make sense why you'd want to do something because it would have an effect on your skin.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       Yeah. Women love it when they get their face down. Apparently they get or vein men to or any man, hello, you don't have to be vain to college. But the point being that article came out and all these people were saying, Oh see, I told Ya, cryotherapy was bullshit. I'm like, oh my God, what a Piss poor article. And it was all talking about soreness. And one of the things that he said that really drove me crazy was you, you'd get just as much benefit from a cool down and stretch after a workout. I'm like, tell that to these fucking people that I see that go there all the time, that do it twice a day because they have severe arthritis and it's the only thing that's given them any form of, of, of freedom, of movement of their hands. Like I know a bunch of people that go there that have had some really debilitating arthritis and this has given them a relief where nothing else was given it to them other than like pretty severe pharmaceutical drugs or Ibuprofen at high levels or what you were talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       Like there's a lady that goes to my thing, but she was raving about how she can finally stretch your hands out. Like her hands had been like locked in this position for years. Yeah, it has. I mean the cold itself as a paramedic stressor that is activating a variety of antiinflammatory pathways, antioxidant pathways. You know, and it's also last time I think on the podcast we talked about, it increases norepinephrine, epinephrine itself. It can, so cryotherapy and cold water immersion are two forms of of cold exposure. Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase norepinephrine. Twofold. That's twofold over what you were before you went in and nor epinephrin. In addition to the brain benefits we were talking about how it makes you feel good, how it helps with learning. It also is a very potent antifa inflammatory, so it inhibits the production of TNF Alpha, which is very.

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       It's kind of like in arthritis, tnf Alpha is kinda like going haywire. You're making too much tnf Alpha, and what happens is tnf alpha is a signaling molecule to or your immune cells that says, hey, there's an infection here because that's normally what happens when you release Tnf Alpha is because there's some bacteria or some something that you need to kill and so your immune cells, all they see is the signal. They don't know what's causing it. They don't know that it's because your gut cells and your immune cells in your gut are seeing bacteria because of your poor diet or whatever, and so that's getting into the bloodstream and causing chronic inflammation. It doesn't know that it. All it knows is that this means there's a threat and so they start to increase the production of your immune cells make hypochlorite, which is like bleach.

Speaker 1:          02:16:02       So you're making bleach in your body to kill things and that's happening chronically. That's going to cause some tissue damage is going to cause pain. It also, they also make hydrogen peroxide. You make that. Your immune cells will make that so cryotherapy inhibits the signaling molecule so that your immune cells quiet down because now they're not seeing that signal that says, come on, hey, fire up, fire up. It's not there. So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf alpha. And like I said, with the college as well. Um, but there are so many. I did, you know, I just spent two weeks just researching and reading. I've been doing some cold exposures, you know, like cold shower and also jumping in the ocean ice bath and I really liked the cryo therapy that I did last time we were here and uh, you know, so I've been very interested in it, like understanding why you feel so good.

Speaker 1:          02:16:51       And so I did some reading on it and there's so many different positive hormetic benefits from doing cryotherapy. So you have, you know, the, the, the anti-inflammatory part and this, and this also, it's been shown that doing like 10 sessions of cryotherapy in a row, it increases the expression of glutathione reductase by two fold and another glue of the fly on related enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68 percent. And these are these enzymes like you can be taking all the lyposomal glutathione you want, like it's not going to matter if you don't have the enzyme's active to use it. So you could take lyposomal glutathione and that's great. You're increasing your, you make glutathione inside of yourselves. But, um, we, we can't make as much of it as we get older, but if you take it and you don't have the enzymes that use it to actually do the good stuff active, that it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          02:17:44       So cryotherapy was shown to activate to different glutathione related enzymes, which is pretty awesome. So it would enhance your body's ability to absorb glutosiome no, it doesn't enhance your body's ability to absorb it. It enhances your body's ability to use it. So if you fight off bad, good violin and then you're using cryotherapy, it would enhance it. Um, so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal glutathione that you take, all that does is increase glutathione inside of yourselves. Glutathione inside of your cells does nothing without enzymes that use it to, uh, to basically sequester damaging inflammatory things. And the cryotherapy increased activates the enzymes that use it. So it's like, great, I have all this gludethyon sitting around on myself that I've been taking. And I also now have the enzymes that use it to do good stuff. Now are being turned on that. What was very interesting is that it took like multiple sessions before, before those got like 10 to 2010 and one at least 10 and you have and then the other side he was 20, so it was it consecutively at day, 10 days in a row.

Speaker 1:          02:18:50       Yeah, 10 days in a row. But the first day I didn't do it. So that, that was also very interesting. So it's almost like your body is saying, okay, this crazy fuck of some response. Yep. Yeah. Your body is preparing for war. It's like it's stressful, you know? It's a stressful response. The other thing that's really cool that we didn't talk about last minute podcast is the thermogenic effect when you, when you release nor norepinephrine. So that's. I keep going back to that because it's like you can't refute that. Steve Novella, no one know debunker skeptic. No, I don't care who you are. You can't. It's just, it's consistent in every type of cold exposure period. It's, it's, it's consensus. You release norepinephrine.

Speaker 3:          02:19:32       Well, there always seems to be some sort of a rationalization with a lot of the debunking, like whether it's the benefits of exercise, whether it's a benefits of Cryo therapy. That's almost like a rationalization for not doing it. It's like you're looking for an excuse to not do it and not really very objective. Yes. That was, which was disturbing about. It's like this is like you're poopooing

Speaker 1:          02:19:53       people grape. Yeah. Yeah. I, it was clear. I mean after especially especially after the two weeks of research, I mean, I think there's a kind of mentality when you're. Sometimes people like to think I'm a debunker and I'm not, I am, I am intentionally. Like, because if you get in this mentality of always debunking something, you're, it's like the spiral and you can't see the good. Like you can't keep an open mind to like get past. You're like, what's in your box that you know, and that's very dangerous. I think that, and I think a lot of blind spots it is and, and there are a lot of scientists that I know they're very smart, extremely smart, but they are in that loop where it's like just they have to debunk and criticized and it's like, you know, at some point huge discoveries are made by like connecting the dots and getting past that. Like, I mean you have to be critical. Being critical is very important, but you also like, I think there's a certain threshold where you just start to like, you know, you get to the spiral.

Speaker 3:          02:20:50       Well it was also was infuriating about this is the data's out there. This is not like it's not, there's no data. It's like he made a cursory examination of the evidence and what he chose to focus on was it was so subjective. It was focused on a study that tested muscle soreness, posts, exercise with cryotherapy.

Speaker 1:          02:21:09       No, actually the study that he referred to as a Meta analysis and it was subjective, but it actually came to the conclusion that there were benefits. However, it said more studies and that needed to be done because there wasn't large enough sample sizes and the quality of data was poor because there were not double blinded placebo controlled clinical trials and I have to say to you so that, so they're actually what he resided in that article. There was a positive effect of the cow. But the problem is, is that because they followed that up with, oh, well, it's poor quality, basically poor science. The reality is, is that you can't do a double blinded placebo control controlled trial with cryotherapy. Like you're, you're going to be cold and you're going to be putting this chamber where there's like cold or you're not, and you're going to know if you're cool, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:21:56       So anyways, I thought that was ridiculous. I just like whatever. I'm in Oregon. I'm going to read about this stuff because I know I've experienced that. There's definitely something going on. Um, and one of the things that happens is the norepinephrine. And when he released, when you released that norepinephrine, it activates a pathway in, inside of your cells that basically are causes your energy metabolism, metabolism to ramp up because you're trying to generate heat, you want basically your wants to. Your body is saying, I don't want to die, I need to make heat. And so a couple of ways it can do that. One, it can shiver and shivering is when your muscles start to contract and that it requires energy for your muscles to like twitch. It's very, um, it's not very thermodynamically favorable. So you, it's not a good way to generate heat but you generate heat because you have to like ramp up to twitch.

Speaker 1:          02:22:48       But then what happens after you've been exposed? And actually this happens to me because we did the crowd twice. The first time I did it, I was shivering like the entire time I was shivering it was really crazy because I've never shivered like that in my life. But the second time I went in I did not shiver. And after reading about it, what happens is your body quickly adapt. So you adapt. And what happens is non shivering thermogenesis, so the nor epinephrin causes your Mitochondria, which are the energy producing little organelles inside of yourselves, well, it causes them in your, in your adipose tissue to get activated. And it does this by increasing the expression of a gene called UCP, one which basically freaks your mitochondria out because your mitochondria are kind of like batteries. They're charged, they have a negative charge on the inside and a positive charge on the outside.

Speaker 1:          02:23:33       Will ucp one totally uncouples that so that there's no more charge. And that charge is very important because when that charges is there, your body knows, okay, I've been making energy because the way you make the charge is by making energy. So when the charge goes away, your body's like, Oh my God, I've got no energy. So it just starts to ramp up fat metabolism. So it does that, and you start to make more mitochondria. So you're, you're making more mitochondria in your fat cells. And this is often called Brown fat, so you can actually. The reason it's called Brown fat is because when you look at a fat cell under the microscope, if it has more mitochondria than it looks Brown, so you actually start to burn fat and you have this thermogenic because you're burning fat. It's creating heat as a byproduct so you're warming your body, but it has this nice side effect of burning fat, which people like.

Speaker 1:          02:24:19       And the more you expose yourself to the cold, the more you're browning your fat, the more you're increasing those mitochondria, your fats, which means the next time you're in the cold, you can tolerate it longer. So people that have been exposing themselves to cold like yourself when you're doing the Cryo, you know, often you actually can tolerate the colder for longer periods of time because you have more mitochondria in your fat cells. And this allows you to then generate more heat. So, and this has been shown in people, people that have been exposed to a cold, that they have been shown to increase their, their, um, Brown adipose tissue by like 38 percent. If they're exposed to 10 days of 50 degree air, like outside air. Just regular air, 50 degrees all, all day, 10 days, so like six hours a day out in like, you know, New York in the, I don't know, pretty winter or fall, I don't know, something like that being out there for six hours for 10 days in a row.

Speaker 1:          02:25:10       Men were able to increase their brown adipose tissue by like 38 percent or something like that. So people from the east coast or from the northeast, the move to California and then they go back during the winter, they go home, my blood got too thin. Was really is there really is like a physical factor of your body not being accustomed to dealing with colby. You adapt, you adapt. And that's what Brown adipose tissue. And that's really one cold. How cold got really popular. Popularized because people wanted to use it as a hack to lose weight, you know? So they were like, Oh, if I do these cold showers, I use it for the brain benefits because I noticed I feel really good and also more focused. So I like that. And a lot of people I've talked to have felt the same way. Um, but then I think the other part of this article was the, the effects of it blunting some of the strength training and you know, I talk about this in this report that I wrote or the in the podcasts that I released on and it's so complicated I had to like sit there and literally just read for like two weeks to try to figure it out because you know, the problem is, is that exercise is a hormetic stress.

Speaker 1:          02:26:11       Cold is a hormetic stress. So exercise itself, you need some of the inflammation, you need the bad stuff to get the good stuff. That's how it works. But you know, the inflammation that's happening happens while you're exercising and up to one hour after, one hour after. That's when the whole hormetic response kicks in. And this has been shown in multiple studies. One hour seems to be when the anti inflammatory response kicks in. So you've generated the implementation and then now you've got the antiinflammatory effects. If you do a cold exposure within that hour after exercising, it's possible. You may blunt some of the inflammatory effects that the exercise is inducing because the cold is activating anti inflammatory genes too early. Now, I don't know that for certain, but I do know that this, this study that showed there was one study that showed strength training. If you did it, there were, if you did cryotherapy immediately, like mediafly after a Cold War, it was actually cold water immersion, which is not the same as the Cryo cryo chamber that it blended some of the anabolic signaling.

Speaker 1:          02:27:13       And so there was like some of the muscle mass was, was not gained, but you know, there's other studies that have been done that have shown for some reason. All the endurance guys, they always wait an hour. It's kind of weird. So what I'm wondering is if people that are doing this research like sit down, take a step back, you know, people are always in this. I got to Polish it. How to publish, you know, there's a real big publisher parish mentality and science where it's like your bread and butter depends on your publishing and so you're just constantly trying to get that data out there, but you really, I think things are so complicated just to sit down and take a look at everything that's out there and start to go wait a minute. There's lots of little details that need to be considered to design this trial correctly.

Speaker 1:          02:27:55       So I'm hoping that at least for those people doing strength training that they'll do one where they actually wait until an hour because there's been other studies where that strength to strength training in combination with cryotherapy done much later. Even the next day there were actually benefits, performance benefits. Like they able to do more of those leg curl things. I don't know what they called leg extensions. Those, you know. So, you know, I don't really know what's going on, but what I do know is that it seems as though it's very likely that during the crowd therapy, like immediately after and now. Then again, if you're, if you're talking about someone that's doing, um, like there's been studies that have been published showing that people that are doing two bouts of exercise, so they're like riding a bike and then they, they're waiting whatever, 30 minutes and then they go and run or something.

Speaker 1:          02:28:44       If they do cold water immersion in between those, they actually have performance enhancements. You know, if they, if they wait, I'm sorry, I have to do it between two bouts of exercise. Some of that's due to the fact that cold, the cold water, it seems to improve heart rate variability. It x has been shown to improve it by like two to three fold. So heart rate variability is the change in oscillation between heartbeats and it's also, um, people, people judge a, the heart recovery from a workout. So as soon as you're done with an intense workout, the ability of your heart rate to lower immediately within minutes, that's like a marker of heart rate variability. And it's supposed to be good because your parts able to deal with these stressful changes, you know, because when you're making cortisol or something, your heart starts racing more or some of these other stress hormones, uh, so it's been shown to improve that and having her being able to have your heart rate slower right after a workout and then you're immediately going to do a workout again.

Speaker 1:          02:29:38       You can imagine there would be an performance enhancement with, with that. So there's also, there's a difference in the physiological response between cold water immersion and Cryo therapy, right? Well, it depends, um, you know, if there, there are differences in the ability for those two different modalities to extract heat from the body, you know, if we're talking about submerging ourselves and cold water up to our shoulders, um, water or ice is a much better. It's much better at extracting heat from the body, then error. Um, but surface area also plays a role and, and the temperature change. So if you're sitting in cold water that's 57 degrees, that's not as cold as going into a minus 180 or whatever crowd chamber. But you can also sit in the cold water for a lot longer, so I do it for 15 minutes. I think that there has been a study that compared the norepinephrine release, 20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the shoulders is comparable to two minutes at a minus standard, something one 80 minus one 84, no norepinephrine, but a lot of the effects are mediated from nor norepinephrine, but listened to 20 seconds at 40 to reverse those two minutes.

Speaker 1:          02:30:52       So imagine, imagine staying in the water for five minutes in that. And this has been shown. So if you have someone that stays in water 57 degree water for an hour, they increased their norepinephrine by fivefold instead of twofold. So you have a more robust response. So it could be good, but it could be bad if you're talking about doing it right after a strength training session and jump into cold water for five minutes. That could. That could have some very potent antiinflammatory effects. So the best way to handle it would be to wait at least an hour, I think. Yeah, that makes sense. What about a anti inflammatory markers in the blood? So there have been studies that have shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive protein, which would be an inflammatory marker, and then the glutathione related enzymes going up and also superoxide dismutase, that would be a marker for inflammation because there's also a decrease inflammation when you have more of those.

Speaker 1:          02:31:48       So, so cryotherapy does. And then also, um, there's been mark measurements of TNF Alpha going down. Like I said, I'm also another marker that macrophages release macrophage inhibitory protein or something, some inflammatory, you know, a molecule that's made, there's less of it when you, when Cold War, I can't remember if as cold water immersion or cryotherapy, but it's cold exposure. So. And that was mediated through norb and ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of stuff. It's, it's mediating the brain effects. It's mediating the thermogenesis. It's antiinflammatory, it's anti pain. People get injected with norepinephrine and their spine to alleviate a pain. Yes, because it's anti inflammatory. Wow. Jesus. There's probably other things going on as well. So science just science, just the hard science. There's plenty of evidence that there's benefits to grow therapy. Oh yeah, so why would I write an article like that? I'm like, I said there's the, there's the bad article that was the anabolic blunting effects which was done immediately after exercise, which made a huge splash because it's like, Whoa, you're right, your gains.

Speaker 1:          02:32:53       Um, and then you have the, the, the hardcore are very skeptical people that are like, well, the quality of data, you know. Well, the thing is, is that there's a large body of data and sometimes if you can't have a double blinded placebo controlled trial, then you have to look at mechanism. You have to look at animal studies combined with human studies. You have to understand what's going on. You can't refute the norepinephrine. We know that norepinephrine is doing all these things, you know. So I think you just have to be very comprehensive, especially when the, when you know, there's the argument that the, there's no placebo controlled trials or you know, it's too subjective, but there's lots of ways that it's not subjective. And this has been measured in people. People have measured the direct approach and they've measured these enzyme activities. They've measured these inflammatory molecules.

Speaker 1:          02:33:38       And people also in animals, you know, so there's, I, I'm confident when I say that there are absolutely health benefits from doing cold exposure for your brain, anti-inflammatory, for, for thermogenesis, you know, being able to your, if you can, this is actually a, a, a target a lot. I know a lot of researchers that are working on this, they're trying to um, find a way to pharmacologically brown fat because it increases fat burning and weight loss. So we will, of course, it always, people always try to do that with, I prefer the, the, the cold exposure. But other things do at fish oil was shown to recently do that to increase a brown Brown adipose tissue. So a plant based Omega six and three's. No, no, no. That's um, so the, so the fish or it was two grams of EPA and one gram of EPA, Dha.

Speaker 1:          02:34:33       And it was, it increased fat burning by like 27 percent or something during exercise. And then at resting and increased it by something in the teens, 17 or 13 percent. And that was just at rest fat burning. And the way it was shown, the way it did, it was by increasing UCP, one, uncoupling the Mitochondria and causing your basically causing your fat to make more Mitochondria and Brown fat. Super Cool. I've been taking high doses official, but yeah, to answer your question that the plant version, and this is always a problem with a. I get this question a lot from, from people that are Vegan or vegetarian, you know, they're like, well I get my Omega three from the plant version, Alpha linolenic acid. And actually, um, there's, there's a lot of important things to consider. One is that Alpha linolenic acid is poorly converted. All these are.

Speaker 1:          02:35:22       These are, these are long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, Alpha linolenic acids. 18 EPA is 20 eicosapentaenoic acid, which is found in fish. And then Dha is 22. So you basically, your body will take the Alpha Linolenic, which is implants, flax seeds, walnuts, and it will start adding carbons on to make the other ones because you need the other one's 30 percent of your brain is made of Dha. Dha is very important. But the thing is, is that most men actually only convert about eight percent of Alpha linolenic acid into, um, into EPA and only four percent into Dha, not very much now estrogen and actually can increase that production. It can increase the gene that converts those because women are the ones that are, you know, carrying the child and Dha is very important for the developing brain, very, very important. So it makes sense that nature would make a way to be able to do that with the plant version.

Speaker 1:          02:36:20       But the thing is, is that there's been a study that showed that people that take preformed Ala Alpha linolenic acid have to take 33 point five times more than preformed Dha or EPA to get the same amount of Dha and EPA in the brain. So a lot. There's a lot. So there, there are ways around, um, there are Vegan or vegetarian friendly sources which would be micro algae oil. I think that I personally think that vegans and vegetarians should take my gradual. If I was a Vegan, which I can't ever see myself becoming one, but I would absolutely take that. Why do you not see yourself ever becoming one? Because there are important micronutrients and neat that are, that are important for a variety of physiological functions, including the brain, red blood cells. You can supplement with some stuff, but I just, I haven't convinced myself not to to eat meat. So I think with,

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       with Vegans, well, vegans, what they're trying to do is come up with a sort of an ethical work around they're trying to figure out what's, how can you be healthy and live a vegan diet and is it healthy enough and most of them, at least the hardcore proselytizing ones seem to think yes and they want everybody else to do it too.

Speaker 1:          02:37:37       There are a lot of benefits. There are a lot of positive factors to eating a more begun like diet, all the fiber you're getting begins. I mean I do know there are some begins at a lot of processed junk so they're all, you know, not everyone that's vegans healthy, but not everyone that's omnivores. Helping the ones that are eating healthy, they're getting a lot of. They're getting a watt wide broad spectrum of plants. They're getting the different fibers that getting into the micro, they're getting the good micronutrients, implants, the magnesium, the vitaminK , the full late a vitamin C, and they're getting all the. The hormetic compounds in the plant, so those. Those are really good things, but the problem is is that they're, they're more nutritionally deficient and things that most people in the western world or not because the problem with the, like the United States in general isn't that we eat enough meat here.

Speaker 1:          02:38:26       Most people, unless you're Vegan or vegetarian, people are eating enough meat there. Problem is people aren't eating enough of their Greens and so I usually focus on micronutrients that are found in Greens because that's what people are not getting enough of, but there are important micronutrients that are in meat that vegans and vegetarians are more subject to being deficient in like be 12. So 12 and iron are are two really, really important ones. Both of these are very, so b. 12 is very important for the production of neurotransmitters and Myelin in the brain, both iron and B, 12 hour. Most people think of iron as being important for your blood cells, and it is, it's, it's bound to something called team, which is a, um, a protein inside hemoglobin. It's important for transporting oxygen to your tissues because you need oxygen to make energy. So, but the other thing that iron iron is doing is it's also important for making Myelin in the brain.

Speaker 1:          02:39:21       Myelin is what surrounds the axons of your neurons and allow it allows them to communicate quickly. It allows electrical signals, signals to be trans, ported quickly. So that's important. And then make neurotransmitters like you need iron to make Serotonin in your brain. And it's one of the reasons why during pregnancy irons very, like if you have iron deficiency during pregnancy, can cause abnormal brain structure or can cause birth defects because it shapes the structure and the wiring of the brain. Um, so that's, you know, obviously here in the United States we have supplements, we have access to supplements and you know, you can take a sublingual, b 12, you know, it's, it's a little bit of a different world than it is somewhere in like a developing country.

Speaker 3:          02:40:04       But B12, it's animal base. So how are they getting a plant base be 12? Is there a plant that has [inaudible] in it, in large numbers?

Speaker 1:          02:40:12       Um, so b 12 is actually made a buy back certain strains of bacteria. And the reason to tie in me is because it gets me, you know, animals are predators and so it gets concentrated in their muscle, gets concentrated in, in animal tissue. But what about animals that are herbivores? I mean, is it still predators? Because they're, they're eating, they're eating a variety of, of things that have the, the bacteria, like there's certain strains of mushrooms that have it in order to, if you're a Vegan or vegetarian, you're just eating those mushrooms. You'd have to eat an enormous amount to get the RDA, but it's more concentrated in animal meat which are constantly eating it. So it gets concentrated in their tissues because they are b. 12 is required as a cofactor for a lot of enzymes in multiple organs, including their muscles. So their muscles, you know, every time they're eating, whatever has the be 12 on it, they're concentrating it.

Speaker 1:          02:41:04       So there are certain types of bacteria that make be 12, but I don't think vegans or vegetarians can just get it from that. They have to eat a lot of it, like, like one of those crazy. So the argument that have Vegan can get enough v12 from just a standard Vegan diet without supplementing. You don't buy that? No, I don't. So there's, there was a study that was done in Tanzania, so there's a few researchers. Ucla actually is where I think one of them just retired, but there's some researchers at Ucla that we're studying the effects of b 12 and iron deficiency on cognition, on, you know, learning cognition behavior. And there was a bunch of studies that were associative studies like that crappy premature ejaculation, obesity where it's like, you know, these two things are associated but we don't know if it's causing. And so there was an association with low B, Twelve low iron and poor Iq, lower Iq, poor cognition, poor behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:42:09       But there was no real causal, you know, roll identified. And so these, there's a couple of researchers at ucla that did two different clinical trials where, um, there was 12 different schools in Tanzania that were selected and these clinical trials lasted two years and there was two of them. The first trial was 575 kids are around 600 and the other one was like 370 something so closer to 400. So total we're talking a total of about a thousand children. School children, like these were elementary school children. And the typical thing they eat in Tanzania is, um, it's like a porridge, I forgot the name of it, but it's a porridge and it has vegetables, it has beans and it has corn and that's their standard porch. And so what the trial was designed with the school kids, we're going to give it. They were given a snack every single day for two years, either the porridge or they got the porch with a glass of milk or they got the porridge with meat.

Speaker 1:          02:43:04       And every three to six months there were arithmetic and reading tests done. So they were looking, trying to measure cognitive performance. And there was, um, they measured physical performance and muscle mass. Um, and, and what the results were of this study was that the porridge with the meat. So the school children that were eating the meat with the porridge scored better on math, arithmetic. They scored better on reading tests. They had larger, they have more muscle mass and they grew more than the other school children that did not get the meat. And they also. So that's all quantitative. Um, they also, they were more likely to exhibit leadership qualities out in the playground. That's a little more subjective, subjective, but still interesting. So the bottom line here is that, you know, obviously in Tanzania they're not, they're not supplementing or not, you know, taking b, 12 iron and they're also, there's also essential amino acids that are present neat, which our bodies can't make, which are found in some.

Speaker 1:          02:44:04       You can find some plant sources of it, like keen water or hempseed has it, but they're not supplementing with that stuff over in Tanzania. So if you don't have access to those things and you're just eating vegetables and beans and corn, then you will have nutritional deficiencies. Now the question is, if those children were given a, b, 12 supplement or iron, would that have made a difference? Probably, it probably would have. I mean, there's been studies in the United States that have been done on school children that have been deficient in certain micronutrients and they were given a multivitamin and an Omega three supplement, fish oil and they only the ones that were deficient to begin with improved, like did better on reading and arithmetic test. So there's definitely an argument to be made there. But I think, you know, I think for Vegetarians, um, you know, we live in a very different time.

Speaker 1:          02:44:50       Obviously there's, there's protein powders and keenwah on hemp seed and be 12 sublingual. And what are they getting [inaudible] from? If it's a Vegan based, I don't. Oh, is that like, I think possible. I thought it was just like methyl cobalamin. So I don't, I don't think that there's, it's not me, it's just, it's just synthetic be 12. How would they synthesizing it? I don't know. You're going beyond my knowledge base, but so there it is possible to get both iron and b 12 from. So, so b, 12 is, I mean, not a lot of vegetarians supplement with b 12. I mean they know and sublinguals important because there's also gene polymorphisms that affect the way your gut absorbs be 12. So people have to, uh, to bypass that. You can put it onto your soul sublinguals the optimal way to take it. Yeah. I think for anyone, if someone's a Vegan, what are the, what are the supplements that they should take?

Speaker 1:          02:45:46       You think b12 iron wood. Okay. Well with the iron is kind of tricky. I just want to mention, because you know, iron, a lot of vegans think that they can get their iron from their diet because iron is also found in beans. It's, it's in plants, it's in Spanish, but the way it's bound, it's bound in something called phytate, which we cannot digest. And so the bioavailability of iron is one point eight times less in plant form than in meet me. It's bound to something called Heme, which gives, it gives blood cells that are red color, which is why red meat has more of it, but um, people that are, uh, that are vegetarian that think they're getting enough iron, I really think they should get their levels measured. So women lose a lot of iron during menstruation. So the, so the RDA for iron for men is eight milligrams a day for women.

Speaker 1:          02:46:35       It's 18 went, so already on top of that, if you're a vegetarian or Vegan, multiplying by one point eight is already important if you're just getting it from food because the bioavailability of iron is almost two fold less than from me. So that's one thing to consider. And, and the other thing is also an athletes. So when you're like an endurance athlete, you actually, a hemo lysis occurs. Red Blood cells lice when you're doing like very intense endurance training and so you lose iron there too because you'll lose losing red blood cells. Iron is tricky because you don't want too much of it. It's like if you're supplementing like it's not. There's no guesswork here. There's no guesswork with iron. Having so having too much, when you take too much free, like supplemental iron, it can cause, you know, free iron inside yourselves and that is like dynamite.

Speaker 1:          02:47:24       That's like, like it reacts with enzymes in your body and it screws up energy production. It causes lots of damage. So it's really, really bad, really bad to get to my drug. This is supplemental iron from actual sources. Notes tightly regulated, but when you start to do supplemental iron, yeah. So I think that, um, and then there's Jane Pauley, some people like Dan has one, I, I've, I've seen lots of people's DNA where they have a, there's a variation in a gene that can lead to too much iron overload. Um, it's called hematic, Chroma, hemochromatosis, and, and it's very, it is very common. And if you, if you're, if you have one of those jeans and you're taking supplemental iron, you have even more free irons. It's very bad, very bad. So I think that people should definitely, I don't know what all the blood levels, there's different markers that you can measure, your physician will know, but getting iron levels measured is important.

Speaker 1:          02:48:17       If you're gonna start supplementing and when you do supplement with Arne, is it important to take it with food, with, uh, with fats like what is, what is the absorption? Vitamin C, Vitamin C, I'm dramatically increases the absorption of non heme iron. So hire an iron that's not found in meat. So even actually people vegetarians that are eating a bunch of beans, legumes, um, first of all they needed to get one one point eight times more than they would have meat, but they also, if they eat it with a citrus fruit or have some berries or Broccoli's high in vitamin C habit with your beans, that would, that would make a, make a difference in increasing the bioavailability of iron. So that would be important. That's a fascinating aspect of food supplementary or supplementation is eating it with the right foods and making sure that, you know, some things you don't want to eat with any food at all and some things you want to have on a full stomach or you want fat.

Speaker 1:          02:49:11       The fat soluble vitamins, carotinoids, even vitamin D. um, the, the vitamins that are soluble in fat are the bioavailability is increased when you take it with fat. And so that would be another one actually a lot of vegetarians probably think they're getting enough vitamin a because Beta carotene, which is in plants, can be converted into vitamin A. Vitamin a gets is actually, um, it actually becomes a hormone and it works much like Vitamin d not quite the same, but it does change, it activates genes, turns genes off, does all this stuff. So it's very important for immune function, for your eye, for vision, but there are, um, you have to, the bioavailability of Beta carotene is very low. We don't absorb it very well. That increases that bioavailability. So taken with that because they are fat soluble, the carotenoids, Beta carotenes, fat soluble, and also, um, there are gene polymorphisms that people have so they don't convert Beta carotene into vitamin a very well.

Speaker 1:          02:50:09       Like my brother in law has one where he doesn't at all very well. So he has to actually get vitamin a from an animal source or you can get retinal acetate. I don't know, I think it's synthetic, but that's something that some vegetarians may consider, not, not all of them, but some just considering whether or not they have that gene polymorphism. I think the main ones are iron B, 12, Omega three and vitamin D there, you know, 70 percent of the population doesn't get enough vitamin D, but vegetarians often think they're getting enough vitamin D because you make it from the sun. But you know, the problem is, is that so many factors regulate that because a uvb radiation has to hit your skin to make it. And so if your wearing sunscreen or you have um, a lot of melanin, so if you're, you've got like dark pigmentation that blocks it out latitude where you live.

Speaker 1:          02:50:58       So uvb rays, like don't hit the atmosphere certain times of the year in certain regions. So you know, you're only three or four months out of the year can make Vitamin d from the sun and then age, you know, as you get older, a 70 year old makes only 25 percent of the vitamin D that they made when they were 20 years old. Wow. Yeah. So all these factors play a role and there is a vitamin. I know I was talking to Rachel about this because vitamin D supplements d three, the plant form is [inaudible]. It's made by mushrooms. Mushrooms also make vitamin D when they're exposed to sun. The plant form doesn't get converted into the hormone very well. And also there's been two recent studies that have shown that [inaudible] may actually inhibit a [inaudible] function and muscle. So it actually has negative effects in muscle tissue. Taking too much do too.

Speaker 1:          02:51:47       Yeah. So [inaudible] is the, is the best supplement form and most of the [inaudible] on the markets from lanolin which is secreted from sheep skin or something. I don't know. I don't think that's Vegan friendly. But there is. There is a type of algae Lichen Lichen that that's a, that makes vitamin D and lincolns and algae. I don't know what it is. White plant. Is it weird funky stuff that grows fungus? Alaska? Yeah. It's like a moss almost. Let me pull that up. Liking. Yeah. So it's something that, uh, I know Caribou eat a lot of black tail deer, so it's like a white, tasteless sort of a grass that they exist or not a grasp, like a, almost like a, it's weird. It's weird plant here. That's what it looks like. What does that, that was kind of weird looking. It's weird stuff. Yeah. You find it all over the place on Prince Edward Island in Alaska was the first place I came in contact with it and I was like, what is this?

Speaker 1:          02:52:49       And then we'll this black tail deer eat a lot of, some kind of a plant so you can get three from that because the company that makes teeth. So there are vegan friendly sources of it. So if, if they do want to eat Vegan, it is possible to get a fully balanced diet and protein would be the other way. The other thing, right? The essential amino acids are typically found in animal protein. So getting, um, so those are like leucine, leucine, Tryptophan, penal, Alanine, I don't know, there's nine of them, but just exist some really low doses. And in most plant based proteins, is that what the problem is? I know the very, very, very low doses, but you can get some that have higher doses. It's hemp seed and then chemo. So those are the only two now I'm sure there's more than enough.

Speaker 1:          02:53:41       Right? But they have like really a full amino acid profile and they have the essential ones that you need. And keep in mind the essential proteins. That's what's the branch chain amino acids. That's what that actually taken up into muscle cells. So. And there's been studies that have been done just getting, doing plant protein without the essential amino acids. Does not do not. You can't gain muscle mass after doing strength training like you can if you take in the essential amino acids because that's. You need those to be taken up into muscle to build proteins. Well there's some of the weird Vegan arguments that they repeat almost as if it's fact, but that's not. And one of them was that saturated fats and saturated fats are somehow or another bad for you. Yeah. So that's a very confusing literature. I think I'm saturated fats in and of themselves aren't necessarily bad unless you have.

Speaker 1:          02:54:39       There are certain gene polymorphisms in um, so PPR, Alpha, Ppr, Gamma fto genes, if you have a gene polymorphism in one of these three genes because in order to, um, when you eat diet, saturated fat and it needs to be metabolized, transported to the right place, you know, you don't want it just sitting around in a, as fatty acids in bloodstream. Will. Those jeans that I just mentioned, they play a role in doing that. Some people don't activate them very well, and so if they have a high saturated fat and a low poly or mono unsaturated fat intake, they can actually have increased type two diabetes. They can have poor glucose response because fatty acids are sitting around in their bloodstream and antagonizing the insulin receptor I'm doing, doing all sorts of things, but if they have a higher polyunsaturated fat, which is found in fish or nuts or mono unsaturated fat, so abakada autos, nuts, olive oil.

Speaker 1:          02:55:36       If they have a higher ratio of those, then it activates those genes more and so they don't actually have those negative effects, so that's one thing. That's the smaller thing. The real problem with saturated fat is actually sugar. Yeah. The, the. There's. The problem is is that saturated fat increases the production of ldl cholesterol, which isn't necessarily bad unless you have massive inflammation from eating refined carbohydrates and specifically from eating sucrose or fructose corn syrup, and this has been shown actually a colleague of mine, Ron Kraus, he's a brilliant cardio cardiologist and he's actually one of the guys that he discovered a a test to measure what really the bad part of cholesterol, which isn't just ldl. It's actually a small dense particle and that small dense particles formed only when you have have the saturated fat plus the high fructose corn syrup or the refined sugar because it's causing inflammation.

Speaker 1:          02:56:36       So I did a podcast with him. It's a little technical, but like my mother in law, she, she, she watched the video and she had done a liquid panel where the her physician had measured her ldl particle, measuring particle size, measured triglycerides, all of these things wanting to get her on stands because she had really high cholesterol. It turns out I knew why she had high cholesterol. She has high cholesterol because she has gene polymorphism in April. We for which prevents cholesterol from being recycled, so it's not. That's why she has high cholesterol, so she watched this video and she like learned all about the particle size and that it's the small dense ones that are really an indicator of cardiovascular disease and her small dense were like, she had none. It was all the good kind of all the ldl cholesterol is important because anytime you make a new cell, you need cholesterol.

Speaker 1:          02:57:23       Cholesterol is made of cell membranes. Every time you're making a new kidney, your liver cell, you need cholesterol. When you have damage, when you hit yourself or you're doing your workout and your muscles get a little damaged, you need cholesterol there to build, to repair that damage so you need it. If you don't have it, you're in trouble. But anyways, the point is is that the saturated fat can. That's why there's so much confusion is because one gene polymorphisms to people are now starting to tease apart that it's actually the combination of eating refined carbohydrates and saturated fat. If you just have the saturated fat you don't have and you're eating vegetables and good things as well, then you're not going to have all that inflammation. You're not going to make small dense ldl particles, which I talked about this with you last time. That's what makes the small dense ldls inflammation.

Speaker 1:          02:58:07       So when you have the small dense, because a certain protein gets obscured, it causes it to like stick to the, um, to the walls of your blood vessels very easy. So that's kind of the danger because then you start to accumulate a plaque there. So there's totally makes sense when you talk about the amount of heart disease that exists in people that have this typical American diet which is high in saturated fat, but also high in high fructose corn syrup process. Sugars in vegetables. Yeah. I mean, here's the thing. This is the problem with all those studies, those studies that are correlations is that you're looking at people that are eating. Yes, they're eating meat, yes, they're eating saturated fat, but they're also not eating vegetables. They're also eating cake and crackers and chips and hamburger bonds and you know, all that stuff and her lifestyle, sedentary lifestyle, all those things.

Speaker 1:          02:58:57       So you know that these studies like you have to really take it with a grain of salt and especially for healthy omnivores, you know, like I said, there are vegetarians that are unhealthy. They eat a bunch of process. There's also very healthy vegetarians and vegans out there. Well, there's a lot of unhealthy omnivores. I mean if you were to go to like the DMV where like someplace to everyone has to go and like take a survey. How many of them eat me? Will it probably like 95 percent of them are going to eat meat and then you ask them like what's their vegetable intake? You know, what's your refining? How many refined carbohydrates do you take in how many, you know, they're all going to be not eating vegetables and they're going to be eating their cake and chips and you know, there's their, their hot dog buns and sort of blame it all on these.

Speaker 1:          02:59:43       The blame it all on saturated fats is wrong. It is. You know, some people can have a problem with saturate when they have too high of a saturated fat intake, even if they're eating healthy. Other healthy stuff, like I said, because the gene that that's activated that helps metabolize the fat, break it up, transports it to where it goes isn't getting turned on. Well, we'll get those genes get turned on by polyunsaturated fatty acids. And so if you eat a ratio, if you're eating saturated fat, which is dairy, you know some pork, I don't know, red meat mostly. Like if you get a lean cut, it's not even actually that high in saturated fat compared to dairy or cheese or butter. So much misinformation, so many people spout out this misinformation as fact too. It's just. It's so frustrating. It is frustrating. The other thing is that people actually will notice there's a problem in there.

Speaker 1:          03:00:36       If they're eating a lot of saturated fat and they have one of these polymorphisms, they start to gain weight. They start to have bad lipid profile. They start to end. They're like, they know like what I've been doing this I measured, I know it's bad. Well, they don't realize it's possibly because they have one of those gene polymorphisms. If they increase their, their poly unsaturated mono and saturated fat may actually not be a problem, but in cholesterol in and of itself is not a bad thing. It's not no cholesterol. You need cholesterol. You need it. You need it. Like I said, your own body's production of it, but you also need to take some in. Yes, exactly. Well, taking in dietary cholesterol doesn't even raise your body's cholesterol. Saturated fat will raise your body's cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol from eggs doesn't like. It's like nothing. It doesn't do anything wrong.

Speaker 1:          03:01:20       Michael Shermer bond crash showed that, so yeah. No, it was taking in dietary cholesterol doesn't even like move the dial for your. Your body's cholesterol production. It's so funny because so many people think it does. You know what really moves it? Stress stress dramatically increases cholesterol production. You know why? Because when you're stressed, your body makes your stress. Your body starts to make cholesterol and LDL lipoproteins which have cholesterol in them because it stops up. It stops up what's called endotoxin, which is released when you're stressed or inflamed and you want your. You want to stop it up because it can cause lots of damage. So you start to make cholesterol and what ends up happening is when you're inflamed, your body will turn off the production. It basically starts making something called [inaudible], which is important to make these. You know, these are very low dense particle ally proteins I was talking about, but what it also does is it inhibits your body from being able to metabolize fat with the exception of medium chain triglycerides because it inhibits the transporter.

Speaker 1:          03:02:25       This transporter on Mitochondria called cpt. That is inhibited when your body's inflamed because it's making that Melano Kobe and when that transporter is inhibited, your polyunsaturated, you're saturated all like 99 percent of the dietary fat you take in is not getting used, so it gets stored or it starts. It's like you have fatty acids into your bloodstream and can raise triglycerides and things so it can be really bad, but MCTs bypass that. Mcts don't need that transporter. We just blew through three hours again. That's awesome. Lou, through it feels like it was 20 minutes. It's crazy. It's really crazy.

Speaker 3:          03:03:02       Yeah. These are ridiculous conversations. Thank you very much. You're awesome. Thanks Joe. As always, I'm going to have to go over this 50 times with a notebook to try to get half of it. Found my fitness.com, found my fitness on twitter. What else? Yeah, the genetic tool. I've got people can check that out, found my fitness.com forward slash genetics, and then I've got a podcast on itunes, did the cryotherapy. I talk all about that. I've got some. How do they get to that? What is it on itunes? What's it called? Found my fitness. Good. Sticking with one brand. Yeah. Thank you so much. You're awesome. Can't say enough things. So those are the best conversations. I look forward to them and I'm really, really appreciative that you do these. Thank you so much. Bye everybody.

Speaker 4:          03:03:52       Yes.
