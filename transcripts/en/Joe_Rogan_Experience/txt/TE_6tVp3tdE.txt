Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. But I look at that the same way I kind of look at music or the same way I look at writing or comedy or anything. So it's fascinating to me watching someone go after something and, and, and put it together and make something that is almost unfathomable take place, whether it's a creation of an album, whether it's a, you know, a comedy special, whether it's a, someone writes an amazing book. I love when people get shit done. Yeah. I do too. It's a beautiful thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well, as artists, right? Like, does that, like, as, as an artist, does that inspire you when you see, like if you go to see a great movie or read a great book or something like that, does that inspire you to want to create? Yeah. It doesn't inspire me to create a write a book.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Right, right, right. But, um, I think I kind of know what my lane is at this point. Yeah. You know, I try and stay in it. Yeah. Um, but yeah, I mean definitely go see a movie or, or, or read, uh, you know, and, and it, it'll get my creative juices flowing and you know, inspire me to be, to just be better and try and contribute, you know what I mean? Contributes something good or be positive and make, make myself feel something to make somebody else feel something. I Dunno. It, it does something to me. Definitely. It's hard to describe. I was still can't describe what it is that makes this creative thing, um, click or explain how I do what I do. But definitely seeing movies or hearing you know, here and um, you know, great musicians, great guitar players, you know, the freak me out.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Oh Shit, don't get too involved a little bit. You know what I mean? And I'm like, well, no hunger. Yeah. Though. It's like, okay, I respect that. Let me go get you hit on my game. And yeah, this guy was born in the 60s you know what I mean? Exactly what we're here to take over yogas, thousands of years old, the balls, the balls on this guy, literally all tucked away. And that little grape smuggler any worse. There was a guy in my class that used to go there for a while. He used to wear the crepe smuggler. He was very sot nom. He was very [inaudible] know, hit a man bun to smugglers and a man bun. I want to beat you up in the parking lot. Oh, totally. Totally. And I think the other women look at you over there and your Nike workout stuff and they're like, all right, he's, he's fine.

Speaker 1:          02:39          They think so. Yeah. They're like, thank you for not doing that. I hope so. I hope so. I don't know. The place I go to is very nice, very nice people. But again, it's not like the hot young hard, but I'm probably the best looking girl in the class a road. It was a joke. I couldn't help it. That's not true either. Some cute ones, but the point being is that's not what it is. It's a, you know, but there is a sexual vibe there. D I mean, you're just there to do yoga, but yet there is that kind of thing and which is why I'm not too big a fan of the classes. The team you up where they want you to partner up for this thing. Yeah. You ever have that? No. Oh, like you stretch you out. Yeah. They're like, I get a partner.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Get unhappy baby with your legs behind with your partner pushed down on you and you're like, you know, you're fired on this lady. Don't what happens. That'd be actually the smart board as a married man. That would be the smart man. How much porn takes place in the Yoga Student Yoga Studio where the yoga that teacher says, um, I would like to review some poses with you after class. I'll give you some tips. That'd be like, if you were, let's, let's just be as politically correct about this possible. If you were single and the person actually was into you and this all went down according to this, this, that would be the greatest like fantasy ever. Like you're in that hot yoga class, all hot and Sweaty, and afterwards the teacher wants to fuck God. Damn. She's like, Tom, I just really feel like your practice could aid with just a little private one on one instruction. Yes, sure, sure. The first, we're going to start with a foot massage. Um, okay. Slide on your back. Um, all right. Oh, okay. And she's rubbing your feet and lifting your legs. I'm just going to stretch your legs out and she's rubbing the inside of your thighs and you start moaning. She moans back and the next thing you know, it's on Tom Papa. Oh, I'm gonna stay

Speaker 2:          04:40          [inaudible]. Okay.
