It's a very controversial, if you're a man, you go pick flowers and you live by yourself, you're suspect. You'd definitely see you're going to fold under pressure. You know, guys think like that. Sure, but why? Because they're idiots. Flowers are fucking fantastic. They're beautiful. They're some of the most amazing creations that nature has to offer. What I love about something like flowers.com or any florist, I love when you have flowers that are in the section of the grocery store that represents to me like a masterpiece of nature. You know the and the fact that you can get them delivered. This is the most ridiculous thing ever. It's incredible. Flowers are fantastic. I wish we should all be surrounded with flowers were just scared. We don't want to be soft.

Speaker 2:          00:01:12       Yeah, and you never feel weird about like if you go to like a museum or some hotel or some really rich person's house that has like garden, like well cared for, you know what I mean? They have a staff that does their garden, those flat, everybody stands in Awe, right? Of like this. It's nature's color Palette running through their yard and there's crazy flowers everywhere and no one feels weird about that.

I was walking through, I saw, I was like, I can take a picture of these fucking beautiful flowers. Maybe we can change people's perception. Maybe people would be nicer if they have flowers in their home. Is that possible? I think so. You can also get one that you can download the mobile app and you can order it. Um, you can order flowers from that which is pretty bad ass. So like on the fly on the, on the trolley as it were, uh, click on the microphone in the upper right hand corner and enter my code, which is j r.

What's wrong with the order and that just that, that is something sweet. Just a little something to make. Make Nice, make Nice, nice everywhere. Big Flower advocate guys, the flower advocate. We're also brought to you by ting.com a tang is one of my favorite companies that we use here on, uh, on the podcast. And one of the reasons being is I like when a company does something like this, they just gave you a no bullshit cell phone option.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Sweet. Chris Ryan who was on a podcast all the time, the author of sex at dawn, he loves him. He just started using it and saving them money and it works. They use sprint a sprint's great. You could, it was everywhere. You can get Internet on it and can do everything he can on a regular cell phone, but you don't have to have a contract. You can cancel anytime you want. You don't have to worry about all the bull shit that you usually get when you're dealing with cell phones. It can be a gigantic fucking pain in the ass. They offer top of the line android devices, which is what I use now. I told you that's how he buns. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy note. Look at this screen. I got off the apple tit. My friend has it feel it feels good to be free of the tit. I thought about using a windows laptop, but then I woke up.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       I really did think about it is you can ask him. That's a beautiful, what's a good windows laptop? I like changing things up and even if it's for no fucking reason, I don't know why, but I do. I like changing things up. Do you, do you miss any of the familiarity of the APPS, ms? A few APPS, but only a couple of them like getting on Twitter. No problem. Shizam no problem. There's just a few of them that you miss. Just download or an awesome I have today, but the Instagram one sucks of fat one. If you're out there Instagram coders, how dare you? How dare you try to pass this clunky android version of a simple and elegant iPhone APP. Get it to get the bitches can't be that hard, but if you want to get a bad ass cell phone sim, Tim has mall, they have the note three.

Speaker 1:          00:06:33       They have the galaxy s four which I probably should have got, which is probably the right size. I think the galaxy phone and the HTC one which is also very, very dope. I think that's the right size. I think that's a little too big. I think I'm being silly. I think with that is, is like I'm on the rebound from apple. I'm like fuck you. So I dated like this, like really blonde guy and I went right to a fucking African, just dark as shit. And now I'm like, I don't know if this is going to work out. I missed some of the characteristics of the blonde guy, you know, miss the lack of bruising, you know, so that's what you're like, I feel it. I'm on the rebound. Yeah. If I was a girl, that's my analogy. That's a big one right there. Rebounded with a big boy.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       Yeah. Just fucking tired of your bullshit. Um, ting is, um, one of the nice things about Ting also is you can uh, bring over phones if you have them on sprint. If you have a nexus five on sprint, um, you just, you can order a sprint Sim card from them in order to, uh, bring your coverage or your device over to ting. So just go to the bottom of the devices page. And tink doesn't sell the nexus five, but you can purchase one from the Google play store and easily, uh, bring it over to ting. Um, the best thing about it is you don't like if you want to cancel, like if your, if your cell phone doesn't work in your house and sometimes you don't know until you get one and then you're like, what the fuck? You know, at t and t works here, but you know that Verizon doesn't or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       That's annoying. Um, if you can't get cell phone service at work or at school or wherever the fuck you're going, you're probably gonna want to switch companies. What have you tried to do that with a big company? You're fucking doomed. 300 pay out the ass. It's because you're not really buying the phone in total. You're buying part of it and you sort of financing the rest and they apply that to your bill. That's why you pay one price for one a phone. If you know, when you sign up for x amount of years, you know, it's kind of slippery. It's kind of a slippery thing. Um, I think it's way better to do it this way. You own your phone done and they have the best phones. I mean, it's all like once I'm like, I'm totally done with the idea of, uh, being stuck with one company. One thing that I, that I don't like about the apple thing too. I don't like getting everything from them. I don't like that either. I don't like that. I can't download stuff like he can't save and files

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       and stuff like that. With this thing, you can save files. Like I could save pdf files. It's an apple restrictive to a flash too, right? Don't they have that big apple doesn't do flash. Yeah. Yeah. But this thing does everything. You know, I that I think, I mean apples, I think the iPhone is a pretty fucking amazing. Oh, and if you have an iPhone four or four s you could bring it over to the tank too. I phones are pretty fucking amazing. They're incredibly well designed. But the difference to them and the android phones, man, it's really subtle now. It used to be pretty obvious, but now it's pretty, God damn subtle. It's a, it's pretty fucking close and the distance between the d, The difference rather between the experience you get with the larger screen, that's a big difference. The difference between the quality of them is a small difference.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       I mean crazy can't deny apples build quality. It's amazing. They make amazing phones, but the differences in the experience of having a screen that's six inches versus, or 5.7 inches as opposed to having a screen it's for, there's a big difference that that phone sucks up fat Dick, if you're trying to watch a movie. Yes, this is, you can actually watch videos clearly and it looks cool. Anyway, Ting bitches, Tei and g, go to rogan.ting.co.com and save yourself $25 off the um, off of your first ting device when you sign up. So rogan.ting.com and save 25 bucks off your first ting device. It's an excellent, excellent cell phone company. The way they work, you purchase your phone, get it from Ting, you receive it in two to five business days. Then you activate your device with Ting. You have the option to select a new phone number or port an existing one and tangled, break your rates up by minutes, text messages and megabytes and bill you at the end of the month for what you've used.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       Why am I pausing? I'm 98% of people saved money with Tang. They love it. So you'll love it too. Uh, we're also brought to you by on it, o. N n. I. T if you haven't been to on it for awhile. We have a lot of new shit including digestive tech enzymes, trying to get involved in as many things that optimize health as possible. And I'm sure along the way there's going to be some that I find not worth the effort and there's going to be some that I find, uh, they don't really seem to help. But, uh, I am a believer in digestive enzymes. Um, I think that you get enzymes from food, you know, and you can get enzymes from, I mean, from milk, like raw milk. It's one of the reasons why raw milk digests better than pasteurized and homogenized milk because it has the enzymes in it. It's like it's a normal thing to eat when you're eating milk and it's gone through pasteurization and what does it homogenization. Is that what it is? Cause that was your homogenization, whatever the word is, whatever the word is, where they boil the fuck out of it and kill everything that's alive. You're not supposed to eat it like that. Like when it goes into your system, your system's like, what is this fucking

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       dead shit? You just threw down the hole and then you start lifting your cheeks up and cut and horrible milk farts. Yeah. Dude, I was by myself last night and I had cookies in milk. I just laid some of the worst farts of my career. Yeah, that's nice. I didn't yet get any digestive enzymes. I fucked up Tommy Buns. Cookies and milk did it? Yeah. Cookies and milk are not good. Gluten free or whatever. Still Milk. I had Carnegie aside and eggs for breakfast with a Spanish rice and uh, all kinds of dead stuff out of me. It was hard to a dead stuff. He's seen the Godzilla trailer. Uh, no. You haven't seen it. Oh wait, no. Maybe I did. I was a new way. There's a new one that's just a new one. Oh, it makes me, I saw the other one paid. Merrick's Ma Monster Boehner.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Hard. Pretty good. Yeah. It looks pretty bad ass. There's all kinds of new monsters in here. Yeah. Speaking of monsters. Yeah, we have, we have Zombie kettle bells too. It's the newest thing we have. If you're like a big walking dead fan and you're like, you know what, man, I need to prepare for the invasion. I need to feel it in my bones. I'm trying to work it out with one hour of Zombie. Kettlebells awaits. What weights do you have? 72 pounds. 54 pounds, 36 pounds and 18 pounds. If you've never done it before, start with 18 trust me. You can get a really good workout with 18 and you're like, that's ridiculous. I'm a fucking savage man. I know you are. I know you aren't, dude. Trust me. Get the Keith Weber Extreme Kettlebell cardio DVD that they sell. There's one and two that they sell it on at.com and that cardio workout will fuck you up.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       I'm in pretty good shape and that thing fucks me up with 35 pounds. What is it credible? What's the workout? It's called the extreme kettle bell cardio workout. It's not like a bulk thing and you're not lifting like a lot of weight. Like I do the, I seriously do this exercise with 35 pounds, which is pretty light. You know, I can pick that up pretty easy. Um, but when you do it and you know, you get five minutes in and your lungs were on fire and your fucking legs are burning, you don't, you can't believe what kind of a workout you can get with just an 18 pound kettle bell. How long do you do that workout for? 40 minutes. Whoa. It's hard. It's intense. It's brutal. Yeah. My Heart's killing me at the end of it. Everything is killing me. My heart's pounding. I can't breathe.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       It's amazing that that's like that. You could do that with a 35 pound kettle bell. When I was young, when I just used to do like weightlifting stuff like bench press and shit like that. I used to think that 35 pounds for policy. So I wanted to get past that 35 pounds as quick as possible using the fifties now like that's what everybody does. They want to go to 15 hundreds. Yeah. Um, I think somewhere along the line you realize how much strength, I mean especially when it comes to athletic performance, how much strength you need and how much muscular endurance you need. Muscular endurance is a huge part of anything athletic and using dude doing 35 pounds. Yeah, you're going to develop strength, but you're really going to develop muscular endurance and you could build muscle on bodyweight exercises with a 35 pound kettle bell and you could have a fucking rocking sexy body. Tommy ponds were, I'm trying to do it. I took my first, uh, kickboxing Muay Thai guys yesterday. Oh, it's so good for you, man. Yeah, that's great. Especially if you go to what Jim?

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       Um, it's, uh, it's down in so I could stalk you. Yeah, I'll tell you later

Um, this, uh, Wednesday night where the Ice House, uh, it's me, Ian Edwards. I'm Tony Hinchcliffe. A full charge. Yeah, the full charge map, full Tron, uh, Lee camp. And I think that's it. That place is the best. Yeah. It's amazing. It's going to be fun. Uh, it's, it's one of the coolest places to perform in southern California. I would've gone, I got to have dinner with my cousin Brian. If you hate, if you get out of there and they'd go to bed early, they're going to be at your house

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       now. I'm going to be kind of east side of town. Maybe

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       fucking cart blanche Tom Bunch anytime you want. I appreciate that. And um, December 27th at the Mirage in Vegas, it's me, Joey Diaz, Ari Shaffir, and Brian Cowen trying to put the ground, the greatest show in the history of the universe. So Joey Diaz, Ari Shaffir, Brian Cowen and me, uh, all at the Mirage in Vegas. Can't fucking wait for that. We're going to have so much fun. Yeah. That's going to be, those people going to walk out of there. They're going to be bleeding from laughing. That's crazy. I spent the weekend with Joey. Oh, he's the greatest human being that's ever walked the face of the planet. Oh my gosh. Cue The music. We'll talk about your weekend experience.

Speaker 4:          00:16:31       Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast. Tom, what'd you guys go? You went with Joey somewhere? Yeah, and Joey and I,

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       uh, the Calusa casino in northern California and then went to hell. The point is that that's like, it's an hour from the Sacramento and then we did a Mcdonald theater and Eugene, Oregon on Saturday. Wow. Eugene, Oregon. Must've been fun. Yeah, they had snow like that. A snow storm the night before and all. We were like, yeah, it's fucking Oregon. Like they get snow. Big Deal. We got there and the like, we haven't had snow in four years. We were like, oh wow. Because they didn't plow any roads. None. So everything was just caked over iced over. That part of the real blinding. I thought it happened all the time there. Do you remember when they did that in New York City when it snowed and they didn't blame him? Plow? No, there was a big deal. It was a couple of years ago. It was a couple of years ago. There was a huge thing where they didn't budget correctly and they had a big snow storm and people were trying to get out there like where the fuck are the plows?

Speaker 2:          00:17:39       Yeah, it's funny, there's certain you can tell who's set up, who's used to snow because of, because solely because of the road. It's like when you're in Minneapolis and they'd be like, you know, eight inches fell last night. You're like, Ooh, I wonder how that'll let you step outside and you just see, you see black. Like they paved it immediately. You don't see any way there. They're just on top of that shit. And then you go like clearly when we were like, oh, you guys never get snow here because the road, and then I saw today people who are at the shows, I went to their Twitter and their like, roads are still shit. Like I haven't done anything for like three days. It was a,

Speaker 1:          00:18:17       a video of famous video from Oregon of these people sliding on this icy road. Really? Yeah. It's a famous video because I guess they're just notoriously shitty and allowing because it doesn't snow very, they didn't do a fucking thing. This video is ridiculous. It's like 10 minutes long of people just crashing into each other. Just standing there watching people come down this road and smash into each other.

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       Dude, the funny thing is they, the promoter called us a few hours before the show and she's like, man, we've been getting a lot of phone calls of people. Like I can't, I'm not, I can't drive in this. We're not gonna make it. She was like a lot, I don't know how many people are going to be at your show. I was like, well how many, you know, there's nothing we can do about that. Like okay. Right and then we get there and there's still like a great turnout. Everybody who came was a podcast list.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       This, Whoa, look how they're sliding all over the place. I mean that it's fucking ice. Yeah, I can't stop his car. Look, look. It's just going to slide in that car behind him. This is ridiculous. Is that important? Oh Shit. Boom. Nascar's sliding. They're all sliding. The whole thing is ice. That is fucking terrifying. Cause what to the right? That's water. Oh No. Yeah Dude. That shit is absolutely terrified. Sky Bridges are our real problem. Bridges for some reason, because they're not connected to the earth. That ground freezes super quick. So if you're in a place and it gets, it starts getting cold when you might be in an icy rain situation. Stay the fuck off of bridges, guys. Like you fucking, oh my God. Look at this thing, man. This is crazy. Look at this thing. Just sliding. What part of Oregon is this? It doesn't say I'm Maria.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Portland. Portland. Yeah, you bitches got to prepare for it. Okay. That's, this is preposterous. Portland, Oregon frozen rain is what it is. You could see on those, uh, like on that fence when you could see that, that shit that's sitting there that looks like snow and snow, but it's also a lot of frozen rain. It's like when it gets to be like 32, just 32 and it was just 33 and (333) 023-0430 two and you get that horrible fucking frozen rain. UHMM son Shit. Yeah. Fuck that noise. He's still going sideways. When I was a kid, when I was in high school, me and my friend John Jewitt, he was a, my sister's boyfriend. We were on the roof of the garage. Me and him just sitting there drinking beer, watching cars slide into each other on our street the best because people couldn't, I lived on a hill and a no one, you couldn't tell that it was a total black eyes. You couldn't tell. So people were driving like normal. Yeah. Then it would

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       just whew

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       across from a river and like when it would start to freeze, like I would get it, you know, and you're close to the water, you know, I guess maybe it's colder. I mean, if that makes any sense. But uh, the fucking entire street just was a giant hockey rink. So we called the cops and the cops came down the hill and the cops came down the hill just bang poem. But they came to investigate.

Speaker 2:          00:21:25       These guys don't know how to drive. That's the problem. Yeah. The whole thing was a hockey rink. So they got in and just bounced off the curves this in mass. Whew. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       Newton Newton. Upper falls. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       Yeah, it was, it was whore, dude. I gotta tell you Diaz, first of all, he got stopped in three different airports by like eight different people this weekend. Oh. By throngs of fans. You're saying fans, TSA at the airport and they want to check out her, his balls for weed. He, first of all, my God, that is his tolerance is it's under running. Dude, I took a quarter of a bite of an edible. You're brave quarter. Yeah, I mean the very end of it and 30 minutes later I was just out of my mind. I mean, my eyes weren't even open and I could tell people were looking at me like they were like, yeah, I mean you're, you're like, oh, I'm not hiding this. This is bad. And he ate of that. He ate an entire one like that. And then he's like saying ridiculous Shit Shit that I, I feel like I get arrested for thinking it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:39       Like I don't, I can't play it back in my head. I was like, dude, shut the fuck. Is he saying I cannot, I really can't say the main thing that he was, I can't, hey, it would be, it would be, it was not okay to say [inaudible] have to do with ethnic groups, racial things. This one in particular is so awful. Like I came to spin it. I can't spend a joke, you know, I have, and this is one of the things that I've been on about lately. I have a real problem when people get upset at people that say shit that they don't really mean, but that's awful, but hilarious. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Because like look how hard we're laughing. No, yeah, I get the picture. You guys. Yeah. I don't even know what he said. I don't even know what he said to you.

Speaker 2:          00:23:29       And I'm already laughing. Just crazy thinking about all the shit he said to me in the path. Of course. Of course. Well, he, he's going off about this thing. I'm standing there, I look like I'm gonna puke because I'm laughing so hard because this is in the airport and he's around people. He has no give a fuck, fuck blah, blah, blah. Shut up dude. He doesn't give a fuck. And I've, I have tears. People looking at my, and then he's like Tsa and uh, this guy, I look in, the uniform looks over and he's like, you got to look at this guy. I'm like, dude, I'm all fucked up. Like don't bring attention to me right now. And then that guy, he's like, Hey Joe Diaz, I'm a big fan. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me right now? I turn around and walk away. I was like, I'm leaving.

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       It's too high for this. I walked away, I leave him, I'm like, I don't want any part of the shit. And I go, I buy a magazine that I leave at the counter. That's how high. I'm like, I want to get this magazine. And then I walk away from it and I remember like 30 minutes later before we board and I go back and it's sitting there and I go, that's my magazine ladies. Like, okay. And I go, I paid for it already. And she was like, okay, like go ahead and take that if you went so out of my mind. But then, then we walked by, we go and a guy, a fucking pilot comes by, you know when they have like, they're always have the double look luggage thing right there. One bag on top of the other, the pilot bag. He fucking walks by us and he's like, Hey Joey Diaz. And I'm like, are you serious right now? And he's like, it's my airport. Everybody calls me to say what I'm like, really? My airport and then Oregon, this was in Burbank, Burbank airport.

Speaker 2:          00:25:05       We then get stopped in, we land in Sacramento and people stop them for pictures. Then the baggage handler, uh, stops him. Asked him like 100 weeks. I hate these fucking questions guys. Ask Way too many questions. No. Okay. So we, we leave there. Well he's super high. Can't off just having conversations with people. Then a family stops him. A lady with kids stops him for a picture. They all take a picture together. Like it was nonstop. The best was that, oh, this is the best part. So I take the quarter bite right and I'm completely fucking out of my mind. He eats an entire one. We sit down on the plane and he starts talking to me. I'm like, shut up man. Shut the fuck up. I cannot listen to you right now cause I'm like shaking. I'm like, I told him to shut up. Cause you're laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:25:53       Yes, yes. I'm like, I can't hear you talk. Shut up. And he's like, he's like, he like looks around. He's like, anyways. And he opens up a second one, eats the sec and of the thing I have a quarter bite of, so he's on eight doses of I'm and I'm like, Jesus Christ. So we go through this flight and every time he looks at me, like I said, he goes, oh. And I'm like, dude, shut the dog and story. No dunking a cookie. And then he calls him an hour and a half later. It goes, welcome to my world mother Fucker, Dude. Ow, ow, ow. We land, we land and I, and um, as we're landing, I was like, man, I go, dude, I was, I was pretty fucked up man. And he goes, and I look at him because all I'm thinking is like, I can't believe how much more advanced you are. The me, you know, it's like, like, I cannot believe what you mean tolerance wise. It's like, it's like, I can't believe I ran a mile and you just ran 40 miles, like as crazy as me and we both finished at the same time and then I go. So I'm amazed that he's not affected. I go, I can't believe how much that fucking me. He goes, I almost had three panic attacks on that flight.

Speaker 5:          00:27:13       I was like, yes. It made me so happy that he was awesome,

Speaker 2:          00:27:18       so fucked up. And He, I was like, Carrie still goes right back, right back in. I go, I go, I'm glad it's starting to wear off. He goes, not for me. I'm fucking

Speaker 5:          00:27:26       upright.

Speaker 6:          00:27:30       Yeah. His idea of going deep is so much deeper than your idea. He's breaking world records on a daily basis all the time. He's at the bottom of the Marianas trench with a shovel and he's like, there's got to be a deepest spot. This is bullshit. And the first thing he did as we get off that was like, let's smoke this joint.

Speaker 5:          00:27:47       I was like, are you talking about, what are you talking about man? We're not smoking a joint. I can take a break. And he's a maniac.

Speaker 6:          00:27:55       He's a brainiac. Yeah. Well he just goes through the whole day like that. And that's where, you know, people would step in and say, well, that boy's got a problem. Yeah. I'll tell you what he got. But he doesn't, he gets for a comedian. Yeah. It might be the best way to live life. Yeah. Scared on a regular basis and in betweens. Laughing your dick off. Scared, laughing your dick off. Scared, laughing you dick off. Yeah. He, um, uh, he's, the funny thing is like, even his

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       regular cadence, it's so is out of the norm for other people that you see people react to them. It's more fun to even watch people like at the restaurant next to us react to him than it is almost to watch him. Like he's talking and I see them like, they're like, Jesus. Like this is like a fucking, it's like you brought in a pit bull to have lunch here. You know what I mean? They've never seen somebody so intense and animate and saying these crazy things. It's like you watch them react to Joey.

Speaker 6:          00:28:54       Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean, man. He's just, it's just a, they don't come along that often. No, he's a, it's a rare thing that's a there. They're like, well, who's this guy? Yeah. You know, like you know guys and you go, oh I get it. That guy's like a little bit of this guy. A little bit of that guy's combination of

Speaker 2:          00:29:11       Joey's just like, what is that? Where'd that come from? You want to kill somebody? You invite him over for dinner. What?

Speaker 6:          00:29:20       Oh is his logic, how to get crimes committed correctly. And then my favorite thing is they'll say something and go, you know what the fuck I'm saying is I need to just walks away. I can end on a strong point. You want to kill somebody, you invite him over for dinner. Boom. He walks away. Great sense of timing. Yeah. Amazing. It's, it's a standup timing that he uses like in everyday real life. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       It's like never doing an act. Yeah. Cause his act, his, his life and his life is his act. Yeah. The way he talks his, his act. Totally. That's like the best you could ever hope for. The best you could ever hope for is like a merging of you and your ability to be you offstage and onstage. Yeah. I mean, I mean look at like who everybody or a lot of people that say it was like, you know, total master comedian basically talks in his voice like Chapelle walks up and he's like tells you about his day. Yeah. And that's kind of like the highest form, right, of being a comment. Cause you're like, I'm just going to, this isn't even a thing. I'm just talking to you. Yeah. And like Diaz is like a version of that where like he's just being Diaz. Yeah, just being Diaz.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       But he also works out, it works really hard. He writes, he does a lot of sets. Joey does a lot of sets. He'll go up like four or five times a week in town in weird places. So yeah. Travel to Oxnard and shit and do a set somewhere. He does a lot of like weird sets. He does. He gets up a lot. He was killing it man. Killing him. I'm sure he was. Man. What is a Eugene, Oregon like besides hippie and they don't know how to plow. We, we got to see so little of it because of the weather. Like it was, it was for Real Hotel Gig hotel. There was no checking anything out. Right. But the people were awesome. I mean, I couldn't believe how fun that was. The most fun. That was the funniest show. I've had like top three show the year. Why Fun.

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       And it was because of that, whether the only people that showed up were podcast listeners. So they listened to Joey's podcasts to listen to mine and they were just all fans. So it was like, it was such a, it was like doing a, you know, I was like a special event kind of show. These audiences are so different now. Oh my God. They're like great hunt free. I was like, can you get like the, like the amount of constant you get? There's nothing but love. Yeah. Just nice people. Yeah. It was awesome. Oh, so it's weird isn't it? Oh yeah, it's, it's, and it's, you can see it's changed so much. Like for me it's changed so much in the last few years. Yeah. It's just for everybody. Yeah. Everybody, all of us. Yeah. It's changed. And then the other thing that like we do now is we do our podcast live and it's like, it's, it's like a different type of live performance.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       Right. You know, it's so fun to go. Yeah. You have a totally different thing going on. You guys have like a live show. Yeah. It's like a show, you know, it's like, uh, like uh, an actual performance. But your podcast fits that well because your podcast has a lot of like reoccurring Skitch sketches or skits. Calm segments almost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Betsy, do you have a bunch of reoccurring things that you do people look forward to? They look forward to? So what we try to do on those live ones is like, if we know they look forward to it, we'll try to at least do a couple of them and it gets the crowds so excited about it. So it's like a fun thing. It's like, it's almost like the equivalent of being a band and you have a couple of hits, you know what I mean? Right there where they, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       they liked that song. So I'm going to play the song at some point because I know that's why you showed up, right? Yeah. So yeah, it's, it's pretty fun, man. It's changed everything though for for our standup too. Yeah. It's weird, right? It's, it's so crazy. It's weird that it all happened out of the Internet to everybody thought they had to get on TV. Everybody thought that the way to get a fan base has to be on TV, but that's actually the way to get a fan base. It doesn't really know you exactly. Like if you're on a sitcom like Mike and Molly, Billy Gardell, very funny guy and he's going to go see him. Great Guy. Very good guy. Great Guy. Funny Guy. You know, good for him. He's got a sitcom, it's great. But if you want to go see him, you, you, you're going to see the funny guy that you see on that show playing a character.

Speaker 6:          00:33:23       It's not him doing stand up. If you go to see him doing, stand up, you, you know, like you know him in a form of what he does. Right. But you don't know him right? When they go to cu, they fucking know you, right? I mean, you and I look, the way we talk right now is the way we talk when we shut this thing off. Right? If we shut it off, it would be real similar. We'd be talking shit. You tell me what Joey actually said. That's it be the only difference. That'd be the only difference in this conversation. And I think, um, it's the best way to get a good crowd or an asshole crowd. If you're an asshole and you promote assholishness behavior, I fucking seen it, man. Have you seen it? Absolutely. With who? I can't tell you who does the name rhymed with.

Speaker 6:          00:34:04       No, but somebody, it's somebody I don't think you know. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't know that dude. You don't know this guy I've seen, I've seen crazy. They're real tall. Yeah. Uh, I've seen, I've seen people cultivate those and I've also, the other thing I've seen is people who have that problem. You're talking about guys, and I say it as a problem is that they might be a certain way. Then they do this show that's not like them and you draw a crowd who was like, I thought you were going to be this type of humor. Right. That's the great thing about doing your like your like it works out great. I'll tell you it works out great for us. The guy like tosh where he does his style of jokes on tosh 0.0 if you're not responding to what he's doing on that show, if you don't like that, you're not going to like a stand up.

Speaker 6:          00:34:50       But if you like what that show and you like those jokes, you're going to love seeing Daniel Tosh live. You know it's the smartest way to promote his live standup is doing that show. Yes, his wheel house. It's great. It's fucking funny to, it's great. It's so funny. He has some good writers on that show. He does. Yeah. He's a funny guy. He's a really funny guy. He's a good guy too, man. It's a really good guy. It's nice. It's nice one good guys. Make it definitely. Oh, Joey Diaz was talking about Kevin Hart about what a Great Guy Kevin Hart is because Joey's in that new movie with them. Oh, Robert De Niro and semesters alone, whatever it is. They're like, yeah, ed. And they're going to box people. Do people understand bleeding? Do you understand? Like how hard it is to stop blood from, you know, pouring out of your fucking brain when you're 80 and you're getting punched in the head.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Like the idea that movie is more preposterous than Godzilla. That the idea, that movie that you're going to live, is it like former champs for him? Yeah, a former boxers and they hate each other. [inaudible] good to go do it one more time and they're like 80 this is like, it's so irresponsible to, yeah, because you know what, when you're 80 and you take head injuries, you don't fucking recover from ever. I mean the suspension of disbelief involved in watching two old guys beat the fuck out of each other on TV. This, nobody would pay for that. It would be sad. Like if you saw Larry Holmes today and Larry Holmes fought, you know, bone crusher Smith today. I mean it would really be sad to watch and Larry is at least 15 maybe even 20 years younger than Stallone. How, how hurt would these guys be you think during the fight?

Speaker 3:          00:36:30       What did they just, they die. They both die. Sylvester Stallone, Jews to the Gills pay 72 years old. It's grapes. Fantastic. He would murder, I'm sure Merde de Niro. Unless the hero God on the sauce as well. Deniro would have to be on the sauce for at least a year. Maybe he has, I mean, so many men are on testosterone replacement now. They have commercials for it on television. Totally. But I have feeling that the levels that Sylvester Stallone takes are very high. Yeah. He's got really low body fat too. I mean, we've seen a picture of him walking down Beverly Hills and you see the veins in his forearms. No, dude, it's still from this movie that looks crazy as shit. We're selling gay for some of us just doing fine. Yeah, I'm fine with that. Give me your flavor. I met the guy, I had to interview them for a spike TV and he couldn't be nicer.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       Yeah. Normal like didn't give a fuck. He's, he's been there, done that for so fucking long. That's the reason why he has like a sense of humor about himself now that maybe he didn't when he was younger. Like he's very relaxed man. Yeah. He's very like talking to him could not have been like easier and smoother. Like when you're talking to like someone and you interview someone, a lot of the conversation depends on whether or not that person is relaxed, whether or not they're comfortable and if they're not comfortable, man, the conversations kind of sucked. It gets hard to do with him. He's just at ease, laughing and joking and you know, made, made some joke about his mother, his intelligence and just, he was just funny man. Yeah. Relaxed. Yeah. That's cool. But you're not supposed to look like that when you're seven Nissan. No, that's ridiculous. I was like the most notoriously difficult interview. Well, he doesn't want to do it right and he shouldn't. You know, I think a guy like that as dessert, he's earned the right to talk to whoever he wants to talk to and that's it. And if he doesn't want to be interviewed about things, I don't need to know him. He can tell me about him, what he wants to tell me about him. I don't need to know him. And I think

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       the, the, the beauty of being an actor, there's probably some, there's probably some merit and some extra power in me not knowing him and knowing that he can go from being the guy in taxi driver to, you know, being, you know, fill in the blank. Being the guy from the godfather to me, he can morph, he can change who he is. Being the guy from Cape Fear, he can morph. And I think if you know too much of what he is really like, could you imagine on the flight safe Deniro had a podcast and on the podcast every day, who's got his glasses over his nose either, Ooh, see what we got here. And he's, she's reading things. And he's giving you his opinions on things. I like flowers when actors start doing that. It puts them in a weird category. It's true. It's true. And it almost like the ideal way to be an actor would be to do no press.

Speaker 6:          00:39:25       Yeah. They do press because they have to, you know, a lot of times they're contractually obligated to do press to promote movies and it's all about promoting, but it does, you know, the more you know that person, the harder it is to see them playing characters. Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Things get weird. Like, like that was one of the things that was, that people relished about that. Um, the audio that was leaked of Christian Bale screaming at some guy on the set. Yeah. And a lot of people are like, wow, he's a fucking asshole. He's an asshole. And Yeah, he's definitely obviously very aggressive. But what people, what people liked about that is they got to see a human like with no script, no. Okay, I'm going to go sit on the couch with Oprah. No chatting here with David Letterman, with my legs crossed. Like I would never do in real life because none of that.

Speaker 6:          00:40:20       He's like, for fuck's sake, man. You're a fucking amateur. Just screaming at some lighting guy. Yeah. There's a Sylvester Stallone at like 70 Oh my God. It's not a joke either. He's like 70. How old is he? 67 that's like 70. That's amazing. Yeah. Um, my grandpa didn't look like that when he was 67 matter of fact, I think that's around when he died of old age. I think my grandpa died of old age, around 60 sounds 70 but he didn't look like that. No at all. No. My grandpa stopped looking like that. Like 63 six there's just something weird about that man. The idea that you can have a movie where these two dudes who were in their late sixties punch each other in the head and their brains just are fine. So that was when he was young. It's sexy. That was the old days.

Speaker 6:          00:41:14       Look, you know, I could tell that beautiful face. Very unusual face check. I'd let them send it in. Yeah, just for that unusual. Just for that face. Just that seventies. Look the fucking jacket on that beautiful hair. It's feathers. Feathers, not even hair follicles. Yeah. He's um, he's the canary in the coal mine for all who don't want to get old. That's what you can look like. You might be a workout animal at 67 too. Huh? I don't know. I don't know if I can keep it up. I don't know. You gotta face the inevitability of your own demise at some point in time. I would assume that you can keep up a certain amount, but um, our buddy Jimmy just had a fucking hip replacement. Mark Coleman, former UFC heavyweight champion. The first actually UFC heavyweight champion just had a hip replacement. The Hammer, the hammer hammer. Great Guy.

Speaker 6:          00:42:02       Hiphop told me. Yeah, he told me he was in fucking pain for a long time and just couldn't do anything about it. It's like the, the amount of work that you have to do to be like a high level amateur wrestler. Yeah. Amount of fucking beating that puts on your body. The amount of stress, the, the, just the intensity of those workouts in the, they, they're all tough as shit. So they all power through injuries all the time. And a lot of guys get, you know, really longterm stuff. Like I know Coleman, he sat neck surgery as well. Tito has had a two, at least two discs fused. She's, you know, um, an innate Neda quarry had, uh, at least two fused as well. He had it like artificial disc, putting his lower back. They create artificial discs now screw them into the, it's, it's a fucking tough businessman now.

Speaker 6:          00:42:50       There's no question that like, guys like that and professional athletes are obviously like really doing, you know, longterm damage where they have a lot of these replacement. Yeah. But don't you find that even the amateur athlete that does certain sports for a long period of time, inevitably a percentage of them all need the same thing too. I mean, I have an uncle who was, you know, not a pro athlete, but a guy who played either racketball, handball, tennis, like six days a week. Like one of those just guys who was really into it, devoted, you know, that was his whole pro that he's had two knees and a hip replaced. And I know, I know other guys who are not cause he's like 72 now, but I know other guys in their sixties, like he's just like friends of parents and stuff. They're like, oh you just had a knee surgery.

Speaker 6:          00:43:42       And these are just guys who, you know, played sports. Like they were active, people didn't do anything. Like, you know, violent, didn't do a combat, uh, contact sports. But they all have things, surgeries, you know, back, knee, hip. I feel like it's almost inevitable. It's almost inevitable if you keep beating your body up. If you don't do the proper rehab, if you don't stretch, if you don't keep your joints mobile, that's the focus of shit. A diet. You got to give your body the building blocks to, to repair tissue. You've got to give that tissue time to repair. A lot of injuries come, and this is from my personal experience, the injury that I had on my neck was from getting hurt. And just continuing to work out, like knowing I was hurt and just just gutting it out. Just a Jujitsu is so fun. It's so fun that you don't want

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       to take too much time off. And when I would take like two weeks off, like I, I fucked something up in my neck, I'd take two weeks off. Like realistically I needed several months off. Like I had an injury and what I really needed to do was take several months off and rehab the area and make sure it's strong, but I would just heard it again couple of months later, pop, ah fuck it hurt again. And it just kept hurting it. He kept doing it over and over again until I finally got an Mri after the worst one when I started getting numb fingers and I found out that I had a bulging disc in my neck, but instead of getting surgery, instead of getting my neck cut open, I started doing what's called spinal decompression. I have this like a thing that I, a harness I attached to my neck and I put it to a door and I like hang myself basically.

Speaker 3:          00:45:15       Yeah, I started doing that and a lot of stretching and then rolfing, I started getting rolfed, which is fucking really painful shit. Super painful. And I started doing this stuff called pro low ozone therapy. Like I'm trying like really hard to make sure that this area is completely healed up before I do anything crazy again. It's smart. So then I did that. And then the most recent is this re Regina Kine, Regena kine is this a shit that this guy doctor Peter Welling developed in Germany. They take your blood out and they spin it and the other, the the heat up the blood and then it produces, I guess it produces more red or more white blood cells and they spin it in a centrifuge and it makes us like yellow serum. That's like one of the most potent anti inflammatory drugs known to man. It's made by your own blood and I'm, I'm doing a terrible job of explaining the science.

Speaker 3:          00:46:03       I'm sure I butchered it, but whatever it is, they take this stuff, they take it out of your blood. Then they inject it into where you have injuries or inflammation and people feel like they haven't felt in 20 years. It's incredible. Like he did it to my neck and only a month ago, five weeks ago, inject back into your neck. Is that where a ghost, they put like in very specific areas where you have the inflammation, they inject that, that serum that's created from your blood into that area where you have the inflammation and it heals. It's so quick. It's like you're in a movie. Really? Yeah. It's like they created some new invention to relieve yourself of inflammation. You're basically on, this is like cutting edge stuff, right? I mean they're pretty cutting edge. It's not even approved by the FDA. You have to pay for it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:47       Pay for it out of pocket. Yeah. You have to pay for it out of pocket. Uh, in Germany they let you do it, which is why all these athletes were flying to Germany, but now they're starting to set up places in America and they do what's called, um, I think off label. I think that's how I'd describe it off label in which means like they can't guarantee anything. They can't tell you it's going to do anything for you. The FDA doesn't approve it. They can't say it's going to help you, but they can do the procedure. It's legal if you want to get it done. Here's all the people that have done it and here's how it benefited them. Wow. It fucking works to my neck. Feels amazing. It feels so loose. It was like for the longest time. Is this a video of them doing it?

Speaker 3:          00:47:24       It was they, they pulled out a eight ounces of blood out of me today, son. Eight ounces. Yeah. Lucky am very hot blooded. I produce blood just sitting here. I'm producing a lot of blood. They shoot it, see how they're doing it here. They put these little holes and then they have this little thing that sticks in the hole and they inject the serum directly into the areas where you have inflammation and people have had arthritis and all sorts of different issues, especially like lower back pain. They've experienced some pretty significant benefit from doing this stuff and it lasts for years. That's fascinating. Shit, but you know these dudes that are in a combat sports, whether it's um, MMA or even football, it's just kind of like a combat sport. It's very similar. Yeah. You're going to get a beating you, no matter what you do.

Speaker 3:          00:48:11       Yeah. You met her who you are. Yeah. Peyton manning actually had this shit done, had it done to his neck. His neck was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. Probably just like mine. Yeah, but now he's playing again. It's crazy. He's playing so well. It's because of this shit, man. Yeah. It's because of this Regina con. This is just step one. This motherfucker in Germany is a year away from developing a shot that makes your body kickstarted to production of Collagen, which means your wrinkles will go away. Really always kind of look odd is fuck who they were in it. Right? They're going to watch out for that too. Oh ladies are going to want some dicks on how many you imagine if your next door neighbor was like this old lady who was really hot at one point in time and lived for it and then it all fell apart and then she's by herself and alone and she starts getting them shots and then within like a year, she's like a hot mill, a hot 40 year old and you're like, what the hell is going on?

Speaker 3:          00:49:01       Can I know some flower flirt and with Ya, you catch her out in the morning. She's doing exercises and she's jogging on the front lawn. She can work out again. Oh, what the fuck is going on next door? It's peaches going back in time. She's eating babies. She must be band. He didn't know any better. You would think she's a witch. Of course. If all the sudden within a year she looked like a hot 40 year old, give me that baby. I wonder if that's possible. It's got to be, they're going to do it. If you eat, if you could send a video through the fucking sky instantaneously, you can take a video. You could send it to me from Canada and I would get it within a couple of seconds. Yeah, that's ridiculous. That's possibly get that. That's your neighbor bro. Yeah. Look at that. And you're like ice cube. Ice Cubes are rapey. They're very raping.

Speaker 7:          00:49:52       I'm not done. That was there.

Speaker 3:          00:49:57       Yeah, just like that. Just like that. Yeah. If that I get to be lady Tucker right there and wait in that scenario. No, you get to be Tommy buns. Okay. I think you'd have a better response. But Louis' dirty bitch.

Speaker 7:          00:50:11       Nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       Yeah, that's what we would, uh, that's what we'd be dealing with everywhere. All across the world. A lot more fucking going on. A lot more fucking the old guys who become studs to, sure. Guys, within a couple of years we'll start looking like Stallone does now. You imagine like successful guys like guys who were real power brokers, Murdock becomes the hawk. Oh my God. Literally looks like the Hulk and just dropping dick internationally the door with a custom suit on because his neck is 37 inches wide. These heads enormous and square, and this is Rupert Murdoch becomes like literally like Juggernaut. Yeah, it becomes the hawk. If someone came along and they did have some sort of a genetic fix like you, and especially if you're an old man, if you're like 80 years old and they say to you, well, we can give you this shot, they will turn you into the shape.

Speaker 3:          00:51:02       You will. You will more if you're going to eat all day long because you're going to be hungry constantly. But if you give yourself the required amount of calories to grow, you're going to be this and like a couple months, you just fucking keep growing old guys. Be All all over it, man. No question you did. It just becomes like a Quaker oats box. Just one of those big extra thick Quaker oats boxes. I think you know what? You'd be so charged up and so sexually recharged. You just be leaking Tj's all day. Every week. You'd have to put a little like a little receiver, a little receptacle at the end of your cock. You'd have to tie a very sturdy balloon on the end of your tick. Absolute tape it down. Otherwise it just be shooting loads in your pants all day and you just go.

Speaker 3:          00:51:46       You just literally have to drop them. I think that Shit's inevitable. They're doing things right now that are the building blocks of creating superheroes. Like they have this, um, this project where they're trying to combine spider silk with a, with human skin. They're trying to make this synthetic skin that would be like a replacement skin, like burn people, burn burn victims and you know, and maybe people who just really wanted to redo their whole body one day. Really? Look, man, they're replacing hips. Okay. What does a hip, a hip hippos. A joint. They saw your fucking joint off when you see a hip replacement. It's some dark shit. Have you ever watched it online? No. No, let's do it. Let's watch a hip replacement. It's rough. They saw the end of your femur off son and they screw this fucking bolt in place. It's gnarly.

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       I all that shit. Surgery is gnarly. Surgery is gnarly, but replacements of joints, especially seeing a faceless, but well yeah, that's Gnarley or a nose job. Oh, that's not what, I didn't see what my nose looks like. But you saw some of the bloody boogers after I had my nose fixed. I saw you, remember I showed you those, you almost threw up one of the point you had when you were putting that water pick up your nose. Yeah. And it was flushing stuff out. Yeah. Let's, um, maybe we shouldn't watch this, so it looks like a ham. They open you up and then they, they cut off the end of your leg and then attach this artificial joint. Who was the first guy to make a fucking artificial hip? Cause that guy took a goddamn chance. He really, he really, all right. We're going in and I mean, how many people, how much did his hips suck?

Speaker 3:          00:53:23       Where he was like, cut my fucking leg off. Like, yeah, the first guy. Yeah. Well, my friend who had it done in New York, according to our friend Brian Cowen, he was um, he was walking so bad like he, one leg would bend and the other leg he would just sort of swing. He would swing it over. He would keep it attached to his body and like sorta swing his body sideways and that's how he moved forward. He didn't use his hip. This a fighter guy? No, no, no. He put just played basketball on a concrete in New York City, played a lot of basketball and he was like 50. Now is legacy. There's another one like, have you seen like the way some of these old basketball players walk? Holy Shit ever. Really big too. They're monsters. You think when you're talking about a seven foot human, the amount of like torque that goes on to all these different joints, the ankles and the knees and the hips.

Speaker 3:          00:54:12       There's so much pressure because you're dealing with is extremely long lever. It's one of the reasons why like long legged and long armed guys punched so hard. It's also one of the reasons why they're so good at submissions. They have like extra leverage because they're, their limbs are literally longer. They have more of a better fulcrum and that makes sense. But it also puts tremendous pressure on your joints because the, have you ever seen Phil Jackson Walk in recent years? Yeah. Oh my God. You know, he was a player for a lot of years. His walk is the most like it's, you see the pain when you're watching, you're like, that guy's walking in pain. Well, when I was a kid I worked at the Boston Athletic Club, which is a health club in South Boston. Nice place. And uh, people would come in there and play racquetball lot and Bobby or he used to come in there all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:55:00       Oh yeah. One of the greatest hockey players of all time, all time. And when I was there, I was about 19 and a, I don't know how old Bobby was. He was probably about my age. Now I'm 46 and he couldn't walk. Ban. Really? Oh Man. I mean, not only could he not walk, he has his sides of his legs were cut open like fish, like the, the scars that they put on his legs. Like he's probably older than me. He's probably now that I think about it, he was probably older than me then. I bet he was probably in his fifties but the, the old way of doing it, they would just open you up like a fish and then they would take chunks of your leg, like your hamstring and it's screw them in place and try to replace ligaments with them. And they would last for a little while and then they blow out so they'd have to fucking stitch you up again and Bobby or had something insane like 17 surgeries.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       So when he walked, man he couldn't, he literally couldn't bend his knees. So he would like kind of hop and move is like for her to put it down and lift up and move is like forward to put it down. And there was a machine called a versa climber, a verse, a Columbia ever seen one of those things, great cardio machine. Get on there and you fucking go crazy with this thing. He couldn't get on it. We used to have to help him on it. We used to have to help him lift his leg up. And when you looked at them, if you looked at his face, looked like a real healthy guy. He wasn't out of shape. He wasn't, you know, overweight. His just, his legs were gone is so fucking brutal though. Oh rain. It's, think about it. You're sliding around

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       and you're on ice. Yeah. Knees are going every fucking which way. You know, you like lamb 40 miles an hour. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. And once your knees go, you know they're going to keep going. Yeah. I know that Dick [inaudible] hasn't been able to like walk normal for so long while, and he's, you know, he's probably like 70 or something now, but he hasn't been walking normal in 15 years. Plus, you know, because those guys, guys like Bobby or Mike Ditka played, you know so long ago that they would just, they really didn't do the most important thing when you're hurt, which is like take time off. It was like nobody did back then fucking play. Yeah. You know, obviously that's especially relevant when it comes to concussions. Oh yeah. Cause they're really just starting to kind of get a grasp on that within the last 10 years.

Speaker 6:          00:57:11       So it's like what kind of regulations that she just played. Yes, sure. Especially if you were everywhere. Absolutely. Absolutely. Like toughen up pussy. Toughen up. Yeah. And they would, and they were doing and it was so not about being tough. Those guys are submitting, those guys should have been not having any contact for weeks or months. Yeah. They were just rocking their brain for week after week. Probably multiple concussions in the same week. Yeah, man. Crazy. All these guys that keep dying and shooting themselves in the heart so that people can examine their brain. Just that alone. It's like God, it's so dark. Yeah. Early onset Alzheimer's dementia, and they're like 45 50 yeah. I think they're very close to being able to figure out how to regenerate human tissue and they're, I think they're going to be able to turn back the clock. Yeah. I think within a hundred years it's going to be, I mean, you and I might not see it, but I think they're very close to being able to create, literally create superheroes.

Speaker 6:          00:58:10       If you think about, look what people have accomplished in such a short amount of time and what they can do now as far as like gene therapy and using stem cells to heal things like bas Rutten went down to another country to get a stem cell treatment, some South American country. We've got some stem cell treatment because he, he's had like significant atrophy of his arm because of a pinched nerve in his neck. He had like some serious neck injuries from fighting a little bit, but really from stunt work that he did after fighting, really fell on his neck, fucked himself up bad. He's got his neck fused, his discs were bad, so they cause this out and fuse his neck and there was a lot of problems with it. So he went and got this stem cell thing and then all of a sudden he's feeling fucking fantastic. He's talking about how great he feels. Really. Yeah, it feels great. He's talking about was his body's growing. He's been doing all this exercise again for the first time, like really intense exercise and he's like not fitting into a suits anymore. It's got to change the, the, the collars and the suits because he can work out again. Wow. Yeah. You have to imagine that like if they master that, all that genetic stuff, that one of those mad scientist is going to be like, let's build the best fighter ever. Let's build

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       the best basketball player ever. Like genetically make somebody like that. You know what I mean? Like, and people will abuse that for sure. People got to do it for their kids. Of course they're kids are going to be superheroes. Yeah. It's gotta be weird, man. I'm telling you, we're, we're probably a hundred years away from a time where genetic improvements are like cell phones. Everybody has it just, we just have it. It'll be real expensive at first and only the elite. We'll be able to afford it. And then as time goes on, yeah, it'd be more and more common and prevalent. Just like a cell phone. And then you got to wonder what will be the common problem associated with doing it because there's always a hangup to something like that, you know? Well, there's probably going to be people that try to almost die and then bring themselves back and think it's funny and they'll do it on youtube, right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       You know, they'll have friends shoot them with like 50 millimeter guns here and then they'll uh, regenerate, regenerate. How awesome was that fucking shrink back up and he'll just like wolverine. That's a, yeah, we're going to have a lot of problems when it comes to technology and the next hundred years or so in the real problem is, will it ever get to a point where the amount of power that people have does, it doesn't measure up with the amount of responsibility they have and the amount of respect they have for that power. That's kind of where we're at right now when it comes to being able to contact people on Youtube. Like if you find someone puts a video up expressing their opinion and you're like, you fucking ugly con, I want to eat you alive. And people that say crazy shit like that on youtube, like they shouldn't have the ability to just communicate with people like that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:55       It shouldn't have the ability to just, they're abusing and incredible power you to just instantaneously communicate with someone anonymously. Well that's the thing is you should be able to do it with accountability. But even when the accountability, like what kind of accountability, if I can't see you and you, no one's looking at you and know what's going man, you're a piece of shit. You know, if you say something to someone in person, like the way people say something on Youtube, like say if you're in the lobby of a hotel and you see some guy just say some fucking horrible thing to a another guy there, you would go like, Whoa, that guy's an asshole. But if that happens to you online, if some guy, some guy just sends you something horrible online, you don't see him and I don't see him and nobody knows who this guy is and he's XP 49 k on Youtube or whatever his, his youtube handle is.

Speaker 3:          01:01:45       He doesn't feel that. He doesn't feel the repercussions of that. You know? It's almost like you have this incredible ability, but you don't have any responsibility that comes along with it. You don't have any ethics that go along with it because you don't respect it. You didn't develop it yourself. They just got online. You know? It's like, it's so easy to just get online. You know? You don't even have to have your own computer because your computer, you get online and remember you're going to Carroll full queue. You can do anything you want that, that, that access is so common that people who don't, you know, they probably are too stupid for anything that powerful. That's the same argument about guns. It's the same argument about a lot of different things and dangerous thing is those people are also unhappy. Right? And that's why they're doing so.

Speaker 3:          01:02:32       If you're that unhappy, but now your power is genetic mutation, you know, it's a little different than than saying, go fuck yourself. Well, you know what it is ultimately all of that, and I'm not saying that it's not the people's responsibility who do it, but ultimately all shit behavior is a real risk. The one of the real results of it is the fact that we don't address that as a culture, as being a major issue, that we don't address it as a culture that we don't have. It reinforced in the kids' heads at an early age, that the way to get by in life is to be as nice to as many people as possible and a lot of times when you have bad feelings and you feel bad or there's anger or jealousy, oftentimes this can be because you need to fix your own life oftentimes and you need to get your own life in order where you don't feel jealous about someone or you don't feel anger for something that someone has that you want, like use it as fuel to fix your life.

Speaker 3:          01:03:28       Nobody teaches do that. Nobody tells you that in school. It never gets brought up. And then we also never deal with poor people as if they're just people that are a part of our community that have a way worse position in life than we do. And we need to fix that because it's the lowest ring. A rung of the chain. We would just crawl. Yeah, got the chance on wrong, wrong, but rung sounds like a ladder, like rung on the ladder, rung of a chain link, link, link of a chain, but the lowest, okay. Rung of the ladder that you know, that's us. That's us. Just because we don't talk to them. It's still us. Don't they live like a mile from us? Well then that's us, but we ignore them. It's easier to ignore him. But as a society, that should be like one of the first things that a government takes care of.

Speaker 3:          01:04:14       Extreme poverty, extreme poverty and children growing up in extreme poverty. That's the big one. Not just extreme poverty. If you're a fucking guy and you're 35 years old and you decide you just love math and you're just gonna mess it up and fucking do, but that's, that's your decision. If you went from being a lawyer to be in a meth head. I mean, I'm not saying it's not in part based on how fucked up your childhood was. It probably was, but you might be too far to fix. But Kid, yeah, you can fix kids, man. Catch him early and it said so. It's so bad for everyone when you have that level of poverty because you have resentment. And of course a lot of crime is resentment. It's not just need, it's resentment and need to give everything. I have nothing and no morals because everybody around you is doing whatever they have to do to get by. You're just dealing in an environment where you're dealing with a lot of people in and out of jail. So depressing and you don't see any examples of how to get out. And there's so many people to like, people always presume, a lot of people in, in, in, in the United States presume that extreme poverty is, you know, the favelas

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       in Brazil, which it is, but they don't realize that there is extreme poverty in this country and they're strict poverty in Los Angeles. Sure you can go to one economy in the world. We have a lot of extreme poverty.

Speaker 3:          01:05:28       Yeah. And I don't know, I mean, look, I'm not saying that people don't have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, that people don't have to work hard in order to be successful. They do. Absolutely. But you can't tell me that. Like me growing up in Newton upper falls and some poor fucking kid who is growing up in the worst area of Compton and his mom's a crack head and his, uh, his dad is nonexistent and everyone he knows is in, in and out of jail and they have guns everywhere is, and people die around them all the time. That's a reality that we don't have to deal with it I never had to deal with. But there's people growing up in that reality that if they had options of something to look forward to, it can enhance how they develop. They don't think about that. It's the weirdest thing. It's the weirdest thing about like the money that gets dedicated in this society, like where it goes. The fact that we put so much fucking money into a war and so little money into making sure that we have a good supply of people who are bad motherfuckers, people who can get their shit together, people who can contribute to society, people who were people who are contributors.

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       The other thing is the percentage of people who make up the portion of income like that. You have so many, so few ultra rich that make up such a huge amount of the income. So you have basically, you know this, this person is 5% you know people always talk about the was the the the top two or whatever labor centers, the one percenters. But like you know, you have like 5% in the United States that might make up 30 some percent of of the, of all the income and hold an even bigger percentage of the wealth. You have a very small percentage of people controlling a whole hell of a lot of money. That's why it's a, at least on some level, it's so it's good that, but like the gates started that giving pledge where they basically try to get the world's billionaires to sign up to give away 95% of their net worth. But you know, by the time they die, so people that are worth five and 10 and $20 billion, we'll at least not hold on to that. They'll give it away.

Speaker 3:          01:07:47       Because if you, the thing about growing up in that environment, if you grow up and your, you know, your dad makes, he dad has $100 billion. What, what? Yeah, so you just get a trust and you don't ever have to work ever even met those guys. Sure. That's just some sad motherfuckers. They always are. There's some sad motherfuckers. I knew this dude, he had a trust and then a backup trust and he went through both of them and now he has a job. Yeah. He, he millions, I believe. 30 something million dollars on real estate development that didn't go through. And then he had a backup trust and that went away too. And then his parents finally just, they said, get a job bitch, and he's like 50 and he's like finally in like the workforce. She 50 they cut him loose after just going through all of his buddies. He's the weakest man. Like I think one of the weakest men have ever been around. Not Surprising. She says no character, no ability to, and he even said it. He was talking to my friend about her kids and he said if I can, if I could give any piece of advice and what not to do, never let them think that they don't have to work. You never let them think. They don't have to work

Speaker 2:          01:08:56       the, you're a lottery winner. Yeah. That's the, the only difference is you won your lottery the moment you were born. But isn't it possible to win the lottery and keep it together? Where signage, very rare. It's very rare. It's possible. And I'm sure there's people who have done it, but there's more stories about how this guy fucking fucked everything up as soon as he won the lottery than there are. Wow. This guy, you know, live the fairytale life after he won the lottery. I think some of it has to do with the amount you win. You know, you can win a lottery. You could win $1 million, you can win two, five $6 million. When you start talking about somebody that was making 35,000 a year in the factory and you get 102 hundred $300 million, I mean there's nothing to prepare you for that. There's nothing to prepare you for that and the, the type of attention you're going to get from that, the people that are going to come into your life, it's overwhelming.

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       Why they're not ready for it. It'd be different if like you won $100 million because you've achieved success on your own. You know, you know, it's, it's still going to be a difference for you. But I think having a foundation of like a career that you've taken on and earn drone, you know, you earn what you've gotten to have this boost would be different. I think when you haven't had that level of success and you get something like, you know, a nine figure check, I think it's really hard to keep it together. There's more stories about disaster and there are about keeping it together. When you talk about those big, the the, what are the big ones called? They're like the mega millions powerball, right? Yeah. If somebody just won a nut, like over three three 53 55 so much though, what did they pay them off? They're like, you have options. You can get options. Here's the, if you are not 80 you should always take no the opposite. Yeah, the 20 year, because you're essentially on salary for the next 2025 years, so if you want $100 million, right? You're going to get 20 payments over the course of a t to add up to that amount. You're gonna have to pay taxes, but you're going to get your full amount. The other option they do is they go, all right, it's 355 million. You could take that over 20 years or we'll

Speaker 6:          01:11:14       give you like 158 million right now and then people go, I'll take the lumps. It's more, you know, they was all the money then. Right, but unless you're about to die, like why wouldn't you just allow yourself to earn like what's, maybe you would be worried that they would go under continue to pay you. Yeah, I guess they that that is probably the worry that's not going to fucking happen, but what you really trust that someone's going to stay alive or a business is going to stay alive for 25 years or whatever it is. They would still be obligated to make that payment. What I'm saying is like if they go under the state lottery, I don't think it goes under. What if it did it in Detroit? What have you bought the lottery in Detroit? I still think that we ain't got no money. I still think you'd, you'd still get your money?

Speaker 6:          01:11:54       I think so. I do. I don't think there's, I don't think there's such thing as them. I say take them on and take that lumps. Asked it in a good business, Tom, we buns. I think if it's a family restaurant, I would definitely do that. The 25 year payout, how much you think you would get. Okay, let's see if you win the lottery and you get $350 million, right? So what's the yearly payout on 355 million? I would say they'd probably do it over 25 years right now. So let's see. Um, let's say, let's say you're getting three 55 over 25 years, that's 14 million a year, man. What if you want to buy something that's more than 50? The thing is you can get whatever you want. Once they like you have that, they know who you are and they see like there's no way. And like, what the fuck are your plans, man?

Speaker 6:          01:12:42       Are you opening the fucking the new St Regis? Like why you don't need you? You were doing your shit for whatever, 50 grand, you're fine. You have 14 million a year for the next quarter century. You've got to change your phone number and move immediately. Oh my God, you have the amount of people that are going to hit you up. Just give me a million. You could just give me a million. You still have all that money all the time. Come on dude. You friends, 14 million a year. You can't give me a million a year. And you have to say, imagine people are going to ask you to give them $1 million a year. Do you get 14 million a year? Give me 1 million a year. Come on man. You got to be like, you know whether it's a really good argument, but I'm going to have to say no like you make a good point.

Speaker 6:          01:13:20       What would you do if Matt full tron one are you good? Play Tommy, you won $300 million. You can't give me a million a year. I love you man. But nothing. You give them nothing. Now I probably would give. Yeah, I would, but I don't think you could let people dictate the terms and how much you have to give. Whatever you want to give. You know? It's weird when someone starts asking you from a good friend. I wanted to give him a weird number. You know, what would you give them? 138 216,000 yeah, but that's it. You make 300 million, he gets to give you a hundred grand. All right, well I mean Christmas was coming up. It might give you a bonus. Would you start a business that much money? I think. Um, why would you, what do you need to make more money? Why would you start a business so you could lose some of it? No, I think the first thing I would do is move

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       like to the air, like the exact whatever area. Neighborhood Home I desire the most that way. Would that be, I don't know. Maybe Hawaii. Hawaii, maybe. I didn't have to travel to see your friends. The problem a wise it's five hours away by plane. I know, but I got the jet now. Just hop on the jet. It takes five hours in a plane. If you live five hours drive from somewhere, what's five? How annoying would that be? I know, but I mean, come on man, I'm sending my jet. Are you going to be a real, it's a really nice, okay. How about this? How about I live in the mountains. Five hours drive up the top of a mountain. How often are you going to visit me? But can I have a second home in Hawaii? Yes. You could have a second home in Hawaii, but where are you going to live?

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       Primary residence. That's a good question. Let me give up on Hollywood. I mean I think the motivation here anymore. Well yeah, I mean but I mean cause you can just stand up from anywhere. If I started doing standup he wouldn't eat their fucking whore money. Yeah, there God damn devil do whatever I want. That's a great, that's a great actual, it's just where do you want to live the most? Where would it be? Um, I still love California. Maybe. Maybe either summer beach. I like the beaches. So maybe Santa, Barbara's Nice Santa Barbara. Maybe look more relaxed, less people. Beach Front, Laguna beach kind of thing. Newport that area. That's kind of Nice so far. Um, Santa Barbara is beautiful. But then I also love, I mean fuck, I mean if you have $350 million, you probably buy your houses wherever you want. Buy a house in Seattle and New York where you decided to live.

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       Definitely. Look at you. You love cows. I Love California. Do you represent? Yeah. Do you wear like an la hat fucking heart? People know you represent. Yeah, it's fun. I love it. I would defend it. What people live in shitty places and they have the nerve to shit on where we live. It's, it's unbelievable. You do these fucking dog shit towns and they're like, you live in La. I'd never want to go there. I'm like, clearly you have shit taste. I'm here because they're paying me. I can't wait to get the fuck out. So you stay man, stay here. We don't need you at all. Well, people's ideas of California being bad or never visited half the time they're like, it's their idea of what California is. That it's all Kanye west out here. It's like a hundred million Kanye West. Yeah. But he's yelling and I'm the greatest ever.

Speaker 2:          01:16:28       And then Christina has the best, the best, uh, a story of a, it was a baggage, a baggage handler at the airport in Detroit and he's putting the bag tag on her bag and it says lax, like you live in La. And she's like, yeah. He's like, I don't want any part of that shit. She was like, you're fucking, you're putting tags on bags and Detroit. You don't want to check out la. Like what the fuck is your problem? And he like, well, it's all that celebrity shit. That's the other thing is they go, the city is red carpet. Like they think that it's like, and they think that because you live in La, let's say, and you're not a celebrity, they're like, you must be obsessed with celebrity culture. Yeah. That's the perception. Like, Oh, you're out there chasing celebrities. Like what are you talking about man?

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       Yeah. I've heard guys also say ridiculous shit. Like, you know, you, you couldn't ever meet a girl out here man, because a girls just want to be famous dudes in La. Yeah. How many famous people do you think there are just regular guys get laid to out here? Oh, for sure. What are you talking about? Like what, what's this based on? What studies did you, the funny thing too is for people that don't live here, even like whether you're a performer, whether you're working in any type of the entertainment business at all, for the most part when you're in La and people spot celebrities, nobody gives a shit. It's the opposite of outside of La. Like people see celebrities at most that I've ever seen is people are like, how's it going man? Big Fan. Like nobody, people mind their business in La. It's a big difference between that and a place where they don't get to see somebody who is on TV and a regular basis.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       Yeah. Becomes passe on here. Like, oh, there's that guy. Yeah. Which is probably better, you know? Sure. Definitely better. Yeah. You stand out less. And I totally feel like the, um, the Cliche, what weather conversation that we all have is, it's, you know, when people are like, it's overdone, it's underdone, it's, it's not spoken about enough. Whether it's everything. Don't act like having great weather isn't one of the greatest perks of where you live or, or the worst part of where you live. It's w we were talking about that. Like everybody talk. Yeah, it's cause it's fucking awesome here. It's amazing and it's amazing about 96% of the time and we're going to act like that doesn't play a huge part and why this place is great. Of course it is, man. It does. But I gotta be honest, I like it when it rains here as it rains.

Speaker 2:          01:18:47       So rarely I liked, I liked that it mixes up. It's fun. Of course you'd like to change, but the fact that like there are people suffering for not a day or a week, months and months of the year and you have the fucking top down in your car. Like it's not really something that you can ignore. It's pretty fantastic. And it's sunny, sunny, not just nice out. Like temperature wise you get sun and you feel it and it feels good. Oh yeah. And there's the ocean with fucking sailboat going by what a nice day it is today. Okay. Yeah, it sucks.

Speaker 2:          01:19:20       Everything sucks. I think for a lot of people that say la socks, there's, there's a bunch of factors. The traffic is a big one. The fake, uh, fakeness, fake communication that you get here, the fake people. You get a lot of fake shit here as opposed to like what you get in the east coast, you get you, you get more authenticity I think, on a, in, in places where people have to deal with weather and people don't deal as much with actors. Yeah. It's part of the, it's one of the downsides of this area, but it's not enough of a downside that it makes it suck. Right. The traffic is enough. That makes sense. But can I say one thing about traffic? Traffic here is terrible. Yeah. New York City, Washington, DC, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, all these

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       cities have absolutely disastrous rush hours and traffic all the fucking time. If you want to live in a big metropolitan area, it's just one of the things that comes with it. Yeah. If you want to try to drive from Long Island into Manhattan, Oh my God. You want to try and do it in the morning. Get to word luck dude. Good luck with that one. So I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe the line. I was like this is, I was staying in Long Island and driving into New York for something while ago. Yeah. And uh, I remember being on the highway going, if I had to do this every day I probably go fucking crazy. Yeah. Cause it was hours and it's because of the fucking toll too. That's another level of bullshit that you have to deal with in New York that you don't have to deal with here.

Speaker 6:          01:20:50       Everywhere you go fucking costs you money. Yeah. Everywhere, every fucking bridge. The turnpike, Turnpike, you got to stop all the time he stopped and he got to pay. Aren't those fees now like create like a deal money, 14 bucks mean that like that's not chairmen to to drive over a bridge. Fuck you back and forth. Bridget was paid for a long ass time ago too. Yeah that's, that's pretty nuts bin and then dammit. But I will say this, my favorite part of the country is like people wise is definitely the Midwest. I love people in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio and I love those people. They're really authentic. They're nice people. The salt of the earth. And I think that's also because they don't have to deal with show business. They don't have to deal with show business. They have less stress cause there's not as much traffic and they have character because they have to deal with fucking country weather all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:21:42       Yeah. Is something about being happy and you know, dealing with a little bit of struggle. I don't think you can get there. Like I think growing up in California is like winning the lottery. I think what you're dealing with is like an earned respect for the weather here. Because you're from Cincinnati and you live in Florida. You lived in a bunch of places where it sucks. Right? And then you come here and you're like, oh wait a minute. Did you do, what are you talking about? This place is perfect, but one of the reasons why you're interesting is because you didn't grow up here. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah. So it's great to come here once you're a developed human. I agree. I agree. And I, I do think the other thing too about, the reason I get defensive about like, you know, California, southern California is the amount of people who go out of their way to tell you that they like, we weren't even talking about that dude. You know what I mean? Like, oh, could I ask you? And they're like, yeah, you know, they think it's all the cadet cardiacs yeah, I know. It's just fun. That was all city is keeping up with the Kardashians. Please.

Speaker 6:          01:22:45       There's a lot of people here, man. A lot of good people though. Giant number. You know, when you think about 20 million plus Mexicans, what does that really boil out to do? They didn't even have any idea how many illegal aliens are here. I don't think we have a real idea. I mean, how could they? They're illegal aliens. Yeah. It's like trying to like figure out how many deer or in a patch of land. Our state has about 40 million people. 20 million. That's pretty crazy. And how many of those people do you think are illegal? Mexicans? Um, probably, um, around 15. So you don't have, fuck, that is man, that those people can never go to college, can never get a driver's license, can never vote, can never, but they live here with their basically American or pretend they're not American and like you're not really American.

Speaker 6:          01:23:33       No, no, no. You didn't do it right. He didn't do it the way we say you got to do it, but they've been here for 20, 30 years, but don't, they can't actually go and get a driver's license. Right. Can you just go in and get that without even, I don't think you can for paperwork. I think, uh, the terminator stopped that Shit. Really? They were going to do that. But uh, I think he stepped in. That'll be the next California, even though it's already part of the conversation. That'll be the next huge thing is going to be immigration reform. Well, you know, you're not going to stop people from driving by not by telling them they can't have a driver's license. You're just going to create a bunch of illegal drivers. They're grown adults. If they have a job and they save up some money, they get a car by hook or by Crook, they figured out how to get it on the road and then they drive around because this is what they've got to do and when you arrest them and you take the car away, you're just stealing from them.

Speaker 6:          01:24:17       What you really should do is figure out a way to make them be a paying part of the culture. Right? The other problem is they'll, the, the big thing that people don't talk about with illegal aliens is they're not paying taxes. Because if you're getting paid in cash and you think about that, what are the odds that people that are getting paid in cash or paying the proper amount, oh, please. You know, he, he catch some guy and he's a a day worker, right? He's working on construction sites and they're paying them cash. Yeah. That guy's not going to report any in that endeavor. And you know, you say, well, Hey, he shouldn't have to pay taxes. He doesn't make much money in the first place. Oh well, if that's our attitude, then we better go to those fucking people working at Mcdonald's cause they're getting robbed.

Speaker 6:          01:24:55       Someone's taken from their paycheck. They have to give to solve security. Everybody does. Now there's, there's bill yet many billions unaccounted for a count of four. That would be, and I'm not saying that it shouldn't be at least difficult to become a citizen. I think you should speak a little bit of English, at least a little bit. Make an effort. You should have no violent criminal history, you know, and whatever other crimes you've done, it should be really decided whether or not we want to include you in our culture. And if they're not included their culture, we get rid of them. This weird thing we do well, we just sort of tolerate them. You know, we should let him be Americans that every American has. God Damn immigrant. Yeah. Every one of them. Oh, I know. I mean the balls to be like, well that's what we are.

Speaker 6:          01:25:37       We're a nation of immigrants. That's the whole country. This is ridiculous. Yeah, it's, it's really taking advantage of the fact that these poor people, you know, they're going to be here whether we like it or not. So let's just, you know, you got to find a way to make it work. I mean, the worst part of that whole thing is, is when you have people who came here illegally, had kids here who are now an American citizen, and we're going to ship the parents out. I mean, that's crazy. I didn't like doing that to your kids. Like how

Speaker 3:          01:26:03       awful. It's awful. And for the longest time, the kids weren't able to go to college. The kids, if they were born in another country, like if a kid was a baby in another country and the mother said, you know what? I need to raise my son in America. This is too dangerous where I live. I'm going to take a chance. I'm going to get in a fucking a cargo car and hide and make it to California. And they do it. They get through all that. Their kid grows up in America, the kit, and then they can't kid can't go to college because he's illegal. Now they can. But for the longest time, that was the dilemma of the children of illegal immigrants who were born in another country that were smuggled over here for their own future, for their own safety. And people that are concerned enough about their kid's future, they're willing to risk their own life to bring them to another country.

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       I mean it's, it's a huge commitment and it's a political pawn is what it becomes. It becomes his political pond where people are looking at it. And if you're on the right, then you support tough immigration and you know, strengthen our borders and stop the flow of illegal immigration into this country. And if you're soft and you're, you're one of those a bleeding heart liberals, then you decide, well listen, we need to take care of these people. We need to set up, you know, and, and make it so that they can have access to all the things that we pay for. Because there are unfortunate. Somewhere in the middle lies the truth. And I think the idea that these people just are here and then we just, they're illegal immigrants and we don't address the issue at all. They just sort of stay here. That's what we do in California. There was a there wasn't there a movie about that? Like the day the Mexicans left la? It's like a comedy where everything's shut down. Yep.

Speaker 6:          01:27:42       Well you can better believe that if you're talking about our city, if like if you kicked out like hypothetically every illegal person, this shit would not function. Shut down. Completely shut down. So what the fuck kind of game are we playing? Pretend in this thing that they're not a part of us. Oh, it's crazy. They totally, whatever your position is there. One undeniable truth is that the economy functions a huge part of it because we have illegal immigrants working in it and that goes not just for southern California. That's across the board. Across the board. I mean, and other countries or in other cities in the country it's probably less significant, but here it's fucking gigantic. It's a lot. It's a whole lot. The idea that we just let that stay that way and just, Eh, it's a mess. It's complicated. It's a political issue because you can't say that you want to do immigration reform because you're going to lose the vote of the Latinos, the Latinos that are here illegally. The last thing that they're going to want is you to say that you're going to make it tougher, so you're going to lose that vote. Yeah. So you have to decide by vote. But if you say that you're going to, uh, you know, you say that you're going to let them in and they're gonna, you know, make it easier, then you're gonna lose the vote of the hardcore. Right. Right. You're going to lose a lot of the corporations, which are probably benefiting on using immigration labor, and it's certainly

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       better flavor. Certainly benefiting on the shit like they did with the WTO and they started moving factories down in Mexico. There's a lot of God damn corporations that benefited from that. Yeah. It's so funny, like how you know that you can always, the corporations support whatever makes them. Of course, I don't give a fuck. They're not real. You know, there are a construct and a construct designed to create more numbers. Yeah. It's all they are. They, the fact that there's people running it is inconsequential. It's essentially a machine unto itself. So moneymaking machine. Literal moneymaking machine. Yeah. Like, um, this is not labor related, but like, um, what Carl Icahn's trying to do now to apple? What's he trying to do? Well, he's a big shareholder and you know, he's, he's a famous corporate raider and so he's trying to get apple to do a massive buyback because they're sitting on a board of cash over a $145 billion.

Speaker 2:          01:29:57       That's amazing. Hash, not like v perceived value of a share cash money. Yeah. They're like bigger than most countries is a bigger than big investment bank firms. Well, they're bigger than the United States really? Because the United States is in debt. Yeah. There's, are there, they're just were trillions of dollars in desks. Best money making. I mean it's a lot of cash and he's like you guys trying to do what? He's trying to get them to buy back shares of Apple. So if you own a lot of you own stock, basically apple would have to use some of that cash to benefit the investor. The guy that owns stock in apple will now make money because they're buying back. So they would buy back their shares in return. They would be the bit the share price would go through the roof. So it'd be like if you own stock, you're, you're going to be increased in value and they would be a private company then.

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       Well they wouldn't buy back all of it. Yeah, just a some of it. And he wants them basically, you know, do something for the investor. Yeah. Do something with all that cash and saw that cat. But see apple doesn't want to bring that cash back. It sits overseas so that they don't have to pay these crazy high corporate tax rates are already apple. They have so much money though. Dirty, dirty, dirty apple. Get that money back into circle. Having conversations with them. But if they are unwilling, then Mr I can will bring something to the board and the shareholders meeting and people will vote on whether or not to to go through with this buyback. Wow. I never thought I'd be on the side of a corporate raider. Yeah, I know. Right. And He's worth, by the way, $20 billion himself. He's probably wants the biggest yacht ever. It's just like, damn, if I just make this happen, then I'll get the biggest yacht ever. Yeah. I mean he's, he's just, he just, I think he's in it. He just loves this. He loves it. It's not about I need, you know, more money. Yeah. People who say that there's no, I don't need money. I don't need much money. I agree with you. It's, you're better having a happy life doing what you want to do then having

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       tons of money and being unhappy. Yeah. There's something to be said for being a guy who was $20 billion. Cause I know, me personally, if I had $20 billion, I could make a lot of shit happen. Okay. I could, I could make a lot of shit happened. I think I would, I would start restructuring society. If I had 20 billion fucking dollars, I would, I would make some moves. You could, you could, you almost have a responsibility you do to do. So. The idea that you couldn't do good with $20 billion, you know what kind of community centers you could set up with $20 billion. You know what kind of educational foundation's research foundations, how much money you could give to applied sciences, and how much money you can give to the right politicians. $20 billion. That's kind of the principle behind that giving pledge is they're like, you have, you have world changing money, so why don't you, you know, do something, but you, you got your houses and yachts and planes like, you know, let's make some changes.

Speaker 3:          01:32:59       The amount of money those guys have. When you really stop and think of this big corporate raider type characters, you know those houses. You ever see those houses in the Hamptons? Yeah. We fly over and they look like castle and you just go, I didn't even know this existed. These 30 acre compounds with these 50,000 square feet homes. And you're looking at it like what is that? I mean the staff running that home is its own economy. Well Evander Holyfield how to house in Atlanta. I remember that. And it was like 110 rooms and it costs more than a million dollars a year to run, to run a million. It's a lot. A million Tommy buns. That means he's, he's paying $100,000 a month in his home. Just take none of his house. Yeah. Wow. And that has house fucked him. He had to unload that house or you don't even think he did? I think they took it from, I'll get from him. Oh, who the fuck's gonna buy that thing? Did you see, by the way, when we were talking we were having dinner. Go to a man that's Tyson's house. Tyson's house was dog shit compared to have vendors is crazy. So Tyson's house that they, he abandoned in Ohio. It was, I don't know why he bought a house in Ohio either, by the way.

Speaker 2:          01:34:12       Is He from Ohio? Yeah, no, Mike Tyson grew up in Brownsville. There was born in Canton or Akron or something? No, no, no. He was born, he was born in Brooklyn. Okay. Well let's find out. Yeah, he's in New York. I've, well I know he lived there. I think it's book Brooklyn born. And then you know the training with the customers up in was in a at some point maybe. Right? Cause there's Catskills and then maybe later there. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was born in New York. Uh, it doesn't say here, it just says he's a 47. It doesn't say his place of birth. Wow. Looking in his a Wiki. Can't find it yet. Born in Brooklyn. Yeah. How dare you Jamie. Goddammit. JV disinformation doing

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       buy our house in Ohio though. Cause he will, just because someone buys a house in Ohio, it doesn't mean they're from Ohio. There's a lot of B. You're downgrading Ohio son and you're from Ohio. So how dare you. He's, he's just real enough that buckeyes lost. Is that what it is? He's a little poor bastard. It's a little butt hurt over that. You guys party sports. You guys are talking shit. I don't know nothing about in and out. We're done with it. The um, uh, vendor Holyfield house, pull that shit up if he can because it's quite stunning. The grounds just the ground. So it was like a giant golf course when we were talking about like how crazy, you know, may whether lives, I was like, fuck packy I was the one who's going to come. You see how he was having money problems.

Speaker 3:          01:35:38       Oh, well they took his money. The government shut all his money off cause he owes crazy amounts of money. Right? Allegedly, this is what he says. He paid taxes in America on his winnings. They want him to pay taxes again for the Philippines. Oh my God. And he's like, look, I already paid. And they're saying he owes $50 million. Oh my God. So they took all his money. They just took it all. So like he wanted to help the tsunami victims or the typhoon Holyfield's house. Oh my God. And they, uh, they closest bank accounts. Look at Holyfield's house. My God, when you see this house, just go back to the outside photo again. Look at the fucking size of that. That's so crazy. Can you pull back and see like in perspective with the ground, see if they have one that shows the grounds. It looks like the 409 rooms built Morris.

Speaker 3:          01:36:26       Oh my God. Fucking aerial view. Yeah. Isn't it amazing that within a couple of decades all that money has gone? Like that guy was making so much money when he beat like when he beat Riddick Bowe and back when he was the heavyweight champion, he beat Mike Tyson 30 $40 million paydays, right? Like I think, I don't know, I would assume that he was like make, I don't think anybody made the kind of money that Floyd Mayweather it's making now for weight may, whether it's making like a hundred million dollars a fight, like he might make $100 million for the Canelo Alvarez fight. It's because he's also a promoter and he, and nobody sells paper views. Like that fucking guy. He's a wizard. Yeah, he is. He's selling it for 7 million.

Speaker 8:          01:37:09       What?

Speaker 3:          01:37:11       109 rooms? Is that what it says? It says he's sold it for 7 million square. Pull back on that. That is fucking insane. Cost more than 1 million annually to maintain. What are you selling it for? 7 million. He sold it for 11.5 billion. Uh Oh my God. $230 million child support cases in Georgia, Texas and California. He's double digit. Yeah. I like shooting loads and girls. It's fun. It's fun. It feels good. It's best thing. Best thing ever. He just didn't give a fuck, I guess. Yes. Not Man, but that's crazy. What's your out support payments? Eight APP is $230 million.

Speaker 8:          01:37:51       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:52       You know, you, you, you, you know, you hear stories,

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       you know, I know a girl who's sister tried to get a guy pregnant by taking the condom out of the trash and less and squirting it into our body. Really? Yeah. It was like a basketball player or something like that. Yeah, that's, that's like a big thing in NBA circles. Cause like it hosts show up. I know a guy who works for a team and he's like, he's like the, the, like the whole patrol. Like they show up and they know, always know the hotels and they, they make themselves available. These guys, you know, like they are, they're wanting to get pregnant, I'm sure. Yeah. So they really have to, you have to really, what are you get it man. And then they just, they know the process. They like, they have the, they have like, they're already set up with the lawyer for when they get pregnant too.

Speaker 6:          01:38:42       How to the file for a child support. Like it's already ready to go. That's just the, the, the goal is pregnancy. Well, it's like those, uh, those accident attorneys at UC, like late night. Have you been injured? Right. Do you need medical assistance? Did you take comm? Are you in pain? Yeah. Yeah. Did you take on, did you get pregnant by a basketball player? We have a solution, so they probably just have like, would you like to make 25 35 $45,000 a month just for letting your pussy gang meeting called me. Yeah. That's amazing that people would do that, that they would actually bring a life into the world just for profit, just for profit. Absolutely. But when you think about it, if you've got no money and then all of a sudden the, the possibility of making $35,000 in Monticello and having a kid that you love so much money to somebody who's not making money.

Speaker 6:          01:39:30       Yeah. Oh my God. And it'll give you a status. You know, if you carry it around like some famous guy, Allen Iverson's kid, sure you get status, but I got some bad news for you. If you had Allen Iverson's kid might not get that checked as well. He was another one. Right? How much money, that guy making his career over 200 million. It's gone. It's funny that we were talking about Lotto winners and how they fucking fall apart. These guys got earned their money from their skill and it's all gone to, it's to like a hundred million, $200 million did. He made crazy money playing and he had, he had significant endorsements. I mean, that was a guy making 20 and 25 million a year, year after year after year. This, this hurts my feelings. Yeah. It's really, it's really upset. It really does. It hurts my feelings. I can't understand it.

Speaker 6:          01:40:16       I don't understand that. My why, why wouldn't you take like 10 million? Put it somewhere. Just 10. You just, you wish, man, you wish you had, I'm sure. I mean, I'm sure that would make, that would be so much money to him right now. You gotta go, I got that 10 standard. Yeah. Just live in a nice neighborhood. Buy a decent house for half a million or whatever. It just live normal lives. Normal. Abnormal I think was, it's so much and like, you know, like especially like in basketball where your money's guaranteed. You made like 20 million this year and you spent crazy and they're like, dude, you got another hundred 30 coming. You, do you remember Iran?

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       Barkley who? Iran Barkley. I ran Barkley was a world champion. Boxer beat Tommy Hearns, uh, fought. Roberto Duran fought, fought some of the greats. Uh, it was homeless, made millions, millions dogs. And one of the things that he said, it was the, there was a problem with him when he was younger. It was a keeping up with all his friends, like you became friends with all these rich athletes and they would all like, you know, I, Hey, I got this new bands, Hey I got this new house. Hey, I got the end that he would try to keep up with them, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:41:22       Yeah. They focus on that on the key, the competitive part of athletes with money on that documentary broke that Billy Corbin made. What is that

Speaker 3:          01:41:32       documentary? Cause Billy Corbin is fucking awesome. He's awesome guy that did cocaine cowboys. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       So he's done two documentaries for ESPN 30 for 30 series. One was about, is called the you and it's about University of Miami's football program and dominance and how they basically came from nothing to just crazy heights of just five, you know, uh, BCA or five national championships. And then the other one he made was called broke. And it just, it's about athletes who have basically spent it all. But one of the parts of that when they're talking about sort of the psychology of how you end up going broke is the guys were saying, you know, I show up, you show up at the practice facility and like Joe's got, um, you know, a Ferrari f four 30 and you're like, God damn, he's like, check this shit out man. And then you're like, that's nice. Fuck, I got a top Joe, I'm a go get a Lambo Aventador tomorrow and show up what's up man, check out, matched it.

Speaker 2:          01:42:34       And then you each just spent 400 grand that week, you know, like, so if you're always doing that, you know, and then you show up with a new chain and like that's a nice chain. I got to show up with some hot shit too. Like it's the same thing about us shooting pool and racing on the track and you know, hitting the bench press, that competitive thing that goes into then the money spending. So you're always in it. And if you're talking about, you know, team 50 teammates, you know, you're, you're just competing, you're always competing. Everybody's just buying bigger. And crazier ship and no one telling you this

Speaker 6:          01:43:05       really bad idea. Taking care of families to Bernie Kosar took care of 50 families, 50 families responsible for financially 50 50. Why?

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       Why, why? Why was he responsible?

Speaker 6:          01:43:17       He felt third response to be like, this says in the, and the, this article is about it. It says that, uh, they called it the hitting to get a lottery and they felt a responsibility to take care of their friends and family like all her eyes and was taking care of 40 people. Oh my God. Pretty Costar. Say Travis Henry families. He's the, he's the, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:43:33       All time. Travis Henry is the all time great as far as fucking making kids with a lot of people and then having, what

Speaker 6:          01:43:41       can you, it says, this is nine kids with nine moms for 17,000 per month. Look at this, but hold on a second. Look at this part. But it's not just known friends and families that hound these instant. It's also young

Speaker 1:          01:43:51       ladies with an eye for upward mobility. One restaurant owner in the nation's Capitol confessed that she had 7,000 women who would receive an automatic text message every time Michael Jordan walked into the joint during his stretch as a wizard. Typically over 2000 women would heed the call. Of course he's rich. Young ballers aren't exactly turning leads the way either. That is unbelievable. So Jordan would show up at a place in 2000 women would show up to meet him there. He's having a thousand women would get the text message. Michael Joe, Oh my God. Imagine the pussy that has been thrown at Michael Jordan. It's not even, you can't even wrap your head around. You know what it's like? It's like locusts step outside. Oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:44:36       He says multiple suits now for people that are like this. This is your kid and he's actually won suits and he keeps winning. He's winning them because theirs, that's how you know he's so famous. I think there's probably people that did feel like you did fuck me. He's like, I didn't make a kid with you. Well, this is also probably, I'm sure, but there's also probably people that are like hoping that he'll just pay him x. Of course she's shut up. Here's some, here's 300 grand of shut up. Yeah. Yeah. But you can't just keep doing that. No. Especially when you're not making money anymore. I mean, how much those Hanes commercials pay. Oh, he makes unbelievable money. Still doing what? Well, his shoe brand is the absolute crazy. Oh, that's his, that's his journey. His Nike owns his brand of Air Jordan, but he is a huge, huge benefactor of that Bruh. And he is the number one chew, uh, among like that basketball shoes are a huge, huge multibillion dollar business. His shoes still outsell Lebron and Kolby, which is and has been done for years. That's so crazy. Yeah. I would say that Michael Jordan's still probably makes, um, probably like $40 million a year. God, yeah. He's, he's, as far as business goes, he has set up, man. That's unbelievable. Wow. Yeah. I didn't even think about the sneakers, but it's, it is incredible when you hear about a guy

Speaker 1:          01:46:01       who was so awesome that still to this day, it's amazing. His name rings in the hallowed halls. They do that.

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       Oh look, I'm sorry I was off by 40 million. God. Yeah, but how many athletes can say that? None. None. He's number one. They do that. That I think it's like a Q rating where they rank the impact of just athletes and the top 10 is like always the craziest list of guys who you all, we all know who they are at Tiger Woods, right? I mean Michael Jordan is number one. He's been number one for like 25 years and the lowest he ever dipped, he went to like number two once under tiger woods. Probably pissed. Very pissed. I bet he was. Yeah. Yeah. He apparently, if you beat him in a game of pool, he won't talk to you for two weeks. I bet. Yeah. They fucking crazy. He's just completely and competitive still. They showed him playing at a hotel. He was playing beer pong with like these people a few weeks ago and you could see him, he's fucking focused on shot shooting ping pong balls into cups.

Speaker 2:          01:47:02       Seems like it would be unfair. He would know more about the dynamics of things bouncing in the average person, you know, he took that shit super seriously. He did. He's going to be one that knowledge and if you won that he was like fuck that round two is up right now. Double or nothing or nothing. Definitely just stacks of money on the table. He's bringing into two suitcases. Yeah. Yeah. Apparently he's like that with golf. That's how they say they say in golf. He is a maniac and he, he actually, there was an article that was written about him, I don't know if it's true or not, but some guy who claimed that he owed millions of dollars or half a million. It was a book about it. There's a book about it and he, he was a thing is that he is a notorious gambler. He's actually a really good golf golfer.

Speaker 2:          01:47:45       Like, he has like a real game, you know? And he would know wouldn't, it wasn't uncommon for him to bet a quarter million on a round of golf. And he would also, um, they said like, when he goes to Vegas, he does, you know, Shit like that for fun because he makes 80 million a year. So he's an incredible, what a weird life that guy has. Yeah. It's amazing. And he's getting married. He got married. He got married. Yeah. Something Young Hottie too. She's so hot. Ooh. Well Cuban, I think she's a half Cuban or a Cuban. Just like fuck it. I'll just give her a little piece. Yeah. Give a little piece of this cash. You think that's, um, pretty airtight prenup you'd get when you're married. Michael Jordan. Oh, I imagine it goes through several layers of lawyers looking for, and when your lawyer sends it back, they're like, listen.

Speaker 2:          01:48:32       Yeah. Do you like him? He want this to work. There's no, there's no other lawyer this just sign it. You can't, you don't negotiate. You get 23 and you for life. It's a good deal. Right. And he's just a maniac gambler. Just gone off with an 80 million a year coming in every year. And that's why you can't say shit about what he was gambling. I lost $1 million gambling today. 10 years plus he's making like a hundred. You mean, think about that. It's so crazy. $100 million a year close to it for 10 years. I mean, how long does it take? Does he have a billion? Do you think he has a billion? I think civilian, yeah. I mean, if you make an 80 million a year, and he was famous for, I don't know if it was him or his agent at the time, but he's famous for being one of the innovators in the, when he was getting these crazy, um, endorsement deals, he was getting stock as part of his deal. So like, he would get millions of dollars to sponsor, you know, to be the endorser of Gatorade, but then insisted on owning stock. Well, guess what? When Michael Jordan started endorsing Gatorade, stock went up pretty significantly and he made many, many more millions than he would have. So he's pretty innovative in that sense too. It's incredible when you hear a guy like him and then you hear a guy like Tyson who's telling story now

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       on HBO. Yeah. It does it in a Broadway show of how I lost $300 million. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the difference in the two, it's, it's, it's significant. It's not, you know, another thing is to basketball, you're not getting hit in the fucking head at helps getting hit in the head definitely increases your amount of shitty decisions that you make. Yeah. Without a doubt. Yeah, no doubt. I mean, think about how Shitty your brain works when you're exhausted. Oh yeah. Now think about after an exhausting fight of getting fucking thumped in the head for 12 rounds. Now think about doing that over the course of 20 plus years, a lot of cloudy judgment. This is going to be some shitty decision. Makes some shitty 109 room houses that you have built and they're like a Vander. Um, you know how much this is going to cost a lot of money. Um, don't worry about it. God will provide real deal. Jesus will provide me with my bounty. Okay. He's still fighting Avengers fighting. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah. I think he just tried to a fight recently and he couldn't get a, I think it was a, maybe it was. Here's what I want to note is Riddick Bowe still fighting

Speaker 1:          01:50:56       cause that wasn't good at a while ago. Uh, he fought recently in a Moitai fight. Really Sad. It was really, really sad. He got leg kick. He got stopped by leg kicks, but it was just devastating man. Yeah. He's 51 years old and uh, he's still fighting. You're still trying to fight. He still looks good actually. And he's, as far as like boxers go talks pretty good. Oh my Evander. Yeah. Yeah. Not Bad. Yeah. Yeah. Well, people are still talking about him fighting. I mean, who knows.

Speaker 8:          01:51:34       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:51:35       Holly F four hours ago, this is crazy. Four hours ago a Evander Holyfield mansion fails to sell at auction. It's failed to sell. Yup. Back on market. It's back on the market son. Um, it was a 6.8 million. Wow. It's back on the free market for 6.8 million. They tried.

Speaker 8:          01:51:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       So it was purchased by JP Morgan Chase last year for 7.5 million after he defaulted on its debt. So then they tried to sell it at mark at a auction. Nobody wanted it. And now it's on sale for 6.8 million. That is a fucking steel you've gotta be able to do to make money on that somehow, man. No, no, no one cares. No, I'm saying make money. Like if you buy it now, like if you were to buy that house, I doubt it. Yeah. No, the the only reason why no one's buying it is because they can't make money on it. I mean to have a house like that, you got to check how's it going to sit on the market for a long fucking time and who's going to buy it? Is it going to be some new Lebron James Type Guy? That's the only type of guy that's going to buy it. Right. And even then, they're going to look at the angle of 109 fucking rooms. Do I need a hundred night? No, I like 2020

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       yeah, 20 is good. And a basketball court. Yeah. And then like, well we can get you that. I'm like, yeah, let's do you get that and you get like 89 other rooms. Why don't you want this day deal? Got Staff everywhere. Of course it's cool. Do you like living in the shining house? It should be a, it should be like, it should, they need to reach out to like some Middle Eastern, you know, some baller by type dude who was a boxing fan, but it's not seem Ahmed's friend. Just uh, just maybe one day I'll go to Georgia cause by that and we'll stay there for a paltry 6.8 million, you know, a guy and a lot man. One of those salt number NY type characters. Oh really? Buy this shit up with the, the quickness son. Give me that shit. Did you, uh, did you check out my, um, special bombing episode that I heard?

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       No, you told me about it. We were talking about it before the podcast. We, it's funny where all like almost three hours in we were going to, we really mentioned it or two hours in. Um, what the fuck happened? You were up in Winnipeg? I A Winnipeg, I was um, doing this club that I've done many times called rumors. It's the old club, it's a good club and it was a Saturday night and instead of like regular comedy club crowd, it happened to be like private event people like a group of 80 was doing their corporate party, you know what I mean? So it wasn't like, it wasn't individuals buying one and two tickets, giant group, giant groups. So there was like three groups. One was like 81 was 60. So you don't like, it's more like you're doing a corporate, like you're doing a private event, you know, and I talk, I break it down if you, if you want to listen to, it's episode one 72 of your mom's house and I play the audio from this thing falling off the rails.

Speaker 2:          01:54:32       And I mean it is like there was a lady who worked at the club, she's been there 20 years and she told me, she goes, I've never seen shit like that. Even close to that before what happened? It was, I mean I think it's like a, a combination of things happening to them. They fall apart that way. Basically. I went up there, I had one guy in the front row who I fucking, you know when you just hate somebody and you fixate on them because like this one guy who was like kind of mumbling, talking, tagging my everything I saw no. He's like, yeah, I bet you'd like that. And you're like, what? What did you just say? And I said, I said one of those guys who I fucking absolutely lost my shit. I didn't lose my shit on them, but I kind of tried to straighten him out.

Speaker 2:          01:55:20       And then there was one of the groups, one of the groups of like 50 50 60 people was like being super loud and like the first like really talking about when I went to talk to them, they were kind of like just like kind of shitty about it and the thing is like it's different when you, when you do a regular show and you, let's say you go after somebody or you go after a table, you're just working on five people. Maybe write a group that like, but then everybody else in that room has nothing to do with them. Right. In this case it was more like mob mentality where when I was like, hey, go fuck yourself. Then the group is like, you're talking to us. Not you're not. You're not just talking to them. You're talking to my group of 80 so then it was like, no, fuck you like, but in in unison there's all of them and then it just went.

Speaker 2:          01:56:13       Then I tried to put it back on the rails, which I was like, I'm sure I can, I've done this a thousand times. Let me put this back together. Fuck you man. Like it was like, dude, they were booing in unison for like 1520 minutes. The 80 people at this point, it was more than their group. So it was probably 200 people doing that. All my God. So is their group and then other groups chimed in. So yeah. Boone you two unrelated groups. Yes. Yes. Whoa. It was pretty crazy. And then they're like, bring back the, I had a black feature act to like bring back the Black Guy, like screaming that screaming it man. And it went and I, here's the thing, I resigned to the fact that it was so crazy. It was less emotional. I talk about this on that episode then your standard bombing, like when you're bombing and irregular bond where it's just not going your way and you start to sweat and you're like, man, this fucking sucks chewing Dick's up here.

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       But like, and that and that, like emotionally affects you. This was different in that I felt like their response to me was so outrageous. Like I felt like it was unwarranted. How upset they were that it affected me less. Like I was just standing up there. I was like, all right guys here we ready for some more jokes as they're booing me, you know, like not as, I wasn't as flustered as I've been during a regular real bomb. Yes. So you were just dealing with a giant group of cons. Yes. A school of cons. Yes. Swimming through your pond. Yeah, exactly. Why didn't the club do something about that? That's, that's the only part I, I, cause I take responsibility, I'm, I try to make it clear on that, on that episode that like I'd take responsibility for yelling at a guy, for insulting people.

Speaker 2:          01:58:02       Like I'm saying, I put it on myself that I made things go downhill. The club takes responsibility for kind of not really policing and they like the one part is I tried to, I told the guy that he had to go, I was like, you have to go, you're gone. See you later. And you know, I've done that before. Sometimes you have to do that. You're Outta here man. Right. And then they were like, the club came into and they're like, just give him another chance. He's going to be good now. When I was like, I've already thrown them out, like there's no, we're not negotiating now. Right. So the club asked to keep the guy there. Yes. So that part of that, I don't know. But they, they, now that that was fucked up, like I've talked to them and they were like, that was, that was some people you can give a second chance.

Speaker 2:          01:58:46       I've most likely, most of the time I've asked clubs to leave people alone like that. Yeah, they're okay. They're okay. Yeah. They're just not do that again. And he'll say that. I'm like, yeah, you can't yell shit out. Just too, too confusing. I've done that a bunch of times. Like he's okay. Right. But this time the difference was this time I was saying, get them out of him out. What was he saying to you? Well, this is going on. He was, it was the fucking, he was the Mumbler the the tower, right? Like, so we had our first interaction, we had another interaction. I think the third time I said something to him, I was like, what the fuck did you say? I forget exactly what he said. And then I was like, oh, you're a tough guy. And he's like, do you wanna step outside and find out?

Speaker 2:          01:59:29       And I was like, you can go outside cause you're out of here. You're done. Get out of my fucking show. It's my show out of here. And they were like, what? And His table. He goes, we all go and go, great. Have a great night. Get the fuck Outta here. I don't need you here. That's when the crowd, the problem, we felt like we were discussing what happened. I was talking about it with the club. The guy is that a lot of people in that room didn't hear what he was saying. He thought I was just attacking a guy for no reason. Right. That makes sense. But I still would, I take, I was an asshole that night. That's, you know, the guy was clearly, he was instigating it. Yeah. He was a fucking cunt. He was a real kind of guy and I didn't like him at all. And you know, I don't think that like, like I always say I, I don't have to be like pleasing to the different, like I, you know, I'm there doing comedy. You came to see my standup if you want, if you're not liking it, that's cool. But if you try to take over the room, no.

Speaker 3:          02:00:34       Well it's not just taking over the room. It's interfering. Yeah. It's interfering, interfering with the performance. And there's hundreds of other people that have to deal with the fact that you have to deal with this guy. Yeah. Yeah. It just, it's, it's all in how to do it and not lose your cool and when you lose your cool. Yeah. So it's a fucking, it's bad scene. Terrible feeling too. It's crazy. And the audio is insane, Zane.

Speaker 2:          02:00:55       I mean, you've probably not heard a lot. I like that. Yeah. It's a different, it's not like a standard bombing. I mean there's, there's a lot of aggression from the crowd on it. And how does it end? Well the best part and the only, cause I also was bummed at myself for not, I was like, I, you know, you always look at moments where you're like, I wish I had said something funny. You're here. Right. This was an opportunity to be funny. I'm really, you know, so I was like a lot of it, I was like, I was like, ah, you know, I really, they won. Like they defeated me. I was like, but the only funny thing I'd said was like, at one point the manager came up to this stage and he was like, are you okay? Like he was checking out. He came on stage and was like, cause it was so crazy. And then he's like, Yo, all right. I was like, yeah. He's like, do you want to keep you long? I was like, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       He's like, okay,

Speaker 2:          02:01:43       leaves. And they're like, yeah, that's right. Get the, cause they think he's telling me get offstage and I go, I go, he asked me if you guys wanted me to bring back the other guy. And they go, yeah, they scream. Yes. And I go, I told him, you guys want more of me so here I am for more jokes. And they're like,

Speaker 6:          02:02:03       so they go so crazy at that point. These are Canadians too. Yeah, they go fuck the nicest people ever.

Speaker 2:          02:02:09       But in the very end, the lady who was running the, one of the private events that night, like she brought her group there, she was in tears, she was crying and they brought her on stage. They were like, she wants to say something. And I was like, oh, because my plan was just stay here the entire time, no matter what. Talk about recipes that you want to try and just Dohuk these them. Yeah. She gets up there and she's like, please, I know I've done fundraisers here. Like I really wanted this to be a good night. And I see like how like she's a right way affected by this. Please give him the respect of just your, your time and like just let him talk and they're like, it's too fucking late for that fuck. Like they're going crazy. Oh right. And I see her like just like she's defeated.

Speaker 2:          02:02:58       It was like someone was beating her up, you know, and I was like, oh my God, I go, you know what, this is 35 minutes in to what's supposed to be like a 50, 55 minute set, so there's 20 minutes to go. I was like, you know what? Um, I don't, I want her to have a fun night. She like, she like, it affected me that she was so, I was like, I'll tell you what because you're a nice lady and blah, blah, blah. I go, I'll bring back the black guy. And so I brought the black guy back on stage and they went fucking, it was like I said, ladies and gentlemen [inaudible] Chapelle Yeah. He went crazy. I was like, dude, it's all you. He was like, oh my God, I can't believe people actually like black people here. Like he was so excited to see you have any more material. Yeah. Yeah. He had me, him, his name is, I'm actually giving credit to his name is, uh, tricks. That's his whole name. Yes. Like silly rabbit. Trix are for kids. Yeah. Wow. But I mean like, you know, he goes, you guys can pull that off. They could pull shit like that. Office Tri Double X. I think

Speaker 6:          02:03:58       so. That's on what episode of Your Mom's house? One 72. All right. It's um, it's, um, it's a, it's a fun episode to listen to. You did for putting that audio up.
