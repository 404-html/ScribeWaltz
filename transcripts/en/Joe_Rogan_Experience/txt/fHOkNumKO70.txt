Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Oh sweet. Jesus were added again. Yeah. These headphones, they're a little tight. Yeah. I need something a little more relaxing. I need something fuzzy, more Mexican, less Asian. Something with like fuzzy, like a fuzzy ear. Things like ear muffs. They'll do make that like some like fuzzy comfort that I need to make one day and like pillows that are like set carpet. They should make one out of like coyote skin. Ooh, you don't like coyotes? I don't like how you have these people. Like why don't you like Cody's man tell you why? Cause they live in the country and they eat cats. He fuck silly pitches to people. Like coyotes don't have to deal with coyote stealing. They're fucking animals from their, from their leash and looking at your kids like their dinner. One of them attacked a fucking little kid in big bear last year.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       Five year old kid gets attacked in front of his dad. Buy a fucking coyote. Coyote can suck my Dick and if I can make ear muffs out of those Fox, I'll do it all day. Make cat ears that are headphones. They're really comfortable like soft ones. Not like cat. I like cats. No, I mean just make work. Coyote years. Yeah. Coyote gets pretty much the same thing, right? No. You want this side, the pelt where you know the, the thicker stuff on the side. That's what you want on your ears. That'd be pretty bad ass. Can they do that? Yeah, absolutely. Heated would be upset. They'd be like, look at this fucked up show. They have coyote ears on it. This episode of the Joe Rogan's Franz podcast is brought to you by audible.com if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you can try audible free for 30 days and get a free audio book if you haven't used audible.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       It is an excellent service and I can recommend it very highly. They have more than a hundred thousand books and I have for years been a big fan of books on tape, way back to audio cassette books. I used to listen to back when I was a loser and I was living in revere Massachusetts. So I'd sit by the pool and I was trying to jazz my future and I listen to Anthony Robbins books on tape for real. Seriously fuck yeah. Yeah. I learned a lot of shit that didn't apply any of it, but I learned a lot of shit from that dude. I had to figure out my own sort of path through this life. But um, I became a big fan of audio books then and back then they, you know, used to have on cassette and uh, get them, but don't get Stephen King when he's reading his own books.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       Just don't do it. The motherfucker is so boring. He drones on, he's the one of my favorite writers of all time, but God damn does he suck when he's reading his books. His books are awesome. If they hire like a professional actor really knows how to read it. An audio book. But if you get one that Stephen King writes, what's the best reading you've heard of someone else reading one of his books? That's a good question. I would have to go over them and let Steve Martin and I immediately, Steve Martin, uh, hit him reading his comedy book was amazing. Uh, born standing up or they have a lot of history books like, uh, you know, like this woman on audible.com, uh, listening to a history book about World War II. Uh, I've never got, I need to get into this because I'm an auditory learner. You know, as they say, it's like hard for me to listen and people are like, who's that?

Speaker 1:          00:02:59       That's been Hoffman bitches respect. Hey. Then often you're in the middle of an ad for audible, but I want to get into books on tape. Yeah. Or now they call it books on whatever self audio books and I w I, man, you just sold, you just sold a subscription. They're really, um, it's great for traffic for, you know, if you're on an elliptical machine for half an hour, what are you going to do? Are you gonna Watch fucking Charlie's angels on some repeat on that stupid four inch screen in front of you and be bored out of your head or listen to a book on tape and get sort of an educational experience that are fun experience, you know, if it's fiction, you know, enjoy yourself and uh, you know, reading does something weird man. Um, you know, like there's some enriching creative aspect to reading that doesn't get duplicated when you're just watching things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       I don't know what it is, I don't understand it. But reading like when you really, like you read a great book, like if you read Lord of the rings or something like that, the descriptive nature of the pros just does something to you, man. I don't know if it's the same listening to it as it is actually reading it and like sort of making the inflections in your own head, but I think it's way better than just being stuck in traffic. You're still getting that knowledge into your brain, getting that knowledge and your Dome Sun. And if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you can get a free audio book and you can also get 30 free days of audible service. Again, it was more than a hundred thousand titles on there. So what was the book about? World War II that you were checking out? It's called Pearl Harbor.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       Pearl Harbor. Yeah. Um, another one I can recommend that I've been recommended to people that have them been, uh, coming back to me, telling me that it's really, really helped them is the war of art by Steven Pressfield. Steven Pressfield, uh, I've recommended this before, but I can't recommend it or not. If you're a creative person, it's one of the most amazing and inspirational books ever. But in Steven Pressfield was a guy who was kind of a loser by the time he was 40, and then he really got it all together and he's gotten two bucks. One of them was called the war of art and the other one's called going pro and a man, I love this book so much. I, I used to buy like 10 and 12 at a time from Amazon and I would just stack them up in my house and kill people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:10       Ryan Kelly have it and she's still at dirty bitch. She ain't got no respect for you. So you're going to go over and take her and then Cox lab or just to let it just to regain your territory tonight. Yeah. You got to mark your, uh, the Front Door to pee on her front door. I took pitch, no done that. You see that thing there that says whisper sync for voice in that Ad. And that's an amazing app that they have for um, it's a, an Amazon app that works with audible.com. It's, it's fucking incredible. Um, the, the whisper sync for audible.com, uh, not an Amazon zone. It's a android rather. And um, it also works on the Amazon kindle fire HD, which was their beautiful high end HD tablet. Works on there. Um, but it works on Amazon phones to our Google phones right there. And what it is, is as you're reading it, whisper sync.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       You read the book and say you shut the, shut it off at night. Um, when you go back in the morning and get in your car, it's sinked up to where you left it on, on your, your reader. So what'd you get that far? Because you're listening to your whisper sank. Then your car. Oh, well you're okay listening. You're not okay dialing phones. I'm like, why are you promoting crashes when people as if a good book is going to make you drive into a fucking corner point of audio book? So you don't do that. Yeah, you dumb ass. That's not something a kid about your fucks. There's times to use the crash. That's not one of them. Um, anyway, uh, whisper sync starts the audio companion book to whatever book you're reading. It starts it exactly where you left off. It's a really cool, uh, application and that's available.

Speaker 1:          00:06:50       So go audible.com page and open Anthony's. Every single one of their shows is on there.

We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com it's o. N. N. I t today. We just recently got in the primal bells. If you haven't seen these things, they are, uh, they're there. This is the first of many of our, uh, crazy sculpted artistically rendered kettle bells. I want to collect these and I don't even know if I'll use it, but I want it. I want to collect. These are, these are, they are so bad ass. The first one is almost sold out already. It's um, it's a chimpanzee. It's just a binary lick and chimpanzee. Um, but we, uh, we have other ones on the way as well. We have, um, I can't even tell you what they are. I think we have to keep it a secret, but they're all equally bad ass. Um, various things, not just chimps but various fucked up cool things that are also kettle bells. They're also balanced. One of the things that was really important about making these is we monitor, make sure that if we produced an artistic kettle bell that it was also exactly functional because there's some kettle bells that look cool, but like people have done designs on them before, but they're, they're not balanced correctly. So when you use them, they're not like universally or uniformly balanced. And we had to a specially designed this to make sure

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       that it works really well as the kettlebells. And one of the things that works really well is it has a nice wide base and it's flat. So it's great for doing like renegade rows and pushups. And um, this is, um, only this is the first one and it's only a 35 pound kettle bell, which a lot of people like, Yo, bro, you don't know how much I lift. Okay, I totally understand if that's your thing. But you can get a ferocious workout from a 35 pound kettle bells, especially if you use that Kettlebell DVD that we sell, which is the extreme kettlebell cardio workout by Keith Weber. Fucking tremendous Kettlebell DVD. And that one is, I use it a 35 pounder and he kicks my ass every time. But we've got some big ones coming up, including a gorilla wait to you see the gorilla. So the people that, oh shit, they're fucking fans like gorillas. Awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       You need to make a tick to a giant tit. That wouldn't motivate you though. I'd work out. He just starts sucking on it. It's just jacking off and sucking on a metal tit. We'll make it a blackboard and you won't, what the fuck are you saying? If it's too black doesn't look realistic. It looks like a gorilla tit, you know. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Okay. I got you. Nice recovery sort of anyway, if you've made it flashcard. Yeah. You don't want to make it sexy so you're like, oh I want it. Yeah. Okay. Anyway, primal bells,

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       they start today. We, I believe we were almost sold out as of like an hour ago. So if uh, if you want to buy one right?

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       They buy one right now because I think that's pregnant dude. Alright. You won cause that really do want to collect these. Yeah, they're pretty bad ass. Look, if these things can actually force Brian into working out, it would be the most amazing creation we've ever come up. I'm just thinking at home alone type thing. Like somebody breaks in my house and I have these like hang in and then knocking them on the head type thing. Yeah. That's a good, that's a good weapon. Yeah. If you could fuck somebody up, if you've got good technique, if you know how to deliver a kettle bell, yeah, but if you don't know how to sling it right, he might just take it from you, stuff it up your ass. You got to think about that too. Fair. These can't imagine another web. If anyone makes a cartoon about your job, they have to use all your on it. Uh, weapons. Like that's, it has to have kettlebells, battle ropes, suicide. These are now ladies and gentlemen, these are not welcome weapons.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       All of these things that we sell are just pieces of fitness equipment that could double as weapons. But the most important aspect of it is the fitness aspect of you. Uh, go to the website. You'll see the different things. We have like a battle ropes, which are, if you've never seen like videos of MMA fighters doing strength and conditioning training, they use these gigantic heavy ropes and you whip them up and down. And I've been using them a lot lately. My new trainer, Justin, Milo, Suze. I'm also a fellow student at 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu has been training me and one of the things we've been doing is a, uh, a lot of kettle bell battle ropes, a lot of like box jumps and shit like that, all stuff for functional fitness. That's what I'm really into. And uh, that's the kind of things that we concentrate on a at, on it along with the best supplements we can possibly buy, whether it's food like the, uh, the Tonka bars, which are these delicious buffalo bars with cranberry animal or hemp force protein, the most, the most expensive protein powder that we can buy, the highest in protein content, the most easily digestible, the smoothest.

Speaker 2:          00:12:13       It's, it's delicious. It's got rom raw cocoa in it. It's also gotten Maca and it's sweetened with Stevia. It's the best tasting protein powder you'll ever try. And it has like one gram of sugar and it's super healthy. I started off, um, a or a rather end off every workout with a glass of that stuff. It's fantastic pitches. Check it out, use a codename Rogan and you will save 10% off any supplements. All right. You have fucks. Ben Hoffman is here. We're fend to get busy with it.

Speaker 4:          00:15:08       Joe Rogan podcast. My night all day.

Speaker 5:          00:15:13       Powerful Ben Hoffman. What? Joining us buddy. What's up guys? How about that fucking David Lee Roth. Did you like that? Dude? Here's what I loved about that. I'm not saying this to me. I didn't want to start with the ass kissing, but I'll do it anyway. David, isn't he the kind of the king of the, just like the interviews were just like, again, nothing against him, but like he is his normal interviews or just like kind of one liners and like, yeah, he's, he's covering up for something. He doesn't know. You prepare in this kind of scenario. He can't, yeah. For two hours. You can't just sit here and do like Stephanie Bop and stick stick is the word I'm looking for. He just does. I've seen a million David Lee Roth interviews and he just does his fucking stick. I'm like, who is this man? You don't know anything. Right, right. But he came in and you're stuck here for two hours, you know, like in a good way or bad way. But God, that was a great fucking David Lee Roth interview.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       Yeah. We found that the, yeah, it was, first of all, it was surreal as fuck. Yeah. Just sitting there and talking to David Lee Roth it, that's really David Lee Roth shows up by himself. Okay. Zero entourage kind of Ben Hoffman style. Are those things called the suspenders? Oh No. Um, overall. Overall I used to wear that shit and no underwear. Dude, he's cool as fuck. He's just a regular guy that happens to be one of the greatest rock stars the world has ever known. I mean, he, the, the things he's seen men and when you say it to him, you know, like, well, you know, listen man, you're one of the greatest rock stars the world's ever known was like, yeah, I guess, you know, he's like, I mean, he's not a fool. He's well aware of who he is, but he doesn't let it get in the way of anything. But it is what in Japan.

Speaker 5:          00:16:51       Yeah, that's what he was saying on thing, but it was just weird to see him. It was almost like out of character. It was like seeing him as a human, which I, you don't think of him as, he's like, he's like a superhero. Right? I know. Yeah. This is

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       co well, I was really fortunate that I hung out with him one night at the comedy store, so I got to see the Real David Lee Roth. He came, it was one of the weirdest things ever. Like you don't even know who's in, who's in the crowd when you're on stage because the lights are bright and he'd get off stage and all of sudden you see someone and you go, Oh wow, you just watched that, you know, and David Lee Roth comes up and he goes, hey man, I just want to tell you I didn't think you were going to be funny. Like what the fuck man? He blew my mind. He was like, it was so nice. He goes, I just assume like that's not a fear factor guy. Seems like a nice fellow. How funny can you be? Holy Shit. And he was like just super like charismatic and hilarious. We hung out with them for fucking hours, right? Yeah. Like two hours. Just chip away at the store a few years back and we have it. Actually I have it all on video. The conversation, the whole entire thing is on video somewhere in this humongous pile. The are on a lunch.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       Yeah, we should get that. So I went back. I don't think we, he wanted that. I don't know. His manager contacted like that shit on fire actually. Yeah. Oh yeah. It was already just I take it back,

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       do a little compensation. Margaret talked about Paul, her

Speaker 3:          00:18:04       Joe your shirt. It's so bad and you can show your boss real quick if I can see the shirt

Speaker 2:          00:18:09       house Rogan. I got this from game of Thrones today. They sent me this box. It says a house Rogan on it and uh, I guess they're sending these to all the supporters of the game of Thrones people who are like super fans and I couldn't stop talking about the show ever since I started watching it. I had been tweeting it like crazy and apparently it got back to them. So they sent me this fucking amazing box that says house Rogan on it. And when you open it up, it plays the theme song

Speaker 6:          00:18:40       and it has two DVDs in there too, right

Speaker 3:          00:18:44       to the first season in the second season, which I already showed the Scooby Doo Doo Scooby Doo. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a secret. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       Button. When you press a button, this thing pops out in a scroll kind of HBO boner. I guess you would, you would hide your drugs there after he got rid of the DVDs if you want.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       By the way, just to clarify, I'm guessing they're not sending it to all super fans. Just the top tier of superfans probably get the giant. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:19:13       I know patent got one. Patton Oswald. That's how I knew what it was before I opened the box because I looked like a cigar humidor. And then I remember seeing patents photo and I was, I was, I said to my wife, I'm like, I told her what it was before I open it, but I was like, God, if I'm wrong, I'll be so sad. Right. So, uh, this is the scroll.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       They, they, they, they put a scroll in a secret compartment. They have to press a button. It says loyalist of House Rogan. The new season of game of Thrones is almost here. Show your passion for the series and use this limited edition case to share your exclusive game of Thrones content with your followers. If you've been waiting for a reason to catch up, consider this. It Ral your fans. March 31st cannot come soon enough. Wow. Yeah, pretty bad. Awesome. Coolest Symia girls use panties or something and that show girls big fans that show girls. It's like sex in the city for us. Younger Age, sex and the city for girls. Yeah. Is it good for younger, younger crowds? Entourage for girls on sex in it though? Entourage with sex in the city. The guys. Oh right. And this is this. His entourage for girls

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       entourage never did a goddamn thing for me. I don't know what it was. I tried to give it a shot, but I would watch entourage Hong Ago. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:30       I like the scenery. May everybody looked pretty. Girls had straight up porn in it though. Like it's pretty much watching a porn. Yeah, they got, they wouldn't, they would show shooting on the, on the chest, like loads on the chest and everything. You know what? I'm going to go buy that. They show loads on the chest. What? Wait a minute. How did they do that? I don't know. Cause it's a, so like the girls coming her tits and you see like Jesse, the afterwards of aftermath of him shooting on her chest. You actually see it hit a, I can't remember. I think it was just on the chest. So you just see it. You see her tits, raw tits. I can't, I can't remember. I'll find your acting like he didn't rewind. It ain't your fucking dredging. Good bets here. What happened? What really happened? Did you see loads on Ted's saw?

Speaker 3:          00:21:15       Look, you see loads on tits. I don't remember if he was showing it shot on the her tits or if it was just after. And so this is just about a bunch of freaks lived together and fuck the shit out of everybody and pretty much is it good? Yeah, just got into it. So it's just, uh, you heard the part about loads on chest all over the Internet, man, that's 90% of the Internet. It's funny how little that's represented in the real world. It's like finally loads are starting to represent and then modern media, it's a big part of people's life. Online loads are a huge part of people's life online. But, and you know, on comedy central you rarely, rarely see loads. Do you think it would screw you up if you were a kid not watching all this internet porn and you would think that's how every, how sex is supposed to end?

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       Well they say that a lot of girls are having anal sex now because of that. That it wasn't really nearly as common in the eighties, nineties. What have you. It's crazy. It's just crazy to me to think like it doesn't every porn you watch basically and like in the face, most of them do. Yeah. Like if you're a kid, if I was watching it, I'm like, that's how babies are made, I guess. You know? Well, I don't think they're thinking about making babies. I think that thinking about fucking, and the problem with that is you're watching people don't fuck like people really fuck, you know, like it's not normal for a girl to spit on your Dick and then you just shove it in her ass. Right. That is pretty real. Sam. Sandy, weird to be a kid nowadays. I wonder how that would feel it pin it fucks with your hardcore, well look, porn has made one dominant victory in our culture and that's in the world of pubic hair poring through dominated crabs is going away.

Speaker 3:          00:22:48       Did you hear about that really? Because of that? Because everyone's shaving no more crabs that STDs. You're more likely to catch STDs when uh, when everyone's shaved. Really? Yeah. So crabs over STDs. I think it'll take crabs. I guess you're right. Why is that? Because you're closer and more contact and stuff. Yes, I gas then maybe the natural flora and your pubic hair access some sort of a preventative barrier. Like while you're supposed to have eyebrows, it keeps the sweat out of your eyes. Yeah. That's what it's there for. Right? Yeah. So yeah. And I don't know if that metaphor works, but that's what it's for, right? I mean, that's exactly why it's above your fucking four. I'm not sure if that's the pubic hair metaphor works and people that are in from really funky climates. That's why they have that unit brow. It's for the whole face. They don't want it on the nose. You don't want it rolling down into your eyes. You don't get the unit brow and the blonde communities because they're freezing their dicks off up in Iceland. Okay. Right, but you want to go to Persia. Those motherfuckers are hot. It's hot there. I never

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       thought about it like that. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. I'm dropping science on you, Ben Hoffman. I had no idea pubic hair was supposed to attract birds. Actually, I was saying before, I need to learn more about eyebrows and pubic hair. Pubic hair was supposed to attract birds and they were supposed to make me an s on your crotch. You need to think about some of the shit before you sat and wonder if it's worth doing because that one wasn't. I say no, don't you want to ever meet? Fuck, save that shit from muffs set. Okay. And this podcast and once your a game, I'm so game of Thrones, they also send you a, hey, I'm a flash drive with a bunch of images and social media. They give you like a banner that you could put on your Twitter page that says house Rogan. That's pretty bad ass.

Speaker 2:          00:24:30       Oh, it's got your name on it. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. I'll throw that shit up before the premiere should have the premiere. It's doing its job too. Yeah, they're fucking bad ass man. That is a really clever use of marketing. Hbo Knocking it out of the park. Yeah, HBO is on top of Shit. They have so many fucking good shows and they show loads on the chest to apparently allegedly I'm not buying it. I got it. I would have heard about that. This motherfucker Suntan Lotion. He thinks it's loads, loads of sex and hits his head right straight over here and gets on the Mike. Did you hear a little research?

Speaker 7:          00:25:06       Did you hear about that kid in Ohio that weren't wearing the Ohio, that killer shirt and all that shit shut up. He shot up and killed I think three people in a, in a school. And then he got a life and he's getting life in prison. But what he did is he took off his shirt, he had like outside collar shirt on. And during the like hearing the last hearing he took off his shirt and it said killer. And then he like looked at the victim's eyes, like his last words. It's like, I want you to know like this hand that shot your kids. I used to masturbate every night or something like that and thinking about them, you know. And they said, well look at this fucked up kid man. When was this? This was yesterday. And uh, and yeah, it's this big thing right now because now that, you know, like they're getting, oh the people are getting in trouble cause how did he get that shirt past the security guards and stuff like that. And I guess, you know, just uh, just cause you know, all the families to burst out in tears and all this. I mean this kid is a fucking piece of shit and his sister, are you talking about this? Because we were talking about it like how porn was affecting kids earlier and I'm just talking about like how kids have been like these crazy kids now.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       Crazy. Yeah, man, I don't really don't want to dwell on this guy though. I don't like talking about this kind of shit. I think the worst, not only that, this whole serial killer thing, it feeds off of you talking about it. That's how these guys get this idea in the first place. It'd become special because they know that if they do something really fucked up a bunch of people, we'll talk about it. And that's an inevitable. But there's a lot of things to concentrate in this life if you want to start concentrating every day and how many fucked up people the wrong in the world. You Become Nancy grace.

Speaker 7:          00:26:40       Yeah. I'm just saying this is what's hitting the news. If you heard it yet. That's fucking,

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       that's what I talking about porn though. No, I'm just saying how how fucked up kids are nowadays. Most kids are not with the school. She was the greatest time to live ever as far as violence. There's some people that are fucked up, but the amount of them in comparison to the rest of the human population, it's way less. There's, this is the safest time to ever be alive. It's 300 million fucking people in this country and every now and then one of them blows a fuse. I like your view though, of not giving him the coverage. That's an interesting way of doing it. Don't give them the the fucking a time of day. Well, you can, you can concentrate on that for every show, every day if you want it to. There's enough out there. There's constantly fucked up things out there, but that kind of shit like someone trying to fuck with the family after he kills him.

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       I don't want to talk about that guy that that's not, I don't like that. I don't like hearing about it. It's the whole idea behind it that this kid can get away with something like that. If we, if we live in a world that makes sense, when someone does anything remotely fucked up like that, you beat them to death. You don't, you don't bother feeding them and housing them and taking care of them. You beat them to death. That's what you do and you, you saved money doing it. You do it with a fucking club and he just smashes diseased brain and then you move on. But we live in this pussified world where a cut like that can say that in front of those people and not have the normal re normal, healthy, relaxed reaction, which is just killing him. He's broken. That's a damage.

Speaker 2:          00:28:21       Human being that will never get better and you have to kill them. You don't house them, you don't feed them. You don't put him in a fucking special room and they can't touch other people. You kill him because there's no reason for them to be around. There's nothing you're going to learn from them. All you're going to do is find out what made them fucked up and you're not going to prevent that unless you got fucking cameras and everyone's bedroom from the time of kids born to the time they finally escaped their current parents and become a psychopath and go roaming through the streets, killing people to try to fill some hole inside of them or whatever the fuck is wrong with them, but we don't do that and that. That's what drives me the most crazy about watching those things. It's not just that people like that exist is that people like that only exists because we don't have community anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:29:04       Our system of government, our system of laws, when it set up to deal with bad people, we for whatever fucking reason, when someone's a horrible piece of shit like that, want to show that were humane and show that we have, you know, we have a morals and we have laws and we have a a certain way you shouldn't do that. You should beat that guy to death and let everybody know that you can't do that to people. You can't torture and kill people. You can't try to hurt the victim's family by saying something fucked up because you're a mass. Just get that thing dead, get that thing dead and off the planet and let's say I'm with you on that one. You got to do with all of them, all pieces of shit. You gotta. There's gotta be a real reason to not be a piece of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:29:45       The problem is they're raised by horrible people and then the other problem is who's to say whether or not a person's guilty. Who's to say whether or not a person really did do this. When you have a case like that where not only did you do you know the guy did it, he's joking around about it. Just talking about it. Yeah, that's a dead man and if he's not a dead man, we live in a pussified society that's allowing people like that to exist. They should never let them get to that point. Somebody probably knew he was fucked up a long time ago. They should have got together, had a little conversation and put his lights out.

Speaker 5:          00:30:17       You seem to staircase. No one is that this documentary about this guy who killed basically, it's not definitive, but he basically killed his wife. You got to see it. It's the best fucking documentary. It's like this what? Like think eight part. No one here seen it. This eight part documentary that was on Sundance, he claimed his wife fell down the stairs. I don't want to give it away because you have to watch it and it's like you find it all this crazy shit. But he says his wife fell down the stairs. It turns out, actually, I'm not going to say the next part is the same. It turns out he had it. He had another woman he knew years before who also fell accidentally fell down the stairs. Mr. Well to do like a really wealthy man, a novelist who like you would never suspect, but they had cameras running the whole time. It was foots fucking and they just aired a special to hidden camera's running. When they interviewed him, you mean? No cameras running in his house. The whole, so there's a whole trial. They the first thing, as soon as they found out about it, they went to his house. Can we, can we document the whole process? Whoa. And they have the whole thing. It's the staircase you can get on Amazon. It's, it's awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       So do you think he's innocent at first and then towards the end you start thinking that it's good.

Speaker 5:          00:31:27       It, it's enough. He throws you man. Cause I have friends who've seen in store like, you know, I think he's innocent so it's, there's enough up in the air that maybe, but there's too much coincidence for me personally. Two wives fall down a store. The first one wasn't a why it was a friend. It's one of his best friends. It's the whole thing. I mean there's just, it was a girl. Yes. Both girls. Yes. And one was one he adopted. Again, I'm giving away too much. Probably kill someone pretty easy by throwing them down a flight of stairs. I bet most people would die. But of course it looks like kicked him down a flight of stairs but need guests. Why do you want to know the ending? Sure. He's off. Really. Yeah. Whoa. They had just this, this documentary aired like my five years ago. So you believe he's guilty? I do is my belief. But, and he was in jail until like a year ago and they aired the special addendum to it. Then you go, wow.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       Yeah. People get away with Shit, man. There's some psychos out there and there's also people that live with horrible people and that you fucking just feed off each other's hate and you get to the point where

Speaker 5:          00:32:30       it's, the thing that throws, throws you about this documentary is his family. Seems like all great people. It throws you, especially the kids. What was the white flight though, Wayne? I never saw she, she was, she was dead.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       Who knows? Maybe the wife was a problem. He had to kick her down a flight of stairs. Yeah. I mean, yeah, maybe. Maybe you had a good reason. I don't have to smell good reason to do that. They hire you. I'm Jake. I'm J K and these are just jokes. Fine. We're just trying to find a way to talk about this. Um, yeah, there was a show. Do you remember HP pose? I'm Dr. Michael Baton. The autopsy shows number does, do you ever see those bright?

Speaker 7:          00:33:03       Yeah, it's disgusting. I mean, I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       watch full episodes, but I will try to watch him. Well, he, he busted a lot of murderers because he would, uh, you know, through friends and Kevin and they'd find like one small thing. Oh man, it was seven years ago, several years ago. A lot of really creepy shit on it. But one of them was this guy's wives just kept dying. He's fucking people, man. It's like they got, and my lucky day got away with it once and he figured, well, fuck it man. I know how to do this and probably wet your appetite, I'm sure. And I bet they also feel like as long as they don't go to jail for it, no one's even going to look into it. Like, oh look, they said it was an accident. She died. Oops. And then also the next one dies and it was, I don't know. The other one was an accident.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       Okay. I told you it was an accident. There's one was an accident too. Like, Ooh, that's when people closing on your son. But these kind of documentaries too, when you see, cause you get, you get thrown cause you see the prosecution and the defense and you hate them. Both. Both lawyers send, you're like, who the fuck is right? Because both of the lawyers are so fucking annoying. It's like which side do I, I hate them both kind of. It's gotta be hard to be a person that operates in the legal system and tries to get bad people off. That's your job. And then you got to go out and face the world knowing that like what if he got that kid with the tee shirt? What if he got that kid off to be that kids lawyer? Right. That's what if somebody got that kid off on a technicality. You know, what if there was like some contamination of evidence or what have you and that that fucking kid got free. At what point do you like to say like, I just can't do this.

Speaker 7:          00:34:40       I don't know if that kid had, it was on prescription medicine, like all the other ones. I want it. And there's fucking girls supposedly that are tweeting that they're in love with him cause he, I think he's cute.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       Oh that happens a lot, man. Yeah. That guy, the um, Richard Ramirez, he got married in jail or people love fan. Yeah. He's the night stock. He would stomp girls' heads in and crush their skulls and he's got people that visited him in jail.

Speaker 7:          00:35:03       Mickey Mallory Knox. Who is that you meant that the movie natural born killers where they glorified as superstars on this.

Speaker 2:          00:35:13       Well, to a lot of people that live in a world of shit and that that is a problem with our society, that lack of community that we talked about. That's, that's a big problem. And when people are allowed to grow up living in a world of shit, when there's not enough people to be around, to be friends, to love, to, you know, to, to support people when you're just on your own living in a world of shit and abuse and he grew up to be a monster. You know, we are this disconnection that we have with our neighbors and disconnection we have with our coworkers. And you know, this, this lack of like real deep being full friendships that so many people out in this life that's a, that's one of the big holes that people have over and over and over again. If you find like really angry people, you find out that they're loners, you find out that they're rejected.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       They don't have loved ones, they don't have good friends. It's ran kind of a loner. Now I'm getting worried about myself. I'm glad I got you from the moment I met some friends. I'm not one of these crazy, you're not a loner. You know what I'm talking about? Like being alone with the people that are just like keep themselves at work. Don't have conversations. We will. That's the guy who's going to come in with a gun and shoot everybody. Right? There's something about humans where we desperately require each other and we have to be aware of that. It's, it's, you can say, you know what, man, I don't, I like to be alone. People Annoy me. Know you'd like to be alone. Sometimes we all like to be alone. Sometimes you do not want to be alone forever. You don't. You'll be horrified. You'll be terrified.

Speaker 2:          00:36:42       You'll be miserable. You can live where people are around you all day, every day for the rest of your life. You can live fine. Maybe it will be annoying sometimes, you know? Maybe you'll be looking for some peace and quiet and you won't get it as much as you need it, but you'll be fine. If you live by yourself, you'll go fucking crazy. You'll commit suicide to jump off a cliff. You'll, you'll become friends with the volleyball. Yeah, like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise manager of Tom Cruise was in that. I feel a lot more screaming, I guess. Say it again. It'd be 20% 20% more gay, at least at volleyball would have been popped a long time ago if I brought, would have lipstick on it and holes in it. Not all your name. Oh, why don't you put lipstick on your bubble?

Speaker 3:          00:37:26       What was teaching it? What did they teach you over at comedy central Sun. I don't know. That takes me crazy

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       teaching and crazy shit. Um, so thank you to HBO for this, this hookup. It's what the coolest thing I've ever gotten ever. This game of Thrones thing, and thank you for the tee shirt. It's pretty bad ass. That's, that's how I promote things. The other way to promote things is come on this podcast, Ben Hoffman.

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       Oh Shit. What is science? What an intro. That's a segue side show. Thursdays at 10 on comedy central. We got nothing like this. How many have you done so far? The, the third aired last week. So people are watching this live, right? Some people are watching this live. People are getting this. If you're watching this live, there's a special sneak peek tonight at 10 30 after workaholic, but on Itunes, this is going to be nothing to you because it's going to get it tomorrow morning on it's on tomorrow. It's on Thursdays at 10 for everyone else and we got five more episodes left and I think they're funny, but actually I've, I have mixed feelings. I'm not a big Ben Hopp and fan, but overall I think it's pretty good. How many of you aired so far? We've heard three and there's five more and it's a, um, I'm trying to, it's like a sketch comedy show mixed in with like may on the street. So you see me in my real life. If like we were shooting right now, I'd be shooting this.

Speaker 5:          00:38:41       There's a clip gangsta granny. So you would come in and do it. We'd be shooting this if this is yeah, if I was shooting the show. So it blurs the lines. This, yeah, this is a fake audition. So they can they watch this, right? Sure. Tough talk. You're a gangster granny. You're pissed off and uh, let's do it. He's a real old ladies trying to audition for a part.

Speaker 4:          00:39:04       Listen Up. And they asked how goes because the guy was coming for us. They're going to cover this place with their run up to the ground. Well, fucking big money business company. Ah, sit here, you know, shitty diapers. Or we can exercise our second amendment rights and get some mother fucking guns.

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       Wow. That was really good

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       bro, bro, bro, bro, Bro. Respect the elderly mother fucker. Perfect. Got to turn my hearing aid off. Shit's about to get loud fuckers. Time to move into a home.

Speaker 5:          00:40:09       That was great. Really Great. And the last one is I came here to do two things, handout hard candy and blow some mother fucking dicks off and I'm all out of hard candy.

Speaker 4:          00:40:19       I came here for two things to suck some hard candy. Perfect. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:40:44       Yes. So we put that out. We put out this kit, we put out this cast and call little over la that we're looking for this new, we're doing a new movie. We didn't tell him it was comedy central show. We said this new movie called gangster granny, but a tough talking grandma and we need old ladies to come in and audition and we gave him sides like, you know, I don't know if they're going to read this and every fucking, you know, people want to work. They all read this fucking thing and then so we felt bad. So then we shot a scene from the movie when you got to realize that the grandmas have today, if you're dealing with a 67 year old lady of today, that lady was like rocking it in the 70s you know what I'm saying? That not the grandmas of when we were children who were like in the 50s there was a seventies grantees, so they parted their dicks off. Ready? They were like, haven't they were all, they were having a blast. That was the weird thing. Every audition he said like that exposes

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       just how fucking easy acting really is.

Speaker 3:          00:41:36       Oh did we did, we did, we did four different fake audition things throughout the series and cause listen, I've been a million of those auditions and I as as bad as they were and as funny as it was, they were no better or worse to me. Like they would have beaten me in any role. I mean I just got lucky and got the,

Speaker 2:          00:41:54       a lot of people out there that auditioning for parts that could do it easily. That's why I love when someone like Justin Timberlake becomes a big actor because he's not an actor. He's a fucking singer. I love when like an athlete does, it becomes a really good actor because it shows you it is not hard. It's one of the easiest things to do ever. You're a member of the words and then you pretend and it's not that hard to do and some people do it better than famous people and they easily could be famous.

Speaker 3:          00:42:19       Yeah. That's why I wanted to put a lot of real stuff in the show cause I'm just like, aren't real people just as funny as fucking most of my actors. Yeah. There's all, there's all a lot of funny fucking people out there. They just have never figured out how to make a living off of it. Totally. Growing up like didn't I always tell my friends like were you the funniest kid growing up? No, exactly. Like I was. I hung out a lot of funny kids, but all my friends were funny. I just, for some reason decided to get into it. I wasn't even close. Yeah. But there was so many funny kids who were just like, what they wanted to be a doctor or work at a bank or, you know, whatever,

Speaker 2:          00:42:48       whatever it was. The funniest person I ever met in my life was a private investigator. Really? Yeah. This is still as, his name's Dave Dolan. Dynamite. Dick was Dave Dolan. I worked for him when he lost his Dick. He used to call himself

Speaker 3:          00:42:59       crazy dynamite ticklish. Dave Dolan, who's, oh, he's crazy and sober too, by the way. When I met him, he had just lost his license, uh, from drinking and driving crashes, car a tunnel and try to run on and flip from the cops. Holy Fuck. It's crazy. And he was a private investigator, so he needed someone to drive him around because he lost his license. There's this, is that not a Sitcom right there? Yeah. Fire investigator who can't drive and, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       Well, I, uh, I responded to the job, you know, it was like some newspaper or something like that, and I called him up, asked him what it was all about, what the hell we're supposed to be doing. And, uh, I started working for him, so I worked for him for whatever it was, 90 days or something like that until his license was, uh, brought back. Might've been six months. Uh, but then he got his license back and didn't need me anymore. And that was by then I was sort of starting to get gigs.

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       He started it. But you still hang out with him?

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       Yeah, yeah. I'm still friends with them. I, I go back and, you know, talk to him whenever I'm in Boston, the kind of tickets to the UFC. He's a great guy. He's an awesome dude, but he's fucking hilarious. He was always hilarious. We would go on these things and most of what the insurance, um, or most of what the private investigation businesses is insurance cases. It's a people that are, they're getting workman's compensation and they're, uh, they're lying and working on the side and you catch them working. Uh, that's, you know, or they're suing and they say, Oh, my back is horribly injured. And you catch them doing something like carrying something heavy. And so we,

Speaker 3:          00:44:26       that's a lot of money. They're saving if they busted. Yeah. Well a lot of people, they'll claim to be injured if on the job,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       you know they have some sort of a job and so we would have to sit in front of people's houses. We would get there at like four o'clock in the morning when it was dark out, parked the car and sit and wait for this guy to go to work cause we had a follow the guy to go to work. So we'd be in this car bored out of our heads and we just start talking shit. And then you know, it'd be like, yeah I knew this one girl and she was so fucking crazy and he would tell some story about a girl he dated. We would just start howling. And I, I remember thinking like crying in his car. He, me, he and I just sitting there five o'clock in the morning. I was already doing it at the time. Yeah. That was one of the reasons why I needed a another job.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       It's because when I was right when I was working for him is when I stopped teaching martial arts and I stopped competing as well. I, I got to this point where I was like, you know what, I got to pick one thing or the other and this comedy comedy is what I really want to do and I don't fighting, it's just going to give any brain damage. Like I got to get away from that and I got to really focus my energies on this. I need some sort of a job. So I quit teaching. I was teaching at a school and I was teaching at Boston University and so I quit all that and then got this private investigation chop. What was the craziest thing you saw on the junk? Nothing crazy. It really wasn't that crazy at all. We never, we never really were in danger.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       We never really saw God work in you get to like confront him or anything? No, it was that you never would confront them, you know, you would just take a picture of him or you would uh, confirmed that it's them or you know, it was kind of sad. Like one time we got this one lady, if I were told the story in the podcast before about we had this lady and one of the ways he would get information was he would find someone's address and you know, like he would know who they were, he would know like from the insurance company. Wonderful. Was a woman who was injured on the job working for Delta. And there was a reason to suspect that she was still working while she was collecting a workman's compensation. So we got her address and her license plate number and then he wrote on a piece of paper her license plate number followed by a bunch of license plates numbers that were similar to it, close to it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       And then he knocks on the door and he said, oh yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm hoping you can help me out. My girlfriend was in a car accident and the cops, they wrote down the license plate number for the witness, but someone's spilled some coffee on it. So it's either one of these four numbers and we checked these two and I'm hoping it's you. And uh, she would, he would describe an injury that was the exact same injury is the one this woman had like, you know, Shashi herniated a disk and this, I just recently had that. You're kidding. Wow. So the woman goes, which you guys like to come in and have some coffee. Okay. We're fucking men. Okay. Two men and you know, and I, I, I don't, I would have never trusted me at 21 years old. I looked like a fucking psychopath and he was a nut, you know, he was this crazy nut.

Speaker 1:          00:47:20       It was one to crash his car and I'll fucking tunnel. And then Ron foot and this nice lady just invites us into her home. So we're sitting in a kitchen, but you like some coffee. Sure. Thank you very much. Uh, really, I really hope you can help me here. You know, because uh, you know, Katie or whatever the girl's name was that he made up, you know, she's a, she's such a good person and a, you know, I this, this, this whole thing is just such a tragedy and she's, well, you know what, honey, I've been through that exact same injury and I think she's going to be okay. What happened to you? Oh, I fell on the job. You know, all you're getting paid, right? Oh yes, yes. Not only am I getting paid, but I started working for another airline and my maiden name.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       So she gives up the ghost, right. And I'm just sitting there shaking my head. And so we leave, we get in the car and I go, you can't turn that lady. And she's too nice. Goes Fall car. He goes, fuck her. She goes, that's what he kept saying. I go, really? He goes, fuck. She'd go, she's a fucking crook. He goes, that Nice lady is costing that company money because she's lying to them about being, Gosh, I'm working with him. That's a shitty thing to do. She, she's such a nice lady. I felt I still to this day feel kind of clever way of doing it. He was a wizard. He was so good at that. He was so good. And we would, it would be different things for different people. Like if it was a younger woman, I would talk to her and you know, he would say like, you know, like, you know, make it like, you know, you're interested in her and then get some information out of her.

Speaker 1:          00:48:42       Like we would, would find out things about like, people that work there. Do you know Mike? Are you Mike's Friend and like, um, do I know you, I'm Joe a Mike's Friend. I know you. You're Mike's Friend, right? I never saw you with Mike. I not fuck where do I know? I'm know you from somewhere is Michael k? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mike's okay. Yeah. Is He, did he get compensated for that? Yeah. Or they're taking care of them. Oh, that's good. That's good. But I already was working for his brother. She goes, I think that's under the table. Oh, all right. Yeah. Well fuck. Tell him I said hi Tom. Joe Says Hi and then the next thing you know you know about Mike working under the table. That sounds like a fun. I know it probably wasn't at the time cause no jobs are fun but that sounds like a fun job.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       It was not the worst job. It was fun because look, any job could be awesome if you work with awesome people, you know? I mean I remember I had a job at Newport creamery when I was in high school and so like an ice cream place that flipped hamburgers. But the boss was a fucking funny guy. He was a cool guy like, and what I knew he was working like a certain manager. I'd be psyched to go to work because it was going to be fun. You're going to get to have fun. I always had this shit. I don't think I've ever had a fun job ever. I've met quite a few. I've been real lucky and, but this was a really fun one. That is, you know, it was, it wasn't like these had to be up at four o'clock in the morning because you have to catch people before they get in the car.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       The funny guy being a private investigator would be like the most fun job. It's scary though. I mean, he's been attacked before. Um, you know, I think he got attacked in a case. I don't remember the story. I think it was, uh, a wife thing. Oh, that was one really fucked up one. There was this one guy, um, we, uh, we went to uh, investigate his, uh, his girlfriend or his wife. He had a feeling that his girlfriend was cheating on him. So he hires Dave and Dave goes and gets pictures of the girlfriend with this fucking stud. This guy's just of gorilla, just some super athlete. I don't know what the fuck the guy did. Six foot three, 240 pounds, solid muscle. Looks like he lives in the gym. Okay. And he's making out with the girl was squeezing our, picking her up, she's wrapping her legs around, gets all these pictures, brings him back to the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:50:58       And the guy starts crying, he starts crying and he was like, cheaters. Yeah, yeah. And he goes, okay, keep following him. And he was like, what? She goes, he goes, I just want to know that this has happened more than once. It wasn't just a one time. Thank you. So then he gets pictures, this guy just gorilla fucking this shit. God just, just, uh, and he goes, I want you to keep, he goes, listen, you sick. Fuck. He goes, I'm not going to keep following them. And he goes, you look, you got to do what you gotta do, but this is, I'm done here. You crazy as hell. You're not, that sounds like a fun job. I don't know. I wasn't a part of that. I want, I wasn't a part of it. That was like wow was working for him. I was, you know, it was in transition and then like it was like, oh fuck, I do that for free on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:51:38       But this was the crazy one. You know, where he could've gotten, you know, somebody catches it ticket, that would be a more popular one then the insurance claims. But I guess, you know, know his well, his, that was, I believe that one came because he was referred to them by one of the companies that he was, that he had been successful with. And so a guy either that worked for the company or owned the company was the guy who was, it was a rich guy who he was using and this woman, he had taken care of her, he put her up in this beautiful place and the guy was like super, super wealthy, but he couldn't stop at giant Alpha Dick from getting in there and said, he just got fucked. He wanted us to, well, we want a Dave. This was like, it was like right when I started working for him.

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       Like I'm maybe hadn't actually started working for him, but it was like when we started hanging out together and it just happened. And He, uh, he had given me that if that's a weird fetish that he wanted the guy to keep filming it, the Guy Definitely had, uh, he had a kink going on. There was, there was a little something he wanted Dave to keep taking pictures of them. It tastes like, Hey, fuck you. You know, this is all third job is over. I'm not giving you jerk off material. You know, he's just picture this guy with a finger up his ass just screaming as he comes looking at those photos again, you're just pitching movies here. It's pretty, yeah, it's pretty solid script. I'm thinking of add Werewolf who plays the guy who fingers is his ass. Um, Oh, who's the guy that played um, pig vomit and how it turned blue. Oh, I sat next to him on a plane recently. He's awesome. What's his best fucking the guy from sideways? Come on. You know, I know it. I know it's on the tip of my tongue. I'll pull up sideways. I just sat

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       on that like literally sat on a fucking plane with the gun, but he would be a good guy for screaming as he was coming. I don't want to talk bad about him. What's wrong with that? It's not bad about them at all. Paul Giamatti I blanked on that. He's, he's fucking amazing. That guy is, he's like my favorite pissed off guy ever. I was sent on a plane with, I didn't really talk to him, but a friend of mine who, who knows him, I emailed afterwards like, Hey, you know, I sat next to your friend on, on the, uh, on a flight home and she's like, emails back. She's like, she said that you were a very nice gentlemen. So I bragged all my friends and they told me that was the lamest thing to brag about. Did they ever heard that I was just a polite guy?

Speaker 3:          00:54:04       Like, I'm not supposed to be an asshole because I do. Paul Giamatti thinks I'm a real nice gentlemen. That's a good thing. You know, it's probably one of the things that he says. He was a nice gentleman, basically. Basically what he's saying is he didn't remember me. Oh, you're probably nice to him. And I was listening to stern in my headphones. That's hilarious. The odds. And so I go, you know, it just, I didn't want to go. I didn't want to say anything, but you know, you're great. And that certain movie. He's like, oh thank you. He's like, it was, it was a click in his ear to like, all right gotta stop talking to this guy. This guy knows who I am, let me know. But he was very nice. Well I'm sure it gets annoying every now and then when people associated with it.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       You are the character that you played two called pig vomit and super asshole boss. You are the best asshole ever. Yeah, he was so fucking great. And he was, he was good at being that piston sideways to this whole train of thought came from uh, the uh, the question of whether or not you were funny in high school, whether you were the funny guy. That's where we got to my friend Dave and all this shit that I was saying that too. Like, cause that seems to be the question is everyone thinks if you're a comedian, like you can listen to me right now and know that I'm not that funny. But you could, but you could also like, I think if you ask my friends back home, you'd be like, Oh yeah, Ben was funny. But they wouldn't go like, dude, he was the funniest fuck gun from Kentucky.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       Right. Um, I'm, well, I'm wearing the UK hat to, to a problem for the UK to promote the fact that they lost in the opening round of the nit yesterday and are completely out of March madness. But by the way, I don't even know what the fuck. And even what you just said me, you don't know. You Watch college basketball. Well, there's people listening right now. We're talking shit about me. So I decided to show some, they were now there. There'll be talking shit when they hear him hear this. Well how rude of them. Yeah. Those fuckers up. I was going to ask before to, not to not talk about me, but you're a, you're going to Nashville. How do you go there much? No, I haven't been there in a while. That's when my mom's from. I go there all the time. I love it.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       I love it there. But there's, I've, I've just put out a new special about a couple months ago, September, something like five bucks, right? Yeah. Five bucks on Joe rogan.net. It's called live from the Tabernacle. And uh, I basically put together the next hour or running, but I have a bunch of new shit that I want to work out. And so the best way for me to do that is to do a club that I don't go to very often. Cool. And I haven't been to this place and like more than a year, like I think it's like two years since the last time at van. And this club's Zane, he's in Nashville. You ever been there? I remember I just, I, I go to my grandma's house and shit. I don't really, again, Zany is fucking awesome comedy club. It's like really tight seating. There's a balcony but it's low. It's like they're right on top of you.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       It's an amazing club. And Nashville is like, it's a rare town man. Cause it's really smart. It's a weird combination of southern and smart and hip and a lot of musicians and artists and in Nashville it's bad ass. Ralphie may lives there now, doesn't he? Like he splits time. I think he goes back. There's a lot of rock stars living there now. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well honey, honey just moved there too and black keys there and all those people. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's a great creative environment for that and I don't know man, I guess for comedy to you all you need for comedies like one club, that's good. And they have that. They got Zucchinis, which has been there for 30 years, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:57:22       I think they just saw addicted a whiskey and they just have to be near Jack Daniels or something. You can get that shit everywhere. So on. That's not difficult to get. You wouldn't have to move close to get anybody here hear like old country level country Merle haggard. You been to the country Music Hall of fame there? No, I had never been, but I was there one time. Usually I stay with family, but it was a family member's wedding, so there was no place for me to say. So I had to stay at a hotel and I had the day off. So I went to the country music hall of fame next door. It was fucking awesome. Wasn't really, it was. I thought I was going to be stupid, you know, and Garth Brooks Shit and all that. It was like old school Hank Williams, like a lot of the old, it was really cool.

Speaker 5:          00:57:56       If you've got time I would go to the, Brooks is slowly becoming some classic so like you know, hey you have classic rock. I got friends in low places. Could be a car. It's weird you say that. Cause I was, I was at the capitol records building a while ago, just kind of friend and worked there and they had this, these plaques on the wall of like every album that has sold 10 million copies. Right. Which is not that many. So you go to the capitol records, they were like four Beatles records, dark side of the moon and just a wall of gardens.

Speaker 3:          00:58:26       Like you don't realize how many fucking albums, his stuff. So he had like six albums that sold 10 like you wonder why you don't hear from him anymore because he's got more fucking money than any music in Vegas now. I think he's started doing concerts in Vegas like, but just with an acoustic guitar. I think really like it's just him with a guitar. Yeah. Listen, he's a weird fuck, but he's undeniably talented. Oh, you can't sell that many records and not have something going on. I got friends in low places is a great fucking song. If you've got a buzz on and that song comes on and you don't get happy, you're a cunt. Well, if you're that, that's a little harsh, but I, I agree, but know where I'm from. If you're, if you're drinking and somebody doesn't put that on the Jukebox, like something's wrong. CanNot take that. So of course he can't. You're from Ohio. You probably heard it every day. Your Life. Where in Ohio, your alarm clock every day. Do you remember when he did that weird thing? Garth Brooks stood where he put on a wig and pretend to be a different dude. He was Chris. Chris Gaines. Yeah, something like that. God, that was the weirdest thing ever. Fuck was that about when I see

Speaker 5:          00:59:29       plaques on the wall at Capitol records, I'm like, no wonder he did that. He was just,

Speaker 3:          00:59:32       yeah, look at that. Come on, man. Who Let, who let you do that? Garth Brooks, he grew a little flavor saver. He little flavor saver under the lower lip. Any went total emo Weirdo, like brooding that looks like he was in an argument with his label. He's like, look, you fuckers, I could sell albums doing anything. I'll fuck. I want changed my name. Put a Goto and then that's what he thought. He really did believe that. I think that wasn't it. Was that his last album? Boy, that's a shitty way to go out. If that's his last. That was like the does fix yourself. I'm all with the hair just perfectly. That's fine. If we don't know it's a fucking wig man. You can't just wear a wig. Okay. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 5:          01:00:14       That looks, but remember for a while and SNL that was like the Goto joke. What it was doing weekend update was like every joke has like a Chris.

Speaker 3:          01:00:22       He's like, go fucking silly. He is the idea that he thought that he could pretend to be someone different, a different personality. I'm not the happy country guy anymore, even though it's the same guy inside my heart. When I'm Chris Gaines, I'm Moody's. Fuck, okay. I'm all dressed in black and white flavor. Say Rive died. That and my hair. It's all thick and heavy even though you know I'm going bald. Don't think about that. Don't think about the wig, man. Think about the persona. I'm trying to sell a persona. I got this down. It's God damn character. You're going to love my new CD. It's Chris Gaines is moody as fuck. That's what it's called. I want you to concentrate. I want you to concentrate on the shitty music. This time. My shitty looks to of me, but one hire. Who Do we become when mood and like who wrote these shitty songs? Chris Gaines. Brooks. Yeah. He became like one of those Stephen King characters were fucking, his eyes glaze over when he starts writing and he starts going to gloss over Lelea and writing a bunch of shit down, like the dark half memory had a tumor or something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:01:29       Yeah. I wonder if he's one of those guys like you know Michael Jackson, like someone who goes super crazy when they get super famous. I wonder if he did that, but just did it out of the spotlight because he was as famous as those guys in his hay day and you never heard of a freak out from him.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       Oh, maybe that Alpha, this version. He left his wife for a while and got some new hottie or something like that. Another singer for something. But that shit's normal. That's impossible to avoid. When you got the kind of Garth Brooks Pussy, you going your way? What are you going to count? Pussy. They're thrown at him. Pre-Internet son. All my goodness. It was just tsunamis. Pussy and country. Pussy is hard to avoid man. Sweet girls with like [inaudible] son. Don't lie to me. Ben Hoffman was coming your way. Country my way. Yeah. Solid d natural tits that defy gravity. What am I saying son? I grew up in Kentucky and with that all around me, none of it offered to me. Not once. How about now? How about you got a little TV show. You got a little little sun coming your way. It's not helping as much as I was hoping it would.

Speaker 3:          01:02:28       You don't have a regular gal? No. Um, Ben Hoffman. That's ridiculous. Hey handsome fellow. You're quick with your wit. Hey ladies, if you're on Ustream and you're not to be, I got to live tweet my show tonight so I'm busy to like till like eight, but after that we'll meet up and we'll have a few beverages drinks on me. Whoa. Drinks on him. Yeah, he got my own show. I got money for drinks. Yeah. And you could find them on Twitter. What's your Twitter handle at the Ben Show? Which is a mistake by the way. Just cause I realized now I shouldn't have my Twitter name be the name of the show because it will show people say, well no I don't care about that. Which why would you not care about that? Because I think dementia is quit. That'd be cool. Yeah. No, I don't want, I don't want to shake it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       No, I'm just saying people say follow or it's like watch at the bench show and they're, what they're saying is watch Ben Hoffman. You know what I'm saying? So it gets confusing. Watch the watch at the bench show on the bencher. Ooh. Yeah. I'd never thought about that. Change it. I know people changed it before, but then I changed. Mine acts, there's some loser who has been Hoffman and he's got 30,000 followers and he follows 50,000 people. How does he have 30,000 followers? Because he fought. I'm sure he followed all those bots who followed and followed them back or something. I tried to get his name from him, but I, he won't give it to you. Twitter. It'll give it to, do you know that Twitter will just steal it from that guy? Yeah, they do that for celebrities. We got to see if we get a season two before we start stealing Twitter.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       I think I knew. I think I need some more power before I get that season two, what you need is Ben Hoffman's name you got, that's your name, right? Yeah. You're Ben Hoffman. Yeah. Fuck is this guy really been bad than an hour? And he asked my name. Huh? No, I'm kidding. Is this Guy Really Ben Hoffman? Is that his real name? He's, he claims he's been Hoffman got to find out when we take care of this. I've got my people get on it right now. People move in on him. Yeah. Cause you're right. At least making them uncomfortable with a few emails. Yeah, I did that once. Someone had Ben hoffman.com and I threatened to sue him and he's like bring it on. And I didn't have lawyers. Right. Cause I guess like I guess his name Ben Hoffman. Yeah. Oh then you can't sell them. I know.

Speaker 3:          01:04:30       I threatened to out him that funny. Like you would think they will because you're famous. You're Ben Hoffman name was worth more than his. Well I check the ratings. I'm not sure how famous I am. You know how long ago was this? How famous I am? How long ago was this that the guy had been hopping before I had a show. So you weren't famous at all? I was nuts. Thread is trolling paper. But that was back when I was, it didn't have a show. I pretended to be famous. I would email him like, listen, I'm a big celebrity and you can't have my website. I was on another show at the time, so I was like, listen, I have, I'm on TV. Belbin they're like, we don't give a fuck. I don't care who you are. And like, and then I did you think you actually had to like a, like you could do something. I knew I was talking shit. I was just hoping that he would get scared and be like, Oh shit, it's yours. And he was like, had half a brain and it was like, damn it. Leave me alone. Half a brain. Shit. That's fucking half brain. I mean, he had the brain I have, which is, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       you have, there's a guy that's on the Joe rogan.com and apparently I did not ask for this and please stop doing it. But people send him horrible things and including like someone brought some whole thing about him. He's a real estate agent. Wait a second. He has Joe rogan.com [inaudible] name's Joe Rogan. Joe rogan.com it says name your Joe rogan.net. Yes. All right. It's his name. Yeah, you wanted to sell it to me, but he wanted just some fucking ridiculous amount of money rides. How much? It was more than $80,000 or something like fuck off. Something crazy. It was like, what I, it's not hard to find me. You know Madonna one that lost find me through Google, but that, no, it's his name. His name is Joe Rogan, but people sent him, if they wrote something up about don't do that pride and take that off. Take that off. Come on.

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       I don't want to pick on the guy. It's just his name. You know the guy is a real estate guy, but people send them rude shit. Whoever sending him rude shit, please stop. It's not a bad guy. Just doesn't want to give up his thing. So he said he would give it up for a shitload of money and he doesn't have to give it up at all. Why should he do it for less than that? He doesn't want to, it's this business, you know, I don't have a problem with it. I'm with you. But that, but saying that large amount is to me I knowing, but I get what he's saying is I don't want to give it up. Yeah, he doesn't wanna give it up. So he says, oh I'll give it up but I want like a year salary. That's like, you know, there's nothing wrong with it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:33       I guess it makes sense cause he's like this is how I could make my money, my business. If you're going to pay for my business, I'll give you the name. And as far as like website domains go, like there's been website domain names like business.com it wasn't that sold for like millions of dollars. Oh there was a bunch of people right when the Internet started who made millions like before that was became because that's illegal now. How did you not do that Brian? It seems like something you would be jumped on a bunch of cool domain names and sell them.

Speaker 7:          01:06:56       I have like 30 domain names. I just don't sell them. Yeah. But I mean like a really cool one that's valuable. I have a bunch, I have a Coca-Cola dot com yeah, but why wouldn't you like put them up for sale if you have a bunch that, cause I think, I think it's something that it's fun to collect kind of like like a old comic books, but I'm not really sure yet if any that you think could make some serious cash. Yeah, I think so. Well one of the funniest lines with Brian ever did was it

Speaker 1:          01:07:19       then called Pepsi Spice. Do you remember? Pepsi spies? Pepsi spice was some fucking bizarre idea that someone at Pepsi came out with where it's like it was like a holiday Pepsi. Yeah. It was like just the name sounds gross. It was gross. It was gross. So anyway, Brian Buys Pepsi spice.com and puts up this daily blog of him slowly darn of horrible disease. Ease

Speaker 7:          01:07:47       these spice for 30 days. Pepsi's spice for 30 days. It was one of my favorite, like things supersize me, but with Pepsi Spice Spice and this was probably before supersize and this was right during supersize me cause I actually got it based off that. Oh, you got the idea from that. Okay. Yeah, because I was like, all right, I might do something where he's Dad, what you was supersize me? Uh, I think it was, well this is a, that came out, this was like 2002, right? Yeah, it was 2004.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       2004. Yeah. And, and I, you know, if there was, it was on like all the websites I got interviewed and rate for radio stations and then it got to the point at the very end where, uh, the girl I was living with, which was the Lindsey Lohan at the time, uh, she said she was saying that it was a really sick and dying. Lindsay Lohan. No, no, that's what I said in the, in the blog I had about 50 questions clarify that Lindsay's people on the phone right now. Lindsay says, hi, Lindsey is over and she is helping me drink my 10th, two liters. Ended up coming to La for the day, right over some mo cane, which was when I used to say that I used to break up, uh, mushrooms and mix it with cocaine and snort it. And I used to call it and cocaine. I mean, Lindsay would sit around and do mo cane all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:09:00       Pepsi Spice Blog. Yeah. And then I ended up just dying and I started getting like clogged armpits because there was so much Pepsi spice that armpit started getting this huge rash and they're getting clogged and then bow wow was helping me out with money or something. Like I can't remember, but it was really fun. Here's why I liked that so much too. Why is that any different than supersize me really? Because why would you think eating nothing but Mcdonald's is any more or less healthy than Pepsi spice? It's almost mocking that movie. You know, a lot of people have disputed that supersize me guys claims I know a lot of interesting. Um, I want an, you know, I, I would have thought that there's no way. Like he wouldn't be bullshitting. Like the, there's the results wouldn't be that bad. I mean it seems similar or would definitely be that bad.

Speaker 3:          01:09:45       But then I watched a show, Marie had that show 30 days. Yeah. It was kind of, I saw some fuckery in that show. No, I felt bullshit when I was watching the documentary. Like what he threw up very early in the film. I don't know if you remember, you were studying it to build. Yeah. Yeah. I, you know, I never really thought of it, if any of the show being fake because I actually watched all of his shows like the 30 day shows and I actually enjoy all of them. I never really looked at him like, oh, this is fake. No, I know. I know. One of them is fake and this is how I know it. He, he did one on hormone replacement therapy and he used, while he tried to use a doctor that I know and the doctor said, there's no way I would ever do that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:20       He goes, do you're asking for something completely unethical? He goes, if a guy wants to get on hormone replacement therapy, first of all, why would he want to do that in his thirties he guys like 33 years old in this television show and he goes, and second of all, you don't do it in 30 days. He goes, he, he wouldn't even start it from months like before you do anything where you give the guy hormones, you got to figure out a way how to optimize his own body's production of hormones. That's the most, the only way to do it, but I'm sure there's doctors that would do it. You know Hollywood doctors. I know how the doctor that does not listening to me, but the reason why it's bullshit is because the only types of doctors that were willing to do what he was asking them to do, we're completely unethical. So they made these conclusions on the show about what replacing your hormones are all about. Completely based on unethical doctors willing to fit within their production schedule. That's an unethical show. That's a show. That's bullshit. Because

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       the dot. Yeah, exactly what you're saying. The doctor who did it is fueling lies to me to be on TV, to get more,

Speaker 2:          01:11:19       and you're spewing lies in order to produce a show. Then the parameters of your 30 day time limit, it's stupid. I watched it. I was gone. No doctor would just give you testosterone. They don't look at your test levels and say, oh, your levels are low. Uh, you're 35 years old. What's going on? Do you sleep? They would start looking at you. You're fat. First of all, you've got to get all this shit out of your body. Okay, what are you eating? Okay, stop eating that. Starting this. You need to eat spinach. Do drink water. Oh, they would be crazy to do that. You're going to break the guy's system. You would never do that. And so in the show, the guy that gets angry and starts fucking throat, well there's somebody just shot him up with testosterone. I'm like, he doesn't know what the fuck is going on. This is not a balanced that in his body. And he doesn't even know.

Speaker 5:          01:12:00       I remember watching that. I mean, I dunno if he could be a good guy. I mean Nice Guy, you know, whatever. With music, I started watching like watching the movie, like some Mcdonald's is bad for you. That's the, that's the takeaway from this film. I mean, that's why I like the Pepsi Spice thing. It's like no shit. If you just live on mcdonalds, you'll vote on Pepsi spice. You're going to fucking, exactly. It's, you're not supposed to be something that you live on every month. I don't think the President Mcdonald would say eat at every meal every day for it.

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       30. But the, uh, the, the idea that his whole life, he was like ready to die because of it. Man. I'm not buying that.

Speaker 5:          01:12:31       No. Well, I was, a friend of mine was like, I was going to go see the movie and he's like, no, that's bullshit. I said, well how do you know? He's like, cause I was, I lived in this apartment once and my dad had a job out of nowhere and I didn't have a car. So I had to live right by Mcdonald's and I ate McDonald's every meal every day for like 60 days, and I'm here to talk about it because of what the fuck are you talking?

Speaker 2:          01:12:50       Yeah. Okay. There's, there actually is quite a bit of criticism

Speaker 5:          01:12:54       of that online of the, that movie. Yeah. Oh, I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       Yeah. Supersize me is not the scathing and factual indictment of the fast food industry that Morgan Spurlock wants it to be. Yeah. There's a, there's quite a few people that, that looked at this and said that this doesn't, doesn't align up sponsored by Mcdonald's. Yeah. Look, it's interesting, you know, it's always interesting when you find out how little nutrition is in

Speaker 5:          01:13:17       positives. If it gets the word out, the fat, you shouldn't eat a lot of fast food. That's a good thing. But you don't want it to do it through. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       Bullshit. We have a real sickness in the society where we, we need fast food. You know, when you're in your car, I fucking, he was pulling and grab a burger real quick. Like, I mean it's nice that you can do that. But man, we need to figure out a way to fucking relax a little. You know, the, the older I get, especially when I'm running around, I need to get a coffee. I gotta be here on time. Do I really need to be there on time? Do I really need to get a cup of coffee? What I really need to do is not be, it's fucking busy like this, this craziness of being stuck in traffic and not being able to get home for two hours. So you pull into in and out Burger, whatever we all really need to do is figure out a way to never be in fucking traffic for two hours every day of the week. Cause that's craziness. And that's a big part of everybody's reality. And if that's your reality, then it's also possible that your reality is cheeseburgers that grab a quick meal, coffee

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       in the morning because you're fucking sleeping. You know, you got to throw down a 20 ounce coffee on the way to work just to wake the fuck up that damned espresso machine I was telling you about that my parents got me. That's ruining my life. My wife got me one for Christmas a couple years ago. I use it more than anything anybody's ever bought me ever except this game of Thrones box

Speaker 5:          01:14:30       your luck. It's bad ass. That's really cool. Sorry. It's pretty, you're a bed show box show up yet.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       Not yet. It will be there. So what's that? Um, not season two. It's all the calm. They scraped off from that show. Girls put her in a mayonnaise jar. It's imagine if you saved all your com. Has anyone ever done that from the time they were like a young man tough today? Like no, it's mine. Just have a jug by the bed. He Jack off into it

Speaker 5:          01:15:00       cause I, I, I've done that and that weird that I'm here. I've done it for a couple of weeks. It's a kid a couple of weeks. Yeah. Where you would to like have like a mountain dew can not when you're a kid you'd just like to throw it in. By the way, are you not joking now when I was younger, when I was younger, like when I'm saying 38 something like that, like I remember you and you're fine with this on iTunes and Ustream long as it doesn't get on stitcher and other thing. Is that what was even grocer is that I even have a bit about how I used to fuck pillows and I would fuck my pillows all the time and then my mom would have to take my pillowcases off and I just remember looking at my pillow cases like, man that looks so gross. It's just like covered yellow and it's gotten hard.

Speaker 5:          01:15:39       My housekeeper found one of my old tee shirts wants that wasn't a fun conversation. What did she say to you? Yes. She's like, I know she, she just cleaned it. She was like, here's your shirt. I was like, I don't want to wear the shirts. Good to me. That's it. You're scared. He's scared of the loads. Know, but that's not a shirt you wear to high school. I always thought it'd be a funny thing if like you're in a hurry in the morning and you just grabbed a shirt real fast and you get to school and realize it's your comrade. You have to, where are we playing games?

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       Jerk off. We're pretending he doesn't jerk off. We all jerk off. You might as well go to school with a fucking load stained shirt. Who Cares?

Speaker 5:          01:16:20       I think I might have one on right now. That's a new cool thing. I'm going to come on this house Rogan shirt and bring it back tomorrow. I don't give a shit. We should wear each other's shirts.

Speaker 1:          01:16:32       Fuck you man. He just creeped me out. You're wearing a higher prime nature, by the way. Those who have been restocked higher prime at all of them had been restocked. Yeah. That's a dope one. Cool. Sure. Yeah. I got a tee shirt company. It's small. Mostly monkeys and psychedelics. That's the whole thing. I love to call higher primates, higher-primate.com not on the website. Yeah. Then you do real estate too, right? No, not anymore. Now I'm, I catered only to the gay community. That's somewhat something someone created, like the whole pamphlet about this kind of catering only to the gay community or they put it out online.

Speaker 5:          01:17:03       Jayda pull your new kicking ass on that pole. I think since we talked about the poll yesterday, you're, you're now up, oh, let's hold,

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       oh, Annie's the training MMA fighter.

Speaker 5:          01:17:13       Okay. Okay. Can I get your back on that for one second? Again, I don't like to kiss ass, but I saw that interview because I was listening to that one. But I also saw there was with the hands, but I was watching the clip that they were apparently who was somebody was pissed at you about that. I don't know. But you were very, you were almost like knew that the clip was going to get out on most and you were like very politically correct. And what you said in a weird way, like you don't forget, you said transgender. Even like there's nothing controversial about what you said. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:17:41       I'm not, you know, I'm not an insensitive person. You know, even though I'm a comedian, when I'm talking seriously about a subject, if I was on stage, I might say tranny, but I don't want to be disrespectful to what someone's choices. If I call you a tranny, I wish we were good enough friends. We could fuck it. Take it. Okay. I wish that I could call you a trainee and you would, uh, you would, you would laugh it off and just be happy to be who are,

Speaker 5:          01:18:05       but just the fact that you knew to say, cause I'm learning this on comedy central through standards and practices, what you're supposed to say and that suppose not trying to say training, but I was impressed. He said transgender and all you said was that, uh, they shouldn't be this woman. You even called her a woman shouldn't be allowed to fight or this, this, no, you called her woman. You said she, she shouldn't be allowed to fight men. That's not fair. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:18:30       no, she shouldn't be allowed to fight. We'll fight women. Yeah, I'm sorry. And by the way, she fought women without disclosing the fact that she used again. So that's lying. And there's doctors that are saying, this is something that we talked about this yesterday, but just in the, you know, the possibility that no one heard that or people listening, some of you haven't heard that there's a mechanical advantages to being a man that are absolutely undeniable. The size of the hands, the, the width of the shoulders, the, the fact that you've had testosterone freely flowing through your body for 30 years. 30 years. Yes. When you go on hormone replacement therapy and take estrogen, you lose bone mass. You, you most certainly lose some muscle mass. You definitely change physiologically and become closer to a woman, but it's not a woman. And people will say, well, what about a woman who's just naturally strong? What about like a Serena Williams, like a super athlete woman? Okay, that is who she is. We're not talking about allowing someone to go from the most vicious and powerful sex, the mail sacks and compete in a violent sport against the softer sex. There's an aberration people.

Speaker 5:          01:19:33       But what, but what year, just to clear it up, you were saying, you were saying nothing about the transgender community. You were not saying that this particular person should not be allowed to fight women fight

Speaker 2:          01:19:43       women. That's it. Even if it's a race, if it's a big game of basketball even we, we joked around about it. There's a 50 year old man, um, in um, California that's a, a transgender and has joined this college basketball team and is playing women's college basketball as a six foot six, 220 pound man. He's enormous. That's insane. It is insane. But I don't have a problem with, no one's getting hurt as long as he doesn't start like hard fouling or bullying people or something like that and using his size and it seems like they all like him. I don't have a problem with it. If it was my daughter and she got hurt playing with him cause he knocked her over, I might be like, hey man, that's kind of fucked up or something along those lines. But for the most part I think in non contact sports it's probably, you know, I mean I think the Olympic should probably have a standard, I don't know what it is. If they've even figured it out yet. I think they do. I think they do have it. I think it's two years. You have to have two years of hormone replacement. But I do not think that that should apply to violent combat sports. I just don't, what if, if like Rhonda Rousey was like, look, I want to fight this trigger. You know what, which drainage or transgender women or I don't even know what I mean. Yeah. That's his safe words. And I say, do you think, do you think she should be out?

Speaker 2:          01:21:04       Shit, shit should be, should that be allowed though? Like if Ron, Ron, first of all, Ronda Rousey is obviously, if you're looking at the spectrum of powerful female, she's at the very top of the spectrum. She's a world champion woman's cage fighter, you know, she is a fucking legit certified Badass. So this guy that became a woman was never as skilled as Ronda Rousey when he was a man. And the, the strength and the skill that Ronda Rousey has, I'm pretty sure she'd be able to overcome some, uh, transgender average person. But you know what, if you found out that Ronda Rousey used to be a man and that's why she was so bad ass and flipping people around this transgender has knocked three women brutally unconscious in cage fights that did not know that she used to be a man and she's stopping them like inside of 30 seconds.

Speaker 2:          01:21:58       Okay, that I've watched the fight. That is not the way a woman moves. That's the way a man moves. I'm watching the way she's beating up on these people. The mechanical advantage is still there. If you look at her, her fucking shoulders are wide. Her. The deception is a part of it because you should be able to say who you are. That's a thing. This is that there's a real problem in the transgender community and in the super progressive community that supports transgenders. They don't believe you should even have to disclose that used to be a transgender. When you attain it, they don't think that you should be able to just, you have to disclose it for work. They don't think you should have to disclose it for competition. And I say bullshit because it's not a woman. You're saying it's a woman because they've changed into a woman and they're injecting woman's hormones into it.

Speaker 2:          01:22:43       But if you look at them chromosomally that is an x, y chromosome. That's a man. If, if you talk to them individually, they, for the most part, they don't like my brother's gay and knows a lot of transgenders who he calls trainees, but I'm not allowed to say training because I'm not gay because they know because it was, yeah, exactly. But it suck a cock just so he could say, yeah, I should unclos talking brothers Cock and then you're done. Listen, to be honest with you. Exactly. How do you know? You don't know my or my mouth has been, but like every transgender who I've met through my brother, totally cool. They always joke about they, they say trainee, you know, they say like, ah, it used to be, it's a joke, right? I guarantee you all these people I'm talking about wouldn't give a shit about what you're saying is a lot of the people that are getting super upset or not even transgenders, that that's what I'm saying.

Speaker 2:          01:23:30       We're more more of those angers. I don't think the anger is coming from Huc community. There's this weird left wing anger thing going on. You know? That is where people think that if you're not progressive and you disagree with them in some way, that it's cool to call you an asshole or a caveman or a piece of shit or whatever, and I haven't taken a lot of this on Twitter. It's hilarious from people where I have been nothing but supportive of everything except of man who used to be a man fighting women. That's what I'm supporting you. That's you. Because you went out of your way to just say this specific person and you ain't, she even called her a woman. Yeah. Well she's not a woman, but if she wants to be a woman, I'm cool with that. If you want to be a her, that's cool.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       You are a transgender. That's what you are and you're a transgender woman and I am totally okay with whatever you want to do for a living, whatever you want to call yourself. I'm okay with all of that. As long as you can't beat up women because I really don't think that it's fair. So why wouldn't women's groups come to your aid and say we don't want, I think this is a relatively new issue. First of all, this is a relatively new issue, but Misha Tate, who's a high level women's MMA fighter has already said she's going to be the coaches on the next ultimate fighter. She just said she would never fight this check. And she just said, you know, she wants to, she would need to hear more about genetics and test or a body composition and testing. I have, you know, like on that same token, like I have gay friends who like hate, glad, they're like, they're just taking, they're put in to making us sound like we're proved and stuck.

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       I think they just take it too far. So like, it's like, you know, just everyone needs to come to, well this, this, there's this thing in the progressive community where they're really aggressive and shitty with people that has an opposing opinion and they like immediate, like one of the, like I've had disagreements with people, uh, about rules and regulations regarding cage fighting about decisions for cage fights and have many more people be way more polite about their disagreements or I felt that he won because of this reason. But Hey, thanks for the, uh, the forum to discuss this are people pretty fucking cool and rational, but it comes cage fighting fans. But people that are upset with me that disagree with me about this trainee thing universally have been insulting almost universally. And I looked at how many tweets you think you've gotten about it?

Speaker 2:          01:25:43       Hundreds. Hundreds. Just, I don't know. No, no, no. Put it away. I don't even care. But if this has been less than how long? Um, I dunno. Well, we, the David Lee Roth thing was last week, but less than a week. Yeah. Well, whatever it is. Um, it's, it's interesting that so many people who consider themselves sensitive left wing are also like really quick to insult you for no fucking reason. Like really quick. Even if you, and even when I've responded to them without insults, you get more back, asshole shit had Dick Wad just over and over and over again. You fucking insensitive pig. You know, like,

Speaker 5:          01:26:23       like I'm an honorary. I'd be the first to tell you if I thought you were being insensitive or if like if you were saying shit about, you know, certain know I would say, I would say I wouldn't bullshit you if you, if I thought you were making fun of gay people or transgenders or whatever it is, but that was not what you were doing. That's what I'm sticking up for you.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       Well thank you. But that's sort of my point. My point is that there's a bunch of people in this society that aren't really outraged. What they're doing is choosing to be outraged and they're outraged about a lot of shit. They're outraged about the state of their own life. They're outraged about the progress they have in their career, their, their romance there, whatever the fuck it is, their weight loss program, they're outraged about a lot of shit and when something comes along where they have the green light to be upset about things, then they feel like it's on Twitter waiting to get upset and they feel like it's cool to like lash out. It's cool. It's cool to like let, I'm taking a stand, fuck this and fuck that and fuck you. And whoa. Like we're just talking about a guy who gets an operation and now is allowed to beat the fuck out of girls.

Speaker 2:          01:27:27       And I'm just saying that I know a lot about beating the fuck out of people. I'm a professional cage fighting commentary. I've been involved in martial arts my entire life and I know a lot of trainees and I know trainees that look like girls. I met a trainee once, she was tiny, she weighed like a hundred pounds and you, you would never know that this was a, this was a girl or it wasn't a girl. This was born a guy and I made that mistake a couple of times. I've had it happen a bunch of times. We had one on the man show, she called herself vanity and she was a beautiful man. Really, really pretty. And she also had a dick that looked like a plays and monkey cock. It was like black and it was like she was slowly poisoning it by feeding an estrogen tastes the same.

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       I don't know. I didn't even, I was drunk at the time. The um, this woman, what we had, we did, we had this show called, this is one of the things about working for comedy central. I'm sure your experience is probably more positive than ours because we were coming in sort of to a preexisting show. Yeah. And they had a lot of ideas about what it shouldn't, shouldn't be. One of the things was we had a show called make previous regime. Yeah. Those fucks, they're done. They're done yet dead. The, um, we had a show called make me hard and make me hard was we would put a, like a box onto your cock that was supposed to like recognize when you've got a boner and there was a light bulb on it and light bulb would flash red whenever your dick out heart. So we would have things like major seat and bananas. Of course you dick would get hard and just really ridiculous shit. So we had this woman who was, yeah, she was in a bikini and I'm telling you, there's no way you would not know that

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       she was born a man. She hot as fuck. If you were stuck on a deserted island with her, you wouldn't even care that much as long as she kept her pants. Dot. Yeah, she's preop. Okay. So she's, uh, she's on top of this guy and she's pouring whipped cream all over her enhanced breasts, which looked amazing. Um, the guys suck in the whip cream off of her, her breasts. Everyone's going fucking crazy. Then she pulls her fake or pulls her pants down to reveal her poison. Dick is withered. Bonobo. Monkey. Dick looks like mine. And of course then the, the light starts flashing like crazy. The guy's Dick a hard as a rock and the audience let out the one of the most tangible moans I've ever heard, like one of the most like visceral, like down to your DNA, Moen. It was like as soon as the, the, the cock came out, I was like, oh. It was just like thinking about the fact that this guy just been sucking on this girl's tits, whipping know whip cream, sucking lip cream. I for tents like seconds ago, all the way. By the way, he's tied up. He can't move his boxes on his cock.

Speaker 5:          01:30:08       It's crazy. It's crazy. Cause I might, my show, they have to, is it up there? No, we're not talking to you that they, they, we did audience testing of our show and one of the first bits I did on my show was my buddy Brian, who's gay. I get you. You're not as bad as other Brian's in the world. You fuck. Yeah, exactly. You're my buddy now. But he was my buddy still. He, uh, he's gay. So we this, that APP Grindr where you meet guys, uh, you know the APP. Grindr. Yeah. So I get on Grindr. I tried to get him late through the APP. Right. So we send that the show, the audience test. This is what I heard cause I'd never saw the results. It's like once the audience saw that scene, they were done. Like they will not watch this show. Like they just, they thought the whole show was like, it almost made me not go to air because the lights just like this is a gay show in that crazy to think that like, like they couldn't, what happened?

Speaker 5:          01:30:58       What I, what I heard was that the, you know, people stopped, you know, they, they move the meters and I'll let shit, people just tune like they're done. Like there was funny stuff after I thought that piece is really funny, which is actually airing. Wow. It's going to air. It is. So I give him credit for airing it, but they just stay too. They're just like, this is gay and I don't want the testing people to think I'm gay, so I'm not going to say I liked this show. It's not even, it wasn't even, you know, just

Speaker 1:          01:31:22       me trying to get my buddy let you, first of all, you have to think who's testing the show. Those are the people that don't have jobs that they pay to sit down and watch these things. And a lot of those people are crazy. I give credit to the network for ignoring that data. Yeah. That just cool of them to say, listen, these guys didn't like the show cause they thought it was, there's a gay scenes of buckets. I think one of the things that we've learned is that there's only one way for a unique vision to get on to television, whether it's or in any form, whether it's a movie or, I mean it's gotta be this one person's idea. Ben Hoffman, what do you think is funny? Go with it. And if you're good and if you, you understand boundaries

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       and if you understand how to display something that might be controversial and allow people to sort of see where you're coming from, they'll accept it or enough people will accept it and then also they'll gravitate towards it. They'll go, hey, this Ben Hoffman, this guy's for real, his shows.

Speaker 5:          01:32:15       I appreciate that. That was the whole vision of the show, which is people always ask me like, how'd you get this show on the, it's crazy you got this fucking thing on the or how would you do it? And I'm not making this up when I say this, the goal of the pilot, because I was getting a lot of starting to get more writing gigs and I wanted to get better, right. And Gates, so I decided I'm going to make a pilot. That's just to get me better. Right. I'm saying this to be completely honesty. I don't want the show to get picked up. That was my mode of thinking. I go, I want to make the most of the craziest pilot ever that people will see in the industry and say, who the fuck is it? I gotta meet this guy, we can't air, this is unairable.

Speaker 5:          01:32:48       But I got that note at one point. This is an Arab oil and it was, it was, it was not like, it was not for air, just going to be totally me. So instead of having to send writing samples, I could send this comedy central pilot out to people and then he'd make me seem more legit than I get a call. Like, Oh shit man, you're not gonna believe this. They fucking love the Bible is that they need, which is great. But at the time it was not even a goal of mine, which is almost the best way to do it, which is I'm just, I'm not going to listen to fucking anything there. I, you know, can't as it got, you know, guy running things over there and he's really into an individual voices, which is, I'm hoping that's why I'm hoping the show were.

Speaker 5:          01:33:23       And there's a lot of that stuff going on over there. And I again, I Kent Alterman, he's been fucking great. He's like, do your thing. He gives me notes that make the show and I'm not saying this cause that's, cause he's not little, he's probably not listening, although hopefully someone will give this to him. Um, he's given me notes that makes the show more me, you know, so he's going through the thing. So it's, it's, I was, I'm really in a, I'm hoping people watch the show obviously, so I can keep doing it, but I'm really in a rare place where I can do the exact, there is nothing I've done on the show they don't want to do.

Speaker 2:          01:33:55       That's perfect. That's the only way to do a show, right. Wants to get you think you're talented

Speaker 5:          01:33:59       and then support you. The problem. The only downside is when like these Twitter things and that it's extra per, it's I gotta I have to ignore it of course. But they really are insulting you. Like if you've gone when you go on stage and do your standup and they had people don't like it. It's harder for different than you because people are coming in, they're paying Mital cause they liked your show. But if you put yourself out there like on your like standup specials you've done and people don't like it, they are insulting you as a person. It's like when, if they insult my show, they're insulting me. Like my, my actual dad's on the show, you know. But that's good. I love it. I mean it took me a couple of weeks to get used to it. I'm not going to lie to read that Shit and get used to personal cause it, all this stuff I'd done was like, I was part of a show or writing on a show, producing show being having a small part in a show. So to have my name in the show and have you don't think about the time cause there's no live studio audience, but to do a show, you know, kind of with my friends and kind of on my own, do my own, put myself up, you know, you know, out there for everyone to see without again, without a live audience, you just don't know. And then it like month, a couple months later dare. It's like, wait a second, I really fucking put myself out there

Speaker 2:          01:35:05       to do that though. Because that's the honest reaction. That's the people that aren't paid and some of them are going to be assholes, they're going to hate everything. But the other ones have good points and then be better.

Speaker 5:          01:35:12       Exactly. And also, but if if let's say a 60% of the people like it, that's still, it's plenty audience. Oh yeah. It's more than enough. He's more than plenty. 40% hate it. You can't make everybody happy. Exactly. What I've, I've learned that at the heart, right?

Speaker 2:          01:35:26       There's music that I love that I've talked about on this, on the podcast, and I'll get people fucking hate tweeting me that fucking pussy shit. One of my favorite bands, honey honey that we've had on the podcast a bunch of times, every time we have them on, I get a fucking hundred on the tween from a punch of people out there. They're just miserable.

Speaker 5:          01:35:45       And the crazy thing is these are people who listen to you, who just listened to your show and they want to just get, so their fans insulting one particular, there's always gonna be that. And especially because the

Speaker 2:          01:35:56       anonymity of the Internet and the fact that they can just interact with you through text on the screen. This, there's very little like reason to be kind. There's very little to,

Speaker 5:          01:36:06       it's weird. I saw one of your tweets the other day and it stuck with me. I was, cause I was reading like, you know, I got a separate in this shit I think. Although it's sometimes fun to read even insult, but your, what'd you say? You saw Oz, the wizard of Oz, the new eyes, blue eyes. And you're like got bad reviews. Just a reminder that uh, most critics are said cons. Isn't that weird?

Speaker 2:          01:36:28       You said something like that. It just reinforced my notion, my belief that most critics are sad. That makes me feel bad. Like that tweet calm me down for about 30 to 35 seconds. The reality is most people are critics who are critics because they don't have anything to contribute. They're not artists. They wanted to be artists. Almost every critic wanted to be something artistic, whether it's a writer or whether it's they want to do screenplays are novels and in fact some of them have and failed. They're not the right people for the job. The only right people for the job or regular people. Not yet.

Speaker 5:          01:37:00       We get paid well and don't get me wrong, I wasn't making like when an Asian woman crosses a street and you hear me see me hit a gong, like I wasn't going. This is critics gold man. This is like when people are going to be funny. All I'm, the whole point of show is just calming. It's all it is.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       W we do that in stand up and we do that. And you know, on a podcast you don't, you're not always saying things because it's supposed to be the most brilliant thing ever. He just, you know what the funny thing to say is, you know what the funny thing to do is?

Speaker 5:          01:37:26       Yeah. I mean this is, I like these kind of like von, these kinds of podcasts where I don't have to be funny all the time. Again, I'm, I'm, I'm not going to dead if that's the case. But you know, like when you have time, you want to make a show, you just want it to be funny. You're not thinking about like, well, this reached the artistic, it's just like fucking be fun

Speaker 2:          01:37:42       playing to the back of the room like that. A super dangerous, that's like some UCB shit where you see comics that will survive there, but they go anywhere else and they eat a fat, played a decks. The reason why is because you're trying to be this like, you know, really eccentric playing to the back of the room inside joke, you know, very verbose, you know, very articulate. You're trying to appeal to the critics. You're trying,

Speaker 5:          01:38:05       well, I think I've noticed that recently to meet the death of comedy is cool. Yeah. People trying to be cool. It's killing comic and that's just so much of that shit nowadays. It's like those cool indie bands, you know, these cool indie car. There's just so much coolness trying to be cool. There are certain people that are just cool and it's just who they are. Like, you know, Chris Rock is cool, right? What are you going to do about it? Exactly. But he Chappelle's cool. He's a cool guy, but he knows how to bring con. I'm not saying you can't be cool. I'm just saying can try to be cool. That's, that's what the, the, these people are worried about making an ass out of themselves. Right. They're getting in the way of their comedy by trying to be cool. Well, there's that thing too where they show some cool

Speaker 2:          01:38:47       does that thing too where they criticized physical comedy and they criticize anybody who tries too hard or they criticize anybody who's animated on stage. Like, oh, he's one of those comics. And you're like, what an entertainer. But someone's actually, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:38:59       I was watching Jim Carrey on this interview the other day and he was this inside comedy show on showtime is actually pretty good. And he was talking about how like ace Ventura came out and like have, obviously it's not the critics. Critics don't go, hey, go see ace Ventura. But he gets, he got calls from Steve Martin and all his favorite comics were coming up to him and telling him like other comics were saying, God, this movie is brilliant. And he was like, I can, who gives a fuck about what that critic, you know Steve Martin called me on my phone. Like my favorite comedian called me and said, he called, you know what he's saying? You have to talk. I was, I'm carrying Jim Carrey right now. Jesus Christ. Brian, no cheap. Martin didn't call me, but it would be called people tuned in. Right? You just woke up. See Martin called you. Who are you? That's what happens. You fucking playing solitaire over there. You're following whatever. But now I take it personally. Maybe I'm being so fucking boring.

Speaker 2:          01:39:45       Listen man, you're not going to your art, whatever it is, whether it's a TV show or a stand up comedy act, it's a work in progress. It's always, you're always improving it and you're constantly getting better and part of the input is criticism, whether it's a positive or negative, the input of the audience, whether it's laughter or people sending you a text message. Just saying racism hurts you the most though. Is there any that hurts you at this point or no? It shouldn't hurt you. If it hurts me, I'm telling you what hurts me is when they're right. That's what hurts me. Yeah. If I, if I did something where I knew it was lazy or I did something where it half assed it, if you tell me something sucked and I'm like, okay, you say it. Sorry, I just heard a thousand people laugh their asses off and they enjoyed it and I liked that kind of comedy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:27       The okay, that's how fine. You know, you could say it sucks. This is not your style. I know what I'm doing. I know my style, I know what I enjoyed doing. What? What would bother me and what has in the past is when someone would say something and I knew that they were right. You know, I hadn't been working hard enough at something or it was lazy or the bit was, you know, it was a cheap ending to the bid or whatever, something like that. So, but those have been super important over the years. Like that negative criticism oftentimes helps you more than anything.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       That's interesting. I never thought about it like that because that I'll bet there are some that really stung and got me really pissed because they were probably going to stand up. Do you do, I don't do standup.

Speaker 2:          01:41:03       Okay. That's the thing you see when you're doing stand up, you're constantly getting reactions from the crowd. You're constantly getting in plenty. I did a lot of, you know I did sketch all the time so I was, you know, I've been in front of those non laughing audiences. So that's just an important, similar, the difference being of course, that when you're standing up, you're completely on your own up there and you've got nothing to talk about other than what's inside your head and trying to relay these ideas to the audience. And some people can do it and some people can't. Some people can do it some days and can't do it the other days and wouldn't, especially when you start out, there's a long process from the time you first started out to the time when you're like a legit headline or a 10 years plus. And along the way you have to bomb you literally, there's no way to do it right. Every time you're going to fuck up, you're going to be insecure. You're going to get in a fight with your girlfriend and you're going to fucking have a bill that you have to pay that's on your mind. He's going to be a lot of shit and you're going to have to learn how to navigate and negotiate every one of those particular situations.

Speaker 5:          01:41:59       Yeah, I mean that's kind of why I didn't get into state and I just, cause I just, I just knew, first of all, I didn't want, it's not what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to do TV, so I didn't want to be one of those guys who did stand up to try to get something else out of it. But like I just knew I wouldn't be good at, you know, it wasn't my thing. So that's why he started. You don't do it in the writing and all that. I wanted to work my way into TV, although my, my TV is kind of, you know, that's my standup, which is me putting myself out there.

Speaker 2:          01:42:25       Well there's a lot of people that have become like sort of Internet stand, you know, like they do like youtube videos and shit and they like, they'll have like a million hits on them and you'll find it and, and they're just a funny guy who's got to take on something going to the movies or this or that. And I think you don't need to only do it live in front of an audience with a microphone. It's just, that's what I like. That's my, I enjoy it. But I could totally see a bunch of different outlets for kind of the same thing. It's like what is, what is your point of view? What is your or your, your way to create a product, whether it's a video or an audio clip, whatever it is that you think is good.

Speaker 5:          01:43:02       I just, I, when I, when people ask me to do live stuff, I just do it. This one bit that I have from my show life and that's, I went until standup Saturday. Like I forgot how fun it is to watch like funny standup. It's fucking great. I just go very rarely. I mean my favorite, uh, I don't know that I've ever laughed harder than watching norm macdonald do standup. He's, he's, he's, he's my favorite standup to watch prior to finally guy, awesome guys and new podcast to with Adam from Tempe Improv. Oh, it doesn't really? Yeah. Oh, that's great man. He wants to come on the show. I think he's on the bench. Oh, by the way. Um, and uh, but just watching, just knowing I can't do or let go as a kid watching Richard Pryor movies, like I can never fucking do that. You could do that. Yeah. That's

Speaker 2:          01:43:44       not true. It's just a matter of time, you know? But I asked Richard Pryor wasn't good when he started out either. I, nobody was, you start out and you

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       still figure it out. Yeah. You know, it's like anything else. Like what do you choose? I'm happy where I am, so don't, I don't want people to think like I'm bitching and moaning. I don't think anybody does. Well, I kind of do. Do you? Yeah. The thing about you receiving feedback though from the audience, it's just you don't, you're not getting that feedback every weekend in a club, you know? So when you're doing it, you're putting together your editing it and boom, throwing it out there and then you get the feedback. So it's more of a slow reaction to the work you're getting any, but you get it all at once. You get that night and then it kind of slows down and every Thursday night I get, we need all saw a new guy to the new guy thing. It's like, who's this fucking new guy?

Speaker 3:          01:44:33       Yeah. And I've noticed that over the, even over three weeks I've watched it dissipate, which is very good sign for me. I've watched it like the haters leave. They don't watch every week. They were just like, you interrupted my fucking favorite show with your dumb shit. I hate you. They go laid and the new then the people who like it sticker. I just, even even me, it's hard for me to get used to a new show, you know, in a new guy. It's hard. Yeah. It's um, it's, it's really hard to get into new shows. There's not that there's, there's a better selection of shows to watch now though, that I think I've ever been before. And also is that there's a new show after mine called Nathan for you starting Nathan fielder, which is another really funny show. Same kind of thing. He's just being himself and uh, we're both kind of in the same boat, which is a new night, you know, new faces, new comedian.

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       What's it called? Nathan. Nathan for you. It's really funny you for you. He takes, he takes on to small businesses and gives them business advice that he kind of doesn't know what he's doing. It's really, yeah, you should, we should watch it. It's really good. So his name is, last name is Nathan fielder fielder. Yeah. So me and him have are, are, you know, I'm at 10, he's a 10 30 Thursday. So it's Kinda this new night of comedy for comedy central have to unknown guys. So it's a slow build but they're bringing back the cause. I think that it's so important to have new faces. I think it's so important to new ideas and new like, like your show, like the, I love the idea of the hybrid between a reality show and like strip mugshot shit. But funny, like that clip was great. I'm really looking forward to watching your show now because of that one clip.

Speaker 3:          01:46:03       Like, that's like, well, you, you, you, you, you showed a cliff, you tweeted a clip about my, I don't even know if you knew it was my show. That last text ad thing. Didn't you tweet that? Uh, the wheelchair tweeting, talking about, uh, the last texts he ever sent. Did you send that at least not the titties? Yes. That was my, that's for my show. I know. So you're watching it. You don't even know you're watching it. That's good. Um, yeah. So you're a good sign. Yeah. So people are watching it and tweeting about, and they don't even know my name. That's awesome man. Yeah, that's really cool. Including Joe Rogan. Well, it's beginning, you know, I mean that's, everybody starts from a beginning point and you're, you're, you're off to the races. So I'm psyched about it. But I think it's cool that comedy central is trying like new ideas and taking new chances like that for what the new regime, it's, yeah. It's like a lot of the same guys over and over again and were getting like a lot of stale

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       shit,

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       you know? Yeah. I mean, I, you know that old regime, but I didn't know anybody, those people, but

Speaker 2:          01:46:54       this is how bad it was. You know the show make me hard that I told you about it. Yeah. They wouldn't let us use the word hard. The argument was it's too mean or too vulgar. Let's make it make me Steph. And I go, are you fucking serious? I go, are we really having this conversation? You're really telling me that make me, Steph is less offensive than make me hard. You would like us to change the sign. Yes. That's how we feel. Women. Nutty. Crazy fucks. This is post nine 11 boners right though it was. That was even before the Janet Jackson thing. The Janet Jackson thing happened in the middle of Doug and I do in the Manchild. Oh, that was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. I thought that was going to have no effect. I was like, why would anybody give him a Fox?

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       She pulls her tit out in the Superbowl, whatever. But meanwhile, these people were scrambling. We showed up on the set on Monday and they, we had to have a special meeting where they killed like half of our fucking monologues, half of our thousand crazy time. Just cause you know, it was a bunch of weasels who were worried about losing their jobs. So they start scrambling to appease the world and then the advertiser going, what is the way the people, the American people are outraged at television. Oh, we're going to show off and everything up. Well, I want to keep my job and I want to keep my nice house and I want to buy a boat. So we're going to polish it up and we're gonna, we're gonna give the American people what they bought. What do they want them on? No tests, no tests, no tests. So we had the man show and we had all these nutty fucking sketches that we wanted to do. I was craziness and naked people and shit. No, no, no, no, no. They started, they started to hacking at it. Everything controversial.

Speaker 5:          01:48:31       That's crazy. I remember at that Lou Reed, while walk on the wild side, they edited that song for radio after the Janet Jackson thing. That song been airing for 30 for 30 years on the radio. God took out a line from that song on the radio and Lou Reed fucking flipped the line. There's a line, it's slipped in there that that's something about something giving head. Yeah, and it was his given head. It's never, it had never been given head. Hey Babe, take a while. And He'd been erring on the radio on regular rock stations. Perfectly fine for 30 years after Janet Jackson's Boob. They edit it.

Speaker 2:          01:49:08       Yeah, there's a crazy, there's a weird clamp down in this, this world today. And I think part of it has to be attributed to the fact that people know that the world is insane and the, the more they can sort of tighten things down and regulate and stop and no assault guns and no drugs and no swearing and know and the more like control that they can have over over people, what they do, what they say or what, what sort of ideology gets broadcast. The more they can do that, the better because then it allows them to believe somehow or another, they've got at least a small hold on this fucking craziness

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       that's in front of them, which is the human species right now. I mean, you look at the Internet and you see what the fuck people are really all about. Yeah. Trust me, I've been there. It's loads and head's getting cut off and car accidents and fucking lion attacks. That's the Internet. Goddamn, it's 30% porn. My first buddy you've got got the, got the Internet. I remember going and he's like, dude, the first thing I saw in there, just look at this a guy's head inside a vagina. Yeah. I'm like, dude, I don't know what the Internet is, but I'm already on board. I like this. I like where this, where this business going. I want stock. Yeah. You can find out a lot of things that are possible that you would like. There's no way. Come on. Porn, uh, represents 30% of the Internet. I find that that even sounds a little bit small, but that's a lot.

Speaker 3:          01:50:32       No, someone gave me a list. Someone gave me a list of the uh, the top I think it was, and we were doing, trying to figure out marketing or something for the show and the list of the top websites in the world. It was the craziest, I knew everyone. It was like, I'm not even kidding. 12 of the 20, it was like porn hub and then be like five down cnn.com it was like, like stuff that I found out about later, like x hamster. If you ever heard of x Hammes yes. X Hamster was like number three or something and like, you know, a Google was below, like it was insane. The real porn or the real internet, that's where the real money is quite charging the have the internet. If you think about it is more, I mean 30% is like a weird number, but if you stop and think about what it really means, it's almost a third 3% I still think that's a conservative number, but even, let's say it is a third, he said you really do one at a three.

Speaker 3:          01:51:25       I think it's higher than that. Most Internet traffic, more than one a three is porn just from the numbers I've seen before, but I'm saying, yeah, for me it's 90 but you, but you know you're wrong, but something wrong with you. Of course. I know I've got, I've got issues man. But you know that you don't represent most people? No, I think I see. I think because I'm open about it, I'm probably not as, I'm probably not as dark as the most people. Most people, it's probably 98 comedians are one of the few that are allowed to talk freely about beating off without fear of losing our jobs to that's true, but let's say, let's see, let's say it is, it is a third. You're not even, that's crazy to think that one third of the time spent on the Internet is looking at porn.

Speaker 3:          01:52:02       Yeah, that's insane. That I think it is a third. I think a third is probably pretty well the or 30% good if you think about it, that you have to use her so much for email or work stuff and there is a lot of regular stuff you have to do. So maybe that is right. I don't know. We were definitely entering tane entering into some weird area where people are trying to like slow down like free expression. I think. Oh, there's some debauchery out there, man. I mean I listened when you go on those porn sites and you hit the wrong button, which I've done many times or maybe maybe the right, but how's he going to say a lot of the night, some nights it's the right button hole. The man, if I seen some, like I didn't curse on that one. Yeah, I've seen crazy shit on, uh, uh, most of which, uh, you know, I'd rather not talk

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       about, but yeah, because, well, it led to masturbation. It's, it's interesting how, okay, if that's true, that's 30% of the Internet. Um, which let's assume that's true. And then those people who are watching this porn on this massive amounts of downloads and all this stuff, they're going to regular jobs where they have to be restricted. They're going to regular jobs with Amy the 30th right, but again, that's a lot. It's a lot. But the idea is that when they're at work or when they're interacting with people for the majority of the time, they have to suppress all of that. Like all of that is inside of their head, but the internet doesn't represent how you communicate in the corporate world. It doesn't communicate. It doesn't represent how you communicate in in your average everyday experience. You're like way more like conservative, way more buttoned down, way more like suppressed.

Speaker 2:          01:53:33       That's why I love comedy because not to go back to my show, but we do a bit on the show. We have a barbershop quartet countdown, the top internet porn videos of the week, so like you would come into our office and the writers and the prisoner all around just look watching porn to find the best titles. That's a job, right? We get paid for that. Just to look at, just to look at funny porn titles. I fucking love it. Yeah, it's a, there's, and there's some really fucking funny ones, man. We, we pull, we were talking about Annabella Chong yesterday, who was the first woman to do a, a gang bang. And she, uh, she actually, yeah, she actually did it because she was, um, she was a, uh, a woman's studies, uh, students, I believe at a USC. And she was, uh, trying to, uh, trying to figure out like, like what's, she wanted to be like a female stud, like the female version of a stud.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       So she fucked like 69 dudes and a in movies. But when you look at like this, it wasn't that many years ago. Uh, 95 at the age of 22, she became famous by engaging in 251 sex acts with 69 women are six 69 men rather over a 10 hour period with the resulting footage being promoted as the world's biggest gang. Bang, Huh? Yeah. But they're, the names of the titles were fucking hilarious. Um, yeah, no, we have some, my favorite was, um, my favorite one that we, of course, I don't know, he'd have to bleep it. It was chubby honey has a bushy pussy. Not chubby honey has a bush and hearing a barbershop quartet singing, it's pretty great. But just, I mean, you can't write anything funnier than that. Yeah. I'm trying to find her, uh, when I was in San Diego, this is what was on the TV at the Hoover tower room. Joe Ass factor. Oh No. Is that Eisa Assa probably as harsh. She takes it up the butter all the time. Yeah. They could probably go to jail for that. That you stealing fear factors thing. But that's a, they always, um, have really funny names. Like, here's one that she was in. Uh, Annabella [inaudible], sergeant pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Gang Bang.

Speaker 2:          01:55:40       I would watch that right now. Here's another one. What's a nice girl like you doing it? An anal

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       movie?

Speaker 5:          01:55:46       Legitimate question. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       Um, anal queen. I can't believe I did the whole team. Whoops. Yeah. When there was no gang bangs and I was a kid,

Speaker 7:          01:56:00       there's a really good porn I would recommend. It's called tonight's girlfriend and it's this guy that just like pays porn stars to be hookers for the night.

Speaker 1:          01:56:08       Wow. And he makes a video on it.

Speaker 7:          01:56:10       Yeah. That sounds a little bit like that Boogie nights scene a little bit where she'd stops in the limo on the side of the right on the street. Yeah. It's Kinda like, uh, like he makes some shower, uh, at the beginning of every thing really. What's it called? It's called, I believe it's called tonight's girlfriend. And the reason I like it is not that because of that, it's just filling the rather, he does a good job of filming it. So what do you like the way it's like the cinematography? Yeah. It's, I mean, some people just have better, I like good cinematography, so I'll check it out.

Speaker 1:          01:56:36       Yeah. Wow. And this guy a, is it a website?

Speaker 7:          01:56:40       I don't know if it's a website. I've just seen a few of the videos online.

Speaker 1:          01:56:44       So a lot of those girls will work as escorts. Right. Is that how it works?

Speaker 7:          01:56:48       I think he, he, I think the idea is that they're not really, they're playing escorts for the movie or at least most of them. But then if you think about that they're actually getting paid to have sex and they're actually being so kind of a prostitute. Anyone? Yeah. So kind of,

Speaker 1:          01:57:04       well, I read one girl saying that she was, I read an article about a, um, uh, a brothel, one of those Nevada brothels and there was a porn star started working at the brothel and her attitude was, well, porn is just sort of like a revolving brothel anyway. And I was like, Ooh, it's true. How is it not true? Yeah. And it was weird like listening to her talk about her attitude towards it. Like as long as she gets to go home to her man, she was fine. She was talking about that, like, so then the guy was asking me, well, do you do like weekend trips? Do we who do? Well, you'll do that. And she goes, well, it would have to be a ridiculous amount of money to keep me from my man. I was like, oh honey, I'm sorry. I got to go make a couple of couple of g's suck in some cock. But uh, when I come back, I'm going to buy a motorcycle.

Speaker 5:          01:57:49       I would take that deal with Jim. You say that now? I wouldn't, I would not be able to do that now. We had an escort on the show and I was asking her like, what the differences between escorting a prostitute in which you say, and she's like, nothing. Well, this escort that they blur out her face. No, we got to be showed her and she said, I'm, if I'm a, basically she goes, I'm just a prostitute. Wow. Differences a camera man. Yeah, yeah. She's allowing you to film that week. But we got it. But we got her number through legitimate sources. You know, it was like online legit prostitutes source. No, no escorts. Escorts are legit. Oh yes. We've got an escort. She comes over, says she's just like, yell, fuck you for whatever. She was attractive. I wet chatted with her, with my dad on the show, showed her to my dad. My Dad's like, you know, that's a very attractive. So you never met her in person, you just web? No, no, me and her are web web chat with my called my dad back in Kentucky. Oh, you were there right next

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       door and you called your dad? She was attractive and my dad even said as much and she was a prostitute. She tried to hook it up with, you know, she knew I didn't have, she didn't, she knew it was, it was, it was a young show and I didn't have the cash that she was looking for. How much cash you looking for? What did she say? Well, here's the thing, you don't want to go down that road because all of a sudden you were chipping Norton. I can't speak for him, but I'll speak for him. I'm not shy. I, uh, it, it felt like, it felt, it would, it would have been odd. I'm kind of a pussy. I didn't want to do it. I get freaked out by like germs and stuff. So I thought, Oh, you're one of those guys. I thought it'd be weird to have sex with him.

Speaker 3:          01:59:18       When you first meet a girl and before you get busy do you started asking questions? So I asked him like in subtle ways, I don't ask him like if you asked a girl that you get kind of a slap if you're really not slap, but apparently you don't. But you know like just kind of like, you know like, like you know like do you like to party or like coke? Yeah, exactly. Like I tried to figure it out. Like you just smoke or like other things that would like lead them to a road of debauchery. What would you feel like if you were with a girl for a long time and then you found out a few years back just to the gang bang movie but she quit. It was bad experience. I would just let down. I mean what about I would flip out. You would flip out and totally.

Speaker 3:          01:59:58       Would you be mad at her? No, not mad. I would just, I don't know that I can be with her if she was awesome. Other than that. What if like up until that moment, like this chick's perfect check. I mean did she go through a lot of therapy after the gang? Nope. She just realized, you know what gang bangs or not for me, I'm moving on, I'm going to time to start teaching Yoga Gang Bang. Like you just don't wake up some morning gang bangs or not for me. Maybe you do. You know what I mean? People, my friend Dave, I told you he crashed his car, never had a drink again. You know, went to a little bit of court, ordered a alcoholics anonymous. But I think other than that, you know what in your scenario and your this scenario that she's a completely new person, I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt.

Speaker 3:          02:00:33       I mean not really, but I just in theoretically, yeah, but if you went down on a little extra salty would you worry that's just some load creeping out and go to the gang gang had been camping up there for a while and I would check myself into an emergency room and stay there. I stayed there for probably two years and I would pay for it on my all myself. You couldn't watch, right? You wouldn't want to watch the gang bang. But someone told you about it and they sent you show. Even watching gang bangs in general me numb. Yeah. It's not a gang banger. I'm not even a two on one sort of a guy. I don't like watching that either. I think it'd be able to talk to these guys like us who are more open talking about porn, who probably watch it the least.

Speaker 3:          02:01:09       Maybe. I don't know. Miami. I think it's the same people who were quiet about it, who are the real sickos probably the least fucked up watching it. But then I have daughters. So porn took on a completely different dimension since uh, since I've had kids. It's, this is a weird thing where you're looking at a porn, like you know for a fact that that used to be a baby. Yeah. That was someone's little girl. There was some oh daddy and hugging on to and now she's getting plugged in the ass and the mouth and she's gagging and that's reality man. I mean that girl you putting it up and she's got her tongue out now on some Jews just fucking jizzing all over her face. That used to be a baby girl. There's no way to get around that and then babies of your own, it totally fucks with your, your, your vision of it.

Speaker 5:          02:01:55       I guess so. Yeah, so that, that's, that's why I don't want to have kids because I want to keep watching. Like you want to keep checking off the porch.

Speaker 3:          02:02:00       That's when dudes move on to milfs see the four guys who were really in the east. It's like you can't even think about them being a baby anymore because it just like 40 and only likes black guys now have you noticed that when you watch porn though that's like,

Speaker 5:          02:02:13       it's like every video was a different girl but it's like four or five guys

Speaker 3:          02:02:19       total and all of the same guys, the same guys over and over. They say a lot of that is because it's hard to do like it's hard to, I'm sure guys to get it up in front of strangers and cameras like and know that people are going to watch your Dick and be comfortable and you say you could. You think you could seriously please. You panic when you stand up.

Speaker 5:          02:02:37       Little half of black little, a little bit of black power in me. I'm fine. Yeah. You say that

Speaker 3:          02:02:43       people find out small. Your Dick really is. They would go, what the Fuck Brian, you said it was big. Jesus. What's wrong? You don't tell the truth about anything. Ever said it was big. That's all I've been in here. He can do pour certainly said it was big. No please. That's big. Yeah, that's big. I just said a little bit. What's average? What's the average ticket you've socked?

Speaker 5:          02:03:05       I would say like five,

Speaker 3:          02:03:07       but honestly though, not even as a joke. How would you know what averages nowadays? Because all the only gets you see are on porn and those are guys who are professional. The only things that you see, this dude is always asking people to show their tech. So he's got some constantly going around measuring. No, no, I definitely not my tape. I definitely have the Internet, so I've seen all sides. That's what I'm saying. And your defense and your defense, the Dicks, you're seeing the cream of the crop. Don't to know. No, you're seeing the best dicks in the world. If you ever know the juiciest most delicious, you're seeing, you're seeing the guys who get paid for those dicks. Don't compare yourself to that. Talk amongst yourselves. I gotta pee mostly

Speaker 5:          02:03:40       comics dicks nowadays. Those are probably smaller than yeah, yeah. I don't know. So, uh, you, uh, you're on your fifth or sixth episode of the show. You've really been listening, man. Jesus Christ. You know, how many third, third episode, three episode five more. Uh, but how many of you recorded, oh, we're done. I actually came from the editing studio just now to wrap the last one. Like we're wrapped as of today, right? And we're done with all aid. Now you with the clip that we saw was completely uncensored. Like the language and everything like that. Are you getting the beat treatment? We're getting the bleeps but um, you can watch them all on a little. Most of the clips around censored online. I wasn't talking to them like most of the clips are uncensored online and um, there's a pos, there's some talk, I don't want to say yet that we may be able to show some uncensored versions late at night or midnight or I don't what the rule is, but I don't want to promise anything.

Speaker 5:          02:04:39       But there has been chatter about that so I want to get a buzz going about it. Right. But I don't want it to be official, you know? Yeah. Well I mean South Park did it, you know, they are moving south park, you know, they, and also south park is TVMA cause they were just like we don't want it. You can't Air TV and maybe before 10 which is, you know when they say shit and fucking stuff so that you can only air the new South Park's after 10. But they said they don't give you no, we don't care because those early, those early reruns are, uh, um, what's going on,

Speaker 3:          02:05:14       Joe of get through the curtain and we have these new curtains in the studio and like, it's just like, you know, have to try to find the opening of a curtain. Yeah. The Joe Rogan experience without Joe Rogan's it'll get a little weird. Um, are you, are you, like you said you're, are you, are you like the kind of person you don't like to shake people's hands and stuff like that doesn't bother me as much anymore. I mean, it used to a little ass play as play is different because that's a nice clean ass. You've wiped it and everything maybe I did is not really cleaning it. Well imagine if someone's smooth shit on your face and you just took a little piece of toilet paper and wipe it off. No, that wouldn't really work. Yeah, really clean that shit. Really. It's, it's really a shower is the only thing that way to clean it up.

Speaker 3:          02:05:52       We've got to get in there. Well, I got one of those Japanese toilets. I still have him fucking installed it. Yeah, cause I'm so God damn busy. But one of the ones that you and I experienced, right. I always wanted to try one. It's the best I should have had it here for you. You just stay on the toilet longer though. Like you find yourself and you just want to feel the water shit, squirt it in your ass and you just don't want to stop it. I need, what if I get a season two that's my first charge. Warm the seats warm and it blows air on your asshole after cleans megahertz. Stern talking about that. It's a whole thing where it like goes up and the whole thing. Some ladies that finds her butthole and that shoots it right in there. Yeah. This has reminded me to go get that fucking thing out of my garage and having installed installed here.

Speaker 3:          02:06:32       Yeah. You got the be, if you've got it installed, we're almost a studio's almost done. We've got the curtains up now, Ben, and you're here to break in the curtains. Yeah. I'm here at this exciting, it feels like show business, right? Curtains. Something about show business. It's about time with the big, we've got the big animal outside and uh, that's a werewolf buddy. It's on animal. It's a werewolf. Look, sorry, we got everything. It's cool. There's a song that I really want to play, but I don't know if we should play by ear. You remember the dance floor Dale? Yeah. There's another guy, uh, that makes us made a song. His name is Mike Diva and it's called I'm on crack and it's just like that and it's so fucking good song that's like registered like, or is it on the, you know, I think he's just one of those guys that's on youtube that just makes these cute little like minute videos based on really good.

Speaker 3:          02:07:14       As long as it's not like on like universal records or something like that. You know, were some big record company. Say what it's from. He just does like a weekly video. Everything. We can do it. I think we would like, it was just, well, what's his name again? His name is on Youtube. It's Mike Diva. It's all one word, you know, a million people going to listen to us easy. So it's kind of fucked up that we even have to, you know, like we should, we should be good. We're helping, we're helping people. But you have to worry the Internet. Isn't this, have you had problems? No, but we have insurance for it and we have, um, we also have lawyers now. Oh, here we'll play, we'll play. Let's play half of it. So you would show something of it? Yeah. Okay. So we're, we're, we're also signing up to a couple of programs

Speaker 8:          02:08:01       back to the club will feel master. I said fuck that shit on. Went back to the bullying. I kept that

Speaker 4:          02:08:17       right, right, right, right. Okay. Hold on. Hold on.

Speaker 3:          02:08:33       This show is, this music is unless inable it's so bad, but the video is really fast. I actually, Mike Diva just made the video. Uh, that song is by a side project called the left rights mindless self indulgence side project. Oh, okay. I mean, in this particular environment, it's mainly visual videos. Impossible to listen to. It's got cats and crack. I love it. It sounds hilarious. I can't stop living around how many views? A 1.8 million. Oh yeah. I just loved the doctors possible that a guy could just put out a video and it's why does it have 1.8 million? Because a bunch of people said, you got to see this. It's pretty wild to watch. Yeah, let's do it, Mario. Yeah, it's great. It's a great video, man. It's a great video. I liked the song. I might buy it. When you go to a video and you see it's got 18 million views and like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          02:09:23       How do I not know about this? How are these people? Well, I've seen the ones with the hundred million views and I'm like, oh, how's that? How's that even possible? I am style. What did that get up to? A billion, billion, billion, billion. This is Mike Diva. Actually. All his videos, I have a lot of hits because he hit that really has a billion views. Yeah. What are we now at 2.5 billion about total humans? Yeah. Whoa. More than that. Seven. We're at seven. Seven, 7 billion. Yeah. What'd I get? No, 2.5 in no dice. I was thinking maybe America write no America, 300 million. Where do I get 2.5 minutes laughing at me. You made it up. Unless you live in the fifties I'm from the fifties I mean you just gave up million people in the world. Yes. Well there's a billion in China alone. There's more than a billion in Africa. Africa is 1.5 billion. I didn't know there was a building. Yeah. So okay, I fucked up. Yeah, it's getting at least to start, we're going to lose. You won't be recorded for life. It's getting crowded. Lack a mind. Fuck. And yeah, that's a lot of people. Maybe Gangam style is not that popular. Well what's really funny, really a billion people. It's 500,000 assholes. We've watched it repeatedly ad nauseum. No, but on different computers though cause he has to be different. I think it has to be different servers really do you think really gives a fuck

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       where the hell are coming from? It would want to elevate that had that problem before because people were putting their videos up and just pressing refresh all day and night to get their, their counselor. It attracts the IP address. So like it, it counts as one view. If you go to it, like if you watched the here and ain't at home, it would count as two. Oh, okay. But if we have different computers at this Ip address, it would count as one. Correct. Okay. And the head of you. So that is, so that's a very pop. There's ways around that though. How do you get around, uh, you use, uh, use proxies, proxies. You just get this list of priorities. They must have had to do that though for advertising purposes. Because I sell advertisement now that makes sense because they do it by CPM, but how many downloads I get? Totally. Yeah. Well if you buy it, if you say you've got millions of views and some company buys your shit and it's just some dude click it over and over, they're going to be pissed, you know? Have you thought about doing a podcast at all? I thought about, I don't know, I'd be a good accompaniment to your show and that some people are telling me I just, I'm not really a talker I think. Are you talking about, I mean I dunno. Yeah, I don't feel like I would.

Speaker 4:          02:11:41       Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:11:42       It's, I'm the wrong guy to ask because again, like I said, not a Ben Hoffman Fan so I'm the wrong person to be asking you about this. But I just feel like I've kind of talked out and I don't really like even on this show I feel like I was done. I was done in an hour. What do you do at home? Like when you get, when you get home tonight or you do, you just watch a lot of movies? Hobby tonight. Cause I have, we have an airing tonight so I have to live tweet a new episode tonight. That's a new thing is you tweet along with the show. Like that's nice. Yeah. Which is fine I guess. But, so I have to go, but I don't have direct TV, so I'll have to go to my friend's house who has direct TV so I can watch the east coast feed to live tweeted. A couple writers will show up and will live tweet the shows. So that'll be fun. But uh, what was the question? I mean like what do you do you have a girlfriend? [inaudible] listen question. I've been talking to you with my therapist. What the fuck am I doing with my team? Yeah, yeah. Even going to a therapist

Speaker 5:          02:12:36       10 years. Really? Yeah. Wow. Oh Dude, I got issues. What's the number one? Do you, can you tell us? The number one would probably be OCD, but what you're showing your hand. I got to say like even today, like I did shake your guys' hands when I came in here and I just now remembered that I did. So it's working I guess because you dealt with the fact that he shook our hands. Didn't go immediately wash yourself. I'm saying not a big step for me is just now remembering that two hours ago I shook your hands in the old days, I would've thought about at the time, like my hands are like toxic or something. Not that you're, it's has nothing to do with the person. Do a meet and greets after shows, like theaters and I'll shake a thousand people's hands. It never, it never occurs to you, you know, then I go eat. Really, you don't wash your hands before you were a case. You're, you, you look at you need to and you shouldn't be scared because there's nothing, there's nothing bad about it. I'm going to kill me with your sweat, but uh, no, but see, I'm cured. I'm not that cured, but getting closer,

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       I'm, no, I tried to wash my hands after I do that, but I have, there's been times where I haven't, you know, for sure, especially if I've got a buzz on, I'm like, yeah, fuck it. Let's go eat.

Speaker 5:          02:13:39       You know? I mean, literally, I've been to, I was talking about this on another place. I don't want to get into it too much, but I had been to behavior therapy where they actually, where you literally get your hands dirty and touch your face, touch yourself. That's how they teach. Telly. Telly teach you to do it. What made you feel like you needed this? It was interfering with my life. Literally. Like I went to go to the, I would be in my car, I'd go get gas and that would be going out to get my meet my friends and I had to go back home to wash my hands. Wow. Home couldn't go to a bathroom. So then by the time you get through all that shit, your day's gone. You know, it interferes with anything. All I care about is anything that's interfering with my life. Do you have like hand sanitizer? I don't, I don't touch this. I need to get your guy to Howie Mendell. You know how he's, yeah, I know he's like, but heroes. But he, he sounds like he's not dealing with it, but he talks about it though. He talks about it, but do it. I did work past it, dealing with my issues.

Speaker 2:          02:14:37       You know what I like about that? What you're dealing with, that you're willing to talk about it. I think that's Super,

Speaker 5:          02:14:42       oh, that's the thing is it was never shy about it, but I, but that's huge shooting people, but I had no issues. I like to, to be open about it and deal with them and that helps me kind of get rid of them.

Speaker 2:          02:14:53       Well, it also helps by gauging other people's reactions, whether or not it's a real issue or whether or not it's,

Speaker 5:          02:14:58       well it was so bad, but yeah, family members noticed it. That's how I knew it. And I'm like, maybe this is because I didn't know what OCD was. Right. And I'm like, I read about it and I'm like, shit, I have this time to a hundred you know, this is bad. And like there is a, I can fix this and improve my life. I'm like, that sounds interesting to me.

Speaker 2:          02:15:16       Yeah. It's, it's really bad to keep that stuff to yourself if something's really fucking with you. Because I think that there's a lot of insight that you get just from talking to people. Like I've had conversations with people where they tell me something about something fucked up about themselves and they go, you know what? I realize I'm not fucking doing that anymore, man. I've, I've, I've seen people do though. A friend of mine quit smoking in front of me once he was, um, he was smoking. We were about to go do a Gig and a, I go, you are you smoking? And he goes, I only smoked before shows. I go, but do you do shows like fucking four days a week? And he goes, yeah. He goes, I go with some, it seems like you're smoking. And he goes, well, I like a cigarette right before I do a show.

Speaker 2:          02:15:49       And I go, um, does it, have you done many shows without it? And he goes, yeah, I mean, I just started doing this. I go, God damn, man. He goes, you know what? You're right. What the fuck am I doing? I'm like, well, yeah, what are you doing? And so then he put his cigarette out and he quit and he tells me like every time I see him, I haven't smoked since. No, it wasn't even that I helped him. It's just that having that conversation in front of somebody who reacts to it. Like if someone says, Hey Ben, stop washing your fucking hands every 10 minutes you need to go see a doctor. There's something crazy about that. And you're right. You know what? Yeah, I do.

Speaker 5:          02:16:17       You like the, basically what you're saying is exactly what happened and just opening up and talking to a doctor about it. It's like fucking fix it. You asshole. Like you don't want to do this your whole life. Like someone like Hyman again, I don't know how met Adele, but wouldn't that get in your, wouldn't that be annoying when you want to get it fixed?

Speaker 1:          02:16:33       Well, I'm on the subs to the opposite end of the spectrum cause I've done Jujitsu for like 16 years. Jujitsu is men sweating in your mouth. You Girls Hassles. Well, I mean I'm not averse to that either. If the young ladies willing to clean herself up. Right. But my, my throne other subject. But you put your OCD, you saw that is not healthy either. I wonder how many people have gotten sick from eating ass. You eat raw horse meat, so that's like, I'm way more chimpanzee than you. My Body can digest that horse meat without a problem. I very rarely get stomach aches. Um, is that true? Yeah. Yeah. I, I ate me. Yeah. I was in a restaurant. They served us raw horse meat. I was going to say didn't enter the new, the new thing. Like apparently we're all eating horse meat. No, no.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       That was a, in the UK there was uh, some food company got, it was like a Lasagna or something like this. Like he had kissed Swedish meatballs. Yeah. And they had pushed me to them. By the way. The horse meat. Delicious. It's really good for you. And people looked through [inaudible] horse meat. Yes and no. I mean, isn't it fucked up to eat a cow? Isn't it fucked up to get a goat? Yeah. I'm from Kentucky where they take their horses very seriously, but I wouldn't if I was hungry, you know, what am I going to this one? Most people throughout history have eaten horses. It's been, it's been a guarantee. Yeah. I mean the Mongols eight, their horses. I mean, people have always eaten horses at Ikea once, so I'm sure I should really was the sweetest. I thought that was in the UK. Wasn't that over there?

Speaker 1:          02:17:59       I don't know. It might've been over there, but I heard it was here too. I think it was, well, they're just starting to, um, I think it was, there's an Amish, a horse company company that deals with the Amish where they're getting horses in. They're slaughtering them now, like older horses and they're slaughtering them for meat. And uh, the idea is they're doing it through the Amish because the Amish, they don't believe in the steroids or any of the things that you would worry about a horse having in its body if you ate it. Yeah, that'd be more people are fucking super, you have a Pete do you have to pay or something? I just look anxious. People are super attached to their horses though, man. I live, I live near and this a question center and I'm taking my daughter to go ride around on horses and shit. And there's a lot of people there that would like, I mean if you told them that you were going to serve people some horse meat, they would, they would fuck

Speaker 5:          02:18:50       freedive. I again, being from Kentucky, I live friends who make their living, you know, doing that kind of it so I know where they're coming from. Are you a horse person now?

Speaker 1:          02:18:59       No, not particularly. I mean, I don't hate horses. I liked horses. I was never that interested in like, I mean I think it's a fun way to travel, get on a horse and go on a trail. It's all good. I like it, but it's not something, I mean, I could get into it. I could see fallen in love with a horse and taking it, you know, like, oh, this is such a great horse. I love having this horse and cleaned it up and brush it and feed it and he'd be your buddy. I could totally see that, but I haven't had that personal experience. And I feel like

Speaker 2:          02:19:27       at the end of the day that the justification of eating animals is pretty sketchy at best anyway. And then really we're just fucking murdering all these animals and eating them eyes. It really matter if it's a horse or a cow

Speaker 5:          02:19:38       Vegan for one year for no reason. I wasn't like, you know, like an animal rights person and I just like, I wanted to, I wanted to see what I just, for some reason it was kind of during my OCD, just like animals or like filthy and Phillip Bacteria. So I stopped eating. It's not healthy. I don't like I was, I got really, really thin and like really tired all the time. Like I didn't do it correctly, probably.

Speaker 2:          02:20:00       Well because of that I'm sure. But there's also, there's, there's certain needs that we have and one of them is, uh, the, the function that cholesterol has and brain function, you know, cholesterol, like it's not all bad for you as a matter of fact. And they do. The test

Speaker 5:          02:20:17       doctor gives you the test, he tells you your good cholesterol in your bag.

Speaker 2:          02:20:19       Yeah. But the good cholesterol comes from animal protein comes from fish. I felt like shit, most of that time, some of it's from plants you can get, you can balance it out if you're really diligent.

Speaker 5:          02:20:31       Two are vegans who know how to do it correctly, but it's a lot of work.

Speaker 2:          02:20:35       Yeah. Um, there's very few high level athletes that have done it. That's what I was, I was gonna say there's gotta be none. The only, I mean, the only person I can think of, well known didn't Clinton built in Bill Clinton become vegan because it's hard heart issues and he was about to die. That fat fuck was just fucking eating cheeseburgers constantly. Yeah. Cholesterol plays a critical role in PR and brain function and cholesterol comes from animals. I mean that's where it comes from. I don't know of cholesterol was even available in the, um, in, in the plant community. The plant kingdom. Is it? I don't think so. You're asking the wrong guy. I think cholesterol only comes from animals. I'm pretty sure I'm cholesterol is a substance. Genetically I'm painted as black by the medical and scientific community. But the fact remains that is a substance that is innate to the body and forms a critical part of, among other things, key hormones, vitamin D and cell membranes.

Speaker 2:          02:21:27       It also, it's also very concentrated in the brain where it contributes to the functioning of synapses, tiny gaps between the cells which allow the nerves to communicate with each other. That's one of the things that we had with um, um, uh, Dave Asprey talked about this and uh, Rob Wolf from, uh, Rob Wolf who's a primal diet advocate. He's a advocate of the, uh, um, well it's uh, his, his whole, I, it's all the um, uh, Paleo. The idea. Yeah. Look, there's, there's a lot of logic behind Paleo diets when it comes to the human body not being designed to consume wheat, not beings designed to eat pastas and designed to eat lean grass, fed protein and vegetables. Like, that's really what,

Speaker 5:          02:22:16       what's the date where you can, it's all has to be the stuff. Stuff that you eat with. Use your hands to eat. Is that what I'm thinking?

Speaker 2:          02:22:20       No. Paleo. You can use forks. Yeah, but they're so funny, man. He lends itself some new die. It's like

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       the caveman diet where you, it's the only things you can eat. The caveman would, he's probably an idiot. I didn't say he wasn't an idiot. No reason to not use a fork. The forks or so on nutritious, I think. I think he's, I think he was like the idea of anything. Like you only eat stuff that cavemen woody. Oh yeah. Well I think you're misreading what he's saying. That's Paleo. That's fairly Olympic error. That's crazy, man. I'm thinking about the right thing. I just, I just said it incorrectly. Well, no, this is not about utensils is what he's using that as a way to explain it to me. Oh, okay. I see. Because I don't understand things, but the idea is that genetically we're not much different from the people that live 40 50,000 years ago. In fact, we're probably exactly the same. You could take a guy from 50,000 years ago was a Homosapien, dress him up in clothes and stick them in a movie theater and before the movie starts, you wouldn't even be able to figure out who the caveman is.

Speaker 3:          02:23:13       It's just once the movie begins and he starts fucking screaming and running out of the room, then you know that's the case. But depending on the movie, you might be me. Yeah. You think that's screaming and yeah. More than a caveman who's never seen a movie before. Yeah. If I write, what would be the one movie that would make you scream like Les Miz? Probably Miss. Yeah. I don't know. I saw that lame ass thing. I'm like, if I had to choose between Kona jail where nobody talked to me for 24 hours or watching Les Ms for 24 hours straight. I think you did cite it. So take solitary for a day. How was it? I have a thing. I don't know. I have no idea. There's no way I'm going to see that. Okay. Now I want to see a movie. About a bunch of people crying that lived in the day where there was no TV or internet and they were all fucking singing everything and crying.

Speaker 3:          02:23:54       I was draining. A friend told me that it was so bad that you should maybe see it then. I'm like, but I'm, I'm, I don't know about you guys. I'm not one of those guys who likes, I don't get enjoyment out of things that are so bad. They're good. That's not fun for me. I do out of some things like, um, the, do you ever see the day after tomorrow? No. It's that really bad movie about global warming where a, it becomes like this crazy snow storm that covers north America and everybody dies except Dennis Quaid who goes camping. Uh, he's outside. It's fucking a hundred million degrees below zero. He's got a 10 east fines sipping coffee and shit. It's like, get over here guys. That's his voice through the whole movie. Weird voice. Like it sounded like a South Park character and I thought talking about watch that movie and think of South Park and top sounds so much like a self.

Speaker 3:          02:24:40       Totally making something. I'll pull up. Pull up a scene. All right. Hold up a scene desk. Wait, you just totally made that up. Oh yes. Yeah. First of all, he's a fine actor and you are disparaging that man's name and reputation. Uh, the day after tomorrow, Sky's got insurance. You can't disparage his name. Yeah, you can't do that, bro. I have a fucking podcast look out for it. Can't just be making shit up. I just think, shut up man. Stop it with the gay voice. Stop at Gay Voice. Listen, Paris Hilton is already mad at me or the other one that Perez Hilton, one of those guys, check this out and tell me if this does not sound like a, like somebody from South Park's is doing. Dennis Quaid voice is better not be a parody site. You took me til you fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:25:14       Got It.

Speaker 3:          02:25:17       Century Fox presents 10,000 years ago, one store

Speaker 9:          02:25:28       change the face of our planet. That is true this year. Maybe not a store. Maybe it's an asteroid impact. It's pretty short.

Speaker 4:          02:25:39       You see is JPL was battered by the loggers? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:26:11       If you're listening to this at home, this is not nearly as interesting as watching. What can we do there? Go. The safer they'll be DT for him to suggest this plan. What's happening here in Washington. His son is a Manhattan. I'm the director of still, so that's it. That's his voice. What should we do? I will come for you. Do you understand me? Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

Speaker 4:          02:26:41       Shut it off.

Speaker 2:          02:26:45       He made things up again. Turn it back on. You may turn my voice on you made it, made it up again. You're fucked. There's nothing wrong with that guys.

Speaker 3:          02:26:52       I will shut the fuck I'm for you not to go with Joe Rogan on this. Just wasted our time. I'm just saying that my opinion, Dennis Quaid, his voice sounds like he sounds like Trey Parker. That's what I'm saying. That's all I'm saying. You just take it to that level and for some reason you are absolutely incorrect. He does not sound like treat you with that. That's my opinion. Oh my God, Brian, we all heard, hey, if he sounded totally normal, you're like, hi guy. If that is not what he sounded like and we, we, we, we listened to one sentence. By the way, if you don't put on some headphones and you play it and you find me a representative of what the fuck you were saying and if it's not true, we're going to hold you down. True thing. I'm just saying, I think Dennis Quaid his voice sounds like Trey Parker doing south park. That's all I'm saying. I'm saying you might have brain damage. No, I agree with me on that. Yeah, that'd be a mediator on this three or four crazy fucks out there going, yeah. Bam. I'm on your thigh. Your persecuted on I show you're totally correct in your assumption that he throws like pre park and you said when you do you sell just like, don't you sound like Dennis Coy? You just know

Speaker 2:          02:27:57       like what I wanted to sound like the, but that's a good, uh, a good example of a movie that's so bad that it becomes funny.

Speaker 3:          02:28:07       See, I haven't seen it all now after seeing that Promo, I do one on one. Have you ever seen either you show girls? Yeah, that's a good, that's, that's an example of a good movie. That's fine. Have you seen the room? What is the room? You don't know? You guys know about the rule. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. I have that. Have that on video.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       It's made me buy it. It's the best. It's hilarious. It's so bad. I can't get through it though.

Speaker 5:          02:28:26       It's tough. But I, in the theaters it's, it's almost like, I never saw a rocky horror picture show or anything like that in the theaters. But this is like, you go there. I think the theater's gone actually where they use to be.

Speaker 1:          02:28:35       Well, the one in sunset or it's there. It's now it's different theaters or something. Yeah. For folks who don't know what we're talking about, the room, there was a billboard on La Cienega. No, no, on the brayer. And the billboard was up for years. That was the room, the movie, and it was this guy's face, Tommy Wiseau, who's this weird looking dude who looks like like a monster or something. It looks like strange and it gets naked in the film. Well in the movie, he like gets to fuck all the girls and he's like the star of the movie. He wrote the movie for himself, apparently

Speaker 5:          02:29:05       paid for it all apparently. And he uh, um, yeah, paid for the whole thing. It was what happened. Here's the story I was told was that he put it, he put it in all these film festivals and some stone kid at Ucla went to like the UCLA film festival by himself and just walked into this film and he comes back to his dorm room. He goes, Dude's, I'm not positive, but I think I just saw the best film ever made it. Will you guys come back to tonight? They're playing it again and like went back to the 10 friends and they all thought it was fucking, that's the ad. Is that ad still up? But he paid to have it, uh, you know, to put it, it was, he paid the money to make it in competition for the Oscars. The unit costs a lot of money to like make your movie.

Speaker 5:          02:29:46       Did he try to get nominated? And it is. I remember, uh, but I used to go to the screenings when they had like a few years ago and it was a funny thing. He would do Q and A's before he would go to every screening and while people laughed at his film and he would go do a Q and a beforehand, I remember one guy goes, they would make up questions secret, see what kind of crazy answers he would come with. And this guy goes, is it true that your film was funded by Nazi gold? And it's so crazy the guy he was, and he goes, he gets goes, no comment. Wow. Like he like, you're supposed to say no dude. Yeah. Like he did. Obviously the answer's no, but he just doesn't, I don't really understand the question

Speaker 1:          02:30:24       is that he doesn't understand it or is it, he's just so fucking stupid. He's so dumb and then a play cool.

Speaker 5:          02:30:29       Cause I, uh, I, uh, I went there for my, with my friends for my birthday and he signed my poster, don't, happy birthday. Ben and I was walking, I went to the bathroom with the poster man. He goes, you want me to tell? I'll do graph for your poster. I'm like, you just did five minutes ago. He's like, I'll all right. And he picks it out and you autographs. I have a poster of him with the autograph twice.

Speaker 1:          02:30:50       Wow. So there's something wrong with them.

Speaker 5:          02:30:51       There's something really wrong, but he's got a lot of money and his money. That's the thing. No one knows. Hmm. Not, not. Well, it could be not to go if we don't know. He didn't.

Speaker 1:          02:31:01       Whoa. So maybe he's on your vampire or something.

Speaker 5:          02:31:04       It had had the vamp, like people are trying to find pictures of him in the daylight because people claim he's available.

Speaker 1:          02:31:10       Well, he looks like a vampire that's got a very, your empire. Look at the movie. The, the poster rather the, the room. The movie. When I was on the road, I thought it was a horror movie. It looks like a horse because he's

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       brooding is his hair is long. He looks like Chris Gaines. He claimed his gains if he was, yeah, he was the whole time. Garth Brooks, his new role that I think a fucked up when I told them it was Garth Brooks, if I just make movies as this new dude, I'm telling you man, we didn't, they remake and Moody sometimes it didn't. They remake the trailers of the room and turn it into like a comedy. You wouldn't be found out. People were laughing. They made it. Apparently he tried to pretend that he meant to do everything wrong with the room and eight minutes or less spoilers. The Oh, awesome. This is great. Written by Tommy was and the Holy Ghost look the weird. Okay. He comes in and there's a really hot girl this time Tommy said yes.

Speaker 10:         02:32:05       Hi Doug. Hi Babe. Oh Hi mark. Hi to everyone. He's got this weird look too. Guys got long, obviously dyed black

Speaker 3:          02:32:18       care and he looks like he's probably in his like late forties but like really like a harsh features. But he's playing like a 23 year olds. Yeah, but he's playing like this stud and so he hooks up with all these girls in this movie. So he's always like banging. He's like banging left and right and this movie, Oh, I love this song from laying down the soundtrack. The record skipped. The flower shop owner doesn't know what's Johnny even though no one on the entire earth looks like Johnny, you're my favorite custom. So what was up with not recognizing me? You're my favorite cup. That wholly at Denny is a creepy bastard. It's just kidding. Holy Shit. Denny is a grumpy bastard. Tawny was El reads lines. He wrote like he doesn't understand them. Think I will ever get it. They betray me, but they didn't keep their promise.

Speaker 3:          02:33:00       They tricked me and I don't care anymore. The best way to be someone who doesn't drink is a combination of scotch or vodka. Scott's in fact, that was his drinking scotch. Scotch. Scotch gun is not your mother's cooking. You do not need to lie about Scotchgard at some. No cane, no cane. Yeah, it is a weird, I recommend that movie to everyone. It's the fucking best. As someone who doesn't like that kind of stuff, they had screenings all the time still I guess. Where are they now? I began invited all the time and I think maybe the silent movie theater or somewhere like that. That's probably where it is. It cause it was at that sunset five and now that's like Robert Redford theater. Yeah, it seems like it would be a good thing to go to get, get a little drunk and go with a bunch of friends.

Speaker 3:          02:33:42       It is. It's fine. Until that theater closed, they would have like four room. No, no point. You're like four different screens going on at once and pack the place for the room and people and the, and he would be there. Why people are laughing at his moody. It's crazy. Wow. Well I guess for a guy like that he must be so torn because it's obviously getting a lot of a tank, getting his money. Man, he's getting his money back and he's becoming famous yet I feel like it's fee. Don't you feel like it's famous? It's like died down that like it's Kinda old news. Maybe he'll come back again because he was telling people he's doing a new movie with De Niro, which is obviously made up, but I haven't

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       heard what he's up to

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       as always. You never know. Man. Deniro has been doing some fucking, I think he's doing movies lately. I don't know. That's that one that he did with with Sharon Stone where he's a wizard or something like that. No, it was, that was that movie pull up the, the, the photo. Just the, he's done some fucking clearly gets paid movies.

Speaker 5:          02:34:39       I guess the DVD of the room that they did that, the commentary that director's commentaries gold really. I can only imagine. I'm sure talking about his motivation and each individual scene, someone posted online to the auditions for this, for the movie,

Speaker 1:          02:34:57       which I can't watch. Well, one of the things about moving to Hollywood, I moved here in [inaudible] 94 I had no experience whatsoever with actors. I didn't know any. I knew comics who a lot of people will say that comics are a lot like actors because they're very needy and they're very self centered, but I don't find that to be true. I think the really good comics especially, they're really interesting people. They're fun to hang out with and talk to, but actors, I've met some actors that were so bizarrely self centered and so bizarrely like unaware of how a normal person would look at them and how they behave that this kind of the room movie thing makes sense to me. If you didn't live here and didn't know these people, right?

Speaker 5:          02:35:41       Real life we have you say that. I wonder if you were not in La, if, if he would, it would be. It's funny you're laughing at it because it's because you live in Hollywood and this is worst representative of that guy. Know that guy. Totally. Yeah, and it's probably a piece of me and that guy, a very small piece, but still, you know, like I would, I've sure I've auditioned for shit worse than that. I'm actually not worse than that. But you know of a district or some shit

Speaker 1:          02:36:06       met people that were completely crazy that were making their own movies and coming up to you with the, I know object or trying to do,

Speaker 5:          02:36:13       I know a lot of people still, Mike, if you ever seen when he said heat, it's just going to say the same thing. Reminds me of windy city. What the fuck is funnier than windy city? What's funnier? Well that guy, the problem with when he said he is, I know

Speaker 1:          02:36:24       God that guy is always around. He was always around the common story. That guy was annoying as fuck. And they're like, they sort of legitimized him in a way and gave him some juice.

Speaker 5:          02:36:34       I do it cause I just did, again, not to brag, but I was, I did, I did Kimmel last week. And so like all the writers, you know, he, he produced that film and uh, so all the writers and producers and stuff or like, you know, there'll be nice to me and I'm just like, it sells Saul Steinberg would screen, but you know, I'm like, you know, uncles, cousin sal, like I know him from windy city heat, right? Like mole. I know him from the movie and stuff as opposed to like their jobs on Kimmel. I've watched 20 city heat. So many folks have done a new one. I keep praying about it. Uh, they filmed the, about five years ago, they filmed the beginning part and like I like, I like that just to try it out, you know, like the idea of Johnny Knoxville was supposed to Jackson by her as scary. Perry and I actually got to sit and the filming and I

Speaker 7:          02:37:15       sat next to Jimmy Kimmel watching this and it was beautiful. And then scary. Perry comes in and goes, I'm scary Perry, you know, and stuff, and I don't know, whatever happened happened to it because they also made a Ding Dong show movie that immediately got shelved. For some reason, only a few people saw it and I heard it was [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:37:32       Oh, there's a windy city heat pog big three podcasts. It's really funny, but I don't listen to movie. The problem that Ding Dong movie would be that I guarantee the people in the Ding dog movie probably protested them, put it in the movie, mocked like that. Yeah. If you never heard of the Ding Dong show, Don Barris, who's a buddy of ours, does it show at the comedy store on a regular basis where he brings the worst acts known to man, like this Guy Peter Chin and these like terrible, terrible comedians. And they saw a big three from what he said, he him, and he's always been doing this. Don's been doing this almost like there's this constant running art projects since the beginning of time, since as long as I've known him, he's had these shows there where he would do these, these ding dongs shows where he just has these unbelievably bad comedians and he treats them like they're artists and you know that go up.

Speaker 1:          02:38:17       I know, I see. I still haven't seen it a lot, but we did the podcast at death squad. Yeah, he does. Uh, how many, if he's done, how many so far? We just finished our 13th I'll listen to that. Yeah, he's a great guy too. He's a, and he's in when he said he hate to write. Yup. He's, he's one of the big three. He's a star. Dawn Buress is awesome. He's a great guy too. He's like one of those guys that like, he's like, to me, he's like a hidden treasure in the world of entertainment. I was like, how do I fuck the more people not know about Don Baer?

Speaker 7:          02:38:45       Yeah. I mean, I mean watching him every night, it's, it's amazing that he does what he does every single fucking night. Yeah, he does that and I mean he's there every night, three units, Kimmel and then he goes straight there and he's there every morning till three in the morning. Just like entertaining. Like sometimes two people in the audience.

Speaker 1:          02:39:02       Once I was the youngest people in the parking lot. Yeah, he'll do a set in the parking lot. He's hilarious and he's a great guy. He just, for whatever reason, the world hasn't found his place yet. But no, I like when he said he, he is different than the room. I'll show that to friends like back in Kentucky and there'll be cracking up and they give it to their friend. Have you seen showgirls? Showgirls, right house, but where do you said he to legitimately good move. Yeah. Yeah. Well when the city, he was good on purpose. Yes, exactly. Whereas showgirls and Roadhouse, we're like, showgirls is probably the best example of what we were talking. Roadhouse is the best example of a cocaine movie. Well, you know that they were on coke when they were making that movie. Like there's no other way you could think this was good.

Speaker 1:          02:39:37       You got to be cooked. I, I'll go, oh yeah, fuck yeah. Tell him paint don't hurt pain. Don't hurt most of the eighties movies, showgirls to showgirls, breach of coke. Certainly in the writing. Yeah. Well in the performance to the whole thing is just chaos. It's just like you thought this was what? And he took the girl from saved by the bell and what and how come? No Way. We've talked her into doing some squats before this movie. Exactly. Bullet, but what? Well, how much did it, how much of a, it was a horrible bomb, right? Oh yeah. Well I think it made money though. It had to have so many people over time that those special additions now where you can buy it with like the comes with like the stripper stuff and all this scene

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       where the fuck was she fucks that guy from, what was that? That uh, what was that show? Blue Velvet. Was that Mclaughlin? Yeah, that guy. Remember she fucks him in the pool. Holy. It's the most ridiculous thing ever. She starts flopping around and slapping the water like a fish while he's banging her and he's just like, yeah, it's a long way down from blue velvet and you're like, what are you doing? No one fucks like that. Stop this. This doesn't make any sense, but in the movie it totally made sense. The water, she's wild. She's unpredictable. God getting my trailer suck my cock. We'll get it. Heart, get it hard. We got to film this fucking movement and finish this movie so you could suck my cock more. All right. Actually I'm fucking chaotic. Crazy movie. Have you seen grizzly man? Yes. I would say it's better than showgirls.

Speaker 3:          02:41:05       Yes, it might. Maybe the greatest movie ever made. It is a great movie as far as documentaries. When I recommend to people if they say, if you recommend a documentary, I say grizzly man. It's weird because mine would be the one I said before is the staircase and that you got to see that when bums me out, man. No, you'll love it. You'll love it. I'm trying to think. But yeah, I spent most of my, if I'm going to watch a movie, I'll watch a documentary way before any kind of, that's all I watched his documentaries. Yeah, I've been watching quite a few of them lately. There's a, this is a good time for documentaries. I love that. I have the apple iTunes or whatever the fuck it is. What's the TV? Apple TV. Apple TV. And um, you go to the documentary section and it's just documentary documentary.

Speaker 3:          02:41:48       I saw this really good. Uh, Dave Grohl made this sound city movie. I didn't watch it yet. It was really cool. He got the thumbs up over here. It was, it was great man. It was like the, the, the story of this, uh, recording studio. I think it was in the valley, right? It's North Ridge, I believe. Yeah. It's like all this, like nevermind was all these classic albums. Fleetwood rumors is made. They're like the story of all these great fucking albums and Dave Grohl made the movie. It's fucking great. But [inaudible] doesn't get nearly enough credit in the world of great albums and people don't talk about like Fleetwood Mac there. What's better than rumors? It's fucking phenomenal. You and Elsa is great too. I just talking about this with a friend Tusk is pretty amazing too. It's pretty fucking good. Yeah. Both due to Fleetwood Mac was bad at their height.

Speaker 3:          02:42:31       There wasn't much better. Yeah, I was listening to the other day, you know, jam band is all about timber lake over there. That song you make love and fun. God Damn, that's a good song. Well, the rumors is spotless. Yeah. Yeah. And I say Tusk is too, but some people would argue, but I love that. Um, just because I heard them, Gene Simmons made a quote or made a tweet about a video that, uh, I've been meaning to watch for a while called searching for sugar man. Oh, I tell it how it gets rich. Really good. Um, I have a very cynical view of documentaries sometimes. So I'm not sure how much, but I actually, I googled it and I didn't find much. What I do is I watch documentaries and I Google it and see how much, like if there's a lot of talking about how it's bullshit,

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       right. And the bullshit meter on that one was pretty low. So it could be,

Speaker 2:          02:43:15       well then tell the top people with the story, the pendant, the guy who was it,

Speaker 5:          02:43:18       he was a musician in Michigan. It was like may two albums that no one had heard of. And he went and he think he worked at maybe some kind of factory or something. No, he was unknown for 30 years. It turns out his albums had taken off in, um, uh, South Africa, South Africa, and he was, it was part of the apartheid movement, really was his, just the soundtrack to his, of his albums. And he didn't know, he was so famous over there and Elvis fan base. And people thought the story had come out that he died. And like 20 years later, someone heard the news that he wasn't. Dot didn't die. He was living in an apartment in Michigan, Detroit, and they brought him back. Uh, you know, it comes back, it's almost like an anvil type thing where he comes back and he's like, goes over there and just plays the stadiums now. He played Letterman. I think he's now going on tour and playing any gigs.

Speaker 2:          02:44:03       He was huge. And meanwhile just had a family, normal guy, raised his daughters but had no idea that he, he was told that these albums were bombs that they didn't make a penny. Well, meanwhile there it's good music. It's pretty good. Yeah. I buddy might just saw the show here instead. It was good. We were talking about our friends, honey, honey. Um, I found out about honey honey through a guy on my message board who, uh, just sent me a dude named balls of steel. That's his name. Sent me this link. And so this is going to be your new favorite band and I'm one kind of music. It's like country rock, like sort of rock country ish. It's, it's very hard to describe. But when we, when I listened to it I like, I went, how the fuck are they not famous? Like every now and then you'll hear music and the whole, they have two cds and bolt of them are excellent and I'm going to go listen to this.

Speaker 2:          02:44:49       The, the, the new, the first one is called First Rodeo and then the, um, the second one, I forget what the name of the second one is, but whatever it is, it's, it's a, it's fucking amazing. It's like you, you listened to it and you go, how the fuck is it on iTunes? Famous? Yeah. Yeah. It's on iTunes. Check it out. But I think it's hard as fuck to make it in the world of music today, especially because of the fact that there's not that much out there as far as like radio. There's no dude, it's admits and pie. If you, if you want to play instruments, if I forget, it's not that much as far as like being able to sell, being able to sell videos and shit, or being able to sell records like a good fucking luck man. Although it has spread out. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:45:26       Till you can make a, it's easier to make a living like a low, you know, low money. There's more, there's more bands making like 50 grand a year, then they're everywhere. But there's nobody making that like big money. That's the thing. Well

Speaker 2:          02:45:38       band, um, they, you know, they've been touring around the country and they're slowly starting to take steam, but it doesn't make any sense when you see some of the shit that's famous. And if some of the people are famous, like these guys are like completely, totally legit. Like how were they? Not huge.

Speaker 5:          02:45:56       Well I don't even listen to the radio anymore. I mean, do you listen to like music on the Radio K rock?

Speaker 2:          02:46:01       I listened to in La on occasion, but for the most part, no, but it's just, it takes more than being talented today. Today we're in this weird like void area where what you're starting to get his people that become famous through the Internet, through people retweeting and, and, and sending their, you know, youtube likes and stuff like that. Like you're starting to see that, but like put out, putting on a CD and just releasing it in a record store, it's not, doesn't happen me.

Speaker 3:          02:46:30       So those days are gone. It doesn't exist. You have to have an internet presence, which, which is cool. If you were a band, let's say from a small town in Kentucky and you wanted to get your music out there, it's a different world. You can get it to get it everywhere. But yeah, it's harder to make that giant leap. Yeah. Well, um, but you made it dude, look at you. Yeah, exactly. Can comedy central the fucking biggest. I'm the hottest comedian. Chavez live in large. Did they let you into the, uh, Daniel Tosh Hooker factory? Where are you going to see all the process? No, I've never met him. Give you the golden robe. I listen. I got to get some higher numbers before I get to that. Yeah. Tosh apparently can sell out stadiums with one tweet. Seriously puts out one tweet and he sells out like 20 stadiums in a row.

Speaker 3:          02:47:13       Yeah, he's, he's balling the lead into my show is a rerun. If his show that beats my shot. I mean like an old raven fucking good show, man. Anybody who has anything to say bad about that shows a hater. That's a good solid fucking, sorry man. I can't say anything bad about a show that, that my show that paid for my show. You know, what am I going to say? Hey, I recommend tosh point hole by the way, which is called the movies at the hotel in San Diego. It's a gay tosh recommend that. Stop. Was that really in a hotel? That's not cool. How rude you fuck. Um, this Friday night, Brian is going to be at the Ice House in Pasadena with Tony Hinchcliffe. Who else? Kevin Christie Shula and there's a bunch of people that are going to be added to the show in the next day or two. But tickets or at ice house, comedy.com it's t at, uh, 10 o'clock. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:48:03       That place is the ice house. If you'd never been there to us. Like right now that's like our, our base. That's pretty much our home base, right? I mean that's, that's kind of a mecca for comedians these days. It's a really unusual spot. It's a beautiful club. It's in Pasadena. It's the oldest club in the country, I believe. Yeah. I think it was in the 1950s that they first opened. And became a comedy club in the 60s, 51st anniversary. Jesus Christ 51st fucking anniversary mean. That's, that's insanity man.

Speaker 3:          02:48:30       Yeah. That is a long time. And that Steve Martin used to do it in his book that you can get on audible. He talks about the ice house throughout that whole thing. I read that book, but after your recommendation, I want, I want to listen to that book. Yeah. Well we're there all the time. I'll be, yeah,

I'm just getting too old for it or something. I Dunno. I'm 37 hope dare you. Yeah. I just started drinking Jackson. I just, I don't know. I can't hold my alcohol anymore.
