Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Who won? Brian Kalin, [inaudible] survivor and, and wearing a sky blue shirt please. If I call you terrorist survivor, how much hate do you think I'll get? It seems like a nice green light for people to get upset for no reason. Well, you know, I think that everybody wants to be, if you've not been affected by it, but you were there, you want somehow credit. Like I found myself, I was 800 feet exactly away from the blast because I was at the Gotham Comedy Club Two oh eight w I think west 23rd and the volume was at one 33. It's hard for me to think of how big 800 feet is. So like when I'm on my block, half a block, if you look it on, if you will, if you actually close, if you look at on your Google maps, it's Av block. And um, so you were about to go on stage.

Speaker 1:          00:00:45       I was about to go on stage and I was with Jimmy Burke, the national treasure. That is Jimmy Burke. I love Jimmy. Of course you do. Who doesn't? And we were talking in the front of the club. So I was literally right behind the front door and the Gotham comedy club, you have to walk all the way down and go into the room. So, um, probably about 25 yards. So I'm literally on the street, but with the door in front of us and we just hear about boom. And that's sickening sound. Well, you know, it's a bomb, you know, it's not a manhole cover. You know what I mean? You just know it's just too long. I've ever heard a bomb. It's horrifying. And it was 800 feet away before that. You did when you were, cause I lived in Lebanon. Right. So I had, uh, in fact I remember going back to Lebanon, I can't remember the year, but they shot a missile.

Speaker 1:          00:01:31       It was a test fire, a missile over our head on the beach. I will never forget this. It was so loud that we fell down on the ground. We were on the beach. It was so loud. I don't know if that was because it was shot over our heads in the sonic boom, but we fell down. It May and it was either a shell or something. But I remember, and you don't see it though. You don't see the, you know, the, the shell because it's going so fast. But what you do is you hear this insanely loud noise. And I remember looking around and everybody fell down and I fell down. I, you know, you, you, you know, um, it's not even like a fall down. You are, it's like you lose your balance and you're, you're reaching for something to hold onto, but then you go down your hands and knees.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       And it was really strange thing. So, um, and I remember being a kid in Lebanon and seeing, uh, uh, planes, Bama gas station from the balcony, and then we had to go downstairs and sleep in the, in the garage. But, um, so I, I heard loud noises as a kid, very loud noises, but this, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm not a seasoned terrorism expert here. Uh, you know, a experience her and I don't think anybody is, and it certainly wasn't think about this, this was a pressure cooker. This was not a car bomb and that was 800 feet away, which is how many football fields explain, cause it was the same sort of bomb the used in the Boston marathon bombings right to go, right. Same kind of thing. And I believe it was hooked up to a cell phone. Yeah. That's how it was activated.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       Your cell phone. Yeah. And when that thing went off you just knew it was a mom. And the crazy that the sickening thing was before that they said you got four minutes, he's coming off in four minutes. And I, I ended up, we were in the front there and Jimmy and I were talking and I said, no problem. And this bomb goes off. And I said to Jimmy, I go, that was a bomb. And he goes, yes it was. And we'd go outside and I see smoke and it's quiet, you know, because there's this pause before the storm sort of, and it just, I saw smoke and you could smell this sort of um, like a burning thing, you know, it smelled like smoke um, quickly and then you then instead of people running towards you in screaming, they were jogging New Yorkers like ah, the fuck man, come on.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       That's right. You know, and they were jogging. So your instinct is to go toward the blast, you know, make sure everybody's okay. But the sixth thing is that when your instinct is a, for me, because I thought there's no way people aren't injured or killed as well. I'm fine. I got to be on stage. But you know, this is obviously all encompassing and do you have any new material you're working on? I did and that's why I had to let them fend for themselves. I had to fill out. It's always about our folks. It's just a bar. Hey guy here, good to be here tonight. Where are you from sir? You look like Jersey. What was really bizarre was that we were running toilet. I said, Jim, we got to go back inside because I was afraid it was another mom, right? Because in Lebanon they used to always set off an explosion.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       The old trick was to have people run toward another explosion. Right. I know that from, you know, and my mother used to always say, be careful of that. That sounds terrible. Piece of information to carry around in your head when you were a child. It's also important. I know, it's horrible. It's hard because it's so maniacal cause it, they're trying to injure people and, and that's an old technique, right? So you, you create a small explosion, get people to run toward the bigger explosion. There's just something incredibly fucked up about people's ability to just attack and kill random people that they don't know. Well, that was playing around out that the terrorism is, the idea is to spread fear and get people to behave differently. You're not gonna win the war with big bombs, but you can get people to change their routine, their life, and the way they think.

Speaker 1:          00:05:02       And even like I told you when I was in the Chelsea market five hours before that, it was so crowded and it was so, I just great food people were at a spice market in clothing and just beautiful people and I thought to myself, I'm going to get out of here because this feels like the place that I would bomb if I was a terrorist and it was just a premonition. I'm sure a lot of people feel that way. My thinking is different because of the world we live in, so they've changed the way my energy og roughy, they changed the way I behave the way I think we know what, regardless of whether I want to admit that or not, I found myself to be nervous in that. In that, in that space, do you think that you would have had that same feeling anyway of no bomb went off or do you really think that there was a premonition or one of those things where you sort of connect to feeling like, I don't believe in premonitions.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       I mean, maybe I do if you can read signals and stuff, but that wasn't the case for me. I just said I have an act of imagination. My take on that kind of stuff is maybe, you know, it's right. I don't want say, I don't know, because there's not a goddamn way to measure it. There's no, but there are weird moments where people have weird thoughts, but just wondering if you really, yes. Well, the answer is there. There, there are two books that were, had been, this has been studied and thinking fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman. He won a Nobel Prize for economics and behavioral economics. And then, uh, in Malcolm Gladwell's book blink there are, and for that matter, Josh Waitzkin, his book, the art of learning, all three great books that I recommend to everybody because there are signals a human being, and soldiers talk about this when they've experienced a lot of IED, they get very good when their life depends on it at reading signals, the stillness in the air behavior that they can't explain.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       But why are those people acting a little bit differently? Why are the women not out? Why are the women not out? Why can't I see any women out? Why is it just men? Why are the windows being shut right now? They pick up on all these little signals and in blink and in thinking fast and slow, there are, there are things we pick up on very quickly. We just have pattern recognition. There are other things that take a long time to think about, right? So a math problem like 48 times, you know, 36 would take a long time. It's a slow process and you can't do a lot else when you're doing that. But you can recognize if somebody is running at you screaming with their eyes open and their hands up that they're probably going to do something physical to you or something. We registered these in very quickly.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       The same goes for, you know, any kind of a situation. Probably when something's about to happen, there may be a change in behavior. There may be, uh, this doesn't look right. Why does that road, why is that bump in that road that wasn't there last time? Those kinds of things that soldiers talk about. So for me, I think this was just simply the idea that I was closed in, everything was really great and I felt like I have coffee running to my body. I'm, I'm on a caffeine high, I did my yoga, I feel good. This is too good to be true. I'm going to turn around in case a bomb goes off and blows my head off that, that's more just paranoia. But in this case, after the bomb, I ran and I said to Jimmy, I said, come back inside, come back inside.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       That could be a second bomb. And he said, yeah, you're right. And so we ran back inside and they go Juran and now I go, but there was a bomb and they'd go, what? And I said, the a bomb went off and they go, well, you know that the full house sold that house. So I run on stage and the real worry was my cousins were coming to see the show and I thought that they were, you know, right there. So that's what I, so I had to kind of get myself together and do stand up and my heart was beating fast, but it was more depression. It wasn't, it was less than fear than more depression at the world. We live in that sound. So then I did stand up and in halfway through or three quarters of the way through an off duty cop who works there walked on stage cause he stopped the, the, the soldiers that came in with the machine guns.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       He said, let me get him off stage. Don't, don't raid the comedy club please. And Hope Bizarre. Yeah. So he walks on, literally walks on and I turned and I went, oh no. I just said, oh no. Cause I was confirmed. I knew something was bad, you know. And he said he took the mic out of my hand. He said, sorry folks, we have to get you out of here. And then we left. It was just depressing, man. Wow. I'm not a terrorism survivor, but I witnessed on blue. What did that feel like going on stage right after you knew that a bomb went off 800 feet away. You know, I asked Jimmy who was there and I said, well did it seem like I was nervous? He said, nope, you just went right into pro mode. You know, I've been doing it so long and I, and I, I, it was a full house and I just said, you got to get it together.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       Wow. I think, I think anybody who's been doing standup the way as long as I have or you have, I, you know, we, we'd figure our way through. You know, I probably was speaking faster. I could feel my heart beating, but it was also just, it's terrifying man. When you, when, when, when it's that real, you know, when, when, when you think about the fact that people are walking through their lives, life is hard, right? Like just accomplishing shit. Keeping yourself on the straight and narrow flossing, fucking working out, going for your dreams anymore. It was like a study. Oh I heard about that. You know, this is flossing is bullshit. Good. Cause I use a toothpick cause I'm a man. Good for you. And then, and then something, the random can happen and all those plans go out the fucking window. Yeah. That's the strangest aspect of it, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       The randomness of it. But all of a sudden these moments unexpected or introduced into the world and they change everything, you know? And we only see our, our side of it. Obviously this is happening all over the world to varying degrees. We're just so insulated from this kind of stuff that when a random act like this does happen, it's so shocking. But if this was in, you know, the worst aspects are the worst parts of the world, they're probably experiencing these kinds of things. How to daily all the time. And not only that, if you look at the great artistic expressions, like look at Picasso and take a look at what he lived through. Look at the world that those people live to. Giacometti who, you know, he made these sculptures of, um, it looks like people who have been through a holocaust to it, to a nuclear holocaust, they were very, very, you know, political commitment in the 20th century.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       It wasn't something you could not have. Right. And, and they witnessed world wars and nuclear weaponry and all kinds of things. Probably Influenza that killed 20 million people worldwide, all kinds of stuff. And they let it inform their, their artistic expression informed their behavior. Look, you've talked to a world war two veterans. I've talked to old guys. I said, what was it like when you came back? They said, you're just more serious and there's more of an urgency to get things done. You don't have as much time. Don't make sense. Yeah. And, and so the idea is to whatever happens, whatever happens, you can react in a way that it in a form of paralysis or you can allow it to kind of get you to think, I don't know, a lot of, and

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       it's such a catch 22 in many ways because our society has never been safer. It's never been easier to exist in the west, at least in America. It's never been easier, you know? I mean, we have more healthcare, we have more access to information. There's less violent crime, there's less. Everything. Cars are safer. There's so much. But because of that, every little thing gets blown out of proportion. That's right. Things like this is horrible as they are are a wakeup call. I remember in nine 11 right after nine 11 like within the next year, we filmed fear factor in Manhattan and everyone was so nice. Everyone was so nice. It was really fascinating. It's like everyone was happy and they were so nice and they were so happy when they saw cops and firemen, firemen and cops were fucking superheroes for like a good solid two years like they should be.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       If people had perspective like, Hey, there's a bunch of people that are there to save your life, you should be so thankful and happy that there as opposed to, oh my God, I saw that guy that hits the ball with a stick. He's amazing. Yeah. I was sweating when I was near him. There were fucking crazy man. We are crazy and as soft as things get, when they get softer things get more and more added. A perspective like that Matt Leblanc story that we're talking about before the podcast folks, this is like the height. This is the height of the craziness of people getting upset at fucking nothing. I'm gonna give you the height right now. Re pull that, pull that up. Cause this is, this is so classic example of people who lose perspective on what really matters. They just, they don't have any real existential threats out there to their own lives and their way of life.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       So they have to find an enemy. And this is a classic example of being outraged at something you shouldn't be outraged by. Here's the article. It says Matt Leblanc was disgusting on the Emmy's red carpet and can leave showbiz now. Now in this person's defense, the author, I have no idea if that is what she actually wrote as her actual title because I know that editors change things and you know, they try to make things more inflammatory and if it's so much easier to make something more inflammatory when it's, you're an editor and you take someone's work and you add some stuff to it, you add a title to it. Who knows if that's what happened. Just to, just to clarify, because that is a possibility. So this is what he says. Um, they're talking to, he's on the red carpet with a, the, the woman from game of thrones, Emilia Clarke, who plays a Khaleesi, right? Yeah. And she says he's objectifying women, but let me, he's got disgusting characteristics. Let's just say his, his, his actual statement, he goes, I saw the first season, then kind of fell out of touch with it. And I guess that's when she started getting naked. So I need to catch up. That's it. Yes. All he said. Yeah. So I would say in a, that's all he

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       said. And he is a comedic actor. He's doing an interview. He's trying to be funny. That's right. He's just being silly. I mean, I think Dan was like the nicest, most polite way of being pervy I've ever read. But she called him, she called him and he shares some of his characters. Disgusting, disgusting characteristics like objectifying women. So that's, that's, that's why, what is her name, the woman who said that? It's unbelievable. So her name is, uh, Lauren holter. I wonder really with people like this, you're right. I wonder what their historical perspective is on things. We've come a long fucking way and I mean, in women's rights and you know, Obama had a great speech that I listened to listen to it. [inaudible] 2016 he gave it to Howard College, which is a black college. And yes, yes, there are, there are race issues by Obama said, yeah, I'm going to say some controversial things were all way better off.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       And Oh, by the way, uh, so our race relations when I graduated in 1983, it was a lot harder and there are more opportunities. And to not give the that credit, and then I'm give to not suggest that we are better off. It doesn't mean there doesn't mean you get complacent and it doesn't mean there isn't work to do, but please understand that there we have come a long way. And to not give credit for that. It's not give credit to the foot soldiers that did all that work from 1983 until now, many of whom were people of color. So when you say, you know, it's things that never been worse, you're wrong. You don't have historical perspective. And I'll give you another perspective that New York Times had this interesting editorial and whether this is true or not, but if you define war as countries going to war over territory, resources with national armies, five out of six people on this globe are not living in countries at war.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       One in six are in conflict, uh, war torn areas. And those, those areas go from Nigeria to Pakistan. Now, uh, that's, that is a large part of the globe, primarily in Middle East, primarily the Muslim world. That area is in strife and at war and there's a lot of tragedy. But please keep in mind, that's one in six people in the globe, Latin America in the 70s and the 80s, our lifetime, we're military dictatorships. Nicaragua was a communistic t and not even a communist dictator, but it was a communist country where there was a huge insurgency, huge wars being fought, insurgencies, lots of death. Uh, no democracy whatsoever. Latin America has a lot of problems, but let me tell you, at least they are run by civilian governments as corrupted as they may be. That's big progress. So you've got to kind of measure, you've got to measure where progress has been made, give it credit and, and then don't let that make you complacent because there's always work to do. But at least give it credit. I completely agree with you, but I think you're giving her statement way too much credit. I agree. I think what she's doing brought in Pakistan and Nigeria falls. I mean, I think she's probably laughing that were ridiculous. We're studying

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       what's obviously like a clickbait bullshit. Yeah, you're right. I mean it's, you're right. She's looking to be outrage. She's got to write a story. This is a story here. I got something here. Let's run with it. Yeah. I mean that's what a lot of what's going on with these internet sort of website stories. That's a lot of it is just, I just took the bait at night. Well, there's a lot of fake ones. I mean, you've seen fake ones and it just completely fake to some make up a story. They made up a story about, um, me disarming some person at the comedy store, some person with a gun, and I got a text from a buddy of mine who's a cop and he's like, did you, did you take out a, uh, you know, God, congratulations. That's very difficult to do. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?

Speaker 3:          00:18:27       And people ask me if you had actually killed a mountain lion with your bare hand. And I was like, absolutely. How much money do you think they could make for those fixed stories? I mean, what do they, is it real money in that a click, a couple hundred bucks or something? Probably not. I'm not under probably just a way of getting attention, but there's, there used to be, used to be like the onion, the onion would say shit. That was, you would read the headline and go, ah, and then you would read what you knew to be satire. You knew parrot, you knew that would be fake was funny. It was absurd. Now there's a bunch of websites that have taken with them. They'd done and made it way less obvious that they're trying to be funny. Yeah. It's just weird. But that, but I do think that we live in a time and there's probably kind of a blow back now.

Speaker 3:          00:19:13       It's interesting, but we do live in a time where people are just way too sensitive and it's, and it's certain loud mouths in the media. I mean, when Alec Baldwin wrote an article saying, I think I quit and it was like he was leaving Hollywood. He, no, he's done so much for gay rights and he's always been a really liberal guy. But he called the guy a cock sucker because the guy ended up taking pictures of him and his wife and then you know, and I guess they consider that to be homophobic and he got just lambasted by, you know, fucking, you know, the sort of lunatic fringe. But it was really bad and it hurt his feelings and he was like, you guys are pointing your guns at that wrong enemy. I'm not your enemy, I'm your advocate. But you're so you're so caught up on your power trip.

Speaker 3:          00:19:54       It's what happens to any group, any like Greenpeace is a good example. The guy used to be part of Greenpeace said, look, we've got a lot of stuff done. But there were a lot of people that weren't willing to let it go because, and they needed a new closet in new costs cause they were addicted to the power. It wasn't so much about saving the whales anymore. It was about the fact that they, they had a sense of identity and they had power and they could really shake things up and cause good people who were involved in doing good work to have to stop and go, Huh, why? Well that's what a lot of people are doing by writing blogs, whether they realize it or not, that's what they're doing. You're trying to claim your own space by jumping in and trying to get a reaction.

Speaker 3:          00:20:35       And in that case that Matt Leblanc cake case, it's one of the most obvious blatant in bizarre what like if that really, that captivates a moment of your time other than laughing or not laughing at that moment. Right. First of all, let's break down what he's saying he needs to catch up because uh, she started getting naked. Are we supposed to pretend that we don't like looking at her naked? Is that is so a man standing next to a woman who has been paid to be naked on television show? Was he supposed to pretend that that's not an enjoyable thing to look at? How I get, I get confused because if a woman is standing next to a man and says the exact same thing, I guarantee you no one gives a fuck course. And everyone might laugh if amy Schumer said that next to a Brad Pitt, what if he said this?

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       What if he had said, I'm not going to watch it? Uh, uh, she takes her clothes off and it objectifies women and I, and I refuse to actually, I'm afraid I may enjoy it if I watch it. And so out of respect for her and her privacy, even though she's taking off her clothes and, and it's an artistic expression and a great TV show, I don't approve because I don't think women should take their clothes off now. Now you're a pure, now you're puritanical. Do you really want to live in a world like that? Because I'll tell you something. There are a lot of countries, a lot of countries like for example, Saudi Arabia and a lot of other countries that are, you know, not, not the, not at the forefront of women's rights that would, uh, we'd be outraged and wouldn't let you see that and would censor that.

Speaker 3:          00:22:04       So what are we talking about here? What are we talking about? We're talking about a joke that objectifies women. Have you seen that Cosmo, the two comparisons of the cosmo covers one of them, it says why men who objectify women are the effing worst. And then in the next one, it's all about men's packages in bikinis. Really. Just their cocks in became, it's great. I mean, it is literally just an object. It's not even a full person could just focusing on Cox in Bikinis, same magazine. But what, what do you mean by objectify women? What does that mean? It doesn't mean anything. I think women that are naked or beautiful, well objectifying, treating them as objects instead of people. Well, I'm not trying to start a relationship with her. I'm trying to look at her naked in dragon movie. Yeah. You know, she rides dragons around, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       It's a dragon lady. She's the mother, right? Yeah. Mother of dragons. Yeah. I'm trying to look at her naked. Is that okay? If you don't want me to look at her naked, how about you don't show it is, oh look at that wealth by the way. 36 silver Olympic bulges that deserve gold and it's all just dicks. Just hogs in Bikini was in men's kidneys. This is awful. This is so silly. And they're looking at just raised. But the other one confirmed dot. Dot. Men who objectify women are effing horrible. So it's a woman looking straight at the camera. I like, she's like, girl, you know it's true. I'm going to fucking tell you. And you know, and the other girls got to be like, fuck yeah, them pieces of shit men. And look at the guy in the background. They couldn't have picked a douchey or looking guy. He looks, I'm sure pissed Aspen. And by the way, he's got his, he's so beaten down. He's got a sheet over his head. The poor guy pop out. He's got his clothes on. So does she, and they were under the covers. This is a disaster of a relationship. It has nothing to

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       do with the men objectifying women. You if he objectifies women, how the fuck did he trick you to the point where you're both with no clothes on or with clothes on under the covers. What is going on here? What cc you're making poor choices as well. Yeah, I see. When I think about objectifying women, I think about this like I think about, uh, you know, cause I think it's great. I've been to strip clubs, I've, I've paid money to watch girls, uh, take their clothes off. Maybe I've even been moaning to him. Essentially girls, I dunno Joe, there's a lot of people are listening and I have children. Here's the point. Here's the point. When I was younger. Um, but I think when I think of objectifying women, yeah. Cause me, I'm, I'm a, you can call me a feminist in terms of like, if you can do the job, I don't give a fuck once you look like, you know, um, but for me, objectifying women I suppose would be, well, she's got a, she's just good for banging.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       She's, that's just three holes or two holes depending on what you're into. Treating them as a nonperson. Yeah. And then, and then of course, uh, dialing them up and not really allowing them to realize their potential. Maybe supporting policies or thoughts that don't sort of, um, allowing them to do that. I can understand how women have suffered from that and continue to, I get it, you know, Russia and they talk about what it's like to be a woman in Russia. And I, I know that there are issues like that, but come on, man, humor is really important in including humor that objectifies women. It's fucking important. It's, it just makes it less of an issue. I think

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       it really does. Well, it completely depends upon what is the humor, what is the joke, what is the context? It's, there's a long, broad range of of variables. When we talked about comedy material and that quote Unquote objectifies women, but that a flippant off the cuff humorous remark at some sort of a ridiculous little red carpet interview thing. You know those things, those things are ridiculous. The will, you have to apologize. Oh God, I hope he doesn't. I hope he doesn't, but he works. He's a working actor. He's not comedian. See working actors are always subject to the will of people that are out there that are looking to hire people. You're always going to have to audition. You're always going to have to get approved. When Matt Leblanc is up for things is probably a few other guys that are like really high profile guys that are up for it too. And if one of them is involved in some sort of scandal or some, someone thinks that they're objectifying women and their effing horrible, they should leave show business if that catches any momentum, this horrible things that people have done right. Like admittedly horrible that they themselves just fell apart like Kramer. Right. Perfect example. That was a career killer that killed that guy. Yup. Like from then on he is not the same guy. No, there's does just that was a a monster whopper awful thing that went down

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       so which I'm more sympathetic to because if you made that mistake, if you did that, if you made that mistake, you better be ready for the consequences. That was offensive. Right? I mean I think he had an outburst. He had a moment but you, you can't have, it's like saying I had an a moment and I punched that guy in the face, then stomped him in the head and he can't walk the same. Everybody has moments where you want to do certain things but you got to pay the price for that. I also think, and this is a complete a rumor, but this is what I had heard was that cocaine was involved. Now if that's true, it may not have been if it, if it wasn't, I apologize. Legal Shit out of the way. If cocaine was involved, people that are on coke get ridiculously confident and they say ridiculous shit.

Speaker 3:          00:27:29       That just does not jive with everyone around them because the other people around them aren't on coke. They're not on coke in, especially if you're on coke, it seems like you're all about yourself. It seems like it becomes a very sort of a selfish, isolated little sort of environment protecting, you know, wasn't sure. Certainly that's what I'm saying, but I'm saying he thought he could get away with that. He thought he could talk like that and who knows what they had said to him. I don't know. You know, the whole thing was him getting frustrated. The fact that he's really just not a very good comic and he was getting heckled and we're saying, you're not funny. This isn't funny. Yeah. The, when someone tells you you're not funny. And I've had it happened to me, I've had someone tell me, oh not funny when I was bombing and you agree with them, it's like there's nothing you can do.

Speaker 3:          00:28:12       You agree with them. And so I think with Kramer was trying to do is hurt their feelings and that was how he thought he could hurt their feelings. I'm sure. I don't think that he's, I don't think he's a racist. He's like, I, I if you said to cram, if you think that because people have more melanin in their skin, they should be, you know, Blah Blah Blah. I don't think that's how he thinks. I don't think he's that dumb. And I don't think, but again, again that that's hey, that's like the Mel Gibson thing to look when you get drunk or you're on blow or whatever. If you then decide that the Jews are the reason everything sucks and you shout shouting that to a Jewish cop, uh, or, or that you know, you hope your girl gets, you know, has had, is forced to have sex with in the 19 black theaters.

Speaker 3:          00:29:00       But using the n word. I don't, I've never look, I, you know, I've never really had those kinds of out that this is kind of me man. It's also kind of like it's called. So it's also, what's the other word? Um, it's blatantly fucking racist page. Well, you live in a world where you just can't say that Shit, man. It's the words of a crazy person. Yes. Because as times goes on and you become older and you meet more people, you realize there are a bunch of variables when it comes to people's behavior and what they do. But those variables are usually based on culture, on economics, on the society that they live in, the family they grew up with. And you're going to meet people that

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       you love, that fill all of the blanks. Asian, Caucasian, European. You're going to meet people you love that are all in there because they're just extraordinary people and you're going to meet people that are fucking cunts and they're going to be in all those things too. There's just no way around that folks. And if you start siding on one gender or one race or one patch of dirt, your fucking missing the whole thing. The whole thing is we are globally one super organism that does not have the ability yet to communicate in real time across the board with each other in a, in an incredibly honest way. We can't really do that yet. You could speak a certain amount of languages if you're a fucking super wizard and you can figure your way through a lot of countries if you know their cultures, but they're not necessarily gonna understand ours unless they can read our fucking minds.

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       We all speak to any different languages. We live in too many different places. We're so used to one way of life that anything, any variations, any breakups, and then one way of life throws everything into a fucking tizzy and no one knows what to do about it. Whereas the rest of the world is experiencing all sorts of different strife. I was watching this show the other day called uncharted and this guy was a, I've taught, I've talked about this before, but it's just, it was so harsh to watch. He, his name's Jim shockey and he goes to all these really remote villages and stays with the local people. And in this one they were getting killed by crocodiles. Oh yeah. These people are going to the river and every time they would go to the river, they would have to set up these nets and the crocodiles, they target people.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       So when a crocodile starts targeting people, they have to go and shoot it. And everyone in the village was fucked up, man. Everyone in the village was losing his missing him blends three fucking third or fourth person at a giant bite taken out of them. It's crazy. And they just live right next to this river and they survive off that river. Did they live in these little huts and shit and he's thinking like you are complaining about the wispy joke might not have been the best joke, but I would have laughed if I was there. Sure. If he said that, I would have shot that with silly and the fact that we're trying to pretend that this is some sort of an outrage and that this person she defending, who is she trying to defend here? What is she trying to do it that. That's the other thing.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       It's more about her though situation. Well, it's recreational outrage. It's a thing that people are doing. It's a thing that people are, that's great. That's, I've never heard that. I love that expression. It's recreational outrage. Recreational outreach. They have decided to be out. If your outrage at that, that is really filling up your time like I am going to fuck this terrorist attack. I am not as Lama phobic. I am not writing about the terrorist attack. I am going to write about Matt Leblanc being a piece of shit. Yeah, he should leave the now he's the problem. He's the, he's the problem. It wasn't a bomb went off. I went and well Matt Leblanc is sexist. Here's the thing. Stop saying the worst. Everybody. Everybody stopped saying the worst because that is like that. There's no better symbol of our sheltered time than people saying the worst. I was reading this account of how certain people were tortured with these to skin them alive with sea shells.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       They would take like an oyster shell and they would skin these people alive. They would tie them down and skin them alive with oyster shell. It's got to feel good. Yeah, so that's the worst. Yeah. That would be the worst. That's the worst. Not I'm with you on that. I would have to say that that would be the worst. It's the worst. I think a good way. You know another, here's a question really is there's this tendency that we all have, right? So when this guy, you find this guy who fucking bomb people in Chelsea and you, you, you want him to die or you want him to go to jail forever and I hope he suffers and all that. The the, the way to look. There's another way to look at things which might be not only more helpful, but might lead us to better solutions.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       And I don't know if this is true, but that's a good way to look at human beings. We all have the same hardware. There's been a lot of science, a lot of work on this. You know, we have a lot of, we, we basically have the same hardware. Um, if you look at the way human beings are, if you draw through lines, even with cultures that have been not very, not exposed to a lot, but there's been a lot of work done on, regardless if you're a highlander in Papa New Guinea or you're northern European, you know, senator have, you know, a member of government and you've been exposed to a lot. We recognize certain things. Um, most cultures have a tradition of humorous in salts. Uh, human beings. It's seems innately can tell the difference between joy and discussed. Um, and happy and sad.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       We have, we essentially have the same hardware. It's why you can't really look at someone's skin or if someone's racial features and you know, realize what they're capable of. Well, what could that guy be a scientist? Well, he's black. He couldn't be because there aren't a lot of stuff. You just can't do that. And we all know that. So really what it is is software culture. What you have been exposed to, your belief system, what you've been told is true. What you've been told is right. What you've been told is good versus evil. That is, uh, essentially what motivates people to do good and bad things. You know, Freud said that man goes to war because he hates people well or he, that he has a lot of aggression, hatred. Well, there are a lot of other scholars would say, maybe not. In fact, men don't go to war out of hatred.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       They go to war out of love. They go to war because they love the country. They are defending. They go to war under symbols and propaganda. They go to war under and for an idea that they are defending because men and countries define themselves along the lines along certain lines that they are. If you think about any man, we all have a line and we all have a line that we're willing to, at least in our mind, that we're willing to defend with our lives. Probably at the front door of our house if somebody coming in and try to get to our kids, but certainly our country and this country is very nationalistic. If you start talking about, you know, um, you Americans get very nationalistic, have you started making, you know, making fun of the flag? There it is. Look at that flag. Hey, it's Dan. Hey. So it's better sometimes to think to yourself, I wonder what kind of software went into this, this guy's head, this guy who just did the bombings in New York? What kind of software was he exposed to? Obviously it wasn't good software and it might make us, I don't know if compassion is the word, but it might make us more understanding. And so if you understand your enemy or the enemy, which may not be people, but rather an ideology, maybe that's the best way to then fight it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:17       I always try to look at perspective as like a large creation that's made with little tiny lego blocks. And with every life experience that I have, I try to add a few more lego blocks and they might not change me radically. But over time, those lego blocks can build and become a significant structure. Something that you could see and look at and measure. That's cool. And every time one of these things happens, I always try to think of a, there's perspective that I had when, uh, when my kids start walking and talking to them and seeing them go from coming out of their mother's body to being a little person I could talk to, I started realizing, okay, it seems like my thought was always that people were static, that I meet, you know, Mike McGee and he's 32 years old. Hey Mike, how are ya?

Speaker 2:          00:37:09       Nice to meet you. This is Mike McKee. He's 32. Mike was a baby at one point in time. It came out of his mother's body and help us a little thing like all of us did. And then through all sorts of weirdness, life experiences that are completely random and people that probably were totally unqualified teaching them things and growing up with a bunch of other kids that were similar in a lot of ways, similarly getting fucked up by their parents and their upbringing and their religion and their, uh, uh, a million different variables. Right? And then there's all these alpha chimpanzee jockeying positional things that go on in these relationships with kids and kids bully kids. And sometimes those kids that are bullied, it ruins them for the rest of their life and they just, they're devastated for like literally to the grave from some shit that happened when they were 10.

Speaker 2:          00:37:56       So we're, we're subject to so many different variables and so many different points of data entry. Like data can come at us in so many different ways was his physical data, whether it's just reading the news and trying to understand like why would someone go to a nightclub in Orlando and just start shooting gay people? Why would someone drive a truck in, in France and just drive over those people? Why would someone do that? I'm like, what? What is that was a baby at one point in time, something has led to that and we have to look at all the things that influence us, all of them, whether it's behavioral things, whether it's things that are were beaten into you by just life's hard lessons. And then the big one that nobody wants to discuss. Ideologies. Yeah, call them whatever you want. You want to call them religions, you want to call them cults, calm, whatever you want.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       But at the bottom line is they're incredibly structured patterns of behavior that you are forced to follow. That can be real dangerous if people don't follow them. And nobody wants to admit that. Nobody wants to admit that when you leave this pattern of behavior, you're supposed to be killed. No one wants admitted. If you vary from this pattern of behavior and do no one any harm like homosexuals, you're, you're to be killed. I mean, there's some really, and you know, oh, this is, this Islamophobia on this show has got to stop. I'm scared of rats, scared a lot of dogs. So let me just tell you what, I'm scared of. Scare a lot of people. I'm scared of questions. I'm scared. I'm scared of, uh, ex cons. I'm scared of pis and vans driving around. I was scared of clowns. It's kind of a lot of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       So this, this idea of being, having a phobia over a, you know, a particular ideology or I'm fuck me over pattern recognition to you. You, you, you can pattern, right? Will you stay alive by being able to recognize patterns? Yeah. And it's the, but the important aspect of it is, and this is always what's important, is that most people that are practicing that on hurting anybody, right? Most people that are practicing Muslims aren't hurting anybody because there's so many of them. If they were, if there was a war between Muslims and Christians and would just spilling out into the streets every day, Jesus Christ would be a blood bath everywhere, every one in a million, 300 million Muslims, I think it would be insane. So the, the, the problem is not a particular ideology in much in as much as it's a particular strain of the ideology, whether it's a Christian that goes to an abortion clinic with a fucking high powered rifle and starts taking people out, whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:40:26       Somebody who has the thinks they have the truth with a capital t, which is called a fundamentalist. And we're all fundamentalists. You know, we all have aspects of our personalities and our belief systems that are fundamentalists. If you asked me about sugar, I'll wax poetic. I'll tell you all about the evils of sugar. And I really believe I'm right now, I have a lot of data and science behind me, but I, you know, I have all kinds of ideas about why sugar is bad and fat and protein is good for you because you know, I've lived in and I've done it and I'm sure you have your own point of view. I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich today and it was damn good and it was damn good and you didn't hurt anybody, including you probably didn't hurt yourself. So sometimes cause you're not a fundamentalist cause every now and then.

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Thank you. Thank you. Some milk. Ooh, it was good. But the other glass of milk I hope has raw milk. Raw cause you're going to want, but I love raw milk. Raw milk is the shit. I get the rock coat milk from Erewhon and coat deep. You know you can get to hold it. Hold on your horses and I think it's about $35. I've never bought it. But you can get camel milk. Whoa. Oh yeah. What? Talk about the Middle East. The Bedouin famed for their sexual prowess lived on camel milk. Do you mean milk like as in titty milk or sucking cocks? No, no, no. I'm talking about, God dammit. No, I meet titty milk. Almond Milk Crates, wink. Wait, go man. I'm not talking about Dick Milk. I'm talking about, I'm not talking about guy cream. You fuck. I'm talking about fucking camel milk from their utters in a Australia day hunt camels and the, they have no, like Australia is kind of a crazy place and Australia, New Zealand are very similar in that they don't really have any natural predators because they were, they were separated from the rest of the planet when that whole Pangea thing happened.

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       So all they have is like they have crocodiles, but crocodiles are, for the most part, they only get things that are really stupid. They get things that are, that are forced to go through rivers. That's what they get. They get things through to close to the water. Guys are fishing in waist deep water, but they have so many animals that crocodiles are just not going to get like Kangaroos. They're not going to kill all the Kangaroos. It's just not going to happen. So they have to bring in people to kill camels. That's crazy. They have to bring in people to kill a lot of on camels are indigenous to Australia or where they brought their, they were brought there. Here's what's crazy man. All the animals were brought there. They tried to turn Australia and New Zealand into some incredible hunting destination for old school. He rich dudes and like the 18 hundreds really?

Speaker 2:          00:42:46       Yeah. They totally violated the all the laws of ecosystem. No, that, yeah, because they brought these animals over and they didn't bring over companion predators. So you have wild stags where they've never had any Predator Chai. They're roaming through the woods and you know how to take care of them. They fly overhead with helicopters and gun them down and let them rot. Really? Yeah. They have to control the population. They literally sometimes are forced with some of these animals to gun them down and just leave them there. It's delicious meat. They don't have a problem with me. They have a surplus of me. You know? Most of the venison that we get is from New Zealand. When you get elk, it's from New Zealand and they brag about it. And New Zealand elk filet. Yes. Yeah. Colorado's right there. Like how was it? What the fuck is going on over there?

Speaker 2:          00:43:32       I tell you what's going on over there. No mountain lions. No bears, no wolves, no coyotes. And know people, put a couple of families, wolves out there. It was, it just kill the shit out of everything. I leave till the shit out of everything. It's like, Hey, let's have some fun today. There was an interesting story that I posted, um, a couple of days ago that I read on one of the, um, I think, uh, uh, one of them outdoorsy type websites, but it was about a guy talked about how his dog got killed by wolves and that he wasn't mad at the walls. He found his dog's head. He couldn't find the dog and she was like 18 years old German shepherd. And he went walking, trying to find her and then found her head and it was like, oh my God, who did that? Why would anybody do that?

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       He thought it was a person, like some crazy serial killer. And then he realizes he got further on a lot of evidence of a wolf attack. If you've ever seen, you know what a wolf does? We came pawn, I'm a wolf calf that had been killed, not a wolf cafe, a moose calf, others that had been killed by wolves in, um, in Canada when I was there about a year and a half ago. It was actually two years ago now. Um, and it was really weird because I didn't expect to see all the hair and I was like, Oh yeah, of course they'd have to like get rid of the hair. Yeah. Well they say spit it up and they chew it up. But it was, I always just thought like when you would find a carcass, then it'd be just like torn apart. It's not just torn apart like Harry's everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:44:53       Yeah. It's like all over [inaudible] balm. Yeah. Yeah. Did you see, I have that picture up there. See if you could find the moose calf killed by a, I've seen that. Have you seen that in living in the wild? What? Did you see? A hair everywhere? Um, I can't remember. I saw, I saw it was something in Topanga Canyon. Actually we are coyote gets a hold of a um, a rabbit and there was right in Topanga, there was a deer that had been killed by a mountain lion. Whoa. Bones. And look at that. Look at all that hair. It's like a, like a blanket of hair. That's crazy. Like hey in the bottom of a farmer or a barn or something. But look, they had chewed all the meat off the face. Everything. Hazing. It's from a night. It's from 96 weeks ago. Wow. Look at that fucking picture.

Speaker 2:          00:45:42       That, it's crazy. We found that because of crows crows were, yeah, we were walking down this road and these crows started circling overhead and my friend Mike Hawk Ridge, he's like, let's go see what they're squawking about. So you don't want to walk with your dog on trails then in Wolf territory? Well you know what man? Wolves for the most part we'll avoid people. A dog usually means just people. But if the dog gets crazy and goes chasing after him gets away, they'll take that thing out. And even if they're not even trying to eat it, they might take it out. Cause it's a competing Predator, right? Like I'm, I'm reading this Dan Flores book, um, called the coyote America and it's all about, I found out about them from Rinella, his podcast. He was Vanillas, I'm a natural history professor, I think. You think he's a, he's, he's a, either a wildlife historian, one of those.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       But his whole deal is, I'm studying the history of an animal in a certain part of the world is coyote book is fucking fast. And why, what, what does he talk about? First of all, they're all the same thing. Coyotes or wolves. Yeah, they're all wolves. So like when people would talk to them about these coy wolves, those coy wolves would probably like a red wolf or an eastern wolf. Fuck the coyote and that thing. Fuck the coyote. Wow. And they're all like, like 20%. Yeah. There's like 10% wove and 20% well there, there's not like a 50 50 thing going on. There's like all these crazy inner breeds. And the bottom line is they're all the same animal. All wolves is Haman. Not only that, all canines emanated in North America. How about this? All horses evolved in North America, including the same from the US.

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       They came from the Asian steppes. I thought so too. They all have, they all made it over there millions of years ago from America. Here's the really fucked up thing. They don't know why they went extinct in America. Horse has started in America when extinct in America thrived in other parts of the world and were reintroduced to America. That's so weird. It's crazy. Yeah. And I showed the video of me being surrounded by coyotes. No, I'll start it yet. Um, can you sound Jamie and I'll play it and let me, let me try to find it. Yeah. But the, the point being is that there's this really nutty history that I had no idea about. All of these animals, jackals in Africa emanated from North America, started out as canines here. Those fucking things spread everywhere. I've Seen Fox, uh, and, and uh, here in California when I was hiking and I've seen Bobcat, I've seen Fox in Colorado, but I've seen bobcats out here.

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       But here's the deal. The, the really crazy thing about coyotes versus a, any of these other animals, because the fact that gray wolves were like their competitors, they're the bigger dog. They used to kill them. They developed all these different methods of staying alive. And one of them is when they scream out, you know that that's a role call. That's what they're doing. They're really roll call. Yeah. Because some shit's gone down. Maybe they've killed something. We want to make sure everybody's around. And when someone's missing, when someone doesn't respond, it goes missing. The female produces more pups in her litter significantly. Yeah. There's some sort of a biological effect when one goes missing and she can go from four if it's a healthy population to like 16. So here's, here's what, how they, one of the ways that they know that this is a fact that these wolves are capable of doing this is that when they introduced wolves to yellowstone, wolves hadn't been in yellowstone since they eradicated them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       Right? So these people came across North America, killed all these wolves. And the way they would do it is through using their system of uh, communicating and using their, um, the fact that they're there, these tight knit groups and these packs and their families and they stick together. So they would kill one wolf rub. It's sent all over a carcass, inject the carcass of a horse who would shoot a horse and Jack the horse would strychnine so that way they're killing two birds with one stone right there. We're getting rid of the wild horses, which had become a real problem. And they are still a problem today. Like wild horses. They kill wild horses in America all the time. Yeah, I didn't know that either, dude. It's nuts. And the fact that there's thousands, tens of thousands of wild horses in North America right now to the point where they're the thousands, tens of wild horses in America. There are people that are advocating for the hunting season of wild horses. I'm real. Yeah, that's a lot of meat. It's a lot of meat. It's like an elk. Yeah. It's funny because if you'd shot, that'd be a great deal of protest properly. Cause we know horses, we ride them. It's like dogs man. Yeah. Yeah. But these animals all started here. It's really bizarre. That is so strange there. This he gets into on Renell's podcast, the mass extinctions that occurred somewhere in the range

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       of the last ice age and maybe some time even before that, some of them and how, how little they know about what killed mall cat. And there's all this speculation. Is that the eye, there's speculation that when the buffalo, you know started to go extinct, they had already started. Well apparently the native Americans that were on horseback and we're riding and with followed the buffalo were killing. They weren't like that sustainable with their practices. Yes. Well this was when they started hunting with rifles on horseback was rifles. So this is all Dan Flores. This is he, he advocates the, the possibility, not advocates but he brings up the possibility that they could have possibly extra painted those animals from there. Their areas just based on rifles and horsebox without the market meat farm. So they're marketing beings, market hunting. When when they started market hunting that's when everything went fucked up.

Speaker 3:          00:51:26       Cause they would kill apparently thousands and thousands of buffaloes and just cut the tongue's out. Really? Yup. Why? Cause the tongues were worth money. People like to eat buffalo tongues. It's like a delicate one. I will not eat brain or tongue. I can't find my coyote. Steph. I'm sorry. That's all right. Let's put it down. I can't find, I, I can't eat tongue or brain. I'm down for either. It doesn't, I like things really. Tom. Oregon's. I don't need Oregon's either. I'm not into kidney. You ate liver. I, I'll eat liver. But even liver I eat because you know I'm there and I'm not sure what men, yeah, let's eat liver. But overall, fuck off. Fuck off with your organs. I'll eat heart heart's not bad. That road deer I killed in London, in England and I would shoot and things in London. It was ridiculous. But he's got, my friend has so much property, has to kill 21 dear.

Speaker 3:          00:52:17       He has to kill 21 deer on his property every year. Wow. That's how rich he is. Yeah. And uh, so she ate it. Yeah, we ate it. And it was the crunchiest and it made me sick and the warden said, hey, that's a road dear. You got to hang that for three weeks. Could you just skin it, cut it up and eat it with a good glass of wine? I was like, yeah. He goes, no, no, not with that kind of mean. What's wrong with the meat? It's, and I'm not exaggerating, it's crunchy. Like, like, like um, like the way you would if you just cut it up and put it in a plant and fried it with butter. It crunches almost like a carrot. How about that? Yeah. That's how hard the meat is. Why? Huh? That's why he got to hang it for three weeks and let it break down.

Speaker 3:          00:53:06       You cannot eat that deer meat like that. It's a Roe. Deer heard that before. Well I, I would imagine deliver that tastes like that word crunches. And the same thing with this, and I'm talking about the muscle meat. The Muslim, we both got sick. I was, I wasn't right for three days. Really. My buddy wasn't ready for a week and the game warden was like, you got to hang that. That's a road dear. You got to hang that. Somebody I'm sure knows about this, but Zana practice hanging meat is oh three waiting for things to rot minimum of three weeks. I know a lot of guys who do that in their frigerator they do their own version of a dry age age. Yeah. Yeah. You're putting it on like a flat tray with like a Napkin underneath it. Fucking delicious. By the way. Fucking Galicia. It's so weird.

Speaker 3:          00:53:54       When you go to the butcher, if you ever go to whole foods and you pass by the butcher, you can look in that window into that dry aging room and just look at rock. Like my kids were like, what the fuck is that? I'm like, that is um, that's rot. It's on the, on the outside of the meat. They're going to cut that away and yeah, that's what it looks like. Cheese cheese is just full of mold and cheese is full of mold, but it does. We don't identify with cheese, no cheese, just some foreign substance. When you look at that steak, like you understand that that's supposed to be red, like meet amazing as it's a bizarre practice. Five day dry look at it, starting to shrivel up. God, it's weird. Right down. Break it then fuck it is weird. Right? It's weird that people figured that out.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Yeah, I didn't know that about roe deer. So they must be like super muscular or something. There's not a lot of meat and they're small and they're heart. It's not, you shouldn't and you're not, you don't feel very good. It's like the size of a fucking, you know, like a midsize dog. Shit, I'm going to lose like a collie and plus they're not really hot. It's, I didn't know what was really going on. It was nibbling away and it wasn't, you know, I was like, aw man. I had this, I had this $15,000 a German, a sniper rifle. It's called a Blouser, I think. Blouser Lahser and uh, and I had a, and he had, I was d I shot at standing up, I had a stand. You saw the video and you know, listen, it wasn't very far away. If dude, there's a video apparently this thing of roe deer and it goes back to the same thing we were talking about with um, Australia not having any natural predators.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       These roe deer, they bring in snipers to take them out in England. High speed video footage where they blow their heads off their brother heads off with plastic bullets. Oh, I didn't know that. The plastic, yeah, these plastic bullets. Yeah, because I saw that guess plastic bullets just don't make it through there and hit anything else. Like once they hit that, it probably just explodes. Yeah. But the heads explode. I mean, have you seen it? I'd like to see like a child's toy. You know those child's toys that you squeeze and the eyes poked out of the head like that. I was like, well yeah, that's what's sick is that I've not only seen it many times, I've thought about it, you know, as recently as a week ago, you have to think about it. It's just like a crazy thing that here's this deer moving around and then here's its head exploded and anything would happen to the human being does and they have to do it or those things will overpopulate. So it's like either that or do you, I'm sure you've seen that video because it was

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       really interesting video, how wolves change rivers. It was about the yellowstone wolves being reintroduced into yellowstone and how they've changed the course of the rivers because they've killed deer, which allowed these plants to grow that didn't grow before and change the course of the re. Yeah, really interesting stuff. Really interesting stuff about the reintroduction of wolves. But it's essentially what biologists were trying to do by reintroducing wolves was introduced, uh, a natural ecosystem because this is how it's supposed to be. There's not supposed to be like the hunters got upset because all of a sudden these, uh, elk herds are devastated and there's like 50% of them. But in many ways it's kind of like a selfish feeling because although I side with them and I understand what they're saying, I don't want to wolves to be a problem with people, but they are, they're a part of that whole thing.

Speaker 2:          00:57:13       They were there when the elk were there. There's never elk without the wolf. And when there are elk without the wolf, you get what you got to New Zealand, yet people flying overhead with helicopters, gutting them down and sletten the meats. No top Predator. Right. And it's, it also feels fucked up. Like if you, if you were over in New Zealand, we're going hunting and as we're going up the hill, man, what a beautiful countryside and let all of these animals, and then we hear a helicopter fly overhead and one one ridge over there just gone and down stacks. And we go over the top of the hill. And this is like what we're, you know, we romanticize his trip. We're going to go there. We're going to live off the land, right? We're going to take a stag. You. Thank you stag for giving me your life.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Your, your flesh will feed my meanwhile, there's a fucking helicopter just indiscriminately gunning him down because there's too many of them. Shit in the grass. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. And they just let them run up there, man. And it's a Chi being there with my knife taken off a bunch of steak and that's what we'd be doing. We'd camp right, but we'd be bummed out and we wouldn't, I wouldn't shoot an animal. I'd be like, well, I can't eat. There's no way I could justify shooting an animal. There's no way this is, there's meet here. It's just killed. We're done. Right? So we're just going to chalk this off to an experience. That's it. Just be a bit, we talk about on stage, oh, here's the deer's head. Exploded. Cute. That's very cute. When it might been a fall.

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       Is it a button by going? Good Lord has got a good shot. He shot. That's what the plastic bullet. Yeah. Apparently they use plastic bullets because they're doing them in urban environments because they're using rf suppressors, plastic bullets. And Bob Lang take it out. Yeah. Yeah. There's a place in Pennsylvania where they allow deer hunting all throughout the year because there's so many fucking deer and people set up. Tree stands in their backyards and the higher hunters or or like advertise for punters to come and shoot their deer. My mother in Connecticut, we had, she would plant flowers and she was obsessed with our flowers and the deer would come in and eat them and my mother in very soon walked into my room and said, listen to me, I'm going to buy a crossbow and you're into this shooting stuff. I want you to kill the deer. And I said, okay, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       it's very illegal though. And she says, I know so you're going to have to be very careful. I said, I know, but I think it's super early like we can get in big trouble. She said, that's not the point. I want you to kill the deer that are eating my flowers. I said, you do it. I didn't because I talked her out of it. I was like, listen, you got to put a fence over your fucking flowers because I think we could get fine like $100,000 or something crazy for your flowers and that's probably not worth it. Yeah, you can go to jail. But I know a lady, I wasn't, I didn't know how to use a crossbow. I just, I didn't know. I was like, it'd be cool. But that's the beautiful thing about crossbows. You don't have to do the learning curve super short.

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       Just as long as you're resting it on something, you don't punch the trigger. This is all you have to learn how to do it across what? Ready, Eh, Eh, don't jerk it. Don't jerk it. Cause there's an instinct to juggle. Just go like that's his goal. Glitter it out. Three quarters of the witch schoolies gently Vega all on the trigger sooner. Just moves. Chigger doesn't even know what's going on the trip. You just, just, just push, push, push, read. The real reason I didn't do it, I remember is a not because I didn't think I could do it. It was more because I figured if I shot the deer with a crossbow or a bow and Arrow, it would run and I'd have to track it and it would run into somebody else's yard. And then they'd find a deer that had a bow and Arrow and then they'd come and find, they trace it back.

Speaker 3:          01:00:41       I heard a story about a rich lady in Malibu. They may have done the exact same thing, trimming letter actually shot a fucking deer in her backyard with a crossbow. Really? Because it was eating her flowers may or may not have. Yeah. It's May or may not have. It's one of those weird stories you're hearing from other moms and you know, people talk to them. You know what Mary did? Oh, she got a chronicle meet. You know, I wouldn't do that if I could get away with it. It's good meat seat. It, it's, it's, it's a good move. It's, you know, it goes to that age old problem that a lot of us have with the idea of death. I don't want anybody to kill me and eat me, you know? So why, why do I want to kill that animal and eat that animal? And we have this very strange relationship with these animals now,

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       sort of. We've like, we've contracted all of our food collection off to other people. Yeah. And that's something that just didn't exist for most of human history. So over the last x amount of years, we've contracted all of our food acquisition. I love the fact that I could just get this plastic thing of water and I know it's legit crocodiles. I to hear this, listen, Hey, that little snap, that means nobody poisoned it. It's fresh. Yeah, it's sealed fresh from the factory. And I can have a nice glass of water. I don't have to go to a river. I didn't have to pump. I don't have to have a, well, it's, it's way better this way. But the problem is by us not being in nature at all by not interacting with animals at all. We've allowed these monsters to develop these slaughterhouses. He's houses of horror.

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       He's a factory farm mechanisms like we've really fucked up. We've gotten so big, or the cities that don't make food, need so much food on a daily basis, that we've completely removed ourselves from the process of, of growing things of, uh, of we've like, it's one of the most important things about being a person as eating healthy food. Yeah. It's one of the most important things. If you don't have healthy food, you're not going to be healthy. It's really that simple, right? Like if you eat fucking just peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like I did today, if you have that all day, every day for the rest of your life, you're gonna have a shitty short fucking life. You're not going to make it. There's not enough nutrients in that, but we don't, we don't think about it, man. We're so busy with stocks and with marriage and with fucking, I want to get, where are we going to thinking about, um, making an addition on the house.

Speaker 3:          01:03:00       No, we're going to get that man cave anytime. It's easy though. We've got, we have figured out a way to get a lot of protein in people's bodies had cheap for cheap and he used to be that meet with something that countries I remember and a lot of countries that I lived in, uh, we were like, for example, you would eat and meet twice a year, the bedouin, you know, who are very healthy people. They lived on dates and bread and, and go a camel milk and stuff. But they, the traditional indigenous people of Saudi Arabia, for example, they would eat meat twice, three, four times a year, meet with a real delicacy. It was very expensive. You'd, you'd have a goat. But it was, it was not easy to come by. There was very little water and stuff like that. So in a way we have, we've given ourselves a food problem, you know, it's just the pendulum has, we have people at eat obviously too much.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       And then you have lobbying efforts to get as much corn syrup and things like that into people's bodies. And you know, it's, it's, it's an interesting thing. I think you're right though. We've gotten away from a lot of the stuff that just is easy to do to make yourself healthy. Like sleep and water. That's a big part. Those are giant. The sleep of water, a giant. I just think we're, so, I think we're way too removed from what I think is an essential aspect of life. The process of food acquisition, I think it makes people really confused. I think, uh, you know, I could look at it as an enthusiast and I can look at it as someone who enjoys being outside. I enjoy, I enjoy the woods, I enjoy fishing and all that stuff. I enjoy catching something in the water and then cooking it and eating it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:34       I enjoy this so much. You don't have to show his money in the food business and then it good and bad. I mean, you know, I don't want to make the food companies have to be, but I was going to say is, but I don't want to do it every day and I don't want it to be the only way I can survive because it's too hard to do anything else. So we figured out a way to make it really easy to get food. The hardest part of life now becomes the easiest part of life. Well, I mean, when they talk about why did philosophy, why were the Greeks, you know, able to sit around and think, so you had plato and socrates and Aristotle. Well, you know, William McNeil I think wrote this book about the fact that, you know, the Greeks had access to timber, olive oil and wine, and they were to export those things and exchange them for goods that they needed.

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       So it meant that they didn't have to live a subsistence lifestyle. They also lived in a temperate climate, so they didn't have to spend so much time getting ready for the winter flip. Also, super busy. But fuck, they were doing a lot of butt fucking as well before there were, there were any probably diseases, but they didn't have any diseases back then. Now. Yeah, right. Just died by plagues, but entire civilizations. But you know the, in a way, when you're able to get your food quickly like that water, it leaves time for other things like God casting. Oh yeah. No, it's, it's, look, it's an awesome thing. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I think it would be real nice if we could all in some way reconnect the, it'll give us a little bit more perspective on things because the w the world that we have right now is the best world that's ever lived for sure that ever lived, that ever existed.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       I mean, this, this, this civilization that we're existing in right now, no question. Best ever. There's no question. It's just so much easier to be informed. So much easier to improve yourself. So much easier to get feedback. So much easier to communicate with people, get to know things and there's trust. There's trust in institutions. I've, at least in this country that, you know, when you just said I, this is freshwater from a factory, you know, you don't know what went into it, but you trust that when you drink that water, it's from whole foods. You're not going to die of. Yeah. Nobody poisoned that water. Nobody took shortcuts. There's not feces in that water. A lot of countries you couldn't say that because you don't know who's taking, who's running control and who's got the government, their pocket. But we're really lucky in this country that we have institutions we can trust like a police force.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       We can trust overall. I know there's certain crops, the FBI, there are uh, the courts. There is objective law. Those things are fucking, we're so lucky that we all have things like due process and representative government. I don't have to worry about a police force knocking on my door. Sometimes you do. I guess if you've been up to stuff, but I don't have to worry about it. Somebody who has more power than me buying a government official who can then knock on my door and put me in jail on trumped up charges. Are there examples of that? Maybe, but for the most part other than a country where that's not the case. Thank God. I don't know why I just took this one. A Fox News rent. You should get that Gig, bro. That's right. That's going to get you the Fox News Gig. I can't, well, Fox News, if they could just take Donald Trump to task a little more polite.

Speaker 3:          01:07:36       How about you right next to Alex Jones and you'd be like the voice of reason, you know, like they have a hannity and colmes it callen and Jones. Oh, well listen, I, I just read your boy Michael Schirmer's book skeptic, which I really liked. Yeah, he's awesome. And Michael Shermer is created at, taken on the conspiracy theorists. Well, you know, he's great at being reasonable about things like he was, uh, he broke down the whole fire walking thing and he explained how he did it and he was explaining in a scientific way that's about conductivity. It's like there's a reason why we don't cook on the coals themselves because they're not very good conductors of heat. It's why heat up metal and the metal grate that goes over your grill. You Cook on that. Yeah. You don't want to walk on that. He's like, when you walk on those coals, it's like it takes a while for you as long as you move quickly.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Yep. You don't spend too much time with one spot, you're going to get all right. He's like heels. He gave us an actual scientific breakdown. He goes, after about 10 to 15 feet, it kind of gets crazy. Yeah. Cause then it's just too much time of you touching the coals, but he's like eight to 10 feet. You're okay. Him and Sam Harris, who? My favorite guests on your pocket. They're both great. They're both great. They're both fascinating in their own right. They're both, uh, you know, guys that we really, really need where there's, there's a lot of nutty shit out there. Like they came on or he came on rather Michael Shermer. One of the things that he wanted to talk about with this increased presence of people that honestly believe that there is some sort of a conspiracy, that the earth is flat and that can't even get, I can't, I don't have the energy.

Speaker 3:          01:08:58       I do. Ah, I have the attorney just to, would you look at it and quick bursts like the same thing. I have the energy to hold my breath. That's my same energy for flat earth. Hold my breath and I'll watch like a few minutes of a youtube video that I go, yeah, I have to shut it off like you're going, you're saying a bunch of shit that doesn't make any sense. Why does water spin to his fee attached with spending goal? If we really worse round water would spill over the side. Fuck, listen, you're not a fucking, you know, you're not a physicist, you know, you know, going up on our Youtube Channel, oh, it drives me to hates coming. I've met more people mad at me and I retweeted one the other day. I put up a real tweet from a real person that believes the earth is flat.

Speaker 3:          01:09:40       She shot me. He was saying it was a sell out. I know where your checks being cashed, bro. How come I hashtag flat earth like Hashtag flat earth is a real thing. 14 listen. Schermer sets on a great schirmer said, you know when you have people reaching the same conclusion from independent lines of inquiry, you got so many different independent lines of inquiry. People are doing their own research and they all converge on one conclusion. If you are then coming in to say, well this is my idea. If you're a conspiracy theorist said, well yes, but there's all this unexplained phenomenon, that's fine. But you know when I asked for it evidence, you know what I always get when I say why did it happen? And they go, it's been covered up dude. People are being killed with now is a bunch of Liars and 1100 scientists lied about the earth moon landing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       I mean, come on, sorry, a Christmas letter obviously. Who's signing your checks now? They spelled q three from an island. I think they do that in England too. Maybe flatter doesn't need a washed up failure anyway, Hashtag flat Earth Ah man. But here's the thing, there's video taken from the space station of the earth being round and have them circling the earth. There's time lapse video. You could see time lapse video of the Sun rising and falling, like you could see it. I'm not even talking about this. I know, but I mean, what do they think that is? That's all fake, right? Then all those people are liars. One has ever gone up. Their satellites aren't real. Did you know that's another one they do? No. Yeah. They think that satellites are actually low flying planes. I find they're probably just at the end of the day,

Speaker 1:          01:11:15       they need to belong to a group and they want to be exclusive. It's a little bit like, it's a little bit like the modern art. When Ann Rand I ran was walking through the museum of modern art and they were, a bunch of people were kind of clustered around that broom that had been stuffed into a pail and everybody was like, that's not interesting. And uh, it was really expensive. Then they went in and there was just a three light bulbs that had been strung together, hanging and, and when, when, wait a minute, I know what the fuck is going on here. These people are all trying to belong to an exclusive group and they're not really even looking at this art. They just want to be, you know, part of the cool kids that get it. You don't get it cause you're not sophisticated. But I, I get that they don't play chess and they don't collect wine.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       So this is their shot. This is their shit. It's a community. You have to go to Lacma. Uh Huh. Oh sure. How to La, what is it? La County Museum of art. What does that a white tapestry. You mean? He just took a light tapestry and framed it, but it's, it's the, it's the texture of the wine. It's eggshell white. They had a plexiglass box. Of course they did. It was a, is there like an amber colored? It was a small box. It was about maybe two feet high, maybe three or four feet wide. And it was, it was a roped off with wire. You couldn't get close to the touch it because it was art. Well this I, I spoke to this amazing artists who owns the comedy cellar in New York City. She owns the building and the comedies [inaudible] and her name is a Alva and she has her, have you ever been to the comedy store in New York?

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       Sure. So I'm sorry. The comedy cellar she had, if you look on the wall, there are all these amazing awe, awe. That's amazing. Yeah, it's amazing. It's, people were sitting on it though, so they had a rope it off. Genius. You can't sit on art. It'd be good to sit on amazing in a really uncomfortable way. It's an amazing piece. That's amazing. Incredible. In your home front swap the Bel Air Home, I'm just thinking creates amber. You could maybe put it like right at the front door. Like they walk in your house, they're like, look at what you're into. I mean you're in for a crazy night. Likud friends while box. You were an artist back in the seventies days and you do portraits are really cool. Like figures that you could identify with like this. Grow out with an amazing woman. She's an amazing painter. I mean like you, well you go, you want to buy that stuff. She said there was no way back in the day that she could even, like, people wouldn't even really teach you how to draw human famous. It was too literal. Too literal. You, you weren't getting into a school, you were getting into Cooper Union or anything because you were just too literal. You were not part of this ICT guys. That is the abstract movement and that's how human beings are. Did you, when you see like a Jackson pollock, did you ever, you ever go, wow, that would be cool to have or do you go, what

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       in the fuck? I don't know enough about art, which I with point of view, but he was, he was, he was a groundbreaker I guess in some ways in that he said he was doing something, get the fuck out of here. Yeah. He was a groundbreaker in splashing paint like a little kid would do well, but then he did, he was doing something, you know, I don't know. I don't want, man. All you have to do is like get in with the right group. You know, you do acid and below woody allen, you smoke cigarettes. He yell at your secretary, I paint would go, he's brilliant. He's brilliant. He's amazing. The guy's just standing over at this point and you know, hey man, if you're one of those guys out there that you like, fuck you Joe Rogan. I'm a big Jackson pollock fan. You don't know shit about art obviously.

Speaker 3:          01:14:55       No, no. He had something else about art. But the difference between how I see things and how other people see things, I'm sure he had did something else. He was doing something actually much more deliberate than that. So you ready for my Jackson pollock, a education here? I believe Jackson pollock was painting fractals. I think that there was a, there were so, so a fractal would be, if you look at the coastline of a, of a country, and then you look at the micro, um, what is it, the micro sort of, uh, uh, lines in that particular, it, they mimic the larger picture, the larger coastline. That would be a fractal, I believe. And Jackson pollock was different because not only it was the first guy to start doing that, but he was deliberately creating what other painters were not able to do, which was fractals, please.

Speaker 3:          01:15:44       Uh, please somebody tell me that I'm right about that personal reflections on Jackson pollock. So is that the case, Jamie? Is that what they're showing color Palette painted nightdress fractals. Huh? I had to be, well, what fractals, the best way to describe fractals is it's a geometric pattern that as you get closer to it, you see the, like if you look at it from a distance, you see a very particular shape. Like the Mandelbrot set is a perfect example of, of a, an amazing fractal. And it was one of the ones that the, the really nutty people used as proof that crop circles were from extra terrestrials because mathematicians had only figured out the Mandelbrot set. I just, I want to say less than a year before this crop circle appeared with a perfect mandelbrot set in some wheat field and the idea of this pull up a Mandelbrot set.

Speaker 3:          01:16:37       So you could see this actually an animated version of the Mandelbrot set, which is really the best way to look at it because as it goes closer you can see that it's the same thing on the outside in a smaller scale. And then it go you a closer than that and it's the same thing you saw on the outside but in a much smaller scale and then it goes on and on. That's apparently what what pollock was able to do that other painters have not been able to do. So there was something, here's the animation of the Mandelbrot set, so it's just crazy looking weird thing that as you get closer to it and it expands, you start, it starts revealing itself. It's end. It starts revealing how bizarre it is. Like as you see all these little things that stick out of these circles, these giant circles and smaller circles and then even smaller circles that are attached to that giant circle and each one of those gets infinitely smaller, keeps repeating.

Speaker 3:          01:17:24       It's exactly, and it never ends. You keep going deep into these things and you find another small circle and it has smaller circles on it and you go to Ed and the smaller circles and it just keeps going on and on and on and on and on. It's fascinating. So pull up the crop circle Mandelbrot set and see if you could find the history on it. Cause I think it was like, it was like one of those things where they were like, look someone who's doing these either the hoaxer is very educated and some sort of a mathematician and understands the proportions in making a correct manner or reasonably correct mandelbrot set or daily. I'm going with aliens, I'm going with the audience to do more fun. Look at that. Isn't that crazy though? It's a beautiful looking little thing someone made in the wheat field, you know, but the idea that it's impossible to walk and not leave trails like oh there's all these lines in there.

Speaker 3:          01:18:15       He fucks like what about those roads like go up like it's impossible to walk, like go to the image and make that larger. It's impossible to walk in there and not be detected. Um, I see roads. Do you see those fucking roads? Yeah, that's the problem. These fucking people, they never want to see everything. I know. They always want to like look at only the conspiracy. Why? Because it's fun. I used to be one of those people. Yeah. And Michael Shermer, his book he talks about in Spanish skeptic, he talks about Thomas Eager, I think mit professor who talks about yes, jet fuel that Burns at 2,700 degrees and, and steal, you know, it doesn't melt a, I can't remember, I, Jeff Still Burns at 1200 degrees and the steel, the structural steel in the World Trade Center, that doesn't melt until it's 2,700 degrees and say, you're right, the jet fuel may have gotten up to 1400 degrees.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       Here's the thing, at 1200 degrees or 1400 degrees, steel loses 50% of its integrity. Structural steel and the steel. And this was this guy from mit who is an actual, you know, professor of engineering when it comes to metallurgy. You know, and when you're at the Massachusetts technology, you know some shit, you know when you're a professor. That's why I hated that argument. It doesn't have to just melt. He said, he said, he'd say when, when there's irregularities in that structure over, you know, hundreds of feet and there are hundreds of degrees of reg and regulators. It will buckle. It'll that things will buckle. It'll break the clamps off. And the next thing you know, do you know what percentage, how about this crazy thing? This is also from Thomas Ego who is at mit professor, do you know what percentage of the World Trade Center Tower, one of them was of air? Like what percentage was made up of the air?

Speaker 3:          01:19:52       You think it was 50%. 20% meaning like if you look at the whole structure on the outside, how much of the inside is made of Aser? Well, good percentage of every building's made of air, right? Cause it's like a honeycomb. Sure. Going on. Yeah, I don't, what's a normal building? Uh, well, normal buildings have a lot of concrete and they're made it. This is no, this is an incredible building that was able to, it was basically a giant sail and it was able to take an incredible amount of force, not only from planes but from wind, like 300 mile an hour, you know, crazy, crazy, crazy stuff. And so it was an incredible feat of engineering designed by this Japanese, a architect and it was 110 stories high. 95% of that structure was air 95% which is incredible. Right. And so when it pancake that it, yeah, it felt, it felt, that's why it fell down that way.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       But yeah, for sure. Stop making buildings that are that big. Right. Well, he's settle the fuck down. It couldn't. It was, yeah. You have to make it so big. It's big. That's a big building. It seems silly. How about you make two smaller buildings? You fuck, I know that, you know, it was a feat of Manhattan and they want to do something awesome and revitalize the neighborhood. It was a revitalization project there. The real problem with conspiracy theories is it, some of them are true. That's the real problem. When you start going over history, you can get paralyzed by all the possibilities because so many things have been conspired and were pulled off throughout history. It's just a common thread throughout history, but the problem is when you're looking at things today like towers falling and buildings catching on fire and collapsing and all these conspiracies get thrown around, you will lose a massive amount of your life watching youtube videos and reading websites.

Speaker 3:          01:21:43       No, you ever six taking down rabbit holes and websites, I think dedicated to the nine 11 conspiracy. Oh, that's a small number, but it's, it's again, it's one of those things where people don't want to see both sides of it. They don't want to see both sides of it. I feel like for sure there was some incompetency for sure. There was some failure to understand the threat. Sure. Whether that was an intelligence failure who, I don't know, whatever it was, there were some, there was some failure. Right, and that allowed that whole thing to happen. Now, when any fun, when anything happens throughout history, there's two, there's one, there's two primary things that happen when something goes down. Number one is people capitalize on it. If there's an enormous event, there's something that happens, we get attacked and you know, they know what happens and they, there's, there's this, there's this moment now in time, right, where they have this potential to do things they couldn't do before because the mood of the country has shifted.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       The mood is on revenge movies on preventative measures, and then you can do things like go to Iraq and invade Iraq. That's a hundred percent fact that that is why they did that. They did not do that cause they thought our rack was going to attack us. There's no evidence whatsoever. They didn't know the weapons of mass destruction was all horse shit. Right? So the whole reason why they did is they look okay, we've got a tag, but on the good side we've got a fucking nice chance to go to Iraq here. Now the people that are looking and conspiracies, they all start to add things. So they'll start to say they engineered those attacks so they could go to Iraq. That's not necessarily true and way up way unlikely. It's also giving the government or a group of people, a lot of credit for organizing being that organizations and people keeping their mouth shut.

Speaker 3:          01:23:33       Yeah, I mean that's, that's it. Government incompetence and random events and momentum are probably the reason a lot of things that things happen. People do have agendas. I do think there was a group of people that had an agenda that wanted to take out the fourth largest army in the world, uh, Iraq because Iraq was posed a threat. But, but, um, those people probably got into the decision makers ear like George W. Bush and not a very wise guy. And uh, you know, so there, there were people that influenced, I think the invasion of Iraq who were smarter than the decision makers. Yes. That's what I, Bill Hicks had a great bit about the fourth largest army in the world thing. He's like, yeah, but after the first three armies, there's a real big dropoff. Yeah. He goes, yeah, the fifth largest army is a salvation army. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:22       Yeah. I think that the one of the right main reason after nine 11 was the idea was let's go into Iraq to show any other country like Pakistan, North Korea, that if they think there's any value in giving a weapon of mass destruction to an enemy like Okaydo, that it'll be the end of their country. Here's appears proof. You know, there was certainly probably a little bit of that, but also oil money, oil was a big factor. The ability to sort of engineer and control the environment of budgets. Correct. Engineering Control Lid was on lesson one, but a, well, no, because other than that doesn't hold water because the oil, there was money in a war effort, but oil is a commodity traded on the open market. So if you actually look at the way oil is traded, there's, there's a a tanker with oil and it's a war.

Speaker 3:          01:25:07       It's a commodity. So it's, it's an attack on an oil tanker can be on its way to a country and then it's that tanker is bought by a broker and it has to turn course and go back to another place. So oil is traded on the open world market. There's, there's oil that's about it. So the idea of the United States wanted to control the Iraqi oil is actually bogus because we lost a shitload of money and we don't, we don't get that oil money. We also produce enough of our own oil with fracking and things to always support it. Yeah. No we didn't done but let's look, but hold on a second. Cause look at it practically. Does Iraq hold fucking untold billions of gallons of oil? Yeah. Yes. And isn't it a great idea to be in control of a place that has billions of gallons of oil?

Speaker 3:          01:25:52       Aren't we in control of Iraq to invade and overthrow their government? We did, but we're not in control of it. Right? Well we're not in control, but we essentially overthrew their government and then gave control to other people if we decide to take it back. If there was some sort of an event in the United States decided to go in and take it back. There's, it's not like they're, they're going into North Korea. It's not like they're going into some established country with a powerful army like Russia. You know, they're going into some thing that we essentially broke down. We broke down, created a civil war between two rival factions of Islam, which nobody even predicted. I had no idea you'd be new about the area a lot more than a lot of people that we're talking about it because you grew up there. I remember you talking to me about that.

Speaker 3:          01:26:32       I remember you explained to me at the difference between the Shia and the Sunni and that these people do not fucking get along. And this is going to, and that it's a sodom was same guy being a psychopath and a fucking maniac. He is. He was also a nonreligious person. Yeah. And because he was secular, sort of bathurst is essentially essentially mean as much as you can be to exist in that area, you know. But because of that, you know, he kind of like controlled those people from going after each other. So my point being is there's a lot of fucking money to be made in Iraq in oil a lot. And the idea that that wasn't some form of motivation and how we see, we see these conversations that people have. It's one of the things about these wiki leaks, uh, documents that you get.

Speaker 3:          01:27:16       You get to see the connections at some of these people have with arms sales and with donations to the Clinton Foundation and with oil and big money, big money and so much wanting reconstruction, big money in weaponry, big money in oil drilling. There's big money in all of that stuff. And everybody's got their hand in the Pie. Everybody's, and then, then what happens is, you know, you have other countries, for example, look at Pakistan. Pakistan has dizzy or I love the way you say that Pakistan has zero interest in having a peaceful Afghanistan. I can't even say that France falls without making phone calls if you have enough phones. Uh, so then you have other countries like that that have less of an interest in keeping that country stable. So they foster conflict by supporting criminal networks, by supporting other vested interest in those country, keep those country's in turmoil.

Speaker 3:          01:28:11       And then you have a real problem. And, and the biggest issue with Eh, you know, if you wanted to get into a conspiracy, my God, this, the Iraq invasion, 2003 was good for Iran, made Iran a bigger player, probably made Russia more influential and certainly made the Shia in Iraq, the people that finally had some power and had control of oil over the Sunni minority. That is, remember what the British, British, British used to always do this right? The British would go into, for example, in Syria and things like that, that the Alawites in Syria are empower. The Alawites are a minority. That's what Bashar Al Assad is. And I believe the Alawites are Shia where majority of the country is Sunni. I believe it might be the other way around, but the British always would go into a country when they would take over, kind of colonize a country and they'd find them minority and they would give that minority

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       a lot of power. And here was the genius of that. They would, they would prop them up and because now the minority in that country had to be loyal to the British because if they weren't, if they, if they chose to now kind of side with any kind of a revolution side with any kind of an independence movement, the minority also knew that once that was over, the majority that they had been suppressing that they had been given favor over would then turn on them. So that was always a way of dividing and conquering. Find who the minority in the country is and go ahead and give them power so that they will, they will have to be loyal to us because they're survivable will depend on it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:49       Well, there's been really bizarre moments in history where leaders have actually contemplated how to keep the population under control in the event that there's no war. That's one of the big fears is the event that peace breaks out. I mean it's one of the reasons why they constructed the, the game of football. They, they made football to deal with the fact that people weren't going to war. And you had all these young men, they were ready to fuck a girl to kick some ass. And there was no ass to keck. You know, they had conquered America. They had wiped out all the native Americans and put them into reservations and that. So that was a sort of unspoken war. And then there was the wars with the British and the wars with the Spa Spanish and all this different shit that went on for how many hundreds of years.

Speaker 1:          01:30:31       And I'll throw out the question men, what was that? The great article a, I can't remember his name, but he wrote an article goes, I don't, I never trust anybody. Hasn't been punched in the face. And he said, civilization is an agreement among men to behave well. And you know, when you got civilization it's fine. But look at the simulated violence at all of us have to engage in I at 49 going box, look at the UFC. I never miss a fight. I, you know, I want to see it. I, there's something about that. I think mma, I've heard this is one of the fastest growing sports among young men all over the world. Oh, it's surprising when you see two men should kill each other with their bare hands. There are triggers. Visual triggers. The same as like with pornography, it's just visual triggers, right?

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       You're just like, there's that taps into my caveman there. There's certainly some of that. Yeah. So we've covered a lot of ground here and I, I feel good about it and know that the age of most of your father's, and I hope you've written down everything I fucking said. Mm. I'm going to be an Ottawa. Oh by the way, Ottawa. What are you doing in Ottawa? I'm doing a college there. Uh, September 30th and two colleges. Do you think that I would remember cause since we get such a wide, you have such a fine line. I should tell everybody where I'm going to be. Do I know I'm hopeless. Just text me and I'll tweet it. All right. And we'll be in a, we're sold out in San Jose. Oh Shit. Yeah. This September, 20 seconds and shy so she will go, Joe Rogan is and lied to me. I'm like, I didn't say I was going to be there and her job and I find it and get it in October 13th. Tickets available. Bria Bria

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       in California this weekend. This weekend. Uh, we are going this Thursday. I'm going to be in San Jose. What about Friday and Saturday? I'm around. You want to work? Actually Friday, Saturday I have cakes and son of a, by no Friday I'm in Ventura. Not Know where you are. If I am adventure at Saturday, I am at uh, UC Santa Barbara doing standup to another college. Yeah, he smarty pants. Do you get out there with a book and start reading and you don't want to be a little edgy and I like to see how far I can push it. Like last time I did you see UC Santa Barbara? I said, um, maybe don't think, I know you guys think that you're the center of the universe. Maybe. Maybe put yourself last in all categories. Maybe you're not that important. It might be good. We, it was this unempowering. I don't like the way you think.

Speaker 3:          01:32:41       Well, but, but we live in a world where it says self my kids, I'm gonna fucking yell at the school. You're not that important. Your dreams are going to important. Mike kids went down there to get an education, not to be taught by some fucking 49 year old burn out, but you're not in Paul. But he looks a lot younger than 49. He's got tight fitting skin from a distance, from a distance, from a homes. I think about getting old. Yeah, you should. You're getting old. It's why training. That's why I do my yoga has no getting around it buddy. I know. It is what it is. Um, I think we saw it a lot of the problems I think, I don't think we solve shit and I don't think this is what I think. I think the world's perspective is a lot like my lego pile that I was talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       Little tiny legos get put on all the time and sometimes we have to take legos off sometimes. Like we've created areas of protection where we don't really need any protection. The big, big one being humor. I can people try to dissect humor and pretend that these are actual statements, like you're giving a fucking affidavit in court or something like that. Like people say ridiculous things. They don't really mean. That's why you laugh at them cause you know they don't really mean it. You know, and the, the idea that you're allowed to get triggered by these things and you know you're allowed to protest to get upset. It's, it's just a symptom of us being too soft. Just a symptom of life being too soft and gentle snowflakes. I couldn't agree more fragile snowflakes. I couldn't agree more so scared but get some perspective. Yeah, they can't so much worse if shit went down just like it did on nine 11 then you get this beautiful community of people that are happy and, and truly thankful, but it's almost like shit has to go down for us to remember or you've got to do something really hard.

Speaker 3:          01:34:17       I think that's one of the great things about exercise. Like, sometimes I'll come out of a workout and I fucking love everybody. I want to hug people. I just love endorphin trying to your body. Yeah, I'm high as fuck on endorphins and on top of the endorphin thing, it's also like just a release of stress and it's working out is so difficult sometimes that when it is over, like you have this uh, you know, like the struggle of a peak training session. Like say if you're doing rounds on the bag right and you know you're going to do seven rounds in the bag and you hit that fourth round and you are fucking exhausted. Yes. And you know, you have do three more rounds and you know, in, you've got to go have to go hard. Like when it's, it's so hard to do when you're in the moment when your pr you're heaving and you're looking at the clock and is still a minute and 45 to go and you're, and you're just breathing fire and trying to pace yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:35:11       That's so much more difficult than everything else. Then once you get out, everything else is like, ah, vince, Vince Lombardi said fatigue makes cowards of us all. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. I think you said of men and specific. Hold on. Listen, that's back in the old days. I'm going to be at the hook on and I know you're going to be mad him up. No cause I didn't want you to cause I get made you guys make fun of me for not being good at marketing. Get on it. Oh I'm going to be at the Algonquin Commons theater and Ottawa. Yes. Friday, September 30th I'll gunk when Commons theater. Wow. That was so I'm not doing it cause it's a con. It's a theater. What might be out of college sometimes. Like they'll hold things like for the whole community. I decided have you been to Ottawa? You had been to Ottawa.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       I love Ottawa. I love Canada. Canada. I'm a big fan of Toronto of sure for sure. I'm excited. Algonquin common stuff. The big fan of Vancouver, big fan of Montreal. I just like it up there and I like the people better let me too. They're nicer when shit hits the fan. That's where I go. Let's go out there. We want to go hunt. Toronto's cold as fuck cold together. We've got to meet you. Have you met my friend? The Rivets? They'll move in in Alberta. No, they live way the fuck up there. They live in a log house and they shoot bears every day. Really? It's just too far up there. How about that? The get all their meat from the woods, man, they're way up there. There are two and a half hours outside of Edmonton. Ooh, yeah, maybe more. It might be like 300 I spend a lot of time in Edmonton.

Speaker 3:          01:36:32       It's a fun town too and I think there's something about the fact that those people have to endure on godly temperatures. They bond together. It's incredible and they do a lot of drugs, lot of drugs, which kind of drugs? Cocaine and I was at, if I was a toot head, if I wanted a tune up, I'd be, oh, I've been, I've been offered more below in tr and Edmonton. God bless those people. How do you think they get it in? If you think about it, right? Canada's is way the fuck up there and you can't even grow coke in North America. There's, you know that. No, I think you can't be grown in the United States Google if that's possible. But if that's true, I've been repeating that all my life and I'm pretty sure I got it from an ice tea song.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       My really, my feeling is talking about conspiracy. I'm sure with that kind of money, they're probably people that are border control and stuff or getting, it's just too easy to let it through. I think it's from the song high rollers and whether it be a high roller, does cocoa beans? Truth is cocoa beans do grow in the u s but only in very limited areas. Typically cocoa beans are grown in a narrow band referred to as the coca belt or chocolate belt. His band exists. It's 20 degrees of latitude. Coca. No, but that's Choco. We're talking about coco cocoa beans. That's chocolate. Chocolate's legal. Know that. Yeah. Now we're talking about cocoa beans. We'll actually call him about leaves. Jamie. It's not it's cocaine. Coca plant. Yeah. Cocoa clients. Yeah. We, so we added the OAA, which is the chocolate stuff, which is weird because it doesn't taste good.

Speaker 3:          01:38:10       You ever have like raw cocoa? Yes. It's really good for you. But it does not taste that good. No, it doesn't. It's bitter. Don't we have this some shit that we're putting in our, um, butter from cocoa or something like that? What does it a cow. Cow. Cow. Oh, that's right. Yeah. But, but Coco Coco was first processed with milk and sugar. That was a real kind of that, cause we got it from South America. Right. And then they took it back to you, but it didn't say illegal. Awesome. If you could grow it. Yeah. But it said it right below that or you pull it back up, you could see it. People grow. Do people grow cocaine? Right. Their board straight dope. I don't know. See if that, but that's just a message board and I start trying to find, I have a question for you.

Speaker 3:          01:38:49       Please do. Um, I, I, what do you think of when we do legalize marijuana? Right. If it does get legalized, it'd be a lot of, there'd be a lot of the lobbying efforts and stuff like that. But why do you feel about marijuana use and teenagers? I don't think it's good idea, but I would do it. Yeah. Yeah. I was 15. I don't think it's a good idea that for a growing mind cause I think that we'd contend to. I think thc is still an mind altering substance and just like anything else and it has its benefits. But I think as you're growing, it feels like it can be for the most part, for a young mind, a motivation. Keller it could be. I think there's a lot of factors that could play into the big picture of who you become. It certainly could be one of them to deny that it's not influential. I think it's kind of silly. Um, and also to a really truly understand the effects of it's, uh, the way thc if

Speaker 2:          01:39:46       affects the developing mind. It's not completely understood and it's, it's definitely under debate. You know, there's, there's a lot of studies that have shown that it's actually not bad at all. For a woman to be smoking it while her baby's in the womb, which is really contrary to what a lot of people think. Right? But whether or not it's beneficial for a young kid, first of all, it's probably,

Speaker 3:          01:40:07       it's,

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       if you think of how old you are when you actually are an adult, I mean we have this number, right? The numbers 18 right? But your brain doesn't really fully form, it's not fully formed to your early twenties right? Yeah. So there's, there's a bunch of shit going on and if you're altering

Speaker 3:          01:40:24       nat, who knows what the consequences are, you know, like I'm find why we have laws against drinking when you're under aged or smoking, not all countries seeing other countries, they have

Speaker 2:          01:40:37       less instances of alcohol abuse per capita because it's not this forbidden taboo thing. I, there's a real argument for that too, is that kids don't like being told what to do and when you can get away with your friends and someone sneaks a little fucking flask of whiskey and we all around drinking in our

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       clubhouse like, Ooh, we're cool. But if, if it was legal and easy to get, we might not be so inclined to do that. I Dunno. I Dunno either. I don't know. I know France doesn't have the same issues, but Russia does. Russia being Russia and wouldn't be that fun. You know, those are winters, the winters and the fact that, you know, they got conquered by the Mongols for 200 fucking years also being run by it. You also being controlled by the czar right now and putting some, sorry, he's a terrifying person. They keep fucking shooting guys that know a lot about Russian doping for the Olympics to keep shooting these dope and scientists and journalists. Yeah. But the doping scientists, they're dropping like flies and didn't pay attention to that. Yeah. Holy Shit. There you got, there was a conspiracy. Oh, that's a real one. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:37       Someone's murdering those fucking people. They know too much and they're being taken Russian intelligence. Whoa. Poisoning you with odorless, tasteless substances that the KGB is very good at, or the fsm or whatever it's called now. Uh, and now apparently putting is revamping the intelligence [inaudible] DOMESTICA intelligence agency. Putin knows that. We know he has botox on his forehead. I didn't know that he did. I'm not going to admit or deny that. As far as the way to shiny. Yeah. It's like an old lady at the beauty power. There's this journalist that wrote an article in 2012 about him. She's still alive but she has been harassed. But she basically, you know, talk about a gutsy woman. Like she just basically wrote this expo Zahn him done a lot of call him a small mean simple minded man. There's a lot more than that man. What Putin is is like a throwback, you know, Jocko willink.

Speaker 3:          01:42:28       My friend is a former navy seal Jockos. He's got a good sense of like the way he classified, it's like perfect goes. He's a gangster. Both. Both uses of the word. That's right. Like the guys is running the country by himself, like gangster and he's also a real, he's a real gangster. He's one of the rare like actual dictators where it's like, oh you go, he's got like a little thing in front of him. He's pretending that he's but the reality, oh, he's the king. He's the king of her people. But that, that did that since they love him. Yeah, he's got 80% approval rating or something. People love trump too. There's something about, first of all, the 80% approval rating is probably a lot like Kim Jong. Ooh and shout a hundred percent approval rating. You know, like the choices. Well, that Gas Kasparov, you ever hear what he said?

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       Yeah. He said that to governor pence. Uh, trump's running mate, trump's running mate said, uh, uh, he's a strong leader. You can't deny it's a strong leader. And Garry Kasparov said, Mister [inaudible], Mister pence, governor pence saying a flattened me Putin is a strong leader is like saying arsenic is a strong drink. Your country should be ashamed of you. I couldn't agree more because you do need to know the difference. You didn't need to know that when, when you talk about a strong leader, a strong man in that context, what you're really talking about is a man who thinks he's above the institutions of that country. He's above the rule of law. You are at his whim and what a strong men do. I'll create. As long as you give me all your money, I'll create security. As long as you give me all your freedom, I'll create security as long as you say nothing bad about me.

Speaker 3:          01:43:58       What was that Dan Carlin, my favorite quote, they Romans created a wasteland and called it peace. Russia. Russia is a one crop economy. When's the last time you bought a Russian? Good. Give me one thing. You ever buy a restaurant up here? Everything is from Russia. Russian car rush, rush, and I'm washing machine. Yes. Russian. You know nanotechnology by those big hats. A lot of hats with the flaps that come down the side. Vodka. She isn't even that good anymore. We make it better. So we'd make us better. And then you've got to dare you. I don't even know what you're saying. Oil. I don't agree with any of this. All right. No, you're right. His pocket. I think that there's also this game that that pence guy has to play. I mean, he's been playing the small time politics game now he's going global. I mean there's this game that this guy has to play where he has to say Nice things about people that Donald Trump has said nice things about, you know, Donald Trump has said that he's a fan of Putin.

Speaker 3:          01:44:48       Yeah. Robert Gates. Yeah. Robert Gates. You know Robert Gates, who was secretary of defense, who served eight presidents over 50 years. Okay, Robert, sorry. Robert Gates, right. Wrote an article in the New York Times. This is a guy who served Republican administrations. Look up Robert Gates for a second. Hold on. Look at this art. I know, I know it says Mike Pence as it's inarguable that Putin is a stronger leader than Obama. He's in. He's for me. You're, you're, uh, you're an ignorant miss when you say things that are irresponsible. Robert Gates said that Donald Trump is not only unfit but dangerous for the defense of this country. He has zero idea, the nuances that go into geopolitics, what it takes. He's just a, he worked, he operates on his gut, his gut level, and I think that the guy isn't even interested in knowing what he doesn't know. He's telling me fried chicken with a fork and knife.

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       Can't stand him. Some collar with mom. I don't like Hillary either. Be honest because I'm more of a libertarian, but it'll taste thing. I don't like that guy. He's an EGOMANIAC and I think he's dangerous. Beyond repair, do you think that he thought that this was ever going to really work out this way? That he would actually be the Republican nominee? Question. Unless he was doing it for his own brand. I can see him. He's so, everything comes back to that guy. It's all about him, right? It's all about him. And I wouldn't be surprised if, yeah, he said, I'm going to run. It's going to be good for my brand. It's going to get make me more famous, which is all he's ever been interested in seams and it'll be, it'll be good for my company and all that. And all of a sudden he went and hold on man, I'm, I'm actually going to do this.

Speaker 3:          01:46:17       But I don't think he wants to work that hard. The presidency of the United States. That's a hard thing to, well, I would assume that he has a ton of obligations always. Right. And I assume all those obligations make him a substantial amount of money. Unlike being the president, the president is not a substantial amount of money in, in well you names like after the fact put his money and he put his company in a trust under his kid's name and that's not, that's not the issue. But I mean you really think he wants to step away from everything and run the country for half a million bucks a year. I don't know. I think that he doesn't, I think that's a good question. 400 president has earned $400,000 annual salary along with a $50,000 annual expense account, a $100,000 non taxable travel account and the $19,000 for entertainment. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:47:03       Hmm. 19,000 a year from entertainment. Yeah. I spend a lot more than the most recent raisins. Salary was approved by Congress and President Bill Clinton in 1999 went into effect in 2001 so Clinton was balling. How convenient that motherfucker ball and you wanted that 400 grand, 400 grand back then was probably a lot of money. I think Sam Harris Today on your podcasts did a great job of describing Donald Trump. He said, I don't know if he's ever said anything. I've, and I've listened to everything he said. I mean, I tried to listen to the speeches. I try to listen to these interviews and I agree with them. I don't think that Donald Trump has ever sent anything profound or insightful. I've never heard him say even anything substansive about what he would do, about major challenges in this country other than the fact that he would build a wall.

Speaker 3:          01:47:46       Very general. Good luck with that. And, and uh, and get tough. He get tough on law and order. It's going to get tough luck. Demagogues, all demagogues in history always talked about law and order and how we have to get tough. And that is another way of saying, give me more power. Give me more guns. I'm going to keep things. I'm going to enforce the law because apparently our cities are hell holes. But that's not true. It's not true. The cities have become places where a lot of people go and they've never been safer in the history of this country, in New York City, et cetera. So, you know, this guy is, he's got lots of sensationalist things to say, but there's very little substance long unstylish short on substance. But he's always been that guy. That's his whole marketing campaign. Well, he's, he was a salesman.

Speaker 3:          01:48:34       He sells himself. He puts his name everywhere. He brands things. He's got this, this look, he wears nice suits. You know, he's got to look even with his hair. Come on. He knows he could cut his hair better than that. Yeah, he does that shit on purpose. He does that shit because he knows it's like his whole thing. His whole thing is just the whole wackiness of it all. Yeah. But my issue becomes more about like when people say he's got to be smart because he made a lot of money. Okay. So we extrapolate. We make these sort of large claims and even I would do that. Look, he's an entrepreneur. He does run a company. He has created some value in his brand. He did have luxury apartment. When I think of trump, I think of Nice hotels and nice apartments. I don't want to take everything away from him.

Speaker 3:          01:49:15       He's had mistakes. Entrepreneurs make mistakes. So I don't begrudge them that. Well, here's the deal. What is this becomes a problem with that word smart. Whether or not you just decide this person's smart, he's gotta be smart. This person's smart, she's smart, he's smart. And then he tried like, Whoa, he's got 130 Iq. What does that mean? You're really good at problem solving. How good are you socially? You know, how good are you understanding people? How good a conversationalist are you? There's a lot of variables when it comes to what is smart, what's not smart. Obviously that guy is fairly good at making fuckloads of money, right? He's fairly good at running casinos and hotels and restaurants is in menial things fall apart and drop and you know there's people lose money. There's a lot of ups and downs when it comes to business. But you know, he's flying around in jets.

Speaker 3:          01:50:00       He's got big houses and Shit. I mean, there's a lot of success there. It's not like he lost all of his money and he's poor. He inherited about $200 million in, had it whole apparatus, including lawyers and political connections in New York. But he'd, he'd, you know, he'd say, well, what I see that with a number of years, 200 millions, but he had money before that. You get inherited that money. No, before he was given like 2 million bucks by his parents, his alone start at first. But this is ridiculous. His father was a huge developer and he'd always followed his father around. His father was a giant developer in New York and he inherited essentially not only, not only the money, but also the political apparatus to connections. You know, so much of, of trump's, uh, when he bought so many of those buildings in New York and he, I think at the center of his empire, 15 buildings in New York City, he bought those buildings and he got huge tax breaks.

Speaker 3:          01:50:48       Again, I don't begrudge that developers work deals with the city and they get big tax breaks. But remember a lot of those deals came from deep inside political connections and connections to construction companies, many of which were owned by gangsters. That's just the way you do business in New York City. Again, I don't criticize that, but please don't act as though you weren't using the political system and greasing the political palms to get and make and hold on to your money when you criticize other people. But it's kind of admitting that he did and he's saying he understands how the system was. Like we was talking about how we went to Hillary Clinton's wedding relate, like he gave her money, he gave her money and went to her wedding. Yeah, it's great lived, which is, by the way, when you watch those, those debates, he's really entertaining.

Speaker 3:          01:51:41       I mean, he is. You can't, you can't, you can't begrudge people. I don't think it's good to say that all people that support trump are dumb or rednecks. I think that's prejudice and ridiculous. There are people that are really fed up with the way things were working. The system democratic and Republican is not working for them. And there are a thousand reasons and they're gone, at least this guy speaking his mind and he's just different, you know, I get it, but please man, please, he's, he's not the answer. Plus, it's kind of fun. He's fun. It's kind of fun when this, this guy, well, the whole thing fun for us to hang out with. You know what I mean? He's a guy, you know? Maybe if we can be assured that he wasn't being recorded, you could feel free. We got a couple of pops in him.

Speaker 3:          01:52:21       Yes. Yeah, maybe. But there's a bunch of issues with Clinton as well, you know, and you look at all the stuff that's attached to her and all the people that think that there's something wrong with her and what she represents and it's, there's not one ideal choice. And then, okay, Jill Stein, who the Green Party candidate, she just says that she thinks that 16 year old should be allowed to vote, which is hilarious. Yeah. Um, no, they would vote for new UNICORNS and Narnia. The children, they're teenagers. Teenagers shouldn't be able to decide their friends or future of the world. It's crazy. They're children. They're living at home still like stop. No, no. You don't get to decide how the world board. That's crazy. That's so good. I take about the way I thought when I was 25 versus now. I mean 16 I was such a monkey was a monkey.

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       The idea that anybody could ask me any questions other than wise, my dick hard all the time. I don't have any answers. I don't know what the fuck's going on. My God, I agree. All these people that are running for president are all silly. They're all silly people. You need like, like literally would need like a Sam Harris and then he would, you know, you'd need like a really smart guy who could be pragmatic about things and then he could appoint people who are qualified. I don't need to nominate Sam cause he doesn't want to do it. But you know what I'm saying? Yam has his limits. You know, Sam, what's interesting about Sam Harrison, I there Sam Harris's that Sam's model for human behavior and Sam's model for the way things should work is that essentially people are rational. You know, that, that he'll cause his arguments for against religion, if you listened to some of his speeches are listen now are this is the problem is that, you know, Jonathan Heit, who's a great thinker and they had a debate and Jonathan Heights' set that Sam Harris, Sam, you're a model for human beings.

Speaker 3:          01:54:12       It's a little bit outdated because you're assuming human minds are rational. Uh, human beings are intuitive. We are emotional. And in fact we're, we're emotional and we will create rationality around those impulses and those emotions. So even he has his limitations on how human beings work. And I'm sure we'd be criticizing his point of view as well. But I agree with it. Stop right there because that's a giant generalization. Whenever someone says human beings are this, there's a giant percentage of us that are totally irrational and out of her fucking mind. And then there's a percentage of us that are rational and I shouldn't say us cause I'm not necessarily sure I'm rational. Our personality, we would like some parts of our, our, our personalities are rational parts. I, Hey, you know why? You know, I spar in case I get in a fight. That's how insecure I am.

Speaker 3:          01:54:55       Like I just want to be ready for an imaginary scenario. Does that make any sense? Not really, dude, but when you are, I'm losing my power. Never had much anyway. But do you lift weights? Yes. I dead lift. I know you can't tell, but dude, if I'm going to show you my lower back and my ass, okay. Yeah, I worked for my court. I'm gonna look forward to, I believe you. All right, well now I feel like you're, when we were talking about, um, just like someone generalizing, people do this or people do that. I think people are absolutely capable of better and I think they're wiser now than they were hundreds of years ago when they believed unbelievably ridiculous things. It's not that long. It's such a short amount of time with how far people have come. You know, like we were talking about earlier when we first brought up this Matt Leblanc, frank putting in perspective the steps that have been made and then the,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       the progress that has been made. It's a, it's a strange time. It's a strange time because on one hand you do have these really fascinating, really rational people that make some great points and you go, wow, maybe there's hope for us. But I think it's like when I send that little building blocks, he's Lego's. You put a little tiny lego layer of layer lego's on with each little experience in each little of the way it gets interpreted by people and they add up to things. So our version of like what reality is now, it keeps changing and growing and expanding and morphing as opposed to, you know, a 1930s movie depiction of reality, which is really all we have to go on. Other than the history books. Yes. What do we have to do it? We have to go on like what it looked like to watch.

Speaker 2:          01:56:25       Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf like that? How do they talk to each other? Who were these people like? What is this? How people were back then? Because you've got the written word, you know when you got coming closer to the answers. Right. Is it, would you say moving towards more of a truthful model, at least for how the world works? I think it's so far away, but I think it will happen quicker than you think because I think with the exponential expansion of technology, it's going to accelerate all this learning and this understanding. It's going to, I think one of the things that we're, we're feeling really weird about when it comes to the Internet, is this a invasion effect where it's invading our lives. It's invading people's privacy. It's invading your time. People are getting addicted to checking websites and checking their phone. It's got this sort of invasives thing.

Speaker 2:          01:57:08       And when I look at that, like the other day I was at um, this place and all these people were on their phone and I just stopped and I was just looking around and all these people are walking and talking on their phone at holding their phone in front of them. I'm like, this is a takeover. This is a takeover. Like if that was an alien, like it looks cute cause it's glass and it's beautiful and it sits in your pocket. But if there was like an alien that came and landed in your ear and demanded as much time as your phone demands, like we would think, oh my God, human beings, they're minds are being taken over by this being. If something just climbed up on top of your face and in and just start talking in your ear, hey man, I got to my dance with me, and they're like, oh, you're like sitting there like with these aliens on your ear all day people, people would freak out.

Speaker 2:          01:57:53       They're like, oh my God, we've got to get back to being people. Well, there's some weird filter between being a person and then being a person, communicating with people only through technology, only through electronics, that you're inseparable, inseparable from these things. It's true. All those things are leading us in some sort of a weird way, closer and closer and closer together to a neural net. Yeah, man, it's, it's, it's going to take place. It's just a matter of when. It's not a lot of, well, someday maybe no, it's going to take place. Whether or not we all choose to voluntarily join in, I don't know, but it's, I think it's going to be just one of the inevitable realities of the future. Like um, auto driving cars, self driving cars are in there. They seem to be like, and though, right? So yeah, that's

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       what ended. It always feels like human beings are pushing toward what their version of him mortality. Like everybody wants to live forever, right? Everybody wants to live forever. Like germ theory. Germ theory was a radical theory. I mean the germ theory remember was it's a very new concept. You know, germ theory was don't drink that water because there is, there are germs in there when lave and hook and vented the microscope and was checking his own saliva before he brushed his teeth. He would like, he'd look and see there's all this, did germs in my mouth and they're these little microbes that were, that you can't see. But I created these lenses and you can see them and then he would clean his mouth out and he'd spit into the slide and he'd say, ah, there are less of those moving things in my mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:59:28       That was the beginning. And people like that with the beginning of, uh, of the idea that there is something called bacteria and now we're realizing there are good bacteria and bad bacteria and maybe your bile. But all of these, all these sorts of developments were there to push us beyond our biology. So we didn't have to die of infection anymore because we came up with this idea because Alexander Fleming came up with something called penicillin. He had a cold and he, his snot dripped into a petri dish that had some mold in it. And he realized that the, the mold, it killed the bacteria that was in his nose. And he went, wait a minute, I'm going to invent something called penicillin and antibiotics were born. So we had all these, all these giant leaps, this idea that you can't see them but their germs. So wash your hands, what?

Speaker 1:          02:00:17       And then we'll keep things like the bubonic plague may be at bay, et Cetera, et cetera. And so as we move in this direction of understanding, of understanding about our own biology, understanding about our own psychology, understanding about, you know, sort of the dangers of certain ideologies, uh, and, and why we should embrace other ideologies. Like for example, I don't know everybody's of the same moral worth because some of these weird and different because they're gay or there were weird clothing, that doesn't mean they should be ostracized. In fact, that means they should be included. Well, what are we doing here with all this knowledge? What we're doing is we're saying this is a better way to live. This is a more comfortable way to live. This will allow us to live for a longer period of time in more comfort. But why? Why is it so we can come up with better movies, books, ideas?

Speaker 1:          02:01:13       It starts to get to a point where you're like, what are we doing this for? Like is it just for our entertainment? And then does that mean that we are chasing more sensation? It might be sensory sensation or is the idea to achieve a higher level of understanding. And then there are problems that we really have trouble with, which is something like climate change. Climate change is real. You've got ice sheets melting at a rate. You know, I think what is the, the Los Angeles basin uses one kilometer of water a year and Greenland's ice sheet is melting. It's something like 240 kilometers. I mean, something crazy. And we're losing, you know, sea levels are going to rise. There's this other huge existential threat that's going to affect all of us. Maybe push a half a billion people who live on coastlines inland to create a massive amount of, uh, you know, uh, ecological changes on a scale maybe we haven't seen.

Speaker 1:          02:02:15       So it's just a very strange thing as we get closer to learning how to live together and learning a better life as we create this neural net where we're getting a better understanding of what it's like to be somebody else, even though their culture, their software so different, it makes us more compassionate, I suppose, as a group of people. Right. We can have a language for it. We have a, at least we're trying, at least we know that's important. At least we know things like racism, even though it exists, is kind of a bad idea for a lot of reasons. Yes, we're getting closer to this goal, but then I feel like there's this giant tidal wave behind us,

Speaker 2:          02:02:51       ecological title women see me and then what is that? Honestly, it's all a moot point. If we get hit by an asteroid and we have a lot of near Earth objects that could fucking, it's a little in civilization instantaneously. It comes back to fractals. Well, there's also, there's that little bomb in Chelsea. I could have been obliterated. I got all these plans. It really does go back to fractals because one of the mind fuck of all Mindfox is that when you go into a person's body, the deeper you go, you hit their selves. You go into their cells, you find subatomic particles blinking out of existence, and most of it is air anyway, which is a lot like what the fucking universe. So we don't, we don't know because we only have a limited amount of ability to measure these things, but it's entirely possible that inside every one of those events, subatomic events where seeing particles blinking in and out of existence, you might be able to go deeper and deeper and deeper and find a whole new universe.

Speaker 2:          02:03:41       The human cells, the university human cells and the mechanisms as so intricate and so detailed, and there's so much going on that it's actually mind boggling. You could spend a lifetime studying how a cell breaks down and what is going on in a salad. You could spend a lifetime. That's the true nature of infinity, and that's why it's so impossible to grasp because if there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in this universe, each with hundreds of billions of stars, it's entirely possible that all of that could just be one subatomic particle that's in another cell, that's in some other person in some other universe. And that goes on and I mean that is the true nature of infinity, that it has no end. So it is entirely possible that we'll we look at as a structure. You look at the inner universe like, wow, that's amazing. Constantly expanding thing. It's, it's so beautiful and there's so many cell, there's so many stars that it might be a part of a cell that's in measurable

Speaker 3:          02:04:37       to our Little Puny La. Maybe. Maybe the answer then is surrender like socrates and Newton to the argue of the greatest minds that we, at least in the European tradition, socrates says, I know more than everybody else because I'm very aware of the fact that I basically know nothing after a lifetime of contemplation. And then Newton said, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, but he kind of liked himself to a kid skipping a rock. Do you think the surface of the ocean, that's how much he knows newt was on the spectrum because it seemed like Newton had some really weird thing. You know what he said right at the end of his life, his greatest accomplishment. You know what his greatest accomplishment. So funny, he said, my greatest accomplishment comp, he invented calculus, invented calculus. It's the spatial relations theory. Gravity motion. I mean he's just, he's the father of all scientists.

Speaker 3:          02:05:22       Right. And uh, he said that he said, my lifelong, the, my biggest achievement was lifelong celibacy. Yeah. That was his thing. Yeah. He was into no Posey, very religious, very religious. But whatever that meant. But yes. Do I think he was on the spectrum? I think a mind like that on that level was on a lot of spectrums. Well, what do I know? But that's another thing, right? Isn't it? When you, when we measure something or a label, something like, oh, he's got asperger's, or he's autistic, you know, like what, what are you, what does that even mean? Right? Okay. It's not like being a white guy, right? He's got blue eyes up yet, but he does, I see his eyes. They're blue. He's the autistic. Oh, yeah, yeah. I see the big gay on his forehead. No, you don't. There's no, like, how do you, what is it?

Speaker 3:          02:06:08       Just a series of characteristics and there's a spectrum, right? So what, what level is, uh, Einstein that, you know, what level is Elon Musk? At what level are you at, you know? Well, maybe the answer then is to get really good at one thing. That's what a lot of people is like. The Zen sort of, that's where archery's in, in the art of archery, you know, you, you learn everything through one thing, through deep, deep practice and deep immersion into one particular discipline. Because what it requires to be expert mastery, like mastery at something will lead you to a deeper understanding of all things that that would be the sort of Zen Asian mindset, which I've always loved. I tend to be interested in a fuck load of things, but there is something to be said about Josh Waitzkin, his book and the art of learning where he said when he was learning, he was a chess master and then he got so into Jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          02:06:59       Is Marcella Garcia his first black belt? And he said, I, when I was studying Jujitsu, I was getting better at chess when I was doing chess, I was getting better at Jujitsu. So maybe all of its related. Well, I'm sure it is, but what my point was just so many people's brains work so differently and I wonder if that's all just a part of the mechanism as well is that in order for this thing to keep moving, it can't be a bunch of farmers can't just be what everybody's way humans interact with each other and the innovation that comes out of that, the communication that comes out of that, the the change and the influence that comes out of that, even things is innocuous. As a podcast, she two dudes that sat down, one of them being a terrorist survivor yourself maybe, maybe smoked a little marijuana and just rambled for two and a half hours.

Speaker 3:          02:07:46       I heard, I heard the explosion and saw the smoke. Yes, because see, I think that the, all of the experiences that we all have, the good and the bad, they're influential in some sort of a strange way and it all seems to be kind of balancing itself out or at least pushing into a certain direction and that direction seems to be the improvement of the civilization. Even the like poorly thought out measures like this woman riding this awful article about Matt Leblanc. The idea behind it that she's going to get support is because she's saying that someone is doing something even though it's not true, someone's doing something bad for society and culture. This person has a voice of influence and they should never work again because society and culture demands that you behave a certain way or we will take away your livelihood. No more jokes.

Speaker 3:          02:08:33       Well what the only way that would work at all other than you're just a mean person and you're trying to like take people's jobs away and make people poor. The only way it would work is if you're promoting something of merit for the civilization. So by saying someone is awful and terrible and this is why they should never work again like you were in some sort of way in your lane minded attempt, you're trying to push culture forward. Yes, and I think that is trying to solve a problem. Yeah. That's a common thread. Even when we're looking at dealing with international crisis's. The reason why we're looking at those crises is, is we don't want them to blow up in our face. We want to push towards a better future is dangerous though because this is where, um, principles and understanding and understanding what the goal is.

Speaker 3:          02:09:22       Philosophy is very important. And I'll give you an example. You gotta be very careful of giving people a pass and not saying you are, but of giving people a pass in the notion that they're trying to solve a problem because the means don't justify the ends. You have plenty of examples. Uh, I had an acting teacher one time. He said, if you're trying to play Hitler, you're trying to play Stalin as an actor. You can't play him as a monster. You've got to play him as a guy who's trying to solve a problem. You know, in Hitler's mind, in his twisted mind, he was trying to solve a problem. That problem was Jews, Gypsies, gays or anybody who wasn't quote Unquote Arion. And he was going to make, at the end of the day, he's going to make the world a better place. And that's where I think, and this is where the real work comes in. That's where I think it's so important to be able to articulate for yourself and for others why, why certain things are better, certain ways of living, certain beliefs, certain practices. My God, Pr, cultural practice, certain philosophies politically for example, are better for the greater good. Then is this over here? And that's where people like Michael Shermer and Sam Harris are doing great work. That's where those guys sit around and they articulate

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       for us things that we might intuitively feel or they sway us in a better direction when our emotion takes us in a different direction. When our emotion says, let's vote for trump because he's a guy who at least is quote unquote getting shit done or he's taken the chess and the toilet in the air and then the more sober thinkers who spend time thinking about this say, hey bri, hey joe, hey steve over there. Um, I know you feel this way. Let me, let me steer you over here and here's why. Because we should be actually, it's not just about trying to solve the problem, but let, let's, let's get to what we're really trying to get to and here's what,

Speaker 2:          02:11:12       there's also a lot going on. We're like we talked about before, people love to be on a team. They love to associate with a group. We all do, and that's why they were in that ugly hat. That red hat with the white letters, keep ms, make America great again, and that's not, that's a, that's a fuck you to everyone is looking, it's a bread feather. It's on your, a bright red peacock feather that's on your head and you're, it's, you're also like other assholes, fellow assholes. You see them and they honk at you and they'll like make America great gun Bro. And they'll pump their fist up. I mean, this is a part of what's going on here. It's not just a bunch of people that are like, look, this system is fucked. The only way it's going to be fixed is if it just, the whole thing gets thrown into turmoil. He's our best bet for that and I would agree. He's our best bet for that. He just is, is as far as like upsetting the tray and like going, okay, let's see what happens now. Well let's, let's, let's fix some shit. Obviously. How'd that guy get through? Yeah, like he's our best bet for that, but man, it's, it's dangerous. It's dangerous. It's dangerous to to also cater to that lowest common denominator

Speaker 1:          02:12:18       earned in revolutions, revolutions an even no matter how small, the idea that you're going to take, everything that's sort of settled, it was there for a reason that sort of became theirs. There is an organic set point sometimes to societies and when you come in and somebody just throws everything out with the bath water, it does historically have a good, it typically doesn't have a good day.

Speaker 2:          02:12:40       Does that mean maybe you can maybe can't be, it's possible they could engineer correctly, but the, the, the real issue is he doesn't like as a spokesperson, he doesn't represent progress. No. Like Obama represented substantial progress over Bush as far as speaking as far as his intelligence level has articulation level. His likeability is in that. I would even argue his also, his prudence is an inaction is he was very careful. He, a lot of what we'll define Obama's presidency I think, and probably in a favorable light, is, is the fact that he was not willing to take action very often, which is just as important sometimes as taking action. Do you think it's possible he could free Edward Snowden? The could exonerate him before he leaves office? I take heat for this, but personally I hope, I

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       hope he does. Pardon him. You got to take heat from that. Really? Yeah. I mean, a lot of people consider him a trader and I think, uh, you know, you hear a lot of this, but I think Edward Snowden did us a great service. I think he's a very gutsy guy. He's a very, he's an American of a patriot. I agree with it. He was alerting us of a crime that people that we elected, we're engaging in and a lot of people that we didn't elect a lot of people that we're doing something that's unconstitutional, that's not approved and that the citizens of the United States do not want. But that's a good example of emotion. Right? That's a good example of people that get very emotional at the idea that this guy betrayed our intelligence agency, our military and things like that. So that's what they're saying.

Speaker 3:          02:14:12       So that becomes team, you know, Bill, look at it in this perspective. They caught that fucking guy in New York, the book the bomber within a couple of days. Would they have been able to do that if they did not have extensive surveillance methods? That's a good question. And is that worth the influence that these these surveillance methods have on us? Like if you know that your phone's being watched and that all those Dick pictures that you send are all being collected somewhere and then all those crazy texts you sent about the government conspiracies are all being collected somewhere and potentially could be used against you if you run for office somewhere. So if you decide to run for office and he said, you know what, you know I love New York City is time. New York City had a mayor that the people understand I'm going to run for years.

Speaker 3:          02:14:58       I know I'm just an actor, but I want to. And then all of sudden they pull you into a room and say, Hey Brian, come over here. We just, we'd like to talk to you about some of the emails that you've sent over the years. I'll, I'll answer that question with two with two parts. What does this one, sorry. There's a new radio lab that's talking about surveillance. Yeah. Crazy. Crazy stories in it. And they've done good stuff in that Scott lab where they caught where they caught the cartel members and stuff. But I'll answer that two ways. One is if, if surveillance is a reality and law enforcement has to have some sort of surveillance, they do great work and they keep us safe. However, there are their history would suggest two things. One is that uh, surveillance, if you give the government power over you in that context, it's only going to grow unless you have very strong checks, balances and transparency.

Speaker 3:          02:15:48       It is only going to grow. And that has been the track record of every government and that's just how human beings are. They are going to take the power they feel is necessary and more so if you give it to them. So he was eisenhower leaving office that the military industrial complex, that crazy speech that he gave, which was just like whoa. It was precious. It wasn't, it was so amazing because it was only seen on television that one time and then it took until it was made into vhs or DVD or whatever and then leaked online where people got a glimpse. I mean most people are not going over former presidential speeches with a fine tooth comb trying to find nuggets of wisdom. But that one now has made its way into the cultural zeitgeist. Sure. Outcome. This really important. You know, it was a, it was a call, it was called to the people.

Speaker 3:          02:16:38       He's saying, be careful because there's a machine out there that wants to go to war. Well, be careful of this to the second part to the idea that surveillance and uh, is, is, you know, shouldn't be checked and Edward Snowden should be, is a trader. Well, well the fact is is that if the government now has control over what I say and if the government is listening in without my consent and I'm a private citizen who doesn't commit crimes, then I'm sorry, but the terrorists have won. They won because they changed the way I think and they changed the way my governor governs me and they have created anonymity and a power structure that can do whatever the fuck they want to its citizenry. That is UNAMERICAN, that is anti-constitutional. That is not the country I want to live in. It's not most importantly what makes this country great.

Speaker 3:          02:17:36       It is the opposite. It is what Russia does and a lot of other countries, so if you want a weaker country, ironically it is not to give government agencies, I don't care who they are, I don't care how well intentioned they are and a lot of them are well intentioned, they do great work and they keep us safe. You better have transparency and you have better have checks and balances and you better be following the law and you better have court orders, et Cetera, et cetera. I want all those systems in place. I want, I'm in my, and you know what, it might be cumbersome, might be a pain in the ass. It might even make us a little less safe sometimes, but I'll take it. I'll fucking take that over. Giving any government agency power over my private affairs and letting them listen in specifically.

Speaker 3:          02:18:23       And then ultimately, at the end of the day, a big part of the problem is that they're all just people like you, really curious. They're just people. You can really can't have people having that kind of control and power over other people. Just as we talked about at the beginning of the podcast, that starts out about Greenpeace and then after a, it becomes about having power. I mean, people love to have a position of influence and power and they don't give it up. Use it. Yeah. When, if that is your life, I mean, that is what you do. I'm a cop. I'm a police officer and I'm the law in this town. I mean, Pete, we love those movies. Um, the law, you know, that kind of craziness is, it's, it's human toxic hating. People always say, oh the cops and said like, look, there are a lot of great, like we said. I mean they were, were people is people stop saying, yeah, it's just people. So what's the solution? How do you, how do you, I mean the solution was fee. Well the solution, if you, if you read the constitution, you start with the federalist papers and read the Constitution and the bill of rights, that's the solution. That's what makes our country great. Again. I know I get, so I'm, I'm and I like to like, I like to point this out and that that is, they solve the political, if our

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       founding fathers that that's, that's the solution. Yes. New Challenges. Yes. This is complicated men. Yes, we do need surveillance. Yes, technology is making it so that they can listen in on all that, but it's also making them transparent. They're getting dusted left and right as people from our generation are slowly starting to get into office. And there's, there's more of that to people who grew up and have the internet when they were younger and it helped form their, their understanding of the world in a better way. And it also explained to them the nature of transparency. Like you're seeing this guy who was a hillary Clinton's email deleter they found his account on reddit and he was asking a couple of years ago how to delete emails, chains, mass. Yeah. I mean it's total smoking gun. Damn. They found it and then he deleted the reddit post after they found it because he had had a certain reddit handle and they could see, they could bring that reddit handle, they could connect it back to him.

Speaker 2:          02:20:24       Yeah. That a lot of that I suspect is, is, is hillary not wanting people to see that. She was talking about how this was an Islamic fundamentalist movement that began Bengazi stuff. Like there's a lot, you know, that they, the Obama administration has this strange edict and where they don't really mention that it's Islamic terrorism. They mentioned that it's extremism. Well, how about Orlando? They literally cut it out of the transcripts. The things that the shooter was saying, they'd cut mentions to Islam and [inaudible] were living. So we live in where, yeah, you're lying. That's not helping anybody not helping any. The fact of the matter is these people are Islamic fundamentalists and you're just gonna make things worse. If you don't acknowledge that fact, you're just going to deny people information. They're going to think there's some sort of conspiracy. They're going to get angry.

Speaker 2:          02:21:11       They're going to feel like they're not being represented properly. They're going to think these liberal pussies are fucking ruining our great country, and it's going to build up Donald Trump. That's where a guy like Donald Trump comes from. The over the over sensitivity of the left is what's created Donald Trump. The acceptance of Caitlyn Jenner created Donald Trump. This is Caitlyn Jenner is the prime. If you got to go back to Caitlyn Jenner, you gotta go back to Bruce Jenner first, right? And that goes just tiny, tiny little nose. He got, well, how about the jaw? He goes, jaw shave down. He's such a good looking man and is facing a rubber, you know, its face doesn't move. He can't talk. Right. It's crazy. And we're supposed to ignore the fact that he irresponsibly plowed into a woman and pushed her into fucking traffic and killed her. Was he on his phone? It was not paying attention.

Speaker 2:          02:21:53       He rear ended with a truck, a giant escalate that was pulling a boat. So he had all this weight, right. He slams in this woman's car, pushes her into traffic and she gets hit by an oncoming car and you know, we're supposed to be like, listen, diversity is what's important here and not a woman's life. What's important here? The My, exactly. Anyways, it just drops it. Everybody drops an exonerates him. And I'm not saying she should be punished forever being careless, but I'm saying that's a significant indicator of someone having a fucked up personality that all you want to do and these these talks, you talking

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       about gender and yourself, you fucking killed somebody in traffic, man. You should be, you should be talking about that life changing moment all the time. And I say, man, you know, like dude, like you could say, Hey guy, you can't say that to a girl. Kenya, she killed someone. Fucking God damn it. I'm tired of doing that. I'm tired of this. He, she switcheroo well I haven't. You got one for life. You'll fuck wait, what a bank. Well, can I ask you a question? You're 30 you have to make a choice, right? Hey, what are you in Guinea Pool? You could be whatever the fuck you want up until 30 once you hit 30 you got to shit or get off the pot. Who are you? Can I, what is his dwarf? Tiny people is midget dwarf. Both of those are bad words. I can't just say dwarfing.

Speaker 3:          02:23:07       The seven dwarfs. Midget. You can't say dwarf ism is an actual disease. So I can't call someone a dwarf. I think they all prefer a little people. You know? Again, we have too many fucking labels. There's too many labels attached to anything. A jail. Don't do it. Don't do dwarf jokes. Handsome and tall, and you have white privilege. I don't want to make fun of anybody who's anybody. I don't, I, I never shop on that. It's important to make fun of people. They need to know the ridiculous, but only if it's like their behavior. Yes. You know, south their genetics and especially not dwarfism. That's a motherfucker, you know, I'm only like a foot away from poor fism. There's several people that are foot taller than me. I'm five, eight to six foot eight. A lot of people out there, if I was a foot shorter, yeah, I'm a dwarf.

Speaker 3:          02:23:48       I walk around with Brennan Shop. I feel like a doorframe. No, and I feel like an old guy and you know, it hurts my feelings because women look at him and I could be a cup of coffee a lot of times. A Cup of coffee's nice. It'll be a spore. I like a cup of coffee. I'm like a mushroom. He's holding. I'm like a potted plant. He's holding it. He's walking down and they could give a fuck about the potted plant tape. Folks would be kind of cute. It says a cup. Let it go. Tait Fletcher says a cup of coffee's like a warm hug. You're going to let it go. Look, there's a lot of people that never got to be handsome. God, you're handsome for a long time. I sure it was. I'm still kind of all right. You're all right. I mean, look it, man.

Speaker 3:          02:24:18       You're funny. You're funny guy. I got a great mind. He went to him. Yeah, you're really fun to hang out. I like going camping with you. Uh, we got to do another hunting trip, dude. We do last one. Last one was bull ring. I haven't shot, my vote wasn't boring. I had a great time, but not as good. Come on, man. Gotta I gotta bring you, but you've got to learn how to shoot a bow and Arrow or we'll have to go use it. We'll use rifles. How about this? How about next hunting trip? I'll go with you and I won't even shoot anything because last couple of them you've been unsuccessful. I'll go and just be your backup. Listen, we are your ammunition corridor. I'll be a porter. I would like to, I like the whole day. A umbrella would be entire show, like P diddy's assistant.

Speaker 3:          02:24:59       I would be a fun, that would be a fun show if fantastic. My Book Cook Cause it would make us some tea, some tea and biscuits. It's four o'clock in the afternoon and it would be fair because I shot that Turkey and then you got nothing, you know. And we before that we just got skunked on that island. Outrageous. It's soaking wet for six days. And Ella, let's go. We needed another a hunting trail. I love doing them. Let's do it. Alright, I'm bringing on James Kingston. Now we're going to do another podcast and a couple of minutes. You gonna stick around for a few minutes to talk to this guy. He's got to run. Daddy's got to go.
