Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh, like an hour extra and get culinary. Talking about stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:06       One zero. The stars have aligned. The prophecy has come true. Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo together on episode nine. One one. This is episode nine slash 11 in the podcast. No, I'm not. I had a fucking work hard all week to grind out podcast to make sure that I hit episode nine slash 11 when we booked it. I knew how I go. Okay. There's a certain number of podcast I have to do to get this to nine slash 11. So Jane and I worked it out and we did it. Let me just say I'm very envious because I'm in my studio under bright lights and I've talked about going back to when I was just on radio that darkness, we can really think this is a wonderful studio. I'm going to do a studio. My next one with a fire pit. I'm going to have conversations outside. I've talked to about that because it's like primitive.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       It triggers now and that it's comforting. It feels good and it's kind of cool lighting. So that's the next studio we build. I'm going to build a fire pit, going to get some log, some actual real fire. You can only do that like certain times of the year in la though. Like when they, when they have fire season, they wouldn't let you do that shit. We will usually have like a little balcony or like a little outside courtyard with your fire pit and you Kinda, you have. I don't want a real fire pit, you know, like I feel like if you're going to have a fire pit with sharing bonfire, you should have an actual law. You should move to Hawaii part of the year and I will too. And then we'll just have a big fire in the jungle and create a whole renaissance. Just what we're talking Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       Helicopter secretly. Secretly he thinks that that could fix a lot. We could fix a lot with that. I was showing you. You like a decorated a correspondent for the news. Now what the fuck's going on? What do you mean? I mean, you're a euro, euro official White House Guy now, right? Like you're actually like a news guy, like a 100 percent legit. We'll verify the bureau and stuff, but that's just part of it, but like you're, you're in deep with the trump administration. Well, I've had trump on and I talked to him so. But I mean really. He's your buddy. Really, really. It's just that we're covering the resurgence of America. What made the country great lower taxes, empowering the people, bringing people together. The opposite of what MSM said. What's happening is mainstream media is literally almost dead. It's collapsing. I mean, look at you.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       I remember having dinner with you like six, seven years ago and you're like, yeah, we got a million downloads a week. Now it's $90 million or whatever it is, a month and 20 million on Youtube. And for Info wars it's similar numbers. It's a good week. Forty dollars million. We've had as many as 85 million people listen on radio and tune into videos in one week. That was election week, but our normal 40 something million. It's just crazy. How can they compete with that? They're still delusional. They advert CNN show is like a million viewers. Fox things. It's the big swinging deck. It's got $3 million. It's all, I'm sorry, people transmitting and broadcasting to geriatric homes, you know, where you see Fox News and CNN and nursing homes, you know, what you see with kids 10 years old, 10 years old at the college and beyond the Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       and it's infowars and it's always other folks. It's amazing. Yeah, it's a weird time as an NBA teams like those shows where you have to tune in from eight to nine and you have to sit through the commercials. That's kind of all gone away because of dvrs because now people will just have to wait a few minutes. He could dvr through all the commercials or you record things after the fact. I have ever. You'd like 15 years ago saying the internet killed television. They haven't announced that yet. You Watch it's going to kill it because how can they compete with what you can do on the Internet? You know, a guy getting screwed by a horse or whatever it is. How the hell can you compete with all this craziness? Did you see the guy in China? They got jacked by the tiger today? Oh, I did see that yesterday, actually it was yesterday.

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       Let me look, let me not pick it mission and just go through here. Well, they even shot at the tiger. So the scattered the Tigers, they shot at the Tigers to get them off this dude. And then even after the bullets were shot off, this tiger was like, no, fuck that. I'm going back in. And he ran in after they shot at him and finally killed a dude and it was all. Everybody's got their phone up and they're all filming it fell in or jumped in. He jumped and he wanted to get killed. Oh really? Yeah. He would know this. That was another guy who went in with a line and try to convert them to Christianity touristy there. That guy. It's crazy. Whenever the Bible and he's trying to convert the lines line just fucked him up. I'll tell you what's crazy about that though is imagine trying to convert him.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Maybe he was just like praying that the motherfucking line when he know he went in on his own, he was talking to them in the name of Jesus and he was like talking to. You never seen it. Jamie. Pull it up. Definitely. Probably Schizophrenia. See, here he is. He gets in there and he's. He's talking to the lines. This motherfucker just jumped the fence and decided he was going to convert the lines of Christianity and lions are apparently like way cooler than tiger. What is going on here? Tigers see people and they just fucked him up immediately. The line like barely fuck that guy up. He just kind of slips because they're, they're more tribal or more like dogs pack animal there. The only cat that a pack or a group. So they're not, you know as agro. Exactly. When a tiger sees you, you're in my territory, I'm going to kill you.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Yeah. Tiger is a totally different beast. Like tiger. Sometimes they'll like adopt another little animal, like a wild dog or something like would be licking on it. Big Knife to it and tell them what to say it. Yeah. The d word stuff, remember the only way you could see this before is with those animal attack videos. Remember those animals know we started the same way. They always start off with a dog attack, a dog attacking a mailman and Iguanas out attacked your leg, and then it slowly ends up with drunk Mexicans at a Rodeo on a wild bull with a rope and those bulls are smart as hell and they drag them these drunk Mexicans and they dragged their heads along the rails and just crushed these dudes in between the railing. Like some serious brain trauma. Yeah, vicious brain trauma. They need one

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       word it with just 100 percent of that because that was the most exciting shit. Alex Jones. How the fuck is TV getting compete with that? So that's what we're saying. Yeah. They can't compete. So that was kind of wrong though because Netflix is tv and it's also the Internet. It's like both things. Sure. It's forcing the power of Hollywood basically dispersed though. Yeah. Well they. I mean, look, it's, it's better if it gets. If, if the ability to get your workout gets to more people. It's better, it's better if anybody can do like the new competition in these new youtube stars, like all they have to do is stand in front of a camera and this zero production value, they don't have. I mean, if you've got a camera, you've got an Internet connection, you can have a youtube show. People find you interesting. All of a sudden you've got millions and millions of subscribers.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       I mean, Eddie was bringing up this fact for your audience up front. A lot of MSM lies and says, I'm this big right wing guy, but you guys know that I was really against George w Bush all you where you were arrested early on in the Bush administration. I remember when, when we first became friends in 1999, we were running around the White House are the, uh, the state capital lawn with, with, with George Bush junior and senior masks on. And you were always again, sure the bush supported trump is the entire power structure of the media. I mean the Vatican, the communist Chinese or Saudi Arabians all put money in and said, stop him, stop him. And then lives that. The Russians were giving him money with no proof and so the issue is he's simply trying to actually be president and not have special interest in their running him and that's why the whole power structure is against trump.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       So Andy was asking before we went live, well, how is it you're this outside guy against the establishment, but now you're for it. No, trump's trying to create a beachhead. You just to explain it, to try to take the country back and actually devolve power back to the states and back to the people doesn't mean he's perfect, but notice the stock market went up a trillion, $200,000,000,000 a year, just the last month or so because a lot of institutional investors and others understand what trump is trying to create real prosperity, not a bunch of social engineering and I'm not here to pitch trump to people. The issue is is that there were major intelligence agencies and and patriots and the government who were sick of what was happening and we're sick of, of of Hillary and Obama backing jihadist groups, other things, and so they're rolling those groups up right now. They really are standing up against them and this is a historic moment and and so there's been a counter-coup through the electoral process in our country and that's what wikileaks was.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       That wasn't the Russians. That was US intelligence agencies. I said two months ago that Anthony Winter in New York, you know, who might have a dean's husband, the former congressman, a that was working for Hillary. I said that he's under investigation for child porn. Okay. And then now it came out yesterday that they're looking at indicting him for child porn. While I had that from the NYP that came out yesterday. Wow. Why would, what did he do? He had something on his computer. Well now that they won't tell us, but I was told that tied into that whole pizzagate thing, which again, the media misrepresented what we said and did. It came out and all those wiki leaks, all these weird coats. Okay. Like there was a bunch of weird codes about pizza and about a piece of pizza and Obama wants $65,000 in hot dogs delivered and they're like, are these really good hot dogs?

Speaker 1:          00:09:04       Hot dogs weren't as good last time. Well, these are succulent on dogs. That's not about kids. Do you have to be? Well, what is that about? It's male prostitutes. I mean, that's what the code means really? Yeah. Okay. Yes. How do they get male prostitutes to see keep your fucking mouth shut? Well, cause you know, bad things happen if you don't. Federal Child Porn charges possible for Anthony Wiener. But, but I'm on record months ago. I'm on record months ago saying that that's the case because I had those sources and show the government good elements of the government know what's really going on. So the media that Mesh misrepresented and said, oh look at four Chan, they're talking about a thing called pizzagate and some pizza place in DC and the media looks at it and says, Oh, Alex Jones is claiming all this bad stuff's happening at this pizza place. I'm like, what is this?

Speaker 1:          00:09:47       So they divert some probably innocent pizza place to distract off of all the emails that the New York police have and the FBI have. That's just this monstrous reported pedophile network. So to just credit that they could create a fake story hoping we jump on it to then divert over to that story and then once we're on that, it diverts everybody off from Anthony Wiener, what hats, which reportedly, which leads reportedly to a larger network. So they're playing that far ahead so they're, they're literally attacking a pizza place with fake stories just so that people can focus on that and take attention off. Anthony Wiener. Yes, because I was connected to that story. It was connected to Podesta stuff in deceased or in New York and all this other crazy stuff. So I love saying because we're making a lot of like long sentences here and a lot of long statements, but let's, let's fear a lot of people that are going.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       What the fuck is pizza gate? There was this Ben Swan guy who did this recent piece about it and a lot of people got very angry. Did you see the piece? See the piece that he did? It seemed to me to be pretty measured and he was making some connections too, between that little symbol for child pedophilia. Yes. And uh, we're just pedophilia era, right? And the logo, the logo for the pizza place, he also made, did he make the hastert connection with Podesta, pastored a confirmed child molester and best buddies would pedesta and former speaker of the house. And then you expand on that. But let's, let's just do it step at a time because this is really kind of important stuff. So that's all 100 percent true. Right? So it's true that hastert it's in jail. It's true that hastert is a known pedophile that a judge called a serial pedophile, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       Yeah, that's true. Is One hundred percent. It's true. The Podesta was friends with hastert. That's 100 percent, right? Yes. And then all this other stuff now becomes odd, doesn't it become odd? And, but if you say it's odd, if you look at it, this bents one guy with this, what I thought was he was just kind of expressing what is weird about this case. And when he did it, he got so much shit over it. I was kind of shocked. I was kinda shocked people were calling him a moron and the same thing. But, but that's what I'm saying, they build a straw man. So imagine thousands of emails come out with them talking about we'll have the kids ready. Six, seven and eight in the hot tub at this time. And there didn't see anything like that. Oh, it gets. It gets really weird. Where did it say that it was in the emails?

Speaker 1:          00:12:06       There's thousands of them, but it said we'll get the kids in the hot tub. Yes. I never saw that. Can you? Can you see if you could find that to me? That seems like just the whole thing is so bizarre. It's like we're going to have the kids delivered for entertainment. There'll be in the hot tub now. These are great kids, but kids can be kids. We know what's fucked up about it is how few people really mentioned that connection to hastert. I always thought that would be a huge, huge, constant Jonah love the fact that there are very astute. I just bring up this whole big topic of how they twist things. You go right to the key points that, okay, Barney frank, who got caught running a underage male prostitute ring in the nineties out of his three story townhouse, you. I thought it was just a male prostitute thing.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       I didn't know somewhere and then, but listen, I was with them all the way up to age 19 plus or whatever, but then what happened is he goes on Cspan on the house floor and says, if you continue to investigate this, I'm going to expose the half of you that are involved in this, in this room, and the investigation got shut down. So the reason this is important, as for shadow government, you need something so bad that everybody who's involved in it ever, ever comes out will be destroyed. So that binds them all to the secrecy. So that's where child pornography comes in and that's where pedophilia comes in and that's where you get so many of the elite being into it, but just as you shed, you have the Republican establishment trying to get mastered out of nowhere as a wrestling coach to run for office.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Then reportedly, he's the pure career. Just like Penn state and just like they had something Dusky Dusky and the under age kids, they were quote mentoring, getting farmed out to supposedly big donors. What's this is who we're talking about. Two very specific cases where two very different cases, but what's crazy is they're both real. It's both real 100 percent send Dusky who is a very respected man. The community did a lot of charity work with a young disenfranchised children and was molesting them at the same time and was super respected in the community and he was the right hand man to Joe Paterno. So that whole thing just fell apart in the headquarters from our research with the pedophilia is like Pennsylvania. Okay. That's the Franklin cover and that's, that's, that's the. That's up in public. What does this see? Jamie says we plan to heat the pool, so a possibly Bonnie will be uber service to transport Ruby Emerson and Mave Lozado, 11, nine and almost seven.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       So you'll have some further entertainment and they will be in that pool for sure. What in the fuck? That's the only one of them. That's a real confirmed emails. Yes, Jesus Christ. Listen, here's the problem. So I have in ypd telling me before the election, like a month, yes, we're investigating wayner child porn photos. Go back to that please. I want to not just have kids out on the Internet but, but kids he's communicating with and their parents are basically letting them communicate with him. If I'm told this by didn't, why PD detectives, I mean the secret service gave me information about how hillary was collapsing all the time. Remember we reported that and then it got caught on tape. So, so show. All this stuff goes on and on and on. And so I'm not saying half the people or or, or 90 percent of them are, are, are, are guilty or innocent mall.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       This all I know is we start covering it, start asking questions. They then divert off into somebody on a fortune for forum pointing out. There was some email about a meeting at some pizza place in DC. We're top Democrats. Cow. They then turned the whole thing into I'm blaming some pizza place. I'm sending shooters into shoot people at a pizza place, makeup all this crazy ass crap when I never even said any of that, and then you go back to me two months ago, three months ago, I said, the police have told me they're investigating wiener for pedophilia and child porn when it was not in the news now known as it's in the news. What I'm saying? Okay, Elise, slow down. Before we get away from this, because I got to go back to that. There was a quote up there that are that Jamie pull up that I wanted to read the one on the lower bottom about this. Now this, these are the emails that you were talking about and these are 100 percent confirmed emails. Go back to that one. That was on the bottom. Scroll down to the. And I'm not saying any of these people are guilty. Yeah. What is that? Hold on a second here. So six grownups with two toddlers and two infants spread throughout the house and sure enough one of the toddlers was rubbing my nose at 5:45. What the fuck does that mean?

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       The FBI as a whole got back to retrieve the children they threw in the towel and what?

Speaker 1:          00:16:40       I don't know, man. This is like, I don't know what the fuck those emails mean, but look, let's just now everybody wants immediately shoe this away as disgusting when possible. We're talking about two very specific proven cases, right? Hastert, proven Sandusky, proven real huge elite, powerful people that were also active pedophiles, right? Yes. So that's a fact. Who Know each other in our bodies and then you've got Podesta's brother who's big in Washington in an article in 2007 in the Washington Post. I'm going to give you the exact headline, which was something like a radical art or something and it's like naked photos of the neighborhood. Kids in their house and then they're showing it, throwing it in your face. It's, it's, it's just crazy. But that's not even stuff I get into but there. But there is something to that because some of his artwork was super disturbing that he had in his house like this pink buckets. There were there were in their underwear and it looked like they had been paddled and they were all standing there with their butts facing very. It was more about this than others. See, and that's all I do is cover these real tanks. Don't give you the new nurse, but that is real. The government pissed off about this.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       The pedophile rings. We've gotten so big that the intelligence agencies began to leak all this info and I knew Hillary was planning to steal the election. She did steal five states according to the experts. And briefly how did she do that? I wouldn't mean trying to break into six days. It's not go on these long rants where there's a bunch of different statements that need to be addressed. So let's just from right there, you got to get to that. Like how did she steal five states can kind of gloss over that. Okay. No, she tried to. How did she tried to steal six days? She did steal five states. Well, Bev Harris was a big liberal Democrat at the Hbo Documentary, Hacking Democracy. She's the leading expert. She was actually a month before the election through whistleblowers got the actual code that had been loaded on machines all across the country should ever in studio to steal the election.

Speaker 3:          00:18:33       I saw hacking democracy and I saw that they did engineer those voting machines that you could have a third party input and change it and that it on live on the show. And that was a decade ago with Bush. This is new. Okay. Just wanted. She's the top election fraud expert. So she comes on my show, uh, the stories on infowars.com. And she says, uh, we've got evidence. And then I had the hacking experts on and I had the industry whistle blowers on and I had the county officials on at every level we have the fraud proven that Democrat connected grips. We're already loading code on a machines all over the country, but it's different complex. But about thing was 18 percent of the machines in the country to be able to remotely break in and, and flip votes show because they were aware of that. A bunch of states were waiting and watching and homeland security broken live into six dates and kept trying to flip the results, and they even have screenshots and videos of them in the computers in there clicking and doing it all.

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       There's major investigations going on. You heard the news, trump's crazy. He claims illegals voted to make it about illegals. That was one statement and a larger election fraud deal of actual computers show. So trump knows about all this, so she comes on and says they're planning this fraud. Then she comes on after the election and she says, yes, it's clear. Here's where precincts close. Here's where all this happened, where 100 percent went for Hillary or right after it closed, all the votes then came in. We're 100 percent for Hillary. They didn't even care, but the landslide was so big for trump. They couldn't steal it. She successfully stole five states. She tried to break into six others or her controllers did and got blocked. The tsunami for trump was so huge with the real politic. We can break down later that they still weren't able to steal it, and now patriots inside US intelligence agencies are preparing to roll up the pedophile networks nationwide. So you've seen arrest in Pennsylvania, arrested in La. I haven't seen these arrests. Who's getting there? It's just now breaking and it. It's. It's big institutionalized. One hundred 74 arrests, 28 sexually exploited children rescued during statewide human traffic operation. They're getting mentally, she has a takeover, right? Holy Shit. But look at the numbers. They're 474 people arrested, but there are only rolling up the rin fields that get the people for the psychic vampires know insane. Is it that this is still happening? Right? So all the people that thought that, this idea that, you know what

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I mean, whether they tried to make it ridiculous by calling a pizza gate are connected into a pizza place. Everybody that thought that was ridiculous. It is ridiculous that there could potentially be some sort of a pedophile ring and see how they tricked Turkish. They go pick some pizza place. Probably have their people go on, make comments on some message board. CNN, New York Times, Washington Post the same day, come out and say all the emails are discredited from New York and California and Hawaii because there's this innocent pizza place over here that some of the Democrats go to and they're all saying that's where the pedophiles are at. Okay, so then the Internet all goes in, looks at that and starts trying to prove to disprove msm that, oh, there must be something going on there. So then that turns that all into the big quagmire as a smokescreen from all the admitted stuff that's happening because I was told by my Nyp d high level sources that they've got all this stuff on wieners computer that just got scooped up during the whole hacking story and the whole story about Hillary and the unsecured servers and that that was being blocked by Obama and that as soon as trump got in, they would go back after winter.

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       Then I was told about former section chief from the CIA that indeed this was an operation that we're running against him to start leaking all this. And so what you're beginning to see is the beginning of all the pedophilia coming out as they roll up the procurers that grabbed your kids out of backyards or that go out as social workers and get the kids or whatever. They're rolling all those up right now to get the renfield. Renfield brings the people to Dracula because that's the allegory. I'm not saying it right, but I know what you're saying. So they're gonna now. Roll it up into the higher level groups right now. Here's what's going on with a lot of this stuff. You have to be real careful in how you describe these things and how you talk about these things because people are looking for any little tiny thing to discredit it and one of the reasons why they're looking at it, they're doing it for personal reasons because it seems you no one wants to be ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       No one wants to be a fool and no one wants to be someone who's talking about conspiracies that aren't real. So people are very hesitant to talk about something that's unproven but horrific. Just like 15 years ago, it was a conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church had any pedophelic. Now we know 30, 30 percent we're doing it. We now know the old pope had to step down, was blackmailed within fall about other high level preached by the new guy that came in. Uh, I mean this is heavy. It's the, the, the, the Catholic church stuff is absolutely horrible and proven over and over again. And again, when I was a kid, it was rumor, it was just things that were whispered. You would hear about it. And now it's. I always wondered how they're getting away with it. It's so out in the open. How come there isn't more of a psychic vampire stealing the energy from the kids? Well, what the most common thing they do find very often in jail, the most common thing they do is they find very troubled kids that don't talk about it. People with foster care, kids with no parents. Kids who come from really troubled backgrounds who were abused like Sandusky, ran a abused children's shelter and Grove

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       and then would take the kids out sometimes overnight. It rich people's houses to make them feel better. Yeah. Yeah. It's. And then no one wants to believe that the is that the assistant coach and that all these powerful people. But when he finally got caught, he was raping eight year olds in the showers at noon on a Saturday at the field house. Yeah. And someone who worked there, found it, watched it happen, walked in on them literally. And that's what it all fell apart. And that's what always happens. Those guys get more and more arrogant. And so all I'm telling you is I'm not saying anybody's guilty and these thousands of emails, you go read them and it's like the last walnut sauce you brought wasn't very good. Oh, well these are good walnuts. You're going to. Oh, I love walnuts. And then you go read in the FBI breakdown what? That's code for. What's called for Walnut means people with Brown skin. Oh Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       Well, Gunderson was talking about this for years. FBI chief formula. He discovered a bunch of it, uh, in Los Angeles. He was, he was the head of the La Sector. So people are gonna hear this. And they go, oh, they're a bunch of pizza gate troopers. These guys are a bunch of pizza. Great Truth. There's, there's, there's an inclination to automatically dismiss things. Let me be clear, let me be clear. I am on the covering 50 topics a day. These emails are coming out. I get contact with one of my sources by people in the NYP ed. I get sent documents, photos of their licensed law enforcement. I talked to these people. Then they say, yeah, no, it's horrible. It's a bunch of pedophilia. Um, you know, it, it, it's a bunch of child porn. It's all gonna come out. It's tied to all these different groups. And I'm just like, okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:19       So I go on air and I say, listen, I got this from real NYP and at other sources. And then Erik Prince of Blackwater still rests with the biggest groups in the world. Does he run some sort of military operation? And I'm like Bahrain, our Saudi Arabia. Absolutely. The point is, is that he comes back says, is that the UAE can ask you about it. He knows all about it. But the point is, is that all this happens and he comes out in the news. Okay, through the lighthouse, Oregon, breitbart basically from trump's mouth and says, yes, we've confirmed high level pedophilia rings in the Clinton operation. We're going to bring them down. And so that's what all this is. Why did Breitbart tweet about that in 2011? Do you remember that tweet, right? Barton knew about it. Came out right? Bart said, I'm going to bring out the biggest thing that's going to bring down the Democrats.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       And they poisoned him right here in California. Initially poisoned, you know? Absolutely. They killed him. Where did what happened? I didn't even know how he died. He, I thought he died of a heart attack. Is that what? Are you laughing? Fake laughing and pull up the. I'm laughing. Just. No, I know you're in the media. I'm a pull up bar out Joe. I won't buddy. You know. I love you. Anyway, pull up the breitbart email or the Breitbart tweet because it's a crazy. Joe knows all about this. Well, the tweet is pretty insane. When you read it, you're like, wait, what the fuck is going on? Like every. There's an instantaneous reaction that people have their intelligence, right? You're right. You're already telling me people are doing this to kids. You don't get the fuck out

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       of here. That's nonsense, but when you tell people about the stuff that's been proven, the ones that have their own account, they don't call. They don't attach those. I was on Air Shang. I'm told this by NYP ed in like three different shows and that there's going to come out that leaner sending child porn and it's in the news today what they're saying, what they're accusing Wiener of apparently sending sexually explicit text to an underage girl. That's what's against the law. So the calling the child porn, but it's essentially he was sending pornographic text to a 15 year old. Yeah, well I was told it's a lot more than that. What they're doing is minimizing it because the higher ups are being told you don't let this out. Let me tell you. Wiener supposedly had tens of thousands of emails. Wiener should be a fucking comedian for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       He's a freak. He's got real problems. He's a good communicator. A Betty's hilarious. Come on, don't you think? All I know is I'm not saying even wieners a pedophile. All I know is all I know is. Listen, we all know about Jerry Epstein. Okay. And that don't know about Jerry the Lolita Express. Just Google that. And what does that. Bill Clinton was on 20 flights first it was. Oh, that's right. Okay. Has a temple in it. And then he was also flying to this Middle Eastern country with this chic that's admitted pedophile with multimillion dollar checks at Bill Clinton on the plane. And Bill Clinton's a known sexual predator. Okay. So all this stuff's going on. And shall they start bringing up lawsuits against Donald Trump with Jane Doe's claiming he'd been with Epstein even though there's no proof and the law because they make you log in on private jets.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       None of it was ever true. He'd been at here is how Prague, Prague Progressive Guru John Podesta is in household name is worldclass under age, sex, slave up cover up or defending. Unspeakable dregs escapes me early on. Did John Podesta. Imagine his baby m, m, F A. I don't know what that is. Would be covering up for underage sex ops in H ow. Hate crimes against blacks. Don't know what that means. Um, what does m, m, f a young Jamie media matters. Huh? Isn't that still rose? Yeah, that's us. But also guess who owns the pizza place? Who were all this one on its, it's media matters. Head guy. David Brock's boyfriend and that is where they have major democratic party fundraisers. And then they had, they had rock bands there that, that gave live spoken word dissertations of the love of children. What I'm talking about guys liking golf? Drag con about how much they love children. Have you seen this? Yeah. I don't even really want to repeat what they really pull it up. One is a video of them saying that it was the comments, which is a comet ping pong. So do you know what? Why is really. It's a very, very bizarre subject. But why is this like. So what is this right here? You bring it up, Jamie. Okay. Give me some volume.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       Great thing.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       Can you are below a sandwich? Sharp shooter read is

Speaker 5:          00:29:51       two. Came down here. He likes the world sounds. We listening to his manager.

Speaker 4:          00:30:16       That's super weird. That first of all, does Comet Ping Pong? Anybody listening? Let's describe what that person looked like. They were wearing a wig, a blonde wig, and it was a guy transvestite or a woman who's just smoked every cigarette. It's one of the two. But uh, this is the fact that that was going on at that place. Seems really odd. But that sounds like someone ad libbing, you know, we all have preferences. I was trying to be funny, like it's almost like in the, in the, in the little boy. Oh yeah. A lot of creepy artwork and I'll talk to that guy. Lot of creepy artwork. I mean, that's a fact. There's a lot of facts. So it's one of those things are not saying that I'm not either. That's what's really important. I never even really covered this stuff. And then they had me on the news and also swan going, they said these people were killing kids in a basement.

Speaker 4:          00:31:12       They say, okay, I'm Megan Kelly went on and took a clip where I was talking about Hillary show funding jihadis and and Obama back in the Arab spring that killed tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands of people, thousands of children now. Al Qaeda was putting kids, which is Isis, into sex slavery. They edited that out and then cut it together on Fox News with me. Shane and Hillary Clinton ranks and kills children in a basement at ping pong pizza. They literally now edit audio, but I was able to get changed your audio. I was able to go find the day with video with what I really said and throw it back in their face. Wow. That's really blatant. That's what. Where's this? Can we watch this? Where? Where is this that they did that? You guys have to come the comparison of the two up? Yeah. It's something like Megan Kelly caught at giant lie against Alex show.

Speaker 4:          00:31:58       I'm trying to find that we should. We should play that fast. First of all, Megan Kelly, so pretty. She could say whatever the fuck she wants. I think she looks like an old training. I love her. Do things loosely. An old training. You're hilarious. No, I don't like old trainings, but I think she's hot. You know, like you don't think Meghan Kelly's. Now I just want to insult this globalist global. Obviously she's pretty. Do you know Joe? She's real ugly. She. Do you think that she was. She's moved over to NBC. Do you think she's going to change your tune now and go for the little niece? She wants to be the quote New Fox News show. They'll be the near kind of Glenn Beck. I'm a conservative, but I hate conservatives and Libertarians and I speak for everyone and I can decode it all so she shouldn't go over there and be the conservative light and try to get them some ratings. So it seems

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       like NBC realized is that's where the money. Is that what you're saying? Want to see how fake news is made from Meghan Kelly on Fox News? Did you find it Jeremy? Okay, let's play it here. Here we go. Give us some volume. This whole thing. Got Pizza Gate conspiracy gun man.

Speaker 6:          00:32:55       Many controversies. Do these days, it began with a tweet on October 30th days after the FBI announced they'd be reopening and investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Someone on twitter who's name remains unverified but has several thousand followers, posted that new emails found on Anthony Wiener's. Computer confirmed that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophilia ring. The twitter post included information from a facebook user who stated, quote, my Nyp dea source said it's much more viable and serious. Then classified material on wieners device. We're talking in international child enslavement and sex room. The next day.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       Places shouldn't be, but backing up to the second now, this is probably trying to debunk us. What they do is they misrepresent what we're saying, so again, whoever these rogue people were or or I don't know who they are saying, oh, look in ypd says it's wiener and all this. She highly, we're saying, none of that's happening now. It's actually starting to come out. I don't know how far, how deep it goes, but this is when Kelly, let's let it play out and respond to it afterwards. Otherwise, we're gonna. Go ahead.

Speaker 6:          00:34:01       This is the right one book user who stated, quote, my Nyp dea source said it's much more viable and serious then classified material on wieners device. We're talking in international child enslavement and sex ring the next day. The bogus claim was picked up by a website called your newswire.com message boards like four Chan and reddit right wing blogs and several pro trump websites. Info wars, Alex Jones, Afar right web host posted a youtube video seen almost 500,000 times

Speaker 2:          00:34:36       personally. I have zero fear Kenny up against you.

Speaker 6:          00:34:46       The rumor spread, inspiring some new found Internet sleuths to start digging around in John Podesta's hacked emails, searching for proof and location of the so called sex ring. What they found were numerous references to pizza.

Speaker 2:          00:35:02       Now, here's what our Jones

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       set resistance to tyrants is obedience message to Hillary.

Speaker 2:          00:35:12       What I think about children, Hillary Clinton has personally murdered the chopped up, right to have zero fear of standing up against know you heard me right it. Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children. Go tell that loan liar. Can't hold back anymore until the rivalry. Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       the planet's ever seen.

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       There's a twist to that, talking about the devil worship story with her chief of staff or campaign chairman, the League as a menu of blood and Shimon and body parts with Atlanta Alisha Crowley event, a private event. Oh No, I'm not talking about that. I mean 200,000 plus dead Christians with her operation with Syria and our operation in Libya and not letting the Christians get out and directing al Qaeda and isis who target and murdered children and put them through sex slavery and throw Catholic priest off cliffs and kill people and Mash and murder gauge and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people and they caught him by the there for open society and they love everybody. Anything they do is for degradation

Speaker 6:          00:36:26       and someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason. People like Alex Jones Fan, a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis. In fact, yes, it's a pack of lies and it's dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       What happened to the boyfriend

Speaker 6:          00:36:46       to drive across four state lines with an assault rifle and enter a family friendly restaurant at 3:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday. I know reddit has banned this topic on its website. I mean slowly but surely those who helped fan it are trying to dial it back out of the safety concerns for the safety of those who have been endangered by pis could happen to anyone. It's not just us. It's any single person. I know you said there are producers. It's also surreal until the gun comes in. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:37:17       And then some guy for being here. So they went. They got it. They didn't get it off youtube. They got the full clap. They cut the front off knowing. I was actually saying, I don't know about the satanism before the term pizza gate was out there, but I do know she's funded the radicals. I came, I saw they die. He do rape and kill and cut up kids. So she personally is.

Speaker 1:          00:37:39       You are making a very provocative statement and you made it very provocative statement by saying something kind of crazy at first. And then backing it up and so what they decided to do is just edit a chunk of that and so they didn't really have to edit it and chop it up. But they did take it, take it out of context and said that I was talking about. Right. But you weren't. And I was talking about the spirit cooking Alistair Crowley stuff with the lady is written, it's real for her. And they go and I take little kids have these parties and they have of blood. That's one thing, if you were an adult one to do that, you know, issue some art project. This is real. And so I was talking about the menu, were there in the email saying, you know, we're going to have plenty of blood, plenty of semen for you. And other delicious things on the menu. And he's like, what are the juices on the menu? And they go, well we're going to have cheese pizza. We're gonna have, we're gonna have the, the, the nut sauce. We're going to have the pasta and we're going to have, you know, Shaquille and hot dogs. We know you love sucking one hot dogs and they go, Oh God, I want to go back to that place in a why that had the best dogs, you

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       know, so yes, we've got hot dogs and Obama wants $65,000 or the hot dogs live with the party. Will the hot dogs be there? And then it's in Stratford and CII emails that got leaked by wikileaks did. Now people cross reference where the CIA's like watching going, oh look at Obama and Chicago, another hot dog party. Well did they momma is at a party with 15 dudes and that's his issue. The point is though, they can blackmail him with this and the stuff. We never got pedophile codes with Obama. Yeah, no, it's, it's men. I mean he's had his mother trying to say that Barack Obama is a homosexual. Sandy's bisexual. How dare you. I really don't even care if you ever seen him with a man. How do you know this is true of seeding with men walking down the street? Maybe he just likes to bring dudes and have conversations with them.

Speaker 3:          00:39:19       Maybe he just works hard to tell it to people and you're the head of the free world. Maybe he had a party with $65,000 with the hot dogs. Yeah, maybe loves hot dogs. He said, fuck it. Fuck this diet. I'm not the president anymore filling. Now listen, I tried 65,000, $65,000. He's balling. That's more of the 65,000 hot dogs. What a gourmet hot does. What a dollar apiece to color. How many say it's super gourmet? $5 a piece for each president needs a hot dog helping hands. What if it turns out he was like the 10 time hot dog eating champion. He's like one of those. That's probably it. What does that say? He probably. Okay. Let's say he just really likes hot dogs here. Alex Jones, like there's a whole article on sale for $65,000 for the hot dogs. $5 a piece. $5 per hotdog. But listen, you know, you got to get those delivered.

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       Someone's gonna make. I'm gonna. Grind it up, put it in the casing, the whole deal. Maybe he gets like gourmet hot dogs. Got to put those kids putting together some giant party. Some I'm out of this job party. I don't know, but what a dog is a code for male prostitutes. Okay. Maybe it is, but what I'm saying is anybody who's skeptical, anybody who's looking at this and go, and you guys are so fucking crazy. This is so you're. You're making such gigantic leaps of faith. No leaps. Just looking on how with the weird code in those emails, there was definitely some code and show after this one, I'm in fact my crew actually got mad to be honest with you, but you tell her about the truth. There were about five days into this and the news hadn't even picked it up and all my crew was doing all day reading thousands of emails.

Speaker 3:          00:40:51       I mean there's thousands that are just related to food and hot dogs and kids and hot tubs and kid deliveries and all and, and, and. Oh, the spirit cooking and Alistair Crowley and oh, there'll be semen and blood. I told my crew, I said, it's probably true. No one's going to believe it. Stop obsessing on it and stop reading these emails because I want to focus on the election and everything else that's happening, so then site start accusing me of covering up the the pedesta stuff before it's called pizza gate and then I get blamed for being behind pizza gate and I'm not even bitching. I'm explaining what it's like to really be trying to get at the truth and the people take the fact that it's complex. She'd be better at this to me. Jokes, you know how to put stuff out. Clear and Parson I just know all this crap, but you get crazy and still ran. People won't listen to me because I got too

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       much data. And you imagine what this is like. I mean it's just. I'm sick of it. I don't know everything that's going on, but I know this. I have good CIA people and FBI and secret service. Okay. Telling me. Yes. Alex. it's worse than, you know. Keep getting them. It's going to come out and it's starting to come out and saying, watch. When we started arresting the pedophile networks, we're going to roll up the Democrats and the Republicans that are involved, and that's why trump said in his speeches at the, at the inaugural, this is not about parties. We're taking these people on. We're bringing God back in. Even somebody that wasn't very religious like trump has gotten religion learning about this because let me tell you something. Trump's not a devil worshiper and he loves God and he's been briefed on all this and he's going to roll their ass up so the pedophiles better get ready.

Speaker 1:          00:42:12       I want to. I want you to clear something up right now. Look at that camera and tell everybody you're not bill Hicks. So stupid to tell them you're not. I'm not either tell them. Well, number one, people think there's a god conspiracy. Here's what happens. They think it's a flat earth too. I take real stuff. Notice Joseph has researched, not kissing his ass, so he knows all these little points on making better than I even did. Yeah. I'm like remembering stuff when he brings it up, because I try to suppress after is crap. I can't handle it anymore, man. I'm 43 and I'm sitting here looking at all this and that, and these people come to you on the street and they go, hey joe, hey, Joe sent me five times and then I tried like, oh, I knew you were. You know, we're, we're not just telling us Alex, whatever, whatever. My fucking name is the programming.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       Say Bill Hicks. Yeah, I got no stress. All they say, here's the. I'll be on the street or I'll be at a restaurant and they come over and they go. They say, hey bill, hey bill. Hey Bill. They don't really show Rogan variously and, and I'm, and I turned around and go, oh, I know what you all. Because I did a few pieces and one little video with a guy that lived in Austin and the unit, it's how I met with, but you don't like Bill Hicks. That's what's ridiculous about it. Like what'd you get? Like massive plastic surgery changed the way your voice sounds like your voice is so different than thing is that no one ever wants to look real conspiracies because they're complex and hard to understand. They want to just go with the earth is flat. Uh, you know, there's aliens living underneath the capital.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       Dinosaurs aren't real or. Well, no, I mean, listen, the point is I'm not going to Bash Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. It's good to have a free open mind, but he doesn't promulgate stuff. He's only researching what's been said. So I want to just get this out of the way. I am Bill Hicks. I'm actually, you are. Hell, we'll bill hicks be like 60. Um, I think he died at 32 and 1994. So, uh, do the math. I know one thing. It's hot in here isn't really. I don't know. I always keep my studio really cold. Oh, do you? Well, you get crazy. You're a goddamn fun. Inferno. A melting. You know, there's a lot of people that don't know like how you got started, but one of the things I thought was really bizarre in that thing was that lady was calling you a right wing host, a far right wing host.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       You've never been a right wing guy and it's a. it's a big misconception like you were always totally anti Bush. You've got arrested. Speaking as actually before Bush was even. You were trying to stop him from being elected back when Clinton was in, when he stole the election from Gore, who I didn't even really like. I still came out and exposed it and it's now been certified in Congress and they've documented. I just go with what the facts are, but you've never been. One of the things that really opened my eyes. This is a really important video that you did nine slash 11 road to tyranny. We talked about the World Trade Organization protests and how they had sent in these people in government uniforms with government issue boots and these anarchists. They were dressed in black and they. It's that this is an actual tactic that they'll use to break up peaceful protest will.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       They'll send in soldiers or policeman or whoever the hell they're hiring, no one knows and they send these people and they smash everything up. They started to turn into a violent protest and light things on fire and then they all hold up in a building and they negotiated their release and none of them were ever arrested and when you showed this clip by clip from these various news organizations and you focused on the kind of clothing they're wearing and the difference in their behavior versus the behavior of all the peaceful protests, and then show the result of it, which had these people that were walking to work with a WTO sticker that had a line through it and police stopped them and said, you can't have that sticker on that book bag. You committed Beta test for martial law, and again, I'm not anti cops themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:45:52       The media always spins it. You expose pedophilia. They blamed to the pizza place. You expose the government trying to make cops do bad things. Now you hate everybody. Not even been comped, I mean who knows who was doing the Delta Force. That makes sense. Delta force and I'm blasting Delta force. They were given an order by Clinton to go out and to recruit and they recruited just about 400 leftist foundation funded groups funded by big private foundations. They trained them for about a month before in Oregon. They flew them there, put them in a government housing facility. This was on the newsletter. I just covered local news story. They did retreat to a building and negotiated their surrender and they were released. Yes, yes, yes. But this was after all this property damage. They went out to start the attack, so they had it on video so they could then attack the hundred thousand peaceful protesters.

Speaker 1:          00:46:40       So this was something that, I mean we don't like. We like to think just like you don't like to think that pedophiles are real. You don't like to think that anyone in the government, whatever, organize some kind of an attack or some sort of a, a, a fake event where a bunch of people that you hire to start smashing things to make a peaceful protest look bad. We don't want to think that that's possible, but it is possible. Goes on, but it turns out that this is actually a documented yet tactic. Yes, there was the WTO, in fact, esquire about two years ago, was doing a profile on me and the guy, his dad database, a former CIA section chief and had been involved a bunch of stuff himself and I told him, I said, yeah, Delta force ran those riots, and he goes, you're a liar.

Speaker 1:          00:47:21       And I said, no, I'm not. He. He went and googled it and couldn't believe he got the Seattle Post intelligence surge and stuff and then even went and talked to a journalist that knew because he'd been there covering it as a journalist and he didn't even know. So he says in the esquire article, okay, Alex Jones got me there because even though I'd grown up in the CIA and stuff, I don't know that was happening, but, but let's be clear, it's criminal elements using compartmentalization that do this. They always claim I hate the government and I want to have a war and all this other stuff. No, I have to give credit to the good elements of the CIA and the good elements of the NSA. I mean, I'm good friends. That's a very important point. Very important point. I've had this point with a friend of mine when we were talking about, um, uh, I've had Mike Baker on the podcast before and through the few conversations that I've had with Mike Baker is formerly the CIA.

Speaker 1:          00:48:07       I get it. You start getting an understanding of how it works. Like these drug dealings that always kinda like jets crashing with all the coke on board. They're cowboys. You got like a few dudes, God's run inside sideshows few dudes who realize they can make a fuck load of money if they sell. And there might be a lot of people involved, but it's not the whole CIA. It's not like they have government memos on. It. Will do is they'll have a cover and option they're running. The president says do this. Like Ronald Reagan didn't know about the cocaine dealing. I've talked to folks that were involved actually for the points. He says, I want conesh knocked out congress. That'll give them the funding. They go, well you do in the government is you go, the president said, do this. We're we're men of action. We're going to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       So then there's cocaine already being sold. The contracts are using it to get all their funding will screw that. We'll just jacket bring it in using private contractors. And that wasn't the first time they did it for Vietnam. Vietnam too. But yeah, it was a. It was a common tactic. They knew that there was money that was being made from selling illegal drugs. Why would they let that money be made all around them? They're not going to. That's the argument is you don't want to let the communist do all the cocaine and heroin dealing or the kids, then they have more money than you. Well, what the fuck is going on in Afghanistan? It's just this crazy people. How much heroin production went up since our occupation? Anybody can pull this up again. That's what's frustrating is a lot of the fake liberals because I see myself as a real liberal, but a lot of the fake liberals just go, oh, that's a lot of this is like, no, you can search engine opium production in Afghanistan pre 2001 and then look at the latest years.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       It's come out in like 2014, 15. It went from three percent of world supply to seven percent. The 30 percent and after 10 years of occupation it went to 93 percent. Look at mobile supply. So look at the heck Taylor went from a, a memory will, was I right? Well, there were. It's pretty substantial increase between 2001, which is at an all time low on this chart from 94 to 2016. So 2000, one's an all time low and then the next year it fucking skyrocket, but Google and BBC and ap just type in Afghanistan, 90 plus percent world opium production. It's very, very hot. Ninety three percent and listened and also for like opiate pills or is it just for Jews for everything. So it's not like oxycontin's and things along those lines that they ordered the trips to the Taliban that works with them was allowed to grow it and then they're allowed to sell it to whoever wants to buy it. Well, not just that

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       there's been documented, confirm instances of troops that are being forced to guard poppy field. Sure. We'll, we'll let me break it down for it. Right when the shorter commitments on Fox News with Geraldo Rivera, remember that shareable that came out a year after I broke it again. Let me tell you how they work. It comes out that the trips are being ordered right there. It goes. Ninety percent of the world's supply of opm according to the United Nations and hit 93 last year. What? How many years old is this? A couple of years. Like three years old, two years old. Say It's gone from 93 right now. Jesus Christ. See I didn't lie. I said 93 and it's not for this. Yeah. So, but it. That's what's so frustrating is you know all this and then. And then people still call you crazy. Now what Alex, why do explain the fake news cyop why do a lot of people out there think info wars is total fake news?

Speaker 3:          00:51:14       Why do they think that? That is a major deep state government program funded by Soros mainly and they found the most effective way is anti Israel bashing and so this came out in the Wiki leaks last year. The US intelligence sleep, not the Russians that he's in there saying, we're going to overthrow Israel. We've got to deal with Saudi Arabia and we've got to up the ante with anti Israel rhetoric. I'm somebody that was neutral in Israel. Never been there, had nothing to do with it. Israel has liberals, conservatives, some good administration, some bad, but I'm not anti Israel. It's a tiny little place. I know it does some things that are bad compared to what we've done. It's nothing, so I just don't have some giant hard on for Israel, you know, wanting to hurt him and, and, and I'm not against the Palestinians or anybody else.

Speaker 3:          00:51:53       Everybody knows that show show when they killed Israelis from the reason I say it's wrong when they white phosphorous bomb Palestinians, I say it's wrong. Show. I'm sitting there covering all that and then they just put out that I'm this Israeli agent, you know, all day long, or I'm the CIA. Let's not get into these crazy rants about crazy accusations is why do they think info wars wars is fake news. I don't know you that a lot of people out there, smart people, really intelligent. They have. They think the real news is CNN. Okay, well let me explain. You've got attached from below and above. You've got major funding by Soros and others. There's a real life Nazi collaborator, like true Dr. Evil of the latest James Bond was based on his real accompany. It's even named after his company. You don't like the bad guy in the movie.

Speaker 3:          00:52:40       He actually Soros, yeah, he tried to crash the pound breakdown angle and he's really bad nose, so [inaudible] 18, but long story short about George Soros, he's funding this attack on me and any independent media. How do you attack independent media when the public's awake? The deep state and government stuff. You say Alex Jones is the government and then they always ignore real facts. I talk about her. I admit some of my family and stuff that's worked for the government and they said the carpet was corrupted out of control. That isn't even a real debate but. But above that. What was your other question? He had a with question was. Explain the Sol. Andy, let me. Let me just explain. It's pretty easy. Did their indirect competition with him? If it's Fox News, if it's CNN, if it's anybody that's distributing news, you're in direct competition with someone who has an independent news organization. They operate it themselves and

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       they do it online. Show just said it perfectly. That's it. Alex is in a very unusual position because he's a magnet people to people who are drawn to him like a lightening Rod. He says a lot of crazy shit. He goes on rants. He's very animated. He's fun to watch and a lot of this shit. He says this correct and we're getting into this right now like this. This thing about the WTO, which was like I said, was one of the first ones that really opened up my eyes. That was a long time ago too. That was like you put that video out in 2002 or something like when was that? Two thousand three. It was like 2011 right after nine slash 11 right after September 11th and put it on the web router if that. Exactly. I put it out on DVD or something up before that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       But you just said it joke. So let me try to actually thinking codified this then because my problem is I don't script what I say or that it's kind of all over the map, which is a good thing or a bad thing. You just did it on the head. You ask your question why they call me fake news. We just saw Megan Kelly two weeks before the election, say in a whole hour long show, special against fake news. We've played a few minutes of it. Alex Jones is the king of fake nose. He just said Hillary is chopping up children inside of basement at a pizza place. Now, granted, I was saying it in satire about her in the Middle East, so it begged for them to take it out of context, but they clearly did that to deceive their viewers. She's branding herself. I'm real. You can trust me. Look at this.

Speaker 1:          00:54:42       Poor victim, Alex Jones almost got him killed when none of it was true when none of it was, you're based in reality. And what I, what I was getting was from the NYP ed. Okay. And the FBI, who are good people are at least those agents show. There's an example of them branding, texting it in. They'll take something real life said. Or they've taken videos where I'm acting stupid. Uh, you know, with like five x six x underwear, it, if they're given the illegals or whatever. And they'll show them with underwear on my head and say, look, this guy's crazy and I get it. I cover serious topics so they can take it out of context. But when I'm being serious, which is 90 percent of the time I tell people, but when joe comes in and we've got joey, Joey, now, Joey Diaz talking about kidnapping people, I start laughing or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       Yeah, we had fun. Look, you're a normal person and that's a. that's what people find hard to believe. When I tell people I'm friends with Alex Jones, they go, get the fuck out of here. You're Casey. Great Guy. Great Guy. We have a good time together. We were very nice show. You're a great guy. I switched when we aren't also busy and hang out more like I'm the oldest. I know. Well, we can do it. I'm going to come back to Austin. I'm trying to get to Austin probably the spring trying to figure out when and when and where I'm going to get. But uh, I love Austin where you live as a fucking beautiful place. Well, I know these topics can be, you know, quite frankly exhausting. They are, they are, but, but I'd like to shove today really get into the big picture and what I believe is really going on because I figured out the basis of what's happening and I'm going to let you, I mean if you wanna hear some far out stuff today, I think because what you experienced, I mean, I'll go through it. Okay, let's go. Okay, let me take a piss then. Good. Because Joe's always so slick and columns. So are you, Eddie, me, I get in here and I just got another round. We're going to bring you down. We're going to bring you down to earth every now and then you're going to launch into orbit. We're going to grab you by your heels, bring

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       it back. We're going to be fine. We'll get through this. Go take a piss and then tell some crazy shit. Where's the bathroom? Right through that door to the right. Powerful alerts. Drones so far, Eddie, Bravo. Everything you wanted and more. Oh, absolutely. I'm just sitting here letting them just letting, letting the people, letting your fans know that have never listened to him. I listened to Alex Jones every goddamn day and she'd take a day off every now and then. Otherwise you'd be like, fuck bloom. Um, but he's a good guy. You know, he's always been a good guy. People that don't listen to them, they, they believe what the mainstream media has said about us, but it's also he makes it easy for them by saying crazy shit. Like Hillary Clinton chops up babies and all that stuff and I know he's doing it for dramatic effect and it's one of the reasons why show is so popular because he does a lot of things like that.

Speaker 7:          00:57:11       It makes it easy for people to dismiss them. And then you get into this thing where, okay, let's, before you dismiss them, let's look at what he said. What is. He said that's true. And they look at what he said. Everything you said today so far, so far, everything that he said, it's just like his radio show. He doesn't have any teleprompters. This dude can talk for forever. That's a thing though, when you wind up doing a lot of podcasts, especially doing these radio shows, shows like Alex says by himself, we just ranting rants and rents for long periods of time. You develop like a certain muscle, like there's a lot of guys who do their own pod, like bill burr is a perfect example, does his own podcast by himself all the time and he's got this ability to go just rant from one subject to the next subject and keep going.

Speaker 7:          00:57:57       And when you have a podcast it's just, you just kinda gotta get out of his way. So with Alex you just kinda gotta feed them. Some subjects get out of his way, but every now and then he does so many subjects in a row. I got to bring them back. I gotta go, you gotTa. Okay, let's get to this one. How did she steal estates? You just can't gloss over that. Let's get to this. Okay, let's get to it. Broke it down per. He did a great job. Yeah, and this is a. I think this is going to help people have just seeing Alex like this is going to help people have a chance to look at this whole picture of just forget about where your loyalties lie, whether you enjoy CNN or Fox News or whatever, to just sit outside of it right now and look at what it really is because what it really is is why is anyone want to give you the news?

Speaker 7:          00:58:40       Are they giving you the news because they love you or are they giving you the news because it's a program and they're trying to make money and do they have access to certain people because they're willing to play certain games. Most likely when you're looking at something that's on a major league television show, whether it's Fox News or NBC or CBS or whatever the fuck it is, you had to go through some serious channels to get there. If you're a guy with a suit and a tie, good evening America and you're doing that guy, that guy on any of those major networks, you've had to go through some fucking serious hoops and ladders and checks and balances. You got to represent something in order to be the person who reads the news, but what is that news for? Is it a fucking show

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       or is it really the news? Are they really trying to help you? What are they trying to do with? Why? Why are they doing the news? Are they doing it because they love you and care for you and they want you to be informed or they're doing it because they're clearly biased and they've got an agenda? Well, if you watch Fox News and then CNN just go back and forth whenever there's something going on. Like how I did it after the election, I was like, Fox News, CNN, Fox News, CNN. It's who the fuck is telling the truth. Someone's gotta be lying. Why don't you Fox is lying. One of you is line because there's one story over here and it's a totally different story over here, so all you need to know, just looking at that, just forget about what you are, whether you're a progressive liberal, whether you're a conservative Republican.

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       Just look at that and understand that you're getting all of your information from these sources that have a vested interest in relaying their particular version of the truth. That's not good for anybody that represents the party. The party like Fox is totally get me one no matter what kid. Dude, come on. Get one for Eddie Bravo to. Let's get crazy. You bring out the hatchets. I hope that people listen to your show. The people that have never given them was a little nervous. I want to get going for was just do it. Bring out the whiskey all I want. Like for me, I don't want to be this conspiracy guy making money and doing shows. I walked away from my podcast. I was talking about conspiracies. I really don't want to be that conspiracy guy, but something inside me, uh, is, uh, wants to wake people up.

Speaker 2:          01:00:45       That's all I'm trying to do. That's all I'm trying to. I'm trying to help. I'm not making money off any conspiracy theories or anything. I tell myself every time I walk in here, don't say shit about conspiracies. Whiskeys going to bring it out of him, Bro. You know what I'm saying here when there was a big fan of yet. Oh cool. He said he wants to roll with you later. Oh Shit. Back Surgery. So you said so he said so you can kick his ass. Know Eddie just had a desk replaced. It's finally time to meet with the CIO, but every now and then don't you want to be like on that side and just have half full access? They don't see. I don't hold that whiskey hostile. Alex Jones. Alright listen, let me give you guys the big fricking data. I'm willing to give it to them. Okay. I mean I'm not bullshitting. I got the thing. Figure it out. Pour one for Eddie. I got to figure it out guys. If you want. I mean I'll pour a little.

Speaker 2:          01:01:37       Alright gentlemen. Cheers. I'm going to keep my mouth cheers to you. Alex Jones. Here's a good buddy. Stuff. People were so on one side or the other when it comes to this. There's so much anticipation regarding the. So much bullying. Don't have Alex Jones on it, but there was a lot of that. There's a lot of where you're going to call him on his racist shit. Someone said that to me, Alex Jones is one of the least racist people you'll ever meet in your life. I've never even heard you say a racial thing. Race is so inconsequential to you. I'm in what you think and what they stand for. You have never discussed race ever in the almost. What do I know you 16 fucking 17 years. I've never heard you discuss race at all, so someone calling you a racist, like

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       what? You just all they do all trump's waving a rainbow flag and say he's a homophobe. There was a guy walking next to me in New York. I was there after the election. I was there for the UFC. It was right after the election and me and my friend campaigns are walking back from the gym. We walked, we went over to the gym, we're walking back. We walked right into the fucking protest and there was this guy that was standing next to me screaming, Donald Trump KKK, racist, sexist. They had tied gay, gay, Gay, gay, racist, sexist, anti gay. He just kept screaming it out as Donald Trump's in the KKK is if John will trump, are you sure he's racist? Are you sure there's any discrimination hires? Gay guys are running casinos and hotels and is friends with them and like gave interviews with the advocate 20 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       It's all just complete. Made up horse crap. He's waving a rainbow flag at the RNC speech. He says, Republicans have to stop being mean to gay people and have to be inclusive and he's about to enforce civil rights laws for gays and others and they're calling him a literal homophobe. Then listen all it says my problem upside down, bs man visit, but this is my problem with it. My problem with it is that people want to use a real. You're a bigot. You're this, you're that. They want to come up with a nice quick label that officially makes them, but make sure that it boxes usually finds you and then you have to defend yourself. Look, you said it best at the beginning of this. Donald trump is not perfect. He's a man and he's also a super ambitious, super wealthy man. It's constantly on the go and those kinds of dudes are type a hyper aggressive personalities and he's definitely said some shit he shouldn't have said, right?

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       I mean, don't you agree? Like third we'll do this. The big one is one that he said in confidence with that billy Bush guy, the grab 'em by the pussy thing. That's the big one. Who has it in confidence, especially if you're famous, said, man, it's crazy. Women throw themselves on you. You can do anything you want. Sexual assault, a woman's climbing up on top of you. You can do whatever you want. That's what mammals do. She's showing she wants it. She gets it. A sexual assault. It's pure horse crap. Instead of a woman's said, yeah, I just, I could just see it in their eyes. I could just go up and grab them in the balls. We wouldn't. We wouldn't allow for fucking Briana. Briana just talked about how she can fuck any got. She wants just walks up to him, grabs by the deck.

Speaker 1:          01:04:30       We will be like total. We would think it's amazing. I started about group is he wasn't talking about that he hides behind bushes and reds for joggers reaches out and context out of context. He's having a guy conversation, right? Like he described it as locker room with the recorder, but I know I got this and this is not defending it. I mean, it's definitely not something you should have said probably. Right. We could all agree to that, but what is he really doing? He's really what we call talk and shit like Eddie Talk Shit so much to each of the laughing saying things we totally don't believe. We totally don't mean, but we're trying to make each other eventually. We're Lee. Eddie and I are silly all the time. You had a transcript of all the conversations. You and I have had a fucking 17 years.

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       We've been friends. Oh Shit. We'd be in trouble. Can't put it on air. We'd be in fucking real trouble. Real content on facebook mentions into that live video. You doesn't mean. It's so funny watching the stupid TV show. Oh my God. That show was awesome and then as soon as I turned the camera on, you wouldn't say all that stuff, but it wasn't. None of it was bad, but it was like off the cuff weren't, you know, you weren't censoring while I forgot what I said to a lot of marijuana involved in this conversation. Go on forever. Jesus. I'll put these off. You don't like them. You don't have to wear it so loud. You don't have to worry about it. Alex Jones, who's here. Seriously, I just want to do a good job and actually reached out to your 100 and 110 million. Who knows how many downloads a month?

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       20 million on Youtube. All the derivatives and everything else you're doing and I hear you sometimes on Xm. He still doing that? No, no, I'm not on the XML. Whatever the point is is that you're one of the biggest shows in the world. Let me give you a newsflash, not for your ego. Okay, but you need to know this. I don't see that as a signal to the mainstream media of apathetic. They are in top show has maybe a million viewers there. Average show about 100,000. Fox was top show, maybe 4 million to nine on a bigger night. Okay, great. Good for them. I'm not in competition with them. The point is there a freaking joke. I conservatively, everyday on terrestrial radio have $4 million listeners on my 200 plus stations. That's rated proven. I mean that's big right there and then millions and millions of downloads every day. Tens of millions of people watching the videos.

Speaker 1:          01:06:37       You've added all together 40 something million a week. We go back to this. What's happening? It isn't about Joe Rogan or Alex Jones Ready, Bravo or any of that. It's about the people are hungry for being able to have a wider selection of things. When you and I are totally different categories because all I'm trying to do is give them interesting content. You're actually trying to run a new show and expose to some really smart commentary. I'll watch clips all the time. I have people on all the time. It's just you try to open minds all the time, open mind the different way. I meant to say that what I'm not, I'm not honestly not trying to open minds, I'm being curious and I'm asking questions and I'm trying to learn as much myself and then once I do learn about things, I would like to have that person come on to teach other people about it because I think it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       Well, here's the big Enchilada for folks. If you want to lay the sound Chilada documentary down the road and actually break this down, but there is a whole breakaway civilization and I'm listening to Ufo getting ready. I don't ever talk about this for real breakaway civilization. Are you ready? Hold on. Joe. How many things that I tell you over the years? Too many to many. That came true. That was a couple that you got wrong. You can't get them all right. Which one? Two K people. The context. My list from that explained the white. It's okay. A conspiracy theory. It's just not trusting criminals. Every now and then you can in that murder to the criminal, but he still a criminal even though you're wrong. Well, one of the things that I'm actually embarrassed about is the y two k. oh, well, hey listen, you're not a consumer. You're not a computer expert. Near My. I didn't go anywhere that night. I stayed home and I was waiting for that God damn power to go out, have some big news in a minute, but since any rather than 12, I didn't know. I thought damn the Mayans. No, we thought it was over.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       I didn't think that any problem. And I was convinced 200,012 licensed to December 2012 licensed. I did. Oh, just tobacco. Yes. Very strong tobacco from Mexico. Oh, sorry. I'm in California. This is for medical reason. Hundred 100 percent medical reasons and legal. Um, yeah, I mean there's still, there's a lot of things if people think are going to happen that turned out to not happen. There's always a goddamn asteroid. It's going to kill us all. That doesn't actually. It's important to not inhale. So what? What is going on? Aliens are coming. Let me hear it. Let me, before I do this, let me answer his question because he got it. Reagan question to, well, let me answer y two k because I want to be bit honest about this. This was one of the few things that debt I have really gotten wrong and I didn't go with my gut and so I was proven wrong and I did it for the wrong reason.

Speaker 3:          01:09:06       So now I'm going to actually confess, your honor, I was on one radio station. I've been on TV for a few years. I was on one radio station already started to show it to my house that was on like 15 radio stations, so I had that at least, but I was on one big radio station, had the top show at night station with Howard stern was killer, was all over the newspaper, had huge ratings and I was bringing in like, you know, 20, 30 grand a month, which was just a huge amount for me. Building whole operation out of that at home. And they come to the sales guys and they go look for a year. You've not been behind y twoK and you're not letting us have all these big sponsors and you're gonna basically be fired if you don't let us endorse these sponsors and have them on errands.

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       Say You believe in y two k hold on a second. So these sponsors were like doomsday stuff like canned food and shit and bunkers. Everything else. So stacy wants to make all this money so the station made you push y two k y. But let me go further. This is one of the few times in my life that I don't want to say I didn't have integrity. I kinda let them convince me. But I think back to the point in the conference room I just Kinda went okay, okay, okay, sure. I get it. And then I went. And then once I decided it was true, I really pushed it. So it's almost like I lied to myself yet because I'm being honest about this process. So. So this is what happened for like a year and a half. I'm saying it's bs, it's a government hoax because they're like, the navy says the chips are all bad and 54 cities will completely fall and it's all the death.

Speaker 3:          01:10:30       And I said they just want to upgrade with all this new spy hubs and when a new global standardization for the US, it's the telecommunications act of [inaudible] 96, they want to force all the new chips because I had an NSA sources that I was having on. Okay. And I didn't realize how special it was that I had these sources and they're telling me it's all bs people. I don't argue with the navy and don't. Art and Fox News had ads to get your food. It was just everywhere. Someone kill. Okay, stuff's going to be real. So it's like a black Friday for black Friday sale. So the last few months and the moral was they ended up firing me anyways. They did. But the moral was, I kind of convinced myself it was real. So by the end of it, and of course they edit it like, you know, 12 hours and beyond that day, like five minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       I'm totally insane. But it's like nuclear reactor having a problem here and it really was happening and like, you know, oh, and there was a missile fired from Russia which was an icbm and they got shot down. That was ABC News. So I'm like, alright, this isn't really happening. Okay. Know we got prepared. It's always good to prepare, but hopefully I'll get a reactor is having a problem. Okay. Some stuff's that. There was some outages and problems, but government and MSM had hyped it. Then they used it to demonize alternative media. Even then when it wasn't catastrophic. So my gut told me it was bs. It was bs. And so thank God I missed the whole 2012 thing. But still they said, Alex Jones says the world's ending the bureau 2012 where he really starts when I say it's all a load of crap, but I didn't criticize you when I saw you doing it. I said I was balls deep. And here's the thing.

Speaker 3:          01:12:01       It wasn't, it was the listers. They were pissed at me that I wouldn't go into this thing. But it's fun for them. See, when you start talking about the end of the world are doomsday come and people like that shit because it gives them something to think about, but I guess here's a lot of people out future you. It was a long time ago, 17 years ago, right? Y, twoK , 17 fucking years ago at least 2012. Didn't get you redeemed yourself. You can think about 17 years ago. That's a long time ago. I mean in you getting fired from that job. Every great radio guys gotten fired. You Howard stern got fired. You got fired like public loves, but it was just like Howard stern fire man, top ratings, and they were all pissed and weird about it. The weird thing is they didn't mess with the losers.

Speaker 3:          01:12:48       They were all flipping out because I was getting the big paychecks. Well, it makes sense. It was the same day and the y two k thing totally makes sense that they would want you to really push that and sell it hard because he the fuck the hoes, you know, we don't know. You get scared. You're like, well, the navy says it's going to happen in Washington Post now your listers are real, and it was the one time I went, oh, okay, maybe I'll go do it. I had people on there were telling me there was something that was going to happen on 2012. They were sure of it. Yeah, not a bullied by doing it. You started stampeding like limits. I'm telling you this, a psychological going on, just massive double crossing because I really used to be in the Ufos, but the more you look into the Ufo is it looks like, and that's another conspiracy.

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       Looks like the government NASA deal. And when he came into the meeting he couldn't do it. I knew this guy well and then the next time he was going to meet with me, he. His heart blew up. It blew up. Yeah, like a bomb. They said his heart completely ruptured. Well, the point is, his name was Raymond t and if you look at mission control, he was the main guy as you control the control, the cameras and everything. And he, he was house. He had national security letters from the president. He'd run like secret operations in Cambodia and Laos. He was an air force engineer and uh, he, he knew the whole deal and he would say, what whole day would you say to meet with you and tell you everything? And he would

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       come and start gulping and he couldn't get it out, couldn't get one out. He said he was so threatened or whatever. He couldn't tell me about you think about it. He probably, he probably left and he was in the car. Raymond was telling me a lot. He said, Alex, your sources are right. There were advanced technologies. We were worried the astronauts might die. They had two teams in orbit. One would the real ships. This is not a joke, Joe. Wait a minute. They had one wheel pose in an orbit and they were communicating with Kennedy and the government. Everybody and Nixon are gonna have this giant thing about Americans, number one and not have a backup plan of the astronauts die. Uh, put those headphones back on and lost your fucking mind, Scott, you into a corner. Hold on, let him finish there. So tell me what you're trying to say.

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       Are you trying to say that? So the United States government cheek was going to give me the secret of NASA. Okay. And then he couldn't ever get it out. He would get an order. Now the second program, they had a second program, but how do you know he died? And he told me before the heart attack in the middle of the hard time second. No, no. I met with him at the old sat command base. What did he actually tell you for work or not? What? What He. He told me. He said you're, you said from your analysis, your sources. You're dead on. I was in control of the video and radio communications and he was the Yoda Gvs. Watch him on TV. I mean it's very important that guy controlling the Canada mission control the two backups behind that. Are you kidding? Of course. The, the moon landings.

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       Are you kidding? Come on. Well, you raised it. You want them to know. Oh, come on. That's ridiculous. No, but that's why I don't trust the government. That's why I don't trust it because they ran, they didn't want to spend money, they ran a fake cop was just reentry devices and basic stuff in space and did shoot some of it, but then they had a real mission that put the reflectors, everything on the moon. We went to the moon. But there's no proof of that. So you believe. Well, you know that the uh, the Russian government with the secret space program, Alex, you know that the Russian government, you know that the Russian government put those lasers sight, those laser reflectors on the moon as well with unmanned probes. Yes. You know that right now there's still Chinese. The Chinese have a bunch. So that's not like the, there's, there's, there's weird evidence.

Speaker 4:          01:16:31       He went to them things that far away. Just kidding. Are you kidding? This Alex, you think they definitely went to the moon? They're just. The footage is fake. Is that what she thinks? You can't bring film back to the Van Allen Radiation Belt to get spots all over it, but we don't have film. What would lead us to believe that they definitely did it because they had rca cameras. There was interest on the amazing footage, right? Does amazing footage launch in space in case the real mission died. So who's in the fake loan should show you the real deal. What happened? Is there anything? US military is in advance. Okay. Okay. But let's let him go. Let him answer this. Heady. So we gotta you got to figure this out. So what you're saying is the one that we saw on TV with Neil Armstrong, one small step for man, that's all horse shit.

Speaker 4:          01:17:17       But the real one actually took place. They just couldn't get the film back. But Armstrong had been on real missions. So yes, he definitely been unreal missions but had. No, no, he wouldn't tell me all of it. He died before we met. The other dude was out on him the next day and his wife called my dad was friends with him. They said, no, no. The other guy. What's his name? Buzz Aldrin. I do no buzz Aldrin. Buzz Aldrin said, I want to come on your show and I and I, I'm not gonna get into all that heat. Oh know he lives here in La and one time I ran into them but I'll just leave it at that and he said, I want to come on your show. I said, all right, well come on. It's the only interview he said, and he goes, I'm going to tell you Alex, your audience alone.

Speaker 4:          01:17:52       He said there is an envelope just like 2001. It's on the Moon of Mars, the moon and it sending a transmission and it's all real and it's all Egypt and there's aliens and everything else and it's the only time he ever said it. What? Is there a clip of that pull up? Buzz Aldrin up. Pull that clip. Dude. It was online. ABC News the next day. So you see that. Do you think he was fucking with him? Do you think he's fucking with you know, he was real. He's a feisty fella. I think he's full of Shit. Why do you think he's full of Shit? What if it's true? He imagined there is an obelisk on Mars. I think that's really is communicating with an obelisk on the moon and Mars. The Moon of Mars Phobos is that we got to land there. Did have been seen as instagram, but that was a good lot of bitches. Amazing boats to follow him. Poaches and bitches and boats. He's just like, he's this. Okay, well let's take it. Let's give some loving instagram. Let's give some

Speaker 2:          01:18:51       with their habitation. We can keep track if there's something very important to be developed from the moon. I'm not sure what it is right now. Of course you don't. Sure. Thanks. Should identify it for.

Speaker 4:          01:19:03       Well, the truth. No, no, no. I want to hear what he's doing here about. I want to hear, but I want to hear what he says first. Let's see what he says. Hold it. Hold it. Go ahead. Jamie.

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       America. To make such gross expenditures again for human habitation on a boat, we can help. We can join with together. We can explore the moon and develop the movement. Still. Tax Money. Go do it together. Oh, Bill Shan has not gone before this where he talks about that we need to go to a monolith there. A very unusual structure, little potato shaped object. We need $4,000,000 to in seven hours. Find out about that. They're going to say, who put that there? Who put that there? Well, the universe put it there. If you choose combine and put it there. Come on

Speaker 4:          01:19:58       wants $4,000,000,000. Oh my God. So that's the monolith. That thing that you're looking at at. Wow. That's weird. I don't believe that shit for a second. Let me tell you about Buzz Aldrin here in Los Angeles and I can't tell you anything else. Okay. Look at this monolith on Phobos. Weird. Yeah. That's took a weird structure. Who knows? That's a real picture. That's all bullshit. It's all bullshit. Come on. Yeah, that, that proves it. Planes are all bullshit. I can. I don't know shit about photoshop and I can make that. I'm sure you can. I tell you the big secret about my secret meeting with me here. The shitty fed. You let me know. Eddie don't sign. Let's go ahead and let him communicate. He told me that Papa SMURF has for you. I'll show you what he told me. He told me, he said, you know India is sending a probe to the moon and they'll announce that when they crashed the probe, they found the undersea frozen ice that covers the moon.

Speaker 4:          01:21:00       The moon has dust on it. It's a big water bowl. It's gonna be the water we need to get off the planet. We make our big jump. So the whole point is, suppose everything's laid on the planet just perfect for humanity. We make the steps right, but it's like a video game. Puzzle and highlight. Fuck, Buzz Aldrin. No, you're not listening. He's fucking crash. The proud found exactly what they were saying and I'm walking through an airport or later to look over and it says, it says India discovers water on the moon and it's all water. Well, they've definitely discovered water on the moon. Right? That's what they told me about it a year before he sat. Right? Am I correct in saying there's no water in the moment saying Buzz Aldrin? Is he going to the meetings and they tell them shit. Listen, he. Yeah, he went to the moon.

Speaker 4:          01:21:42       You want to get to go to every meeting. I don't get into all this stuff. I'm telling you. Was older told me in a year it's going to be on the news that they discovered water with a probe or setting before they were even sending a probe in the news. They left India quote, find it because the US already found it. It's already been on the moon. God knows how many times the word is. They got military bases on the other side. Alex was in the fifties. What do you think we got now? So you think they have new? Wait a minute. They have bases on the moon. Well, I don't ever get into all of this stuff, right? Don't do that. But let's just say it's super advanced. You really think that they have some sort of a base out there and he's like, I told you one, a key word that's so far away.

Speaker 4:          01:22:19       Why wouldn't they just do it in a desert somewhere? What is this? Am I p detected water on the moon way back in June. Huh? It dropping dissemble on you, Alex. let me. Buzz Aldrin tells me they're gonna. Announce India finds water. Oh my God. Follow him on instagram and then come back to me with some bizarre probe with Buzz Aldrin. Me. Look at this. The moon impact probe. Which class crashed, landed at a designated site on the lunar South Pole on November 14, 2008. I had picked up some clear signatures of water during the five minutes to say crash it. Yeah. Mr. Nair said at a press conference here on Friday. Interesting when it comes to space, Alex. um, uh, that's not your forte. I. But one,

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       one thing I wanted to ask both alcorn this time I want to shit on instagram and then come back at me with his instagram. What's up with bottles? It's amazing. He's just like, he's a, he's slow. He's so into it. She, when the guy comes over, he goes, you're full of crap. You ever went to the money? Just punches him. Hey, check this out. I wanted to ask you, what do you. What do you think is trump going to do anything about the stratospheric aerosol injection? I write that down because we were talking about stratospheric aerosol injection. Can't get to the points that you want. Let me know. What do you think trump wants to stop that. I'm going to chuck write it down. Write that down, but the next question, I'll do it here. That's the question. The question he just said was five before the Alex Jones is off the rails right now, but I didn't get the job. Why don't we have to write it down? I didn't get it because you've been bad listening.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       Will trump. Is trump going to do anything about that, that program to stop, but what do you. What do you think the program is ending? What do you think the program, the director of the CIA, he's talking about it on Youtube. Look on your job, John. Oh, Brenda. Talk about strategies, strategies, solid injections. It's going to cost $10,000,000,000 a year and there's going to be some countries opposed to it because it's going to mess up the atmospheric manipulation and I'm talking about stratospheric. I've never heard of that. It's super important when you can break it down to three letters yet. Let's go to John. Oh, Brennan admitted last in June of 2016 at the video and comment on it. Can you play a jamie? John O'Brien talking about this forever. I'm not. I'm not bashing you, but you entertaining show my jokes about it, which I get because a lot of it's.

Speaker 2:          01:25:03       Yes, there is an entire atmospheric terraforming geoengineering manipulation. I don't call it chem trails and of course the CIA director admitted. They have this huge program. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation owns the major patents on it from Westinghouse and others. They use these big antennas to manipulate the weather. They can. China's like causing huge harp like technology. It's all declassified. Think heart manipulates the. Whether they admit it does. I used to have the hand of Heart, general bitten k part. Not all the time, but the. Exactly. There's giant weather modification systems and there's weather wars between different governments and they. It's all declasse. Explain to people that are listening, what harp is, what does it stand for? High altitude something. Yeah. They've got a system that supposedly you don't know what really was under classification. What does it stand for? High frequency active auroral research programs. So the idea behind this was they wanted to do research on the Aurora and didn't they want to see if they could communicate using it and sending radio waves? Horizon Radar, right?

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       Yeah. That and they also wanted to be able to send radio signals to places where they wouldn't really know. What does that have to do with stratospheric aerosol and just really go into the atmosphere. Well, the speculation this. I've interviewed the private head of it. Okay. I'm to let him on my work with the hottest harp work with the chem trails. What do they let me check goes on? Only A. my chronic amount of small amount of what harp does is in the atmosphere. It's bouncing off the Aurora borealis and then resonating back through in a, in a deep earth, a communication program to satellites and other things through the planet, so it's something she can communicate with satellites through the satellites, down to the submarines. So here it goes. This is an actual business definition. How harp works. The facilities transmitters send radio waves according to hold on.

Speaker 4:          01:26:57       Let's just read it. First waves upwards into the ionosphere between 100 and 350 kilometers altitude. The resulting heating effect creates irregularities and the electron density there, which in turn allows communication signals as from satellites to be relayed off the ionosphere. That's not what it really does. Then they can shoot the shadow light frequency coded through the Earth to submarines. Now, what is this website from there? The Jamie bully. You want the real stuff? I'll tell you. Yeah, sure. Okay. Let me explain something. Okay. Dot Com. I had the head of the heart program on just fucking. I got contacted about 10 years ago and they said the head of the Hart project really lecture work. He liked to come on interviews online. He liked to come on and tell everybody, and about 30 minutes in a colonel came on the line and said, sorry, during a break and cut the guy off.

Speaker 4:          01:27:47       Well, I mean this really happened. Q spooky music cue, spooky music, but I believe you. That's a true story. I want to know. I want to know that I want another relationship between like what are the chem trails have to do? Do you think trump is going to look into the SIA project at the CIA has green lit. He is starting out with vaccines. As I told people he would do investigating and all the damage they've caused. The ultimate. That's good to start the vaccines. Get that shit together too, for sure, but what about the SAI programs that the CIA has greenlit? You think he's going to get into that next level? Said, we want him to communicate with these microphones. Internet shouldn't be like, you're so locked onto this. Here's the problem with all this asset shit. Most of what you see when you see those jets flying around those clouds behind them, most of that is just a fringe in exactly the infusers that with a real program. What's the real progress? Well, here's the thing. You're right, and so his job, because the world is complex, there are secret and clauses, secret and public programs to test manipulation of the weather and weather systems. The Arabs are doing it, the Chinese are doing it. The Russians are doing people being cloud seeding for a hundred years now

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       whether manipulation, but they're doing it for different purposes in that not to produce. Right. I had been living keep going. The head of the US weather weapon program for 27 years on my show first because I saw it was he. I saw that he was in the panhandle of Texas. I called him running a major cloud seeding company with his son and got the 90 year old to Austin and then after that he totally freaked out because the cio came to his house. Do you want the interviews on Youtube? Do you want to know what he said? Yes, he was a world war two fighter pilot and I said at the end of World War Two, he flew the first planes and hurricanes in the Atlantic. That's pretty gangster and into typhoons that are even faster in the Pacific and then he and then he also let squadrons in Vietnam flooding everything up to 10 feet of water out of clear blue skies with an hour's work with, with their, with their chemicals pass.

Speaker 3:          01:29:56       You have to be to do that. It's super bad ass. Fly into a hurricane or a typhoon Jesus. He's the first guy to do it. Holy Shit. Anyways, he's super bad ass. I don't know. He's alive. He's been living at 90. He was still all there and I thought not to kicked my ass is big texts and I felt like I was. The guy was with me anyways, so. So we're sitting there and he gives me all this data and I can't believe and he showed me all these classified photos and stuff because they just, he classified the file. No one thought to call the old man from Lubbock or whatever it was. Right? So I call him, I get him on, they sent a bunch of people that their company and threatened them the next week after I heard it and he laid it out. He said in 1967 when we certified at the Stanford Research Institute, he was able to control hurricanes, create hurricanes and steer hurricanes.

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       All that got black budgeted shut down. And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas and out of that, and Westinghouse came, came the, uh, the, the whole heart program show in the sixties. They could create control and steer or kill hurricanes. That's why you google now. Bill and Melinda Gates bought all those patents and the quote, Bill Gates is going to save the world from bad weather. Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes googling. So I. So let me build the weather machine. Let me pause for a second. How does the, how do, how do they manipulate a hurricane? So the hurricane's going to happen, how do they break it up? Okay. If it's was coming into lands there, problem with with Ariel arrays, projecting into the sky, they can break it up or strengthen it or kill it or steer it because it's all negative.

Speaker 3:          01:31:20       I miss doing that with harp will. They've got. They've got heart bases all over the place. They call them doppler radar facilities. Oh, the government. Once your local city, they have doppler radar. I thought that was so you could have a guy in front of the window. The script, that's it. Like one 10th of one percent. They can crank those arrays up that have a massive. Your lights might go when they do it a little bit. Yeah, because they'll use the whole power of your town through the doppler radars and then they control it. The US has a giant weather weapon hidden in front of everybody and every time it's city and poor Russians and Chinese are just discovering. All the US has weather weapons that can knock them all out. Right now, Bill Gate's control, the weather ideas for barges to pump water from the depth

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       of the ocean to create some sort of a roadblock for the hurricane. Since her gains pull power from the water's warm, temperature is cooling, the water could have theoretically, theoretically dismantle the hurricane. Well, it sounds like a good idea though. None of the deployment is loving is it? Doesn't that sound like a genius idea? You spray cold water until the trails. O'Brien Brennan in the front of the CFR is saying, we were doing this because for global warming and we got to save them about about geoengineering. Chem trails. You were wrong about the dinosaurs. Not being rude, but hey, what about that? They're. They're coming out saying, hey, there's gonna. Be some countries that don't. That aren't going to be for it. We got to figure out how we're going to deal with them because you want me to have the audience. The big cigarette. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:32:49       Was the big relation. Keep going with that. Come on, man. Don't change the subject. Keep going with that. You're not done with Livingston. Imagine you're here, but imagine that me and Joe were actually. You got me off on. You want me here about Ronald Reagan to later finish the s a. He doesn't know about this, but it's a minor deal. What do you know about the SSI program? Look, let's get this done. When most of the real programs are just like fronts for something else, it's not even real. So you don't think they're spraying shit into the atmosphere? No. There is a program for Geo Engineering. There's a program in place and you just said it's the doppler radar system and harp and what else and an aerial spraying still the most effective and what do they do? They do have pat. When you say an aerial spraying, what are they spraying?

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       Barium salts. Alumina oxide. Radioactive isotopes in the air balloon was because because it does a bunch of things, they're testing a bunch of stuff. They're they're. They're manipulating things. Listen, our pedagogy, why do you have evidence that they're doing this and spraying aluminum and Barium, whatever it is in line and the Department of Energy. It's all public. Just like he just go online and watch the Chinese dude get jacked by a tiger. That's great. That's how to go to the Department of Energy Dot Gov and you can watch cfr. CIA director at the time, Brendan it admitting all this. This is all public. Yeah. He talked about, but he'd know. I saw it. I saw the video. We could play the video and go over it if you want, but he's talking about various options for controlling global warming. They're laying out the future. Look, if global warming is a guy.

Speaker 1:          01:34:18       Hold on, hold on a second. If global warming is real, we know it is right. Don't you think they would have? You don't believe global warming is real. Keep measuring these temperatures and scientists keep saying, okay, well let's find out. Let's find out what the real. Okay. I believed that it was high. It goes cold. There's always micro temperature change this shift. She was the only thing that ever happened that's taxes to Al Gore won't fix it. Okay. I think we all agree that the shifts, but what I'm saying is there absolutely is global warming, right? What is the CEO? The second talking house. When my dad

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       was a kid, the 19 fifties for three or four months out of the year, it was below zero or freezing and you had to chop wood and he'd freeze your ass off and all houses had, even in the south had, had, you know, had all sorts of chimneys and um, for fireplaces because it was freezing cold and now there has been a warming period, but that's part of a normal global cycle based on the sun. All these astrophysicist or. Sure. The whole thing about claiming it's the carbon we put out the earth is carbon star. There's a carbon cycle. That's the big story I want to get to the globalist. Want to tax if they can tax oxygen, carbon dioxide, water or sunlight, they have total control over the whole life cycle of the planet. Well, let's play the video. Let's play the video. This, this CIA guy talking about it because what I inferred from and trying to come up with some sort of solutions, if global warming becomes a giant, White Brennan is a fricking known.

Speaker 7:          01:35:47       What hobbyist would show Joe? What is the CIA that's watch the video for global warming? It's a good question. What do they have to do? I don't know what the CIA does. Due Diligence. They were never built that stop the spread of communism, but it's an intelligence agency. They're part of the environment. Okay. They were a part of the intelligence community and if they got hired, I would imagine. This is just me guessing right off the top of my head. If they got hired to assess a threat and a threat being from global warming, like what? What do we have to worry about? Are we really going to lose cities? Do we really have an issue? Goes Down, give George Soros and the UN total power for a 100 trillion per decade. Global tax to micromanaging, surveil everything humans do. Let's say is if carbons toxic, they've got to surveil it.

Speaker 7:          01:36:31       Thus they have a jurisdiction to control our lives. Okay. Hold on. Why does it say debunked? CIA director admits chem trails, geoengineering, stratospheric aerosol injections. Uh, so it says the claim guys, hold on, hold on. At the counsel admits geoengineering in the form of stratospheric aerosol injections. Sai is taking a place I eat. Kempter is taking place it chem trails, and the rebuttal is nowhere in his speech. Is there an admission that an sai program has already taken place? The part where Brendan mentioned geoengineering is just one example. Out of several not often mentioned issues with the CIA monitors for potential elements of instability in the world. A ski program, if ever implemented, could penetrate conflicts and security threats if misused. The CIA's jobs to consider all types of concepts, concepts for potential future problems and threats, including the science oriented concepts. That's totally. Let me break down the right, but isn't that possible? And we're done. But what that guy just said, is that possible? No. That's basically what Brendan said, but what he's saying is that there are potential threats. He only. Mentally, it's an issue, right? So he's not admitting that he had. There's an Sar, but let me. Let me tell you. Okay, go ahead. Tell me everybody debates how many programs there are, all the specifics. A lot of that's classical. Fuck. You can google Shyna launches, major weather control operations 10 years ago, right? Or

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Qatar does it, or Saudi Arabia or UK or for sure people have studied. No, no, no, there's. They call it study. There was a giant hell in 2005. The Department of Energy Program for Aerosol testing was $5 million a year. So under US Code Title Fifty Chapter Thirty Two subsection 1,528, paragraph B. is that true? You nailed that, right? Yes, yes. From under US code. Do you live on that obelisk? That was fucking insane. Let me just tell you. I get into. Remember the time last time with Cheetah fought under us. Code title, Finish Number Thirty 2,528, paragraph B. that's. That's insane. Under that, say it's slow that Jamie. Write it up. Jaylin was code title 50 chapter. I say it fast. Remember us code title 50 chapters, Statute Section 1,528, paragraph eight, subsection 128. The real fast brand fact speed. Kenya speech came and say it. It's like one thought. Jesus us code section one.

Speaker 3:          01:38:56       There's restrictions on use of human subjects for testing of chem trails. Go, go back, go back, back. There you go. Or biological agents, right now, what they do in this is they say it's illegal to test unless it's for research. Then you're allowed to kill people. It was for research purpose. You know, that's how some of those Japanese whaler vessels get away with killing whales. Still. They say it's for research purposes and they kill the whales and seldom dark shit. The elites, the elites are the mad scientist engineers. I'm gonna. Give you the big secret man if you want to do. I'm not kidding around. I know I'm not eating. The thing is they call their the high priests. They're scientists, they're engineers. They're allowed to kill people. Test stuff on kids and jet black people with syphilis, all the declassified stuff because they are scientists.

Speaker 3:          01:39:44       All the real executioners tortures or most of them were people making decisions are doctors and so it's all medical doctor stuff in this big breakaway civilization of scientist. Okay? And so that's what they've built and under, under under researched provisions, they could even kill anybody. They want. All right, I'm going to go back because we took Eddie turn on chem trails, but we did it to side track from what you were saying about the moon and I want to go back to what you're saying because you were saying that there was two completely different missions and one of them was real and that there was some sort of contact with aliens. No, I was getting to that or I'm saying I had a top. Is that what you were implying? Taught? Well, well, let's just say this. It's mind blowing. I was told by a top NASA individual, Raymond Tig that indeed there was a breakaway program and that he heard and saw transmissions on some back channels of real feeds and advanced ships that he'd never even seen that basically didn't even look like they were anything that he could imagine that was classified and he knew about some classified programs for every program you saw, there was at least 10 programs that were sacred.

Speaker 3:          01:40:48       That's a bit about NASA. Ninety percent sacred or more, and so he knew about a cloud, a bunch classified programs, and he was shaking

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       transmissions and things coming back and talk to people about a whole breakaway program they sent. That was a lot safer, a lot bigger than the moon. Then they had guys up in orbit just basically so that even other foreign governments from the trajectory point, we think they were getting transmissions back from the moon. So they had people out basically out outside of the regular orbit. We just go around in circles or is it geosynchronous where you're in one spot transmitting back from mathematical spot to look like transmissions to full directions and everybody, all the real mission was going on, uh, on the moon. So you believe they went to the moon, do you think that it was buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong, clickonomy everything. He died. He said, I'm going to meet with you tomorrow. And he done too. That's like a movie. He told me I'm ready.

Speaker 1:          01:41:38       I'm going to tell you everything. And then he was just totally, it was crazy. But he did admit to you that, uh, what the public got was fake. Yeah. He, he couldn't get into it. Well, there's some footage from the moon that looks so ridiculous and most people have never seen some footage of them that. Here's, here's the big speculation. This is one of the really big ones was that there was a lot of footage that they did where they were doing tests that they wound up just using for press releases. They using like to say this is actual footage on the right stuff for the project because they wanted to be guaranteed of it, the real truth. But there was a thing with Michael Collins, Gemini Fifteen, there was a test photo of him with like a test rig on and it was like suspended and you can see the background behind him.

Speaker 1:          01:42:26       It was clear that he was suspended on wires and they took that same photo in, blacked it out and used it as a press photo of him on an actual space walk. But it's the same exact photo stuff. Yeah. They do that where they just go over it with it back then. And you see you actually use an exact domain. Here's the thing, my dad, when he was just like a junior in high school, was in the plan to program at ut and they already had cd roms and computers and they had a nuclear, a plant under, but nobody knew about it. My Dad going about this when I was a teenager and I would like later go to the library, couldn't find it, and then I googled it. It's not even really in the news, but I've gone to ut and talked to them and I go, yeah, you know about the reactor, the building reactor that Austin's got.

Speaker 1:          01:43:06       And then no one even knew that Austin has two nuclear reactors in North Austin. What? Yeah. But the poem was my. That was for you. That was after he was in college. They built a reactor under which building in Austin, Texas. It's big. It's a big railway system under there, but it's, it's built right under, right under, like I said, gesture. So there's a nuclear reactor in Austin, Texas. How many people know about this? You know, it's in the literature and my dad told me about it when I was a kid. I thought, I mean, I believe my dad, my dad told me about Dallas hospital that was killing people for their organs for like six years later. I saw it on 60 minutes. Why? They were killing people for organs. Really. My Dad told me about that in Dallas, Texas on 60 minutes. Yeah. My Dad said when I was 16 years

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       ago or 15 taken driver's course, she said, don't sign that organ donor card. I know hospitals that kill you. Jesus. And I said, dad, you're kidding. He goes, no. He was an oral surgeon and rewired jaws because I've heard this one killed people all the time. Is one of the creepiest things you ever. Can you imagine doctors that get kickbacks for Oregon's. They kind of let the see stars are seen as the highest caste, but the elite, so they're the ones pulling all the stuff. I'm telling you, man, you know how creepy it would be like to find out that a nurse that you were working with was killing people, but that's a story that happens over and over until the crazy smart killer. There's been a bunch they get. They get. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. These nurses that say nurses decide they don't want to take care of somebody and they poisoned them.

Speaker 4:          01:44:32       They. They have someone that maybe someone's dying slow and they don't like it and they just get tired of dealing with their bullshit some of the time. The district. Oh yeah. A lot of the times, their sadistic. There's been a lot worse than I have about facts. You're absolutely on target. You don't. It's no worse than everything. Everything I know and you're on target. You just pretend you're not. No one just knew that document off the top of your head like that. So rain man. I must have been obsessed with chem trails, right? No. I know a bunch of other. He's got a crazy mind. Had a photographic memory. Tell us about 35 and now it's not good anymore. Steals that from me, stuff I remember, but I, I want to tell you guys the big enchilada. Please. The Big Enchilada. Wear these headphones. No. Well, the problem is when we don't have headphones on, we talk over each other.

Speaker 4:          01:45:21       It's hard when three people are talking, you know, it's just, you know, it's none of our fault. It's just natural. The conspiracy. You, you're, you are Bill Hicks, Huh? No, I'm younger than him. Totally different. I love how I haven't had any success. It's all Bill Hicks. He was a funny guy, but give me a fricking break, man. Listen to those families call me before and said, please stop the people saying your Bill Hicks and all these damn people. Don't worry about that. Put the headphones back on. Sorry. We have to be fine. So I need to know. I need to know what do you know about aliens and how much are aliens? Real. Alright, let. This is really big. So. Okay. Put another shot of that media at the south property. The question is, what does Donald Trump know about? Oh yeah, it was. He know now, right?

Speaker 4:          01:46:05       Because he's in the office. That would be the first thing. I think that Joe Rogen experience deserves it. That's the first thing I did. I would run to the office and I'd go, who's got the documents? Who's got the alien documents? Who's got them? Who's got them? That would be the first thing I would want to know. Right. Cheers sir. Boring Shit. I got to piss too. You're a robot. You never have to piss 'em. Alright. Let me give you my best please. Deep research approximation once. What do you think is going? But it. Am I wrong to his. Still hold out. Hope that aliens are real because I tell you has one. The two guilty pleasures that I still cling to his big foot and aliens. Those are two big foot. Not so much. I wish it was real, but I just don't. Yes. Big Wood Trim.

Speaker 7:          01:46:50       No. Come on Daddy. No. Are you ready? Yes. I'm gonna. Give you the big enchilada. Joe. There are aliens in this room right now for real? Yeah. You're not of this world, Bro. Me, you're the alien. Oh Wow. I didn't know. It's like, um, there was like an old comic book about that, about some dude who was a forgetful professor and then he realized at the end of it he was actually an alien from another planet that's sent down here to monitor people. He just forgot, well, here's what the elite belief, and let me be very clear as to what. He'll tell you some context. I only go with what I can prove. Oh, thank you. And people can't even handle that. Okay. Well, I'm really surprised how much you knew every angle of so called pizza gate that I even forgot. Well, it's to meet. Well, obviously we both have children and when you hear about someone that wants to molest children, it's a special kind of evil to special and it's.

Speaker 7:          01:47:39       And it's also a special kind of bizarre, twisted sickness that the human mind is capable of latching onto the programming to want to take care of kids and be nice to them. There's something very crazy about people's brains and there's something very crazy about the weird variables that can potentially happen. I agree with all sorts of weird, crazy aberrations in standard behavior. You know like this, the standard behavior of bunch of people that are just normal folks. You got kids. I got kids. Oh, get the kids together for a play date. You sit down and you have a couple of beers. You laugh. You Joe, have a good night. Bob Guyton. Steve. That's fucking normal shit right? When you're normal and there's normal people around you, you assume that everybody is basically a good person. We all have our problems. Normal that your wife comes into the bedroom.

Speaker 7:          01:48:24       She, you get going. You don't look at a five year old and think that's what I want. No, there's some were trying to say is there's some people out there that have this horrific programming. Whatever the fuck it is that causes it as a bunch of psychologists trying to speculate and figure out what causes to be beat in the head with a ball pin hammer. The thing is it's real and it's. It's terrifying. Candida. It's going on. We can't deny it's real and it's also like fucking jared from subway, the subway guy, the subway guys in jail for being a pedophile and they fuck they came up and they usually have high intelligence and there's armies were fighting a pedophile conspiracy, but beyond that it's a vampire conspiracy and that they are interdimensionally sucking the essence of our youth and they believe they're possessed by an off world entity.

Speaker 7:          01:49:09       They do. Yeah. And Joe, I've been on air 22 years. I don't get into aliens, metaphysical religion, any of that. I've studied the elite and I've also communicated with a lot of the top people and, and, and if you want to know, I will actually break down right now the best knowledge right now. What's happening on the planet, what's happening? Let me give you a basic. Just sculpt. Okay? I love when you can use that word with full confidence. I've never said that. Let me give you a basic gestalt. I'd be like, oh my God, it's such a fraud. No, you're not, you know, but that's what I would think if I use that word now you'll get all this shit you already have. Most of the static is you're a bookworm or research warm and a good way. The elite are all about transcendence

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       and living forever and the secrets of the universe and they want to know all this. Some are good, some are bad, some are a mix, but the good ones don't ever want to organize the battles and want to organize because they lost after power. Powerful consciousness don't want to dominate other people. They want to empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game. Then they come together. Evils always defeated because good is so much stronger and we're on this planet and Einstein's physics shut at. Max Planck says, shut her off. There's at least 12 dimensions and now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming out saying it's a false hologram. It is artificial. The computers are scanning and and finding tension points where it's artificially projected and gravity's bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call it.

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       Dark matter, so we're like a thought or a dream that's a whisk in some computer program, some God's mind, whatever they're approving it all. It's all coming out now. There's like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension that's just turned over. The most horrible things is what it resonates to and it's trying to get up into the third dimension. That's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels and our species is already way up at the fifth, sixth dimension, consciously our best people, but there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity because humanity has free will and there's a decision to which level we want to go to. We have freewill, so evil is allowed to come and content not just good and the athletes themselves believe they're racing. We using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines, transcend and breakaway from the failed species.

Speaker 3:          01:51:30       That is man, which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad. Projecting it onto themselves instead of believing notes, a human test about building us up, and so google was set up 18, 19 years ago. This was. I knew about this before it was declassified. I'm just saying I've good sources that they wanted to build a giant artificial system and Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a super computer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into it with the Internet of things and so all of our thoughts go into it and we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers a true crystal ball.

Speaker 3:          01:52:19       But the big secret is once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know. And a true two point, oh, in a very bad way. Hive mind consciousness with an ai jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us, not in some pkd wire head system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure, but because we were already wired in and absorbed before we knew it, by giving over our consciousness to the system, our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system. There's now a human counterstrike taking place to shut this off before it gets fully into place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are control of this ai system before humanity is destroyed.

Speaker 3:          01:53:13       Wait a minute, is only controlled of Ai. How'd they get had the pedophiles getting control of the pet, the pedophiles at, uh, at whatever level rule the devil, whatever you want to call it. This interdimensional thing that gives them advanced offworld technology. The fallen one that's not of this world is giving them advanced systems have been used before on other populations. What that Satan. But what are you talking about? Let's say explain that you just see something, something that you know the stupid preacher tells you about who's totally controlled or something you read about in the news or TV, right? This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence us to build something that absorbs us and kills us rather than the divine. A freewill we're given to build something much better than empowers the species. So the species is now making a decision on its entire future.

Speaker 3:          01:54:02       When you're getting this from, from that, that's what it is. But where are you getting it? I know from, from looking at all the data, researching and studying it, watching the enemy, that's the big decision that humanity has now got before us. So if you were directing someone to investigate this on their own, how would they do that? So if you say, here's the problem, you get someplace. Finally in deep research where it's what every culture already said, what everybody already knew, what they're telling you. A movies like promethium, what the elite admit the New York Times they believe in is this, you know, a seated by offworld systems. Panspermia, yes. Everything, everything. They're doing points towards this and then you read their own writings. They believe we're this ugly, fallen, ugly species. We're all going to be killed there. The rich billionaires who are better than us and they're going to merge with machines and become gods and go to the next level.

Speaker 3:          01:54:50       Don't you think that most people who extrapolate from where we stand today with our cell phones and our apple watches and our integration with the computer and the Internet constantly, don't you think that most people see that there's going to be some sort of symbiotic connection? It's a very easy thing. They were saying it before. I understand, but a lot of people were saying, but here's a problem. Who engineered what we were given? What is the point of the back door at the Trojan horses? Hey, here's what I'm Jenny who engineered what? Here's what. Here's what I'm telling you. The elite, the elite literally believe interdimensionally. They were given this information and then built it and here's the thing. They built it and Google admits he would have data dumps to wire two years ago that they're building an ai that will in human consciousness freewill and take over and the next species will rise out of that. They've already decided. Our species people have been taught. Marshall Mcluhan was talking about that 50 fucking ago. Here's the old. They

Speaker 7:          01:55:44       built it Amazon two years ago at mets. They can already with 99 percent certainty pick what their regular users are going to order. Alex, before they hold on a second, ready instead of dragging this out to some nefarious end, isn't it entirely possible that all these futurists, all these technological innovators, they all see the same end game if there's going to be some sort of a complete integration between people, but it's the artificial intelligence that historically everybody saw this coming, right, and so this big, all the futurists, all the people that started in the future before a silicon chips were created. The point Marshall Mcluhan, I think it was in the 1970 said that human beings are the sex organs of the machine world, and he was saying even back then that human beings are eventually going to integrate or become something that's a part of telling you is there's a centralized system of what they're building that isn't naturally occurs.

Speaker 7:          01:56:38       Who is that? Where artificial he was doing the elitch believe they're getting off world building. These things that you're just describing right now. I mean if you actually read with all the global is say you've obviously read their writings, you know this show, they are getting knocked off world, but interdimensional communications to build this system that we see lowers our ICU, makes us live less. I've never asked is okay, but when you're making these big statements, they've getting into dimensional signals is telling them to create these systems that lower iqs. That's something you got to really prove. Like if there's. Okay, please. If there's something you can show all the studies show screen time, all the computers, lowering our as lowing fertility must be right there. Was that a case? Is that a case of a somebody's holding a gun to your head? Let me tell you about me.

Speaker 7:          01:57:25       I'm addicted to this God damn thing. I love watching videos. I love. I love taking pictures and shit. I love looking at humanity. There's a lot of beautiful things he does, but I'll tell you, they're very addictive. Very addictive. So. But hold on a second. Let me stop you right there. I don't necessarily think that's engineered to be addictive. I think it's engineered to be really well and the fact work really well and the fact that it works really well is very addictive. Just like little kids look at a screen, you put a fucking television in front of them when they're one year old and play some stupid commercial and they're like, whoa, Joe. They picked a second. No, they don't. They made a better. Hold on a second. They made better and better technology that we're not designed to absorb. Human beings have exactly set through.

Speaker 7:          01:58:06       At the moment we have the exact same DNA that we did 10,000 years of the Atlantic when there was nothing like television. There was nothing like movies, there was nothing like stereo headphones and project, but don't go on. You're crazy when you're interrupted. My crazy rant. I am telling you that this is a natural progression of this massive infatuation that we have with technology. They don't have to engineer it. It's natural. It happens to you. It happens to me. Happens to anybody who's looking at cooler and cooler. Special effects in movies. All that stuff is a natural. Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids play with an ipad. Well then he's a cunt.

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       He's a cunt. Let your kids play with. Fuck's wrong. That right ran. I'm not disagreeing with you. Interrupted it 10 times. You fuck. Oh, I'm to let a motherfucker rant. Rant, rant, rant. Then I'm done. Now. Shit, they're going to get back to this. We're not talking about the weather. It can tell you that right now. Let me tell you right now. Let me tell you right now. Fuck. Cloud. Let me tell you. I'm trying to break this down. The whole thing is being set up to control. Okay? What I'm telling you when you're talking about the elites and interdimensional signals that they're receiving, they're telling us to lower Iq. You can't just say that. Need proof. Okay. Let me give you a proof. That sounds so crazy by the way, Miriam. Yeah. Oh, that sounds so crazy. I wonder where the aliens was. They honor.

Speaker 4:          01:59:23       You know what? It's really cool to say the computer simulation, but it talks about that. Everyone says no, but they're saying that will be easily, easily pitch. Oh yeah, we're in a computer simulation, but then when you talk about interdimensional like magical shit, like, wait a minute. Exactly. Magic is a technology that hasn't been discovered yet. Exactly, and that's what these videos are fucking magic for you and we. You and I could do this right now and we could go like here. We'll do it right now. This is what's what we're going to do. We're going to go right now. You want to talk some magic because this really is fucking magic. We're going to do instagram live right now. We're not instagram live. We're doing like one of those little instagram stories is a whole new, a whole new thing. Young Jamie, am I right? Fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:00:15       This isn't live yet. Oh, occasionally I did, but I. You go a little longer than you. Let me go on. What's that? We're going to go to Alex. got to piss again. Go past all these lightweights. I'm just drinking coffee. I drank one of these kill cliff coffees. I drank one order of a butter coffee. I'm drinking this Erewhon conspiracy. It's a conspiracy. I'm drinking some juice. I had two glasses of whiskey. That's bullshit. And these bitches are. They keep pen. I don't understand it. Hold your little girl something. I take a credit to break that. That was was his rant. I'm not sure. We're going to go back to that. He's definitely high as fuck, dude. This stuff about children's telling him some fucking. Exactly. Crazy shit. I'm like, oh my God. I'm too fucked up. You fucked up. I told you we were going to get. Yeah, I knew that was the key. The key to make this podcast super special was. Well He. He asked for the whiskey himself, so he started the park. Yours or his? That's his. Oh, that's ours. No, that's ours. That's a gentlemen. Gentlemen, live listeners, this gentleman to record big time. Record record. Holy Shit. Gentleman. Jack is a. This is what they sent us. This right? It's good. I mean good and it all tastes terrible. It's like, you know, you're sucking on the devil's asshole.

Speaker 4:          02:01:47       I mean, that's kind of half the fun of Whiskey is that it's disgusting. It to taste good on instagram. I love this. A lot of people thought that this was a, a, a conspiracy because Eddie went live on instagram live and you disappeared. So there was a lot of talk online ever existed to bill Hicks. The globalist are anti human. They think we're a bunch of dumb animals, but where are the aliens? They're carrying on a shot. They believe it's not aliens. Does that have to do with the Luciferian freemasonry type shit? I'd love to. Bones, skull and bunk. Breakdown free because I know in the Albert Pike wrote the Freemason Bible. He's talking about Luciferian Shit. So if you're free, mason proceeding in my hand says he talks about he founded the KKK. Go for it. Go for it. Tell me about Albert Albert Pike. No, I want to give.

Speaker 4:          02:02:40       I mean, Joe, here's the thing. Joe, you, you brought in, right to your point about I willing to miss it. It'll lead to your point because the point you brought up, the whole issue, this first place, you brought up the whole point about no more weed. Alex, taking quotes from Buzz Aldrin tells you you went to, went to smoke. He take. What's the difference? I'm not trying to dominate to this guy. He was a nice. Seriously. I want to be nice. Great Guy. Look, I love you man. I'm happy to see you. But I'm telling you this is that the globalist admit a lot of this. It's in a lot of their white papers. All of the reports come in to actually give it to you. I will. They. They say they believe they're going to become gods. The rest of us are profane and shit about interdimensional beings.

Speaker 4:          02:03:27       Given them all the data. Let me tell you, you know where the theory of of the species, and we're all the Darwin stuff came from where he had an elucidation and believes he was given all this stuff from like demons and I'm not saying that's really confusing. Darwin Descartes. No, no, that's. Donald didn't take hard. Have it, isn't he the one that came up with the idea of science science from a dream. So Darwin's idea came from Darwin was like really into watch handling and stuff. Yes. Yes. And the guy said he acts like he does it. Okay. Whatever was the guy that. Yeah, a lot of those guys, they get the technology, they believe from a fricken other dementia, you know, people know all about this as much as I do or more joe. And you sit there and act like you don't know. I forgot you're afraid to give your audience all the information, but you're saying you're saying Joe Barnes, but I bring it up making it up to the center dimensional. But I just wanted to know where it's coming. Definitely the smartest guy showed it, showed it Darwin, you know, pulling it up. You probably already know that. I know that Darwin's partner, the God

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       that he developed a theory of evolution where they were, they both had like a similar theory and they came together with it and he was like really into it to the point where he was into channeling and all sorts of weird stuff that knows this discredited him. I listened to it on radio. That's what they believe. I'm not saying it's real. Shannon's going to have me up here. I'll clipped it out and that's what I'm saying. I'm saying they discredited him and they just put all the emphasis on Darwin. That's why you only hear about Darwin's forward. Okay. From Free Mason level, that's phase two. Let me tell you, give up the aliens. Come on. I know. You know things got to go back to you guys. What do we do? You've got to start there, which is fucking right. You don't have to do a show like this. It's great. I love it. I'm not mad. Let me just tell you. Please do.

Speaker 3:          02:05:20       If you look at this, that's what I'm telling you. I don't believe it. Okay. I'm telling you. She studied with the establishment, believes none of them are atheist. They all believe they're getting interdimensional stuff. She, if you go back to Dalton and Wedgewood and Huxley, recognize all, always moderate names. If you go back to Darwin, Darwin wrote this, these letters, republic. You can read these online from a national, you know royal archives in England and stuff. They all believed they were all part of a secret breeding program with a British thought. They would have like this super human if they bred these six families together to like create all this, just like mainland in British history. This is just known all eugenics history and then Golten who's related to all these other guys in the 18 fifties. He starts having these ideas and he says there's a double helix which the snakes for for science and medicine, and he said we're going to discover the keys and the building blocks of life, and he said it's going to be called biometrics and we'll track everybody by reading their genetics is what Hitler freaked out about and picked up and something like eight of the 14 new sciences like half or more than half the sciences that came since the 18 sixties were all from Dalton and all from Darwin.

Speaker 3:          02:06:32       So the media and the liberals give me this one thing, the origin of the species, like I'm not saying it's wrong or right. It's super heavy. Like galactic stuff. They give this to you. This is only one little boil down. BSN We'd have. You go to what these guys really wrote. They were like inter marrying and involved in wicked seances and channeling and, and, and, and all this weird ass crap. And then they envision, okay, there's a double helix DNA discovered it. Okay. Biometrics, okay. World government computers, okay. Atomic weapons give me the equations and they were like all them, like going to other scientists meetings and go, we believe there is a program where you take different matter together in isotopes and it'll cause an explosion and it's like they were like given either humans or super advanced already had this knowledge from somewhere else in our genetics and were here before and we're able to then manifest this through genetic memories and archives or it was given off world, but humans like have all this data compacted and compress ready like programs that called like the acacia records or something like that as though all of it is, is, is uh, Kaushik epic.

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       Here's the deal. Epigenetics. They'll take chickens with eggs and do 10 generations and major universities that have never seen a hot. And they put them in these, like these 20 foot ceilings and they'll have a triangle. Fly over in a square, fall over in a little baby. Chickens, neighborcare generation regeneration generation go on for 15 years. They fly one hawk over and they all squat, yelling, screaming, and run into their nest. Now they never saw hawk and never saw kill a chicken generation after generation whiskey. It was compressed data knowledge of the Hawk that is passed on genetically. Yeah. They say that's why children are always afraid of monsters that goes down the Tigers and bears. I used to be cat. My son just wants to be chased so much. He wants to practice getting away from a predator. He loves that Demos. He wants to get away.

Speaker 4:          02:08:21       You can't catch me and it'll just be ready to fight predators. You can't fight. If you can get the fuck away from that tiger at the Zoo and China, I recommend you do that. Yeah. My son's good stuff. Not even. You probably wouldn't be saying Alexander one cloth. You might not even get second. I'll. I'll admit that. I was like, Oh shit. We shouldn't have let them smoke weed, but then now you're thinking. Brought it back down. You came back. You came back here and keep it going. You're going in a good place right now. Keep it going.

Speaker 4:          02:08:54       You're talking about a. Now you're getting into Albert Pike. Ooh, well he's the founder of the KKK. Kept chomping confederate general head of the Illuminati worldwide at that time, so let's establish something that's like maybe people that are listening to this might go, what in the fuck are these guys ramble about? Well, I'm exposed to establish this throughout history from the beginning of organized human secret knowledge folks don't want to pass on as your own. There's also been people conspiring to control whatever. It's the sign. What end people conspiring to control whatever aspect of it, whether it's political, whether it's the military, like whatever it is. There's always been that. It's always happened, has been military coups. All throughout history. There's been wars all throughout and had a peaceful and bro. How so? I mean, dude, the intelligence community leaked all the data to break down the globalist. He Eddie's asking the intelligence community leaked all what data they looked all the way he likes.

Speaker 4:          02:09:48       He's over here saying, wait a minute. Are you saying that the Russians didn't do it? No. Really, how do you know this? Because the mainstream media says, hold on, hold on, Joe. Give me a break to. No, no, no. I just want to know how, you know, if you've ever, if you've known me for like 16, 17 years. Yes. Do you ever known me to say I have a source that I'm making it up? Be Honest. No, no, no. I mean I've got sources so you can't tell us how, you know. Let's just say I got data today from a head of state and what did he say? I can't tell you. Okay. Don't tell me the point is you didn't tell me. Yeah, but the frame is we screwed it up and released it early so it caused a problem. Explain the whole Russian diversion. We didn't mean on purpose. So I'm always mad at us. Bust out with that one thing because there's intelligent people like my students, like you hear that

Speaker 8:          02:10:34       you don't believe the Russians.

Speaker 3:          02:10:35       So where should it come from? How do they believe that? Yeah. Why are you saying that? The intelligence agency leaked all this and not Russia because I was told before it was all leaked by the former director of psychological operations, the CIA. I was going to come out. He told you that it was going to be leaked. Yeah. Before I was never like embed with the CIA. I've interviewed people from the CIA, NSA, defense, intelligence, you name it. Over the years. I mean it's all over the news, but it's entirely possible. General Flynn, former head of defense intelligence, tweets. All my articles. I'm not telling you it's some secret. I mean the enemy knows. The point is, is that I'm seen as an honest good person and understand what's going on. I'm out for humanity. I don't want personal power. I want to help people, but it isn't an entirely possible.

Speaker 3:          02:11:20       I mean like how, how does the information like that get out? Well, there's an open rebellion against the criminals have hijacked our government and so we overthrew the globalist and Obama and we're taking him over in France, in Italy, in Spain, in Greece, in the UK. The only place we're not successful so far is Canada. So you just took Australia about took Australia with the idea of free. I'm going to sign it. What does that mean? See, most people sit there and brag about stuff. I'm telling you what's really going on, what does it mean for Australia, I mean globalist or losing countries every month right now to the liberty movement. What? What says that these are people that want you and your family to be successful and aren't out to hurt you, to make you poor like the globalist. There's good people and they used the intelligence agencies to defeat the globalist and there's been a major counter offensive and the globals made one wrong move.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       It happened five years ago. It was. It was system wide leak. Four years ago. I've had CIA whistleblowers. All Obama show kernels and special operations, you name it, who were authorized by high level senators come on my show. They ran a counter coup. There was a deal made with radical Islam to actually take over Europe and then the United States and by that make us convert or not convert, but submit to Islam, not criticize it or they blow stuff up. They thought they bring in some new masculine arm that would make us submit and it got so bad that even our own intelligence agencies that had been corrupted said, this is too far. We're not doing it. And so America, about four years ago, sort of coming back up for air and now we're just overthrowing their whole system. There's a huge war going on. It's beautiful. We're kicking their ass on every front

Speaker 8:          02:13:00       now. Like I said, at the top, uh, it's a, it's a, it's the, at the dawn of a new age, you were against George W dot Bush, Clinton, Obama, all that. You are not a republican or a democrat. You weren't, you were against government. But now it's a new day. Now the conspiracy theorists like yourself, you're the king of them were pro government and the sheep. They're like out there protesting, crying, explain that.

Speaker 3:          02:13:28       Well, I mean, look, it's not. That trumps perfect. He really genuinely like going into all these corporate incentives. At one side of deals, there's no meetings. Now there's a lobbyist. He banned them all for lifetime. He literally goes in with actuaries and computer programs and ngos who were super NSA technology that even had before he was in and he says [inaudible] the generals came to him years ago. They said, we can deliver all this. Everybody, we don't want to make America poor. We don't want to have big wars. Who wanted to just have prosperity. Sarah, we've got next to free energy. All these technologies, cures for cancer. We're ready to release it. That's why I talked about the state of the union or his, uh, his first inaugural speech and there was a will be the second and he just really cares about humanity and he's not a satanist.

Speaker 3:          02:14:08       He doesn't like raping kids. He likes Super Hot Eastern European women and just, you know, you know, who wants that? He wants a little Kevin, you can have that just he's not out to get humanity. And he's got the intelligence agencies totally backing into the hill. Uh, and it's just a super epic moment to be alive. What's going on so far with trump from Iran? Hold on one second. So what do you think when you, you said earlier in the podcast, so you don't think he's perfect, right? What do you think he could do different that would make people accept him? Well, I said last week you should just about torture. He did the next day just magically alias. Because that again, that you came up with the idea and you listened to, what did you say? The tortures the Zeitgeists and I'm in the Zeit geist. So in that Zeitgeists guy, she just kind of see everything.

Speaker 3:          02:14:54       Even though you're just a normal person, you can like look into any avenue of any your your take on it is that it's good to have him in despite whatever flaws people may perceive me as well. He wants prosperity and he's not a part of the system that he replaced. That's why they're totally against. And he likes full grown women. Okay. I believe that you can only have to say that anymore now, but I'm just, I'm just telling you, most people, most people acted like to grab the kid out of your backyard and torture him for a couple of weeks so they kidnap, they torture. They raised kids thought that come combined. The emails and the emails are like, well, these are kind of exhausted. We're about to have to retire them, so you need to get in there. Some of these are damaged. Look him up.

Speaker 3:          02:15:39       He didn't believe me. No, I believed you. Look, I don't know what three year girls in a big old guy comes in. It just breaks their jaundice. So do you think trump's going after him least? What's going on? Oh yeah. Well, he's done. If he's successful, it's an entire route. Like a lot of people aren't just getting indicted right now. They're getting a good to take care of right now about the Vatican and they gonna are they weddings? How is that punch? Stop trump. He's the devil stopping anything. We've got stopping. That's the Vatican said. Yeah, the Vatican. Pedophiles central issue. Shitting their pants over trump. The Vatican is so bizarre. Imagine truncal and after the Vatican a country. What's crazy about it is he was, because I always wanted. This is what I ate, Alex. I always thought, how weird is it that everybody knows? South Park is making a goddamn episode about them

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       being pedophiles and get nobody's investigating what's going on here, so to me, and then you watch conspiracy of silence. That documentary that never got released about the whole network. Then you begin to realize, Oh shit. The reason my opinion is the reason no one's getting arrested at the Vatican at a high rate anyways is because everybody at the top is involved. Let me give you the good news. I'm not here to kiss the ass of the establishment. A lot of patriots in the government who have always criticized. It ended up being the people that heard me bitchy and you bitching do something. They'd done something and they're really trying to reverse this whole thing right now and there is a full out war inside the government of guys that like to eat steaks and drink beer and have women versus a bunch of pot bellied.

Speaker 2:          02:17:12       Pedophiles, Whoa, Jesus Christ. What's really fucked up is that the people that before the Sandusky thing came out that people rounded, probably heard rumors. That was probably someone who to talk. Someone that says something, but nobody really wanted to believe it. When it did happen. Well, in conspiracy of silence is a documentary you can watch it never got released. They're talking about the base, the headquarters of the pedophile network. It's an international network, is an Omaha, Nebraska at boy's town. They like taking orphans, orphans. There's different levels. There's guys that we didn't want any trouble. They just want to sleep and then there's cycles. They want to go kidnap. There's like the hard core people and you know what? At top officials and in every aspect of government and celebrity, it's not everybody, but it's enough, so there's enough people involved that nobody's investigating anybody because they're all involved.

Speaker 2:          02:18:14       They all better keep their mouths shut so crazy that something gets to the level of the Catholic church. Got To with it. Yeah. No. I want to hear about a conversation with myself and Donald Trump. Yes, sure. Go for it. Allowed to do this. Wait a minute. Before you do it, just let him. Who cares me drunk and high on marijuana. That was this, this, this. Go. No. Trump basically said we're going to clean it up, Alex. we know all about it and Alex, we're going to stop them and we're going to do it. But he also said Obama's from Kenya. Well, that was when. That's a huge intelligence op. You want to write that down. You will know about Reagan and was talking about birth certificate. Now can tell you the full scoop on that. What do you think happened there? I know exactly what they told him that Obama was from Kenya. They fucked with them. They don't hear here right now? Yes. Okay. I was going to tell a trump story, but. Okay. I'll do that. Good. We'll go back to the trump story sharing and we're good. We're good. Thank you. Eddie. Eddie, Bravo. Jamie. You better add extra juice to that time. Joe. Hold on. Apple juice. Apple juice. Maybe not. Alex, come on. Okay. One secret is Christ. If you give me

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       minutes, I'm going to fuck another dimension. How many years? Seven years. So we're just about to say what was the. What was the issue? Jesus Christ. Do you remember what the question wants? Jamie? What Donald Trump told you now that wasn't it. Yeah. No, you were about to say what Donald Trump told you, but he knows that about. You want to know about something else? What the fuck is it about? But let's leave. Fuck, but hold on a second. We've on fucking with my memory. What was it? You were just. You were just talking about. I'm not the only one. I used to have a good memory. I don't remember. Oh, we're too high. Let's go. The trump's dot. I don't do anything with trump. Trump. Jamie's going to figure it out. Jamie's going to figure it out. What is it that one will tell me? Just a second. Someone's going to tell him on twitter and we'll figure this out. Jesus Christ, and then I'll write this up. Problem with being too high and talking over each other. He's about to tell you go trump calls times a week on average 10 hours show. No, no, no. They should be your longest podcast. We will definitely peter out before then. No, no, no. It go forever. What is no one knows what the fuck we were just talking about a minute gap.

Speaker 1:          02:20:34       We all forget. Really? Good question because we're blasted you better. You better call your dispensary and get some answers. So you were talking about the Vatican. We were talking about pedophiles in the Catholic church certificate. Oh, that's right. Okay. So tell me what. It's just a place where I'm not ashamed of this because I got conned. Went up what I've been calling, which happens, you know, every, every once in a while I admitted later. We learned from it. Okay. What happened, dude? Come on. I only told you it's funny, but Kenya, Kenya, Kenya. Okay. And everything. I'm going to say your listeners can write this down. They can search engine everything I'm going to say and learned she does for themselves because the journey with info wars is. It's not that I'm that smart. I'm just like you. I'm having this journey and I'm going to show you.

Speaker 1:          02:21:25       So this is what happened when Obama's running for office and Hillary's people, because I follow the news everyday. Hillary's campaign, this letter came out, puts out these born in Kenya and I'm like, yeah, screw her. I was quietly, and I'm really ashamed of this, but I told us there's this. I'll just say it. I was, I was an early on Obama supporter in that I wanted to try to unify people. I didn't like John Mccain, so I said, yeah, he's bad. The Democrats are bad. But I hated what had happened. So much food by Obama to. Well, I was hopeful. Let's get let him talk. I mean, it wasn't an Obama supporter. I just didn't attack him. And you liked it better than the alternative? Yeah, I didn't push him for office. I was just like, hoping that all this bs was real show. And then I started hearing these leaks and it was from Hillary. You can google the city. Hillary first pro generated the whole the whole deal show. I'm sitting there hearing debt, debt. He's born in Kenya, I think. I don't care. That's a bunch of bs. And then the articles started coming out as the right wing picture that who does the and

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       it's his wife and my 2006 and seven in speeches going. My husband born in Kenya, knows about the immigrant experience. It's video. You can pull up Michelle Obama. Oh yeah. Pull it up. And then. And then Harvard law review, which he headed up for at least three years. He was the editor and he says, I was born in Kenya. A little bitty bar by buys picture. Oh yeah. Says he's working, but he wasn't wearing Kenyan. Wait, plug. Get through this. Oh. So that was just like pizza gate is. I finally learned how to double cross. Well, it's, it's not, not in pedophilia. Hold on, let's hear. Say here you go.

Speaker 9:          02:22:59       Let's be testing, which is still plaguing so many of our communities, uh, which you all know a lot of that is due to homophobia. But Barack has led by example when we took our trip to Africa and visited his home country in Kenya, uh, we'd soak up public HIV test for the very point of showing folks in Canada.

Speaker 3:          02:23:21       Okay. But that doesn't mean that he was listening to the club, he just found that fast. But there's another where she said, and there's the Harvard law review when she edited, where he says, I was born in Kenya. Okay, well that shit up right there. Or was she saying is his homeland? Like if you're from Ireland, like I didn't want to go back to Italy or Ireland or totally land. They call it the homeland. But listen, let's just going onto what are we covering? Kenya trump certificate. So yeah, trump got involved in all that. An old bursar. We'll go ahead. No, no. So how did, what did someone leak that information to him to try to make him look foolish? Because he chased after it. Yes. So we're just researching. It's anybody from anybody. Foolish. So do you think they just maybe made an incorrect judge that we found out all about it.

Speaker 3:          02:24:05       This is stunning information show people want to say he's illegitimate. They then look at him in the Harvard law review saying he's in Kenya, we look at clubs, they look at the fact that he won't release his birth certificate. He had a name, name Barry Satara and Indonesia. He had all these weird cut out names. All he had like five alias. Wow. Why did he wrote that? He wrote dream look it up because he wrote dreams of my real father or dreams of my father. My real father is the documentary and in and he talks about Frank Marshall Davis, the communist famous pornographer that he spit summers with. He looked side by sides, the same guy, so they were worried that it was gonna be Frank Marshall Davis, but it had actually been his mom in like a scam making money off. She was CIA bringing back people in the US and sham marriage is to have them integrate. It was basically a cover up. The fact that his real father was frank, Marshall Davis, the Communist, and so that's who Obama's real dad was and dreams. My real father breaks it all down. It's online and it's pretty powerful info. So what does that mean? It just is a perfect example of you're not born in Kenya, you're really born in Hawaii on the main city based island. Honolulu to Frank Marshall Davis.

Speaker 4:          02:25:25       And your grandfather, CIA, your mother's CIA. That's all been declassified here. This cutout puts mom was a CIA. Oh yeah. What was she. What did she do for the CIA? She was a sex operator. Yeah. And, and, and she posed for news photos and kind of Betty Page style was sex operatives in photos at Frank Marshall Davis, his house. And you know this because you've seen these. I've interviewed the people

Speaker 8:          02:25:50       will involved. I've read dreams of my father where he admits I stayed at Frank Marshall Davis, his house. He was like my dad. My grandfather had a special unspoken relationship with them. Quotes. Look up Obama, frank, Marshall, Davis or Obama's father. What do you think about the conspiracy theory that the Obama was bred by the CIA the whole way through all the truths on a third. Oh really? When you say see I, that just means like

Speaker 4:          02:26:16       a marketing project. If whoever was in power at the time for eight years, whoever's in charge of that, whoever shows interest can go in and then just basically be involved in controlling the levers of the social engineering of the society.

Speaker 8:          02:26:32       So what does that have to do with Obama growing up? Did were those rumors that he was in a CIA agent and Pakistan while he was supposed to be in Columbia?

Speaker 4:          02:26:42       Probably. Exactly. He probably spent six months. Yeah. There's the supposed father Barack versus the second versus frame marshal dose. I think you look more like the other. Barack. Okay. Well look up, look up, look up frank. Marshall Davis is pornography and it's mine and I will do no such than Obama's mother. Clearly in the photos. And here's his book. Dreams of my father admitting that he stayed with Frank Marshall Davis. Okay. But, but listen, that's not the issue. So the, we would, I asked you though to get back to where we started from was why did trump chase after that whole. He was born in Kenya. Shit for so long because he knew it was super hot with the public and he wanted to know the answer to it as well. And didn't like the things Obama was doing. Hmm. It was a weird thing, right? Because, uh, if you were a guy who was a white guy and we wanted to prove that you're born in Austria,

Speaker 4:          02:27:41       but you had some birth certificate that said you were born in the United States, he spoke perfect English but yet a square jaw and you look like you're from the frozen north. Like this motherfucker is freeze from Austria. Dude, I'm telling you, these from fucking Austria. And then someone like made a big deal out of it gave you like a fake birth certificate and people wouldn't do. You'd never hear racism then. Interesting. Like you would hear that. Yeah, this guy might have been born in another country but it wouldn't be president. So yeah, it's a race. I mean, instantaneously it gets connected to racism. There's an assumed racism with almost any there. What color? Barack Obama. When he accusation you have any Henry Su's music. I'm here. What color he is along the watchtower is the best ever. That's pretty God damn good

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       song. Yeah. All of that show. All I'm telling you is you researched frank, Marshall, Davis and Obama, I believe it is. It's cracking and believe how inclusive it is. My Mom and dad are we talking about like five years ago. They thought, that's crazy. Let us see the film about it. They saw it. They were blown away, but listen, let me give you the big picture please. The elite admit that they are studying humanity like they're a breakaway civilization. They believe they're taking the best ideas of humanity and building a breakaway civilization of technocracy show they can transcend us and I want the public to know the decision has been made dumb you down balkanize you turn you against yourselves, have regional wars, play people off against each other and then basically released bioweapons that wipe out most of the population, all the Atlantic transcendent.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       Pause. This right here. Who are the elite like when you say the elite, who are these people and how do they get together her? Hold on a second. How do they all agree? Who Votes? How do they decide is a bunch of towels? Let me type a super billionaire characters like run and shit. So how do they get together and all agree on the data side, on agendas that will empower their individual agendas and they're pretty much let into those power structures early on side of the men. They are a group that was the Bilderberg Group Club of Rome. Bilderberg group. It's the club of Rome Davis. A club of Rome is a population reduction group. I mean, if you can go to infowars.com right now there's an article and a video I cut about Oprah Winfrey. I'm not saying it's a bad person or she's part of a secret eugenics group. Hold on a second. Stop right there. Only for opposite. I'm not saying she's a bad person, but he's part of a secret eugenics group.

Speaker 1:          02:29:59       I'm a really good progressive. I like killing weak people. I'm just trying to thin the herd. I'm a really good person though. Yeah, that's hilarious. Just absolutely. So you can go there. It's the truth about Oprah Winfrey. Okay. And. And it just deals with it in the news. Oprah Winfrey and secret meeting face. He looks so serious. I was like, I toilet. You think she's in secret meetings with like the Bilderberg group or something? She admits that to repo. They admit on the news to reduce population because we linked at first, but let's play it know when someone might hold please. When someone like her says something about reducing the amount of illegitimate babies born or the amount of babies that are born because there's no birth control. A lot of times those kind of statements get construed into population control. She's in the car and beat and people start saying she's into population control and that means she wants in the secret meetings and she's pushing in and she's tax exempt.

Speaker 1:          02:30:54       I'm not in those secret meetings. Are you in those secret meetings? You go to the failings that we like to. Have you ever been in one of those secret meetings? I did check into one. Do you hear what they said? Yes. Did they say they want to kill half the people know what they say. That was really shocking to Bohemian Grove. It wasn't. I remember that dude. That was the. That was the real shit. Fucking Jim Brown type shit dude. I mean that is like if you want to go back to like conspiracy theory, fuel like that, get excited about

Speaker 7:          02:31:19       something when you find out that there really are a bunch of global elites to get on this ranch and they got a fucking giant stone owl and they burn a, a bundle of wood in effigy and they all were fucking masks and Shit and then you actually have video footage of it and there's weird sort of a ceremony they're doing and whether or not they're pretending you're pretending it is, whatever, whatever it is, it's crazier and I was there and they have exactly what it is. Yeah, go into that. How did you sneak into the Bohemian Grove? That was amazing. Well, people always said it was a Saturday, let me. And it wasn't quite like that, but we had an insider wanted to get me in to actually see it and most people aren't bad that go to it. But the point is, it's kind of a gateway into all of this. It's amazing. So this is you at Bohemian Grove and you're in, you're on the other side of liquor. It looks like a little pond or something. Feel free to play it. It goes beyond old care. May fire make merriment with your dust where you go, no care. It was so strange. It was so bizarre. Listening to that guy and the speaker blaring out across the cronkite play it put lit. Let's. Let's play of that was Walter cronkite.

Speaker 10:         02:32:30       Oh,

Speaker 7:          02:32:36       sounds like a play for high school. It is. It's all play,

Speaker 7:          02:32:40       but religion started that way as as, as entertainment. So what do you think? This is just some really ancient ritual that they're redoing. Yeah. I thought it was no big deal till I was in the crown of old men that were lavishing. They were like, they loved it. I certainly had jackie lighting and their pants. Are you sure? Are you projecting? No, no. They were like to see. What is it about people that love those secret societies? Like you remember that jfk speech about secret societies who will not tolerate them. Yeah. It's a fucking beautiful speech. Well, because I'll pull it up, Jimmy, pull up jfk speech about what power over others that don't crave secret essence, right? They're looking for that secret place. The most high. Yeah, no, absolutely. That's, but that's just like you were talking about pedophiles, just like you know, any other deviant. Fuck yeah. I just want to go eat a big pile of steaks and drink some beer. I say, let's crank this up.

Speaker 11:         02:33:37       Ladies and gentlemen. The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths

Speaker 7:          02:33:53       and a secret proceeding. I'm by myself, but case please don't put this on. I don't know if you've ever heard this excessive and I'm just talking about secret societies

Speaker 11:         02:34:01       of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it even today. There is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it and there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it's in my control and no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent. They knew it to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public, the facts they deserve to know, but we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on severity instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.

Speaker 11:         02:35:34       It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic intelligence, economic science comments, political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. It's mistakes have buried, not headlined, its dissenters. A silenced not praised. No expenditure is questioned. No rumor is printed. No secret is revealed. No president should face public scrutiny of his program. For from that scrutiny comes understanding and from that understanding comes support or opposition and both unnecessary. I'm not asking your newspapers to support an administration, but I am asking your help approach and the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people for I have complete confidence

Speaker 7:          02:36:38       kilter. That's a. that's such a crazy speech because it's him talking about the structures that were already in place and about the dangers of withholding information for people and him being forthright as a president in a way that we've never heard before since like he's literally talking, Jill trump, trump, trump, spending like that. Now, what a trump tell you. Well, we. Let's just be clear. He's talking about our own military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned about. His outgoing predecessor. He's talking about the Soviets there. At the same time, he was a really smart cookie. The Eisenhower warning is one of the creepiest things in human history. Really? Military, industrial

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       complex. Okay. That sounded like he was talking about communism. Yeah. Pull up our warns of the Military Industrial Complex. He did it, but just go. There's a clip that just has that segment of it will be so yeah, there was a lot. He says there is a scientific technocratic elite that has had the control of all information about to shut it down to the public and then they will control the military, so beware of the military. He was in the military. It was bad. He said these 10 military industrial eugenicist. We're about to get control of it. The scientific people are telling you about. See if you can find where it goes. It Jamie, this is the address right here is

Speaker 6:          02:37:53       we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed for major war among great naked

Speaker 2:          02:38:06       chose ride type in eisenhower military industrial complex speech. Yeah, he's going to say it in here somewhere, but it's a three minute speech at CCV, Alex. it seems like trump, you know everybody, a lot of smart people in different points of their life, they begin to realize how much, how many lives they've been told. They begin to wake up. They're not totally woke up, but they begin to wake up and then they find out about nine slash 11, but that don't believe all this other shit and then they find out about this, but they don't believe in all that other shit. Then they find out about that and then at the very high level it's like the dudes, they're like, yeah, all this shit is true. If you could follow the money, it's probably true. You might be wrong one or two or three times, but generally we're dealing with a totally crooked situation. That's what are they doing? They're not stealing money from corporations. You steal money from a corporation. They're going to come after you and kill you. Uh, with what they're doing is the mastery of stealing tax money. That's what this is all about is just stealing tax because nobody, because nobody's going to go after tax money. You get all these programs and these bills pass. Let's play this good Jamie. These military contracts, the tax payers are paying for all this.

Speaker 6:          02:39:21       Their livelihood are all involved. So is the very structure of our society in the councils of government. I'm going to guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination in danger, our liberties or democratic processes,

Speaker 2:          02:39:52       Jesus Christ. Just let that out like it was so tight because you think about this back in the early days of radio, in the early days of moving pictures only finish. Only the elite had access to this technology. Moving pictures radio right from the get go, right day one

Speaker 1:          02:40:15       right from day one. It wasn't like your average guy was trying to help humanity. The guys who had this technology, we're like, damn. They believe whatever the fuck we say back in the day, you'd listen to the radio, those news reports or when the movie pictures were from madness. Yes, that's what I'm talking about right from the get go TV, movies, radio. All of it was propaganda. It never left. Alex Jones is aliens involved in this story. Please talk about propaganda and movies and Howard had ll limits. Sir, come to him. Who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs? All linen answers that is now just google operation northwoods. Oh, I know about that. Sure. So they came to them and they said, we're going to launch terror attacks in America and start a war with the Soviet. She's like, well, I know they're evil, but we're not gonna do that.

Speaker 1:          02:41:02       So he fired him. The JFK comes here. The same guys had to make him do it. He refuses. So they kill him. Well, they wanted to have a drone jetliners and blow them up and blame it on the Cubans. Nine slash 11. They wanted to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay. They had a bunch of really crazy shit planned. When you realize what our operation northwoods was and you realized that this was signed by the joint chiefs of staff, it scares the shit out of you. Is this real? What? We're all talking here. We're talking here. Does it? Doesn't that scare the shit out of you? Doesn't blow your mind that still today it's 2017. Doesn't it blow your mind that people still think that nine slash 11 happened the way it was we'll get to in northridge is 100 percent crazy back to the city classified 2000.

Speaker 1:          02:41:53       Well, when people realize that that was a real documents, the US government plan to start war with Russia and kill people and blow up movie theaters, attack US military basis, kill American civilians, capital, kill American military food. People hijack jets, crashing them. Have she, I ain't get on board. So fake plane lands are the real plane lands. A fake plane of tags was nine slash 11. It's just bananas that someone would actually sit down and write by patriots six months before nine slash 11 trying to stop it. Really? And that's not saying Islamic terrorism real. It's not saying bullshit. Even did it. Some super dark state group, which Congress now has the 28 pages vindicating 9:11 druker's that Shoddy Arabia with people that they had gotten to convert to Islam had paid off of their trillions and trillions had joined them in some larger plan to blame, uh, Iraq and other countries that were non radical.

Speaker 1:          02:42:42       So Saudi Arabia, you could take them over who, who put together nine slash 11 shawnee Rabia of the Muslims either with anybody. So they want to invade these other countries. The adder to happen in the US. I mean the US wasn't involved. Of course. What? What are you saying? Who was involved? Who were the key players that nine slash 11. It's. It's totally compartmentalized. So you run a drill of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon being attacked on that day. So the planes are flying around. Oh this is just a. That was a drill that was supposed to be run that day. It all

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       came out a drill that was about it. A false false flags. I. It seems like, okay, we're going to do a false flag. We need to set up a drill. They need a drill going on. It's 99 point nine percent of the government wasn't involved because of computers. It was a test. They get a 100 times worse now no one will know because it's all remote. Activated the jets by then. We're all remote control. Every jet for 25 years. The big new ones has control morobe control. It's all. It's all. It's crazy, man. There's jets now are unmanned. Absolutely. Well, no, there man. It's just thinking to go on autopilot. Stupid. Damn man. If you think about it, it's remote controlled dumb thing they said about the drone jetliners and they were going to blow up that jetliner and blame it on the Cubans. That wasn't going to be a jetliner filled with people.

Speaker 2:          02:44:01       It's going to be a drone. So they have the capability. In 1962 of doing that, which is how did, how did, how did Robert F Kennedy or JFK, his older brother who was Joe Kennedy Junior die. He was flying a fighter plane, remote controlling to be 17. Bloated with explosives as drones to crash into Germany. They had drums in World War II. Jesus Christ. They had drones in World War II. What would they powered by Google cave and how did Joe Kennedy Junior die? He does secret mission over Germany. My father. No, Joe Kennedy Junior. Oh. The crazy thing about the Kennedy's is, is you know, if you're. A lot of times you see criminals come from like a good family and then you can see Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy. They come from gangs to his dad is a gangster, straight up mafia, and then he has two kids. They thought they had him under control because he's from a Mafia family.

Speaker 2:          02:45:00       Here's the. Here's the guy's named Joe Kennedy. Isn't that weird? Because it's like you're the opposite of your parents, like you want to go against your parents. So Robert Kennedy and John F Kennedy, they went against that shit that that's the only reason they were in there because of the mob. The mob supported Bob Stole Illinois for and the mom supported John F Kennedy. He was hanging out with Frank Sinatra. Then all of a sudden he flipped and you know what? He stopped hanging out with Frank Sinatra. He started changing his ways. Something flipped. Did the did. Did he have a kid that died or something like that? Is that something made him flip? I thought I read something that could be total bullshit, but it could be that he had a son that died and made them flip. Go to Joe Kennedy Jr. Here. He was. Killed. The guys that could make you think totally different when you're. WHen you're a kid dies, you're like, fuck this. I'm going with my soul. Right? You're like, fuck this. What could be worse? Woke up. My son already died. I'm coming after you. I'm coming after you liKe a fucking apache

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       savage with nothing to lose. So Joe Kennedy jr was killed in action while serving as a land base patrol bomber pilot in world war ii and with posthumously awarded the navy cross, Alex Jones throwing down. Alex jusT doesn't doubt dude. You're fucking. You're on fire. This was almost three hours of. There's people out there. There's nothing. Don't just laying it down. You're laying it down like game of motherfucking thrones. Yes you are. All I know is there's people in the government that want to empower people and they're trying to do a good job and I'm not anti government. I want to have a good constitutional government. And the truth is, I couldn't believe when in my pd contacted me of the secret service. The secret service came to me when I was at the rnc. So I'd like to number one passage. Nobody had read passages. I'd go behind the scenes.

Speaker 3:          02:47:01       Nobody stopped me, but back in the back deal, the secret service, like in their ships, go, hey alex, come here will tell you something about hillary. Give us a contact number. The next month we're going to contact you. About a month later I get a contract. They go, can you come to it? There's nothing digital. He'd come down and meet at this place. So I go down and meet, meet one of other people as well. Because where they were, it was like they were hitting. Both sides were operation and they said to me, hillary has seizures. Like every 30 minutes she's got an ambulance, is black. She falls down all the time, just heavier people at her event. He'll see her falling down. She's covering it up. Well sure enough, a month, an outside on air. A month later she falls down in front of the cameras. We had footage wait before in cleveland again, st louis, she was back to, oh, it was a key battleground and she.

Speaker 3:          02:47:49       She was like for an hour in this emergency tent with, with ambulances and stretchers, so I'm telling you, I mean I've got real sources that really care about what's happening in this country and everything. They told me it Was dead on. You know, what's scary about my government lakes. Let's go. Go back to the hillary thing was very bizarre because nobody was supposed to mention it like you weren't supposed to mention that she was fallen down. Said, we're like monya. They said, oh, she had pneumonia. Let me tell you something. I've had pneumonia. You know what I haven't done. I haven't ever walked and just fallen down while I'm walking. Really frayed as the background and then comment on it because this is key. It's known that in 2012 when she fell on her head and she's got a severe concussion that was worrying for my sources, but yeah, she's in the hospital for a year.

Speaker 3:          02:48:35       Then she was. Yeah, she was fucked up for six whole months according to clinton to bill, so she looks like hell, we don't know where she is. And then meanwhile I'm told, hey, she's falling down all the time. She looks like hell on tv. And then secret service says, look, you've got the people, get up off your ass and follow her. So we follow her in like five cities. We didn't catch it. We were in New York. they sneak her out. She falls down having epilepsy every 15, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. The poInt is is my intel was good. They gave us good info. So what are the elite thinking? They're going to put somebody in

Speaker 1:          02:49:07       with epilepsy. That's all I'm saying. But do you think that it was just the idea was she can hold it together. Just anything rather than get as soon as they. If they just want her to get her through, get all those girls like oh my god, everything is great. And then they pass all these motherfucking bills, and it was, it seemed to me that when all this was happening that people so desperately wanted to not look at it because the alternative was trump. It wasn't that they were taking an objective look at it and go, wow, maybe she shouldn't be blacking out. And then you consideR that massive head injury that she had in 2012, which is real. It's a fact. You don't like it when you bring that up though, because they think if you bring that up, you're going to change people's opinion and you're going to help trump win.

Speaker 1:          02:49:47       Can I just spend two minutes talking to your audience? Which, which camera is about trump. That one, just auto claim to have all the answers and I'm not here to boost Your trump because I'm tied to his wagon. If I attack trump, I'd make more money. This isn't about money. It's about the truth. Trump really is trying to cut taxes and make people successful and wealthy. He really does care about the average person. The elite have set up a plan to slave people to make folks poor. And all I'm asking you to do is get past thinking that you're part of the establishment or you're smart because you're anti trump. I'm asking you to actually look at what's really been going on and understand that democrats, republicans come and go. Some are good, some are bad. The whole power structure has been against trump for a very serious reason.

Speaker 1:          02:50:32       Trump is coming after them and really is attempting to bring down this whole global system. And that's where all hell's breaking loose. So I just want your viewers and listeners know I'm not some political hack. Like you said earlier, I used to be against bush. I Wish obama would have been real. the point is they got to obama with trump. He doesn't give a damn. They admit they're offering money. Everything. He doesn't listen. So you think what trump could or excuse me, what obama could have been his who he was when he was running for office, that he was this radical element of change, hope and change. He wanted to close down guantanamo bay. He's wanting to do all these things. But one of the posters in the back, during his administration, the dea decided to not take marijuana off the schedule. One, everybody knows it's not scheduled yet.

Speaker 1:          02:51:17       Was the cover for schedule one means no medical use. He's start looking at the time it means that's what it means to be schedule one. It's crazy that marijuana is schedule one when it's the most useful out of all the different, various illegal smart you are joe. You smoke marijuana quite a bit and you're still smart guys. Definitely not bad for just smelling it and I can't even think here. I know you can't listen. Let's get serious. I'm telling you, it's trump about what are those conversations about? Let the people knoW. I mean trump really wants to make poor people rich. He really wants you to feed collectivism. Collectivism. He hates all the bashing the family and what's collected. All the new world order. Collectivism is this thing. And like you're not an individual. You're like part of a group. And truMp can't stand that. He can't stand. Seeing as a businessman, business

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       deals where China has like 35 percent currency tariffs on us. There's no way he could even compete and they're shutting off our power plants with regulations but not theirs. Why do we do that then? What is the reason why? Because our elites under, at, quite frankly, under, under, under kissinger and, and, and, and of course, uh, uh, you know, the president who was in that administration, nixon, dave made a one sided deal for a leech to go make deals with China and their billion plus slaves. I'll say that condescendingly, they're like slaves to leverage out the west, the whole world's industry and trump doesn't like those ones side of deals. And he's saying, listen, we're not going to impoverish America, we're going to empower America and we're going to actually use american power to promote freedom worldwide. So let me get this straight for guys like me that, I mean, all trump's does little promises.

Speaker 2:          02:52:56       So what you're saying is, in layman's terms, the elite, the people in power, the people that had the green light power to sign these treaties, they were maybe offered a couple meal here, couple meal there, and sign this to sell the country out so that they could make $10,000,005 billion thing like that is something that you asked, got colonized by corporate takeover artists and trump at the end said f you. So we're goIng to take their whole global system. They built for nothing. Take it away from them and have the true new american millennium, not the new century. You listened to his. I don't know if we got the time. If you want to play this 18 minute share to the union, we could start or not. Definitely not going to play that. Fidel, his, his, his, his global, uh, inauguration speech. He lays the whole beautiful bitch out.

Speaker 2:          02:53:48       And so if anybody ever wanted to actually have somebody trying to make them great and wealthy and powerful, it's donald j. Trump. That's why the whole eat the whole power structure, hollywood, all the pedophiles, every damn demon, every pot belly, one inch fucker, you know they are all against trump because he is pro human and he wants to dominate all these people. It is an active alpha male. He wants. It's of the ego every now and then. Every now and then we can help them run for office. It. He talks to you and he calls you are right. I mean, that's crazy. He uses the other people. You know, people think, I don't know Alex Jones. They believe the mainstream media. When they tried to crucify him and say he's at butler quack, and he said, well, alex, what you need? Honestly, if someone had temporary you, you, you, you need me right next to you All the time to balance powerful. This is you being right there that you're like the fucking need to calm them down on your lap. You got a bio suit on and you got to fucking ray gun. You're like, okay, we need this alien to for to benefit humanity, but I got to put this goddamn bio suit on because he's going crazy. Just gotta kinda steer them

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       occasionally. Just you get out, you get on rants and you'll see you'll connect four or five different non-related subjects, but that's, that's. It's beautiful. It's not a bad guy that does. Does that just go rent after rent, after rent, after rent with no teleprompters. Only a guy that could do is right. I'm actually very pleased that, that joe has finished all my sentences and knows more than I do and it sits over there acting like he doesn't know all this. I no, no more than you can make them more than you know, just as much as every document, every secret program. He knew all about it, you know, it waSn't bullshitting the whole time. You've been fucking. You are building. Listen mike, hold on. Cigarette about bill hicks.

Speaker 8:          02:55:47       He's a great comic. Micro scopic, bacterial penis atomic split. The goddamn critical mass compared to Joe rogan. I'm nothing. I'm nothing and I've talKed so much shit about conspiracy theories that I feel like I need to shut the fuck up because I don't. I don't want any trouble asking questions of the universe. It's questioning on your own, the mystery and not Just receiving the priest class stuff. Yes. I'm not trying to. I walked away from my podcast. Nobody. I thought nobody was listening, but now people want me to go back. I'm like, I thought nobody, but listen. I don't want to be a conspiracy guy like you. I don't want to be that, but I listened to you and you are my canary in the goddamn coma. As long as you're alive, I feel like I'm okay to say shit, but I'll tell you this.

Speaker 8:          02:56:40       Every time I come to do the fight companion, gi joe rogan experience, I swear to god. I tell myself this, this fight companion, no motherfucking conspiracy stairs. let's just live live. I called joke and I and I called him after a fight companions. They go, I can't believe I did it again, joe. I can't believe, but suddenly something in me wants to help people. For some reason and a lot of times my enemies like, fuck them, make a fucking, you know what I mean? Fuck them. And I'm like, damn, if I just walk away because I'm compelled, but I'm not trying to make money off conspiracy theories. I gave have a conspiracy theory podcasts right now and it would be okay, but I'm not even trying to do that. I don't want to do that. I don't want to be that guy. Don't want to be you, but something inside me when the fucking mic stand in someone's question and I'm like, I got a son and I want to make sure did I fucking do everything I can for him because I don't want him. I don't want to leave him with some shit that I couldn't change. So inside of me, I'm like on the fence all the time.

Speaker 4:          02:57:49       Therefore, when you're overzealous, overzealous and you actually turn people the wrong way and they look at any conspiracies is being proposed or even the ones that are real like sand dusky liked the catholic church like many other ones before.

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       There's a ton of them. Liked hastert. Who was the speaker of the fucking house? Pedophile. There's been a lot of frank, so it's really critical, but hold on a second. Hold on a second, eddie. It's really critical Whenever you discussing any of these things and you get all the fucking ducks in order before you pick a side, it's super important because anytime you make some crazy claim and it's connected to a conspiracy theory and it proves to be Wrong, it fucks with all the ones that are not personally. I'm all rIght. People saying I'm bill hicks. People show the others saying that. It's like their eye hurts me. They're that dumb that they don't know my own personality. It's a joke. It's a joke. Me, man, it's on reddit. Shit. No, I get it. I get it. It's unfortunate they're having fun, but let's get to know. Some of them are serious. No. Yeah, but no.

Speaker 8:          02:58:50       Let me ask you something really quickly is very important. Let me ask you a super important. I feel like I was, I was trying to say this earlier, but we had to go back and finish up mouth, but this is very important. I, uh, I teach jujitsu. I got students all over the world. I got schools all over the world. Um, I have all my students. I'm a west star tool to wake up, you know, that's like a metaphor. I'm a conspiracy theory, like at different times. Some are just into me for jujitsu, but they believed the cNn site 100 percent, it takes him three years and they're like, oh shit. They started smoking weed and damn there all, all over the conspiracy faCt, everybody awakens at a different point. No matter how smart they are, you cAn, you can get your master's, your phd, you could be, oh, I'm a scientist or whatever, but you're working for the government and you ain't thinking about you. But listen, listen. Do you think donald, do you think Donald Trump is in the middle of an awakening, awakening from a hundred percent real? He's like, is he in the middle of an awakening? Yes, because he could easily have been a billionaire tumor two years ago who, who bought all the mainstream shit, but he was a billionaire. He didn't give a fuck about the mainstream shit. He's cutting deals blowing up, but now you know at a certain point, no matter where you are, no matter how smart you are, you awaken a little, little by little trump.

Speaker 1:          03:00:09       Donald trump knows which way the wind's going, and as julius caesar in, in, in the famous play by william shakespeare of julius caesar, there is a tide in the affairs of malmo taken at the flood, leads onto fortune, or as mark twain said, in the beginning of patriots have scarce man hated and feared scorn, but a time when has caused exceeds it costs. Nothing has Joined a patriot. so here's what's happening right now. There's a major shift happening and trump really wants to empower the people. Globalism is anti human, and so all I'm trying to get at is, is that some really big things are happening in this world and people watching shouldn't be conservative or liberal. CAn you stop? Can I stop you for a moment? What do you. When you say globalism, what do you mean by that? Please define that. Globalism is like neo colonialism, but it's colonialism over humans, individuals, government states, old world, new world. It's worldwide. Colonialism, rothchild, but financially it's monopoly is the dominant populations and create centralized systems of monopolies in controlling wants to innovation. It wants to end up where mobility, globalism is. Corporate world government. Why do they want to stop innovation?

Speaker 1:          03:01:27       Because they see it as a bourbon. They see it as what they call it, disruptive technology and humanity. So powerful. You've already got a monopoly. So is this a recent consideration after the unit? It's been. Internet has been in global is bigger than that, but yes we are. Part of that's true. Since they've already got control, they want competition to end. They're in control. They don't want challengers. They've seized control of the human psyche, human development to the stars. They've got it all. I think they're getting rid of humanity and becoming gods. Whatever dimension they're tuned into, told them that. So they want debates to end and they want authoritarianism. They want to see what would happen there. Bolt, how is Donald Trump going to stop this? A bulk came off the, uh, going crazy. Cns making bolts come up and hoping it happens. Alex, how are you hoping they have to do with blocking?

Speaker 1:          03:02:15       Chances are energy siphons there vampiric actions of course, so if he actually cuts taxes to poor people and middle class and gets rid of tax incentives for really rich, he's not coming after the rich, but from a conservative perspective that republicans are cheering and so is that what he wants to do? He wants to cut taxes for everybody except the rich. He's gonna. Encourage them. Really? Oh yeah. That seems like the opposite of what a rich guy would do. Right, but he understands like Henry Ford did, you got to sell a car where people can afford to buy it. You got to pay your employees where they can buy it. He wants real prosperity. He doesn't. This is trying to get off in his. In his limousine. Robin by burnout old towns. Does is has been announced this tax plan. Yeah. So jamie, see if he could pull up what it says.

Speaker 1:          03:02:59       that's fascinating. I wonder if that will change people's opinions if that really does happen to people can save a significant amount of money in taxes. The problem, the globalist admit they want a global consolidation, they want a global downturn to break. Her buddies will and accept all the new taxes and regulations. And so trump is racing. Remember they had for eight years he represented interest, but it was only the big banks. Trump said we're going to keep zero percent for one year even though he's against it, but for poor people to get zero percent interest. Who cares? It's all fee out anyways. The banks lose the money. It's all just write offs. They're killing it all now. And raising, raising taxes, trump tax reform that will make America great again. The goals of Donald Trump, number one tax relief for middle class America in order to achieve the american dream that people keep more money in their pockets and increase the after tax wages. Number two, uh, simplify the tax code to reduce headaches. Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everYone keep more of their money. So he's traveled. Plan, he's already implemented it though. 14

Speaker 7:          03:03:58       or 12 days in, we've already got. He's doing. So if you're single and you earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earned less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax shit. Holy shit. The taxes on portable, that removes nearly 75 million households all over 50 percent of the income tax roles. Other posts, they get a new one page form to send to the irs saying, I win those who would otherwise. Oh, how crazy is that? They get to save a new one page form to send to the irs saying, I win those. Those who would otherwise a owe income tax will save an average of nearly $1,000 each. Yeah, it's not that big. If you're the lowest bracket that pays taxes, you basically don't pay taxes. You don't want people to pay in. Taxes are for rich people. Rich, you pay big tips. You get it like these people need money.

Speaker 7:          03:04:55       But look at this statement. No business of any size from a fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. That's just plan this lower rate makes corporate investments inversions unnecessary by making america's tax rate one of the best in the world. Holy shit. We have one of the highest rates, so nobody wants to be here. No family will have To pay the death tax. Holy shit. You know about this deliver man that trump is for real. He's totally. You earned and saved that money for your family and not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it. That is so buick immigrants. His athletic applicant is a beautiful tax plan. That death tax is disgusting. So like if you left money for your kid, they would take half your money.

Speaker 7:          03:05:46       They take some dumb giant chunk of it and he's saying that's not gonna happen anymore. That alone, that's a beautiful thing. That's a very good thing. So trump has painted this painting land 70 of them and like they're like pushing by families with kids like carrie, carrie, carrie, like yelling at families. Just want going forward. They like literally pushed by like hispanic families and black people screaming kkk. And I looked at him on tape or just going like what feels good for people to have a clear enemy and if they can justify in their mind you're a white supremacist or anybody on the alt right is a racist or twelfth kkk. And I heard he's a rapist. Everyone's marching on the streets. That's what. Well, there's also a bunch of people that are looking for some sort of solidarity pumped. Maybe they were. Maybe They thought that hillary was a better choice and maybe they got excited that they could get together and join up and walk the streets. Anytime you can get people to get together for a common good in their mind at least. And no one gets arrested, that's a good thing.

Speaker 4:          03:06:57       Probably no traffic for a lot of people and made it annoying. What would you do if like almost half the time you go out to eat or in a grocery store, someone slaps you in the back and telling me that happens to you. Right? Well I wonDer where it's like they're interdimensionally connected. Like why is it always boom, you're a loser. Slap you in the face of the back of the head. It's like, how are they so with that was the greatest thing you've ever said. No, I'm serious. He just didn't fight it. A door for people going who you're a loser and then try to slap you in the back of the head. It's going to happen again. You started to human meme care. The point is, how are they so sync? Okay, here's the deal. Well, You have women going, allah akbar, why love god by the media, by the media, and I'm out there peacefully videotaping him.

Speaker 4:          03:07:44       The saturday after trump's inauguration in dc before I leave and they're like, eff you white male. They're all white women. I'm all out and they put hats on. They burke is screaming, I'm going to join jihad. You'll never stop me. I'm like, I'm not going to cut your genitals often. Put you on a slave block. I don't get where. I've never done anything to women and all these weird ass women include the dc police were letting people attack us. They were wearing these pink hats and then they get attacked. Praising. Yeah. Somebody was saying that you were drunk. That's not true, right? Absolutely not. I didn't think so. No, no. The truth is, the headline was Alex Jones kicked out of inauguration. They have people blocking the hindrances because they had it all fenced off. You could get in. Yeah, it was. The whole thing is, it's, it's very, uh, the whole movement is very aggressive. You know, it's like a response to what they think is a aggressive, you know, you're all over. They're slick asking questions. Mr john, we have heard. Let's be serious. What is your real worldview or the nature of consciousness on this planet and intergalactic space? I've been a been a really honest today and a lot of true answers. So metaphysically, what is the secret of the universe? This is what I think there was a little, a organism that was just recently discussed.

Speaker 7:          03:09:02       We did it, I think yesterday, and they think it was one of the very first organisms that was the precursor to what we eventually became. And then all biological life, all like living, walking things came out of this one multicell organism, right? Yeah. So one thing I think as that happened, whatever hundreds of millions of Years ago, I don't know what the number is, but whatever, however long, billions of years that happened to go, if we keep going in that same direction, whatever we are now, which is going to be totally unrecognizable just a few hundred years from now or a few thousand years from now, or if we just do it biologically a million years from now, but I think that if human beings managed stay alive for a long period of time and not blow each other up, we're on the cusp of figuring out how to manipulate our very beings like to the point where we're not going to be people anymore.

Speaker 7:          03:09:56       It's just going to chAnge. That's it. Yeah. Humanity is at the crossroads and that's my message today. The elite have decided they think the course of our evolutIon, I'm here to say, shouldn't we decided to have a debate about it? Well, I don't have. Some of the experiences is a great place for the people have this insatiable need for innovation. They're fascinated by it. They want the newest phone, even though their phone works perfect. Is that they just want it. They have this desire. It's a weird thing. It's just like we were talking about like these, these things aren't designed to make you addicted to them. You're just addicted to them. They're designed well. There's a weird sort of connection that we have to this technology and I think it's because of what marshall mcluhan said before. I think it's because of what marshall mcluhan said that human beings are the sex organs and the machine world.

Speaker 7:          03:10:37       I really think that's what they're doing. I think all of this integration and all this innovation of all this kind of the primary prevailing does compelling focus on technology is because evolutionarily that's where our biology goes. It goes to technology because it can manipulate it at a far faster rate. Our evolution, and I hear what you're saying, biomechanically genetically through round cells, not square silicon. We do it more beautifully and strongly. I agree with what you're saying. Overall, I don't think it's an either or. Alice shouldn't just expect alex. I don't think it's either. Just accept it. They're going to be able to do shit in both ways, whether it's integrating combinators longer, I'm going to do it. It's going to happen. The point is going to be screaming for a hundred years from the public needs to know this. Yeah, so I think the larger debate about it, well they do.

Speaker 7:          03:11:27       They are learning about it. It's just something that you have to seek out and it's really all the information is control. I don't know about that. The information about is about innovation and and artificial intelligence to up. They're letting a lot out of this constant study. If you were tony fucking Montana running the planet, would you let that shit out of what you keep it for you, but eddie, there's not. Tony Montana is not running science. The thing is these scientists are almost all involved in universities and different studies and they worked on the phds and trying to make a name for themselves. They're exploring all these different possibilities and then big companies that can profit off of it and billions and billions of dollars like sony or apple or any of these other companies, these people up and they're fucking. Hold on a second there thing is to innovate and make money.

Speaker 7:          03:12:08       That's what they're there for. That's what they do in the envelope and technology, but they're not. Tony Montana. do you understand this? You're talking about two different things. You're talking about some utopia? No, no. Talking about what it's trying to to benefit the point. Talking about what intel. Here's people who makes iphone, doesn't matter. We're having a real discussion about the future of the technological system of humanity. They don't want that discussion. She'll this things that whether it's joe or Alex Jones or eddie bravo, we're all having on the joe rogan experience a dIscussion the elite are having right now in Hawaii right now with zuckerberg. I know for a fact the elites are meeting with zuckerberg in

Speaker 3:          03:12:52       facebook to alkali, but the whole point is they're having this meeting. He owns facebook now and we should discuss what's happening. Is facebook part of the illuminati now? You know he's a bear shit in the woods part of it. Come on, aren't you? Look at alex that that profile. I know you do. I know you folks off. I know you do. Hey, the big issues of the world is he never asked me about ronald reagan. I want to know about aliens. I keep coming back to that because I want to know what do they know about aliens? What are you wearing? What are they real? Okay. I'll tell you right now, and what I say is not political and it's not from my particular perspective, from the known knowledge in the universe. We live in a third dimensional plane. We can see the planets and the galaxies.

Speaker 3:          03:13:44       The sun's hundreds of billions of galaxies, photographed universes. We live in an amazing space. Time continuum. The elites believe that it's not in the third dimension that we're mainly receiving transmissions. Ships don't arrive from elvis and tourists or gt prime for wherever they're coming from or meal. Jeez. They come here to inter interdimensional gates that are much closer through fold space, and so we have to discuss the different influences there in the universe and on fact that we have freewill and we decide what we want. I don't believe in any of this. I'm simply telling you what the elites believe. So they believed thAt there's another dimension and these beings are mentioned. They need baby blood, right? They need something. They need to tune in. Let me tell you, oh, we're really powerful. Were made the image of our creator. Our brain is able to tune into the lowest dimension, the hIghest.

Speaker 3:          03:14:46       At mentioned, humans are basically really powerful creatures that can live right close to sons that are highly radioactive. nothing else can live as close with very short lives because we're like a hive organism that actually lives second to second in the space time continuum. She's like 100 years, it's a second, and we transmit our data up to be able to live next to likely stargate jump gates that are, that are sons. So because we live so close to these sons, we only have milliseconds to be alive, so we're actually a hive organism that keeps transmitting up to the next species in our, in our, in a hierarchical system, and then down below us. So we're alive right now in this continuum and we're trying to progress and, and, and make things better. And the elites are trying to make sure that we don't doubt into that incredible knowledge we've got as a species. It basically dies a species so that we're not competitors on the next level as the bible says of their dimensional plane. But you don't believe that. You're just saying that's what they. Oh yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:          03:15:50       I'm not calculating anything. What do you believe? No, I mean, I believe in research. do you think that I believe in research to. Do you think that there is something from other dimensions that can access us? Uh, this, this, we are other dimensions. The third dimension is only one limited plane in a larger spectrum. Part of that spectrum. Well, let's just say we're not in Kansas anymore. Alex. Have you ever done dmt? No. Do you want to. I don't need to go to every night I go to sleep. I believe that he's done. It's like he's on natural dmt. Definitely on something man. For sure. And I got a question for you.

Speaker 2:          03:16:28       You know how this is, this is kind of off the cuff a little bit off track, off the beaten path, but you know how the cia has always been involved in hollywood and make movies and you know, like zero dark 30 and you know, all of these movies that are clearly propaganda movies, you know what I mean? Hold on. MosT like even movies you think they weren't propaganda, but they are. They like the superhero movies. How they're just all the plots and the evil. Oh they're going to build a bomb and all that is. Is there whistleblowers within hollywood that are making movies? Just like in Brazil it was a martial arts were outlawed. So the people, the people that were about the truth, they were like doing dance, but they were disguising them. Our clients. Is there a filmmaker? Are. They're filmmakers like that out there that are trying to help humanity with the basis of their films or is it all perfectly? It was like anything else. There's good people and bad people and I don't think hollywood overall is bad. Which, which movies are the good ones. Tell him because I watched star wars. I'm like, is this the bad one? That's propaganda. Street movies are good ones. The good ones. which ones are the ones I should go deacon nights.

Speaker 2:          03:17:40       what about like when a hangover one comes out, let me tell you. That's not because anybody that didn't like hangoveR. Go ahead. I'm oNly the name of like one part of the shadow government, whiCh is all the intellectuals of America. So those people are on trump's sIde now. Yeah, and that's the first time ever. Well, the cia has never been perfect, so they must've been with bush, right? Because bush used to be the presidency. I senior george herbert walker, so he was head of the cia. Here's the deal. The cia was shut up supposedly to defend the republic and do all this stuff. It got hijacked by multinational interest. It's been retaken and they're cleaning the shia out right now. Are you serious? That's fucking breaking god damn news shit up on info wars. The cio as cleaning house. Oh my god. Are you kidding me? Why isn't that the headline news on info wars right now, the rock tee shirt, a lot of folks did really, really crazy things for the cia. The cia does like the fighting

Speaker 1:          03:18:48       and they were all pissed off and they were portrayed by infiltrators inside the cia. really bad stuff that went on, but right now there is a counter kid within the cia going on and cleaned them out while they're definitely trying. Jesus christ. I like what I'm hearing. We'll see what happens, but are you? Are you happy about the futures succeeds? Within three years, you're going to hear major cancer cures announced. You're goiNg to hear a new energy systems announce. You're going to hear a new companies announced they've suppressed all this stuff and trump what good people want to empower humanity. They believe in the species and the planet and big stuff's about how god damn crazy would be if trump became a hero. He is, he wrote about, but do you know how crazy it was? Hit the. The country accepted him. If they figured this out after. If this is all true. This all comes through exactly as you're saying, which I really have no idea if you're right

Speaker 2:          03:19:38       and you know what you could play right now. How about that bill clinton clip that you played where he's talking about vetting immigrants like more hardcore than trucks and we're going to all that. everybody. How do you pull that? How does clinton and

Speaker 1:          03:19:53       bill clinton and hillary promote wall and the wall's got halfway agree, disagree with them on the wall? Because people do a ladder over. It's metaphysical. It's like we're a country. We're allowed to have this. Mexico has one. Canada has one account. Why can't we? The big thing is just deport people that are on welfare. We need people from Mexico and Russia and Japan and just to poor people that are on welfare. It's the only deport, the poorest ones. The ones that can't say if you won't do anything and you're calm here. Yeah, we'll call out. Okay, so when they come over here, you're saying give him a chance, but then once if they try to stay on welfare, that wasn't always sell more shit or not sounds

Speaker 2:          03:20:30       good. In 1995, listen, this is in 1995, just totally in the states, most heavily affected, but in every place in this country are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they home might otherwise be held by citizeNs or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. that's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards by deporting twice as many criminal aliens is ever before. By cracking down on illegal hiring, by borrowing welfare benefits to illegal aliens that I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who were arrested for crimes to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws.

Speaker 2:          03:21:29       It is wrong and ultimately self defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it if that doesn't vindicate fucking trump on all fence shit, but it also makes you realize what a bad motherfucker bill clinton was. His trump can make a speech that bill clinton was a good guy. Hit me. He hit each other walk. If you're a chick out there marching, talking about the wall and you just heard that, that was not a real realize. I'm giving you a chance. Admit you were pumped. It's okay. everybody gets powerful power punch. But from this point on, shut the fuck up about it will power. That's not. No. Okay. Let's, uh, that's about it. A time. Take one dose. If I give you full power, you're going to be in the hit.

Speaker 2:          03:22:29       It's five. We're going to wrap this up. We got it. We did a good job. Ask one more question. Go ahead. One more. I, I, you know me, I'm fucking fascinated with the conspiracy. They're just like you. Every night. Dudes are watching fights in boxing. I'm listening to conspiracy theories every fucking night. When I go to bed, I listen to Alex Jones everyday, everyday. The one thing that gets that I don't get. I get the establishment, I get the illuminati, I get all that shit, but then there's ronald reagan. Every now and then you have dr steve progenic on your show and he's talking about some serious conspiracy diaries. All this shit is confirming everything. He's deep in the cia confirming shit, but then when they talk about ronald reagan, they talk about like he was the last great president and I thought that actor, the guy was an fbi informant, isn't any, so god damn establisHment ronald reagan.

Speaker 2:          03:23:20       I don't get that. Explain ronald reagan. I mean george senior was the vice president, director of the cia and he just seems like the salt, but this is once in a while. Okay. ExplAin ronald reagan if you want to end the transmission. Let's explain. Ronald reagan. Go ahead. We're just joking around punching earlier. No, no, it's okay. But his question wanting more hours. He wants to know about ronald reagan. Hold off because I can trust telling me the movies. Okay. Ronald reagan. We're not in some blood fests with reagan, but after all the obama globalization, it's like I'm astounded. Good thing. Reagan ran against george herbert walker. Bush said he was global, a cfr world government. Then they told him at the convention, okay, you won, but we're going to not let you have the domination if you don't want to. Put a herbert walker bush, and then a year end they shooting.

Speaker 2:          03:24:05       They just released that guy and so all this stuff went. Oh shit, I didn't know. So reagan didn't get his agenda through and they tagged on Iran contra all this other stuff. Reagan actually wanted to get rid of the irs and a bunch of good stuff. So yeah, I noticed the anticommunist. He was running against George Bush. He beat him and then when he got the presidential nomination for the republican party, they made him. They forced him to take the drug store witH forced way. None of the ronald reagan and I wanted to believe in obama, but he's a total level of a new tax. Things crazy. Once you think of that, it's pretty radical. Joe Got mad at us trading punches.

Speaker 7:          03:24:47       Trump on trump. Give me. Took me up people. There's people out there that think trump is racist and they think he's a sexist at a whoremonger closer whoremonger sexist and I'm not. Okay, well good for him. A lot of people do. Okay, so you think he's a good guy? I know trump's a good guy. He at. What he's done is he's delivered like no president ever. Alright. Everybody. So everybody wants to find some reason to hate him and some reason to figure out a way to get him out of office, but we shouldn't. We at this point. I mean he, he won their game, right? There's a popularity contest. He won the popularity contest and that's really what being president is. Figuring out a way to get the most amount of people to say, I like you better. I mean That's really what it is. And he's the first truly popular person who's really good at manipulating the media to win a popularity contest. Everybody before him had just been a politician. He's the first guy that's actually famous that then became presidents two point. Oh, it's never happened before. Been a half hours. So reagan, that was the California. It's 5:00.

Speaker 7:          03:25:58       That's the only two and a half hours. Yeah, but the point being that he's. He wasn't that famous, famous like Donald Trump. I don't think he was famous movie star reagan. Are you cutting? True, but I don't think he was a big movie star. I think he was Christian Slater. She probably doesn't. Trump wasn't a movie star. No fence. Christian slater. I loved you in blade. Hey, who's in dade county jail? He was in blade, right? Ms dot christine slade and blood job. No, stephen dorff was. Well it was. So. It was ronald reagan. Did he get his. I'm ready to end this right now, but I'm telling you once in a lifetime interview, we haven't got that real questions. We're only two and half hours in five, three and a half hours. When we go live underneath what? Thirty will I have a 1:30. We're sitting in the chair before austin time.

Speaker 7:          03:26:45       Look at the clock right next to you. See, it's 5:00. Yeah, fine. I'm wearing louis. You want to talk? All I know is that most of your listeners should know, really told you the real truth of what I've researched. You shouldn't believe him as sham, their total corporate whores. What do you think is gonna happen? How do you think this is going to play out now that you think this sort of silent, bloodless coup is taking place and this guy has gotten through this net that had been set there to make sure that no one other than the people that were already inside the system could ever run it, so he got through. That was a. He's running it now. We're going to wrap up once in a lifetime situation. Trump isn't perfect. He really wants to empower humanity. All of us have to work hard, be involved here. Our views, put out our ideas and just move forward with the airplane to try to assassinate trump. You think so? Oh god. They're demonizing him saying killing them all. Fascinating. For real, or do you mean assassInated him publicly? Like politically

Speaker 1:          03:27:42       assassinated. They want to politically destroy his name and they want to politically also try to kill him. All I know is America had half the wealth of the world 20 years ago and five percent of the world population. We've lost half that wealth and it's that as we get more powerful, they get more powerful and the elite had been trying to domesticate America. Not that we're perfect, but we've got ideas of industry and ideas and doing things that change everything. And so The really this planet want to kill competition. They want to consolidate control. They want to end the internet of governments. That's America. They were about, if hillary would have won, they would have censored the. Oh yeah. How are they going to look it up? Look it up. I'm actually surprised how fast that's all. Putting the pieces together. There were about to do it.

Speaker 1:          03:28:32       Okay. Tell them the headline is obama establishes ministry of truth three weeks before trump takes office one week after a trump's elected. So ministry of truth being something that stops fake news, the news the government doesn't agree with, right? So The problem becomes, how do we decide what's fake science? Go back, please go back please. Obama quietly signs the countering disinformation and propaganda act into law. Wow. late on friday with the us population embracing the upcoming holidays and oblivious of most news emerging from the administration, obama quietly signed into law the 2017 national defense authorization act, which authorizes $611,000,000,000 for the military in 2017. In His statement, obama said blah blah, blah, blah blah. Whereas it say, he says lots of over the governor's board of governors, the fcc federalize the media, meaning federalized television shows and radio transmissions, your website, old galaxy. She your website, my website.

Speaker 1:          03:29:37       Everybody's website. What do you guys. What are you doing? She says obama last minute bills like all that shit. He signed shit. Read down a little lower. It says in the bill, we're going to federalize committee. Put it back. Was going to find a. We're going to federalize communications and put the cia over the board of governors of the federal communications. That sounds so crazy. Did you would have been subject to that shit. Could easily. You can't talk about that. No more. Of course hillary would have won. That would've happened. Dude. See, I wonder if people would have ever went for that. That seems. Let me show at trump does. He is like up till two in the morning. Everybody knows tweeting twitter video clips. He gets on the internet now. He'S a conspIracy theorist, which means any questions about trump? He's got. I'm not saying trump's perfect. I'm going to keep trump honest. Anything. I'm going to come out against him. The point is is that he's a different kind of thing and you can keep a rogue element. Nine slash 11. Is he

Speaker 4:          03:30:40       going to do anything about that? Already exposed the fact that elements of the government work with Saudi Arabia to launch the September 11th attacks 16 years ago, going to reopen that shit. He said he will. You think that. Imagine that. Imagine the re. Imagine alien bases on the moon. Please tell them to release that information, but the alien bases on the next question. What does he know about geoengineering? What does he know about aliens? Not. Not about aliens. Fuck, no, no, no, no, no. I want to know about chem trails. You don't say fuck aliens. Okay. Alright, let's do it. I'm back on back on Donald Trump call lately. I'm holding on aliens and alien bigfoot 10 years ago.

Speaker 4:          03:31:28       Go ahead, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Here we go. Hi alex. Oh mr. president, what's going on? Well, whatever the agenda forward to cut taxes. Do you think? Well, I should know about those secret space patients. Wow. Alex, you've got to come to trump tower for those meetings. I'll come to trump tower. I to know about aliens. Hey asked trump if he wants to learn some jujitsu. Half a fly to New York to be with. You want to Be drunk? I want to see the bodies. Alien bodies will go to a trump on the show. Alex, he mentioned trump on the show. That would be huge for him. Probably not a good idea for anybody. No. I don't know if he wanted joe. I don't care if you're too cool for this. Well, I. we have to get the fuck out of here for sure.

Speaker 4:          03:32:16       Let's talk about whether or not we're going to eat or anything else, but uh, it's already 5:00, so we're at a three and a half hours in. Is there anything more that you have to say before we get out of here? Let me get another question. Is it? No, no. Eddie, I want to ask alex. No, I mean literally I really shake the truth, tell the truth and force.com has all our articles, our research, our videos, our podcasts, what we do and I'm not left or right. I'm not liberal or conservative. I'm really trying to find out what's going on in the world. And so after all these years, joe has been a. I love really good questions. You kind of knew all of this. I was going to bring up. You just keep you just get crazy and you want to keep going and keep going and keep going to keep going.

Speaker 4:          03:32:55       But I think sometimes you got to go, okay, hold that thought. Expand and explain because a lot of times things that. But hold on a second eddie. Things that are in your head, self explanatory. You already know about it if there's a giant percentage of the people that are listening to this have no idea what you're talking about. I get it. I want to say this for the joe rogan listeners, have an open mind. You heard him for three and a half hours. Download that app. That info wars app started listening to him. Eddie, why don't you do your show and info wars. That's the move to eddie Bravo radio comes back on info wars. I would do that rogan's champlain, but listen, but listen. Okay, but. Oh, but listen, I'm focusing on effect. All

Speaker 7:          03:33:38       I want people, I give him a chance. He doesn't know shit about space, but when it comes to politics to. Yeah. When it comes to politics, he's. He's a fucking master. He's. He's like, he's like helio gracie and that's a compliment space. He's. Joe wrote about jamie pulled something out was he signed this countering foreign propaganda and disinformation act of 2016 to build. Expresses the sense of this bill expresses the sense of congress that what a weird expression. Okay, what are we looking at? This is that bill, that anti propaganda bill, foreign governments, including the government of the russian federation in China, used Him for this information, other propaganda tools to undermine the national security objectives of the United States and key allies and partners. The us government should develop a comprehensive strategy to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda and assert leadership and developing a fact base strategic narrative, and an important element of this strategy should be to help promote an independent press and countries that are vulnerable to foreign disinformation.

Speaker 7:          03:34:44       Translate that msm is on the ropes, are panicking. They'll want to shut down their competition. What american watching this or listening doesn't think they should decide what they should listen to it not. Do you think that would be ever accepted? That they would allow people, someone that works in the government to censor websites and podcasts. Vamos signed already happened. Yeah, but this one, China, they signed a bill to dry it. Whoa. Crazy. Notice how I tell you damn bill, one of the things about podcasts is that they're basically just a pure conversation. It's just peopLe sitting down and talking and if you. If you stop pure conversations, I mean that is like one of the most heinous formed. Essentially. It's too late. You can't say you can't make a try. You can try, but if they really did get into office and dave really did try to implement some sort of a transition process, I almost wish hillary would have won because that could have been outside the power.

Speaker 7:          03:35:40       I keep trump on the list, not attacked. Trump does something wrong. It's hard to find, but he makes some mistakes like torture, iphone codes or whatever, but so torture you think is just. It doesn't work. It's not just at work. It makes us look terrible. It's a foreign country lowers us to their level. Yeah, exactly. But trump came out and tortured two days ago and said, okay, so he changed his mind. He's good on stuff like that. That's very unusual. Waking up and when you wake up, you change your mind. I was also independently wealthy. That's one of the things that's probably a huge factor in this scabbing. He's not part of the obama. Hillary. That's what I'm saying is that there's no calculation. I just treat you like I want to be treated. Big stuff is happening. It's a very exciting time to ask you this. Before we. Before we wrap this up, you know, if trump is this new stage of politics or new type of politician, what kind of person do you think would be like literally the perfect person to run this country and would the perfect person

Speaker 4:          03:36:36       do ron paul? Ron paul is great, but I think as somebody who's worked hard in private business who really has a sense of success, who loves America, who has been through the gauntlet of demonization attacks and dealt with it, I think it's Donald Trump. I mean, you look at what he'S been through, man, who's been through this, been a winner over and I'm not in some cults, Donald Trump. I think I want to hate him. I want to not believe he's so good, but man, when he calls up and can like read your mind and knows what you were just thinking about, you're like, man, this guy is like god or the devil. This tax thing is very fascinating. It's very interesting people. It seemed to me the main street of billionaires are gonna pay it to me. Every time I turn on my iphone. You know what I didn't ask for fucking fox news bulletin.

Speaker 4:          03:37:25       They force feed me every morning. Sienna. So one of the joe rogan experience for info wars. That's why you gotta say chanel, because joe's real. I'm real. You're real. Whether we're perfectly, no matter. We want to be real. Everyone should humint human intelligence support this podcast and info wars and the joe rogan experience and make this dominant, which it already is. just to say, listen, bitches, you may force feed eddie bravo, a bunch of cnn, fox news shit every morning, but you're fucking getting the joe rogan experience up your fucking ass. Holy christ. Every time I turn on my phone and look at what a cnn trying to fucking force feed. Yeah. Since when does the iphone force feed you? The possessed demonic entity type? Just a second. Cooper. I trump disease. I'm on the anti trump, but disadvantaged super nice guy. He seems like a nice guy.

Speaker 4:          03:38:25       Cia. He worked there like in college right now. Beyond tHat, beyond that, he admitted it. He's part of the light whip. Cia. Real. Wait a minute. see I as a whip division if you're the aster family. lucky is or the vanderbilt, vanderbilt, john j.mr. Myrick smith. His name was my name too, if you. All right folks, that's a wrap. Now it's not. Know. Make fun of me at the very end. We're talking about dental transcending information here. Job. I think sometimes we're talking about info wars.com and joe rogan experience and andy bravo. No problem. Hey, Soon to return to do a rock and roll conspiracy theory. Oh, it's your network. If not, he believes the cia. Curious, how does this go as well as you thought beyond that or better? This was fun, which is awesome. I enjoyed it. I you think of it? What?

Speaker 4:          03:39:27       What did you think? Your nine slash 11. I thought it'd be exactly like this is as good as I could have hoped. We had good time. We had a lot of laughs. We talked about some real shit. We brought up some news articles that confirm a lot of crazy things that you're saying that makes me like all those new arrests there, new arrest about pedophiles and sex slaves. Like holy shit, if that's real. What story was, what news source was? That story was right and how many different is it like all over the place in India and a bunch of different news sources that one about the sex slaves and being released. It's associated children, so it's a mainstream story. I'm sitting here thinking trump is a major force global force right now. Trump and he talks to Alex Jones, Alex Jones, toxic joe rogan, and I'm here because of joe rogan.

Speaker 4:          03:40:18       I'm like, holy goddamn shit. We got some kind of lightening bolt going through the world right now, but it's not like joe's like. It's like all of us together. We're all there. It had to be like this for it to be like this every, every day before today, however it went down. How to be like this for us, for this to happen. Are you wanting to be better than eight years before I come back and joe, next time you're so you got to come and studio. We have to do an interview. ThAt store that foreign and 74 stories arrested was laying many, many, many major news sites. It's crazy how it's real. This isn't galactic thing going down right now, man. There's some interesting things are happening to people and it's happening at an accelerated rate and we're all part of it. Everybody listening to this, everybody talking to their friends and everybody rewind, awaken everybody, reading the internet.

Speaker 4:          03:41:02       Everybody watching documentaries and reading books. Everybody understanding that we know more about how things work today than we ever have before and it's weirder than we ever thought. Isn't this discovering incredible. The crazy thing is is when people aren't you, you're just not asleep and awake. You're asleep and then you're partially awake. You know about, oh, you discover, you saw zike guys for the first time. Oh, you're partially awake. You don't know about all this other stuff. So when you hear about all the other stuff, you still got that mentality where like, that's bullshit. That's bullshit. People are partially awake. Not, not everybody's bullshit though. That's the problem. There's a lot of wacky conspiracies out there. Monster dinosaurs aren't real shark. They believe it's a a greenland shark. Sharks or they think it's a shark that's like a millions, millions of years old and got into that water back when it was connected to the ocean because it's an ancient creature and they used to think they were extinct, but now they don't anymore. They found some. So they, they, they think the loch ness monster. That makes sense. Or like a tWenty five foot right about what you get your information from. Scientists from guys can't talk over each other, but that's what it comes down to. Hardly talking. I know, but he's talking about talk when you're talking about a greenland shark arm. No.

Speaker 4:          03:42:24       We end the show. Yes. Eddie bravo back. No, no, no, no. I'm gonna. fuck you up. And my left hand is my strongest because I'm south. Everybody have beautiful.
