Speaker 1:          00:01          Rogan experience, that's where that comes from. I mean that was just fucking tense.

Speaker 2:          00:06          Oh, it's the, it's the practicality to me, right? Like, yes, exactly. We have a referee, we have walls, we have whatever, you know, fans. It's entertaining people. But like I need to know, I need to know that. Like would that be in nature, you know, that'd be doing whatever that be selfdefence that'd be fucked. US fighting over a territory or food or whatever. Like I need to know what would happen. Like if we had like that's why I want these finishes. We only get 15 minutes to be able to tell ourselves what would have happened in that situation. You know? And when it goes to a decision, I'm pissed because I don't know, you know, like you don't know, especially these three round fights where I'm waking up like these last couple fights, like late in the fight, I'm pissed because I'm like, I don't know if that would have been another 30 minutes or another two hours that we're scrapping in the woods. Like who gets the bone? You know? I want to know. And so that's, that's crazy. And of practicality, and it's your survival and this is the way I get to know myself.

Speaker 1:          01:04          That's deep. Who gets the EU the way you just put it. Not only you've ever heard anybody put it that way. You need to know that the problem with vegans is the problem with people. It's not veganism, it's people. If you get a room that has 100 people in it, the odds of one of those people being a fucking idiot is a hundred percent. It's almost 100 percent that one of them is a fucking idiot. Yeah. So if you get $300, million people, you have 3 million fucking idiots and some of those folks are vegans. And that's the problem with veganism. It's not, it's not veganism itself. It's there's a certain percentage of human beings that they don't have to do anything to become vegans, right? They just joined this group. It's not like you have it. Well, we're, we're thinking about allowing you in to the Vegan culture, but we want to know what your philosophy is.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Are you a hateful person? Are you a person that's looking to be a Vegan? So you can just talk shit about other people, are you looking to be and are you looking to be in a group or a gang of plant based Gad and put the word Vegan in front of your name and just start talking shit because that's a lot of the people. And so people read all these angry, hateful things that these people, right? And they go, oh, well this is vegans, but it's not. It's not. Most vegans are not like that at all people. Most people are not like that at all, but there's a certain percentage of them and they claimed veganism and they usually put that name, the word Vegan in their fucking screen name. That's how you can spot those assholes. Yeah, they're proud. Yeah, they're into it. They're in a plant based gang.

Speaker 1:          02:37          That's really what happens. Yeah. And so what it is is not necessarily even a problem of diet. It's a problem of human nature, is that people love to stand on the moral high ground that will love to point down at all the other people. Whether it's a religious issue, like you're not eating Halau or you're not eating kosher or you, you're eating meat on Good Friday, whatever the fuck it is, they just decide that they have this moral high ground that you don't have, so fuck you. I'm doing it right. And it really comes from our own questions of our own existence and this messiness that we're all inherently aware of that life eats life.

Speaker 3:          03:15          So it's weird. But whole life I thought I'd be scared to death and most people we all are. We're all terrified of fucking dying because we don't know. But that was the closest I ever came and I wasn't scared. Like suddenly the fear just went away and it seemed logical. Like of course it's over, like things end and I didn't want to die. I wasn't, didn't have a death wish, but I was like, if it's done, it's, it's kind of, it's done. And count your blessings and be happy and don't be a bitch. Like don't. If, if the fucking fairy man shows up tonight, don't fucking hold out. Don't be the last asshole at the party. Go No, like just fucking pay the ferryman get on a boat and go, we'll see what's next and stuff and then ultimately late in time did a good job and I fucking wound up living and stuff.

Speaker 3:          03:57          So I know this much. I got to read a bunch of shit like after I nearly died and it was all nice. People wrote very nice things about me and shit and I expected, you know, creature of the Internet that some people be like I wish he had fucking died. Fuck them to death and shit. I wish he'd stay silent. But generally it was like very nice things. People were kind of positive and stuff. So I was like fuck man. Like you know, again, I didn't want to die but like if I had like that would've been okay. Now I'm back at it. You know what I'm saying? Like now until it ends like I've got a, you know, and it's Kinda easy as long as they don't wake up with a fucking dead girl are alive. Boy, I don't think like they'll fucking broke me over the coals when I die in the future and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          04:45          But it felt weird to be so close to the completion. And so having something that normally terrifies you suddenly be like, oh, it's okay. Like I don't know if you walked up and put a gun in my face, I'm sure I'd feel threatened, but like I kind of lost my fear of death. I'm not like death defying. I won't go out and do anything differently, but that, that dark cloud that kind of kills any good time. The moment you start thinking about like the fear and anxiety you're going to die one day, like you know it's gone and now all of a sudden I'm like, yeah, I'm going to die one day and it's going to be awesome, but not for the reasons that you think. I'm saying it's going to be awesome. Just be awesome. Because a finish like it's nice to finish things.

Speaker 3:          05:26          We know how good it feels in life to complete something and that's the biggest fucking thing in life you'll ever complete is your journey. So I didn't walk away going like I got to do more. Like I got to fucking live life to the fullest. I just got to keep doing what I've been doing. Like living life the way I enjoy it, trying to do things. Sometimes they work, sometimes I fail and Shit. Sometimes people are on your side. Sometimes people like you fucking blow and just do that fucking time. Have good conversations in the process. Meet interesting people here, new points

Speaker 4:          05:57          of view and shit like that and keep at it. But it's nothing to be afraid of. From my perspective. They were just calling me more name said trying to set up straw men. And is this egyptologist who is in that documentary who dismissed everything was still around. Oh yeah. And has he amended his position at all? Not to my knowledge. I haven't spoken with him for years and years and years. Did you ever speak with them off the record or personally alone? What is this? Oh, I'll tell you this, but he didn't say this off the record house. I guess it was off the record. I don't think I will shut this years ago, but I'll say it now at that debate, at that debate, AAA's debate. He, I just suddenly found myself in the hall with him and there was no one else around so he could totally deny this.

Speaker 4:          06:49          But it's true. My perspective, at least he, um, said something to me like, you know, you don't really believe this. I know you don't really believe this. You just won't be on television and, you know, be famous or something like that. He said, I said, no, I really do believe it. Or you know, I really go by the evidence and I do think the evidence says this. And he served was telling me that, no, you don't, you know, he was like, I dunno. I analyze what the sizing you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then he slept in and then, and then what he does is he starts asking me a question of some detailed question about the geology and well, if that's the case, how can such and such and I think in hindsight might have been fed to them by some geo archeologists just say call someone who does archeology but knows a little geology.

Speaker 4:          07:43          Uh, and I, I realize in hindsight it was meant to be one of those Gotcha questions. I guess they say nowadays where I wouldn't be able to answer it, but no, I had, of course I'd thought about it. It was to me as a geologist, very obvious. So I start giving him this detailed explanation as to why that's not the case and why, you know, my evidence stands up, blah, blah blah. And we're standing there face to face. I'm explained this to her and I see his face turn and it goes blank and I'm in midsentence. He just turns around and walks away. He's the one who realized he couldn't, he couldn't refute what you were saying. Refute what I was saying. And he wasn't really answered. My takeaway is that he wasn't interested in discussing it rationally or aunts, you know, he just went to win the debate or whatever. He

Speaker 5:          08:35          but, so, um, when, when Charlie and I met and I, like I told him what my plan to sort of help black America and wake them up because they understood how we had fallen victim to this brainwash, brainwash, the leftist dogma. There's this idea that because we're black, we have to vote Democrat and anybody that is not a Democrat is racist and against helping us. That is what so black Americans believe. I believed it. I believed it. You know what I mean? So, and I'm a, I'm a pretty smart girl, you know, I've always been a very smart girl. I've always, I've always been, you know, I've excelled in, in academics, right? So how did I fall victim to it? The exact same system, right? These three verticals, the first being the family, that breakdown of the family. The second one I'm being culture, which then to me like growing up it was like Jay z, Jay z was God to me.

Speaker 5:          09:17          Like I would throw on, like I was, you know, I went through a lot of stuff when I was a kid. I didn't have a great family, um, you know, um, but I would throw on a Jay z album and like whatever he said, it was like, it was like going to church, you know, and then, and I can't stand them now, but the third vertical, no, no, because he knows exactly what he's doing and he's a trader, but third vertical being education, which was casual side trader. Yeah. It's like, like beyonce because he knows what's happening to black America and he's somebody that built his entire career off the backs of black America, you know, of being. The guy who started in the honing in, in, you know, queens and worked at it was a drug dealer and worked his way up and it became the io for so many people in Black America.

Speaker 5:          09:58          And then he stands on stage and endorses Hillary Clinton. He stands on stage and tell us black America to put the same people in the White House that locked up more black men than any present history of United States. Bill Clinton, right. The person that stands on the crime bill of 94 is Bill Clinton. But because Jay Z is now focused on getting a piece of the pie, the globalist piece of the Pie, he doesn't care about black America. Um, that's, that's my opinion. Um, so what do you think that maybe he thought the Donald Trump represented a lot of racist white people? No. Oh God, no. Not even. Kind of. Not, not for a single second, Jason, because Jason is very smart. Just speak to him. No, I didn't speak to him. I just, I know there's a certain thing where like, I just, I know that Jay z and beyonce betrayed the black community. Like there they are. I think they did it purposely for financial gain. Yeah. I think, yeah, I think that they, they, they were interested in having, they want to be the people that control the world and they felt that Hillary Clinton, you know, they were working with Obama very closely and very clearly. Now we know that the Obama administration worked very hard to get Hillary Clinton to office and they wanted to stay in that group, and so they supported Hillary Clinton who was selected behind closed doors. Forget the American people to be the next president. United States. Yeah.
