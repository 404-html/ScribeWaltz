Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right, we're live. All Right, ladies and gentlemen. Vinny shoreman. How are you buddy?

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       Hello. I'm fine. How are you?

Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Good, good. Pull that microphone right up. Get it right up there. Um, we just did a hypnosis is hypnosis session. I will. How would you call it? Hypnotic session. Just a sexual stuffed mental training mind stuff. I'm vinny is the man that, uh, Joe Schilling, uh, experienced, uh, some fantastic results doing this with you. Joe Schilling, who's the world champion, kickboxer beltour fighter guy who's been in here before and he told me about you and you and I went back and forth on twitter and email and then we finally got together today and today's hypnosis session. And I'm here to tell Ya, hypnosis is real. It does. You definitely go under. There's something happens. You go to some weird dream. Stay at la La land. How long was that? Under four.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Four and a half days now. You were hungry to be honest about, I'd say 20 minutes. Twenty minutes. Maybe 20 minutes. Thirty minutes. You can kind of get lost in it too, you know, it seems like it seemed like five. No, it was longer than that. Yeah, it was good enough.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       It was like I remember the beginning part and then all of a sudden it was over. I was like, whoa. And there was some weird dream state stuff going on in the middle where you were talking about some things, but I was thinking about other shit, but I was. When I was thinking about shit, I was like, wow, I'm in a weird state of mind right now while I'm thinking about these other things. Like I better get back on track about what vinny?

Speaker 2:          00:01:33       No, probably not. I think it's funny because it's. I've done everything that I do with my clients and you've experienced, I've experienced and he put it right is weird. Yeah. It's weird because it's. It works definitely works well.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       There's different states that the brain operates in. We all know that are states when you're stressed out their states, when you're super happy, there states when you're very focused the states and you're in danger of the states and you're in love and we all know that these are weird places that your brain can go to. Weird frequencies are weird vibrations, whatever you would call it, but to be able to manipulate it like that, to be able to put someone into a state like that or help them, assist them getting into a state like that. That's a very, very unique skill.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       Yeah. I mean, oh hell hypnosis yourself at Nell's. He's anyway, so you do it. I just guide you into it, you know, and give you ways of just going into hypnosis is a natural state. Although he said, we said it was talking earlier like you know you're driving and all of a sudden you end up there and you think shit out to get there. I don't do that because I'm rubbish at driving, but you know other things where you just. It just seems it. Televisions, hypnosis, music set. Notice that all different states and we're all in different states all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       So I'm, I'm like a movie that just captures you and you don't even realize you're watching it. You're just totally. You're

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       inside, you're completely absorbed in the film. That's almost like a hypnotic state. Definitely mean clumping for Superman for instance. We know safe mother's next six exist, fortunately, I'm sorry to break in one's let's mom, but you know, it's just a part and parcel of using your imagination to get you to a place where you want to change. So, but, but that state that you achieve when you're, when you hypnotize someone, when you put someone in this really relaxed place and you have them focus on very specific things and you get them to this weird state where your mind is drifts off into dreamland. That's very different than a movie are very different than driving home in your car. It's, uh, it's, it's pretty intense. Yeah, it is. They're all, they're all imaginative processes anyway. You know, they're all my cheeses. Processes. But with hypnosis, you focusing on a specific properly.

Speaker 3:          00:04:00       Normally, you know, you focus on a specific treatment. So lit is the lead into it. It depends. It depends on what the client is. Um, I don't always use hypnosis. I am a mind coach. Don't class myself as a hypnotist. Although hypnotherapy is part and parcel of why date, I class myself as a mind coach because he's different facets to it. These different ways of leading people into fairies things and considerations about what they say, especially using language when it's out of sync sort of thing. Does it make sense? And then you might have to make sense of it and then unconsciously you unconscious mind deciphers it and gets you the best results really. Well, it's, it's fascinating to me because for the longest time mine coaches were sort of unheard of in combat sports. It was almost like it was a, uh, a scarlet letter or a, you know, a mark against you because you were so weak that you needed someone to figure out how to hypnotize you or how to talk you into being strong.

Speaker 3:          00:05:01       You needed a car. You should just be a fucking man and get out there and do it. Right. Like that was the attitude that a lot of people had. Yeah. In England say dealt with a fucking soft Glendale or. I say that in America too. Yeah. But they don't say it with that show to say with the same company to company telling them from the north. What I mean, it was a yeti solid macho, you know, don't you know, get on with it, blah, blah, blah. I've seen more people, a lot of very, very skilled get beat by their own self. You say not, you know their own minds and then they can be very. It can be very hard for people. The reason why I was going to bring that up because I think that fighting in particular is probably the most difficult of all chosen endeavors outside of being a soldier is the most difficult of all chosen, chosen endeavors as far as chosen goals that you're trying to accomplish.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       What you're trying to accomplish is you try to use your body, use your bones and your muscle to defeat other people who are also using their bones and muscle and the techniques are all readily available. There's no secrets anymore. I mean there's a few secrets. If you have a really good coaches, you can get some tips, but essentially everybody knows how to punch. Everybody knows how to kick and you're just trying to figure out how to maximize your possibilities, maximize your potential for victory and how to not get in your own way, not how to not trip over your own fears and anxiety. And that's where this mind coach thing comes into play. And that's where I think it's applicable not just for fighting, but also for just life in general because I think that for a lot of people, their success or failure, a big part of it is predicated on how they view life and how they view themselves and how they approach each.

Speaker 1:          00:07:00       Each thing, each obstacle, each, uh, each goal, each endeavor that they, they, they're attempting to, uh, to solve or to give their own expression too. And I think that if it works on fighting, it'll probably work on anything. And if you can get someone to a better place mentally where they can become a more effective fighter and stay out of their own way, has terms of their anxiety and their fears, like the reality of fighting is you're probably going to get hurt at some point in time. It's just part of what you're doing. You're in the hurt business, this is the hurt game, and somewhere along the line you're going to get hit and you're, you're hopefully going to hit the other person more than they're going to hit you. But bad things happen to great fighters. We've all seen it.

Speaker 2:          00:07:50       Yeah, I mean, Ace is part and parcel of everything. You know, if I could make. It's not just about fires. I mean I'll do what with fights is because I come from a background. I've been involved in it a long time, 30 years now. And um, it's, you have to find things out as you know. Well, of course, but finding yourself as well as an opponent as well as trying to listen to Econ as well as hearing people scream your name or other people screaming for them or the person to kick your ass. It's difficult. You have to, you have to kind of go with it, you know, and, and control everything that you do and then try and impose what you've got to do on the other person.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       You had doubts and fear. They're extra weights that you carry into the ring, yeah, or into the cage and in life and again it's analogous to life doubts and fears on top of the reality of the difficulty of what are you're trying to do. Whatever you're trying to do, those doubts and fears, they're like, it's like a heavy weight vest that you're carrying on top of the burden of whatever you're trying to accomplish in the first place and for fighters it can be just smothering it, getting it. I mean we've. We've had many instances of guys backstage that either didn't fight or almost didn't fight because they're having anxiety attacks because they were freaking out because the moment was finally there and their mind was just running away from them. Just your mom was trying to figure out a way out of this. We can figure out a way out of this. All we have to do is just go crazy here and the doctor will come over and you know, how about you have a few heart palpitations and fall down and you can't breathe, and then the doctor's going to rescue you.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       Fighting to find something wrong. With me, because a male, everyone's considered though I did the same thought, you know, if he sees something male, male and then you don't have to go in there, but you know, it's about controlling the fight so it wouldn't last in the changing rooms sometimes. A lot of the time, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:48       be the most self confident you can be the most confident motherfucker on earth. But if you're fighting Anderson Silva and his prime and you're not that good, you're probably still going to get lit up and that's a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       I mean, you can make yourself look as bad as you could as you would if you didn't do anything about, you know, maybe you know, there's only so much. Yeah, there is. Yeah, there is. I mean, not everyone's going to be a champion. That's fact. That is a finale, you know, but they don't throw these belts around day. The UFC and the WBC boxing, they don't just give you about, you know, and there's always. But from my point of view, I like seeing people conquer, share that really debilitating. Whether they win, lose or draw. Sometimes it's respective. It's the experience, all of them saying, I did lot better than I thought I would do when you know and and all that sort of stuff, and they can live with it. Some people lose and they just never forget it and it can hold them for real. That's not real.

Speaker 1:          00:10:46       Yeah. They defined themselves. That's a real issue with human beings. They define themselves with their past failures. Even though they've learned from those mistakes, they always look at themselves. It's like, God, I'm the guy who did this. I'm the guy who shit his pants. I'm the guy who got in that car accident. I'm the guy who showed up late and got her. I got fired from my job and you become instead of a human being who has a lifelong, just a giant string of experiences, a lot of them that you've learned from and that you're better because of instead you have the sting, like the emotional sting of those failures that just haunt people and that's very common with people that they get haunted. That's why some people are haunted by high school, by, by grammar school and high school bullies being bullied, like define them during their formative state. And uh, you know, I've known a lot of fighters who, they've carried chips on their shoulders deep into their forties from being bullied when they were in high school.

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       Funny Story, um, when I lived in a place in England called Michael's field and it's on a big hill where I used to live on a scene. The guy who's lived next door to me, his mom use limits, tells me Easter lived out as well. He was 60 something like that and I seen him at the top of the road and he was sort of surprised and he was looking down at the bottom of the road like this. He was looking again and he just stood there and I understand what you're doing. And when these two guys down there, they used to bully me at school and my firm to go 60, 60 years of age still I'm waiting for them. He was waiting for them to go. Billy's name is. And he was just stood there and waited for them to go that I, I liked to change and I will look to a change. It's sad. Think about it. It's a long time, you know, for him to, you know, and he's so small town Michael's feel worries to live. So he's probably bumped into them. It's probably avoided them in the store and shops or whatever for 42, 43 years. He says maybe, maybe, maybe more because before then. And I hate that. I just, you know, it's sad, it's real sad

Speaker 1:          00:12:48       situation, but it also seems to be bizarrely and cruelly, a part of human nature and common part of animal nature with the animals. Fuck with other animals. They try to find the pecking order and it motivates the weak ones to be strong. It motivates people to stand up for themselves. And that's where the bullying is a horrible thing. But bullying is also the reason why a lot of great fighters exist. Guys like George St Pierre. I mean he's pretty open about it. Like the reason why he became a great fighter because he was tired of people fucking with him and he might not have ever become the guy who he became if it wasn't for that pressure, if it wasn't for those obstacles that are thrown in front of his face, you know, and that's, it's a very, it's, it's, it's unfortunate that it happens. But objectively, if you step back and look at just life itself, it seems to be an inexorable part of our existence on this planet. There's a pull and a push and if there's no one pushing, there's no Poland and if there's no, you know, you know what I'm saying? If there's no, there's no negative. Oftentimes the positive doesn't reach the same heights.

Speaker 2:          00:13:55       No, it doesn't. Um, and a lot of cases. But if he can chip away at it or at least change some perspective on it for a person. This is why someone said to me, one, certainly want it to be a mind coach that I'm only gonna work with athletes. I'm not going to, I'm going to do therapy. So all therapy cell therapy, regardless if fighters, it's not always about them being noticed about fight in the finders and scatter. It might be something to do with the girlfriend, a loss of a family member, whatever, you know, it goes back way back to solve part of people's journeys. It's all part of people being who they are.

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       Therapy has a negative connotation in a lot of people's minds because they connected to self indulgence. Like go, you're going to go to therapy every day and just whine and bitch about your life. And Yeah, we've all met people that are doing that. You know, we've all met people that are just locked. So for them it's sort of more about having opportunity to use someone to talk about themselves. It's an ego trip in a lot of ways. Instead of trying to solve whatever, whatever influences that they have control over them. Say that again.

Speaker 2:          00:15:05       He gets to know as a mind coach. She gets to know who will do carry on doing that behavior, that secondary gay. Some people do their behavior just for, again, just to, you know, get themselves where they want to get is get really. Once again, it's a kind of decide from that I don't really, I don't play that game. I just kept them, you know, really, you know, and it just kind of, they can be kind of tough with it, but you know, if you want them to change, if they don't want to change, nothing you can do, you know, I don't want, I don't have these dragged out long therapy sessions of and then this and this and this happened in the up and I try and get right to it, right to the right to the core of it. And I'm like, because the way I was trained, I was trained by a guy called Collin Mci who's absolutely like Yoda, you know, my teacher and I was trained. I was trained that way and they see us. Good success.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       And you, how did you get involved with him?

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       Um, I got involved with Colin. Uh, I started, I went to a seminar many years ago by a guy called Keith Mayer and I was a bad time in my life, been a bit of an idiot in snow, in dancing powder, etc. I wasn't being the best it could be under. I went to a seminar, Keith Mayer loved it, felt great, didn't know why. I just really started reading books, everything, Dr. Wayne Dyer and all sorts of things like that. And then, um, I got older, I wanted to do a course with a, with a company and the company was gone, but I found out about colin and that was it. Since then he's become a friend and we're like east, just small, super small.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       Well, it's interesting because your main pursuit with this or your main focus with this as fighters, so you're, you're dealing with a very concentrated version of this kind of problem solving because of the fact that the existence is so intense. It's so difficult. Psychologically. It's so difficult emotionally and it's very difficult physically as well. There's so many dIscipline. There's. So, there's so many factors involved in, in being a successful fighter. And you were involved in probably like the most, the most concentrated form of dealing with anxiety and problem solving and the ability to see results.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       It's, yeah. To be honest, I never thought of it like that. I didn't because I've been around it so long. I never really thought of it like that. I just do what I do.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       Well, if you think about it, like the person, like say if a guy was I'm a banker or an insurance salesman or something like that, and they had a bunch of issues that are Keeping theM back from being successful in their chosen endeavor. The, their, you know, their failure pro

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       or con is only financial, you know, relative to them, isn't it? It is relative to that. The intensity of it. Yeah, like the intensity of a guy going into battle like yourself about to go and trying to find coughs and reasons why someone's going to step in and rescue you from what is ultimately your entire focus for the last six to eight weeks. You've been ready for this one moment and the moments here and you're ready to get the fuck out of there. Right. There's nothing like that in the world of noodles. Bankers suppose is not because I've been around so long. It's been around it a way. Tie sound. So many scenes. How many read he could fight isn't a gym. I also think in pot shop clenched. Every famous sweet spiring was on point and then just to see this different. I think of it like they should.

Speaker 3:          00:18:34       I really like making a really nice wedding cake and then when you can show it to the people are going to the wedding just fucking squash yet. So I always felt like, to me it's just like just destroyed our own creation. All the stuff that they've done in the gym. Maybe a better analogy is you will, you will that wedding cake out and it melts instantly under the hot lights on the stage, which is really what it is because when you have it in a regular room, the lights aren't that hot and when you have someone in the gym, I mean, there's a lot of pressure sparring and the gym of course, you know, there's a lot of, uh, there's great fighters. You're working out with people who were very dangerous. There's a lot of expectatIons and anxiety, but it's nothing compared to an actual fight itself.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       That's when everything's ramped up. Yeah, I mean, especially like you said, there's people that I've been bullied as well and you have to consider who you are. You have to consider everything about yourself, you know, going on that stage, going into that lion's den, so to speak. And you know, the gladiatorial sort of archetype of it all. But um, it's, it's difficult, but there is techniques at work really, really well maintained techniques that work really well to get the person out of these negative states of mind, these negative patterns to get them to get them because what can happen as you can go away with a train of thought so it might be five and goes on and on gets bigger and bigger and bigger than the south salt gets really intense so it trips you up completely and then can overthrow you to make you a minimum of what you can actually achieve.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       You know what I mean? And you've recently started working with my friend ian mccall, who was another great ufc fighter. He's very excited about the results. Very happy about the results. All right, good. I'm glad about that. He loves it. Yeah. We were talking about it and he was like, I'm 100 percent sold a real, you know, when I first try, he said when he first started doing it, he was like, eh, we'll see. But then, you know, once he really experienced it, he was like, okay, I'm going to be doing this from now on. Yeah, he's, I really like him because he's a real nice guy. Um, we've not done that much. Rarely did you work with them after his last fight? Did you work with them after the. I've only been, I actually don't know because, you know, no disrespect to the avid followed us. I know. I'm sorry, I'll leave now,

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       but I'm finished my coffee first. But uh, but he's like, you know, um, I think it was after his last loss. He said he was feeling things. Yeah. Was that the guy? A little stocky guide and just winning shots in jada? I, I, yeah, I did see that. And um, since working with them it's just, it's just about finding out who they are. Everyone is different and that's why I liked to work with people once I want to do seminars. I'm over here doing some else at the moment, but like to work with people to find out what makes them tick, to find out what stimulates them and what doesn't, you know. And we'll hold them up. Yeah, definitely. But ian mccall's a lovely guy. I really, really liked him. And joe, same thing. Yeah. Same people. Same deal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       Yeah. And you work with ross pearson as well as another

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       done. I worked with ross person. I was, I did some stand up. I used to teach my tie. It was at a gym called salford moitai on. I'm just holding pads. And so I kind of fell out of love with it, really teaching, etc. because mine coaching took over it. But yeah. What would ross as well, he didn't have a super guy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       So you're not doing muay thai training anymore. You basically do an online coach stuff now. Commentary for infusion. And for folks who don't know, vinnie useD to do commentary for each shoW time, which is one of the bigger kickboxing events in the world before it was bought out by glory. And uh, and um, now it's, uh, gloria is struggling a bit and uniteD states, unfortunately, I don't know why. It's just to me, I'm such a huge fan of it. I think, uh, you know, you watch a fight like simon marcus versus um, a arts and levin is a fucking great fight. I was watching it this morning again, and the gym was amazing. Amazing fight. Five rounds. Went to a draw. Yeah. I mean he's just a fucking war between two of the very best guys in the world. So exciting high level stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       I've never seen anyone trailer. I was in America last year with my friend brian dobler from fontana. I was, he was training their assignment was trading at his gym. I've never seen anyone train like men. She really, you know. Oh, well, he looks like a machine. Yes. Yeah, it does.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       Yeah. And his fight with joe schilling. Holy shit. What a fight. That was. What a fight. Yeah. And joe wound up knocking him out in the fourth round. They went three rounds. It was a draw after three rounds and joe knocked him out in the for this fucking crazy

Speaker 2:          00:23:04       joselyn get salt. This jail shit is like the guy up halloween, Michael Myers came down. He's getting buck up and he's special. And you were working with him before that fund was? I worked with them before the first glory. When he won it. Would it be the altima? Yeah, I, I, I asked him. I asked him. I met joe. uh, it, it was kind of, I don't know, I'll be honest with you, gerard, a bit of a chip on his shoulder. He was angry and stuff, you know what I mean? He won't mind me telling you this because he said I can swap beat me up. And um, he, yeah, he was, um, It was a bit like that and I seen him at k one because I did k one in los angeles while ago. I was talking to him. I said, your miles better than what you come across on the internet.

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       You're much better person than what you act on it. Kind of stuck home with him. He made me a friend on facebook and then a concept statement said, you know, joe, want me to work wIth you? And he went, yeah, sure. Cool. And then we got on. He's so smart. He picks things up so quickly, so open to stuff. We've done some really, really cool stuff that's I can experiment on joe, if, if that makes sense. You know, some things I want to try. I a dude him and he seems to work really well on him. So can you give us an example? Like what do you mean? Like things that you want to explain it. It's really strange, but he's like, I had to think about, because I'm, I'm english of sir galahad. They night gala hearts, you know, the knights of the round table, you know, king arthur and joel didn't want to get injured because he was gonna fight.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       I think you've robert something or other. He was fought on, on gloria and then he was going to fight on ballots or against melvin mom have any anyway to come out unscathed. So we persuaded his unconscious mind to have armor likes the gullah heart. So I talked in hypnosis about the archetype of knights, of the knights of the round table. And he will struggle a heart. Not literally obviously, but you know, so we had armor so he didn't come. So we come out on injured, you know the words, I'm not saying it's going to work for everything, you know, like I'll get, you know it bullets and stuff like that, you know what I mean? But it was just, it was getting his mindset into that, into that sort of the way of thinking. He was so worried about getting injured. So the, is that why it was effective?

Speaker 2:          00:25:21       Because it mitigated the stress that he worried about getting injured. A sideline can fuck you. God, I don't get her. I'll get her to that getting hurt. He's in the back of your mind replaying over and over and over again. yeah, indeed. There was one instance, liam harrison was fight and it's cycled cal some that I need for him before and got stopped in Jamaica and john wayne power for, against ballpark walk out. Pulper moc and I'm leaving had been stopped and it was a forefront with low kicks. So we did a hypnosis to make him called hypnosis in a triggered was warrior. You know, we kept this work because liam's, if you ever seen liam harrison fires, incredible fire. And along with Jordan Watson and andy house and all them from bud company in england. And um, what, what we did was we did, they said no, she said when I was coming saying on the show because he was fighting unaware in round four and it just freaked me out really to be honest. He looks at me and he looked me straight in the eye and he went worrier and then beat shit out of anyone when I'm points and yeah, afterwards I said, you remember saying worry anyway. No, I didn't remember it. So it was that stuCk in his hat. That was that. Well, in all fairness, he probably got hit in the head a bunch of charts.

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       No, I have no fucking idea who I am. I mean, how many times is a fighter won a fight and then asked what happened? Yeah. That

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       does happen. But I feel that I just state as well as both, right? Yeah. Yeah. We Saw them up a state that had not extended it. Yeah, that's what I. Isn't it in the japanese martial arts, I think you said it's a state. Did mohammed ali talk about it when muhammad ali fought cleveland williams, he was in that side kind of state. You know what's my favorite ali fight? I'm so glad you brought that up, is just any breathtaking. I've played that fight on this podcast at least three times in a state. It was in this flow and that's before he went away for three years before they took away his ability to fight cause he wouldn't fight in the Vietnam war. And then he came back and he was never the same again. That cleveland williams fight to me is like quintessential and people should watch, let's just showed his, his full potential.

Speaker 3:          00:27:26       But yeah, he was in that sort of flow state, but now way to get the same, you know, he's the way he's. I mean he, there's one fight, harold brazier, he moved up to light welterweight to remember and he slipped, slipped out of debit. I can't do it by like they slipped, slipped and they just steps around him and pat him on the ass and I'm like, come on now. That's ridiculous skill. Yeah. Well, whittaker is one of those guys that people kind of forget about, you know, like everyone wants to talk about julio, cesar chavez and some great fighters from that era. You just have as that I think you want as well. But uh, he was one of those guys that for whatever reason, people have kind of forgotten about him. Meldrick taylor, a lot of people have forgotten about them. Algebra taylor taylor were meldrick taylor.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       I shouldn't say this. When meldrick taylor last to christina spanner and I think he fought in Ireland or somewhere. Oh no, it was on. They raise the roddick and lennox lewis. Bill. I cried. I loved meldrick taylor. He was like my everything. It was, I shouldn't say that. She was like, oh no, no. But he was just. I loved watching him fight with chavez was just classic. Yeah. Well chavez changed him. He was never the same after that fight. No, after he got stopped in the twelfth with like seconds to go, richard blow to something else and that he was swallowing his own blood from the mouth cuts. But it was just, it was heartbreaking because after that he was just literally never the same. And I remember right now race destroy interiors is bouncing on his feet and, and then Terry Terry, now he's fucking out.

Speaker 3:          00:28:59       They're both fucked it just training, training, training. Golovkin isn't who his trainer. Abel sanchez. He's now training them up in big. I love, love, love can explain how he fights. He always talks about how he feels and emotion. He talks about how he feels and everything. You see him, even when he's in the park, he seemed feeling the shot, you know, he said he, he can see him every single part of them considering everything that he does. And apparently he's even beats people up. I think kai, that kovalev at last, at last have left that gym because of gennady golovkin. It really drops into the body shot. Yeah. He's a monster Who fights 15 pounds. Heavier. Real. I'm not saying it's rumors. Spread it up, spread it. Even england anymore in liverpool. I've moved kovalev and knocking on the doors. It was joe rogan's fault. He made me say it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       Kovalev was a monster to incredible and will quite dear to bernard hopkins. That was pretty shocking, pretty shocking to see bernard hopkins and fully defensive survival mode. Especially in round 12. I fought, I fought, it, looked like it. He let him off a bit in rounds, rather thought I thought he was chasing him down. I didn't know was very. At least it's on my friend's facebook and it yet I think names, but he, um, was before he was famous and uh, but he seems to like violent stuff, you know, it's a scary guy. He's a very, very scary guy. Well, he killed the guy in the ring one, a guy died and one of his fights. I didn't seem to affect him at all. You know, a lot of times like with raymond sini or, um, emil griffith, there's a lot of fighters. They'll kill somebody if I remove quickened did as well.

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       Didn't it can kill somebody as well. It didn't remember that. Yeah. But if something happens to them after that where they're never quite the same. Ben, ben was the same night. It's interesting, again, general mcclellan fund, if you listen to that, at the end of it he said says the first person I'd like to thank paul mckenna, hypnotizing me and making me believe in myself, and I met nigel been about two months ago and I said that after you watch it, the first thing you said, I'd like to thank paul mckenna for hypnotize me and I can believe him though, because they apparently had a separation of his wife and his girlfriend now fucks people up, you know, so there's a, there's a grief attached to it, isn't that, you know, and um, yeah. Nigel and I mentioned that to nigel banks have massive fan and I mentioned that.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       I said I got into mind coaching because partly it's because of how, you know what, let me go out the ring. He got knocked out of the ring the first round. The mcclellan was just a monster. Now was in his prime and to destroy your back then. And they were, everyone was talking about mcclellan eventually fighting Roy Jones jr. It was the big super far that was on the horizon, sort of like, you know, people are anticipating all the different fights right now for golovkin anticipating possibly kodo kodo. Maybe one day I'm canelo canelo alvarez. Yeah, that's a possibility and that's how they were looking at him until the nigel band fight and it looked like he was just going to kill nigel benn just just beating the fuck out of him, but two things. One, the weight cut issue. There was a big issue because a general mcclellan was huge and he was cutting a lot of weight to get down that week class and that was back when you know people weren't doing it well. They weren't rehydrating with ivs and particularly in boxing that the weight cutting mentality and wrestling is a totally different mentality because you could wrestle dehydrated and although your performance will probably suffer, you are not as concerned about head trauma and the head trauma

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       that these guys get when they're dehydrated is very, very dangerous because the bleeding on the brain is just way more devastating. Apparently all the deaths that have ever occurred or almost all the desks ever, ever occurred in boxing have occurred outside of the heavyweight division. And the reason being that those are the guys that are cutting the weight and the heavyweights aren't. But there's this one guy that got really fucked up on hbo like I want to say a year or two ago. Um, he fought that cuban kid. Uh, was it Eric Perez that he fought? Is that the guy's name? He fought. I don't remember. I'm not doing a good job of remembering it, but it was a rare instance of a heavyweight being like really badly concussed in a fight and having bleeding on the brain and having to get an operation. He was a russian guy anyway. Point being, but it was pretty crazy

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       when they did the documentary on a general mcclellan was, you know, a fun of gentleman. Cloudinary was knocked out. Julian jackson, not sealing chucks. I think it was like seven rounds maybe knocked him out in like one or whatever. But he sat on the second fight and the interview afterwards, when I fall, either first time I had a headache for three weeks. I had a headache for three weeks after fight, you know, there isn't a good sign, you know, that isn't a good side. And all of the, all of the documentaries of mr out because I watched it and I thought I remember because I just, you know, something sticks in your head and his fault. He's not mentioned. They never mentioned that he was apparently the, the spot really hard and all that. Boys from crunk. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       No, they don't cry jim. Not only do they not play these to crank that temperature up. Yeah. He was manual steward would crank it up like 100 degrees in that place. It was like a sauna.

Speaker 2:          00:34:20       He couldn't have no rap music, any swearing as well. And even believed in light. When lennox lewis for oliver mccoll, they made oliver mccoll were white box in because he thought that it made him move quicker.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       Hmm. Strange. it's strange stuff. Yeah. Emmanuel steward is an interesting guy because you so nice. He's so personable as nice. It was nice to know sadly, but he was such a nice guy and when a, when a trainer is such a nice guy like that, oftentimes it seems like the fighters want to fight harder for them. Like they want to win more. Like they have this more of like there's nothing worse than a fighter that has a contentious relationship with their trainer. And then there's like gang, there's some sort of animosity between the two of them. They leave, they come back and you see a lot of that and it really trips a lot of fighters up that those contentious relationships they have with their trainers.

Speaker 2:          00:35:13       He doesn't think. I think a lot of the times though with fires, sometimes it may take the position of a father figure, you know, or, or an elder brother or you know, especially a father figure because a lot of like have come from, you know, not the best start in life. You know, it's a main site. A lot of them come from a place with no father in the percentage that date, you know. So, you know, I always outlie trainers. I looked up to them and why it's a place,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       it's just, I just think it's part and parcel of it really. It is and I think that's why I got like emmanuel steward was so successful, not just because of his deep knowledge of boxing and his understanding of technique, which all were certainly there, but also just because he was such a great guy. He was one when he fought thomas. When thomas [inaudible] sugar ray leonard. I remember reading a manual steward and tommy hearns lot the cells away for two weeks and just cried. Wow. It's passion. True passion house. No, I know. Ring me and ring me and I was only 11. Were there any back then? Were there any. Did anybody use a mental coach back then? Do you know of anything? Is that when, when did it start in combat sports? I don't know. I'm the only one in the world and not saying no.

Speaker 3:          00:36:28       I don't know. I just actually, I've never heard of anyone that does it. I know these scenes is seen sports psychologists and stuff. I know that steve collins, before he fought chris, you started going about boxing. I love boxing. KeeP going. And when steve collins for chris eubank, he came in with their phones in and now in the ring and it played with you, but sad because nigel bennett used to hypnotherapists paul mckenna to go from old to beat general mcclellan and then you bank because he enjoyed, uh, Michael Watson so badly that he had. And he saId steve collins is like, they see. Well no, when he's hurt because we're getting such a state, he won't know when he's beat. You know what I mean? He was worried that was going to take too much punishment. Yeah. Or whatever the whatever the game was. But eight worked for collins.

Speaker 3:          00:37:15       Collins beat chris eubank twice. We might've beat him anyway. Might be. It might be a voice shenanigans isn't, uh, it's, it's, it's, um, it's mind games. Yeah. It's like the, the fragile psyche of a person that's about to go into, on armed combat like that. It's really interesting because most people would think of them as fearless, who just the toughest motherfuckers on the planet about to step in between those ropes, duke it out, but meanwhile there's a press, they're bouncing back and forth and there's, there's doubt and fear and all these different things that are playing on their mind. Um, you've seen the Mike Tyson movie, right? Yes. The documentary. Yes. That one thing that he did, that speech where he described what it was like to walk into the ring and what he felt like and now he had all these doubts until he got into the ring and then we'd gone into the ring.

Speaker 3:          00:38:06       He was a god. He hit me to used hypnotherapy. Didn't know diddy customer always to. I hit out in yolo show because I didn't know I had one of your guys said, I don't know. He was speaking to you guys. Remember? I know. I wish I could remember. Remember, remember latter my feet law sometimes. But um, yeah, he was talking. He said that customer, you use it, use it will. Custom model was certainly one of the first and most prominent to talk about psychology to a fighter and it was a main point of focus in like interviews about tyson, where he would talk about the things that d'amato told him and mano in the footage that they have of him. You know, there's many, many different speeches that he gave to tyson that we're on recording. Yeah. And you know the one about fire being a friend.

Speaker 3:          00:38:56       Yeah. Figures. Like I'll tell you, I really like, I liked freddie roach, of course. Produce credit already liked coming to pick us up, whether it was over the moon. It's like a little kid. He's a very nice guy. Very, very, um, very, uh, accommodating. Well virgil hunter, if we just want virgil hunter sets a got metaphors which it learning stories. He eight and he eight. He says a lot of cool things I like about life and about. I think if you've got experience of life and connect, you can convey it in such a way that it helps that stops more policy or I think. Yeah, I mean and, and moved To, you know, from the female side, the way she trained kirkland, you know, there's probably very few trainers as ferocious in the world. Is that woman. yeah. Some of the training that she used to have that guy do that.

Speaker 3:          00:39:48       The big one, punch knockout, cheeky fucking bad. she could've shot. That was a chick that christy martin avoided lecture was on fire get away from me. She didn't want to have nothing to do with that and wolf and there's a great video of an wolf driving a truck and harness on the front of it with a heavy bag hanging from, say, kirkland's backing up. Doing is heavy, bag it up. It's fucking fat. Anything when he fought canelo didn't have her in the call, but like that shock canelo he went down. We're all, well, he didn'T train with her and he didn't have her in his corner and she was actually still managing them too. It waS just, the whole thing was a mess. That's unfortunate, but you know what canelo might have done that to him anyway because it was a motherfucker I'm telling he's dangerous and is all there is a whole lot, but he's like, you know, think it's prince doesn't even.

Speaker 3:          00:40:41       It was amazing and it back in his day when he left blend angle, they had a really close relationship from seven and you know, old irish guy and he has got loads of still racing, you know, metaphors and blah blah blah. And when he left wink a bank, which in sheffield, it's not far from me. He wasn't the same. He wasn't saying like tyson and kevin rooney. It just seems to have a gel. They seemed to know another system that works. We'll look. Tyson was incredible. I felt like kevin. Well kevin rooney was still a part of the custom model legacy. Yeah. No, he had trained under demato as well and they kind of carried over, but he didn't have the same relationship with kevin rooney that he had with custom model where it was he wanted custom happiness. You want a custom models? Love, he wanted a custom model to father figure. I mean really literally was, I mean he took him in, but again,

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       it comes back to what you do and what your focus is, where it is really about mental states, that mental state of wanting to please the father, wanting to please this mentor wanting to this person that you love and care so much about their opinion and their, their idea of you, that it becomes a significant motivating factor and that tapping into these factors, tapping into whatever it is that allows you to achieve that amazing state of success.

Speaker 2:          00:42:04       Well, that's why I like to get my clients. I like to get to noma clients in a, in a, in every way because then you get the best from them. Then there's a saying that's less than 100 percent. Support is sAbotage, so if you're not getting 100 percent with them and then giving you 100 percent but never going to get what you know, what you can really achieve, but it's like, I like to really get to know them and understand them. Once you to client elo is going to be a client forever, you know, I've got a support system where again, as the same lit off, colin is like, you know, they, they get back to on a regular basis and I never keep out of touch with them because you always want them to know if they need me, you know, I'm not needy, I don't need to be needed, but I like, I like stating concept with them right when I'm successful of it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:48       Well, you also develop a project and you develop a relationship with this person. That person becomes a project. Yeah. And so you seem to get a great thrill out of other people becoming successful, which is a great quality and that's the exact quality that you need in order to be a mentor, you know, in order to be a coach in order to be the best coaches are clearly the coach that gets personal enjoyment, has a real deep investment in the student getting better. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:43:20       I just like, I have a lot of. I get a lot of praise of coaches. Mark, mark anthony's, mark kamora who's jealous coach. Um, I was talking to joel facetime and then mark says you've done a really good job. I, I really like that. I, I, I don't know, my son, my son will come across a bit. Um, I dunno gushy, I just love it. I really love it. I just love the way fi is. I like people achieving. I like people getting out of darkness. I know. No, it's like to be there. You know what I mean? And it's nothing more of a relief. The not being a, you know what I'm saying? Just put the right direction. See people just glow and they think you only get that eureka moment, the light bulb moment where they've done something wicked or they've done something they didn't think they could do that for me. Priceless. Do you get paid for it? Of course it's a job, but it's priceless to me. Priceless.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       Well, that's probably why you're drawn to it. One, that's why you're good at it. And that's what you, you kinda have to be that right in order to be good at that job. like the worst thing you could ever be as a mentor is be jealous of the success of your students.

Speaker 2:          00:44:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       Or to hope that your student doesn't do as well, but we've all seen, we've all seen that from coaches. I mean everyone's seen self sabotage from coaches. That's dark shit.

Speaker 2:          00:44:37       Yeah. Yeah. It is. There is, there is an element of, there is an element of jealousy and the or whatever in some and sergeant and people. It's a lot of times it's like former competitors. You know, you know, I, I think, I don't know if you agree with this, but I think when a, when a coach has been a fighter, there's a transition from him being still a fighter to a coach. You know, I've got a friend called frankie elders. It's got a really good jimmy and women's shelter in manchester and I see that with him now. He was a fighter. Very good one. And I can see the transition now of how he is. I've been a coach. He's like all these kids that look up to him and you know, like a Jordan watson's coach, Richard Smith. He is the same and they got this sort of, you can see the transition because they were fighters and then they'd be gone. Mentors and coaches that I like watching that. That's interesting. It's an interesting um, metamorphosis.

Speaker 1:          00:45:28       Yeah, it is. And it is an important metamorphosis too because if you always identify with being a fighter, you never going to be a great coach. You have to accept this new stage of your life and embrace it the same way you embrace being a fighter to do it with 100 percent of your ability and your focus. It's hard for some people because at the end it becomes not about them. It becomes about them helping other people and some personalities and not really suited for that.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Well, some well fires are about them. I mean it's know certain. Not all of them but certain amounts of it has to be about them because they're, the ones are taking the risk. They're the ones that to get in the beats aren't me go in the ring and take the, take the shocks and take the, take the pain, you know, the main. So it's, it is difficult for a person to transition, but that's with the change of values. As you get older, your values change in you, you start to shift from volume to value.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       Do you like it? Do you have longterm goals as far as like what you're trying to do with mental coaching?

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       Um, yeah. I mean I would like to get into coaching people to be mined coaches. I want elite people. I don't want bullshit. I don't want that. I want people are as passionate as me, so we're going to be doing that in 2016. Mccollins got a um, a thing now. So if anyone wants to know about, they can get me on my website, [inaudible] dot com or facebook or whatever because hypnosis page under can tell them about ace. Got a, a new sort of a series of videos where, and go step by step to learn to be a mind coach from my, my long term goal is just to get, just keep improving and keep getting better myself because I love it. Read and all the time a bottom quite boring really. It's going on about it to people. Um, my long term goal is, well, look how well Mike Doyle say stone movies, dire.

Speaker 2:          00:47:21       You know, I'd like to be that. I'd like to get that to be the, the, the, the, the months ago to the goto guy. I'm not enough of a people that have the same passion, you know, regardless of if it's fighting and all people that just want to achieve or at least get something better a little bit further. If not, it's really far. How many people do you work with it or not? Fighters? Quite a lot. Yeah, quite a lot. What's a common thing that they come to you with? Confidence. Everything is confidence. 90 nine point nine percent of stuff. It's confidence and just, yeah, confidence and people. People come to me, it's always the same thing. They come In because I work from home or to work on scale, skype or face time and they always talk about what they don't want that. so first thing out of everyone's mouth to talk about what they don't want and we asked them what they do want.

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       They still talk about what they don't want, so you have to change the direction of the thought pattern because they're just so focused on sates up rock and roll, the rock, the rock, the rock, and you have to just move them to where they want to go and then say, now what you want instead of focusing on that now where do you want to go now? What you're doing, what you okay, and we deal with that and in in various ways, timeline therapy or hypnosis or whatever, and then we move them towards where they want to go to. So when you're dealing wiTh someone and their issue is confidence, what are the myths? What are the factors? What are like the things that are holding people back? Are there common factors that you find over and over again with people that keep them from being confident?

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       No shit. Sherlock syndrome, I call it this way. You have to be like sherlock. I have to like thinking holmes english and he has to think about things. What really is going on in there? That's that sweet. So cool. That's why it's so exciting because everyone's different and out there sort of, you know, a thing that keeps them back or whatever. It is strange. Everyone's different. it's whether it'd be a past relationship, whether it be a, like you said, bullying, whether it be parents, whatever, or a current relationship or a current relationship. Yeah. That, that's, that's toxIc and they shouldn't be in it. I don't tell them not to because It as ecologically it's not right ecologically that mulhall psychological, psychological, not right and good for the environment. It's not good for the environment. Oh, by violent language, screaming and fighting with the message. But um, no, I just think that they have to figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       And you kind of know anyway, you, we've met people that you think and you shouldn't fucking bananas or bananas or whatever. When I was young, I used to try to talk to help those people are just to try it or tell them, hey man, you shouldn't be in that relationship. You don't get no facts wIth to figure that shit out for yourself. You don't get no thanks. So everyone's going to be mad at you. Her, him, everybody. Yeah. So, so, so it's about the environment, the environment around them is ecological sort of in some ways. Yeah. And it's also many times whatever is holding them back is also with led them to be in that relationship, that toxic relationship in the first place.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       Yeah. unfortunately. Yeah. Yeah. I've met people that their relationships is really essentially like a carryover of their mother. And that's always so odd. It's like I have friends who can't do anything and unless they check in with their wife, they have to ask their wife for every purchase. They have to ask her why before, any decision, anything they want to do. They can't say hey, uh, I want to go to the game with mike, you know, you can't say that. You have to go and ask permission and see if it's okay. And would it be alright if. I mean he is a people that aren't even married but you. But because you travel and I travel because I know come and st infusion and y'all college stuff you. If you let a girl friend of mine scenes can be in my life getting married in august, if you want that sort of lag, you're going who you're with and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       You're not goIng to. You're never going to eat. It can't work. I've had those before. They're brutal. Horrible. Yeah. It's horrible on both sides. You know? It's brutal. It's brutal for the man's brutal for the woman and it's brutal for the woman that's asking the man where you going? What are you doing? What? It's a terrible mindstate for her to be into a smaller about them than it is about, you know, it's more about then what that company through that insecure is that I've done that myself. I have to not myself. We feel that it's, well, it's very difficult to, to grow inside of a relationship because it seems like you have to have your own shit together before you can attract someone with their shit together. So if you don't have your shit together, you usually wound up with wind up with someone who also doesn't have their shit together and it's very difficult to, for the two of you together to work it out.

Speaker 3:          00:52:03       Yeah. Like attracts like. Yes. So oftentimes people like they really do have to break up in order to get on with their own life. The potential. That was shit that they work. Let's bring it to the next one. And then it becomes a cyclic behavior. It's difficult. Well that's the weirdest one. When you get involved with someone and then somewhere early in the relationship with her screaming at you and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on here? Like what is this? Is this what you do? Let's boundaries, isn't it? If you've not have, you know the on overstep the boundary and all this technical further back and then you end up not being used. It is. And it's also patterns that people fall into because life is very confusing and because life is very stressful and there's a lot going on.

Speaker 3:          00:52:50       So they fall into these patterns of making the same mistakes over and over again from one relationship to the next because there's comfort in those patterns and you recognize it early on because there aren't any real issues like we've only known each other for a short amount of time. You already fucking screaming at me for nothing. Why are you screaming at me screaming at me? Because there's some other shit. You've got the trapped dealt with it. It's an unconscious behavior. It's an unconscious reaction to a situation that's not been resolved and they think it's normal. It's normal to scream because maybe they grew up with people screaming at each other or hitting each other or whatever. Like,

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       yeah, yeah, it was easy. And then you tolerate it. Then that increasingly it gets worse.

Speaker 1:          00:53:31       Yeah. And it's interesting how those sort of relationships can become. You can drown in them. Yeah. You know, both parties can drown because you just can't get out of them and you're. You're constantly involved in conflict or the worst is conflict and resolution. Conflict and resolution. Conflict and resolution. And they get trapped in thIs high of, of making up and fighting and then making up fighting and making it up.

Speaker 2:          00:53:57       And meanwhile, you're life's going. Yeah, you're losing days is time. Time is a time is something you just not going to get back at the. Hey, you knoW, regardless how rich you are. I went to, um, a seminar by a lady called dolores ask off. No whiskey. Who's, um, this is part of the thing called the severance of light, which is an eastern cervical belief school. Servants of light. yeah. I hate it. Already know. I know they state, they say it's an easy thing. Still fun to do with me. I didn't name it that. Don't play me some of the things that she said that some of the things in the seminar said very relevant. You know, she was talking about um, so tell a story about time saying that when she was in, um, he lived in jersey, which is just south of england and they went in 1940 something or other.

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       The germans were coming to invade and she had to evacuate. So I said, well look, you know, you're not gonna, I'm not gonna buy anything for your birthday. We're gonna have to use all the money to be evacuated because it's going to go and live in has wall, which is near me and liverpool. And he said, well, what I'll do is I'll give you a, a bulk with paper and I'll give you a time. so every time you write a check he writes that you want to be with me and that time. And he honored that time all the time. So it made me think about how important time is. We just don't get a lot of it. You know, I'm 45 now, 21 yesterday, you know, in my eyes, you know, my mom died in, when was it? February now, august, last year. Bomb. You know, your mom's there. All of a sudden the garden, they smarter in Poland and yet we get tight, I think. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       it's everything. Yeah, hundred percent. It's every. It's also very difficult to stop and take account of what's going on in your life and try to figure out whether or not it's serving you to the best of its ability. It was as If time is serving, you have, you are serving your own life. If you're your, the your focus and what you're doing, your actions are serving your own existence to the best of your ability or whether or not you're trapped in momentum because that's often the case of people being trapped in momentum. Could rob you of your life and you won't even realize until it's too late. Isn't any of that 60 year old guy on the hill looking down at the guy's boeing

Speaker 2:          00:56:05       can out the window with the blanket. I going bust it. Can I go again? No, you can't. There's no. There's no second floor with the diocese, the, you know. Yeah. It's just the way it is,

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       but it's also really hard to figure out if you're trapped in an environment where the people around you haven't figured it out and there are stuck in some patterns, alcoholism

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       and cigarettes and all the bullshit that's involved with whatever they've got going on in their life. Crime or drama or whatever the fuck it is. This environment, this environment that you're not sure in the patterns that you develop, that's really hard for people to break out of. The patterns that they grew up in. It is and it's. But it's part and parcel of the job. You can't say any more part and parcels said got loads of time. Five. I did a podcast the other week and I kept saying all the time. Yeah, that like is one that drives me crazy. Like if I catch myself saying like if you like, I don't know, like there's maybe like a way to like, oh, shut the fuck up and if I catch me, if I killed myself over liking or overing you knowing, you know there's like, you know, it's like the worst is, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          00:57:15       Like that's a rapper thing? Yeah. Well, like in england you don't get rappers. You have right screw downs, prep poems. You can over there daily with hip hop. You should get them into douggie fresh. Oh my goodness. Okay. Fresh and doug e fresh and not saying big rat. Remember roxanne? About being on picky with. Come on sunday. That's good. Good. You know the greatest, the greatest. That without a doubt. The best that ever did. It was indeed wasn't a. It was the motherfucker right there. What do you want me saying? How dare you? Biggie, biggie, biggie. Can't you see sometimes hypnotize me. I just listened to classical music. You don't. Don't kick in the door waving the full for all you heard was pumping. No hitting. No more. Mr. Why do you think I should have been a rapper? I think shield. I think you were shitty mind coach.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       If you really believe that maybe we should swap. Have you ever told someone that they should be doing something different? If you ever told someone, hey man, you need to fucking quit your job and become a rock and roll star or anything. No. No, no, I've told people they shouldn't fight really because they're not good at it or because they take too much damage. Oh, okay. We know that you've seen say fucking. Well I. Oh, I thought about only had one fight. I don't fight mba class and b class in england. You can meet to the hat. Oh, fun bd class. And like not the best idea ever. No. say it nicely. So you, you told them they shouldn't fight because they're coaches were shit? No, not coaches, but yeah, just so risk. It's an early, early risk. And why would you tell them that instead of telling them to get a better coach, you do invest in it. Lee. He just pushed him in the right direction. So then some people just know some people shouldn't fight and never really get it. Put it together. Well you did what I do for the ufc for it's showtime for

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       many other kickboxing fights. And when you do that, you do see people that kind of don't have a chance. Yeah. You see, you see a bunch of issues, know whatever it is. They're just there. They're so far off. Where they need to be like

Speaker 2:          00:59:39       crushes an must. Tavi sometimes. Yeah. Nsa's contrast tv. But like it's. He says palm possibly. What they did it again,

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       you parked. I just did it again. Sorry. But like I'm like, mismatches. Trouble me more than almost anything. I know. It's one of the things that I really like about mma as opposed to boxing is boxing. Guys would get tuned up, fights start, catch weight, think about, I don't get the cat's weight thing, catch weights for mma. It's usually because someone got a last minute fight, right and a short notice fight and they don't want to cut all the weight. Like say if a guy fights at 1:55, like a glace and bow. He fights at 1:55, but he really walks around about 185 and he cuts a lot of fucking weight and so he has a process to cut that weight and he has to. It's pretty scientific. They've got to kind of stay with that process. And if they don't like benson henderson, when he fought brendan fache, princeton henderson, former ufc lightweight champion, took a fight at one 70 because it was a short notice fight, stepped in and fought at one 70. And the reason why I fight at one 70 is because he. This way you wouldn't have to cut the weight and he really wouldn't be able to take a short notice fight at 1:55. It's just too hard to lose the weight. Like they have to do it over a long period of time. Otherwise they're significantly weakened. You know, they get down to a certain, you know, 10, 15 pounds away and then they dehydrate

Speaker 2:          01:01:00       themselves. Don't get why. You know, when cattell fought daniel gale weeks ago, why they made daniel gale lay lie ariette cattails got the middleweight title of one 60. I didn't get that. What they agreed to, they agreed to. It was 1:54, right? Something like that. I'm just thought I didn't get it. Strategy. Yeah, I understand that strategy. And stanley said business, but when was the days when that's what your way he waits. He was the champion at that would've gillware would see walking around a lighter weight middle bite. I don't know if he's a big middle. Well, maybe kudos thinking about fighting floyd. And so he's working on ms dot fay fighting lighter and lighter guys. and it's payday right in dates, but it's like one 60

Speaker 1:          01:01:50       champ at one 60. And also there's the golovkin fight, which is one 60 that he might be next in line for gfi. Have they decided, is it going to be code? Oh, a canelo. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:01:59       I think the big fight, the big fight because I do think that cuts out when mayweather. It'll sell. I don't think so. No, but I think canelo and canelo cotto was a big, big fight. Converse. He's mexican, so he's big isn't it? They don't lIke each other for some strange reason. You don't so that, that'd be good. So to speak the same language.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       I don't get an addy. Do you think it will all console? It's hard to tell. Um, cotto certainly has taken more beatings, you know, a lot more weapons. Yeah, we hits a lot harder. He's a scary fuck areas, you know, you, you know the margarito fight I think took a lot out of kodo. It was a fucked up fight. When you find out his history of, of loading up as his raps, it was hot. Yes. They fight wasn't easy. No, it wasn't a real heartfelt yes, but the margarito fight was fucked. When you find out that he most likely loaded up his gloves with plaster, what does this say? Cotto canelo winter to fight glove in november. RighT now they haven't officially booked it. Ooh, I'll see that. Fuck yeah. Cotto. Canelo will be a great fighter and a great fight. Rather in the winter.

Speaker 1:          01:03:13       Fighting golovkin would be giant, but nobody wants to fight golovkin because only boxing fans know who golovkin is. Every mexican on the planet knows what canelo is. You know a lot of spanish fans and boxing fans know khan. Canelo is not ready to deal with that left hook. Some motherfucker, dude, boom. Yeah, he's a motherfucker. He hits very hard, but really for me, it highlights my appreciation for me. Whether it's technique, maybe say what you want about him as a human being. He seems to be, you know, a less than favorable human being, man. But goddamn as a boxer, he's magnificent. Bull. Admire his talent. He's magnificent animal. He's a magnificent. I mean, he's, he's the best ever in my opinion. I don't think he's the most exciting ever. I don't think he's the most fan favorite, but it's the art of hitting and not getting hit.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Who the fuck is better? you know, like I had this conversation with max kellerman about. It was like sugar ray robinson is so much better than him. I'm like, sugar ray robinson lost a jake lamata. You're telling me that floyd mayweather would lose to jake lamata I'd tell you, you're out of your fucking mind. I don't think jake lamata would lay a glove on him. I think Florida be all over the fucking place. He'd be slipped into the lab and slipped into the right and popping that jab and lead right hands and tying them up and I just can't see him. He's always the way that wasn't at fault. Hit me, blah, blah blah. They always do that, they always do that, but I just think sugar ray took a lot of. He was an amazing fighter, but it was a different era, different mentality, different style of fighting back then, different knowledge database. People knew more about the effects of fighting. Isn't it always will and always will. Yeah, definitely. That's one of the most exciting things about mma today is that you're seeing these guys like these higher rodriguez. He's young kids that are coming up 23 years of age and have so many fucking tools. It's like you compare them to young people coming up 10, 15 years ago. There's no comparison in mma. It's a much larger jump than boxing. We've got uninfused your life. We've got a couple of kids called allied mohamad your to too.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Two moroccans. You train moroccans and they can fight that moroccan magic. I call it days ago, bought her hurry up, but us psychosis of compensating them loads and loads of science or I could just stay out of jail and stopped breaking people's legs and shit. Yeah. You know, he's just behaving. Self stop being. The reason why he's so good though is he's a fucking psycho. It's part of the reason why he's so good. He's made. I'm not gonna say anything derogatory about it because no might find me. Well, my, the derogatory things that I'm saying are all positive to psycho stuff is the reason why he's so fucking good. Yeah. It's the most exciting kick boxer in the world was so aggressive. Have a look at your writer and then he asked belied yet they don't see them. Kickboxing is kickboxing at a higher level now than it was 20 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:06:08       much higher. You know, I'd say the miles, they generally has 19. You know, leo says a generalized 19 yesterday. No, les is 18. 18, 19 only young kids. They've had 210 fights. Phone line, you know, um, her and that was know the so nice kits, the so nice. But getting in them rings and they just fight like fuck. And then when they get out that treats like, hey, hey, look at it and hamburgers and fries and very happy. And you're like, no, I'd rather people that like celebrating and getting drunk and all that. That just chips. Wow. Wow. Keep them away from pussy. Well, I'm not going to sell it starts. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:06:59       It starts with you already have this super, really, really good kids. You know, he's just so fast and sharp and technique and everything. Well that's one of the things that perturbs me. The mondo that were disturbed me the most about about glory. It's like I just, I see it, I see the level, like the nikki holt skins and you know, the, the, the, the high level of fighters got into boxing now I think is he's doing that every student as well or he's going into it. But I know he's boxed a few times now so he might become a boxer in state a. And I know he's still in it though and it's not really common for a dutch fighter to go into box. And I will think tyrone's dabbling with it. Say so as well. I'm not really. Holland has not really got many boxes.

Speaker 3:          01:07:41       well, tyron fought his last fight because it was recovering from his broken leg. Broken saki. Yeah. Which was devastating. It's really rare to see a high level kickboxer break his leg like that. That was unusual. Yeah. But he, um, I remember him saying to me years ago at showtime in brussels, he said that he wanted to fight david. Hey. He said I want to fight david. Hey, I want to do boxing. I will fight. David haney said that to him. David haye seems to me to be a really good fighter, but a little too small. Yeah. To beat a guy like, like vladimir. Yeah, like the klitschkos just fucking these giant guys. He can't really reach them now. You know, now he's in a lot of them. His next fight will be against tyron fiori fiori from, from england. Who's the, who's the funniest guy ever. His tweets are funny and hilarious.

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       Makes I have a chance. Do you think he has a chance? I hope so. I hope so. I don't know. I don't know. What I thought was interesting about vladimir klitschkos last fight is with the referee was admonishing him for holding and he was taking, he was saying same was going to take a point away from him for holding that fucked this whole game up because whole game was like, pop that jab, pop that right hand tie you up roughly povetkin. Yes. And that was like bop bop, jump and grab and pushes it down and starts this whole game. And as soon as that goes away, then he's forced to stand with guys in trade and exchange. And you know, he's been knocked out a few times. I don't really do that against fillery because fuel is bigger than him is actually bigger than I am.

Speaker 3:          01:09:11       I hope she stays for the same area as me, so. Right. But that's just nationalism. If you take away that objective objectively, do you think you can beat him? It's not easy. Not easY. So that's a no. I'll say, I'll say no, but he could also flooded basement. You know, it was the last person. Knock him out. Was it corey sanders? No. Someone knocked him out after corey sanders. Right? What was his name? I don't know. I remember at 4:00 in the morning for no reason. Like a black guy. American. Um. Embrace. Yes. He knocked him out after corey, right? Yeah. It seems like to knockout losses in a row, wasn't it? But he just on that. Just consummate professionals. Well, that's another manual stewart success story. Emanuel steward figured out how to get him to box. Right. And you know, probably engineered that whole style that he's developed to this.

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       Just pop and grab style. Well, none of. None of manuals. Students with the left hook as well. Haley. It was all long job, right? Ons, you know, like hearns. It wasn't really like big left hook is. And what about mccallum? Didn't mccallum fight under a manual? Mike mcconnell in the body. Snatcher maybe famous left hook to Donald Curry. Left to the body. And the left upstairs was he. Was he just do it that I believe he was a drunk guy. I believe mccowen because he's a video. There's a video of um, inspiring with mcclellan. Oh, that's just the nice classic. This live. It's so, so amazing to watch cheese, isn't it? It really is an art, but it's also an art with a very short amount of time. You could pursue it and the very limited number of times you can get hit, you know, and I think I got to show as a shallow existence. That's one thing that used to disturb me most about mma gyms maybe say 10, 15 years ago. These guys really didn't have a. There was a shouldn't say these guys. Some gems really didn't have the best, most

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       tactical striking coaches that had a deep knowledge and understanding of striking. So these guys would be beating the fuck out of each other, just like the throwing bombs at each other in the gym and you would watch it and they weren't working on technique. They weren't working, they weren't sparring to get better at the art of hitting and not getting hit. They were just wailing on each other. Yeah. And you know, that was toughening them up in quotes, air quotes, and then they would go into the gym or go into the ring and fight and they were carrying all the damage that they were accumulating in the sparring sessions. And a lot of these guys now are kind of speaking up like jamie varner, who's a former wec champion, a top lightweight contender in the ufc just recently retired. And he's talking about the amount of sparring that he did and how fucked up it was.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       Also, he was sparring with much larger guys who was sparring with ryan bader have fights at two. Oh five. And he's fighting at 55. And bRian baiters class at two. Oh five. So he's fighting a guy 50 fucking pounds heavier than him. He sparring. I'm in The gym is madness. It's still Texas wedding. Sad, doesn't it? Fuck you in the kitchen studies debut last year. Say that I think it was in Brazil, was that. I know. Anyway, dot ringtail from ace from just the same. It relates to on the same road as made lives in Brazil. Now darren, tell east goodman a south by is very, very good kid as what child for him, there's a lot of good talent. Now. this is an amazing time for mma. I mean this is such a. It's such a young and blossoming sport. There's the level of striking is slowly and steadily getting faster and faster and better and better.

Speaker 1:          01:12:49       It's so. It's really an amazing thing to watch. The jujitsu is getting better. Everything's getting better. There's no comparison whatsoever. I mean, I don't know what the difference between 1993 kickboxing was. I mean I know there's, if you watch like andy hook or mike bernardo, there were very good, but they're probably not as good as badr hari. Right? But the difference between say fighters from ufc one and fighters today, I mean you're talking about a massive evolution like generations of evolution, like a thousand years of growth, sort of amazing. It was no comparison whatsoever. It's going to scan it all, letting very quickly from mistakes. So what people have done Before learning very quickly and also accumulating the techniques from other disciplines, because a lot of the guys who started out, they're really only good at one thing. Either they're really good at striking or they're really good at grappling.

Speaker 1:          01:13:38       That was basically it. But you're getting these guys today that are great at everything and that's just a small complaint isn't a complete. It was fragmented, wasn't an first ufc started. It was fragmented with people at a jiu jitsu and male smith was it was he pat smith best ones and he was the one dutch guy. Which guy? Blind alando v or whether it be books in lifetime. Twice. He was just on all the dunks and yeah, he was dangerous. Same traIners. Ramon decker called calamities with glory. Now he's the matchmaker for glory. He. He trained him. Yeah. Yeah. He was an interesting guy. Early on in the beginning were very good. Thai boxer, but a good example, the guy who didn't know how to grapple and he would get take down to the ground and just smashed he in. They got beat by a dutch kid, wasn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       The elbow wasn't. Yeah, goddammit. Rem co pardue. Yeah. Rem co got hIm in a headlock, took him to the ground and just blasted his brains out with elbows. I mean he elbowed him like four or five times. Guy got chills mixed. That was an important fight for people to realize that ninjitsu is bullshit. A lot of people really believed they were going to karate chops on people. Yeah. The, the level in compare. Well, that's also one of the reasons why performance enhancing drugs are so prevalent in mma. It's because there's so many different things that you have to work on. Like if you're a boxer, okay, what do you have to do if you do your road work and then you're gonna do your boxing work. You know, you do your sparring or your pad work. I mean, that's what you do. Spar x amounT of days per week.

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       The other days you're, you're hitting pads, work in the bag and doing your combinationS, but you're only working on one skill an mma. You're not even just working on boxing when it comes to striking you gotta train elbows, you gotta train kicks, you gotta train knees. You've got to train a different stance because you're worried about being taken down, so you have to work on your sprawl. You have to work on. You take down defenSe under hooks, wizard, step away from the cage. How to get back up. Then you have to work on your jujitsu, you have to work on sweeps, you have to work on actual submissions and you have to figure out like what, what, how much can I do like, yeah, and you have to get fat as well. Exactly. You see a guy like cain velasquez, you never see tHat guy attempt to submission, never attempted to submission and all of those ufc fights because it's the only so much shit you can do.

Speaker 1:          01:16:06       So he takes guys down. He just beats him up, you know, instead of trying to like, you know, learn all the chokes and all the. I mean, I'm sure he probably knows them, but applying them in an actual fight situation, it's almost like there's too much to learn. And so when I went to, when ncfc, when russ pearson fault columella at, then I realized how dangerous these guys now I thought, shit, I can just kick. He can get you on the floor. Right? You know, not topic now is don't kill me. Yes. Basically don't break my arm. Dope. Right? My leg don't kill. That's very um, macy's reality isn't real. It's real kumbaya, isn't it? It certainly is. Yeah. And that's one of the reasons why mma is become so popular is because it's so difficult to go from that to like floyd mayweather versus pack.

Speaker 1:          01:17:00       Yeah. Or it's not much happened. It was like a lot of movie, which I loved. I loved that fight. But the, the reality of the variables, like the different variables that exist in mma where god can take you down and garden, kick your legs so I can do so many different things to you. Can't just stand in front of him and shoulder roll and box and then clench. Just so much more going on. The clench is just the beginning. I'm going to press the up against the cage and the pull your ankles out from andrea. They're going to mount you, elbow you the face going to cut you open. It's going to be a lot going on. It's not nearly as simple to defend yourself as it is in a boxing ring.

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       hey straight. Because I mean it's just like looking at the most. They deserve the belt to get the belt, the ufc belt. He must deserve it. Stuff. They have to go for it to get that to, you know, to get where they want to get together. Once a gaze. Ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:17:48       Well there's just the beat the fucking murderers row you have to go through to get to any shot at the title. It's like the guys you have to go through today. Anybody that's fighting for a title today, like fuck man, you gotta earn that just goddamn massive group of contenders in every way class that are dangerous shit. The way got the right mindset. Yeah. You've got the right mindset. Do you anticipate that this mental training thing is going to be a part of every fighter's camp in the future? do you think it should be okay?

Speaker 2:          01:18:28       I think it should be because you can get, you know, it can be in shape. ThEy can, you know, the strength and conditioning the right day and then if their ads are not right, the body didn't perform.

Speaker 1:          01:18:38       Now what about applying that to kids? What about applying that to kids in school? Not fighters, just people in, in school. Um, especially in high school or in college where you're about to go out into the world and so much of your success or failure is predicated on your attitude, your mindset, and how your, how your brain is organized and inflammation. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       Yeah. I think. I think a lot of it is just, it's not really. It should be. There's so much stuff that you can do that that's, that can help people learn and take in information differently than just the cliche. Read that. That's what you gotta do. You know what I mean? Is. But it's that many phase. So that's why it's so interesting because these people are so many different types of people, siemens ways of thinking, you know, like we did earlier. We did the larger member. Why? We want to explain what that is. How come I always, I'm a slight self-induced. All hypnosis is self induced haka. We say self-induced hypnosis thing where you, you basically, you find a spot on the wall that's higher than your eyeline. So you'd imagine that you're looking through your middle of your eyebrows and what you do is you focus on a spot on the wall, um, and you just allow yourself to just imagine that you can see all the way to the left and all the way to the right. You can imagine, you can see really high above self and below yourself. And then you can imagine that you can see 360 degrees. And what it does, it opens your periphery, opens your peripheral vision, so it gives you a slight hypnotic state and it's a slight, a more feeling of wellness in a way, you know, how relaxing, what that feeling.

Speaker 3:          01:20:19       And what we did was, you were, you were telling me to concentrate on that spot and then visualize magnet.

Speaker 2:          01:20:28       Yeah, that was, that was different what, um, what we did was we did hakalau first to, to kind of lead you into a hypnotic state, um, to, to get you to cause you know, you know, you don't go, you say these things on these rapid inductions. And I went on a course of rapid inductions were, and what does that robert inductions as a color snap induction. So what they do is, if it's a slight, you put, um, it's like a shock shock. The system shock them and then they, then you go sleep or whatever and it puts them under very quickly. You see it can see it on youtube and all sorts of adult. I can do them. I'm a very showy techniques as well. Um, but I don't really dig them.

Speaker 3:          01:21:09       How does it work, like shocked induction, your sleep because your mind needs information, your mind needs you, your unconscious needs information

Speaker 2:          01:21:16       so you can like. There's one way you shake hands with someone so when they go to shake your hand that your hand, you break the pattern and make them look at their own hand and then you say, look at me, look at that. Focus on that is a confusion technique and then you say just focus on your hand or that government had sleep on nigga wonder just like that. Yes sir.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       Why or why do they go under? Why don't they go, what the fuck you doing in my hand, man? Well there is always that possibility. Hand smelt it. What? I've seen it done, I have done it.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       I'm with people, but it's all I've done it when I've been in therapy with the client already because I'm sulking hypnotic language in and do various things and stuff and just maneuver them into that state. So I really, you see people walking up on the street and these cheap hypnosis and all up, which is street hypnosis is a few guys that do street didn't know. She's a very good. Vince lynch is very good. Did

Speaker 3:          01:22:12       he do it like was doing in the street in vegas? He was making people's hand stick to walls and why? It's really. Yeah. I don't see god and it's, it's. Have you ever seen it? No. Oh yeah, they do it. Yeah. It's this street hypnosis. I've seen street magic. He's not street hypnosis, huh? Yeah. So they make people forget their names or removed the number four. So they go one, two, three, five, six, seven, eight, nine slash 11. But uh, it's fun to watch, but I know there wasn't an interest to you because what you're trying to do is improve people or help them live their lives. It looks stupid. Know? Well, when I was a kid, when I was first starting out doing standup, there was a guy in Rhode Island named Frank Santos and he was an r rated hypnotists. And up untIl that point, I thought hypnosis is bullshit

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       until I saw this guy over and over again, many, many, many, many, many times. He had a night once a week at stitches comedy club in boston. So I saw him dozens and dozens of times and he would hypnotize giant and he knew when people were under and when they were bullshitting, he would get guys who would look at them and you go, no, you're not mean, this is not working. You're faking it. Come on. And he would take them off the stage. He knew when people are under a new, when they weren't. But he could get a whole group of people maybe like bring 10 people on stage and by the time he's done hypnotized them, six or seven of them would be totally under. And he'd have them doing all kinds of ridiculous things. Like they thought they were having sex. They would come in their pants like, like really amazing. I mean I know for you you're thinking like, this isn't helping anyone. What he wasn't trying to do that he was trying to put on a show. It was, you know, people pay to see it. It was funny

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       pay to see it and they want to go on stage freewill. Um, I've done it before we part and parcel of

Speaker 1:          01:24:03       part and parcel of, of itch. Is that coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee.

Speaker 2:          01:24:10       Well anyway, sorry, don't worry about that. So I don't, I don't think that it just doesn't do anything, but how are they doing that? Um, because it's, they, if you go to a hypnotherapist and they say you can hypnotize me brand fuck off, what did you come fall right now? What's the point? you know, you've got a piece or to buy a pizza, you know what comes here. He comes, get hypnotized, you know, half go along with it anyway, you know, and, and it, and it helps. If the client's got an issue they want to change, then the more likely to change if they want to change with you, you know, um, but the, the people that do on the stage, they just, they want it to happen sooner than they don't mind looking daft. So that's cool. But why did with you is we did the modern as well, which was just logistically stood way because we did the peripheral vision and then we just imagined that there was a magnet that could say negative energy from your body and what that does is you use your own imagination to take that negative energy out.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       You do move is because it a weird

Speaker 1:          01:25:19       still for what is happening there really, because obviously there's no magnet and your mind thinking that negative energy is being pulled out of your body. Is that just an adjustment of your attitude or an adjustment of your perceptions knows? Who knows?

Speaker 2:          01:25:33       Who knows, but it will. Alls I know is it works very, very well on east relaxing and

Speaker 1:          01:25:38       is that related at all to what Frank Santos used to do by getting an entire group of people think that they were doing wacky shit in front of an audience

Speaker 2:          01:25:46       because it's. Yeah, it's the installation of what is the installation that's different. You know, there was no matter she sat and not having sex. It's an installation and it's

Speaker 1:          01:25:57       right. But I didn't really think that there was a thing. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:26:00       I know. Of course they don't, they don't. They go on there for that experienced or thankful for the experience, but it sort of respected where they believe there's is the end result if you feel more relaxed.

Speaker 1:          01:26:13       Right. It's almost like a placebo effect. Right? Yeah. So the placebo effect or the mind perceiving this change and then adjusting your attitude accordingly. Yeah. That, that's what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:26:28       He says just a redirection of thought, redirection of focus.

Speaker 1:          01:26:34       But that was different than the hypnosis part because the hypnosis part, when you hypnotized me, like I was definitely hypnotized. Like I definitely could see. I could listen to your voice and I knew that I was hearing your voice, but I was in this weird sort of dream state. Yeah, I was aware of it, but not aware of it. Yeah, like if you took my pants off, we'd have a problem. I would be, I would have woke up. And what the fuck's this guy trying to pull? But you know what I'm saying? Like he's trying to pull you out. It wasn't true, but I wasn't, uh, I wasn't eating it. It's a weird state because you're not, you're not totally there, but you're kind of there. Is that a good way of describing it? Yeah. Yeah. But you still dry. You're not gonna do anything that's against your values anyway. Really. But you're going to do anything.

Speaker 2:          01:27:14       Yeah. Well like, but wouldn't anyway because I'm not like that. I'm not like that as a hypnotherapist or as a mind coach. And um, what we did with you is we, uh, we, we got you to focus on your thumb. That film didn't say your thumb, thumbs. He disassociate yourself. Instead of saying your thumb thumb, we focus on that film and then you just get your focus on that. And then there was a structure like a, as you want to free yourself for. It's for, it's called to do that one, two, three, four. You know, see, see it just like counting down as well. No, do you account we know but using numbers, you know, bright say so cause assault of, you know, focusing on that. If you're focusing on that then your unconscious mind. So you folks in that not, and I'm talking to you with language that, that your unconscious mind recognize it to be relaxing.

Speaker 1:          01:28:03       Are you aware of all at all rather have, um, like the concept of like a manchurian candidate? Yeah. What do you think about that?

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       Um, have you ever watched derren brown, derren brown hypnotist, brown? Yeah. He's, yeah, he's a, he's a, he's an entertainer. He's a magician as well, but he's fantastic. And he did one called the experiments that you can watch them on youtube. And he did one where they shot Stephen Fry. Stephen fry is like a, uh, english, a comedian guy and a very posh, very, very, very intelligent guy, member of mensa herbal, super smart. And they, uh, he got this certain guy, they did a lot of, uh, elimination techniques, you know, to see what was most susceptible and they use a certain guy to go and shoot Stephen Fry. No, not with a real gun obviouSly, but just whether, I don't know. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know. There's a case where I, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       what he assassinated, someone who needs said definitely I was under hypnosis and everybody's just saying that while he's in prison, don't know, you know. Wow. So do you think it's possible? Um, we, you, you would know, right? Probably more than 99 percent of the people on the planet. I think if it's against your deep level of value, you won't do it. But what if you're fairly shady but innocent? Oh, that's darkness. That's very right. I mean, if you find a guy who's not maybe never killed anybody, but maybe he's done a few fucked up things and you can talk back guy and doing something like that through hypnosis. Possibly. Maybe because you're essentially steering someone towards a crime that they ordinarily would have avoided. What did you say the, it's again on youtube, uh, italian. A hypnotist and took money off the cashier. She got just took money out of the register.

Speaker 3:          01:29:58       No, still not derren brown played on television. No, he did it. It was captured on cctv camera. Oh, so it was a thief. Yes. And they were, there was one where devin brown paid with paper, so what it did is it got gets paper, which is the same as like dollar bills that's just blank paper and he said there's a confusion technique, so he said, don't quote me on this, on the script, but you sat down and I just moved into the town, I just got off the train and I don't know whether to go with that way or that way because my friend said you have to get the terrain but don't know where to go that way or that way or that way. But do you know where the station is? But he said, get the tanks. Just take it, it's fine. And then when he's, when he's said said, just take it, it's fine.

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       So confused as the people say that way or that way. So just mixed directing your thoughts. He's moving his hands everywhere. She thinking, what's this guy on about? Then he's saying take it, it's fine. So when he's giving them money, he's like, look. He sAid, oh, can I buy that? And he just gives them paper and that, that's still confused, not for long because they assume comradery, but it confuses them to st. Take it. It's fine. Take it. It's fine. So these. I've worked at a, um, like an ice cream place when I was a kid, sort of ice cream and hamburgers was supposed called newport creamery. And I remember they had someone came in and they called a flim flam artist or someone would come in and they'll give you $20 and they'd say, can you give me, um, a 10, a five and five ones?

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       And then they would say, okay, okay, actually can you give me a 10, five, five ones and four quarters, no, you know, what, give me two tens. And then they would start to tens of five and four quarters now. And then all of a sudden you, you'd have More than $20 that you'd be giving them for their them. and the manager closed the, uh, the register. They went, hold on a second, what is going on here? And they shut the register and they had like this sort of weird eye to eye moment with this guy who was trying to hustle this kid that was working the cash register. It was, it was really fascinating. It was like a guy

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       who was a con man. And I remember I was, um, I was near it. I wasn't involved in leo wasn't, I wasn't working on the cash register, but I was close to it. Forget what I was doing, but I remember watching this going, what's going on? What is something happening here? And then they had like a little meeting. They explained when you're working the cash register, you have to be careful. People that start asking you for weird things, asking you to, you know, because they start twisting your brain and confusing you and your memory gets all fucked up and you're trying to memorize what they're asking for. And before you know it, you've given someone $30 for $20.

Speaker 2:          01:32:32       Yeah. At that, someone did the Iowa. It's a health club quite a few years ago. And I'm like, I came in and he went, it's frankin. It was the owner. I said no. He said all his chain for his wife and mentioned his wife's name. Uh, okay. It's 20 quid. So I went, alright, give them 20 quid. That was it. How many walks out and then front combines, you know, paid for that repair of that bracelet and what you donate. He'd come in a talk to someone at the battery bones. He works at isa bond. Your front was from shorter? no, frank, what's his wife's name? Whatever her name was. And then they said the reception is the money. Anything else? You know, it was done. So mesa, they. So he gave you like a shitty change? Yeah, but I just went over and gave him 20. You know, that's. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       that's a weird hustle, that hustle of trying to confuse people, but there must be patterns that they try to tap into and the way people recognize money or the way people count things as they try to disrupt and cars

Speaker 2:          01:33:38       numbers, words, especially words that can confuse people and send them off guard or we did a thing when we did the masters were neurolinguistic programming and we did a thing called quantum linguistics, which is really interesting. It's really cool. Makes you laugh because it's just makes it doesn't make no sense and one of the best language patterns I was saying. I always, when I was, when I was younger, I was always self sabotaging. I said, hell, we sell sabotage, and a guy called chris mannix did my masters with and I said as much and there's a wasp nest and I've got a stick. Don't go near it because you'll get stung, but because it was your. I always thought, fuck. anyway, he'll get stoned and just see what happens. I'll fight. He's stupid. A young read after anya and he said, what wouldn't happen if it pretended not to do it?

Speaker 2:          01:34:25       So when you said what wouldn't happen if you pretended not to do it right? And I was like whoa. And it just makes sense. Nobody sends your mind in it, especially when you did not. so that wouldn't happen if we pretended not to do it. So if you pretend not to do it. So if you're pretending not to do what you're doing, but what wouldn't happen? Well you wouldn't get stuck. It doesn't happen as you wouldn't get stung. Yeah. But what, what tended not to do it. That's the sort of stone thing in that it's like what would not need

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       to learn how to talk better? Motherfucker. You're talking crazy in that situation where you, when you, when it's dropped on, you know, don't knock on top on the shoulder and say, well we'll never be done in the cliche therapy thing and the therapy situation and it's when it's put into its glided and with language works so smoothly. Do you pay attention at all to cults? Do you pay attention to it? Because I'm fascinated by people's ability to control people, other people's minds, behavior. And I always wondered whether or not like when you see like these, you've seen the scientology documentary going clear. I've started watching it. I started watching. It's fucking fascinating, man. I've, I've watched it three times. I can't look away. I might watch it again. Watch it. It's fucking crazy. I love to watch it. It. Well, I had experience. I have, I've known several people that were scientologists but one of them was one of my neighbors and uh, you know, he and I had some weird exchange about, his wife was going clear, so I needed $50,000.

Speaker 3:          01:36:01       I want 50 fucking grand. Like whoa, what's going on? There was like, they're gonna do some ceremony and his wife will no longer be influenced by outside pressure or outside thoughts or any anybody's criticisms or negativity should no longer. They're no longer affect her. And they needed 50 grand for that. And also what the fight. But he fucking look in his eye. He was telling me like oranges have vitamin c in them, you know, for him it was like pretty straightforward obviously. And I've always been fascinated like what the fuck is going on with my friend named aiden perez? He was into scientology. I'm not really still is. I don't think he is. But he went to pflag, whIch is the base, the base where that at the scientologist half the main place, what they have. And tom cruise's sister is named ada. Sorry, tom cruise's sister's child is named aiden after him.

Speaker 3:          01:36:58       Whoa. So he was into it. I went to it. I went to a couple of times years and years ago and then I creep me out of it. But I don't know if whatever floats your boat, if it's not causing you any, but I haven't seen that government class out welding. So say I agree with that as well. If it's not hurting you and what do I give a fuck? I agree with that as well. Until you start watching these documentaries, you go, well clearly it's hurting some people. It's definitely hurting people. It's breaking up families. It's, it's, it's really fucked up the way they attack some people that, that dissent or that leave or do. I mean, if the people that are on the show, the documentary that are telling if they're telling the truth and that's debatable, you know, uh, own the only thing. No, and the people that they're talking about, no, there's some mind control going on there. There's some, there's some absolute definite mind control going on there. And I wonder, is that related in any way to hypnosis? The, the

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       ability to these people have to manipulate these folks into the hitler speech, mind camp, right? Hitler did, you know, some people maybe a search of for something to be influenced you not so main sewings always going to be a lot easier, you know, so I was going to be that I was going to be susceptible people. There is always going to be susceptible people, but his cult like when you see like a jim jones speech or you know, when, when someone is giving some sort of a cultish speech, is that similar in some ways to resonate? It doesn't resonate with, with the, with the person, with the paypal. Um, I won't say hypnosis, but you'll say us to resonate with what they believe in and you know, they, they, they take floats the boat of gas, you know what I mean? It could again latch on.

Speaker 2:          01:38:46       So it's like cold, cold, cold reading, cold reading, psychics, you know, say stuff like I'm cold reading and halting by no means a different script. Still trying to think, talking about how it's different readings different. I went to a couple of years ago was, you know, it was roads in Greece. Anyway, I digress. And um, we went over and we got stung by the time share people and they deal anyway, no one was going on and on to me and she said, uh, what do you do in english? And I'm a psychic psychic. Oh, right. I said, you ought to know you had an accident near walter, a scam maybe before he was 10. I'm getting 10 for some reason. While he was 10, she went, yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. Yeah, he did. He got a scar on one of your knees? Yeah, I've got a scar on my left knee.

Speaker 2:          01:39:39       I thought. Yeah, I thought you did. Do you know what I mean? And you know, you've been really, you've been, you've had some, you know, you've got some limelight, but you don't mind other people and you've asked a lot of close friends. You've got, you've got a lot of friends. we've only got a certain amount of clothes ones, so everyone resonates with that. Like horoscopes. Everyone saw like clings onto that and you know, this is all sorts of psychics and people say, oh wow, they knew this crazy. Yeah. I have a friend who believes that easily. He went to somebody. He's like, man, they told me all about my grandmother. I'm like, bitch, don't you know about your grandmother telling you some shit you already know. Kind of psychic is that it doesn't make any sense and I never understood it until we had this guy.

Speaker 2:          01:40:22       do you know who bannon check is? Yes. A headband check on the scifi show, joe rogan questions, everything. He was brilliant and stunning and scary. It was scary how good he is at, but also super honest. He said, I'll Tell you right now, I don't. I'm not a psychic, I don't have any psychic ability at all. This is all bullshit and I hate when people steal from people and rob them. What I'm doing is entertainment and it's a show and I have very specific techniques that I use to achieve this. Yeah, that's why I don't. I can't think of anything else. That's why I can't. That's why I don't fuck

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       around when hypnosis and do this. No, no, no. Well, he was not the game is it? He wasn't doing hypnosis. He was just pretending to be able to read your mind and be able to put it. It was all, but he was really, really clear about it. Saying, these are just techniques. I am not really seeing anything that other people can't see. I don't have any special ability, but the people that do claim that like, god, I don't know how it is in england, but in California in particular, you'll drive down the street and you'll see I'll say four or five of these fucking psychic readings kind of baptism that there's loads of chiropractors as well as low. It's an american chiropractic bullshit. Is that what you're saying? Is the chiropractors, and I see that tarot and driving on the street and counterparts, they don't see that many in england.

Speaker 3:          01:41:41       A lot of people think chiropractors are bullshit too. Like a lot of reputable people think it's bullshit, but just moving your neck around and it's like click and killed. Yeah, across a lot of money to go to 150 bucks and then just getting twisted around pop in your back. But then some people say like there's certain things that chiropractors do that really are beneficial. So the fuck. Do you believe? The ones I've. I've been to a couple of times. They would have been here. They've been god's fellow right afterwards where there's this one guy that used to work with a lot of fighters and he was what they call a zone healer and his idea was that he was like sort of tricking your body into healing because he was sort of using the placebo effect, telling you that he was healing you by popping your neck or moving your body in a certain way.

Speaker 3:          01:42:27       But he really wasn't doing anything other than shit of normal chiropractor. I don't know. Try not to pay attention to that shit. That stuff drives me nuts because it's deception and whether or not it's effective or not is debatable because it deception can be effective. Right. And isn't that sort of part of what, you know, what the placebo effects, this is what I'm against in the next thing really is the point was trying to make it. I don't fuck around with people, you know, they come here for help. The genuinely want your help. You genuinely wants to get where they want to get to heaven. You can't fuck around with people. Right. It's not fair. They pay. Yeah. They looking for you to help them out. I both effect because then the chief something together, you know, it's good. I like that there's a lot of these of shit and everything that went through there is more shocking shafts and good ones.

Speaker 3:          01:43:19       You know what I mean? And isn't that. It was also a lot. There's a lot of manipulation and a lot of charlatans and so almost every line of work. Right. But isn't that, it's sort of relative to what we're talking about. It's like what is your focus like? What are you trying to achieve? What are you trying to achieve as a coach, as a coach, you're trying to help people and make them better. What are you trying to achieve as whatever you're doing as a salesperson? Are you trying to sell people something that's an actual great product, like a really nice car, like this is a car. If you enjoy cars, you will enjoy this car is great. Or are you selling them a fucking shit box? it's been taped together and it's going to fall apart the moment they get it out of the driveway.

Speaker 3:          01:44:01       You know, what is your ultimate goal? You're trying to help people. You're trying to have a beneficial mutually agreeable relationship or you're trying to read their poem and get money out of their fucking with them on. I amazing fucking amazing. Like I never, you know that success at joe's hot show shelling and the success that many of my clients have had. I don't go. It was me know because it's all about the client. They do it, I liked the, I liked winning and of course there's some sort of pat on the back for myself by me, but I don't run around like I amazing tile back. Or is it just an appreciation for the method, appreciation of the method and appreciate, you know, it doesn't stop shocking me how well it works at times, you know, above 99 point nine percent of the time. It's just a shock.

Speaker 3:          01:44:53       Even now. Even now that I've been involved in it eight years now, he's just, I don't know, it's just that light bulb goes off that you can sell. It pulls off and stopped around. AbouT how many years have you been doing it full time, full time eight? No, I'm half and half, but training as well. Training fighters. I was, and then I was trying to fight as it got kind of bored of it. I was at the chief what I wanted to fight as it reached a level and I was getting bored and I wasn't giving him the attention I should do, so I decided to stop that and then I had a regular job anyway. And then then I just started to get my coaching and word of mouth, like you got to know me through word of mouth and then it just spread from there and, and it continues to do so still come and say no, I still come and say it as well. I'll come and say for infusion and from yoko, a moitai shells and smash moy tai as well as in england. She's good shows and I still do de gea at gfc and you know, different things like that. But I still call and say it a lot for your car when infusion and it's much more so I just do that as well. But I just, I got a lot of clients from America now. I'm gonna put stupid o'clock in the morning on skype, but it's great. Yeah. Was there an eight hour, 10 hour difference trina?

Speaker 3:          01:46:10       I genuinely bills that. I love the. I like it. Well that's great. I mean that's really what life is all about. Finding something that you really enjoy that you get that buzz off of and pursuing that. And if You can make a living like an assignment. And he can tell you animated by what you do. Well, I'm lucky that I found a bunch of different things that I really enjoyed doing. It just like this, that you could as well. Well there. How about this? The ability or the opportunity rather to have a conversation like this regard. like you sit down for hours totally uninterrupted. It's very rare to get this. It's almost like the only way to get these kinds of conversations is to have this kind of conversation where, you know, it's being broadcast because otherwise we'd be checking our phone. Would it be talking, you know, do you want a beer?

Speaker 3:          01:46:53       Do you want to do this nadar this fucking guy is annoying and this thing is happening to me and I got a part and parcel with that. You wouldn't, you probably wouldn't do that. But you know what I mean, like this is this. The only way you have these intense one on one conversations is in a podcast form. So in a lot of ways this podcast has been incredibly educational. It's been like a, like a, almost like a very varied university course on a bunch of different disciplines and interests. I appreciate it. It's like, you know, you said about Mike Mccullough and the left hook and alIgned, you know, and I went, oh yeah, I forgot about him and like I'm not egotistical enough to think I know everything, you know, you know, don't I seen, like I said, a rapid induction course and the guy was just like, he was doing this hypnosis gun, he's going to sleep and this other guy was good.

Speaker 3:          01:47:44       Right? but isn't that similar like that fucking those bullshit kung fu guys. They're like, students fall to the ground. I can do. Don't you think that's. Is that hypnosis to what is going on with that? It is bullshit, but is it just happening with the student cause this break the students though they're falling to the ground and switching to a. everybody's just daft out. They are, they are they under the hypnosis power of suggestion that maybe it's a suggestion? Well, maybe it's just the, all of that. These. There is a lot of way at people about how idiots and you went to state in the middle of change. The trajectory of the rocket that would have got me in trouble. That is the problem, right? Like some people have big noses and some people are idiots. Some people got gray and some people. Yeah. It's like the genetics very. There's not everybody could be einstein. No, no, no. Some people you go high and they follow the ground.

Speaker 3:          01:48:46       I've, I've seen some videos of fake kung fu and it's fucking amazing. Like there's this one dude and he was teaching this class and he had this, this girl and he was moving her back and forth and back and forth like, like, like a comedy. Like it was a comedy but it was real and, and he, you know, he'd make her dance and shock her and then she would fall to the ground and she was one. Now that guY gets his students like a big bellied guy gay on. And then she does this, gave him an oscar. That was a right performance. And seniors like flops on the deck and he's our flu. Indiana was propofol naming because I'm here at the moment in America. We, Jordan Watson, who's a, like super tight and we was watching it. He was pacing ourselves often is phoning. Well, there's a lot of that out there, man. There's a lot of that fake kung fu stuff out there. Less and less now than there was in 1993 when the ufc came along. That's one of the things that the ufc has done that's amazing, is eradicate a of the bullshit martial

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       arts. There's a lot of fake practitioners out there. And you know, eddie bravo has this hilarious story of this fake kung fu teacher that he was taking lessons under. you know, he's a young kid. He didn't know any better. And uh, the guy was going to China to study under his master and he rang, eddy, ran into them at the supermarket when the guy was supposed to be in China to fuck. And they didn't realize that isn't taking conch food. Just making shit up. Like everything he was doing was just totally made up. Karate chop of people on top of the head and saying you'd kill them if you hit them correctly, but it's that, that sort of make dojo type fake martial arts stuff was really, really, really prevalent a few decades ago if I grew up with drunken master there and all of them in all the, uh, run run, shaw, mavis, you know, golden harvest.

Speaker 1:          01:50:41       Well those are fun to watch, to pretend you know, you watched an old jackie chan movie and it's fucking crazy shit. But the chunk of masters, that one. Yeah, I was beating them over. See, it's out some seed. It's funny comedy though. It seems funny. Yeah. But it's still, it's still, uh, still there. and I tell you, I really liked police story with jackie chan. The first one. That was good. That was wicked. That was, he managed jackie shanghainese. But a lot of those movies had people believe in it. There were people out there that had ci and depth touch and try, you know, when, when you want. I just, I mean, to bring it back to what you do. Do you, do you think there's any of that? That's hypnosis. Is there anything that's similar to what I said Frank Santos used to be able to do?

Speaker 2:          01:51:27       Um, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:51:30       Is it the only slide? I don't know. Devotion that they have towards their sensei or there? There's, yeah, it's bananas. Honestly. It's crazy. They believe what he says. So he's like, oh yay, you can do this and, but how is that different than a guy who thinks like, I watched a guy who thought he was having sex with madonna and he came in his pants because Frank Santos put that in his head and he did that. I wAtched it and the guy was like, he didn't know. He came in and I mean this guy wasn't that good of an actor. He just wasn't. He was embarrassed. You know what to do. Hey, kinda like slumped over and sat and acquaint. If he was, if he was a ham, he would have spent. It just was, you could tell this guy really bad it

Speaker 2:          01:52:10       at that particular time where he was at that particular in that particular place. He did believe it. I mean, you've seen people with needles when they need, you know, they have a needle and they don't feel the pain you can do, you can do that. And there's an interesting one called pain paradigm, which I'll talk to you about another time on, um, anticipation next week it was. And um, you know, I mean just at least there's all sorts of things that we, who knows what the mindscape we'd only just now I'm only a postman of information.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       Rarely, I mean, what really can meet it, what will he develop it. That's an interesting way to describe it. A posted minimum from asphalt. Keith miami, first teacher said we just posted one of information. I like that. Yeah. Um, I, I just, I'm really fascinated by the, the full spectrum, for lack of a better term of possibilities of suggestion that you can go from, you know, fake psychics and fake healers. And like my friend Brian and I were the comedy store last night. Did you see that? Were you there when you saw the woman was trying to do the reiki healing on us? It was hilarious because I knew I was going to talk to you today and I knew she was full of shit. She probably thinks it's real, but she was like, can you feel the energy? I'm like raving. Like she said, put your, put your left hand out. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:53:36       left hands are more sensitive, more susceptible or. Okay. So I had my hand out and she is like running her hand over the top and the bottom line. Not touching my hand, but getting close to it like, do you feel it? Do you feel anything? And I'm like, nope, I'm trying. I'm trying to be open minded but I don't feel anything. But some people would be like, yes, I do feel it. I think it's what you want to believe. My believes like, like people that say kicks nico to cds, tarot card readers, etc. If they give people comfort, I make some people feel better and you know, right. Got more power to him. Right. More power to them. They believe at the time if they believe that there's this reiki, and then if they believe it and it works and people are happy doing it and we might meet, might go, well, it's, where's the line drawn?

Speaker 3:          01:54:24       Is the line drawn when you're taking money from them? There is pissed take isn't the world. And they piss take piss takers. What does, um, you know, taking the piss. Well, okay, you guys are fucking with somebody taking the piss. Yeah. But um, but more so than that, someone who is pretending to be healing, but they're stealing money from you. They're not really healing you nice. But it's like anyone that sells a vitamin that have this snake oil, snake oil, yeah, snake all take this and you'll definitely changed. But what about fucking the real placebo effect? That's where it gets really weird because like there are some placebos they have introduced to people and they've told them it's a placebo and then the, but the act of doing something, the act of taking something actually has a more beneficial effect than not doing anything. Which is again, the power of the mind, like the placebo effect is a real effect. You give someone something, you tell them this is medicine, this is going to fix whatever ails you. And it actually does work on a certain percentage, a statistically significant percentage of the people that are like crystals and shit was like a lot of people believe in. They pull up with around and they were getting good

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       luck. Good luck coin. Yeah. I've got my lucky quarter dumbo, isn't it? You know, the, the, the, a feather. Lucky further, you know, and he believes he can fly with it. They're lucky feather. It comes down to how the rest, um, yeah, he sold it, I think sold down to your business all down of what you put into your intention and what you want to belief for yourself. You know, isn't it

Speaker 1:          01:56:03       weird that we have these minds that have such amazing potential, but there's no fucking real good guidebook that anybody's handed and you're sort of supposed to figure it out on your own or based on if you're lucky. You have parents that have their shit together and they sort of give you a rough outline of how you should live your life or live by example, but we're not talking about like goldfish or swans or anything fucking simple. We're talking about human beings with complex languages in mathematics and culture and society and laws and and, and money and all of the weirdness that comes with being a person in it. Good. Though it is

Speaker 2:          01:56:43       select site in. Well that is six assignment from a bloodline of merlin and sherlock. Yes, and melon homes. Real estate. But that's. I just liked that. I didn't, I just, I liked the, I liked the mystery. I do too because you can see. You're probably saying, well, I like that. It's interesting and that's what keeps you, keeps you going in life. I think when you find something interesting and yet you're trying to, you know, it's always better to be interested, interested instead of interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:57:13       Oh yeah, no, for sure. I mean that's one of the things that I appreciate most about being able to do this podcast is that I'm constantly and consistently inspired and curious. I'm always learning like this use, you can't know everything. It is not possible. There's too much going on and once you accept that, then you just looking for stuff that you find stimulating and then find more and more things that you find fascinating and this podcast has given me this really unique opportunity to talk to people like you or know anybody who has some information that I'm not really aware of.

Speaker 2:          01:57:46       Pro. Massively honored to be on air because you know, I'm from. I'm from liverpool, I'm from newton. Yeah, I know, but you know, I'm just like, yeah, but you, nobody's going in there. And then joe says so nice things in. Mccall says nice things and I get to do seminars and get to meet people and I love it. I'm just bold enough about them.

Speaker 1:          01:58:04       well that's what life is all about, really is finding something like that that you really enjoy doing and then pursuing it and then if you can, god, if you can make a living doing that, what a, what a great way to be, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:58:15       Yeah. I like people. I like, you know, I like people like I don't like everyone on as a client because some people just think. No, no.

Speaker 1:          01:58:25       Have you had like people that are like shitty or just not appreciative, kind of suss them out quickly? Do you try to explain to them why you're not doing this and maybe give them like some

Speaker 2:          01:58:36       uh, yeah, I hope future. Yeah. I just, yeah, I just say well I can't. Or embassy or just the normal stuff and you know, it depends on what it is. It's not often. I'll be honest with you. It's not often that happens, but um, yeah, it does happen. I just handed her the, you know, these one guy saying it was one guy recently. He's like, yeah, everyone in my team thinks I'm rubbish. I can't fight and I can't talk to you now. My wife's in bed and just like, oh, that don't know. Right. You know, just loads of things you have to stop. No, that's too much work. Like if you can't see what she has salt, no sovereignty. I see much hustle. Yeah. But like on the docks triumphant, I like that everyone had a gym. I know people that went didn't win fights on the door jams and they went under me. I like, ah, casey, she's good. So then I would just give them that boston, you feel good about it, you sort of thing. Yes, I've achieved something that other people didn't like that. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:59:39       Yeah. The ability to help people. And the, the satisfaction that comes from other people benefiting from your efforts? Yeah. Is a very nice thing.

Speaker 2:          01:59:48       A light. It's in a question lady called donna tainter at the minute. She's soft got where she is somewhere in the states and she's, they rarely. Well it's just a transformation has been incredible. And she's, you know, all the students are so much better to have sponsors like really warm inserters you ride in better and stuff like that. And he's just moving things out of people's way is kicking out.

The reason why it's called shelter, I'm it's not perverted in 69 shell time as I used to be a comment say for 16 hours. The arrows bond. Oh no, that's a problem, right? Isn't it? That number. So it's gonna have to change that. I think a lot of great cars. Nineteen 69. We landed on the moon

Speaker 2:          02:00:38       and you can get me on vinny shoreman.com and also you can get me on facebook. There's a, there's a facebook or mind coaching page where there is techniques and videos, a withdrawal techniques and all sorts.
