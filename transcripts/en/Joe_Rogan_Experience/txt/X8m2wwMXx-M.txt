Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Or live Neil Brennan in the middle of tweeting. What are you doing? I'm using my Samsung Galaxy right now. Says a beautiful phone. Hi. To me. Your voice is so commercial. Thanks very much. You were on stage the other night and the belly room and we were in the green room. We're like, his voice is so commercial. Like it sounds like that God damn car. So I'll never be able to separate them. Now I know I shouldn't say that commercial. Just say that series of commercials. How many of those fucking things you'd done? I, you know what? I don't know. Probably 30. I just do sessions and then they do whatever they want. We should do other shit man. If you were just doing that and then you became the verizon guy, you know. Can you hear me now? Like that guy. That guy's fucked. Fuck fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       You're getting a dell. Oh that guy's fucked. How about the girl? The insurance girl. It's always know. Is that a name? Yeah, but they. At least they keep making those. She is fucked once she's done though, but she's probably made a killing by this point. Hopefully, but is it worth it? The first one, but that guy from that fucking commercial that always gets in the accidents and falls down and gets hurt, you know that a handsome gentleman, he, they cast him in a lot of shit. He's in movies too. He's always in movies. He was in John Wick. He's been. John Wick was good, right? Fuck yeah. What I've heard, it's good. I just haven't watched it. I mean it's no like brilliant, like super creative, undeniable work of art. But it's funny shit as far as like a really wild, crazy entertainment. It's just, it's like crazy action sequence.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       The craziest is the guy who directed it was a fight coordinator apparently, so he just had ideas for like the ideas he'd never given people I think. Oh. And so he was like, eh. So we just saved it. He needs a sandbag. He must have worked for and then and then unleashed. It does not work with writers like you're a writer. Doesn't that work with writers sometimes, like if you see like, like specific writers are writing for someone else, like a monologue or something like that. I know what you're getting at. No, I mean like, look, I don't. There are certain jokes that like if I'm writing for like rock or something, it's usually for like the bet awards, so it's not like a. It would have done that in my. I would have done that topical joke about usher in my. The thing about monologues, it's like pretty disposable, but yeah, I know I every now and then people on snl that sucked as writers and then they became cast members and all of a sudden I hit a lot of good ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       They just store them all like squirrels. Yeah. Just like totally sandbag because comics are like inherently kind of self obsessed, you know, and the idea of like writing selflessly for someone else and making them much better. I was talking to somebody about this yesterday, the fact that we, it's an accepted thing in comedy that it's just the accepted caste system that rock is basically saying like, Hey, I'm funnier than you and I'm hosting shelves. So fucking Gimme jokes it based on what the world saying. I don't, I don't think it's that explicit. There is at the same time, there's something flattering about the fact that like, one of the best comics wants me to run, but it's a great um, but there's also something about like, you come here, rub my back, hey other MMA fighter, come rub my back, this fight. I'm ranked higher than you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       So come around. My bug was just like, okay, you can pay and all that stuff. Think of it that way at all. I think of it as, first of all, honestly, I don't either. I know you don't. It's very intelligent for him because it's the smart way to do it in a lot of people don't do it that way. They don't bring in other people to help them and they're, they're working kind of suffer, you know, like he's pretty smart in that way that he's like looking at objects that there's other strong people around. If I bring them in, it'll make my already strong act. Even do it for his act. He'll do it for a TV show monologue. And uh, and so it's not. And the other thing with rock is it's generally you write stuff for him. And sent it to him so that he can be confident in his shit.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Be like, okay, my shit's better than this. Like fun. Well you just need like a giant mound of shit to chop away at. And then you find where the gems are. If you only have like a few, like pretty decent ideas and you're trying to build them up, that's way, way less effective than an enormous catalog of ideas need to turn to present x ones. Yeah. That's a rock. Always says, uh, he's like, I like, I, I have comedy writers around the way rappers have gold chains. Like that's all he spent his money on. You know what I mean? Like if he's gonna, he's not gonna, he's not gonna buy a chain. He's like, I'll just have a writer write for fucking a movie with Marisa. That's smart. Yeah. Well that's why he's Chris Rock. He's got a, you know, as effective strategy for optimizing all of his shows and all of the sets and all, you know, he's, he knows the fee on the thing that I was.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       When you were saying about having other people come in. Look, I find that a lot of guys, comedian wise, when you get to the theater level, um, it's basically all your audiences are henpecked. All of your audiences are predisposed to like you. Do you ever scan? What I found is a lot of people when they go to theaters, they're acting, they're plateaus or gets worse. Do you find, do you ever specifically go to rooms where they don't know you're coming to get a better read on shit? Yeah. Well, I do a lot of sets during the day, like regular sets at the Improv or the store where they're there to see, have a wide variety of people. I do a lot of those. I think those are important, I think sets at the store important period because it's a fucking jaded group down there. It's beautiful and magical, but it's jaded. Yeah. It's the hardest thing in the world. Belly Room. Yeah. You might as well be doing standup for one person. One hundred percent. People are right in front of the. The worst part of the belly room is there's people to the right that could just charge the stage right there. Fucking it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       Yeah. Well it's also, they have. It's great though, like what we're all were saying about the thing, like the worst part of it, but even the worst part about it is magic because that room is fucking magic, man. That belly room, if you get something to work and that belly room. We were talking about this last night, that there's the belly room and the Ice House and the Ice House is maybe the best club ever. It's got the rep and having done it, it's like the easiest, easiest. Yeah. Yeah. Well let's just set up. Perfect. Yeah. The ceiling is low. Everyone's stuffed in there. It's very contagious. Laughter is great. Acoustics saw wood everywhere. The laughter really reverberates and it's got whatever the fuck. Fifty years of comedy burned into the walls. It's the oldest club in the country. I think it's older than 50 years old, isn't it? I think that. I think it's. I think it is. I think it's like 55 years old or something like that, but it's the irl. It's essentially the oldest comedy club on Earth because the oldest clubs for comedy, we're in America, so the oldest one in America, so it's the oldest, longest running club ever, so it's super rare place, but it's way easier than like the Olr or especially the belly room. Different kind of Louis say in

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       an interview, like when he does, when he's in La, he'll go, he'll do like an alternative show. Then he'll do the Improv or the laugh factory and then he'll do the store and it's like if it works, he's like, everything will work on alternative room. Some stuff will work at the Improv and one thing will work at the store and the one thing that works with the store that keeps. That's smart. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       So you need all of those. Because when I was just doing the store only, I think my ax suffered a little bit. I think where does it go? Because that's the thing. It's hard to

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       the psychographic of the story. You think they [inaudible] I still couldn't tell you. Having been working there six, seven years, I still couldn't tell you like the psychology of that kind of part of the. Of the average of the audience's collective unconscious.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       Well, first of all, let me just say this. It's way better now. The second, my second run of the store from 2007 on. I wasn't there, so I started up again December 14. It's way better. It's just better. It's a better club. The young guys coming up are better. There's a better vibe. The audiences are better. Yeah. When I was there in the, in the early two thousands, man, I was a war zone. It was all old. It was all old timers, right? I mean it was a lot of world, but it was also. The audience was just like monsters. There was a lot of months like rapey dm hat, goalie, drunky. No crowd control at all. They have real crowd control now. They'll kick people out if they're retarded. Yeah. They didn't use to do that. They'll kick people out. If they say eight things you have to say.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       You have to say, fuck it. Ate any of these gloves like, no, we're good. It's fucking get them out. They're not going to. If they say more than one thing, get them out. They kicked the guy out at the ice house last night and he like early on this one bit, he would cap yelling the same thing out while the bit was going on and I figured, let me know Oregon. Yeah, we got to the end of the bay and he's still yelling out the thing. I'm like, I heard you. You Fuck? And he's like, well no, I was talking about the thing on your part because we're not having a conversation is a fucking show. Did he? Keeps going. I'm like, Oh fucking Christ. And then when the bouncers come over to take him away, he goes, are you serious? I was helping. What do you think? They just picked you. They just randomly picked. The guy decided to fuck with them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       That's what I said the other day to a woman who was yelling. I go, you go to fucking Katy Perry concert, sit at the bar at the bottom of the stage and just sing along with her. Shut the fuck up. Like I don't need your help. They didn't book the show and go those four guys and then hopefully someone will come and heckle them. Yeah, but a Katy Perry concert, if you go and sit there and sing along with her, it's probably flatter area. Yeah, but if you're trying to, if you're, if you're at the foot of the stage doing it, it's probably the worst would be if you were saying don't sing that song precise. Don't you have another song? Which mayor was telling me the name drop a was saying that the biggest issue at his shows now girls running to the foot of the stage, turning their back to them and taking a selfie. Oh no, he's at. If he has security to like stop it. It's like if I didn't stop it, there'd be hundreds of people every year and it's hugely distracting because there's a thing starting at the thing you're looking at.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       Yeah. Well, don't you find distracting when you look out into the crowd and you see like 10 phones up, take the photos of you or taking a selfie or taking picture with Neil Brune. She'll kill it at Hashtag. Hashtag winning. Hashtag tiger blood. I mean there's so many people want to take pictures now that Hannibal burress did some weird thing at one of his shows where they have some new technology. It's like a pouch and they give you this pouch, close it. And when you're inside the club the pouch doesn't open so you can't get to your phone. So if your phone rings, if you feel like you must answer it, you have to leave the venue and then the patch will open. I guess it works on some sort of like a frequency if you're past like one of those electronic dog collars, you know those things.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       So it's something like that. But man, the reaction to it was like, fuck you. I was reading all the reaction, although I tweeted it. Yeah. You know, because I saw the store. I'm like, hmm, this is kind of interesting. I wonder how people feel about this. Not that I would implement it, I just, I feel like the streisand effect is in effect the streisand effect. You know, the, the Barbara Streisand, they found her house and they put her house online like they, you know, like someone took a photo of it and like this is where Barbara streisand's houses. And so she, you know, was offended. She made this big deal and she's like, fuck you take my house down, this and that. And because she put so much effort into fighting the fact that our house was down way more people knew about her house and they all attacked and went after her. I think if you tell people she can't bring your cell phone to my show,

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       then they start wearing. Yeah, they put a Gopro on, are they, you know, they, they'll film from a fucking one of those glasses that has the lens in the sense you had that at the tail down. I had a guy google glasses, uh, google the laugh factory. And I go, dude, I can't fucking. Yeah. I don't know if you're taping right? So you're just being a dick because I, you know, I'm, it's all I can think about now is this fucking dude with the visor in my peripheral vision and he might be, he could be fucking periscoping it now can use periscope from Google. I think Google last might even be dead. Do periscope the show. I do periscope things, but no, not to show. How come you want to. Where I want to tweet about this by the way. Where should people go? The show? I already tweeted it out. Just go to mine and retweet. If you need to write you a bit addicted to the. No, hold on. Let me put that fucker and get it over with Joseph Justa. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got it. I got you are. You are a commercial actor. I know for a cell phone company and you're addicted to cell phones. Snake is interesting. Eating the tail on around. You need. Alright, great. Why aren't you periscoping?

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       Alright, I'll put you. Pushed it away. I love it. I love it. It's out of range. He's a haunting you right now. That's out of range now. Sometimes it haunts me. I put my phone over there, but, but if there's something important happening right now in the world of Van to four wheel drive, conversions are the, uh, the cell phone thing. Someone was telling me when you go again and I don't. This isn't my name. Drop when you go to drake's house. When girls come over [inaudible] he makes everyone turned their cell phones. It really? Yeah. Smart. Yeah. Because they kind of want to take a picture of course. Um, yeah. And it's just like, no, you can't do it. So he makes him like put it in a bucket or something. I don't. Yeah. I don't know the specifics of it, but it's good move. Yeah. Shovel Vault smart. Safe. Put your phone. That is what is. Why is the table in the vault? That's where your phone goes. What? Everybody puts her phone and want to say you want to say yes.

Speaker 4:          00:14:02       No, no phones. No phones baby. Um, yeah. How are we going to take selfie? Drake, drake. I got it baby. I got it. Well, you have to have, if you're like one of those big time baller rapper characters and trying to keep everything on the dl or at least keep as much of your private life private as possible. You've got to take like some serious precautionary steps. Yeah, I've heard of guys like having prenups are not prenups, but nondisclosure. Nondisclosure. Oh yeah. Every. I mean not everybody, but like that's a common thing. Like I've done things where like you can't even be in the bedroom with the person until you've signed an NDA. Wow. Yeah. Well if you're worried about a fake rape accusation, that's the way to deal with it. One hundred percent. But then the girl could say, well, I was

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       thinking we're going to make out and as soon as I signed it, he just started raping. Yeah. Yeah. And then it's like, well, yeah, but you said you wouldn't say, well look here today I'm going to tough spot. Because you said, yeah, you just, I think they assume like once I sign this, you're not, like all bets are off, but I think they just assume. I don't know man. I would think that, yeah, I guess if you're Michael Jordan though. Yeah. What do you do? You know what I mean? Like what do you. You have to. Well those guys, when you're worth as much money as a guy like Michael Jordan, you become not just a human being, but an opportunity. Yeah. Like a multinational corporation. Yeah. Walking around and appealing the slip and fall accidents and charge you with it. Oh, absolutely. Completely. One hundred percent. Right. You've got to think that that is a.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       he's a target in that sense. Whereas if you're worth that kind of money, people look at you and they go, look, if I sue this motherfucker for $100,000,000, if things go badly, I got five. Yeah. I mean like you only give me half a million dollars just to shut the fuck up and then boom, you're out the door with a half a million bucks and you know, nothing really even happened to you and there's a bunch of people that do that over and over and over, over and over. Jordan probably get sued everyday. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Between the corporation and the, just every like there's. Yeah. Wow. Not fucked. Yeah. I was reading about this one guy who was involved. I forget what the case, but um, it turned out that he had sued like dozens and dozens of people for like he's a professional lawsuit litigate or, or a lawsuit claiming.

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       Yeah, whatever the fuck it is. Some shit and this guy just does that. It goes from one to the next tries to figure out how to make some money and then susie this guy and then Suzanne guy for fraud and this guy for front, like, you know, that's a creepy, creepy abuse. There's a music company like that that just will go after the slightest infraction real. And they, they, they're, they're like, they're known in the music industry. They will sue you. It's like commodore music or some shit and they'll just go after fucking the slightest. It kind of sounds like this, that in and it holds people up and people to settle. Well every now and then when one does get through, like that song that was like blurred lines. Yeah. Well Marvin Gaye. Yeah, I mean that is exactly like, how the fuck did they not know that people are going to see that?

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       I think there's so much copying and the music business that I think they were just like, it's just kind of like somewhat sounds, just like fucking that song, you know, what I was listening to, there was a, I was listening to a podcast, the camera, what it was they would, but they were playing Bob Dylan songs that were stolen that, that deal install wives because he was doing all folk songs so it was all sort of public domain, but he was taking other people's melodies and then making them, changing the lyrics and those became hits for him. Yeah, it was, I was, blew my mind because you've got bob bill involve people. It's like the, you know, the poet laureate of the fucking the most, etc. Yeah. Just as much as anYbody else. Yeah. George harrison got sued for um, two different songs was my avatar was not one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:18:11       Uh, if they were both hits, one was like, I'd like to teach the world to sing. I think he did it one that I think coke did it before him and then he did something that sounded like and lost that I believe I could be wrong, but I like to buy the world a coke. Yeah. That was before. I'd like to teach the world to say no. I, uh, no. It's the same song. Oh, I don't know what george harrison's was, but I know that he lost two lawsuits, but to thin lines one after all the different lawsuits and all the different people that have been sued for stealing lines in, in songs or stealing melodies, you would think that they wouldn't think that they could pull that off. Yeah. I was surprised that one, to be honest with you, because. Yeah, I was surprised that one because it's.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       You could make a case. It's different enough. Really. Okay. It's not the same. It's not the same tempo. Oh, okay. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. Need listen to it. I know they did another one. They tried to go after him for another marvin gaye song. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That one's like much more shaky than this one, but for ells, a creative guy, so it's not like they're dealing with some hack and he wrote the whole thing. Is it possible to frozen a little bit of a hack a look? Anything's possible. Anything is anything. I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, he's a. I'm sure everyone's a little bit of a hack I guess, but like bob dylan's, a little bit of a hack. Precisely. None of us are safe. None of us are safe. If bill cosby's raping, what chance did the rest of us have?

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       Does that the biggest shock that you've ever heard in all my years of. No. You know why? Because I met him 20 years ago and he was a fucking dick and when his show started the sitcom, I was like, I don't like that guy. Really. I promise you. As a 10 year old, I was like, I don't like that guy. It's Just a fucking ego maniac. I knew it from the mit. I mean, I'm rarely that write about something. Rarely do I not like someone and they turn out to be like a serial rapist, but usually you're just kind of a dick, but to become a c, I was like, yeah, that totally makes sense for you. Ever made it, met him. You had this, you had, you'd made them? Yeah. Figured it out. Didn't like, didn't never liked the sitcom. Thought i was crazy. Really?

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       Yeah. When I went to college, nyu, there was an essay in some english lit book, say explaining what the formula for the show was, which was um, the kids have an original idea, a, an original design and original idea. And then bill cosby spends the episode chopping them down and it was like, yeah, that's exactly what every episode was. And I hated it just as a kid. I'm like, fuck this guY, fuck them. Let them have a bug and lead to let a ruby or whatever the rudy, have a fucking let her get a pet or whatever. Whatever she wanted. So you met him? Yeah. And how lonG after you saw the show did you meet him? I met him in 1993 at, uh, the arsenio hall show, the original. Really? YeaH. and so this would, do we know each other then? Yeah, it was after.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       I mean, we hadn't seen it but it was like after I was a doorman down here and went to and met the woman who works at the arcenio and through dave and whatever. So she was like, and whenever there's somebody cool launch, it's like come and meet someone. So met him and he was talking about slavery and he was like, it was me, him and two black dudes and he goes, he, he because he goes. And then the dutch man came and pointed at me and I was like, I'm not dutch, but he was like, you know, close enough. But the fact that he would point them in because we're not, you know, I'm not, what are the odds? I'm fucking dutch. And the fact that he just pointed at me and was any. He's a predator like wildly smug guy. Wildly smug. Yeah. Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       I'm like, you know, smart guy. But not as. He's one of those guys will talk and then say in other words, four times. It's like, no, you're making the same point for them. Like I got it the first time. Right. To impress themselves. Yeah. In my experience. Yeah. Yeah. Smart. Like really smart people at god damn it. w w, what are we doing here with wrestling? And we having a conversation like, what are we doing? Well they're not, you're not there. Yeah, you don't. It doesn't matter who they're talking to. You're just a warm. You're just like, uh, if they're the predator, you're just like fucking red. Like you're just a thing that they're talking at. Yeah. And the heat signature. Yeah. You're, you're a walking heats so they just fucking die. I. Well that to me was the only thing that made sense about this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       It's like how could someone drugs, somebody like that. And I've thought about and I was like, I bet if you have lived decade after decade of people just kissing her ass and everyone around you is like some weird form of a yes man. Like you have a whole industry behind you. Like, but he's on the show, like think about he has all the production assistants and the producers and the executive producers and the cameraman and the sound guys and the makeup people and everyone is just, yeah, mr cosby and that's your existence and you get onstage in front of that crowd and you're making this show and he's american killer comedian. He's a fUcking killer. I don't like the guy. And I'm saying he's, he's a killer. And think that you just developed this sort of like really distorted, psychotic view

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       of yourself in relationship to the rest of the world?

Speaker 3:          00:23:49       I don't think so because he's the first famous person that's, I think he had the pathology before. He was famous. the idea that I've never heard of a famous person like, oh yeah, so my shit now is I got to the drug bitches in and rape them when they're asleep level. Like that's not a level that's not like a known itself. So I think it was the thing that he had a. In some ways I don't feel bad for them, but what do you do you know, any sexual desire you have, you're eventually going to do. You can quell it for four nights. So you say like if you have that, what do you do? Kind of creepy. Like there was a this american life about a guy who was a pedophile. He was 19, he was a pedophile. One of the had sexual feelings for like 10, 12 year old boys hadn't acted on It and it's like, what do I do? Jesus christ. What do you do? That's why when people go so and so like prostitutes, whatever. It's like a transvestite, whatever. It's like poor him. Like in some ways it's like you're gonna your dick makes you do awful shit. So I believe he had that before. Before he was famous or anything I was. I don't think it's. Yeah, I wonder if that part is

Speaker 2:          00:25:06       that this was a more commonly accepted practice because he had a bit that he used to do about.

Speaker 3:          00:25:13       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       I wonder if like people didn't think that it was that big of a deal or as big of a deal as they think of now, like maybe people didn't think of hitting someone with a mickey that's called. They had a cute lIttle name for it. Whereas now it's like drug raids.

Speaker 3:          00:25:29       Yeah. You know? Yeah. To me that spanish fly argument was a. That just sounded like one of those, remember back in the day, but it's like remember speaking spell. It's like one of those bits for regeneration. Um, but yeah, I think it was way more like there was, I was reading about the, one of the girls who lived at hugh hefner's house and he offered her a loot and saId back in the old days they used to call these lego openers or thigh openers. And it's just like, I believe it. I believe that they use vitamins. Yeah. It's like, yeah, women even 30 years ago didn't have a lot of rights, like sexual harassment. I don't think the first sexual harassment suit was tilt if I'm at the earliest. It was the late seventies.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       It's amazing how much things have changed. And how quickly things have changed, we were reading yesterday on the podcast was yesterday, day before yesterday, this speech by lincoln when he was debating like 18, 58 to be debating the rights of black people. And even lincoln back then was saying that he didn't think that they should be allowed to serve on juries or vote or even intermarry with whites. And it was like, whoa, like that's not that long ago.

Speaker 3:          00:26:40       I thought that there were four fifths of a person. Like you're

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       not, you're not, you're not three fifths, but you're not fun either. And you know, the argument is, well listen, you have to put it into context like his time during his time, this was revolutionary. That was progressive, who's incredibly progressive. Yeah. It's not that long ago, man, so long ago at all. That's done even 200 years ago. What's cool is that peer that we're living in now as you can get rights. I mean this shit is like the gay rights movement and the trans, right? I mean that. I've never seen a movement like this. Them get traction writes things amazing. Yeah. They're starting to get gay marriage all over the country. It's like popping up pop, pop, pop. It's, it's a cause. It was stupid anyway, but first of all, let's be honest. Marriage is pretty fucking stupid. Retarded. This is coming from a married person.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       Yeah. The idea of like you're going to sign a contract. Some of based on romance. Yeah. like, you know, I get it, I get that you'd want, you'd want some sort of security, but if you're gay and you can't even make. People can't even get pregnant unless you guys figure out how to eat. You have to get a surrogate or you're talkIng about, you know, maybe friends that are also lesbians that want a kid. And like I'll tell you will have two kIds. You give me one and ultimately with the how do you work it out, but they're going to be your kids. But yeah. But that wasn't about that. It was about like you also couldn't visit. You're over the hump so you couldn't, you couldn't get insurance rights, all that stuff. No. Look, even if you don't want to get married, it's a, it's a quality.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       You know you want to be able to do, you don't want to fucking law that says you can't imagine. Can't marry another man that he loves. That's gross and stupid and the fact that that was common until really recently and the argument, because it aIn't writing well, that's not a fucking art. It ain't right. It's not a legal argument. Still been going on today. These guys that are running for republican office, it's still happening today. You know what I mean? Rick santorum was just talking about it recently. All these fucking dummies. what does that guy. I'm ted cruz. That fucking dumb. He doesn't believe in it. I'm just going to lose like you fucking dumb ass. There's enough people that that cleaned to that stupidity that are still on their side for now. They're like the last fucking confederate flag holdouts and is it is there or is there not something in the bible about it because I've heard some men are not supposed to lie down with men and it's an abomination.

Speaker 2:          00:29:05       That's what it saYs, but it says who you're dealing with. MulTiple translations was to go, yeah. Well, not only that, there's more than 2000 years ago, the oldest versions of the bible that we know of today are the dead sea scrolls and the dead sea scrolls, the only bible, only version of the bible that's an aramaic, and when they try to translate it, like if the stories are similar but different, so all sorts of wacky shit in the dead sea scrolls that isn't in any of the other books. I knew the religious texts and then you go to the oldest versions of the bible is all in ancient hebrew. Little fuck speaks ancient hebrew. You've got to translate that to latin and they translated that to greek and a lot of shit gets missing in the process. When they wrote ancient hebrew to ancient hebrew letters and numbers were interchangeable, like words had numerical value to them, like there was no number.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       So the letter a was also the number one. Yeah, so it's just such a different context is different. There's a different meaning to everything they were saying like the word god and the word love. They have the same numerical value and numerical values are actually important in the. When you're saying a sentence, you know, you say a sentence, there's tone, there's sarcasm there so you can see things in it. That's why textIng is hard to exactly. Are you mad at me like no man, we were fucking around. You know, sometimes people don't know I'm mad at you, but in, in ancient hebrew apparently it's hard for us to put it in perspective and kind of understand the way they communicated, but when they wrote things down, there was inherent new miracle quality to the census. They had lIke a, some, it was worth the sentence, had numbers to it and I don't think we're.

Speaker 2:          00:30:48       There are 50 arguments against why the bible is real and there's one pro argument which is I like it. It makes me feel good. That's the only argument you can give. Well, the idea that gOd would write one book a long time ago to one dude and then go off to manage grasshopper populations and make sure her gains happen. Like, where have you been man? How come you don't tell us agaIn? don't you understand there's 30 different versions of this? Wouldn't you want to carry it up? Yeah, you're a dick at this point. Like if you made a quote like if you, if there was a controversial issue that came up, you know, and you made a quote and then a bunch of people took that quote and butchered it and twisted it up 15 different ways to sunday and you are aware of it, wouldn't you want to correct that when you want to come back and Go, whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't see you have to eat babies that are the color of orange.

Speaker 2:          00:31:40       THat is not what I said. Like you guys are. You guys fucked the whole thing up. Yeah. But not this god guy. Yeah. He's like, I told you. Yeah, I told you. Yeah. I told you once I'm not and I'm not going to tell you again. What did all these people that are lying about what you said? You got to figure out. It's not my fault. Not my problem. It's not my game, bro. Yeah. No. Yeah, it's a. There's so you believe in a god. I don't not believe, you know, I think it would be super arrogant to say, I don't believe in god. I've seen so many things on psychedelic drugs that don't make any sense at all. Then I'm like, how? Why would I ever be so cocky as to think that I have the whole framework of the universe spelled out? It's purely speculation.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       Even for scientists like for scientists and scientists are studying the very nature of matter itself down to subatomic particles and quasars and supernovas and gas clouds and all these different things that they're studying. At the end of the day, all they are really, truly aware of is what they can perceive their own senses in this existence. They don't know what happens when you die. They don't know if it's just a gateway to another new completely different kind of experience. They don't know, and the idea that it's not that it's just death and it's black and darkness. well, where did you come from in the first place? Why are you even here? Why are you even here as a conscious entity? Like why is the idea of you, you thinking about you? that is a real thing, like what purpose does it serve and why is it, why does it exist and is it possible that this whole thing is just a long process, sort of like a seed goes into the ground, water gets on that seed, this seed sprouts pops through the ground becomes a tree, the tree gives fruit, the fruit drops, fruit that fruit goes into the ground, becomes new trees.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       Animals eat those treats or nutrients for the next generation part of this weird, crazy ecosystem and the ecosystem that has that has created a human being with all their creativity and self awareness and all their ability to reflect and change and this crazy desire for innovation like to have the newest, greatest shit. The biggest, coolest thing, the fastest thing, the smartest thing, the most advanced thing. We're constantly searching for this newer, better product. It would seem to me that all of that is a part of some almost inescapable process of change, change and improvement and change. It seems like the whole thing is always changing, right? Like a cloud forms or rather a planet forms out of clouds and dust and all kinds of shit and eventually turns into a planet eventually acquires water, eventually has an atmosphere and then life comes out of it in that life spreads out into other planets and all of it seems to be this constant state of either improvement or death improvement and death improvement in death and to say that it's not building towards something.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       It's like, how the fuck do you know? How do you know? I mean, we literally might be building towards heaven and if human beings with all of our interest in trans rights and gay rights and being progressive, I really contemplate this a lot. I think about this all day. I wonder if what we're doing by this movement that you say what's like, some of it's exaggerated and ridiculous and some. Some of the people that are involved in it are ultimately really shitty people that have attached themselves to an interesting idea, but the trend seems to be inescapable and the trend of technological innovation as well as a trend of social awareness. They might, if you extrapolate, you look at where they're going, like a thousand years now, 100,000 years now, it might reach a point of really like a technologically created heaven. It is totally possible, a technologically creative having created by human beings.

Speaker 2:          00:35:28       It's created by whatever the fuck fuels a human being. We will look at it as us like human beings. We did it, but what is the what? The what is a human being? I mean there's a bunch of different instincts and a bunch of different desires that are sort of sown into the existence of being a person and they're unacceptable, inexorable, you know, you have them. If you're living in the jungle, you have them. If you're living in the city you have. I mean people just have this weird, inescapable desire to do a bunch of core things. Well, maybe those core things are very important and key ingredients towards creating technology and towards creating awareness and connection of ideas and information from entity to entity until the the entire thing. Thanks as one to the entire thing thinks is one and has massive technological capabilities and literally can escape the very dimension that is currently trapped in the dimension that it thinks is all that there is.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       This is all that there is because I can knock on it with my knuckles and I could put it on a scale and I could run a tape measure by and tell you exactly how long it is. So that's what is real, but that's not even what's real. That's what's real right now that you can experience and we might be a part of one continual never ending cycle that ultimately leads to god. Yeah. Yeah. Possible. That's the thing I don't find to say you don't say I don't believe. No, I don't think so either. I don't think. Well, I think it's arrogant to say, you know, there's no go, oh yeah. I don't think anyone knows. There's no good, but say I don't believe in god. Yeah. Okay. Well, I don't believe in god either, but I don't not believe in god. Right. Zero. God, I dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       Yeah. I've met some crazy shit and psychedelic trips. You know, I've, I've, I've had a couple of examples if you can. Well, I'm things that knew everything that I've ever done, everything that I've ever said and who I was exactly down to the core thing. What do you mean things? Entities, they're can see right through you now. What are those entities or this trip or this, this is like you meet this guy and he knows everything. Well you're, you're not meeting a guy. You're meeting like a geometric pattern that is like you can't. Especially dmt trips. You can't really isolate what something looks like because it only looks like that for the briefest of moments and then it changes and looks like something else and it changes and as you think about what it is it alters and it's almost like some bizarre lesson in perception and the and your own definitions of the world around you that you are in some way.

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       BY the way, you interface with the world changing the very nature of the world itself and this is like some weird lesson that they try to teach you while you're. WhIle you're involved in these trips, it seems like they're trying to explain to you there's. It's not just you have a bad attitude or not just anybody has a bad attitude. It's not just that you go, you get tied up in the momentum of those bad attitudes and the mistakes caused by those bad attitudes and the energy that's put out and the ripple effect of all that energy and how's it, how it goes out into the rest of the population and how it comes back to you and you get trapped like a goddamn spiderweb and explains it to you. That literally the way that you interface with the world changes the world, changes your world, changes the people that are in your world, but also changes how those people interact with other people in the world as this very freaky fucking bizarre thing to have that be told to you by gestures like giant, like gestures who have like multidimensional head that's like spinning around and giving me the finger and.

Speaker 2:          00:38:55       But I would say that's just your own, your own consciousness. It may be that as a person, it may be, or an entity or a wall or whatever. It's totally possible. We don't know what your own consciousness really means. Yeah, I mean, first of all, look, a human being is not an individual. Every human being is a host of an unknown variable. I mean like literally an uncountable number of bugs, like the amount of parasites and the amount of different bacteria. They say there's more cola in a person's body than there have ever been people ever. So think of that. Does this what? Just to just to stop and think about and you need that. If that's not in your body, you're fucked some shit. Like the fact that we even know what he call is like, science is fucking like the last 70, 80 years.

Speaker 2:          00:39:42       It's just like, what? Yeah, how, what, how to do even the fuck did you get what? I had Brian Cox on the professor who's brilliant guy who works at cern, who works at the large hadron collider. And he was trying to explain to the, you know, searching for the hadron in searching for the, um, the higgs boson particle and it halfway into the conversation like, where, why, how did you guys find this out? Who did, what did you do? You know, we're just a couple of hundred years away from a guy making fire with steel and flint. That's the onlY way they made fire clink, clink, clink. That's how they had to make fire. And you guys have figured this out. Yeah. What the fuck, man? Yeah, It's a, it's an, it's unbelievable. It's really hard to believe. Yeah. Very, very, very hard to wrap your head around.

Speaker 2:          00:40:30       What are they going at with the higgs boson, by them? What are they trying to figure out? What will that lead to while they're trying to recreate? And they, they have apparently recreated the conditions milliseconds after the big bang and prove that there is this one particle that was theoretical up until recently and they've measured it there like 99 point nine percent sure that they've isolated this particle and measured it. but along the way they've also, they've also identified a bunch of other shit that they weren't sure if it was real or or created some things that were just theoretical. One is this stuff called clark cork glue on cork glue on plasma that's insanely heavy. Like if You had a bowling ball full of this stuff, it'd be heavier than the world. Yeah. And they've figured out how to isolate that. And it's also the same sort of thing. It's something that exists like milliseconds after the big bang. It's like a part of the very creation of the universe itself. So there won't necessarily be like. And if this is then

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       we'll then all get the floating skateboard. You see the floating skateboard yesterday did of unbelievable. But I'll pull up. What's funny is how long it took me to get used to it though. I'm like, oh good, there's a floating skateboard and I like. And you just go back to your dumb life. You're not like, oh fuck, we got to get good. Okay. Yeah. It'll be totally normal. Yeah. I mean a car is fucking insane. If you didn't have a car and somebody gave you a car, is this it? Lexus has created a real rideable hoverboard. Okay. So here's a guy with a skateboard and he gets off and he stamps on it says there is no such thing as impossible and he's smoking. I don't like the smoke. I think that's a, that's an after effect. And I think it's stupid. Uh, I thought it's the best part of this ad.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       Put it. This guy is never going to smoke. It's just a matter of figuring out how. So he's going to stand on this now. Lexis hoveR the not showing you any more than that. That's the tease. You fucks. That's it. You got to see this new rx though. This thing. What is it? I'm just kidding. I'm a big fan of alexis's. Yeah. Japanese engineering. It's a little slightly different than the german engineering. All Of it's pretty fucking bad ass though. Did you have the 400 damn whatsapp video of the, the, like the 400 x. That one. The alexIs? No, I have, I have, uh, s suv. the lx five slash 70. Oh, why the rx? 400. Sorry. Yeah, they're fucking amazing. Driving living room. Yeah, it's smooth as fuck y'all. Yeah. It's so fun. Floaty floats down the highway. They make amazing automobiles. If you think about the fact that the automobile has only been around for a little over 100 years to the amount of innovation that's happened with that.

Speaker 4:          00:43:15       Yeah, and that's when It's in maths. Even retarded by other industries like it should be further along. Well, I think with this tesla shit like this elon musk character getting involved, that guy's making an suv now that's going to be an all electric. He's making a two door also. He's making a bunch of shit, but the fact that bigger thing that he did was he. He like, he basically gave up all his patents here. Just let's make it good. Let's make this an actual thing. Well, he's like a real life tOny stark type character. Yeah. He's got that new thing for the wall to new battery system for, for solar. For houses. Yeah. Because you can't get the thing that I didn't realize about solar. She can't get. He can't get it at night unless you store it. Yeah, you can't. It's really, really hard to store.

Speaker 4:          00:44:02       Well, most of the time you have these solar rooms. Like a, there was a cabin a that a friend of mine has in Colorado and she's got these uh, like solar batteries hooked up to the cabin and you know, it's like a room. Y'all gotta go into the battery rooM, see what's going on. And the batteries were dead. It was fucking awful. But it was a real problem. The guy who was staying in the cabinet, I was like, what the fuck? No, fuck them lights, you know, stupid. We're camping here. Yeah. It just wasn't working correctly. But with this ian Must thing. Elon musk's is very small. It's not that big. It's like a half about this guy and like half the table. LIke a small coffee table. Yeah. And you can put it on the wall. Can you put it on the wall? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:44:45       That's what it's for. Power wall. Yeah. See how it's got. It's up there at mounts to the wall. It's cool to home battery. That charges using electricity generated from solar panels or when utility rates are low and powers your home in the evening, it also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup. Electricity supply. Provable. That's goiNg to. I have a volt. I was going to get a tesla and I got the chevy volt because someone pointed out what if there's a power outage? Yep. That'll do it. Yeah. The volt takes both, right? Is that the deal? no, the volt. Yeah. The volt takes both it. Yeah. I can go to gas when the revolution comes. I can. That's a smart move right now. You've got your feet in both worlds. A little bit of both. Joe, do you, when you put it up with gas, does it charge the battery?

Speaker 4:          00:45:31       No, it basically you get 40 miles of electric, just sure electric. Yeah, and then once you. That's pretty stupid. I'm being honest. What do you mean not enough? The average person drives 36 miles a day, but what about those extra four miles and you'd go to get a sandwich and throw, which is a drip. A gas station were cast out. Oh, you're telling me when the revolution comes? Uh, yeah. I don't know what to tell you. You better have a power wall. you got to have one of them yellow. Elon musk. Yeah. But even then it's probably. Although no, if you have the solar, well solar is only going to work as long as the fucking weather stays exactly the same. If you have solar and you live in a place like columbus, Ohio in the winter, good luck. Fuck face. Yeah. You're not going to get much power unless they develop some sort of new shit.

Speaker 4:          00:46:18       BuT if your skies are gray, like where I grew up in boston winters, all gray, everything's gray. You're not gonna met and put maybe those new ones actually, they're better. They got to be getting better with overcast shit, but it's not like being out in the desert, palm springs, no shit like that. We could just power the whole world from it. Yeah. Hopefully that'll happen in the next 15, 20 years. What's amazing when you look at la, I mean the one resource that we have in abundance is sunshine. I mean that is the, our research really nothing with it very little because we don't have to because the dwp has a monopoly. Are you worried about the water? Yes. Yeah, me too. How could you not be like, I don't know what's going to happen? Well, we're not going to have much water. Yeah, that's going to happen. So that's a new normal thing now. Like essentially we're a, we're a giant desert city and they're going to try actually admitting what were like, no. Yeah, well we're a desert city that had intermittent rainfall, intermittent rainfall, but the reason why la was created in the first place as a hollywood, as a movie production place was because it was so consistent with its winter. That's the whole meat. That means you live in a place that sucks. I mean, it's great for the sun, but it's. Yeah, it's not good for life. Well

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       yet. We're not supposed to be here. Yeah, it's not. It's not inhabitable unless you do a lot of shit, unless you'd like. We're going to reroute the Colorado. It's just like, dude, Maybe we just just stay near the Colorado river. Well, what's interestinG is with climate change, one of the things I'm keeping an eye on iS what happens to seattle's, whether, because I have a buddy who just moved up to seattle theory about that. Yeah. And he fucking said this. Winter was amazing. He was like, dude, it barely reined. It wasn't that clOudy. It was wonderful and he was coming from brooklyn. I think seattle, portland and seattle become la and vancouver becomes san francisco too. I like the way you think. Yeah, I think that's in like 50 years, you're probably dead, right? You're dead, right? I'm a big five. Seattle getting property in vancouver a bunch.

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       You feel like I'm really. I'm really done. The race are very expensive. Real esTate in vancouver. Yes. But a lot of beautiful asian girls. Oh shit. Someone is thinking, well, they're great canadians. First of all, canadian girls to just. They're just, they're reasonable. Yeah, they're more chill. They're fun. They're more fun. Yeah, they're less. Uh, I found they've been less. Jay. You did. They're less. I don't know, the hottest girls. I have a better chance with hot age and a hot canadian girls than I do with hud. American girls. Hmm. Like the hottest girls I've dated. Generally. We're canadian. Really? Yeah. You think they're less worried about looks and more worried about. I think they're just more. They actually like care if you're nice and cool and chill and decent. Well their whole culture is just so different because it didn't come from this marauding take over the world.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       sort of a mentality that the, the United States, as you know in the United States has this leader of the world go fuck yourself. America free. toby keith. You know they don't. They don't have that up in Canada. they don't have any of that. I lot of times I think like the military industrial complex is just because we have the bumps. It's like, well, we got the bumps. It's like we got the avocados, we gotta make some fucking guacamole, man. We fucking paid for the bumps. It's fucking use these things. We'll talk about a cycle. That's the cycle. It's like you can't not extract that money. The people that are making bombs and the people that are involved in the and they can't not do that. If they see that they're not going to stop, it's too much money. They're not going to stop asking. We just have to stop giving it to them.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       What do you make of the thing of like? Well, the thing of light lost jobs because that, that's not an argument to me. Lost jobs from the military industrial complex. Like we ain't got away. We're going to, man, I got 8,000 people in my district and all that shit. It's like, well, fucking having to do something else. Same thing with coal. They say that about coal industry. They said about horseshoes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, precisely. It's like, well, what about the blacksmiths? Yeah. He put in a lot of black students at your fancy fucking fancy car. Well, that's the other thing is when computers and robots take over, there

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       will be blue collar people breaking into factories to beat up the robots. Probably. They really go in the sledge hammers and they'll start, which I believe is the, uh, is the definition of a, a what a luddite is, are people that were so anti. Yes. Robot that they beat them up. They beat machines up. Right. It wasn't really. Was so fucking wrong. Yeah. they're not wrong. Yeah. That was, that was like during the industrial age, right? Look at this member of any bands of english workers who destroyed machinery, especially in cotton and woolen mills and they believe with threatening their jobs in 18, 11 to 18, 60. That will be, that will be a he, I believe that will be a huge thing. Yeah. It's like. But stan hopes you ever hear stainless bit about like should, where they're like, oh, it's only a five percent unemployment.

Speaker 4:          00:51:28       It's like, shouldn't we be going for hundred percent unemployment? Like don't we all just not want to work? Like why are we going toward this fucking dumb work thing when we could just. Why don't we all figure it out? So we'd. none of us have to work because people have associated working with making money and making money with staying alive and the only way you can contribute as if you work and the only way you can get money to stay alive as if you were in this. The one thing that everybody's worried about, right? Everybody's worried about not being able to pay their bills and starving to death. Yeah. HavIng their children go hungry and like, fuck, what if we. What if we live like the places that we know exist all over the world and this place is all over the world where children go hungry.

Speaker 4:          00:52:08       Well, there's also that protestant work ethic thing where it's like it's next to godliness. It becomes one, two gods smiled. You know what I mean? Like when the man work, like that's a huge tenant. Well don't you think that that's one of those, those tenants that those existed because they were trying to instill this idea of you have to stay alive and so it's good to, to work hard. It's nobody wants to fucking farm and plow the fields, but if you don't do it, we're all going to fucking star, so let's make it a religious ethic. Let's make it a super important thing to god really likes and when you plow, god loves it. When you plant seeds, sow the seed. Go do it. Yeah, I'd loves it. Is it even possible to have, would that be possible to have it 100 percent unemployment? You know like could society.

Speaker 4:          00:52:50       Society is based on bartering and trading and. Yeah, and there's also work that people like to do. What about that? What if you're a dentist and you enjoy doing dentistry? You want 100 percent employment placement and I have all these clients. I enjoy fixing their teeth. What's the fucking robots, bro? I went to school for it. I'm fascinated. I got robots though, but you didn't go to school, but you didn't go to school. You didn't have people that are car enthusiasts that fix cars. What about people that make clothes that are really into designing clothes? I you still do it, but the idea that you have to do it to survive,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       I think it's just an intro. I don't disagree with them. Hmm. Like that you'd want someone in this robot's someone would have to make the robots. Right. That's work, but at some point someone's going to have to work in the robots. Even if there's robots making robots, someone has to serve as the superhero. You know what I mean? Like so someone's going to have to work and then that guy is going to want shit for the work he did and then it just becomes a bartering society.

Speaker 2:          00:53:51       It doesn't seem like it's ever possible to go to 100 percent, but you might be able to get down to like 10 percent plus robots. Yeah. If you get down to 10 percent working 90 percent, that's an imposing sentence by blank blank plus robots. Yeah. Because once you've got robots in the mix, everything changes. You don't need a whole lot of people to run the robot because you get robots that fix robots and the robots to fix the robot, to fix the robots. Who watches the watch with water? That is robots. The robots. I mean you would have to make sure that also that the people that did do all the work were they, that you kept a steady supply of them and kept them educated because if you didn't and then we ran out of people that knew how to fix the robots and then we're just scrambling like we have to relearn how to fix robots.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       There was a book, I think it was a white noise, don delillo, but it talked about like, I couldn't fucking fix a clock. I couldn't fix it. I couldn't fix the light. I couldn't fix any if something. Like if I was the last guy, like I couldn't fix shit at all.

Speaker 2:          00:54:53       We know how to hold bit about that, about dumb people like not realizing they're dumb because they buy a lot of smart things that other people figured out. then one day the power goes out and I'm like, what do you do when the power goes out? Well, what I usually do is I sit around and wait. I figured someone's fixing that shit. Then that person is that person's dead and no one would know what happened to. Yeah. And the, uh, the idea that job was if I left you alone alone in the woods with a hatchet, how long before you could send me an email like, oh, how long would it take? Nobody knows how to make a fucking computer. Nobody knows how to build an engine. Who the fuck knows how to forge metal, pull it, pull it out of the ground and turn into a cash buyer. You know what I mean? I couldn't. I meAn I would literally, if I started a fire, it would be based on shit I saw on survivor. I swear to god. I think I could start a fire if I have the right stuff, but you have to make sure you have the right stuff and it wouldn't be easy. It's not easy at all. Like you'd have to have rope and a stick and stick.

Speaker 3:          00:55:53       Yeah. Like that sort of thing that they do. It becomes a bow and then like it seems, I don't know when to like

Speaker 2:          00:56:00       yo go over to the thing to the. Well, you know, there's a guy on, on, um, there's a show called life below zero and this fucking dude doesn't bring matches with him because he doesn't want to rely on matches because what if I, what if I run out of matches? Yeah, I would if I rely on live. So he, his mouthpiece thAt he puts in and then he has a stick, put cv, there's a video of it. His name is glenn. Pull up glenn from life below zero, makes a fire on youtube and he puts this bit, is this piece in his mouth and the piece like clamps down on the top of the stick so that he could use the bow with two hands and really get a lot of friction. so you as the bow that's wrapped around those string of the bose wrapped around the stick and he's going right to left, right to left, right to left, right to left.

Speaker 2:          00:56:42       And as, as it spins, the friction starts, see little smoke and he's pushing like dry can tinder in there. And then he gets like a little ball of fire and then he builds it up. How long have you see it? It doesn't. No. It doesn't make too much to carry around in your mouth, right? Sure. It has to be online. If it's not online, they should be fired. Here we go. Here we go. So this guy, this is how he does it all the time. Give it some, some volume. So we'll see. I don't use a headlamp because what happens if I run out of headlamps? It's true. It's 40 below zero waste. Filming what this mouthpiece is made out of caribou. This guy's supported living so gangster up there. So he holds his caribou antler piece in his mouth. Then he wraps a string around his fucker. Watch how he does this. This is pretty wild.

Speaker 2:          00:57:31       So he's pulling right left, right, right, right. And watch how quick it works. Wow. Isn't that nuts? yeah. It's incredible. And he has this fire starting thing. Any reuse it over and over again because the more he does it, his teeth are ruined. We should point out yes. Either fart bite, not caribou antlers. Bitch was trying to do. And so then he reuses that the little thin plate of wood that he has underneath it. Reuse that over and over again. So it's sort of blAck and charred, which makes it a little bit more flammable. None. AmazIng. That's awesome. saw this motherfucker. Makes her fire. And you saw a quick. It was. Yeah. But joe kenney write a joke. Nope, he's not perfect. He's not. He's not the uber mush. I have him write a sketch. Nope. See how they look at you. You're. Yeah. Well you think you could do this? Hey, strongest man. Do a fucking strong seven bro. Yeah. How about you write for chris rock? Strongest man. You fucking piece of fucking jumoke. Oh great. You could pick up a big stone ball. You fucking done. You know what else can do that attractor? Yeah. You're human tractor. Fuckface yeah. With jokes. Yeah. Go do, do it. Take seven. The crowd up your warm. The crowd up for at midnight.

Speaker 2:          00:58:52       Brody's job. Enjoy it. Eight one. He yelled out. Eight. One eight till I die last night on stage. And the fucking place broke out into applause when he was at the ice house last night when he was hilarious. Yeah, he's very funny. But the yelling out eight, one eight till I die. and the place just wet. Yeah. That's great. They know, they know what to expect from brody stevens. I like that. He's

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       like carved out a little thing from some people have like really like kimmel. Those kinds of guys like people who really appreciate brody have made a big girl. But zach alpha access to. Yeah, big, big fan made a big deal about them. It's really, it's nice to see them getting. He still doesn't get the attention that it deserves. I want to do something where we do it in conjunction with the comedy store and we filmed brody's late night sets. Just film a gang of them and then find the gem, find that one jam and take that and turn it into a comedy special. Yeah. Because someone easy to do because some of those shelves that he Does, those late night shows, they're just fucking magical. Magical shows. Like very inspired. Yeah. Just not off the fucking charts weird, you know, the narratives that he creates in the audience with the various people that he's fucking around with all completely ad lib as opposed to those fake ad lib guys.

Speaker 4:          01:00:18       You know those fake ad lib guys I know exists. I haven't caught anyone. Oh, you know what I mean? Are there some that we know? Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah, there's a lot. Not that much anymore because people are getting hip to it, but there used to be a bunch of guys who every night would pretend, look at this guy. He's thinking, well, he's like, well, and she's wired wrong, but they say the same thing every night and everyone like, oh my god, it's so brilliant. Yeah. But it's really an act. It's an act that pretends to be an ad libbed act. Yeah. I would agree with that motherfucker. This motherfucker making, you know, how dare they make 61 grand a year? How dare they feel lucky. Yeah. So tell me about this fucking thing that you just did. All right. For anybody who doesn't know what ketamine is, I will tell them.

Speaker 4:          01:01:09       I'll tell the whole narrative. The last one of the times I was here, we talked about five htP. Yeah. Um, that was a long time ago. That got me into it and that's how when we started creating new mood. Yeah. so I taken five htp. I basically had depression most of my adult life, probably my whole life. ANd uh, and when you define depression, like right now I'm talking to you. We're hanging out, we're having fun, we're laughing. Everything seems cool right now. You're great. Yeah. When does it slip in it? Here's the thing, it's not, I was never suicidal. It was never, it was just like kind of a, like the best I could feel what I could feel his adrenaline and ego, do you know what I mean? But it was never like joy, happiness, sort of, you know, like the more I'm fuzzy or stuff, so I couldn't feel. It just didN't happen. No joy, no happiness. Not really. Again, not but not miserable. Okay. But let me ask you this, while this is going on and great things would happen to. Yeah, like you had some great things happening. first of all, you know the cocreative chappelle show, which is, in my opinion, the greatest sketch comedy the world's ever known. Yeah. so that was a great thing. Yes. During that time, was there joy?

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       Uh, there was ego ego and there was adrenaline, but there was never. It never felt like my brain would like talk me out of it. It would talk me out of why I should Be, why I should enjoy it, if that makes sense. like it would talk me out of it, just like, well, yeah, but you, you had a partner and you get to do this.

Speaker 4:          01:02:48       Okay. So your brain would tell you, well, you know, you're doing well, but let's be honest, you're doing it beCause of dave chappelle and, you know, even though you're running is really great, would it be so great if skippy from family ties are the star of the show? The show would still, I would say yes. Okay. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. One hundred percent. No disrespect to skippy. Yeah. Um, so that was,

Speaker 3:          01:03:07       that's when I knew I needed to go on antidepressants is I sold a script in like 1999 and I was on the phone with an agent who was saying that to studios were bidding for it and I was driving up labrea crying

Speaker 4:          01:03:26       on the phone with the guy and tears were running down my face. I'm like, this isn't right. wow. Yeah. So you were crying because you still felt like shit. Yeah, just

Speaker 3:          01:03:33       felt like shit. Yeah. I just felt like shit, I am part of the shit was like, I can't even fucking enjoy this. Right. You know what I mean? Like just like I wish I could

Speaker 4:          01:03:42       feel this shit. Right. So your tiers were like tiers of like, god damn it, how come I can't even feel this?

Speaker 3:          01:03:49       Like why even do this shit right if you're not. And that's what I would get out of his ego, like, like adrenaline from being in a cool situation or doing something cool or whatever. Even killing onstage. Like for example, people, when I know certain people get offstage when, for instance chris rock to bring them up again, when he gets off stage, he is the nicest. He's so fucking gacked off of the crowd. He so just like high on adrenaline and like just good feeling and basically like, like, uh, like just good, like a fucking chemicals that are escaping me. But like serotonin shit like that, he's just hits yet domain san antonio, he's just fucking flying, right? I would never feel like that. I feel like, oh, I just fucking murdered. But I would never be like, cause I'm, there was no, I wouldn't enjoy it, enjoy it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       I wouldn't enjoy it, I wouldn't not enjoy it. But it was flat. It was flat. It was like, I might not, I might as well have not done that, but it didn't. Me and deb one time talked about about getting upstaged. Sometimes you just want to take the mic and throw it down. [inaudible]. It's like, well fucking, that didn't even help. Um, so, so, so I've taken antidepressants for, since I was crying on the price in 1999. So, uh, so I took them and I zoloft at first were great, really work well and I remember telling a chappelle, I think I said I go, I now know why people dance. Like that was how I knew like, oh, this works because I understand the feeling that it would make people want to dance or just like that sort of collective. Um, do you want to vive for lack of better word. So, so did that. Took zoloft probably worked for 10 years, nine, 10 years, you know, with very in fact, but after awhile it just stopped working. Now when it stopped working, when I or when I would try to go off it, my, I would get like a tension in my. I'm a fucking temple that literally couldn't like a knot in my template. Like if you needed to get massaged it would just form. And that's how I knew like oh, I'm fucking depressed again because it would just form. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:06:18       and what, what was, when you said it wasn't working. So what was the shift? It starteD working in beginning. It was great. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:06:25       there is a term for it and I always forget it, but it's like that. It just stopped. It's like an efficacy, longterm efficacy. Just

Speaker 2:          01:06:33       tampers decreases. Yeah. And that's specific to zoloft.

Speaker 3:          01:06:37       It's all them, all of them. It can be all of them. Um, so then I switched to a I've, and then probably the last four or five years I've switched a bunch because all the ones I tried had some side effect.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       What is the feeling though that you have on them? Is it like a feeling of you have like more energy? Do you have a little more enthusiasm?

Speaker 3:          01:06:59       You have more. You have like more generosity of spirit, if that makes sense. Like, just like you want your less of like a hater. Hmm. Uh, because you're not, you don't feel so depleted yourself that you can actually be like, oh, that's good man. That's fucking awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       What's hard for people to be happy for other people? If they're not happy about 100 percent, it's very hard because no one's mean because they're in a good mood. You know what I mean? Like other people don't deserve happiness. You can't get it. Yeah. Why the fuck did you get it? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:30       Um, so that's like any troll. It's like you just see it's because you're unhappy man. It's like I get it. Just don't take my success isn't your failure, but that's how it feels because you can't do it. You can't even get. Not can. Not only can you not do standard, whatever the thing they're mad at you for, they can't even feel what they imagine you feel from doing it. Uh, so, so I tried a bunch. The last four or five years they would work with are some side effects. Nausea, a one. I was like gaining weight and I wasn't eating and I was gaining weight. Um, Yeah, it was so weird. I'm a shit like that. And then the last one was um, nausea and my dick was in a coma. well, like literally I took a fucking pro, the boner drug and um, agora. Yeah, it didn't work. But yeah, generally how fucking like

Speaker 4:          01:08:26       dan, it was like literally, it's like put the bucket and chart what the fucking clear. Clear back nothing. Wow. Yeah. So you had to get off that immediately. Yeah. Well the. Yeah. It was so important. Happiness or boners? Well, what was interesting is it was,

Speaker 3:          01:08:44       it was, it was interesting for the few months that I had it to not have to worry aBout boners boners are pursuing, girls are fucking texting and, and, and tendering and all that shit. Just like I don't give a shit.

Speaker 4:          01:08:58       Wow. Now when they seem like nice people, now what does it do? Does it, does it somehow another deplete your testosterone? Does it? I don't know why that. The thing about antidepressants,

Speaker 3:          01:09:12       they don't know why they work. They know that they work. They have theories about why they work. Like the. I was on a class of antidepressants called ssrs, which are short for a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which means it's basically a double negative, a re uptake inhibitor. It's basically when you, when the, when the serotonin goes out, usually it gets collected quickly, but if you take this drug, it leaves the serotonin out in your brain longer. I believe sarah re uptake inhibitor. Yeah. So it gets, it inhibits the uptake so it like, hey, stay out. Hey, run around a little bit, you know what I mean? Saratoga. So if you take, if you take the drug, I think if I, if I didn't take the drug it would be a, I don't know, I guess it was my brain would collect it super quick. I'm of the mind that I don't have enough serotonin to begin with. Like I just have, I feel like I have a serotonin deficiency naturally, but whatever. So uh, so I'm. So my dick was in a coma and I was throwing up like pretty regularly. Like how often? Like three Days a week. Wow. I just be driving and go like, oh, I'm going to throw up and throw up and then be fine.

Speaker 4:          01:10:31       So essentially what these drugs you're trying to somehow or another reengineer your, your neuro chemical makeup?

Speaker 3:          01:10:38       Yeah. Yeah. I mean you're trying to help it basically. I don't think you can reengineer it. I'll get to the reengineering, but I don't. I think with the drugs you just go like, it's basically a bandaid. It just like, hey, reroute ain't go over there. It's never like you're, you're fucking synapses are in different places. You know what I mean? It's like,

Speaker 4:          01:10:58       but it's amazing that they're doing this and they're not exactly sure as you say, how they work. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       Yeah. They don't. They really don't. They have theory. Obviously they know that ssrs radio, they selectively, you know, up to the whatever fucking. But they don't know exactly. They don't even know if, if it'S in your brain or if it's in your stomach, there's a new thing. There was an article in the atlantic two days ago that's saying a lot of. First of all, you're all of like all those chemicals we talked about, lIke sarah tunnel and stuff. It's mostly in your stomach. Um, which people don't know. Um, so they are basically saying like, they're, they're, they're, they're lookIng in people's feces and they think that the amount of chemicals or combinations you have in your stomach, it can affect mood.

Speaker 4:          01:11:50       Wow. Yeah. Well, that's what the concept behind probiotics affecting the mood are 100 percent. By the way. I was getting a bunch of colds and I started taking probiotics and haven't got one to die harm. I almost never get sick. Yeah. I drink kombucha everyday. Yeah. I have a, the gts kombucha, the kind that you have to have an id to show because it is moRe than one half of one percent of our. That's all it is. A tiny, tiny. You'd have to drInk like 30 of them to catch the bus you'd get from one beer, but it's worth it. Yeah. Um, but uh, it's, it's a stupid law, but the probiotic effect of the fermentation of this live cultures, it's causing the alcohol. yeah. But it's so good for you, man. YeAh, it's been crazy. Changed my life. Like traveling. you should make me sick.

Speaker 4:          01:12:38       It was always getting sick. I don't get sick anymore. If I do get sick, it's very quick in and out. So quick turnaround. Yeah. I would highly recommend it because if you're traveling all the time on a, as a comIc on the road, like your immune system takes a fucking. Even in firstclass gel, it does. Even first class I wrote coach the other day for the first time in a long time, people were touching me, sitting there, I was like, why are you touchIng your leg is touching my leg. Whatever you get. It's obviously something comforting about that. Everybody's touching each other. He's sitting there and you're, you know that your arm's gonna touch the guy next to you and everybody accepts that we're all. This is the world we're living in. Okay. I mean, why is that bad? As long as everyone's arm is touching everyone.

Speaker 4:          01:13:17       Yeah, I'm cool. And as long as no one gets greedy with the, as long as everyone's like, friendly with the space, you know, you don't man spread and bop into the other guy's side and you know, but also hygiene, that's a big one. It's huge because if you touch them people and they stink, that's fucking brutal. And I've had that. How long the flight was two flights. What happened was I'm to vegas or something. No, it was to Canada. I fucked up and I'm so stupid. just donor move. My flight takes off. It took off at a certain time. And uh, I had it written the time I was supposed to get up, uh, had reversed. So instead of thinking that I was supposed to get up at 9:00 flight, the flight was at 9:00 and I was like, oh no. Like I thought the flight was at like 11 and I got there in the future. I think

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       you should just go based on what time of flight leaves. I don't leave it up to the airline, what time you should wake up,

Speaker 2:          01:14:19       what was just such a boneheaded move. I just had too many different things going on and I wrote it down somewhere and you just incorrectly wrote it down. Yeah. But anyway, point being I had to switch the flights, blah blah blah. And I was thinking like, it's kinda like the only time where people ever touched people that they don't know except jujitsu class maybe, you know. And then you try to kill each other. Mass transit, mass transit. Especially like you said, tokyo, tokyo, rather that they push people in. They literally have guys whose jobs are to shove people deeper and deeper into those boxes.

Speaker 3:          01:14:49       Yeah, they're made, they make six figures doing that.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       People get depressed, some people get depressed from a lack of human contact.

Speaker 3:          01:14:58       Absolutely. I'll get to that in a second. UM, so. Okay. So I was just like taking like the last one. I was like, I'm so sick of fucking taking [inaudible] the thing with antidepressant pills is that you don't, It's a complete guessing it what's gonna work for you? Because the one I was taking that was making my dick fall asleep and make me throw up was supposed to have the lowest uh, side effect profile of all of them. But I've had ones that had more that were supposed to do worship shit and they didn't. So, so I was like, I'm so sick of this, so I just started looking up other shit to do. Um, and the, the big one that I, that kept coming up that I saw was ketamine. So I was like, that's interesting. Like I didn't really, I knew it was like a party drug and I didn't really know that much about it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       It's a very weird party drugs. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't done it. I'm like, why the fuck would you ever take that around people? Um, but, so, so there's a guy in santa monica, dr stephen, man dell, and um, that's a picture of me getting to talk about this guy on. I don't know. I mean, I think I can. Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, the guy's name he mentioned, I don't mind if you. Okay. So, uh, so he, he, he was an anesthesiologist who basically came up with a Regimen for, that's for depression and he's, by the way, he's not the only one. Like there's, there's probably hundreds in America right now that are doIng this with ketamine. Yeah. Whoa. Uh, especially if you go on reddit or um, and he liked the ending of the boards and any kind of like a antidepressant boards or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:16:42       Uh, there's people that did it and there's another one called tms, which is the other one that's making a comeback is just the, the cuckoo's nest one, the electrical shock therapy because they were doing it wrong apparently. And there a way to do it now, like you just, the, the, the amperage was too high. So there was just fucking fry cooking if you cook it a little bit. Yeah, exactly. You don't want to it. Yeah. Precisely. You little something steam it. Yeah. You can punch in a. but you should throw an egg on you, your fucking website. So that's, that's made a comeback. And then there's another one called transcranial magnetic stimulation where they just basically shoot magnet, said your brain. Um, and, but that's five days a week for five weeks. academy kids. The treatment is you do six sessions in two weeks. Oh, I'm.

Speaker 3:          01:17:37       So it's monday, wednesday, friday of two weeks. And I did it last week and the week before. So first time I go in a and again, I don't know if I could have researched it all. I knew that was what then you, when you go in you have basically when you do ketamine you have like an out of body sort of experienced meaning, like a dissociative experience. So which seems pretty vague. Um, so I, so he hooks the ivy up and um, and within 15 seconds I was like gone. Like at first you just get sleepy and then I was in the trip that you were talking about things to fucking geometric shapes, all kinds. The thing about tripping that I forgot is how good the transitions are, is like it'll go from geometric safety, like a bear's face to just like just crazy shit for 45 minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:18:36       Um, and then you come out of it and you slowly come out of it and you were like noise canceling headphones. I'm just at a doctor's office, like in a weird, not even weird, like those like 19 seventies doctors' offices that you see in la, like just sort of a shitty elevator and whatever. Um, so when I came out of the first one I was like, it was rough because I didn't know it was going to trip like that. And b, I had been, I didn't get a ton of sleep the night before and uh, so I was, and I'd flown that day. I was just kind of groggy and uh, and I felt really shitty and it took me like I was like, after I was done, I probably laid in the bed there for like an hour, so it was like, I can't do shit right now.

Speaker 3:          01:19:22       Like I can't, I could barely stand. So the first day was rough and uh, and that I still felt shitty that night and I was like, I don't think I'm going to do it again. Like, that was too rough. And then I woke up tuesday morning and felt fucking great. I was like, oh, um, I got to do it again, felt great. I felt clear. Here's the, one of the ways my, uh, depression manifested itself was like, I felt my head felt heavy and I felt like I had like, I had like a lead weight on my forehead, you know, that's the way I felt when I did ecstasy. You say after the day after I felt it felt amazing when I did it. And that's what it is because it depletes. Yeah. You get all the serotonin's gun. Yeah. And that's basically what people with depression a lot of times are like just everyday isn't just like a headwind.

Speaker 3:          01:20:21       It's not, it's just like fucking, could thIs be a little bit easier, like I'm not asking for a miracle and just like I'm just sick of having to walk into the wind all the time. Right. A little bit uphill into the windows. Fuck. Alright. So I did it again that wednesday and every time I did it, um, the, the, the other thing that, one of the ways that they kind of gauge it as, do you do like a inventory, a questionnaire, like a 25 question questionnaire. Like how do you feel about your future? And like, it's like not good, fine, neutral, whatever. Um, each one has a point value. They add it up if it's like in the teens or high teens or twenties, that means you're depressed if you're in the under, you know, the low teens, you're good, whatever. And I think mine went from low twenties to like single digits in the two weeks.

Speaker 3:          01:21:19       Wow. And the only downside, and I can't get it like perfectly clear read because I'm quitting the ssri when the, the, the one that, the deq killer, I'm quitting that at the same time. so I'm just like, that's, I'm sort of having withdrawal from that and the way it was manifesting itself for a couple of weeks was like, I just felt like shit. I just felt like I had the flu but not coughing or sneezing. Just like rundown. When you wean yourself off of an ssri, is there a protocol for doing that? This paper, that's all you can do. And whEn they say taper, like you have like x, do you get smaller pills? Dei. You just clip them in half and that's what I did. And you take less of them? Yeah. You just do you go? I was on 21 to 10. One to five nomad.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       Zero. And in how long you've been at zero? I don't know. I think three or four weeks. So how do you feel? Right now? I feel I feel better every day from the, from the ssri effect has gotten better every day. I feel like I don't feel nauseous, I'm not nauseous, just like, I don't feel like shit. The onlY way it's kind of manifesting itself now is like, one of my eyes is a little flight. Feels like I have something in it. Just the gay. I got it. J and j guy. Um, what it is. Uh, yeah. So one of my eyes feels a little gay, so as he was, there's no other word for it. Um, so I just put eyedrops in. That's it. Yeah. And it might be unrelated. The eyeball thing that I think it's related because I've looked it up. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's like, there's, you know, ssri withdrawal if you just google that and they have eyeballs issues. Yeah. It's like you'll be a little cloudy, huh? Some people, it usually lasts like three weeks. Some people. I've seen guys on reddit that were like, I fucking had this for six months. Jesus, which would make me crazy, I think.

Speaker 2:          01:23:10       Yeah. How could you not be? So let me ask You this, so you, you take it the first time and how many days afterwards did you feel great? You said two, one, one day the next day feel like shit after it's over.

Speaker 3:          01:23:22       Felt like shit the after it was over, felt like basically went home and just laid in my, on my account.

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Did you feel like physically worn out? Like

Speaker 3:          01:23:31       I just felt like, um, I guess like I had a high fever, you know, that feeling. It's just like I can't do shit.

Speaker 2:          01:23:40       Was it possible that it was the stress of the experience? Because you didn't know?

Speaker 3:          01:23:45       Possibly. Yeah, because you ever haD anesthesia. You don't want to come out of it. It feels that's like my least favorite feeling in the world. That's basically what it was that feeling of like, oh fuck. Like I could throw up. I'm not gonna.

Speaker 2:          01:23:59       So it could be a bunch of issues. Do you have the same feeling every time he did it?

Speaker 3:          01:24:05       Yeah. Basically I would need to take a nap every time. Yeah. Um, because basically when I did it on the wednesday, I took a nap and did a spot that night. Wow. Yeah. Um, I ran into that night. We talked about, it was at the improv. Maybe my ran into you at the store and you told me the last treatment that day. Yeah, but that was friday. It was like a less than a week ago. Yeah, I'm okay. It's different time that end, that friday because I had done it enough, but what I found, what was interesting was every session it would take me longer to go into the trip, meaning like my body was getting used to. It was building up a tolerance for it, for the ketamine. How long haS it's all ivy ivy based. The first time, like I said, 20 seconds and the last time was probably four or five minutes. Oh yeah. And he was upping The dose I think. Wow. I'm so

Speaker 2:          01:25:07       well I ran into after the first time you did it and I ran into you. I think friday was after the last time you did it. Yeah. And unfortunately we didn't have a chance to talk much until now, so I couldn't like get an objective sense of how you seemed.

Speaker 3:          01:25:21       Yeah. What was Interesting was like the friday of the first week I had, it might have been friday or saturday, but there was a thing that was happening to me on stage where I was for like months. I felt shitty. You know, when you feel shitty, you can't kill that hard. Like there's basically a cap. I had a cap on my sets for months and it was making me fucking crazy because it was like eighth. Not me, like it's my, it's a this fucking eighth depRession beats the ssrs and now it's the ssrs and the a ketamine, but I on the friday or saturday I fucking murdered in the main room, which you know, is like a but it because I was clear. Do you know what I mean? Like I was finallY like, oh, I know the audience wouldn't feel like a slugginess to me. There was like a real, like, you know, more of just like a laser focus. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:26:17       on point. Yeah. Yeah man. I've had nights Where I'm tired. That is the worst god damn feelIng when you're exhausted and trying to come up with energy to go on stage when you're physically our bodies physically exhausted. Yeah. So you were kind of battling that a lot and so then you're taking it

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       affects writing to machine depressed. Like I haven't written. I've, I thiNk I've got basically two an hour but it took me like two years. Like it wasn't like I'm not like you where I can take a couple months and just come with the newer bernie. These guys like first of all, I think it would take me longer than six months anyway, but it was in part of it. I wanted to go like I'm, my fucking brain isn't working because I just run out of options in terms of ssri and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       So I'm also, that's a primary focus of your mind. It's like how do, how the fuck do I get happy? You're trying to million different medications, all these different ideas and like it's just frustrating. So. Okay. So you do it the first time and then the next day you feel great. You are still on the ssri or your window? I was done. I mean i'vE done now withdrawing off of them because this is something that is a big issue with iowasca. No, the I say, look, I'm talking to john bosco. Oh, you take iowasca guilt die, right? Well, it's very dangerous. Ssri or dangerous with iowasca with dimethyltryptamine, with in mushrooms are very closely related to d to dimethyltryptamine. Yeah. There's people that take mushrooms and they also are taking an ssri and I've heard that. That's kind of funky too. I'm trying to think if I've ever done that.

Speaker 2:          01:27:50       Ari was on ssri I think, and he was taking mushrooms, so I think I've done that. Maybe he was on a different kind of. I think I've met a pagan ssri. I know for a fact are. He did ask his doctor and told him and apparently the type of medication he was on, it was fine with nordstrom's. The ta, I think I did it once or twice on ssr is fine, which really dangerous apparently is if you take a prescription mao inhibitor and then you take mushrooms or you take iowasca, then it's super fucking devic. Mio.

Speaker 3:          01:28:19       Mao inhibitors have a big profile which like don't take it to the other shit that has more. That's on more warning for the most thing. Yeah, I, I, I believe I've read this. I'm like 98 percent sure I read this. Most people. Oh, I did read it. It was a, this guy Carl Hart, who'd be a great guest. Adam. Oh, alright, there you go. That guy's fucking awesome. I'm said that most people that die of heroin overdoses are drunk like the, the most of the overdoses are because they combined it with alcohol. That makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:28:51       He was on o'reilly the other day and I texted him. I was like, how the fuck do you do that? Like you talked for five seconds and he's touching you, and then they caught away him for a breaking news report on the lady getting arraigned and upstate New York for helping the prisoners escape. There's a panel, there's him and a bunch of other people. They're all talking about drugs and he barely got a chance to talk. It's also like, what good does that shit too. That's what I always wonder. Like when they go, hey, you want to come on a panel on cnn? I'm like, no, I'm not going to change any minds. And it's also shitty way of community. Yeah, exactly. This is the way to communicate. Yes. This is the best way in woodland hills. Hit it off as part. Yeah. That's shitty. Office park. This is the way to do it, right? Under lighting. So you. So you go and you do it the first time that day afterwards, you start to feel better in the way.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       Uh, I would compare the trip in and of itself the actual trip like lsd,

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       lsd, but ellis without the speed. But with a lot of visuals though. All visuals. All visual. Yeah. Crazy. the way mckenna described ketamine, I've never done ketamine the way, um, you know, makenna and john lilly was a huge pioneer of ketamine, you know, gun. John lilly's the guy who invented the isolation tank, one of his things that he used to like to do is shoot ketamine in a muscularly, intramuscularly, shove it right into his fucking muscle. I think that's what I did. I mean you did it, but the intramuscular is a slower release and apparent last for hours and he would bang whack himself and climate of the tank and be gone for a fun day. Just zoom around crazy and mckenna described it like he. This is a very interesting way of describing psychedelics. He believed whether or not I was to correct it, but he believed that every psychedelic you take your.

Speaker 2:          01:30:43       You're experiencing not just your trip, but the trip of all the people who've ever tripped on that psychedelic. So when you're taking mushrooms, you're not just experiencing the mushroom, you're experiencing the mushroom as it has interfaced with countless human beings, all throughout humanity, all the different people have taken the mushrooms and had these beautiful experiences. You experienced those experiences as well. It's. Yeah, but I, I don't, I don't disagree. I don't agree with that because I can't put it seems like. Yeah, that's possible, but what he said about ketamine was he felt like ketamine was a new drug and these felt like when he took ketamine that he was in a giant office building that was empty. It's like a vacant office building. He's like, he would walk around and there was no one there who would like look around. There was cubicles, there was lights, there was this big open spaces, but there was no one in the room. it was just devoid of the kind of experience that you have when you take other sorts of psychedelics. Did you expire within

Speaker 3:          01:31:39       the things that. I remember one of the things I remember was like getting. I would start on me and then just pull out wide, like a, for lack of a better example, like google maps or in my head it was more like, um, grand theft auto and like where I am, uh, there's the, the, the, I'm in santa monica and I just go, there's California, there's whatever. like, um, I was aware of every sort of your whole experience of people that I went to high school with people that I know now, like just every woman's sort of, they're not like actually, but sort of, you know, I think about them. Um, and then it was like I was in the matrix is too simplistic. But you, did you see the new, uh, lAnded the last perhaps will pharrel there's just a weird black void scene.

Speaker 3:          01:32:35       Like it's like basically a black void with like a tron floor. Um, this was like a, it was, it was, there was no tron floor, like the, the, it was a white sort of, it was more of a disco floor actually then have white. This was, I didn't have the disco floor but I did have the sort of black void and then shit would form out of that and it was sort of lit the, like it was like the fill lighting as they call it would be green. so like the way your walls red it would be great. Um, so, and it was a very, he just made a great. I'm back there. So the trip was pleasant, it was never like, I've never freaked out. I never.

Speaker 4:          01:33:18       Did you experience at entities, does anything that you were communicating with you, there was all just shapes? Yeah, it was all shapes. So it was just shapes and feelings, like shapes and like I would think of stuff. And when you say you would think of stuff, was the stuff that you would think of related to depression? Was it related to that? Because what I'm trying to do right, you know what I mean? Um, so like what kind of stuff was going through your head while you're having this? Like about it,

Speaker 3:          01:33:45       like love and fucking like the time I went in the hulk music on, into anytime someone starts the time I did the, the float labs thing made me get a dog because I went to float labs and I floated and I was in the middle of like, I got you got to love something man. And I got it up. Um, the uh, and that dog has been the bane of my existence. I'm getting that dog has bit more people talk to you for sending me the pills. Old ladies. So, uh, so. So yeah, I thought about life, just think about it, but it wasn't that much. It wasn't, it was more. Yeah. I thought about like, what if there's an earthquake also like fucking if you're, if you're tripping on, on like ketamine, you're gone. I'm, my eyes are closed. I couldn't open them. Like I wouldn't physically been able to open them. I'm obviously what if there's an earthquake, but then I just feel like,

Speaker 4:          01:34:45       wow, what a weird thing to focus on. So you try to sell it to my. It would just come into my like, don't you get that when you're on weed though? sometimes I don't do weed. Oh that's right. We will let you consider all the possible fuckups that could go wrong. even the earthquake, I was like, man, I get demolished till you die. Everybody's going to die. It felt like more of like a. It was like, it was going to be like the san andreas and the rock would not say, well, what would they think about that? When it comes to psychedelic experiences is like, it's your thing about psychedelic experiences that's universal is the eagle dissolving properties of it and they think that a lot of this wood, that feeling is when you're trying to, you know, to try to think about all the things that go wrong, it's almost your ego not wanting to let go. So like, hey, you need the man because one of the flood and earthquake happens, or what if you know, what if something's happening right now? What if someone's breaking into your car? What about the paranoia and the fear? The survival instinct as a part of the ego. It felt like

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       I was backstage in my brain. That makes sense, huh? Like I was seeing the mechanations I was feeling, but I'd also like see the see like how it got there.

Speaker 4:          01:35:56       So you can see the wiring. Yeah, that's what I always feel like when I do. When I did lsd, am I. When I, when I did the ketamine, I was like, oh, it feels like you're. It feels like my brain. I feel like I'm like getting a tour of my brain. So what supposed to be the mechanism for repair or for and another thing that they don't know

Speaker 3:          01:36:15       really know they don't know, but I can tell you that it worked like [inaudible]. I felt I felt better every day. It has to do with the ssrs for sure. But I Also feel like the thing that's been, I've been noticing is, and thIs is such a weird symptom of improvement, I've been laughing at my own jokes more, which sounds like it's fucking. Oh, so you're an egomaniac. No, I'm just enjoying the idea as like an independent thing, right? Like I'm having fun like me and this person are playing for lack of a better word. LIke we're just fucking around, like, like. So that to me is a symptom of feeling better and I also physical

Speaker 4:          01:37:05       please feel better. Wow. Okay. So the first one makes you feel better. Is there an increase every time you do it? Two through six. He didn't tell me. I, I'm betting there was. You mean an increase in dosage? I'm at an eight.

Speaker 3:          01:37:20       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Because I feel it would take me longer to get into the trip and then the hangover would be way less. Like I think last friday I didn't take a nap. Wow. Uh, in fact I know it didn't take a nap cause I got it at four and I had like an eight, 15. So I did. I was tripping from 4:15 to five and then figured out how to go and had a good set. Wow. yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:37:49       So is this something that you're going to have to repeat or is it supposed to be like you whack it out and point? Uh, the,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       the, how long it lasts is, is you know, various. Um, he said it could be few weeks, can be a few months. He did tell me, he said this will, these are the things that will make it last longer. Diet, exercise, obvious sleep. He said to sleep with the sun. It's like let wake up early if you can. Like. And another doctor told me that like, more serotonin is produced early in the day than, uh, than late.

Speaker 2:          01:38:23       So after the job is probabLy to wake early to rise. Yeah, that's basically like, that's better for your mental health. Keeps him helped. Um, so. So yeah, if like going to bed, what are you trying to wake up at? Seven or eight. But how are you going to go to bed early? You're a comic. I haven't yet. That's not going to work, right? Just going to be tired all the time. no, but I can go to bed. They're weeks, days during the week I go to bed at midnight or one. I do feel like there's ideas that are available to you when you wake up early in the morning that aren't available to you at any other time of the day. Like yeah, sometimes I forced myself to get up early in the morning just to sit down and write because I think sometimes I forced myself awake.

Speaker 2:          01:39:02       Like I'll set my alarm for six and then I'll get up and I'll sit in front of the computer at 6:30 AM all cloudy I'd but then somewhere on like six, 26, 45, six slash 15 slash 20 minutes later I start getting ideas. Yeah. And then they start coming out and then there's like, this is initial wake up and then the coffee hits in and is initial wakeup ideas I think are almost different because they're really connected to the sleep world. You were just sleeping just a small amount of time ago and you can't. You don't have defenses at that point. You can't be like stupid. You're just like, oh yeah, well that's one of the reasons why people like write like writing really silly shit late at night. Like the news radio writers, they didn't even start working until like 2:00 in the morning. I think that was mostly paul.

Speaker 2:          01:39:44       Yeah, paul, it was. Paul had been in his twenties and it was also a method to his madness. Like paul knew what he was doing and they would write the silliest shit cause they were barely awake. They were just like laughing. And I'd always heard that that show, they just play video games. That's mostly what the writers, they got me addicted. They had a local area network set up with computers playing quake on them and you would go there and we'd all played real time against each other and talk shit, laugh and oh my god, it was so addictive. I liked being up. That's the thing. It's not like I don't like getting up, but I like being a right, getting up as the hard part. forcing yourself to get up out of bed.

Speaker 3:          01:40:18       You know what? I have a thing on my phone that's really funny and like it's either for you or not. It's called. It's an app called. I can't wake up. Right, okay. It's an alarm clock. It goes off it like plays, music or whatever, chime or vibrates, whatever. In order to turn it off, you have to basically enter a code, so it's like a 25 or 30 character code caps numbers. Lower case takes fucking 55 seconds

Speaker 2:          01:40:50       and by the time you're done you're like, fucking, I'm up. Oh my god.

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       If you're doing that next to a girl, if you're dating a girl and she doesn't have to get up, she'd be so mad at you fucking asshole. He just out of the battery. Yeah, that's, it's really funny. And it works. Actually. I have no problem getting up. I don't like it, but I do it. Yeah. But I've, I grew up getting up every day because I had a paper route for the time. I Was like 17 till I was like 21, maybe even 22. Kept it until um, so I guess I'm used to just get up, get up, get up, get the other. So diet, exercise, get them with the sun. and um, it was interesting. Was at the fair talk therapy. Fun. Do you have a thing with therapy? I got so sick of talking. I was like, I need a physical cure. Like I know what the problems are.

Speaker 4:          01:41:46       I, I, it's not making me feel better. Like I, it's a, it's a fucking physical issue. I can, I promise you because that's pretty much been established, right? I mean it's pretty much established that are large majority of people or a large number of people that have depression. There iS a dip. There's a depleted amount of serotonin. yeah. Well, yes, that's established. Yes. As far as I'm concerned, it's established, but they don't really know. And there are certain therapies, cbt, cognitive behavioral therapy that works really well for people now. What do you do when you do that? I don't know because I haven't done it now. When you're, when you're getting, do you get measured? Like, do they measure your serotonin? They take your blood and they have. They don't have, they don't have a measurement for it. Whoa. Yeah. Um, look it up. But I don't, I've googled it because I've been like, how the fuck do I prove this?

Speaker 4:          01:42:40       But theY can't have serotonin syndrome. Right? Where you were taking five htp and an ssri and it gives you too much serotonin. It cAn really fuck with you. Yeah. So how do they know it's given you too much there? I think by the symptoms, um, seems like, it seems weird that they don't have a way of measuring what your levels are because can they originally level the dope? I mean, I don't think so. The brain is so fucking calm. Oh, they know nothing. They know nothing about it because it's impossible to. There's no. you know what I mean? It's like you can look at a heart. Most of it that's physical, it's just like blood, the thing, the liquid goes in, then it comes out. It's mechanical, whereas the brain is not mechanical will. one of the things that you brought up was Carl Hart, Dr. Carl Hart, and there's a lot of really brilliant people today that are trying to get people to understand addictions and what, what are the root cause of addiction.

Speaker 4:          01:43:31       And gabor montay had uh, some interesting stuff to say about that too in the movie the culture high and one of the main issues are talking about is that a lot of these people that are addicted that deal with addictions or people that are depressed and people that have like these moments in their life, they're trying to get over the hump there dealing with childhood abuse or their ge dealing with childhood stress or really trying to tell me I have ptsd. Yeah. A lot of therapists will minute will you had, you didn't have the easiest childhood? No, I think it's partially like my dad never hit me, but he used to beat the shit out of my brothers and I was like three, so I think that must have been like, yeah, traumatic. How could it not be? How could it not be, you know, I mean I can imagine that. I can't even imagine that. yeah, it was shitty. It's just a shitty way to. And then like there's so many kids, you don't get enough nutrients basically. Yeah. So. And they say like a lot of that,

Speaker 3:          01:44:29       a lot of serotonin levels are based on a. That early shit

Speaker 4:          01:44:34       can only. It only makes sense. Yeah. It only makes sense that your brain is programmed based on the experiences that it has to deal with. Yeah. And then if you're dealing with, that's one of the things they sAy about extremely violent neighborhoods. Kids that grow up in violent. Like michael irvin was telling me this, the kids that grow up in violent families and around violence, tHey'd literally from the womb, the mother as she's dealing with high cortisol levels and stress levels and adrenaline. Yes. The mother is programming the child from, from the time it's inside of our body to be more reactive, to explode till I feel like cortisol at an early age. I feel like killed serotonin. You know what I mean? I could be making that up, but it sounds right. So d, would you categorize what you're doing by having these experiences with ketamine? like a rewiring do you think you read? So that's what you're saying earlier. Think I'm cRazy, but there have been times in the last week,

Speaker 3:          01:45:31       um, where I can feel my brain physically not moving, but like adjusting, dealing

Speaker 4:          01:45:42       like maybe looks like certain amount of energy was inside that area, right?

Speaker 3:          01:45:46       He fucking knows what it is. Like theY know about like dendrites and fucking and nerve endings, all that shit. But they don't know About. They don't really know. They just know chemicals and the, and the synopsis that's. But they don't know exactly how they interact. Even. so I felt my brain is felt different. Physical and my sleep has been all over the place. One night I couldn't. I woke up at six and couldn't get back to sleep like, and then another day I slept till like 11 in the morning, you know what I mean? Or 11 and 12 like late. So it's been all over the place. which let you know, like there's an adjustment going on.

Speaker 4:          01:46:24       Do you get sun in your bedroom? Yeah. You don't sleep with curtains now closed. So when the sun comes in and you wake up. No, that's. Do it right now. We're supposed to do. That's. That goes to that waking up sunshine. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:46:38       Um, so, and the other thing, the other symptom that I feel like it's about as I've been writing more like fucking thank god.

Speaker 4:          01:46:46       Yeah. Thank you for not just writing more but being more productive with your writing. Yeah. Right. More productive with it. And you don't strike me as a guy who would be lazy, like not

Speaker 3:          01:46:56       no, but, but like, you know, I'm, I'm not, I'm not like, if I don't have an idea, I just don't. Right, right. I'm not one of these people like, nah, there's something funny about the sky, like let's figure it out. That's kind of how it's been for me.

Speaker 4:          01:47:11       I draw, I write entries, right? Like blog entries or essaYs and then I extract funny ideas from what I've been doing that I feel like if I sit down and just try to write joke, joke jokes, it's not my style. It's not the most effective way. Like I create a lot of like a pulp. There's a lot of nonsense. Don't fucking tell me about it, but I have accepted that as a part of the process that like mining. Yeah. LIke you don't just tap into a mountain and go, oh look, it's all gold, no gold mixed in with rock and bullshit and you got to find it. And again, I think some people are just better at distilling their shit or they are shit comes to the more distilled. But don't you think though that for me at least, almost all of it sucks until I bring it to the stage.

Speaker 4:          01:47:54       Like almost I have to find out what it really is. I have to like push it out in front of people. I got this new bit that I worked out last night for the first time ever died, ice house and as I was working in I was like, oh, finally. I know because I didn't know like before. I was like, is there something in this? I don't know if there's anything in this. That's the thing about comedy is you're never sure. Yeah. You never fucking sure. So I don't. I literally go on with this guy. I don't know. I, I see. If you ask me to bet I'd lose money a lot and then sometimes it's like a tagline as the funniest guy in the huge laugh and you're lIke, oh all right. Or a throwaway. I'll set it. Taking the credit. I'll take the current figure was where I thought. Do you think that that attitude that, that thinking about the credit, like what we're talking about before that was the boost that you got was you would get ego and you would get adrenaline. You wouldn't get the joy. Do you think that it's detrimental to concentrate on the credit? Do you think that it's better to achieve like a state? Yeah. well that's the thing of like, like

Speaker 3:          01:48:55       the thing I've said on here before, when me and david did the show, we wouldn't tell people who wrote what cause it was like, it's none of your business because you're just going to use it to judge. The person didn't write it, who didn't come up with it. So. So yeah, I don't, I, for whenever I'm with a group of people, if I'm writing in a room, my feeling is generally how it works with me is I don't pitch anything for awhile upfront and I'm like, dude, you fucking pissed. I'm pissed. I'm. And then by the end I've either caught up or beat most of the people, like because I, I just want to contribute, you know what I meAn? Like just I just want to contribute to the right. So, but the idea, I don't get to, I want to, I want to hold my own, but I'm not like I'm going to fucking vanquish these motherfuckers because it's comedy. It's like it's silly and like how you come up

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       with it as come so communal that it's, well in that sense, but I'm talking about in the sense of actually writing things for you, for you on stage. Not in the writer's room. We write for a sitcom or something like that. We're talking about like you coming up with the tagline out of nowhere and go, well, I'll take it. I still want credit for that. No, I'm kidding. I'm joking about it in that. I guess it's like the ego. It's just like, I didn't know that was thing. It's like the guy who invents, that happens a lot with pharmaceuticals actually. They think it's for high blood pressure and then it ends up being for, for. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, oh cool. But I Don't whether the credit thing I don't get too hung up with. I'm like glad that I came up with it, but I'm like, you were.

Speaker 1:          01:50:27       There's such, you know, chaff, like just fucking nothing. Yeah. And then it's what's nice is when you have a thought or like a long held idea about something and then eight years later you come with a joke for it. Yeah. And for me also, sometimes I find puzzle pieces and they, they're like little islands and also connect, click together and they have a bridge and then they become awesome. Like I know where I'm like, oh my god, you puzzle buddy. Come on now you're exciting. Now you're a part of a little little. Yeah. Continent. YeS. Not an island anymore. Yeah. Because after a while, if you have enough bits in your act, if you have like five or six ideas or eight or whatever, then you can just. You'll just end up filling up those eight more than like, I got to come with two more.

Speaker 1:          01:51:15       Just like the eight. Get longer. With this little puzzle pieces. Now, after doing these six treatments, do you anticipate this being like a quarterly thing that you do to just keep your, your brain charts in the state told me that there's a guy who does it once a month, whether he feels like it needs it or not. Um, by the way, I should say it's 600 bucks a treatment. Jesus. Yeah. So a lot of money. Yeah. So you are. But by the way, they were like, it's 3,500 bucks. I was like, I'll give you name your price if it's going to work, I'll give you half my life saving. I don't give a fuck. right. Like, it's none of this shit means anything if I'm not happy. Not only that, as an artist, as someone who is more productive, if you're happy. Yeah. It's worth a shitload of money.

Speaker 1:          01:51:59       Yeah. That's 100 percent true. And also more productive when your brain's working properly. How long has this gentleman been doing this? Um, didn't ask, but he has one guy, anesthesiologists, uh, he that by trade, he was an anesthesiologist. And uh, and, and by the way, it's also, it's approved by the fda. That's what's so crazy. The first thing I said when I came out of the trip, I go, I can't believe the fda approved that. How did they know? like, I, cause it works. It's like he said, it's like 70 to 80 percent of people that works with the depression with, with persistent depression, like persistent, kind of mildly untreatable depression. What if people aren't depressed? What about a guy like me? I don't know. Hm. I dunno know,

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       continue the monkey in which you fucking neurology there. Yogan. I mean they might, I don't think it'll fucks me up. I don't think it will fuck you up anymore than dmt or flipped me over there. I was scared or anything I was going to do iowasca. Um, and then the more I read about it, I was like, eh. It's like, what's my really throwing up for hours and fighting diarrhea. And then it alSo seemed like nebulous in terms of a, his, that what happens or not. I've only done dmt. I've done the pure extract, which is what would iowasca is a slow release version of dmt. Okay. So what happens is with dmt, they, they get it down to this freebase form. Just essentially they, they process it down to the rock crystals and you smoke that and you get pure dmt or the way rick strassman did it.

Speaker 4:          01:53:34       Rick strassman finally we rescheduled. His health is doing much better and he'll be here on august thing. He's going to be here in august. Um, uh, but he wrote a great book called dmt, the spirit molecule. It's basically, I made a documentary, right? Yeah. And I hosted the documentary. It's in my queue. Joe. Yeah, we'll go watch a beautiful. Um, and. But the, it was, it means you're connected to rick's work, but it was a lot of other experts and dennis mckenna on a lot of different people interviewed talking about the drug. But what he found, he had a, this is all fda approved as well. And if they did these trials out of the university of New Mexico where they gave people intravenous dmt, which is just like they're doing the intravenous ketamine with you, you know, boom, right into the bloodstream and longterm effect. Just like your experience.

Speaker 4:          01:54:22       Yeah, it's like a 45 minute trip as opposed to dmt, which is like 50 weed. You smoke it rather, which is like 15 minutes. So the aiw osca, what they've done is they've figured out a way to have dmt and mao inhibitor and natural mao inhibitor because monoamine oxidase, which is mao dissolve dmt in the gut. So if you try to take it orally, your body just breaks it down. And one of the reasons for that is a dmt exists in so many different plants that it was just orally active on its own. You would get high every time you get no salad, will you be tripping your balls off, you know, it just, it would be edible and it just, you'd be freaking out. You're there, your neurotransmitter levels would go through the fucking roof every time you eat vegetables. So he um, they figured out how to do it with, you know, they didn't know in a hospital setting, just like sort of a year to a doctor's office setting.

Speaker 4:          01:55:12       So like what you're doing and um, they had know really, really, really profound results with it to the point where it was really, really life changing shit for the people that were a part of it. Yeah. because it's just like a fucking, it's like having a law. It's like, you know, when you'd see boxers working with like a weighted vest, take the vesta. So that's what you feel like after you got out of there. Yeah. Take the vest off. YeAh. And he took the vest off more and more every time you did it. Yeah. And so the sixth one, after the sixth one's over, Describe what it's like the next day after the initial bay, smaller hangover

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       now because

Speaker 3:          01:55:45       hangover and just general. And I was taking that, like I said, the scores would go down. The um, the uh, it's called the bec, a questionnaire assumption. Um, and uh, and I just feel like I like my dog more dumb as shit, but it's like I write more, I laughed my own jokes more. I like my dog more. The other thing that he said, which I was going to mention of the things that will make it last longer. diet health, exercise. I'm a talk therapy and a close personal connection.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       So what he said, close personal connection with someone with someone with a love. Yeah. So I'm on the street, I'm out on the streets looking, looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for a candIdate, trying to make this, make this fucking make this ketamine last girl. Now what are you doing for exercise? A kettlebells and treadmill, which I always do. Um, so, but it's like one of those. Just a youtube kettlebell exercise regimen. Yeah. That's hard to motivate yourself. She'd go to your class. I don't. The thing is

Speaker 3:          01:57:04       I don't have a hard time. Like when I got my treadmill, my accountant's lIke, trust me, you're never going to use it. my clients get them. They're using. I was like, I'm irish catholic. Like, I'm fucking going to use it. Trust me. Like I will be like, no, you fucking you motherfucker. You will.

Speaker 1:          01:57:20       Well, I receiveD the a and shit like that question. You're, we'll say, listen, he's because he's an asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:57:26       Did that. When he. I invested in that tick, that laughs stub website that does the tickets for all the comedy clubs. I invested in it for five, six years ago and he's like, mom, I don't think it's. I quadrupled my money. It was like, by the way, my dad's a fucking lawyer. Like, I'm not a rube. My dad work was a tax lawyer. Like I'm not like, hey, wait. He when I invested in a restaurant recently, he's like, yeah, you can sit at the corner table. I'm like, I'm not doing it to sit at the fucking corner table. I'm doing it because I think it's a good thing.

Speaker 1:          01:58:01       You need a new accountant. He sounds like a negative nancy. he is. What a dick. Yeah. So, uh, if I had an account like that, I'd Be like, listen, fuck face. He's trying to. he's trying to be cautious. Yeah, cautious people are great, but not that cautious where you're getting cautious about a fucking treadmill. You micromanager. Yeah. Just let them buy the treadmill. Yeah. Let the kid have some fun. Let the kid ever fucking exercise equipment all the time. Um, and a kettlebell. Same thing. So you feel like a noticeable change when you have a good workout? Do you feel like elevated? You know, I am yet to get that. I didn't know at this point I just, I, because I wasn't

Speaker 4:          01:58:41       because I felt shitty and didn't exercise for like three weeks. I now I'm like fucking doing kettlebells and I'm like fuck afterwards just because I haven't, I'm out of shape basically. Right. So I'm in that like fucking jesus. So the three weeks while you were weaning yourself off of the drugs, the last couple months I just haven't had time to uh, to do that shit and I haven't been home and shit. So I'm so, but now that I'm back on it, I'm hoping I've never had a runner's high. You know what I mean? Really? Yeah, you gotta run it. I'm like, I've never had a runner's high. The fuck you talking about. They'll require sarah town. I think you've got to go deep to get a runner's high too. You've got to be exhausted. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a. I can't remember what the, what the mechanIsm is, why you get it.

Speaker 4:          01:59:25       It's like one of those things where your body thinks you're dying or something. My buddy cameron hanes just ran a fucking 24 hour run a mile track. Twenty four hours. He did 106 laps. He ran 106 miles in 24 hours. His legs swelled up twice. Their size. Feet are fucking bleed. He said videos on instagram of him than popping these, uh, blood volcanoes and his feet pop. It squirts up in the air. what did he do it for it to be an asshole so that everybody knows that he can run 100 miles. Body hoped out afterward. Like, I guess we're a hope now. Fuck it. Let's hook up. He pushes himself. He's really into pushing himself. You know, like testing is meant. Mental toughness. Testing is his mental boundaries because he ran 100, six miles fucking psycho. He's crazy. He's a professional bowhunter. He's a crazy guy.

Speaker 4:          02:00:17       Was it is? He saId no more. He regularly throws a hundred and 35 pound rock and his backpack and climbs up hills to simulate. Look what it's like the pack out meat when you're hunting because you got to these mountain hunters. Mountain hunting is incredibly difficult to do physically when you did. I've done it a couple times, but the climbing up was the most shocking. Like how tireD you get. Like I'm in shape, I work out all the time. I'll climb that mountain bitch. But he goes, it's like, holy fuck you if you. If you're not doing thAt specifically, like constantly climbing, you get fucking exhausted. So he gets an [inaudible] and then you miss out on opportunities and he's a professional. That's what he does. So he does it. He gets in shape literally for that and then along the way got addicted to getting in shape, you know?

Speaker 4:          02:01:05       And then you get addicted to results and addicted to perform them came to new. The other thing I was going to mention was the sense taking the ketamine. My recall has gotten better memory. Yeah. Because that's the. The thing that is sort of an unsung about depression. It fucks your memory up. Like you can't recall words. Well, it makes sense because memories increased by upping your neurotransmitters. Yeah. When you take nootropics, that's one of the things that we found when we did the double blind placebo studies on, at the boston center for memory with um, alpha brain. Was that one of the

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       big markers that had increased in his memory, memory and even reaction time, executive function, all those things. Yeah. You attaching to like, or the, the opposite of it. You were attaching to depressing this slowness is drag this weight.

Speaker 3:          02:01:54       Yet the other thing, last night, last two nights when I've been at clubs, I remember everyone's name normally. I'm like, I, I don't, I think I know your name. I couldn't tell you what it is. Like I could see their name next to their face. Um, switch again, just the weird thing that you don't think about. And then when it happened, like fucking. okay, good. I thought my memory's fucked up.

Speaker 2:          02:02:17       If I couldn't remember how. I used to think of you when I first met you, like way back at the boston comedy club, you would never like jovial. You never like well, like real happy. Cool. We're always, we always were friendly to each other and throw the ball around a little. Yeah. But you know what I'm saying, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:02:36       but I was a kid, I was like that. THere was a picture of me as a baby one or one and a half and I'm like literally staring at the Picture, like staring at the camera and chappelle goes. And you've had that look on your face ever since. Yeah. You were always kind of stoic. Yeah. And it's not in. The thing is, it's like the other thing, it sucks going through life going like I know there's something better. I know there's something, I don't want to be like this. Like I know that there is a. I know if I wasn't like this, life would be more enjoyable and like, and I know it's not, you know, it's the thing with depression is a lot of times people think it's just like, oh, well you don't look. And it's like when Henry Rollins said fucking can't believe robin williams killed himself, it's like, well then you don't fucking understand depression dickhead. It's not like getting lung cancer because you didn't even breathe. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:03:28       He's got that Whole suck it up attitude down pat. Yeah. But I don't, I, I can't subscribe to that. I, I've known way too many people that have had like real fucking problems with it and I think it can be adjusted with the behavior modifications, the way you treat people, the way you interface with people with exercise, with diet a little bit. There's a lot going on, but some people, man, it's not enough. Some people are still fucking depressed. Yeah. YeaH.

Speaker 3:          02:03:57       That's. I've gone to therapy fucking 15 years already. Said mushrooms helped him a lot. Yeah. There's a lot of people say lIke mushrooms, they're trying to. They're mushrooms is in this whole ketamine, a bogus goba he bogus. I'm abigail. I've ibogaine. Yeah, but the extracts, um, I will ask, uh, all that shit. Um, there's a thing in, in south America they can go or Costa Rica that it's like an ego but an ibogaine retreat and you see there are videos on this retreat thing. You see a guy transform it a week and it's not fake. Right? You can see it in his carriage and his eyes. It's amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       Um, so yeah, I think some people just like, you got to fucking hard to a hard restart. Yeah. Hard restarts are great for phones and people. Yeah. which brings me to the samsung galaxy s six. You know, when you do the math, it's simple. Six is greater than six. What is that? One of the asset is being beach do punch up on that, but they don't. I can't pick what they pick. They should listen to you. I think they're popular though. They may, sometimes they're very popular, But like the, I think the ads are properly, so I can't argue with them. Well, let's just follow those ads on youtube. It just on tHe, in the comments. It's just everyday. It's just apple. Samsung, apple said, fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck. It's like, dude, you got it. This can't be that important. Well, people get hung up on brands so hard.

Speaker 1:          02:05:30       You know? I've had people that I've talked to that say I'll never buy a ford. I'm a fucking chevy guy. You know, like what is wrong with you? Yeah, like how would I don't buy apple, dude. I'm a windows guy. Okay. Jesus christ. It would. If all of a sudden apple comes up with the greatest thing ever, you're going to stick to your guns because they trick you into. Because it's not about the product. It hasn't been about the product and advertising for 20, 30 years. It's about the cultural meaning of the thing with especially big brands. Especially. That's why like sneaker companies and Chile that once they go south, once they are for losers. Good. Forget it. Forget it. Good luck. Once you see one homeless guy wearing them and I'm talking to. I'm talking to you and one once. She's. What? I would see any like once you see or like penn one had a day in the sun, but it's only two years.

Speaker 1:          02:06:22       Yeah, but this homeless guy, I don't know. It's interesting that I'm sure it's interesting. They fucked up their brand. Yeah. What other brands would you say are inexorable and unfixable pony in the eighties? Ponies back though. Date? No, they tried. Puma. Puma is a little shaky for they will. There are some that kind of classic. Some are european companies like uh, I think nike owns converse and I think adidas and puma converse all stars never stopped. I never went to whenever they hung in there just by the fact that it's not expensive and bad ass fucking sneaker. They just, they're new, they're new. They're like stylish enough and neutral enough. Yeah. They don't call, they don't go on and on about it, you know what I mean? Chuck's all day. So then there's like a bunch of other companies that are like new balance. I'm not sure.

Speaker 1:          02:07:14       Yeah. Well new balance. Some of them are just for runners, like some are just like a [inaudible] oh yeah, new balance. What about a deed? Brooks? Apparently mrs. Always going to have a certain like shell tops are always going to have a certain amount of class. Yeah. My. And now he's got nike's got the uh, the, the pro athlete angle. Yeah. But they've got like the, the fucking, the like the super one that's been like cool. That blank dates where the clean ones. My white, the clean ones. I can't think of the name of it. Do you request in your rider a new pair of sneakers with every show that you did? I do not like eddie griffin. Yes. If that shoe sneaker. It's the white air force one. Air force wants. Thank you very much. So white air force ones they've Liked. That's a perennIal for them.

Speaker 1:          02:08:00       A perennial. Yeah. And the, the other one is the uh, the fucking air. It's got the, it was the first one in the bubble when it used to be timberland's air max air max. That is coRrect. Remember when it used to be timberlands? Timberlands with no laces. And I remember I was just there. Joe, what? What happened? That wasn't jovial. Didn't work. Now in certain areas I didn't know, they never went out. They never went out in certain areas. They'd never went. I it like doc martens with depressed white people. That is correct. Doc martens until there was a, a big part of the depressed pump. Wells. Angry. Yeah. they want to be from liverpool. NoT talking to your parents that thought my parents were doing heroin, putting my shoes. I'll be on st marks if anyone needs me at doc martens or a weird one.

Speaker 1:          02:08:48       Like if you wore a doc martens, you basically look giving up on the rest of the society and they're not good looking. They started like skinheads made them popular, like they were like big in the skinhead community and then they kind of took off from there. It's like, are we share? Will he represented like a certain aesthetic like person who's just not following the norm? You want dark things? Clouds? Yes. Yeah. Safety pins and your clothes. Like the johnny rotten and malcolm mclaren shit. Yeah. Please. Shelf up by your bootstraps. Is kevin kevin? These fucking weirdos? Yeah. Um, Yeah. So, uh, so yeah, I've got to say so far so good with the ketamine, like it's. No, that's great to hear that you've found something that's an actual solution. yeah. That at least in this one run I've had, have had people have um, have people had an issue similar to way you were saying that these ssri is, they would work for a little while, then they stop working.

Speaker 1:          02:09:48       Have people had an issue with like this with ketamine? I think they've, my feeling personally is like at a certain point I'll do something else but um, but I don't think it's a matter of quitting. I don't know what would have. I don't think it would be like the ssri thing is your eight chemicals leaving your body. That's the withdrawal, which creates like any drug withdrawal. It's just your body's trying to compensate. I'm with this. There's no, there's no ketamine in me now to speak of. I guess there's, maybe ketamine creates something in your brain that whatever. So. Well, that's one of the weirdest things about some psychedelic trips as you feel like there's rewiring going on, you feel that with like they're working in your brain, like you see them peripherally and you're looking at you going like doing some shit off to the side.

Speaker 1:          02:10:39       That's what I mean. It's like going back saturday. Right. And you're just like, oh fuck, this is the. Oh, go. Hey guys, how are you? Will you, I think you're saying, wait if correct me if I'm wrong, but what you're seeing is like the roots of where your behavior is coming from when you're saying that you see their wiring under the board. Uh, yeah, I just see more like the board, the board itself. Yeah. And not necessarily like, oh, see your childhood, the lever. Do you see your child and much see you in the current state? I don't, I don't really see. I, it was a pov, um, we all know pov from porn as a pov shot of me basically laying in the same position as I was on the bed, which is just like, you know, sitting up in the bed. So it was just me basically at one point it became like a little rollercoaster, like, but a fun kind of smooth like water ride.

Speaker 1:          02:11:34       Um, but it's just me kind of going through different things. Um, and some of the times it was just like white blob, you know, just like, and you go into it with a mindset where you're trying to cure your depression or you're trying to eliminate it or mitigate it or like I didn't. Yeah. I was like, I'm just hopeful. Right. Um, but why you're having these experiences while you're on the water slide. Is this a theme I thinking I'm, are You just experiencing just kind of nice and nice feeling and then it's time. So it'd be like, oh fuck, I'm in santa monica, I'm trYing to treat depression. Wow. And you would think that while you're in the middle of the trip? Yes. Wow. Yeah. And the other thing iS you could, I could hear the doctors sometimes he'd be talking. Oh, but there was a nurse watching it the whole time.

Speaker 1:          02:12:24       A nurse she got, she's super fucking hunt. Stephanie if you Listen. She was cute. Yeah. Jo, she was, she, where the pov came in handy. She's got a corset on. Yeah, I'm, the associate was watching. She just watches you and I was like, hey, would you videotape me? And she was like, yeah. And then I got up and she's like, you didn't do anything. So it wasn't really the point, but I'm supposed to catch me while I'm under. So let's say this is be under. Yeah, a couple of times. Got her own artistic skill around fucking, you know, how they get cut down there. So, uh, so yeah, so there's a nurse watching you and then there was, they also use ketamine for pain management. If people have had chronic pain that they can't Get rid of. Real they. Yeah. Ketamine treatment. Why my academy for that? The same fucking thing. Something's going on. Yeah. The not knowing why it's effective is very strange. Yeah. And the dosage, my understanding is the dosage is way less than people would take on the street. And the fact that it's Weightless. The people taking the street and I Was still fucking tripping my balls off is, I don't know what happens on the street. will the street ones they're taking, they're

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       snorting it or they're smoking it. Oh. So it's less so maybe it gets cut down by the body. Oh god. I imagine it's getting processed by your stomach. You know, it's going through your, your organs and all that jazz. You're just shooting it right into your blood. You probably need way less. Yeah. Um, so. So yeah. So you should look into lily looking at john lilley because he really was a fucking nut for ketamine. He became addicted to it. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. Well he apparently was, I can't imagine getting addicted to it because it's pretty. I know another guy got a color to it, like was it a club day? Well, A guy who was into it as a club drug, he got addicted to it and came out here. A buddy of mine took him out here to rehab. He was a fighter.

Speaker 4:          02:14:16       Took him out to a. There's a place in thousand oaks. It's a rehab place that's um, that specializes or did specialize in the early two thousands, specialize in ketamine and he wound up dying from it. He died from withdrawal or overdose, drug overdose, whatever kind of drug. Who knows if it was ketamine or a bunch of other things with ketamine. But he had a real ketamine problem. So ketamine, like recreationally, I didn't know to. I wouldn't. It was like, you can't fucking trip [inaudible]. I wouldn't want it. It's like, what do you want to do? Shrooms every day. some people would, but it's like everything else. Like, you know, should you be able to get a tattoo? Yeah, of course. Well, some people want a tattoo every part of their body, including their eyeballs. Okay. Well that's not me, but yeah, it, as long as I can say I want to have a sleeve.

Speaker 4:          02:15:06       I can't stop some guy from turning his eyeballs into towed from thex man or whatever the fuck he's doing. His name wasn't towed or something like that. Frog fuck's his name of wolverine. The froggy guy. I don't think there was a frog and eczema. What was he? The guy With the fucking tail? Nightcrawler. Another. There was nightcrawler and there was another guy that was like a toad. Whatever. You know what I'm saying? It's crazy to wes borland looking black eyes. I wouldn't, I have, would have no interest in doing this. I would like to do it a little. Is that a different one? Was that one? That's a different one. So that's not, that's not the frog. That's not the one I was talking about. Well, who the fuck is that? That's the frog. I was talking about the. Oh, you're talking about somebody else got a guy who's up there.

Speaker 4:          02:15:54       The other guY is the guy with that guy right there. The guy to the left of that. The other guy. That guy. Yeah. Oh, all right. yeah, that's what he looked like. All right. Whatever. um, yeah, I don't, I couldn't imagine doing it every. It was pleasant but it wasn't that pleasant because the hangovers. Not like I hate that fucking feeling coming out of anesthesia. Like I had a septum surgery and I'm the guy didn't take out enough shit, but that's a whole other thing. But when I came out of it, um, it was in New York like a nine years ago when I came out of it, it was the fucking worst feeling

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       coming out of anesthesia and I couldn't breathe. I was like, can I please get some water? And she was like, we can't give you water. So it's that thing where they're like, mr ron investment, it's just like this jarring fucking thing or they're trying to wake you up. And I was like, please. And she's like, I'm giving you an ice cube. She gave me an ice cube, I hocked up a fucking blood pellet. That was like, well, what if I hadn't asked for that shit? Like I couldn't. It was dangerous. Um, so You had swallowed like clot basically. Yeah. In a clot, like blood booger was pictures on twitter after I got my deviated septum done while I was blowing out these fucking silver dollar size hunks of blood and bulger. Ooh, you got enough meat. They guy didn't taken enough. Meet up. Yeah, my guy was awesome.

Speaker 1:          02:17:14       He did a great job. I almost want to get it again. Get it again. All right, I love it man. Now that I've come out of the fucking ketamine, maybe I can double up having nose, nose breathing, being able to breathe through my nose that I didn't get that. So it was like 40 or 39. I think I had it. I still can't really breathe that in one of my. Yeah. For me it's magic. Can you imagine the kind of shape I'd been fired. I'm terrified. Fucking fucking guy. You guys got to know what to do. Well, it's just nice to be able to breathe just to be able to breathe in your nose with your mouth closed. That was a mouth breather most of my life, but I apparently it's not an easy surgery and some people just, it doesn't work right on them, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:17:57       And some people grow back. That's the other thing I heard you goes back to it. I've heard it just repeats. Know mine hasn't. Okay. Milo on seven years, so it's amazing. Yeah. They, they trim your turbinates. I think they're called those big bones in there and they also cut out a lot of calcified blood on me. Oh really? Yeah, mine was all like they. There was like an extra that goes like I don't think you need anything, and then he showed he did like the x ray and it. There was so much like cartilage or whatever it was. It was like it was cinnamon buns to fit. Oh god. So I guess he took that uP, but he didn't take out enough shit. They say that there's a large percentage of people that deal with block septums that it's super confident because your nose is so fragile.

Speaker 1:          02:18:46       You whacked it on a door and all of a sudden it's bent and now you don't breathe right for the rest of your life. So you get an operation. The I've heard whether it's true or not, but like a lot of it has to do with inbreeding. I really have. I've heard the jewish people and irish people have fucked up noses from inbreeding. Really? Where'd you read that? In fucking on reddit, bro. Where do you think I bucket or it? Well, you know how fighters get cauliflower ear? Yeah, rough. They get that with their nose as well. You get it with your nose, the inside of your nose. Yeah. The inside is soft tissue inside your nose, bleeds and swells and fills with blood and that blood hardens and calcifies and there's nothing you can kind of get in there and scrape it out. Got to get an operation if you don't do anything for cauliflower ear. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:19:27       yeah. The cut, the cut the ear, they flay it open and then they scrape out all the calcification and stitch it right by the ear. Yeah. It's just blood that becomes calcified when blood leaks, like when you have breaks in the blood vessels apparently, and it's under the surface of the skin. It swells up, like fills up with blood and then that blood hardens and becomes like calcium.

Speaker 3:          02:19:52       I, uh, someone I know was telling me that they woke up with vertigo and it turned out, um, because a friend of hers had had it for months and they go, yeah, it turned out it was just a piece of dust in my inner ear. So basicaLly if you ever wake up with vertigo, one of the ways you get rid of it is literally like trying to get water out of your head. You're trying to just jar the dust or whatever it is. I'm like somersaults, fucking laying on your side. I swear to god they was like, somersaults is one of the cures. Um, so if anyone wakes up with vertigo, get to.

Speaker 4:          02:20:33       Was it that your ears control your balance? Like some of her nose, your ears and your balance are connected. Yeah. And your nose and your taste buds are connected. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck is going on with the human design. What a shit design. And you're on the outside. Yeah. And every time. No god you come, you can make a person. Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's too wild. It's ridiculous. Trick. Trick us. Yes. So, uh, so yeah, tricks. So I'm, look, man, I'm happy to hear that. You know, this is really working for you. Yeah. I'm still not.

Speaker 3:          02:21:08       I think I'm still not. I'm hoping that I have maYbe 30 more percent upside to go more room. I think it with the ssri stuff like once then completely dissipates. Yeah. But I'm like, it's more enjoyAble from the pov than it was. Would you recommend this to other people? Do you recommend? I wouldn't, you know, recommending a medical treatment. It's, it's personal, but if you feel like all I can tell you is I tried a bunch of shit and it's. And it's true. The reason they do ketamine, there's another one called tms, which is the magnetic one. There's a guy in chicago who does both at the same time cheats us prices guys. A mad man. Fuck You. Trying to do like a superman and uh, he might've. So Yeah. So, uh, you're the doctor. I'm so you. Yeah, I, I, yeah, there's a bunch of shit and it's like if you're just sick of it, I was just sick enough of it that I was like, I don't name the price named the hardship because there's nothing.

Speaker 3:          02:22:15       I'm just sick of it. Well, you know, kudos to you for keeping. Keep searching. The transcranial magnetic stimulation is covered by some. With magnets on your head. Yes. And they don't know how it works, but they got it. And I was on a show the other night, by the way, it was like a science show, science slash comedy show, like the panelists that were scientists panels over comics. A woman on the panel, um, has, she's involved in a magnet thing that increases people's sex drive for ever fucking chicks. Yeah. Shoot magnets and your way. Hornier. And I was like, do you think who? But I said, I don't think men need it. Right? Because the judge fuck your life. The idea is you give it to women. Yeah. Like it's a spanish fly and magnet basically. Yeah. So while you check is asleep, he put a fucking kitchen magnets out, joe people online that was saying they can make it at home. Not the, not the sex one, but the transcranial one. But um, well there's been all sorts of magnetic pulse to ease depression. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. What does It say?

Speaker 2:          02:23:29       Noninvasive procedure to help fight depression called transcranial magnetic stimulation or tms uses magnetic pulse to stimulate brain cells that control moot, but they use that transcranial stimulation for a lot of different shit. Right? There Was a, not magnetics but electric. They were. They had these electrodes they were attaching to people's brains that helped them learn shit quicker. There's all sorts of weird little hacks that you can use that helps stimulate little areas of the brain that they covered on radio lab. There was a radio lab episode about this woman who went through a sniper school tests when I heard that one. you see that one? Yeah. That one was a main. Or listen to that one. That one was amazing because she did it and then she did it the second time and she's like, everything was in slow motion. I feel. Felt like it only took five minutes and it was 20 minutes later,

Speaker 3:          02:24:15       the eight. A zone the zone now. so, uh, it's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:24:22       I love this. I love that there's so many people working on all these different ways to improve the way the brain functions and they're kind of still in this infancy with it. They're fucking with it and adding pills.

Speaker 3:          02:24:31       I'm grateful for the shit they've done so far. It's like fucking thank you. Even for the pills that didn't work.

Speaker 2:          02:24:37       Trying. Yeah. That's really cool. I've never had a depression issue. I don't think. I mean I think I might've when I was really young, but I don't have it. I definitely don't have it now, but I, I sympathize with it and I know a lot of people who have had it and I know a lot of people have had it and they've come back and they're much better. You know, our fears. One that I always point to ari was severely depressed at one point in time and you know, and now he's just amazing. He's happiest fucker. I know. From what terms you think that a lot to do with it. Success had a lot to do with it or he's really successful now and you know, he doesn't feel like he's on the outside anymore. He's not, he felt like, I think for awhile like that he wasn't being recognized, he was being recognized by us, you know, like all of our friends and like crowds would laugh at them but the industry doesn't take them or he wasn't.

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       YeAh, I had another brain thing over two days. I think it was earlier this week, um, where one day I was like, fucking no one cares about you and the next day I like, it was a professional gripe, warm legacy field, getting, doing good enough it to all that shit. And then the next day I had the same thought and then it was followed by like will then fight, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, like yeah, it was like then fucking do something about it. Whereas the day before I was just like hopeless. Like that's the thing is like one of the depression thinks just like learned helplessness is a sin. They think that was one of the things that like that was a behavioral thing where it's like you have to like when, when mice couldn't, when they realized they couldn't get out of a box, they just stopped trying, but then there were certain meds that they gave I think a chemical to that would keep, that would like just fight, fight, fight, fight until he died. but they. But that was the thing of like, okay, like I wasn't getting out a month ago.

Speaker 2:          02:26:21       That learned vIctim mentality is that that's a, a groove that's like carved in people and some people it's become so prominent. Yeah. They just automatically drop right into that. And then they're a victim. Yeah. And they search for that and then they use it. Look for situations. I also use it in arguments, like they become a victim in the argument. It's super common and it's so self defeating, but so it's so enormous part of really weak thinking.

Speaker 3:          02:26:49       Yeah. But having said that, a lot of some of week thinking is as chemical problem is fucking diabetes. Yeah. You know what I mean? Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:27:00       And also, not everybody has the same exact fuckIng childhood and growing up experiences. So your, your formative experiences that you're having with it's shaping your personality, what giant percentage of them are completely out of your control and how arrogant is it to assume that everybody had the experiences that you had. So you've gotten through them. Everybody else, Henry Rollins needs to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and not fucking shoot themselves. Like robin williams, that pussy fucking pussy. Yeah, I mean that's the crazy. Well that's like when people say it

Speaker 3:          02:27:29       like a, a, a depression is like a strength thing. It's like if you're talking about mental fortitude, I've got a pretty good track record of like shit I've done. and same with robin williams talking about fucking not easy. What he's done. Fucking write however many hours to stand up. He stole a ton of stand up to be that good inactive to being just his recall was fucking a like. He's got a good brain so he's not like a week at

Speaker 2:          02:27:58       some things. At least you know Mark Gordon, who's a good friend of mine, is a doctor. He's an expert in traumatic brain injury and recovery from traumatic brain injury and one of the things that he talked about, he actually wrote a paper about this, about people that have gone through very significant operations where they have been under anesthesia for long periods of time and had open heart. That type of shit.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       There's a large percentage of them that experience and pretty significant depression after it's over and they think it has to do with hormonal imbalances that occur after these traumatic. Yeah. That, but some people have like a kind of. Seems like letterman had the opposite, like he had heart surgery and was like a new man. He was just appreciative and shit like that. Well, that's true too. You know, some people that go through these near la near death experiences and wakes them up like they realize, hey asshole, this is almost over. Maybe it's time to be nice to people. Yeah. Maybe appreciate, smell the flowers. You're fucking. David letterman did go out and hug some folks, you know? Yeah. That's. He'd started taking antidepressants. did he really? Yeah, he was on alec baldwin's podcast. He talked about it like alec baldwin as a pilot, baldwin hat. He had a podcast.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       I don't know if it came back. That guy's got golden pipes, first of all. So that's the way he talks. A joy what you're saying. This is alec baldwin. I'm like, it's a joy to listen to that puck. That's an easy hour, right? There's ego. It was fucking try to fucking like, don't pay attention to that part. You'll listen to fucking golden. But I'll take an ego with pipes like that. What have you have? Puffer razzi. Would you hold a grudge? Yeah, I think that's what made him, it was on a public radio station in New York and they were like, you can't be saying faggot and all that, like, sorry man, I can't say I can't do it. But uh, but yeah, so he was talking about on, on, on alex pod podcast and it was like, he went on him shortly after that. I think he had shingles too, and he was just miserable.

Speaker 1:          02:29:54       Uh, and they were like going in and he's like, really? And he said like, it's, I don't know what the analogy was, but he's like, it was just like, it was like I'd clumpy hair that I couldn't get a comb through and now I could get the comfort with or something. I don't remember what the, but some similar to that, but he's kind of chubby and it doesn't go. you exercises and I bet he doesn't eat letterman. No, no. I'm taLking about letterman, letterman, letterman would talked about it. Ios podcast, not on antidepressants. These podcasts. Oh, okay. Well, letterman also, this is post open heart surgery. Yeah, that makes sense. But I'd heard stories about him where he was, you know, I'd hear stories where he wouldn't be happy with the monologue. And he used to be banging his head against the wall. Yeah, I heard that too.

Speaker 1:          02:30:34       I heard that from my friend who's his assistant. Yeah. He fucking hated everything he did. and that's one of the reasons why he was the best. Yeah. It's just the way it is. Yeah, he would. Yeah. There's a, there was a story in that, uh, in that late night book, the late shift that I think it was in the book, but Peter Le sally had a big house in malibu and he was the exec producer of the tonight show and like an exec producer on late night with david letterman and he became one on the new one too, but, so he was sort of like, letterman's go between for letter for uh, for johnny and uh, he had a beautiful rooms like, man, I could never have a house like this. And he goes, you make 10 times the money I make, like you could totally. And he's Like, really? Like, it just never occurred to him that things were good and he could do well. Another thing more. I'm more apt to cry now as well in a good way. Not like, like I saw inside out and cried, which isn't good. Yeah. Sweet. but uh, but like, so you feel more? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:31:40       Yes. Wow. Yeah. So far

Speaker 1:          02:31:43       I'm happy for you to get addicted and die. I think that's awesome. I'm happy for you coming on here and talking about it because it's fucking because the thing with therapy that it's very, first of all, people don't know. It's very hard to find a good therapist. Like people are too quick to go, like, yeah, they're fine. You got to shop around which people don't realize and with the antidepressants you gotta shop around and if none of them work, keep looking for other shit. Like don't just go and you can't do it. Um, so. So yeah. But uh, I look forward to the rest of my life, jo. I look forward to hanging out with you, neil brennan. You're a bad motherfucker. Thanks. but I appreciate it. I appreciate you coming on. I appreciate you talking about this.
