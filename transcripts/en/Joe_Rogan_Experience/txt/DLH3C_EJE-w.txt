Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Or live that always sounds so fake, so it was hard to get these things started, so he's hard to just just start talking. Not Hard, but I'm learning from you that the way you define things in your own mind. A language. Yeah. Language they use. Yeah. The way you define things can oftentimes shape exactly how those things manifest themselves in real life. Right? Yeah. You say more about yourself and what you actually know. Not Swear. Mind coaching comes in. You say more about yourself. You give away a law. He did. He went. Sometimes it doesn't make sense. The talking about something and they saying that they're really positive about something and then you think, well that doesn't match up. So it's a bit like I'm a barking peg. Pigs don't bog. It just makes sense. That's how I defined it anyway. A barking when I had to throw through the filter more fuckers.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       You're talking about cheap mushroom days, I'm afraid. Yeah, it's a, there's a very interesting thing we just did, we just did something called timeline therapy that you, uh, were telling me about. The Joe Schilling told me about Ian Mccall. Got really interested in it, um, and what you would use if for folks who've never heard of any before, but he's been on the podcast before Vinnie's, a mental coach and a hypnotist, and before our first session, the last time you came on the podcast, I was like, well, I don't know about all this hypnosis stuff. Maybe just a bunch of fucking crazy people and people talk to them and I mean, you for sure have seen those televangelists that put their hands on people and they'd go into spasms and they fall down on the floor and they claim to be curative. Illnesses. Hysteria, isn't it? What is that makes the Hallux politics bullshit?

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Or is it something going on with some of those? Pinkus is a hypnotic state. It doesn't mean that it's, it's a positive one, but as a hypnotic state, they get this. Anyone that does that, I've been on a couple of podcasts now, went on the two with a cold, the dash radio story time with uncle creepy. And the first thing of that interview is set. Obviously a huge tip. No, he. So looking at, you know, I can't be hypnotized, we'll find out. So. Right. You know what I mean? People love to say that though I can't be hypnotized, bro. Come get me Bro. I don't care. Fine. I mean, I think we may have discussed this the last time, but we may not have. I think stand up comedy is hypnosis. They. So you know what everything is. These algae, you're not in a hypnotic state listening to you, Nazi state, not listened to. Music, TV, having a bath, shower, rituals, whatever. So do you think that the term hypnotic is problematic because people think that it takes away control from you and it puts you into this Netherworld or something like that. Can Do. But I'll hypnosis itself. Hypnosis. So you do it yourself. I'm only a potion of inflammation as my first teacher said Keith Mayer and it went to Liverpool football club. Great Guy. Uh, he said that

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       we're only post one of information. So we just guide the way and show the Pearson which way to go, you know? Yeah. It for the ICT said last time, I don't do for all. Look at him and on, you know, like that. I mean it's fine if you want to go with show and you want to getting involved in that and way, great. You won't have sex of the chair or whatever. That's okay for me. Yeah, I do. I don't do it for you. What do you do it for 'em? I do because I liked people succeed and I know it sounds cliche and very hippy, but I love it. I like people doing well. I like, I like he section as some sort of weird noble side of me really. I think when people conquer fear, when people conquer something, nothing. There's nothing bad in there.

Speaker 3:          00:03:42       Well, I think one of the things that we talked about when we were doing a timeline, I was talking about some of my experiences when I was younger that have kinda like clung to me unfortunately or fortunately in and you know, you were, you were talking about your own and I think that when you've had some bad experiences in your life and when you've had some things in your mind that stand out as a very memorable moments and points in your life, those things can kind of, they don't just define you, but that also can set you up for the future. Like how you think about other people or how you think about other things, shapes your life completely and having these bad moments and realizing what they were and how they defined you now gives you motivation to help other people get over their bad moments.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       Yeah. It's just with time line therapy, which is devised by. I'm Tad James and uh, um, a very, very successful guy at Saint James Company. My teacher work for them directly calling MCI. So I'm a direct descendant. Really have that. The technique is amazing. I mean, I love it and I said to you earlier, I believe everyone in the world should do it and that's not a sales pitch by the way. That's just my opinion. You know, I just think it's fabulous. You know, people have things going on, like let's say you've got an iphone six or an iphone or whatever. If you don't use the APPS, keep playing over and over again. If that's still going on, they are going to take some sort of toll on you when you shut them down and think, well actually she'll sit down and you save your battery and memory and the shapes your life.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       You know what? I've been saying that for awhile. It turns out it doesn't. Somebody just. Some dude just tweeted me. Yeah. It's not like a computer where the computer is constantly has these things running in the background and it's using up resources and battery power. Apparently with phones it does not do that.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       Malacca d fragmentation. You're on an old computer when you do frog it that then instead that's my app saying, God, I want it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:34       I did too. I used to use that as an example, but some, some dude who actually knows what he's talking about correcting me, which is taking over Internet. Oh, we, we cannot, we must plow for it except our defeats let's say now it's ruined. Yeah. Um, but I think that, you know, your, um, your own personal experiences is one of the reasons why you've become a coach, not a mind coach, but a martial arts coach and that these experiences of negative moments in your life where you've overcome them and you realize I can help someone else who is in that sort of same situation. Yeah, of course.

Speaker 2:          00:06:08       It's just like he's just, it's nice to just say it's a, it's not that important. You know, people believe that these sometimes. I mean the got, there is problems that are massive, you know, I'm not gonna lie in some things I can't solve. I'm not Moses. But um, there is the risk things that, you know, if you can help somebody out and they can get rid of it or change the way they think. I ego schilling money did sign my therapy. His relationship with his dad was miles better before he passed away. Isn't that pretty powerful?

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       Yeah. Joe talked about it on the podcast. He talked about it just completely changed his whole perception of his relationship with his dad, who his dad was in his life and he let it all go.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       Yeah. I just helped him tremendously. What more can you say that, that really as a coach me and had said, you know, no, they didn't get a fight with Justin scoggins and that because of the weight, whatever her name was saying that his life has changed since doing timeline therapy and doing the, you know, work with me not just timeline therapy and not just hypnosis with my coach and in general because it's multifaceted. Rarely. And um, he said his lives changed. He, he's a different person. People have noticed, you know, so that's for me, great news.

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       I think sometimes it just takes the realization of what's been fucking with you that once you realize what it is, then you have it in your mind and then you can kind of look at it for what it really is instead of this thing that's playing in the background that you can't quite identify or you or you know it exists, but you ignore it and you just. You don't. You don't ever get over it. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:37       He sees he's interested in either a client the other week called joy. She's 80 years of age and she was going to a wedding in Spain for her grandson and she was beside herself. She was terrified, you know, and we did it. Just a few things, you know, little things to make you consider different ways of looking at the anxiety she was getting. Anxiety is basically a massive with your unconscious mind is to focus on what you want because if you're in an anxious state, you focus in on what you don't want, right? There's different levels of it. Of course, when she was focusing on what may go wrong, seller saying all this will go into a wedding is a celebration of two People's matrimony, whatever, and it's going to be nice and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. She wasn't focused on that. We've spoken to something else. I changed that and like she was happy and she went to the wedding and so now he's got, I mean, she's 80 years of age. You may not be going to Lowe's a wedding, let's be honest. But if, for me, the job itself, what can you say about nice transforms people, you know, and I, I

Speaker 3:          00:08:33       adora no, I know you do. I really, you really, it comes out of you when you do it. You really do love it. Um, it's, uh, it seems to me that human beings don't really live long enough to figure out what this is. You know, I think that is one of the major problems that a lot of us have. We have a certain amount of momentum that comes from our childhood, whether it's

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       good or bad. And we followed that momentum into our adulthood. Sometimes trying to hit the break, sometimes trying to correct the course and oftentimes using things like alcohol or drugs or gambling or anything to distract us from the pain of whatever, the instability, whatever, whatever it is, it's fucking with us. And then you get to be a certain age. You realize like, I'm barely figuring this thing out and I'm almost dead. You know, it's the last thing. He's signing all the papers on the year on pass know we should do. Yeah, you definitely don't want that. But you also, you, I think there's a big thing that people always talk about, like living in the moment. It is a very, it's a very difficult thing to do for some strange reason. Yeah. Because you know, you worried about Somara yeah. Like worried about light around or you're worried about yesterday, yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       Worried about last year. That's why it Easter. I'm, I'm not gonna pretend to walk in a cloud, you know, and, and trying to come in with all these long statements and write these things. You know, it's no one does, but that's towson. But that's a problem with religion, right? With religion. To do that, one of the bigger issues is that the people that are sort of proselytizing or the people that are promoting it there in some ways, many of them, especially priests and things along those lines, which is why it's so disappointing when you hear about child sex abuse, monks, priests, they're pretending to be something holy and special and above you, which is why they can bestow this knowledge upon you while they can. They're talking directly from God wouldn't know. Were all peasants in this weird exchange. Yeah. No, not conduit. So are they, you know, and I think, I think good get delusions have gotten.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       I think a lot of people do. You know, and I've met, I've met you and I'm a fan of yours and they really enjoyed it. I think I, like I said before, you never had Wim Hoff who I love Russell Brown, brilliant. You know, in Dr Rhonda, Patrick and Joe and Ian and you know that that component and all the fights companion and I love that. Me, I like it the way that normal and I don't think he, I don't think it gives us the right to try and walk them. Walk. Uh, yeah. Um, well, no, not, I've been spot if he ties because of your shell. Even in Thailand and not black, I still wouldn't be any different. Well, you especially because you're so aware of these traps that the mindsets, it is a weird dance that we do in this life where you're trying to sort of manage the mind and figure out what it is that's holding you back or helping you or you know, just sort of guide yourself through this existence. Nine Times out of 10 your unconscious mind is trying to help you, but people decipher it wrongly. I think it stays. It's the language that you mind speaks. I'll get into it. Understand that to move away from chaos. Like I said, we're going to do a technique if that's all right. Yeah. You just

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       want everybody not to be driving when doing this. All operating. Any machinery here. We're going to do a technique, folks strapping, but he relax, you know, and I want to share that, um, because you know, chaos is not easy, life is easy, life isn't easy. You got all sorts of cesium bursts in burst. Exactly. You know, you can be me going along and all of a sudden you get sideswiped by something, you know what I mean, and can, you know, not if for sex or, you know, etc. So it's about trying to calm the chaos down and, and, you know, and just get your mind to settle and give yourself even a few moments of peace. Even a few momentS of patient the day would be, you know, it would be beneficial to everybody. I think, you know, that's what I think anyway, you know, my opinion. No, I agree. And for what it's worth,

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       I agree. I, I think we could all use some peace and reflection. So that's a big thing. Yeah. And I think like many of us are in a, in a lot of ways are a prisoner of doubt and fear. Those are, those are two big factors in a lot of people's lives and a lot of people's response to doubt and fear is to not do anything, to not take any chances to try to live safe, to try to live like very a very controlled and simple existence, but then you miss out on experiences to look back on is that you also miss out on the the. There's just living life without fear doesn't mean there's not going to be moments where you're scared and and taking chances because those moments when you do take chances are you do something new and it could be as simple as like being a 50 year old man starting jujitsu or 50 year old woman, you know, starting a martial arts class or something. Something like, I can't believe I'm doing this, but those moments where you put yourself into vulnerable positions can be very beneficial for you. So it's not a matter of avoiding everything that causes you fear. It's a matter of embracing the uncertainty of life and trying to experience it with as much positivity and as much openness and as much with the least resistance as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       Yeah. Everything was new. Once everyone's done something learned something the first time, the first time he. Does that make sense? You know, and for me so people don't understand. Is that a massive, massive amount of successes you've had in your life that you thought was impossible to tie in your life? Riding a bike for me driving that was awful. Driving mouth wash. I don't know, I was just one of those things that got into my head that I was really shy. Another car I love rubbish. I love that expression and the british, I was rubbish at it and I'm so they are to basically do it because I lived far away from my kids and now I can drive and, and it, it was something out I to really push myself to do. But I think we're all a collection of successes trying case writing the date. Right. You know all what reed, you know, telling the time, you know, these loads are thinking what we treat. So you're busy kicking the shit ourselves about what we've done wrong, you know, for me, when I watched holly holm fight last time when she fought, she looked shellshocked and I, I, that's my opinion. She looked shellshocked. Do you think she was perhaps

Speaker 3:          00:15:18       shellshocked by the last to misha tate and then jumping right back into the octagon? Or do you think that was. She was fighting a very, very difficult opponent

Speaker 2:          00:15:27       both because valentina

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       is a volunteership genco. The woman who she fought is one of the most experienced strikers in all of mma.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Period. well the sister was on a infusion season six with us in Thailand. Yeah. So she, she's from Peru, things lives in Peru, but now she, she's russian. I understand that. But she still looked shellshocked. Do you know what I mean? And, and, and I think that's, it's part of the process. I mean I think a lot of gems because it's macho because it's fight in a year you'd be all right. And pat on thE back bar. You did great today. If you have a demon like this, it's like you do know whitewash and you put all your white in and then you your. I served almost conditioning. Oh right. I have got my diet right amman point for from a weight, blah, blah, blah. My coach says mma bjj is great or whatever, or boxing or whatever the sport may be, or even if it's not sport, you know your boss or whatever, and then all of a sudden you put one red sock in your wash.

Speaker 2:          00:16:23       Everything goes pink so that little thought that can infect you. So you say, oh, you might sit there and the loneliest places I think find someone and lost it in the changing rooms. I think that's my opinion of fighters did lose in the changing rooms to have one sort of negative thought. The mind whispers something, it becomes a shower and all of a sudden you drag it with you. Well, fighter fights can be lost, but no matter how positive you are fighting anderson silva and you pee in his prime. Yeah, you're probably, fuck yeah, there is that. That's why I said he's not a guarantee. Using a mind coach isn't a guarantee you're going to win. For me, it's more help. Astronomer condition is not going to make you win, but it's a massive help you. Of course it is. I mean, I, I, I know the benefit of it. you know the benefit of it because you did a little bit of hypnosis, josie and the benefit of it in his life as well as any fight in. You know, liam harrison is a good friend of mine. Jordan watson, the other people that have worked with another people that will work in the future. It does give you a of nerves and self doubt. Is it massive hole in your boat if you're going to do something where you have to have confidence for everything in life? Yes indeed.

Speaker 3:          00:17:30       This one of the things that I like about fighting is that it's so condensed. It's, it's a very extreme situation. It's, it's sort of like problem solving, condensed to like one of the most intense versions of it that we possibly can experience other than war, war, probably being the most intense of problem solving, but it's, you're presenting with all these incredibly difficult challenges and you have to figure your way through it and with a poor mindset or a faulty mind that you're, you're, you're, it's like having a flat tire or having bad breaks. It's like you're traveling in a very precarious way. It's you, you have a lot of holes in whatever method of distribution that your thoughts and your actions are, are passing through your system, your system of life, like who you are, the way you think about things. When you think about yourself, where you would think about other people like that shapes all the results, all the interactions that you have with people are shaped. It's one of the things that I've always said about like a lot of these interactIons that police officers have with, uh, with people like how many of these interactions would be completely different with a more calm police officer, a better person who's better at handling people and how many of them are shaped by someone who's just not that smart or too authoritarian or doesn't know how to read people well or doesn't know how to broach a conversation well.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       Again, it goes back dealing with something in their own mind. yes. Dating me, something in narrow mind, like we talked about limitless, didn't we? The movie bradley cooper first takes the pill and he saw, he said the chinese lady on the top of the stairs, I think she's his lung lady ladies show you or something. She's going bananas, right? Just going bananas are him, you know, talking rubbish and I'm. Tcc has given him lots of grief and blah, blah blah. But it went beyond. It all is something that was upsetting her. Right? That's, that's what you come across a lot in timeline already in anything. Rarely is there. They're actually taught, they're Not really taught, people are not theIr behaviors as cliched nlp, nlp chat, but if people are not happy in neuro linguistic programming, what is that about? A maker engineer. Robin's right. YeAh.

Speaker 2:          00:19:46       Anthony robbins and john grinder. Richard bandler were the first people to do it. They modeled a hypnotherapist called milton erickson, milton erickson language. Milton erickson was very, very good hypnotherapists and very, very clever on indeed. So yeah, and the, some of that I used some of that, you know, but um, you get, you get, as you get anything, you don't understand this, you know, you, you do your podcast energy as you get more and more into it, you get a feel of fur and that's what you do with my job, wIth the mind coaches they get afraid of. But I don't always use hypnosis. I do use it and it was his, but not always because it's not always necessary. It's getting people thinking, reframIng something. So maybe thought of it like that and move that out the way. And that's, that changes people's opinions and, and come out massive effects on them.

Speaker 3:          00:20:32       So the more people you interact with, the more people you apply these techniques to, the better your understanding of how these techniques work.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       Yeah, I rolled a better understanding of people. I think you've got to be out at sorts of people as well doing this gel, but I think you've got to be at a church now. Not saying I'm massively,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       no loads of stuff, but I don't know little bits about things, you know, and I don't pretend to know about a lot of things, but he's just about just being able to communicate with people and actually get them, you know, actually getting them. People pretty much want the same thing. You know what I mean? Everyone wants to live life as, as, as exciting or as easy as possible. You know, you know, like I said before, it's just about language. It's just about deciphering the language, what they're actually talking and not even really as easy as possible because a lot of people want a life full of adventure, but what they don't want to do is trip over themselves. Like if you have a difficulty and Saved, you're going to climb a mountain. Right? I think that climbing a mountain is difficult enough. Yeah, it's hard.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       You have to figure out what way to grip. You have to have strong hands and strong feet. You have to have an overall awareness of your body and balance and you have to be physically fit enough to build a pool yourself and climb up this mountain. If you're paralyzed with fear, if you are consumed with self doubt, if you were overrun with guilt, if your body is just dealing with the minds, all the haunts of your past, that's the compounds. Whatever difficultY and it makes it way worse. That's what, you know, people come to me after fights and the, you know, they talk about the last fight is still involved in it. You know, they don't tAke the positive from it and I'd say take the ponds and new blah blah blah. But I mean, you hard to say, well, it's hard to do rather than to out today.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       Let's go to the moon. Right. Basically. You know what I mean? So you just. For me, he's like just just getting the person just to sometimes forget something, you know what I mean? And just move on and write. Okay, that's something. What did you learn this, this and this. Well, that's the point. That's what we know when we was doing timeline therapy, you know, there was things you learn from that situation that got you here. Got you. The ufc come and say successful, stand up on a lot. He's got your way. You've got because of them things that molded you. You know, some people do get consumed by fear, which is why I. That's why I like to change, you know, I like to change the. Yeah, there's the, there's a big problem that a lot of people have where they define themselves by their past.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       They look at their past, they don't think they could ever grow from that. They think that is who I am. I'm not losers. I'm the guy who crashed his car on that guy that, you know, whatever it was that moment that never did it. So therefore, you know, like money is the root of all evil. All you have money or they saw your keynote, you have to tread on people to be a success as cliched saying. Just pop up from nowhere. You know? That's a real weird one that comes up a lot that almost like it's impossible to be successful

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       in altruistic that year. That money is acquired only by stepping on other people and fucking over people and anybody that's really big in business get like. I read that once from someone who actually a very smart person and said, show me someone who's really good in business and I guarantee you they fuck someone over, and I like that as everyday that's, that's as a scapegoat. The scapegoat for your own financial failure.

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       Closest thing. The more money you get, the more money. The more people you can help.

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       There's that for sure. There's more opportunity.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       Yeah, that's what I believe and I'm believing and I think it's cliched. The other thing about money is to just to keep people down. I think that's that existed. You know what I mean? His language to keep people down, to keep people just there, to keep them in the place.

Speaker 3:          00:24:31       Well, it's also self self prescribe to a lot of people do it to themselves. No one's doing it to you. You just want to. You want to give yourself a little excuse for not going after whatever your goals are or not pursuing whatever interest you actually have and just playing it safe. That playing it safe. I think a big part of that is what we were talking about earlier, is this, this need to avoid any further pain. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       You know, one thing wanting to Japan is like you're not allowed to like yourself. I mean, you know, you're not allowed to be not fun. I mean it's all right. You gotta have fun and laugh at yourself and not take yourself massively tissues. Well, the things that you want to be serious, you should be supporting yourself less than 100 percent. Support is sabotage, which has a say in which I believe it's true. You know, if you're not supporting yourself, aesop mythology, not only you but you sabotage and everybody else around you. And I think people struggle with that be in being all right to themselves. You know, the so easy to shit and stupid and fat and so easily swallowed that you, you know, people be become used to it and then they want to be a success. It doesn't make sense. Now I recently the, you know, these people that want to fight and then he got lost me fight and blah blah blah. And then you find out what they did onto the runup or what did you do? Oh, I got drunk, let's say a week before. Hello fucking surprise if you're not live in it and if you're not, you know, getting, you know, really immersing yourself in every way in the language that you speak to yourself and in the way that you do everything else. What do you expect your mind not going to support you if you don't support it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       That was one of the things that I felt when jon jones tested positive for cocaine three weeks out of his fight with daniel cormier, I was like, ooh. Like he's not even as I look, I only was anything wrong with doing. I don't know if there's anything wrong with doing cocaine. I just, I don't think it's a positive drug put. Some people enjoy it. some people enjoy drinking. I enjoy drinking. I don't think that's a positive drug necessarily either, so I don't know because I don't have experience with cocaine, but that's not something you're supposed to be doing three weeks outside of a world title fight with one of the best wrestlers in the sport. One of the most difficult challenges you've ever faced in your professional career and you're out doing blow just 21 days before. That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Yeah. Sometimes the most talented take the gifts that they've been given and just abused them in a way. I met. I met jon jones. He's, um, it's different to say the least. In what way? She's just a bit. It was a dot. I didn't know it was, it was kind of only met him briefly. Why was it. I might been Russia at the legend that is a show there. And uh, yeah, he was just, he was very sort of, it was all over the place bouncing around and I just, I just didn't expect him to be like that. What do you mean by all over the place? Bouncing just a. He just said to me, hi blue eyes. I would like hello. He's massive from dangerous and I'm not. I was like, hi. I just found it a bit strange. Maybe I read it with you.

Speaker 2:          00:27:39       I just found him different. Let's just say that I just found him different and I, I'm trying to read into this and I'm trying to avoid it badly. I don't know him, but I met. It was, it was different. Let's put it that way, you know, but um, if, if they, if someone, I don't know, you don't know what's gone on in his life and uh, you know, you don't know what's going on in his life and you could say that about. Everyone could say that about a serial killer couldn't. Yeah. What are we doing? What's going on in his life? It's not useful, you know, really. I mean there is some things that you shouldn't do and you know, he shouldn't be doing it, but these reason,

Speaker 3:          00:28:15       if you listen to john's coaches, they will tell you that john surrounds himself with the wrong people. And john is an extremely talented guy, amazing. It's only like maybe one of the most talented guys to ever compete in the sport and incredibly strong mentally too, because despite all of his issues with maybe not preparing as well as you could when the chips are down, that guy gets through things. He overcomes. Adversity is not a front runner. He's the one that broke his toe, isn't a. That was terrific. So he's coming and he didn't even realize that was happening, that that happened actually in the final flurry where you stopped shale son and a more impressive performances when he fought vito belfort, vito, or completely hyperextended his arm and he would not tap you. It was for his title vii tour. Came that close. Was it for the title? I believe it was. It might've been non title fight, but vetoer came find out that was a title fight or non title fight. Either way, vidor came that close to legitimately beating John Jones. That close god fully locked in armbar. That would have made 90 percent of the professional fighters in the world tap.

Speaker 2:          00:29:23       Well, that's what makes him who he is. But he put it, but you couldn't say no to. It was a title fight. Yeah. Jamie just looked at it. He couldn't say no to some below. Well he could say no. You want. Didn't want us to get some sort of. I don't know if it's weakness. I don't know. There's some sort of weakness but isn't

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       say that. Don't know if it is a. It's not. It shouldn't be something you should be doing. It's also indulgence. It's like he likes to party, you know? But then there's. Isn't there also the issue that fighters in particular, especially guys that have a lot of hard gym sessions and a lot of hard fights, they have impulse control problems and those impulse control problems. I'm obviously not a scientist or a doctor, but when you talk to neurologists and neuroscientists, they will tell you that there are direct correlations between head impacts and poor impulse control is absolutely a direct impact and I'm not looking for a scapegoat in my own life, but I've looked back at some of the poor decision making that I've done in my life, particularly in my fighting times like back then and I was like, I wonder if a lot of that was getting hit in the head a lot.

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       Like, like it can't be good to get kicked in the head. It's just never good. Not the best is not good and so if you've been kicked in the head or punched in the face or whatever, any kind of impact. And that's the thing about football players. They're saying now, is it even a shot to the chest even getting tackled like someone rams at you and slams their shoulders into your chest. The brain gets jostled around. You might not have a bruise on your face, but your brain is receiving essentially the same impact as a punch. Just kinda crazy. You know, a lot of people might not like they split. It is a shame that jon jones is gone. Do you know what I mean? Because he's got to look back on him. Yeah. You know what I mean? He's got to look back on him and they fuck, you know, he's also got to figure out what it is that he took no data.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       They don't even. Exactly. They have an isolated what he took, but the whole lifestyle, it's most certainly an issue and it's almost like one of those things where you say you don't know what you got until it's gone. Well, it was kind of gone for a little while, but not really. He was always still in the mix and there was always multimillion dollar fights, a waiting and then he fought over in st prue. So he's back in the mix and everything's looking good. He's slated to fight at ufc 200 against daniel cormier is going to make 10 million bucks. It's going to be giant and then whoosh. It's gone for something that if you talk to people that are experts in performance enhancing drugs, they'll tell you that this clomiphene is what he got popped for, which is an anti estrogen supplement that's not even beneficial.

Speaker 3:          00:32:17       The only time that stuff's beneficial is a set of essentially when you're coming off of steroids, but yet he didn't test positive for steroids before or after. So it could have been a tainted supplement. It could have been a mistake. It could have been. Who knows what wacky shit he was taken. I mean, I don't know. I just think that, you know, people forget that they lot. Sometimes you still to have guidance, you know, you still go have a guide and you know, to just say, look, is that the best thing you should be doing? Also wants to talk. So you know what I mean? It's that that's not going to be high five and you cause you're going to stick a load of bugle you nose. Isn't it harder though? I think for champions, because once they like dominate someone to kick someone's ass, like say if you find the most difficult fight of your career, you fight, you know, uh, whether there's daniel cormier, whoever it is, you dominate them, you win and beautiful fashion and then you know, you like, god damn it, I am the fucking man, and then you just want to do whatever you want to do after that and indulgence and chaos and yeah, he did it, but it comes to bite you on the ass all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       It does, but god dammit, it is a fucking story that plays itself out over and over and over and over and over. And there's a bunch of these distractions stories like the ronda rousey story is ultimately a story of distraction. I mean, here's this woman who is just a freak, right? A completely dominant female ass kicker. Something that we've never had before. I mean, we had like female fighters before, like you remember christy martin was sort of a. So yeah, like there was like a little bit of it with laila ali. People were kind of paying attention to her, but no one was paying attention to anyone even remotely on the scale of ronda rousey. But what happens then? Well, all of a sudden hollywood opens up doors. You start doing movies, you get all these offers, you the darling of talk shows. You're in fucking commercials all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:34:14       Everybody wants to kiss your ass and there's people that are coming up all around you that are assassins and they're not getting all this attention. They're just hungry. They're not like holly holm. When she fought, ronda was a massive underdog. Meantime, meanwhile, she was a 19 time world boxing champion. She was a far more accomplished striker than ronda and ronda fought the exact wrong fight when you're fighting a 19 time world boxing champion. Whereas misha tate fought the exact right fight, standing outside, barely, barely engage her with strikes. Just push her, push her, but backdrop, pusher and backup pusher. Constantly move, constantly vary your approach and then when you get ahold of her account and she did that in the second round and then ultimately she did it in the fifth round and submitted her and that's what one or the fight, the difference between someone who has everything to gain like that. Someone who is hungry and then the fucking mindset of someone who becomes super successful. Like a Mike Tyson in his prime. Yeah. Yeah. Like just. You've just started fucking off. You start believing that no one's going to beat your ass and then you fight buster douglas with very little training and he fucking puts that leather. Your face and reality hits you. When that referee standing over you counting, you realize, oh, this is happening to me now. it must be difficult. Any muslim

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       bez, but fighting is not easy to say. No. It's definitely not. I mean, I was talking to somebody yesterday. We went out to a thai restaurant with some friends from back. Brian [inaudible] moves me, bail my may have come to see our and we'll just talk and him was talking about fighting a fight so hard and only nervous or scared or whatever. You was screaming ouT you, you were there corner screaming shirt. You think in what they telling him you're in the crowd if you're not, if you're not zoned in properly. And it's not easy. I mean, you know, invite as you know, all of a sudden the defined something, they might not have been the hardest kid at school, you might not have been, you know, the most popular. All of a sudden after a few fights he just seemed like whack. He's like John Jones or, or rhonda and all of a sudden you're in this loads of money and people are paying you attention that, you know, wouldn't assaults. See what school and stuff like that. It's a muslim. Be easy, but nevertheless you still got some. You've still got. I think that, you know, you've got to maintain the rules. You've got to abide the rules. You have to have someone who helps you.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       I think every fighter, I mean I shouldn't say every fighter because some kind of figured out on their own. There's some guys that don't seem to fall into those traps, but most fighters can use some sort of guidelines and there's also these facilitators that manifest themselves in your life. These people that want to make your life easier so they could be a part of your life. So they want to bring over girls. They want to bring over booze. They want to get you into the club. They want to. They want to like, hey, this is a, that guy that he's going to set everything up for you. I'll take care of it. And when they're doing is these guys are. They get into your life and the way they get into your life as by making things easier for you so they can be a part of the, you know, Mike Tyson camp or whatever it is.

Speaker 3:          00:37:22       And then next thing you know, you've got this entourage of 20 people hanging around you and most of them are just fucking idiots and don't know who they are. And you're paying for their existence. You are funding their existence and what they do is they hold doors open for you and they check you into hotel rooms. They do all these things that you could do on your own. They sort of make it easier and in making it easier, they sort of defined what is okay and then like, you know, no big deal. Just going to go party. You gonna fuck this guy up. Anyway man, let's go hit the club. And then next thing you know you're out late at night, not getting rest. Your coach is texting you, are you in bed and you're not because you're hanging around with these fucking cling on

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       and then when you've lost, they vanish, they vanish and then you've lost. You vanish. And then you've got to pick up the pieces. That's as one interesting more I'd like to do is I'd like to people for me to be able to hire me, obviously to be able to talk soon, you know, not just use it now. She was like, this is on my mind. Well this, this and this. Not to potter a block on before they do something that's fucking stupid. Do you know what I mean? I'd like to do that and I think you'll do that anyway. Do you know what I mean? But I just. It's difficult. It's difficult

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       to make it stick. Yeah. Like if you have a good idea in your head about like, you know what I need to do with my life? I need to eat healthy, I need to exercise. You need to follow my dreams. Okay, good. Right now that's a. That's a good thought right now, but how do you keep that? How do you make it stick? and that's a big issue with people that go up and they go down. I mean how ridiculous our new year's resolutions. How many people have come to you after new years in there that are going to lose 50 pounds? I'm going to stop smoking, I'm not going to eat any unhealthy. And then you see them like a couple of weeks later, they look great. Well you're sticking to it. That's awesome man. Congratulations by the money, isn't it? And then five months later they're fat again. And looking stupid and it's so normal,

Speaker 2:          00:39:16       so funny, isn't it? Have clubs go right? You joined in january, you get free january and then you blah blah blah. And they go god often when really join in fee and then the jain, that's it. New year, new me january this 30 new year new me. And then they just like january the third. Oh well blah blah blah. can't be asked. Or I was listening to this type of least resistance.

Speaker 3:          00:39:39       I was listening to a ted talk. It was a ted podcast. And in this, uh, it was also a ted talk with. They're talking about time in the way people perceive time and the way people perceive time. They always perceive that they are now a finished product. This is like a big thing that people like to do. They're like, they look at themselves like, wow, you know, when I was 20 I didn't know shit, but now that I'm 30 I got it together. And then when they're, do they go, well, when I was 30 I thought I knew something, but now I know things and they always want to thank that. They're done growing, but what this podcast is sort of emphasizing is that people are in a constant state of change and evolution. If you're thinking about things, you know the expression, no one's perfect. This true. No one is perfect, so if in fact you're not perfect, that means you're considering whatever you've done that maybe you could have done better or maybe we could have handled better or maybe could have thought about in a better way or a more beneficial way. And then you grow and learn from that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:37       Yeah, and it comes to the state of flux. You know, I'm, I'm a different person as it was. I was there nearly spot on a year and I've learned more and changed and different opinions. Nothing if you read anything or you know, because with youtube and got the likes of you, you know rhonda, patrick and about tumeric, the I learned from, from listening to you and listening to people and off facebook and I got tumeric user group because they tend to cut off rights and before went to the doctors can't do anything. Just off the pipe. Take piracy at one. Your arthritis from kickboxing. Yes. Belly dancing. Elaborate, lying. Don't be sad about dancing, but I'm some whatever. Anyway, that's a real common one, right? With the ankles and stuff. Yeah. And um, I, I just, the doctor said, you know, that's it. Basically you take policy elmo.

Speaker 2:          00:41:30       So put on facebook paracetamal paracetamal. Liza painkiller small. So I just felt, you know, and you know, you can't keep taking ibuprofen or might be saying to jo about ibuprofen and it causes inflammation. Anyway, so I, I'll put it on facebook said, does anyone got an experienced arthritis? One of my friends, lee fraser, can't praise them enough to be honest. Functionally, he said he takes tumeric. So start every search and it, you'd mentioned it to joe. We're curcumin. Curcumin is the ingredient. So I looked on a human user group and then they said they think about golden paste, which is tumor at black pepper and coconut oil. You cook it for seven minutes with water, make a paste of it. And I mean look on facebook, use a grave and you, you, you basically take that. I've been taking it regularly and there's no pain, no pain whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       So it's brilliant. It's the same information as you grind up the tumeric? No. You're making it in a, in a supplement form or you're getting it from a route you get cheaper. Get tumeric? No. yeah, the powder. okay. So you're not getting, you know, you could buy the root. The root is real common now. It's really interesting little pool miracle. No, no, not really shitty supermarket over there. I'm not going to slack off or anything as a supermarket is another one. Lakh it off talking rubbish. So no, the powder works and you know, you Just don't know the actual measurements of it. But say it's a cup of water, half a cup of tumeric. You cook it for seven minutes on a low heat. So it starts getting into a paste. You add black pepper, like maybe two teaspoons of it because it's an active ingredient that makes it, makes it 400 times more absorbable and nobody really.

Speaker 2:          00:43:16       Yeah. Wow. Black pepper. Pepper green. Huh? Man. Why does it have to be cooked? I don't know. I'm not good with send to do. I could try. Yeah. Well, how does it taste when you eat it? No, the best thing is just like, what would you either have pain or. Oh, that was horrible. I'm the king of drinking disgusting things. I drink a lot of shitty things. Um, but he does work. Tried my kale shake recipe and almost vomited. I've a friend who, I have a friend called, um, Nathan Wright and his hands. He said he couldn't, his hands were that bad with arthritis that you couldn't spray deodorants and he stunk it and that's his words, not mine. And then he started taking this tumor it paste and he's fine. He says he's coming like an 80 slash 90 percent better. I mean, come on. do you use fish oil and if you altered your diet, may. Yes, yes, I do take a lot of fish oil. How much do you take? Um, I take two massive tablespoons of it when I'm at home because I've been in the state. So I thought I was taking five capsules. We war and was taking ubiquinol, coenzyme q 10, but it is a little bit of higher level one and um, yeah, and, and me makes me, my, my friends now

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       orin has just got this a tumeric and arnica tight oil type stuff. Gone. Three leopards, lemonade, liniments that I've, you know, see you're going to trial and that had a massage it yesterday. Clear up your words or tyler intimate is what you're saying. Yes. Smells the same as tile. If we explain to people with ms dot lindemann tie fighters would use for sore muscles and things along those lines like wintergreen menthol and, and stuff like that. I don't know what tiger balm was a big one that, a bit like that, but it's, it's what does that stuff do? It's very good. Um, arnica gets bruises I want to share with you. Don't like it gets rid of bruises. Um, so how does it really work at? Well, I've only just started using it, but as far as I'm concerned, I liked it. I have a friend who's a doctor and he told me that all that stuff like bengay and I go, oh, that's stuff that makes me feel better.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       He goeS, he goes, it's a topical analgesic and go, what does that mean? He goes, it makes your skin red. Oh, it makes you feel like a was happening. You like heat there and feels good, but It goes in order for that stuff to absorb deeply into your system, into your, into your, get into your tissue. He's like, you would have to get into your bloodstream and then it would be toxic. Yeah, and I was like, oh yeah, good. When you take like one of those, some tiger balm. I have these patches that I'll put on, like if I have a muscle pull or something like that, I'll put a tiger balm patch on it and it somehow or another relaxes it in some sort of a way, but it might be psychological. Psychological are nice. I like, it. Smells nice. Normal smell, arnica title.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       Intimate stuff your friend uses to america's world as well. Yeah, there's loads his spiel on it, you know, and on the ball, but I just want of these people, you know, when I had a massage of it yesterday, now I feel relaxed. Will they say that most of the issues that people have, whether even lIke a lot of diseases, the stem from inflammation and a lot of inflammation is caused by diet. It's caused by, you know, just eating bad food and not being healthy into your body has this reaction to this food and it's inflammatory reaction. Yeah. He said he's certainly not easy. What fleet you find out, what gives you inflammation and what doesn't? I don't know. I think most vary from person to person and most things and you know, an allergy thing, the golden pace, the tumeric thinkers were brilliant for me.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       I can't, I can't praise that enough. that's interesting. And so how quickly did it take, like how long did it take before it was like you were really rock solid with it. We realized that this was really beneficial for about two days. Two days. Honestly. That's incredible. And I was, I was really working for the american industry. I was young and you can buy this now. I was really pissed off because the docs are went, oh, there's nothing you can do. And sometimes you say to the doctor, I think I've got this, that and the other one because they think that you're self diagnose anything. No, you know, you know, this sort of like a, you know, and just start. And I just said, look, you know, and she said, well, it's arthritis, you know, you just paracetamal and I think one one. And then when I put on facebook, which is a good tool for sometimes for getting information like the internet is, and he worked a treat and then he got into this group and yeah, it was brilliant and it's worked for me fantastically well.

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       Yeah, you have to sort of separate the bullshit from the reality. But if you can do that, you can definitely find a lot of stuff online. And it's confusing to me when doctors dismiss dietary solutions because very few doctors are really well educated in nutrition, especially educated in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in absorbing nutrients and what compounds or accentuates nutrition absorption and what's beneficial. There's so, so many doctors are just, they, they, they poo poo it because they don't understand that they have no knowledge of it. Well my friend, when he, when when he taught tumor tumeric, it went to the doctor's and the doctor was saying, you know, you can take these whatever I think it is. And he said, saved my destiny, destiny. Any always have stopped having the. because he had a regular checkup. We had gout really badly. And he went in and then.

Speaker 1:          00:49:03       And then the doctor said, he said, I've been taking tumeric. And he said to me, he said, there's the doctor said, well our third of that, but it's not been tested tumeric. And said that. He said, well, I've heard it works, but it's not been tested. So they're aware I think. I think there are. I don't want to piss on docsis double blind, placebo controlled studies from any major university that shows the beneficial effects of turmeric or is it just probably make any money? Does it tumeric? What should you know? I mean, it seems like it should, right? I mean, isn't there a massive industry and helping people with inflamed, inflamed tendons? The problem with those things is you can't control it. Like if you do a Study on, you know, whatever, fill in the blank of tylenol or something like that. Someone created tylenol, right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       So if you do a study on tylenol and you so it shows its efficacy, then you could sell more of it. But if you do a study on turmeric, I'm like, great, glad. Thanks for funding this study. I'm going to go sell it now and I'm going to point to your study and I'm going to make a ton of money off of your study and I can just grow it in my backyard. I mean that's, that's the problem with marijuana. The plan is a problem with any sort of spin. It's a survey. It's like 100 people surveyed. I've never been asked about, we're not talking about surveys, we're talking about double blind placebo controlled studies on information. If they did something along those lines, like one of the big issues that's going on with medical marijuana is the pushback from pharmaceutical companies that are trying to stop medical

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       marijuana from becoming legal nationwide and they they've halted at least delayed this supreme court's changing of the designation from a schedule one to schedule two in this country. Schedule one shows no medicinal value whatsoever. That's where marijuana is. Meanwhile, marijuana is passed as a medical supplement in, I don't know how many states now. I think it's like 20 and it's legal in four or five states now. It's legal in Washington dc. It's legal in Colorado. It's legal in Washington state. It's legal in Oregon just recreationally, so it's obviously there is some benefit of it medically if all these doctors are prescribing and it shows massive reduction in tumors with the use of cbd, it helps control pain simpson oil. Yes. Yeah. I mean, it's incredible how much benefit there is in this one plant, but yet the pushback from the pharmaceutical industry is still incredibly strong because they don't.

Speaker 3:          00:51:25       I posted something really recently how much money. The pharmaceutical. There was a chart that showed how much money the pharmaceutical industry stands to lose. If medical cannabis is made legal nationwide and readily available, it's billions of dollars every year they're going to lose because all these solutions that they offer, there's better, simpler, simpler and far cheaper solutions with cannabis, especially because it's one of the easiest things to grow. I mean a lot of people grow their own tomatoes in their backyard and things like that. Like pot. All you do is plant it, throw some water on it. It's done.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Not in england. In england, they won't grow unless you got. Well, I don't know why. It's not the best weather of way. You know what I mean? I guarantee you we'd will grow in england to try and some some lights and let's try it and film it live and let live. How illegal illegal is. Pot and in england you can get. You can get arrested. He can. I don't know. I'm not very good with it being dangerous. Meanwhile, nobody's drunk and I've never seen more drunk. People say, god damn you. People love to drink. It's hilarious, but you're good at it. That's what I'm looking for. Way better at being drunk. Yeah. I think I'm rubbish at drinking. I'm. Oh god, yeah. Oh yeah. When I start crying, cry, sing, dance hall. Just memory loss, you know, the usual, the usual stuff that. But you know, I don't know with cannabis in it, I don't take it, but I mean to see what's going on. I think belief, I believe that there's a cure for everything on the planet. I think we've, we these loads of stuff that we haven't explored that the mind as well. Just stuff to explore yet the mind is a fascinating solution to a lot of issues that people have and sinking positive or thinking negative or worry

Speaker 3:          00:53:25       and the stress. And we were talking earlier about cortisol and the stress response to literally thinking about something affects your physical health and thinking about things in the wrong way. Affects your physical health. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       and when we got we got, I think we got more things to worry about. I think we've got more things to worry about now, but they're actually not anything to worry about. Does that make sense? When you look at facebook and you get model, the someone's fucking idiot, trump supporter healthier, you don't know anything about that and you start typing something while I'm doing that. When you get involved in something or you get angry about something, I do it, you know, I'm not going to lie and they, you think to yourself fucking medu in years ago when you and the caveman was only worried about if they're going to get somethings going to eat them all, they've got something and I think that might have been easier. Of course he died of diseases and he died, may have died younger to whatever, but I mean they lived the mall and easeful life now facebook though. So didn't even, didn't have anything to look and they didn't have comments on youtube. Like John Wayne Powell was saying he was gay. He gets mad. Yeah. But I mean I just, I call it the same. I got almost, I was cold virus all for game of thrones, which I was quite pleased about it. I was like, oh, I'll take lord various little penis. Nothing wrong with that. No, I know, but I just think, you know, I don't get it. Things don't guys don't get haters. I don't understand them,

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       but don't you though, because when we were talking about all these different things that happen in life that sort of set you up for the next stages of life and define you and sort of alter and affect your decision making process and your behavior process, don't you think that a lot of these people just live very unfortunate existences and whether it's by chance or whether it's by bad decision making that has just compounded itself over the years. When you see some of the hateful things that people posted about, let's say john wayne parr, who's the nicest guy, brilliant guy and multiple time world champion. Incredibly complex, nice. His kids a great, fantastic as kids. So cool. By the way, there's a video of his kid hitting the pads. you want to see something impressive. His kid is fighting. I think she's fighting on the 20th, 20th, jasmine and jazzy and he sent me this video of her hitting the pads. You know, like a whole, you know, the son can do flips. Oh yeah. Your family. They're pretty incredible. His wife was a fighter.

Speaker 2:          00:55:57       Well that's. I went and stayed with them. They went to that show and not listen nothing but respect for john wayne pies. A lovely guy. And he's got a great sense of humor as well, you know, don't take themselves too seriously.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       I know he's very self deprecating. he's very aware of how good he is, but he's also very self deprecating. Like, watch this. Let's watch this video. This is her.

Speaker 4:          00:56:19       Nope. What happened? What'd you

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       change the screens? Your computer fail

Speaker 5:          00:56:34       Thailand. And this girl's like, what is she 10, something like that. Jimmy in Australia.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       Oh, there's another one. There's one that I looked at. There was different. It was on youtube. Oh, she's 13 years old. Okay. But my point is, you know, there's people that hate on this guy and they, they're not. Well no, like they're not happy. They're not looking at him going, you fucking loser. They don't like finding a reason why he's there. Just trying to find a reason. I got it. I got one about math. A pest say nobody knows nothing slip. When did you get this? Just one of the comments, you know, and I was just like. And he was like, yeah, you know nothing about hypnosis, right? Well, I'm here and your salary, he doesn't mean to mean you know nothing. You know nothing about derren brown a lot. I've only been to see him three times. I had all thEse books and he's amazing, amazing guy and I know that, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       But he just, just thinking you'll get whatever you get, whatever you do. I deem this like, I think joe joe chilean said jesus was great. It invite him to a party. You could turn this water into wine. He could. Hey, you grabbed that dad, don't worry, we'll bring you butts alive. You broke your leg a. Yeah, go. You know, we'll go fishing and catch all the fish. It was a great guy. He's still killed him. YOu know you're going to get, people are going to hate you just because it's more about latin than isabel. Here it is more about the news about you. That is a. That's a big factor with online interaction with people where you are. What you're doing is you're interacting with their own paths and their own failures and the vast majority of people in this life are not living fulfilled and happy existence of faceless assassins huntley.

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       The faceless assassins really like snipers of nothingness. Oh, you mean commenters? Yeah, but they're not really faceless. Right? Like at the end of the day, if you get to who they really are and what's really bothering them, they're no different than you or I. They just. They got a fucked up start in this life and they never recovered. That's what most of it is extending into me. No, I've always been like this. There's a whole video. I did a on youtube and be the hero of your own movie scene. It's very good. If you were in a movie and the movie started right now and you're a fucking failure, just think about where your life's at. What would the hero do? What would you do? Address one? No, my friend warren brown. What should they yourself, but he's on a tv show called. Did they make him double seven? A lot of white people freaking out catalogs. he has bought martini. Shaken, not stirred. Don't care what color he is, but he was a. Wore a knee, worked for them, and he's doing a show now for discovery and he's training to be a kickboxer. He's gonna have a fight. It just says he's gonna fight. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       Who's he fighting? I don't know. Yeah. How old is he? He's, I think he's 42. He's gonna. Have his first ever kickbox and my friend karen kettle, he's training each training and they've been all over it. It's a show with discovery. Was meant to be on it and be the mind coach for the show that. is there any video of him training? Not yet. Not yet. Can find some. Jim warren warren who was on the show with him. Oh right. Not yet. Sorry.

Speaker 6:          00:59:52       Oh, jesus. Daniel. Sam as well from england. Not bad stuff. It's hard to say, oh, it's terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:00:05       Someone's going to tell him to keep his fucking hands up.

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       Look at his kicks though. Not too bad. Not too bad. If you stand right in front of him, will fuck you up your game. Now he's getting. He's got to be. If he's actually going to have a fight and he's gay. God, he's so off balance though, right when I say that he falls. It's like you're watching it's fundamentals. It's almost like he really shouldn't be hitting pads here. If I was coaching the garlic that I would tell him, all I want you to do is touch these things over five years old, five years old, so he's gotten better. Well, hey man, that's really good. Then if that's five years ago and he's been steady at it since then, that's really good because he's got some basic movements down the waste, throwing his weight into things. He just, you know, tried. You guys tried to hit things hard before they learn how to hit,

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       right? Correct. Yeah, because his friend who was in it in luther, that the other detective was warren brown. He's my mate, my friend. He wants two world titles in thai boxing, so I think they'd been talking about in warren's been helping him and karen. Karen's been helping him, but it should be a good show because you see all of them seem train in and between movies like is made when we spielberg the dark tower or something with where's he going to fight? I don't know. Maybe in Thailand, Thailand and I think going deep. I know you got to give him respect rules. The whole. I think he's fighting k one rules which dumps are easier to get elbowed in the face and of clench and all. I saw business, but you've got to give. Given respect to like that. I don't like the way he's testing himself, but he did a video on youtube about life and that now he envisioned himself doing this something new. I really like that. I was going to take what I weren't part of the show. I really wanted to do that. I. I was gutted, gutted word you just said.

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       What did you say? It's part and parcel. That's what I kept saying last time I was a upset guilted. You were upset because I went, what was it was going to be part of the show is a mind coach, you know, because fighters have coaches now. But anyway, logistically didn't and stuff like that,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       but I mean I wish him all the best and karen and everyone on the show, it would be brilliant. So who's coachIng him? Kiran kettle. Oh, from csa know karen. Korean. Okay. Karen. Karen cattle east from england. Kurian from csa is a irish gentleman, right? What is his last syrian he's carrying? Carrying. I don't know. I forget his last name was. He thinks gibbons? Yeah. Fitsgibbons. Yeah. He's a good coach. He coaches. Aila doesn't eat. And um, Kevin Ross has a good culture in gust on bellarmine. Yeah. Very good. Have you seen the fight between mohammed, uriah in northern venmo? No. Can you flush your right now if we just spell it out? A curator isj a r a y aj a r a y a v ben meaux, b a n m o h he's only just watched the third round at his face.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       He didn't get a word that I could tell. I spelled it out slowly. J a r a y a versus bevmo b e n m o hate. I'm writing it with my finger. Oh, what'd you say? Yeah, the moroccan. Did you say h or h? Why say hey? change. Because it's how you go see each. Yeah. Hates, hates you guys do that too with z. Say zed. Yeah, we do. What the fuck is that? We do. I don't know why. How did it get abandoned? Sydney to industry to keep up like this seems to be some disconnect between some of the words like tires you guys use or why? And color with no view. And we uncover what the fuck is that about? do you have extra hughes lane or just. Yeah, we just felt fro. They said why? Why is tired t y r e golf august. Who invented tires? I think we did. So you might want to fuck off. Go now.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       So, uh, what do you want me to see about this? One of the best kickboxing fights I've ever seen in my life. Really? Absolutely ridiculous. It was a last year on infusion. Much common sense on. I work for these, but these two knock the proverbial holes out of each other. May 27th of March. March 27th, 27th. Okay. What does mch is that saying? Oh, it's the. Okay, I see what you're saying. So in round, just put round three on. He got an end with fusion is with an e folks. E n s u s I o n is a moitai organization. Yes. In european? Yeah. In holland. Yeah. And they do in a 200,000 euro tournament in september the 17th. But this kid to rise 19 and uh, it's, it's absolutely ridiculous fight. Wow. Okay, I'll check it out. I'll check it out. I'm a obviously a big fan of kickboxing and I'm, uh, I'm super psyched that gloria is going to put on badr hari versus rico verhoeven if bought her heart, gets out of jail in jail.

Speaker 1:          01:05:25       He's not in jail, at least not right now. But there's a long time between now and december. We'll see a cute. He makes. He makes John Jones look like a fucking choirboy true. Doesn't mean we here. We just say, oh, it's an interesting fight. I mean, for sure barter can win, for sure. Rico can win. Rico's been much more active reach. Ricoh has incredible cardio. If you go to the bar, hurry that beat alistair overeem in the rematch, you know, you go to that bot or the bot or who was in his peak mean bought her was a monster, but it's been a long time and he's not been very active over the last few years. And he said, what's up? Switch on. It's which wateR turns up. But it's also like all of the legal issues that he's gone through. All the, the, the, the behavioral issues. I mean he's had a lot of problems, allegedly broke some guy's leg and a nightclub.

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       They say it held the guy down, stomped his shin and smashed his leg. That's crazy shit man. And who knows? Who knows, who knows what the fuck is going on with that dude? I'm know his mom and dad and that real nice people. He's a nice guy and still full. You know, fathers probably the most exciting heavyweight. And he's a wild man. He's a fucking wild man and he's legit knockout power. And the other thing is he throws caution literally to the wind. I mean, he, he unloads with full power shots, wade's forward, throws, bombs, like he throws out all ideas of like being technical and being, um, being really cautious and like setting traps. He's not setting traps. He's dropping missiles on you. It gets to them and say, I've heard that if a froze up, I don't think he'd get nervous that he throws up, throws up for the fight, gets ready.

Speaker 1:          01:07:12       so none of this makes sense. If you see the way he fights fights, like it's fucking case. It doesn't, you know, if somebody killed somebody he loves, that's fights. He fights like a wilD man, but it's so exciting. But rico is a different kind of fighter. Rico is a very athletic, big heavyweight who is a amazing cardio outstanding technique. His boxing is outstanding. His kickboxing was outstanding. Huge, huge guy. He's a natural to 30 to 50 plus and he's in incredible shape. There's bought her. The thing about this is the glory of preview videos to highlight that they're putting on pretty sure. The thing about rico is that ricoh has been super active while bought, has been dealing with all these problems and rico's has been getting better and rico's been beating guys that, you know, he had some problems with some guys in the past and you see him now and he's just a much better fighter in every shape way, shape or form.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       Yeah. When he fell out, benjamIn accountability fall numbers. Really. I mean you spent. It was sparring with ties and fuel or it wasn't a good an old decent heavyweights and beat and daniel geeta who's good. Daniel geeta farts a good example because they had fought before and it was a very close fight, but in the rematch it was not close at all. Ricoh kinda ran away with it. Rico's on another level right now, but the thIng about baader is like when he was at his best and you kind of got to assume that it's possible that he could go back to how he was when he was at his best. When he went bought or was at his best. He was a fucking hurricane in there. He was. I remember that. I've seen, I've seen him because he fought a lot on it. Shell time and the moroccans absolutely love him, but a bit light geria amateur writers coming right now and les ballet, they loved them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       Who was it that he stomped in the head? Remy bone gag is when he was on the floor. Yeah, he got disqualified for that one, right? Uh, yeah, I got disqualified for both the whole thing to a bunch with a little bit like he was kinda like acting it up a little bit. I'm saying nothing. I have to go to holland. You're saying nothing smart on his part. Like listen to the fights over if I just lay here for the moment. Yeah. It just seemed a little like this guy who's been beaten up his entire career and you know, taking amazing shots. All of a sudden one kick when he's down and he just decided like, here it is right here.

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       That one kick. That was it. It can't go on. No way. Right. I mean, it wasn't a nice thing that he did. It certainly is grounds for disqualification. But to see him rolling around on the ground, like he can't, he can't function anymore. I'm like, oh, okay. It has to get swelling was worse. He did when he was on the floor. Well, he's fucking crazy. Why is he, why is he like that? Does anybody know? Don't know. I just think he's great. He said, nice if me. It was really, really nice with me and I'm like, well, he's all about. We make out of cross date. Yeah, he's just the wrong guy. Of course you don't want to fuck wIth badr. Hari is. He's a dangerous, dangerous man. So if you want to do this technique, so what is it you want to. So basically eight sites, it's a calming technique.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       Okay. Yeah, we were about to do this earlier. We got so distracted to carry on. You're going to tell people in their cars to be careful. Don't please don't do this while you're driving. What are we doing here? And you're using a machinery or anything dangerous. She wAs still just unsure. A basic technique is a submodality move. So you sort of sub modalities. Let's go with something that's going on in the background. Um, so it just, it just calms you down so people can use it for, I don't know, before training or stressful day or whatever they want to do. Well, after a stressful day, lunches, you know, get some time to sleep or whatever. So self hypnosis technique correctly, I'm not allowed to share with you. Yeah, please. Okay. So I'm trying to step back a bit. so

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       sit back. Okay. What I want you to do is find a comfortable chair or you can on your bed or whatever, and you while you listen to this, and I want you to yourself just close your eyes a moment. I want you to imagine that your in a room, this room can be an equally you wish and in front of you as a window, the window was slightly open. I want you to move towards that window as you go towards that window. I want you to imagine outside that is traffic, bumper to bumper cars, traffic. When we know what traffic causes, when you're in a traffic jam, you know, in them situations. I also want you imagine that there's a dog running around and barking a really big dog and making lots of noise. There's also a modern woman arguing in the street and I've been a blazing raul the window next door of the house, the 11.

Speaker 2:          01:12:09       They're blaring out really loud music. There's also a group of schoolchildren coming from, but from school I'm making noise. I want you to notice what you notice here, what you hear, and feel what you feel about the situation. With the window open. Now I want you to start moving Backwards further and further away from the window so the window gets smaller and smaller as you move really, really bad from the window I went to allow that window's smaller and smaller as you go. Really wary away from the window, so wIndows really, really small. I want you to walk out that room and closed the door

Speaker 7:          01:12:53       and just be.

Speaker 2:          01:12:58       I'm not saying does it? Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       Skin away from the window. Get away from that window so that she could make a bumper sticker. Get away from the window. He's just so you just so you just withdraw it away from the window all the way from chaos and just quIet and yourself down. So now using that as a, a tool, like how would want implement that in their life like that sort of a.

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       So these, these loads of different ways of, of induction into hypnosis is the, is zillow two different ways with that. I just, I just like it personally, learn off a lady called dolores ashcroft whiskey and just move away from things that are going on and just give yourself like just even a few minutes of just quiet. And when you, when you shut down, you shut the door and he'd just be, you can just imagine yourself sitting and then you can start using your breathing techniques or just allowing yourself to just sit just for a few minutes and see. See what comes up for you. See how calm he can.

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       We were talking about something before the podcast that I wanted to talk to you about. Okay. Uh, in, in, in relationship to archery. and that there is a thing that happens in archery called target panic. And what target panic is people

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       that in the moment they start freaking out and they can't stay calm and they can't they. What they do is they. They try to get that pin, like when when you're shooting a bow that you have a site and on that site has a pin and the pin is it's. It's set up to where whatever yardage you're trying to shoot at and your boat gets cited in and once your boa is cited In, you can kind of dial your scope to or your your site to like 20 yards, 30 yards, 40 yards. And what happens is people put that pin on the target, whether it's at a competition or whether it's bowhunting, whatever it is, you put that pin on a target and the moment that's on the target, you start freaking out because the, the moment that this all is going down is happening soon. And people hammer that trigger on the hammer that trigger, they jerked the pin offline, they don't stay still. They panic. And this target panic causes bad shots. And you introduced me to this idea called hakalau. Hakalau explained to me,

Speaker 2:          01:15:21       hello, how can I always. I'm from a belief system from Hawaii called huna eisa. It's a hypnotic state and I'm nauseous all the time in driving, watching tv, as we said earlier,

Speaker 3:          01:15:34       when you drive and you don't even realize how you got home, you just on autopilot, right?

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       Yes. He just kept no goget. No, that's the word. Yes. And um, he's driving it now. She's basically so huck allow spelling, hakalau, h a, k, h haitian,

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       these motherfuckers and there brutalization of our god given language. How

Speaker 2:          01:15:52       about presidents? Language is hate a k, a l o is it? You've got my dad's gone. The hackle hello? Hello? Kate. J k l a, u l a u? Yeah. So he's, he's a hypnotic state and the, it's quite easy to do. Um, we, I've done it with a lot of people and it works very, very well to use to calm yourself down a little bit. So as I said before, what you do is I'll just sit down and do it. So you're basically using lots of different ways of doing it. You can find a spot on the wall that's higher than your eye line, so you kind of look it up on a diagonal and if you imagine that you can, you're looking for your third eye looking for the middle of your eyebrows and what you do is you focus on a spot on the wall and why are you focusing all your energy on that spot you imagined that you can see all the way to the left and all the way to the right. Imagine that you can see really high above self and below yourself, and then you imagine while you're looking at, you can imagine you can use your awareness to touch everything in the room so you can see behind yourself, very rarely above yourself and below yourself and around yourself. And what that does is it just, it calms you down and gives you a bigger periphery. It's peripheral vision is increasing your peripheral vision, which is extremely good for combat combat athletes, et cetera. And,

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       you know, just being calm and just putting yourself in a common situatIon. Like we talked about, bossy allometry young girl didn't earlier ease and hair color all the time. He's amazing. yeah, he's a pretty bad ass. He's amazing. So explain to me why increasing your peripheral benefits you like what, what does it do? Well, because if you, when people say have tunnel vision, you know, you'll, you'll see that. Why don't you write some of asians like that? you don't see anything else. You see that in street fights, you see the, like, I've, I've talked about this one street fight where, uh, I watched in front of the comedy store. These two guys were arguing and uh, this one guy had zero idea how to fight. I mean like literally zero. And he's standing in front of this other guy and they start throwing Blows. And this guy literally, he's wIncing, his eyes are almost closed and he's doing this because it may, it standing square in front of this guy and is literally like throwing his hands.

Speaker 1:          01:18:06       A bus moves in front of us. I can't see what happens. The bus pulls forth and the guy's flattened, just laying flat out and the other guys were running away, so this guy cracked him. The other guy didn't know what the fuck he was doing either. He was lucky that the first guy over by the bus then. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He just got knocked out on the street. They were in this treat when this happened though, but my point is that you could tell that this guy was frozen in this moment. He wasn't aware of this guy throwing his hands on them and moving his head out of the way and being completely aware most of the time in, in really incredibly stressful situations. Your, your point of vision closes and you tense up. Yeah. So by expanding your peripheral vision, you think you can relax.

Speaker 1:          01:18:54       It could be come on, you come extra law. What is going on? When you're expanding your peripheral vision, putting your unconscious. So say you're opening your unconscious via just like just seeing more than you can actually say. So say if you were in a an archery competition, you're shooting at this target. That's like 70 meters away and you really have to concentrate and you're looking at that spot and you're like, when there's all these nerves and everything like that and you're drawing your bow back and you're constantly on that spot. How would one implement that then? Well, you can do hunkeler. You do that. You do that first. explain that so you find a spot and you find a spot that's higher than the target. FoR instance, say the sockets here, you'd find it's august. That's just above. SaY elvis. okay, so you look for a few feet above the target.

Speaker 1:          01:19:40       Just find a spot. Concentrate on. Just allow yourself to spread your awareness. There's also, there's another way of they get wet. You can have your palms out like this, right? And then when you bring your palms and when you can see out, so you can see, you can see it on palm, you dRop your hands, seven. You'd also put your hand over your hat and then when you, when you can see your fingers over your head, you drop that to so spread. You spread your arms out, you can't see your arms. And then you start bringing them and the moment you

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       see your hands, you drop your hands, but you keep your eyes forward so you keep your eyes focused on wherever that spot is over your head. Then you let your hands down and why is what is going on when I'm doing that

Speaker 2:          01:20:21       based? No. The focus point it just banged awareness picker. Just make sure your site bigger. So when you, when you're in the periphery. Yeah. Have a calmness about you.

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       And what is the philosophy when they talk about hakalau in w? What did you say? The name of the luna. Who knows what is. What is the thought process about hakalau? Is that, is that a part of their practice as part of that practice? You do this thing with their arms.

Speaker 2:          01:20:43       Oh, well no. These loads of different ways of doing. I'm not aware of. They do it with the hands. I know. I just know techniques you've been taught or whatever, but I know that you know the staring at the spot on the wall and allowing your periphery just to spread. Yeah, it works. And what is, what, why is it work? Like what's going on? It calms your mind. And if you're focusing on something. So if you're focusing on, I don't know, whatever you're shooting, right? If you're looking at law and yet you've got this background shit going on, blah, blah, blah. More than likely that ski focus. It's not, that's not your focus guys,

Speaker 3:          01:21:14       the one you're pointing to your head people to listen to and you're saying blah, blah, blah. You mean like the inner dialogue, the chuck, don't fuck this up, don't miss miss. Breathe properly, braised properly.

Speaker 2:          01:21:25       And when you, when you, when you get control of yourself by just focusing your awareness, which is your, your, your, your area said, relax. then you start. Then you just get yourself into a composition.

Speaker 3:          01:21:39       So say if someone was in a hunting situation, there was a deer. the deer is moving to 30 yards away and it's moving right into what you would call it, a shooting lane in between two trees. How would you try to initiate haka loud?

Speaker 2:          01:21:54       Because you do. Before you Started, are you to keep. Practice it all the time. When did you participate? Yes, when you brought it all the time it becomes a part of. Yeah. It's like anything mind coaching or being been using the techniques. I teach people these you got practice, you can't just, I'll just go, hello. And that's it. And you have to practice it and practice it and practice it and it becomes, it becomes more and more. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:17       So this seems like such a simple solution to a very complex issue. There's a lot of what is going on with archery is what's called a. There's a lot of different theories are. One of the theories is w recoil bracing, like you know that something's going to happen so you're preparing for this thing to happen and then in preparing for that thing to happen that is becoming more of your focus then actually making it work correctly.

Speaker 2:          01:22:41       Yeah, but it. But it does calm me down. So even in the aspects of shooting, I'm surely that, I don't know. I don't do it, but I mean surely it's calming down that you're aiming for, for aiming at something. Right? So, but it's also being focused, completely focused on the result and not negative. Just focus your awareness. Yeah. Yeah. the more that you do it, the more people do inspiring as they get less hit. They got, they get less hit inspiring. I know where there's a weight lifter called Emma James, that's, it seems like a 20 old time will have a lifting lady person and um, she uses alcohol and it works. And what does she do? She just basically same thing. Smokers.

Speaker 3:          01:23:24       And are there other methods other than those straight straightening your arms out,

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       looking forward. The best one, my personal opinion, you know, people may argue it, but you know, my personal opinion is you say you folks find a spot on the wall and allow your awareness just a spread. So you imagine you can see all the way to the left and all the way to the right. So you're out in the woods, you pick a spot on a tree. Yeah. And you keep practicing and keep doing it and you will, it will eventually be embedded. So why is expandIng your peripheral vision calming? I don't know, it just, it just seems to calm the whole body down. He sees, again, you're not full. You focusing on spreading your awareness. You're not focusing on panic. Are you focusing on anything else so surely if you're just focusing on seeing and just moving out and so allowing yourself just to spread.

Speaker 2:          01:24:14       I'm doing it now. You know you can just. You can just feel it. WHen I do seminars, which you do a lot of you doing seminar, you're talking to people and this, this and this. you can spot people tHat are wondering mentally so you can see them. Then you just turn it until you understand and then just go. Yeah, because you. You have to. You have to guide the audience. She knows certainly when you're doing comedy, I think you do anyway. I think you'll be doing. You'll do it in comedy. I think when you're on the stage, you'll do it in comedy anyway because you can become a ladder. Everybody sort of. You definitely go into a state of hello is it induces a state.

Speaker 3:          01:24:50       When you're doing comedy, you're in the moment, but you're also a passenger, you know, to do comedy, you almost have to get out of your own way, but you also have to have prepared the material enough to where you know where you're going with it

Speaker 2:          01:25:05       so you can relax. Think about thinking about archery. Then you know you have to go your own way because the only person that's panicking, ego, the animal, all that, whatever you shoot and exactly right, he's exactly the same. You're moving yourself out of the way to get yourself into the zone way you're going to do. Trust me. Just just try it and if you know

Speaker 3:          01:25:23       definitely well, that's an interesting solution to a really common issue with archers like tournament archers, they panic so much that they've come up with a method of allowing this boat to go off without them doing it on purpose. It's a surprise release hypnosis. that's a hypnotic state. Yeah. They have this thing called a hinge release and what a hinge release as you clip it onto your bow and as you pull it back, instead of hitting a trigger, you're slowly moving your hand and you never know when it's going to go off. He just slowly curling your finger and there's a little hinge inside of it and once it gets past a certain point, it just goes off. So instead of like hammering the trigger goes off completely by surprise. So they figured out a solution to whatever this thing is that fucks with people's heads. But what you think is that if you can do It in practice, you can do It in a real life situation. If you expand

Speaker 2:          01:26:23       your peripheral vision, isn't it? Look, you know, like we talked the last time it was unable to talk about golovkin. He talks about feeling innocent. So how he says about about punches, but I feel this, I feel like it says feel all the time and he feels, he feels, I feel this, I know him. I feel he is an awareness. The spansion of awareness. You know, in english. You know that when you flip the bird in english is that it's two fingers, you know what it's from. It's from when we had was with the french or the french, you know the capture, the arches that cut the fingers off. So that's just to say this before. Yeah. Yeah. But that's to do with the to say fuck off. I've got my two fingers and that's from archer. That makeS sense. But it's not a state.

Speaker 3:          01:27:08       Do you know the mongols didn't use it that way. They use their thumb, they hook it with their thumb and then they grabbed their finger like this and they pull it back. That way they had their own little weird because you have a release in your hand. You do it this way because you can get a consistent anchor point. So it's running your chin.

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       If you drop the ball, if you drop the boat, the arrow drops. Yes. Certainly. Yeah. I've heard that one year you have to stay completely still. Is the arrow releases coming from robin hood country as a natural thing? Yeah. It's just, it's.

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       But there's a bunch of different kinds of. Bose is a bunch of different ways of shooting, like when you're shooting with a recurve bow or a traditional bow, you're pulling it back and just letting it go really quickly, bang with, with a compound bow, you're settling in and relaxing and trying to stay calm and keep the pin relatively close to the area, but concentrating on the spot and then you release and as you release, it's got to be in one smooth motion with your hand pulls back as you do it. So there's no yanking this way of pulling that way or there's nothing that's gonna affect the travel of the arrow

Speaker 2:          01:28:14       level that there's a lot of minDset going into a level of self trust. Isn't aware that there's a big level of self trust and not saying anything small or anything else. He said, learning to trust yourself and trusting your, trusting your mind. You know, and, and I just think that with, with mine coaching stuff, with techniques that you know, that you get to learn and get to, to having your locker, I think it's massively beneficial as you're alive. You will do it. I mean if you, you know, I can always record something and send you it before you go to this thing that you're doing and see what happens. I'd be interesting for me to see what happens because I've never worked with anyone in the zone archery. It is. It is a lot of preparation for one moment.

Speaker 3:          01:28:56       Might happen once a year and that's one of the big things about it is like when someone prepares for like a bow hunt in particular, the lease a tournament, you have multiple shots, you can shoot many, many times you get more relaxed, but when someone prepares for a hunt, you are preparing year round. You're shooting arrows constantly. It's, it's, it's an. I can't believe how hard it is. I mean when I first started doing and I was like, what's the big deal? You stand there, you keep your arms straight, you pull the bow back. No, there's a lot going on and there's so much to consider. The position, the placement of your feet, the position of your front shoulder, how you're gripping the bow, pulling back to the same consistent anchor point, looking through the peep site correctly, Make sure you send her the peep site with the site housing on the bow releasing with no movement whatsoever, making sure that everything is done perfectly and keeping the mind concentrating specifically on a spot. You have to look where you want to hit. You can't look in the vague area and you can't hope you're going to hit something. You have to be absolutely convinced you're going to hit something.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       Yeah, and you will. You will look at you positive thinking, you will. You will, because that's the intention. So if your intention set your intention, set your site, which is exactly the same as it not set your sight on right, and this is what I'm going to do set you say on your intention where you go and say, this is what I'm going to do. Set your intention and that is a big part of why people fuck up. They go, I hope this works. This works. The even said that strikes part, do or do not, there is no try. You know, you set your intention. I know it's cliche, but you know, we set your intention will a lot of times cliches are there for a reason, but they're the, they're real. They represent reality. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:30:35       Yeah, and I think in this one it does. It's, it's just an extreme thing and it's also a thing of this archery thing and bowhunting in particular where a lot of people who are engaging in it, they might not have a lot of experience in performing under extreme pressure. Yeah. So you don't have a lot of opportunities where you're performing under extreme extreme pressure and then you have an incredibly intense moment where it's literally life or death to this animal.

Speaker 1:          01:31:01       Yeah. Yeah. But at least we'll talk and we'll talk because they want you to change the language around it to give you a motor, the motor. Because it is complicated. I get la please. We got to make it as less complicated as we can. So it's. So it's a smooth thing. You said it's complicated, but it's not complicated like the english language, the english language is unbelievably complex. Thousands of letters and I mean thousands of words and you're, you're using them all in different ways and inflection and we all do that effort. So think I think, I think you can, you know, we're doing the techniques and helping you out. My certainly. Well, because you know, you're a very nice man. I'll give you credit for sure. I want you to. I want to, I really wanted to talk to you about this because I've seen all these different methods that people use to try to overcome target panic and one of them is um, a positive affirmation or positive, a way of looking at it.

Speaker 1:          01:31:57       Like my friend shane dorian was here and he was talking about his friend and his friend right before he goes to shoot the arrow. And he said his friends are really nice guy. His friend says, I'm going to fucking kill you. That's what he says in his head, I'm going to fucking kill you. Like he says that in his head. He's absolutely convinced this is what he's going to do. It's not. I hope this arrow lands perfectly. I hope I make a great shot. He affirms in in his head where there's no wishy washiness about it. When I send intention, yeah, I'm a full and you said you, you, you. And they said, when you change the language around, when he changed the language around anything, it becomes, it becomes more useful to you. You know Lisa Dennis that I said, he said, yeah, it's an affirmation, but it's also setting your intention in every way.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       If you think about it, she did not. Bow is setting your intention and every single light, isn't it? Because yOur intention is the beast, if you will, and you're setting your intention so you've got a calm this. Yeah, we'll. Yeah, we'll, we'll get it. We'll get it. We'll get it. Well, I would really like to see if this is effective or if it helps other archers because that's one of the things that me getting involved in bow hunting or been exposed to this common problem that people talk about it. I'm absolutely fascinated by common problems. The problems that seem to represent a pattern of thinking that's really almost natural, but obviously should be avoided. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's just about you focusing your attention on what you want. That sounds. That'S how you get things in life. You focus on what you want, not what you don't want.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       You focused on totally on up and you will get things that will trip you. Don't live on a cloud and never, never, never say that. What you do is you focus on what you want and you keep focusing on what you want and to deal with things that get in your way, but keep focusing on what you want. That's the. That's the. I don't focus on the problems. Focus on what you want. Focus on how difficult is this problem and how difficult it says, because all of you telling you you're, you're all you're doing, you're young conscious. Then you only formation. You've given it some harder it. So then what does it become? It become something that becomes something huge, and this comes back to what we were talking about, the very beginning of this podcast. The language that you use in your own mind can be very self-defining and can sort of really not just define you, but define your future and how you, how you interact with life and I didn't tell people I interview are you get you come across a now you perceive yourself in order to projects everything into, into what happens, you know, and I think that's the idea if it's, is just changing the language, the way you speak to yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:34:44       if you can change the language ways you speech of your life will change exponentially. That's my change. The language folks change the language and obviously this is also, it's not an instantaneous process, right? He's practice.

Speaker 2:          01:34:59       The first time you did spend in bucket, you didn't land on the target and was brilliant like a senior wiley and now buck. Well ian's and other british to wellbeing. What does that. Oh well eating. Well he is a is a wellington. I don't know, it's just the slang term for kicking. Very welli when you kick, when your well eat something, you kick in it because you know wellington boots. Oh, okay. So yeah, but when i'Ve seen you, you know, the senior that spinning back, kick it out, usually showing john same per judge. St louis. That was right. You know, so first time you did that, you didn't do correctly. Nobody. It's all about practice in mind. Coaching isn't an instantaneous thing for phobias. Yes. Works. Yes, but I mean for, for certain things in life, you've got to, you've got to keep doing it. It's just nice thing is practice, you know?

Speaker 3:          01:35:49       Yeah. And that's the case with everything, including thinking, thinking is a skill. Yes. I'm thinking of something that you have to develop and develop proper technique and adhere to these proper techniques. Always.

Speaker 2:          01:36:05       Yes. That's why I don't do one offs. I used to do one off, so he used to be one off sessions for people, like one to ones and do a session one session. I don't do one anymore. I do more do thinG called four weeks to freedom on our people that sign up for a year with me as well because he seeks it an ongoing process. I sTill love it. My, my teacher column, mci, I still, I still pull up ruminate things and he puts my thinking on the right path or whatever east. No one's. We're not a finished products. I'm certainly not a finished product, you know, but it's just about practice.

Speaker 3:          01:36:38       That's really what's important. Like people would try to point out inconsistencies in someone's behavior as a sign that maybe that person shouldn't be the one that's being a mental coach, like yourself or someone who is maybe not succeeded in everything they've ever tried. How could this person possibly be a mental coach when they're not even capable of running their own light, but know that every human being is essentially the same in that regard is that no matter where you are, you could probably do better and no matter who you are, you have learned along the way. A lot of it by failure.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Yeah. I'm going back as well because I'm fumbling because he does things that I think you'll change the face of parks and I really do. Why do you think that? I've seen what he does. He does like the short test. Have you seen that or he does the different numbers. What he's like, he's a short test way. You wanted 25 and they're all in a square and then they see this. All the numbers are in squares as well and he has to touch them and. Oh, I see what you're saying. It just loads of different mind. Stuffy reaction drill. Yeah, but he's. He's building his awareness. He's building his intelligence. That's why he's called himself hightech. He's building his intelligence. He's building his awareness. He said, then these next fight he's not going to get here, is not to get hit. What happens? Was he his head, you have a pull thing.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       He's got. He's got a mind coach, he's got a mind coach and when he lost the salito, nobody got like where the weight was wrong and he got punched in the balls and all that sort of stuff in salita just out of our program. Rarely I guess he's too heavy, this, this and this, but he didn't dwell on that. He went back straight away. Beat Gary Russell. He's a great fight. It's so under each because he didn't dwell on it because he had a mind coach saying, look, control your emotions mean brian tolbert of consuMer. We're talking about. I read about that. He was saying that his Mind coAch got him to not focus just to control his emotions and that's what it's about is controlling your emotions, controlling your, controlling you, because you are your emotions after all and just getting free. What other People wouldn't and he isn't. He fighting salito in a rematch. isn't that? I think it's muted, but I don't. I've heard also that you're going to move up to lightweight and fight. Manchester's a sonny terry flanagan for the Wbl title, uh, next year. Interesting. But he's amazing. I've never seen anyone do what he does. I'm putting out, which was very good. Roy jones was very good, but he just seems to glide around people and just, it just seems to know what you're going to do before you do it. He's exceptional.

Speaker 1:          01:39:03       What's exceptional about him is that he's not outside. He's inside and he's not getting hit. Yeah. That's one of the most impressive things about him is that he stays in the pocket in any somehow is so slick and so, so well schooled by his father as well. Right? Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people were disappointed. and andre ward's performance on saturday night. I think the opponent had a lot to do with it. Um, I think against, I think gangs kovalev it will be very, very interesting. Yeah. Well what's, here's trinkle standing right in front of this dude. Just beautiful counters, man. It's just so crazy. Like, like he's just not there when the guy goes to hit him. So he's insane how good he is. He's so aware though. He says awareness is awareness is so perfect, is distance and he's timing. And what did he fight for?

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       A world title fight and his second profile. Yes. Yeah, and he's won two worlds out. The different weights and seven fights. He's just so good at is his movement is so incredible. You know, you see a guy like lowman chenko and you see gennady golovkin and kova live and you go, god damn, these russians are bad motherfuckers. Mind coaches, all of them maybe even the russians used, were the first people to start using, you know, mental couches and stuff. This footwork is insane. And again, like what's insane about it is he's right in front of the guy and yet he's so elusive with his footwork, who that step to the right upper cut step to the left, upper cut. Just god damn. He's good. And he pulls the hands as well. Pose the hands down and frozen. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's really good at that.

Speaker 1:          01:40:43       He's a, he's a freak. He's a real freak. And so these russians, they, that's the way they school. They're amateurs. They, they give them a lot of mind. Yeah, they do. And launch uncle also was doing gymnastics and ballet. Ballet, ballet is coming up again, isn't it? You know, tumeric, tumeric and so. Well, I would think that that would help because just the ability to control your body. Gymnastics in particular is fantastic for that. The ability to, like hixon gracie famously was into yoga and he was into this very specific type of yoga that's very gymnastics oriented. Gymnastic on natural. And, uh, there's a lot of flexibility and movemenT. It's more of like a flowing type of yoga thing, but it's just the movements and those flowing type movements are one of the reasons why he was so good at jujitsu is because his ability to control his body was truly exceptional and he had very unusual ability to control his body awareness, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       It's also strength in weird motions. Yoga is a big part of that too. He was, he was also a yogi and let, not just gymnastic and natural, but like regular yoga he could do just to had incredible flexibility standing on a balance beam, standing in a full split, holding his foot above his head, you know, and he's 200 pounds and he's fighting professionally and valley tudo events. It'S all mind and body connection states. he's getting you in conjunction with strength and conditioning. So great as well as these loads of stuff. Now this make it can make athletes like incredibly, incredibly successful llama llama, chanko mad gulf kitten matt. He's fighting kell brook soon in england. September the 10th in london aPparently. Um, they, they don't. A 30 day wayne think and brooks heavier than heavier right now than triple j. Yeah, it'd be good. Good luck with all that because.

Speaker 1:          01:42:46       Or should it be savvier? Yeah, no, I know, but I really. Well, because he's english guy. I like him. Beverly's laverty windsor knot up. Well, he's got a chance. He's a professional boxer and he's excellent. Gennady golovkin something special. There's something hit. His body attack is fucking ruthless to man that left hook to the liver. He throws good lord and the way it cuts the ring down. And, and I, I just liked him as a Person. He's not the most, the most sparkling personality, however, but I mean I just like him the way he says. I respect. He's old school. I respect him and blah blah blah. What's interesting about him to me is that he's so boyish and cute looking, but he's a fucking killer. I mean, you look at the guy he's like, and he's like, I bring big drama fight. He had been threatened.

Speaker 1:          01:43:35       Yeah. Big drama show. It's so strange. he had a very, very special. Yeah, he is. He is. Well, so is kovalev. And that's why the andRe ward five becomes so, so intriguing because if he fights the way, if andre ward fights away, fought on saturday night, going to have a real hard time with kobo, last fight against chill amber. It didn't look all that. But she'll amber again. See, I think it was fighting in Russia. There was a lot of pressure on him as well, you know, I mean fight. I mean tony bell for him twice from england now. The wbc cruiserweight champion from liverpool, which I remember was the only guy to go the distance except hopkins. Right. In recent fights in recent fights. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think you dropped something round seven. I think world will fight on the inside. I don't think you'll find on the outside.

Speaker 1:          01:44:23       I think you'll find similar to the way for french. I think that's. That will Be the plan book. Great fight of flight. A very, very interesting fight where I lack of award. His intelligence. He's so smart and you hear it when he does commentary. Yeah. He's so aware. Any fights. So smart. Yeah. He just, he's just a very clever guy. And everything he does, he makes it awkward. He fights different, almost every fight. Sometimes he fights in the outside. Sometimes he sticks to you like glue. It's, he's a very interesting fighter seeing jim lampley. I'm asking him questions and he, I think he, he was an addict, so have some soul and died really elephant data. 40 sex. And his mom was a former drug addicts and jim lampley astia and you could see him like, well open, you know, he started crying and stuff and he's come through shit, you know, so you know, we need.

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       He's still quite, he wants to listen to nothing but respect for him. He's amazing and he's, he seems, and I've not met him at like to a very, very nice one. Decent human being. When he fought the last time when he fought on a second. I know his first name is [inaudible]. Second name was barrera. He won't play where he caught it. He caught the jap chap coat the job for a right anD left talk slips on. Wow. I mean it was just like, he's just like, he's dancing. He's liking to. Hearst is fabulous. Hawk, alo, kakao indeed.

Speaker 1:          01:45:45       Are there any other, um, methods of trying to expand your peripheral? Uh, basically practice, just practice. So it's just something that you have to be aware of. The closing of the peripheral is also a tightening of you and not good. I would say so. But you could still focus even with expanded peripheral yet you could still focus on the task at hand. If you do focus on the task at hand, he still is still focusing on the task and hand stride drive is the same, isn't it? I mean if he was just driving and just look forward, you know, you wouldn't see anything coming from a junctIonal. You still look in the rear view mirror, don't you? even though you're not really going to get, you're not gonna get more often than not. You're not going to hit behind unless you stopped, you know? YeAh. That's the uh, the stereotype about asians being bad drivers. A friend of mine who's asian tried to tell me the reason for that is their culture when they're in asia, especially in, in, in, in China. Nobody looks to the left and look to the right. It's like traditional to

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       look straight ahead and uh, do you mind your own business? Don't be staring, don't look off to the left. And so and also they run Into each other like, have you ever been on the streets of China? Apparently according to ari, they just, people just bumping into everybody. They just bump into each other. They're just so used to it. It's not a rudeness thing. It's just, that's normal to them. So when they get in their cars, they kind of do the same thing. It looks straight ahead. They don't look to the left, don't look to the right and just plow ahead. Was not good for driving.

Speaker 2:          01:47:16       I was hustling, I was in Hong Kong and I was trying to get a flight service with k one. It was a disaster, but I was trying to get the flight from Hong Kong to grandchild this place and they almost took the they desk explaining the answers, get this flight quick. I was running through the, I felt like it was intake and I was wondering about approach and the journey is just people's barging in front of you go, you know what she goes, I don't know. And then Jeremy Melendez, kid who I know from a lives in Hong Kong, you were saying that the mainland chinese, uh, miles different than the people from Hong Kong. You have a different sort of, you know, um, values and culture, different sort of. Well, Hong Kong was a british empire, right? Well still 1999 years. That's ridiculous. Why would they give it back? Oh no, fuck no, fuck no.

Speaker 2:          01:47:57       All toys are made in Hong Kong. They great. Yeah. Well it used to be one thing that english people do. They'll say somethIng and you ask a question. He's doing great, isn't he? The welsh do it as well. She has a lounge thing. Yeah. The wells do though. I noticed you used to do that a lot. Well, you still do in commentary, you'll say something very complImentary and then you say, isn't he? Yeah, I see it isn't even that. So let's just get an agreement. Unless it's we have julie kitchen over compensate with a lot or garbage starrett who would take common site with your cow that, you know, I am asking them for. It doesn't need reassurance because I'm insecure. Insecure thing is a blanket that I need words.

Speaker 3:          01:48:35       Again, going back to what we talked about, like language defining things. It's like you're defining the fact that even though you are observing things, you are, you're, you're being conversational about it and you're not being, you know, you're not like the authoritarian. You're not like the authority of all information is being passed. Are you saying you're looking for a consensus?

Speaker 2:          01:48:56       Yeah, of course. Because when you, when you come and say it, and I know in, in, you know, I'll come commentary is you've got to be careful with your language. You've got to, you've got to engage that, engage the audience to drag them into something just in a fight. You know, you've got to, you've got to it. While I'm bit more spectacular anyway because I'm a bit high for, um, I'm based off, you know, a bit squeaky, but I'm like baker off of violet beaker off the moffitt, but it's like, you know, you often drug the, the audience in and I think it's nice. Chavela is great. Attack. Chavela was gray. Yeah, he's a fantastic. Yeah. It's like a whole litany of phrases that he loves to use. Makes you jump. Yeah. So you see it makes it, makes you, makes you jump as well. So he'll say stuff that's on his mind, like swearing and. Yeah. For to know. We're talking, we're

Speaker 1:          01:49:47       talking about my friend michael chavela who does commentary for access tv. He does lion fight, which is the premier organization in the United States, at least for moitai and the rest of the world that she aka. Yeah. That sold with the sixth liam harrison fights. Fabio pinker who soda is the, a conor mcgregor and nate diaz. Pharaohs. Yeah. That's, it's to me stunning that moitai isn't more popular worldwide, but boxing is more. Thai is so much more exciting than boxing. There's so many more variables. It's so, so many more ways to win. It's so much more effective and it's just brilliant to watch. When you watch a guy like sam chai or yachts and cli or someone, all the greats book cow, you watch these guys fight and the artistry and the beautiful techniques and moves and also the excitement, the excitement of more tie. It's just so spectAcular.

Speaker 1:          01:50:47       Some sunshine law, oliver, but he's like, you know, we'd, we'd. Liam knows we a big fanboy of lee and he brings a stone. Never really. It never leaves anything behind a brings a stone. I don't tell him what a state is going to be. Wicked account. I'm sweating in the hands. Start sweating and own salsa. So childish. I really do need to grow uP and get a proper job. no, you don't. I'm sanchez. Interesting too, because he's. He's really light on his feet. He fights different than most ties. Like he fights on the balls of the feet, almost exclusively utilize a lot of front side kicks, like sort of a hat. It's like half tepe kick have front leg side keeps you off balance a lot more, but ron isn't, I mean sunshine I think was trying to originally by a guy called some rock come sing who won an olympic gold medal as well, and he's got a very flamboyant, sent naked, amazing skilled.

Speaker 1:          01:51:43       Does that. The guY that was supposed to fight john claude van damme was the one in las vegas. Yeah. Him that was never going to happen. Right. And um, he, he was east. So, um, uh, again, he's aware but he's rock hard as well. I mean, you think he's just messing about, but he's robbing me and I'm watching again watching him. Liam. Liam smashed. He's from like tibet and he's just had a counter as well as kicking them as odd as a coach. And he's still still, he's a. yeah, he's a very special. He's thIrty, he's 36. He's not, he's not getting any younger. He just got involved in a mma. He's been training. There's some videos of him doing arm bars and stuff. It's interesting because you gotta wonder like if that's what he's deciding to do. And he fights all the time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:27       That's the other thing. Like I follow him on instagram and chai will have this thing like about to fight, smile, smile, fist, bicep. He's fighting. No emojis. Some of the 11th in england because you want to again, kit mentioned kevin kettle and he's, they just sell. But um, charlie peters, he's fighting charlie while he fights, you know, at least six times a year. Easy, easy say hey, fault and gloria didn't he in amsterdam one. And that's kickboxing roles without the clench. Without elbows. Yep. Which is, it's interesting that they chose those rules. I don't, I'm not a big fan of that. I'm a big fan of the organization, but I like elbows. I think elbows are. I mean, look, if you can kick some in the head why? Yeah. Album, it's very effective when we're talking about moitai. Like why, why, why limit it, you know, why allow like leg kicks, knees the head, head kicks, but don't allow elbows.

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       That seems to me to be a little weird thing that one thing that keeps keeps more tie back is the traditional side of it, which I love. I love my crew, my crew, the can on the hand hold it back though because people, this is my opinion. I may be wrong, but he's like, you know, people will sit there and they get the bear or whatever and they come in and they watch the fights and then they just say, well on. He said we are a funder of martial arts so you're not going to really see what they see, but I can see it from a, you know, what's that? It's got a nice head for and what's up music. Why they done seen was odd and also the music while they're actually fighting is a little odd. But if you watched it you wouldn't hear it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:59       I don't hear it. Yeah, I was, you know, and if you listen for it, you obviously eric's focus, but I love it only so great fight is coming through and in england and everywhere else and great things up with will thai boxing council at thai boxing association at brian dell was involved in loads of stuff coming through. she's good. Your cow and you know and lights said lion fight him on barlow. He's one of my friends. She's fighting a lion fight. She's amazing. She's fighting so she will love her. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm just happy to. Lion fight exists because it seems like there's so few organizations that are showing high level more tiny United States. I mean if it wasn't for mark cuban's access tv, it's like there's not, there's not any other options. Mia, there's some good fight as a gust on bolinas. Very gOod.

Speaker 1:          01:54:44       I like him. He's great. He's only other fee for us. He's rock hard and he think he's six, six and won. He lost one fight and it was a very highly disputed decision law against the tie content, but it's difficult. I've watched it once and it's close enough to watch it again to really solve, analyze it by like his style. I liked it. Comes for his fight and he's only had a few fights. I think. Hopefully you'll be fine. You'll find in england and soon enough. Yeah, and of course Kevin Ross who said very fun to watch too. Yeah, he's. He's highly skilled and zoya. Frau is fighting and glory and he's Kevin Ross has also funny and build toward kickbox too, right? Yeah. Please. Just seeing these sudanese last one and he's still a little bit more tight. It's very difficult to fight that style, but I will obviously is.

Speaker 1:          01:55:34       We have a good gym, so the transition not transition. Isn't it funny that the two most people that it looks like the same thing. They'll look at it like whAt's the difference? And you know the. The clench is a big factor in the elbows are a big fan of the stance as well. The, the pace, the stands, you know giorgio petrosyan, you could find some way tie style, but he can eat adopted the rules very well because of his boxing skill. How, what does Georgia up to now he's fighting soon in ballot or I don't know why, because he had that one devastating loss to devastate you and diversity is amazing. production up close. I've never seen anybody like that. Just slips shots and just luns and when he hits, when he lands with these countless, they're not. They're not soft delight, whack. You know you're in a position where you can't hit him and he can hit you.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       He's just poetry. Emotion is absolutely super interesting too because it is not like some physical specimen or anything like that. It's just an average guy, but she's a very intelligent approach to finding how color is eyesight. I mean these nobody's high site is because he's so focused on what he does and even what you're trained in, everything is specific is a south pole as well, which you kind of limit the shots or what you can at the south pole with you know our sap or connect you with an east. Just got that down to a fine art and so's marciel. He says they've got that to a fine art that the account was at yoga and for all the, all the, they've seen it lots and lots of times. Whereas if you haven't spotted lots of samples and spent time with them than it is difficult for you to adjust to, you know, white cubans, you have so many pass because of the styles.

Speaker 1:          01:57:09       Difficult to contend with sometimes. Yeah. It is funny that more people don't do it. They don't compete as a southpaw. There's a lot of teachers that are starting to teach, like emmanuel steward was doing that towards the end days was a teaching guys to fight with their strong hand forward. So he's taking right handers and having to fight southpaws. Yeah. Well the cutouts are left handed or left handed off. A duck's Delaware is lefthanded fight in an orthodox stance. So he'd have his left arm, which is his dominant hand forward. Andre ward. He's lefthanded, but I don't know whether or not. It's interesting though, isn't it, to make that decision to use your dominant hand as your front hand when everybody else uses it as the power hand the backhand. Yeah, I mean, I don't know, it feels a bit, but then again it would feel weird if you don't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:58:00       This is like anything. It's everything feels weird. ReMember the first time you tried to throw a left hook, you're like, what? Yeah, I'm lefthanded anyway. Sorry. Yeah, so he's. He's always been so always been a right hook first year, but I remember first time throwing a hook, thinking like what a bizarre way to generate power and now it's second nature. Now it just feels like you just, you know it. Your body just moves that way. I think john wayne pass lefthanded. Izzy, can you watch you on every doc? He's lucky he's left kick, but he trained with santee and noi for many years and sanction knows something. He knows his alphabet. Joan, my passcode. Great. Left cake. Yeah, we're slowly starting to see real high level more thai fighters compete in mma and really more so in women's mma and I mean we have a lot of high level people in the men's mma of course, But in women's mma to on jacob.

Speaker 1:          01:58:56       What am I saying? Her name? Right? You wanna young, young jay. Check. Why am I saying it wrong though? Young, young jet. Check, check. Yeah, but why am I saying it wrong? It's one of those words were, if you don't, if you don't say it for a couple of days, you go back to it and go. You want everybody says yohanna to which actually you want to young jay check thing. I'm saying it right. Feel off. It's so different between the way she says it. She says it. You're like, ooh, I don't even know if I can make that noise in my face. You see why questions things? See, here's the thing. When you look at it right there, first of all, what the fuck is going on with that? Why is that? He have a goatee like that does not help me at all.

Speaker 1:          01:59:39       Like if she's. If you pull up her name and you make me re say her name or it doesn't help me at all, but whatever. She's fucking awesome. Which she is, is. She's really incredible like her. Her, her technique or jab is just vicious. She steps forward and blast that stiff jab on girls. Her front kicks her round, kicks her, her elbows when she's defending takedowns, her clinch work. May god, she's good. She's so good. She's one of the most technical strikers in any division and she's in women's mma. Of course. Volunteership chanko of course, very, very accomplished moy thai fighter who's now fighting in women's mma. Yeah. There's some good coaches coming. Frivolous. Bryan pope, jelly as well from boxing. He's really good. I watched him on patsy of the day and he what he's doing, he's a good. He's a good coach. Go to the elbows and good with timing and all that sort of business.

Speaker 1:          02:00:36       what do you think that more time needs in order to become as popular in the United States as it is in other parts of the world? You a chance, right? Accounts. It's not fun. It's not as if they got not got decent people with it. I'm here because let's say joe, sheldon and amy can come in here with you, which is brilliant. Thanks very much, but I've come to see brian doebele from wls, my tie and east east full face light, million miles an hour of everything. And where's that? Uh, in fontana and uh, in California and they, you know, the, I've got the talent. It's just a chance. I actually don't know. I think he's a lot of politics involved or you know, they're not getting the smokers have been a band, you know, the, the, uh, qualified. Yeah, we call them into clips. They're banned everywhere. California, I think California, which is unfortunate because our, they're going to get experience.

Speaker 1:          02:01:31       They're not, but they're also, they're not going to die. That's all people were worried about was some of it. Some people were being unethical and they're smokers or they didn't have a proper medical staff on think someone got hurt and an mma smoker. And I think that they kind of polluted everything a bit loud. People get hurt in the gym, the gym in the washing machine. But I'd love it to have a chance. I think it should be bigger in the United States and they need to compensate from england by the way. I agree, I really do think that it should be bigger than the United States and I do think that it's not something that's. It's not like cricket, like good luck selling that, but it's something that's universally exciting. I know you guys will enjoy cricket. I don't even. I don't even know what it means.

Speaker 1:          02:02:14       I don't even know anything about it. Congratulations this far. I'll football or american football or baseball league, but moitai is universally exciting. If you watch it, it's universally exciting and in my opinion it's one of the most effective combat sports and as itself as an individual unit. Yeah. Y'all call. Well, I worked for amazing and fusion that I will, I, I, I'm very privileged to work for them to of high level stuff. I love it. I mean infusion fusion of the best new commerce, the, you know, the new kids on the block coming through. They're amazing. These moroccans are rock hard and england, you know, with, with the car when children watson liam and panic costs and all of guilt guys coming phrase wicked. I love it. Well listen, I hate to cut this off but I gotta get the fuck outta here, but I really appreciate you coming down here.
