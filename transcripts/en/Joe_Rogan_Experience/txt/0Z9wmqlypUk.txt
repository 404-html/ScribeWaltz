Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Is it recording? Yes. Good. Okay. Beautiful. Yeah, we always have these things where it's three hours. I'm like, God, it, we can, uh, you know, at least you don't have a 30 or 60 minutes show. They have to put your commercials in the middle and everything. By the way, I'll give a plug for legal zoom that when I first came to California it took me two days in a law library to get up to speed so I could write my will and uh, I was glad to see that there's still a discount with Rogan cause that's my project this month is to Redo my will and leave, you know, I've, I've known about legal zoom for a long time and is a really good group. That's another thing that I think the internet sort of made a lot easier finding out what your rights are, finding out how the law of lawyers mainly know how to use the library and have their secretaries type of things, you know, because they gotta go by so and so legal zoom can take care of probably 95 percent of all your stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Did you go from being a lawyer to running a computer company? Well, I was, uh, I was practicing law in Houston and uh, we had primarily a business law. Uh, my partner and I owned a title insurance company and we're doing, it was in the heyday in Houston when the savings and loan thing was going on, but, uh, one day our main client came in and he had a big construction company and he wanted to sue one of his subcontractors and, you know, I looked at all and I said, well, Jeremy, I know you, you can file a lawsuit but you're not going to win because he's in the right here. He says, oh, I know that. I just want to hurt him. So I said, give me just a minute. I walked around to the next office, to my partner. I said, figure out what my share of the south is worth.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       I quit, I'm going home. And that was when I, I just, I, it'd been building up to that because I've been doing stuff that I didn't become a lawyer to hurt people and do stuff like that. And so, uh, I just walked away from it and uh, had gotten locked involved in multilevel marketing. Wow. And uh, yeah, uh, what I found out is, is that if you say, Hey, I'm a lawyer and I'm doing this, people just flock to you, you know, I have lots of people. And because you're a lawyer doing well, they say, well, if a lawyer is doing it, you know, it's got to be great. So is it like a pyramid scheme? Pyramid come. Yeah, we're selling a do it yourself at home facelifts.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       It was, it was before anybody knew about aloe. Vera was one of the first aloe companies and it was really easy to sell. We do a meeting and a bunch of people to be there and you'd paint half their face with this stuff and leave it on for like 30 minutes and take it off. And it looked like there to patient one side's a little higher. And yet sort of like putting a, what's that hemorrhoid medicine in your face or something. But what's hemorrhoid preparation? Preparation H, yeah, it happens when you put. It just tightens you up. It tightens your skin up for an hour or so. When you put aloe Vera, this was a whole bunch of it. It actually did work. It did tighten up your skin and get rid of some wrinkles for the evening. Yeah. Oh yeah. It worked for the evening.

Speaker 1:          00:02:52       For the evening. Yeah. It wasn't pretty. But uh, and, and we sold a whole variety of things. Why don't like actors do that before they make movies, I think get this stuff and you can't get a hold of era anymore. You can get elevated. But this was, this had some powders and stuff. You use a chemical thing. What happened to the surface now people say no, the company went out of business. Uh, you know, there, there's all these, you know, I, I know a lot about these multilevel companies. They, they all spring from a vitamin company, a neutral light, I think it's called. And that's where the, uh, device and Van Andel it started a amway came true light. Yeah. I think amway finally bought them or something like that. But what's that big one? That's a big one with the leaves that. Oh, that's a uh, I'll think of it in huge company.

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       Yeah. Well, anyhow, herbalife, herbalife, in fact, one of the first vice president came out of this company. I was in a ideal incorporated, but there was a dare to be great and cause caught. And uh, one that, uh, the California governor campaign, that guy. Anyhow, I used to know a whole lot about this and they all sprung from the same core of people at one time. They all knew each other and I got involved in that for awhile and we were selling all kinds of thing. And then my partner and I started a jewelry company and we kind of fell out and I was into computers. So I started a computer company. It was a pyramid company and uh, you know, it, it was a lot of fun. But, uh, you know, I finally lost the faith because for awhile I really believed that you could do these things.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       You know, we had a, a woman who was a German refugee that wound up making $20,000 a month and stuff like that. And so those things did happen, but they were so rare. Finally, uh, you know, I was able to see the light. Well, it happened after I started taking Mtma. That's when I got out of the motivational business and everything. And the motivational business, that's a slippery business. It's fascinating to me. People that have never been successful at business but give motivational seminars on how to be successful at business. After my computer company crashed. That's what I got into. That's a fascinating thing, isn't it? That people would. It's sort of like, you know, like there's comedy classes that are taught by extremely unfunny people. I believe people that have never had a career as a comedian, but they decided to start teaching comedy and then they started making more money teaching comedy than they ever did doing comedy itself.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       Yeah. It's like a lot of that. Back in Boston, there was a guy that was terrible comedian who was teaching the local comedy class. I was like, that doesn't make any. Like, what the fuck was going on here? You couldn't get a real comedian to teach a comedy class. They didn't want to have any part of it and you'd be surprised how many motivational speakers are great depression all the time. You know, we'd, we'd go back after the thing would be over. We'd get off stage, Oh gee, my wife is leaving me and you know, all these. We had more problems than our audience combined probably. But you had some good ideas. He just had to figure it out. Yeah. You know, they were all, you know, from 100 years ago, you know, there's not much new in that field. It's a. well, Anthony Robbins is another one.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       Right. Tony Robbins, he's a super successful at that. But what else has he done? I mean, is he like, had like a successful real business. You know, when he first came in the scene, I just started kicking myself because I said, gosh, I was doing that and I'm better than him. He's very handsome or beautiful teeth. Oh yeah. He's in, he's got. He has a lot more confident than I was a booming voice. Throws karate kicks, but you know, eventually you kind of push yourself to. Then he started doing all the firewalking and stuff like that and yeah, that's firewalk hey, my wife did it and did not get burned the first time you could do it and knock it burn to. Oh well no. You Walk Quick. I could not do it. I'm not going to walk on fire barefoot, but if you did, you'd be all right. The whole idea is getting through quickly. If I did, I know I'd get through all right because I wouldn't do it unless I was sure I was going to get through. All right. Um, you could think that you are going to be all right and not be all right. But that's what happened the second time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       How far did she walk longer? The second time I think was probably the same. Real? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean I didn't know her then. I probably shouldn't be talking about it. I get it symbolically. You. No, but unless it's fuckery. Like we all know fire burns are wise finding out brand because I don't believe it's going to burn. Oh boy. I'm not sure about that. I think you might be playing games here. Oh, you know, the three laws of taking psychedelics are, number one, cars are real. Number two, fire burns, and number three, gravity is still a law. If you lift as those three things, you can't go wrong. That's like the bill Hicks joke. Did you ever the bill Hicks choke on acid? Thought he could fly, jumped off the building, and he's like, if he thought he could fly, what did he take off from the ground?

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       I didn't hear the last a moron. I remember that. That's. It's so logical. It is logical. It's like, wait a minute. That guy was an asshole. He was a Houston Guy, right? Yeah. See I, I left Houston by then when I was going to law school in Houston. Uh, the only celebrity I saw that wasn't a celebrity then was Glen Campbell was, was singing for tips in this bar. I used to. But uh, I, I used to hang out and lightning hopkins bar. He was a black, a blues guy and uh, a couple of us would go down to Houston. Yeah. Yeah. He was that down in the fifth ward somewhere, we'd have to go into a little group, but we went regularly enough that we got known were the only white kids in there, you know, and so, uh, one and he'd, you know, he'd wrapped with us and stuff and I said, hey, I can play the spoons.

Speaker 1:          00:08:20       And he says, give the boys some spoons, get up here. And so I started playing the spoons while he's playing guitar, you know, and he stops and he says, you're in law school right now? I said, yeah. He says, go back to law school. You'll never make it as a musician. What an asshole. Oh No, no. He did it in a funny way and I know he was, he was actually right. I couldn't keep a beat. You know, Houston had two of the greatest comedians of all time come out of it. Sam kinison and building it in. Yeah, that's right. They had that whole Houston annex down back and then they had like a real creative group of young up and coming comedians and they, you know, they started this thing that

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       Houston comedy outlaws. And it was Hicks and Kennison and a bunch of other guys. Fascinating sort of a development. I went to law school there in Houston and I taught sailing at Houston Yacht Club. That's how I got there because of Kennison. They all had like this unique style that's very aggressive in your face. Thoughtful style of, of breaking things down in a very logical way, you know, but, but making good points, but also, you know, being like really bold about it. I heard you and, and uh, I think it was mark Marin talking about Kennison and boy, that really gave me a whole new, uh, Marin sm, amazing Kennis and stories. When he was on his podcast, he was talking about doing coke with Kennison and you know, how he was hearing voices for like a year. They did someone who was a young kid. Then when you're with him, you know, but she, can you imagine he did so much coke.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       He was hearing voices for a year. Whoa man. Holy break. Your Brain Batman. I was lucky I never cook. I was like, you've never tried it. I, I, I, the same woman that gave me Mtma for the first time. I gave me my first line of coke and I said, oh, this is awful man. It's like being a dentist's office. And she said, Oh yeah, it's always like that and beginning, but you know, after, after you know, 10, 12 times, she'll, you'll get to like it. And I said, you know, I went through that with Scotch and it's cheap and legal. I'm not going to go through that again. Yeah, there's weird things like caviar, it's an acquired taste. Why would you acquire it? Why would you acquire something that costs $10,000 in, tastes like shit. And if you don't like it to begin with, why acquire it?

Speaker 2:          00:10:30       Why acquire that? That seems really silly. Yeah. I never did the cocaine, but uh, I've had a bunch of people near me that had problems with it. I always associate cocaine with a lot of negative things that I'd seen, but one of the biggest ones was, uh, I was driving with some friends. We were in revere Massachusetts and there was this two lane road that we're leaving this area that was like a, there was this famous place. We'd go to Kelly's roast beef and everybody would go there and get clams. They had like fried clams there. It's like a famous spot. People travel from far and wide to go to Kelly's. So we were driving back from that and there's people behind us, people beside us in this car, we're doing coke and there was a girl in the backseat and they had the light that dome light on and she was doing coke and she looks over and sees us looking in there and she goes like this, fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:11:18       She's like, as they're driving by just looks at me like anger and craziness and that's how I view coke. Have you is like that lady. Look, I was looking at her. You're doing coke. You have the Dome light on and I'm looking at you and you're mad at me. I didn't do anything. No. I've had a few friends that got into it too far and it's. It's devastating. Yeah. So another thing that's another one of those things that your body connects to chemicals and become, it becomes a massive part of your life or some really strange reason. I've only done meth twice. Oh, that's a weird thing to say. And, and

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       the reason I would never do it again is because it's the one drug that could hit hook me is wow. The first time I did, I didn't even know what it was. I was a crewing for racing sailboats over New Orleans at Mardi gras regatta. And a guy that owned the boat was from Houston and I was in law school there and he wanted me to drive his boat back. Trail is on a trailer that dragon. And I said, oh, I can't go back. You know, I'm sleepy, I haven't slept in two days. And he says, here, take this. He gave me this and I drove straight through from New Orleans to Houston. I was wired, you know, and it was about a year later I said, hey, I want one more of those things. And he gave it to me and I thought, you know, I could get really hooked on this stuff, but I never drive her mess. What truck? Driver math? Yeah. That's the real math, right? I don't know, but I never came near it again after that. I've had some people got in real trouble with that to some friends. What is the comedown light? It's, it's crash. For me, it was just a total crash. I could, once I finally came down, I didn't go to class for a couple of days. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:12:54       when you were taking pure Mtma you had no crash at all?

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       I didn't not, you know, because nobody knew that you're supposed to. I think that uh, the other thing is I was working at the time, so maybe I was just so busy. I didn't notice it. But, uh, I'd never had to come down crash. When I was in Dallas,

Speaker 2:          00:13:10       I had a big one. I'll read it once. The next day I had to perform, I had to do a standup set and I went to a coffee shop in the morning and I was reading a magazine I couldn't read. I was like, I couldn't read. I couldn't, couldn't stay focused long enough to get through a sentence. I couldn't get through a paragraph. I couldn't do it. I just, I did have it in there. I was like, wow, I am stupid as fuck. I was like, what's going on with my brain? I didn't know about five htp. I didn't know about supplementing afterwards to try to re re re kickstart your brain's ability to produce serotonin and dopamine. But uh, it didn't, didn't sit me while I enjoyed the experience as far as like what I got out of it. But I also thought this would be very dangerous because that reality of the loving, warm ecstasy feeling when you're locked into it is very appealing. And you could want to do that a lot. And then if you wanted to do that a lot, you would experience that more or enjoy it more than you would enjoy regular reality. And then it would, you know, it's sort of like a point of diminishing returns,

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       build up a tolerance to it. Yeah. I, I did more Mtma then is sensible and because I didn't know what I was doing, see, that was the problem back then. Nobody knew anything about it in Dallas, you know, and we know it's safe, don't worry about it. And there was just no literature. There was no nothing. How did it get started? Uh, well, the, I don't know if the story ever really got out, but this guy, what he went by, the name Thomas Crown, he was the, uh, he was really the mainstay. Although, uh, uh, there's a guy that, uh, I'll think of his name in a minute. Everybody thought was the number one guy in Dallas, but he was a good friend of Tim leary and he's out here in La and Tim leary says here, try this. And that's when he found him. Oh, this is great.

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       I'm going to take it back. And He, he lit up Dallas with this stuff. So, uh, but, uh, I, I actually did a motivational speech and Mtma one time about two hours after I'd taken it, so I was still pretty much up there and they'd pay me to do a 30 minute keynote speech at this big corporate thing. I was an hour into it when they finally caught me off the stage, I had people on their feet is one of the best talks I ever gave. Why they, they cut you off, but it was only supposed to talk 30 minutes and after an hour they said, you know, that's really enough. Wow. That's A. Nobody was only one person in the room that knew I was an Mtma. It was one of the women there that uh, uh, actually she was one of my distributors. And what did she think?

Speaker 1:          00:15:33       She, she couldn't believe I was going to go on first of all. Wow. I did a lot of stupid stuff. Yeah. Well that sounds like nobody really knew what the hell was going on with that stuff. Chances. Human Guinea pigs. Yeah. And in that little interview I did, I told about the time that uh, well I took an way excessive dose. What does that mean? What's the way? Excessive 1500 milligrams. What's the, what's an average one? Hundred and 20 is what is that what you should take? You shouldn't, you should 120. So you took 10 times and I still have these two cassette to 90 minute cassette tapes that I filled up talking that whole time. I've never had the courage to listen to them again. But from that time, for another seven years, I'd tried Mtma about five years ago. Not long after nothing happened.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       Five years after. Nothing happened. About seven years after I finally got MDM aid work again, only did it once, a year after that. And I haven't done it now and I guess five, six, seven years. But, uh, it, it really fried my brain. Now, you know, Oprah put this bad news information out about the holes in the brain thing. And the night before, a couple days for that show aired, her producer was informed by maps that this is a totally bogus. It was alive. They put out there, there's no holes in the brain. It was a blood flow Mri or something like that. And I, you know, maybe I would be a genius today if I hadn't done that, but it, you know, it didn't really fry my brain now. It was so stupid. I had a monster headache for three or four days and a did not work again for a long, long time, but it didn't kill me and it didn't, I don't think put holes in my brain.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       The holes in the brain things, what everybody said. That was one of those, well Oprah, Oprah did that, you know, she had this Mri at this woman and the woman knew that it wasn't a hole in her brain maps. So I got ahold of it and they really gave her all the information. What this is, is about blood flow or something. Uh, but it was not a hole in her brain. And Oprah's producer knew that going in and she still let that hit the air. Sort of like the Ben Gazi thing only didn't get busted. That's so silly. Why? You know, why, why, why, but you know, I think they probably were trying to save people. They're probably trying to like scare people off doing and maybe in this day and age when you're dealing with something that's ultimately, you know, cut with a bunch of other shit. Now I went up, I would never take something that, that I got at a rave or a party or something like that that you just can't trust this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       And a lot of it's, you know, you don't know who's making it. And we at least had good sources, good supplies. We knew who the chemist was, stuff like that. But uh, today it's really not safe unless you're the chemist or friend of, um, unfortunately, you know, all, all could be fixed in a way you don't need to. You've got pot. Cannabis is really the miracle drug. It, you know, the plant does so much things for you. The hemp plant does that. Cannabis is really a medicinal plant. Certainly is. But for ptsd there's nothing like MDM, mdm a, but see that would be used with a doctor who knows his fly and stuff like that. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with dancing. I've danced all night on it too. It's really good, but there you. Oh, that's wonderful. How old were you when you were dancing?

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       All night on MDM and I was in my sixties. You were just learning? Yeah. I'm. I'm just catching up. You know, your kids got ahead of me. Everybody. They're ahead of us. Data you. They're ahead of me. The kids of today, are they? They're starting from the jump of the information. They just need to be cautious. Don't have to be crazy about these. It's just so unfortunate. When we have so many dangerous drugs that are labeled their prescription drugs, their, their, their, their dosages clearly marked. We know about them and yet there's these illegal ones that are just floating around out there and they're there in commerce or in connection. There's money. Money's being exchanged back and forth for taking him. There's no way you can ever regulate that unless you make it illegal. You can't. You can't. It is legal and then you get some kind of a structure to take care of it, but then again, the argument is logo that's going to be legal, going to make meth illegal to like start with cannabis.

Speaker 1:          00:19:36       Yeah. Yeah. And see what happens. You know that uh, Oh, you down for legal truck or math? Math was legal. Well, yeah, because you could regulate it. Yeah. But still you regulate it and say, you know, who needs it? Nobody. But still people would use it like crazy. They'd be way fucked up on it. They will go to the truck stop. You know, I really don't ever give much thought to those kinds of things because, you know, I'm not an activist and drug policy or stuff like that. And so, uh, uh, you know, mushrooms you can, you can grow at home now there's a new method to chrome and hydrogen peroxide so you don't have to worry about all this, you know, sanitation stuff and grow mushrooms and hydrogen peroxide as a bunch of youtube videos about it. Been out about two years now. Thirty five hours every second goes up there or something like that, at least. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       Yeah. That's just amazing. I'll tell you another thing, not to try. Not that it's not dangerous, but you know, when I first moved to Florida at a little after several years after I moved there and I lost all my connections and stuff. So the word on the street was that a nutmeg was very similar to MDM and a, and you could take some nutmeg. So I got one of those little mccormick tins of nutmeg and I, it all and I took me and not the big tin, but the, that me and putting them in capsules. Yeah. And I took the whole thing at one time. Oh my God, I got real sweaty, got a horrible headache. And today, uh, Christmas time I can't get near the Eggnog if it's got nutmeg on it because I'll throw up to this day. To this day, nutmeg will make me sick.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       But I have heard of people getting high from nutmeg. So what's that? That's what I heard too. But. Well, maybe you have to get the big tin, but the little tune a big tin of nutmeg and we'll just get you sick, but a big team will get you high. Well, I don't know. I would not try it myself because a little tin convinced me not to try it. Yeah. There was some guys in my message board that we're experimenting with getting high on that. I've heard that. I just don't believe it. Is that on the airway they have trip reports and getting high on nutmeg. Maybe they do. I don't know. I, I know earth and fire are friends of mine and it's a release or erowid.org. That's the first place to go if you're going to do a drug. Yeah. Arrow, widow and spend a lot more time there than you spend doing the drug.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       Yeah. Arrowhead. Nutmeg. What's. Find out if they have some horrible stories about, about, um, basketball sometimes. Yeah. When somebody asked me, well what's this like? Should I try this? I said, go to arrowhead and read the bad trip reports and if you can't handle a bad trip then don't go. But don't read the good trip reports. Anybody can handle a good trip. Yeah, there is. Apparently there's a page on Arrow would. It's all about nutmeg. If I love this. Arrowhead provides information about psychoactive drugs to educate, to reduce harms and to support and much needed policy change that, that, uh, some of their big customers or not customers or readers or dea agent, police agents, they have a whole separate section for law enforcement and for parents and see they started out as just a little database for their friends and now it's one of the most visited websites on the, on the net.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       It's a huge. So what did the ages go there for? Education is to find out more about, you know, the, the new drug will hit the streets and that's one of the first places they'll go to find out what it's about. That's interesting. I wonder if that's how they found out about bath salts. I Dunno, you know, they'd find out about it on the street, but to find out trip reports, what do you know? How do we know what these kids are on? What's it doing to them? And what do we do to, we take them to hospital or put them in jail and yeah, there's gonna come a day when people look back at this day and age and go, God, they were so nutty, like they just made it. Well we're just going to add oxygen to it in front of them, sell it. You know, we take this and this is illegal to get you 38 years, 30 years in jail for one ounce.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       This however is exactly the same effects plus this other weird thing that it does. And you can just buy it as bad as they're gonna go, wait, why didn't they fix that? Why did they let that go on for years and years and years, right? You know, it's crazy. People and poly drugging is a real problem with holly. Dragging a bunch of things together. Candy flipping, you know, some of them are, are safer than others, but a lot of the poly drugging is going on with the prescription drugs now. That's really fucking well prescription drugs just with the alcohol. That's a scary one. In the original hearing for cannabis, when they're going to make it illegal in 37, the only medical testimony was from the Ama and that was in favor of cannabis and they cut the guy off and throw them out of the hearing. The only medical, a testimony in scheduling it or that taxing it at the time was in favor.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Yeah, we're in some weird time still. It's amazing. It's amazing that 1937 work, you know, in 1930, whatever it was, and they made cannabis legal was a 37 to this day. It still affected me a massive amount of couple of generations. You know, they just had to just get grandpa and grandma just get them and then they'll get to tell their kids and they're going to tell their kids and everyone's going to be scared. Well now there's a huge movement in geriatric and geriatrics. Geriatric medical marijuana real. And I know some one geriatric doctor who is prescribing it for his patients. I, I've, I've know some anecdotal evidence of, of older people in nursing homes and all that have had some marvelous things happen to them. So it's finally getting into a GRANDPA and grandma do. Wow. That's amazing. It's amazing. After all these years, people are finally starting to catch on.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       Yeah. I've turned on people in their sixties that were very anti anti-drug, but they are all of a sudden all this pain or they're, they're going through cancer treatments or something there, you know, they can't keep their food down. And I said, hey, try this Brownie. You know, and pretty soon they're going to the dispensary regularly, you know, especially if you lived your life without it and you thought this is all it's available now all of a sudden you have this new cabi your own. You can't move around much. Hey, you know, there's something I can do here. Reduces inflammation to a lot of people that have serious problems with walking around. They take some pot and it just makes you all loosey Goosey as a lot of folks that have experienced that pain relief from. Especially if it's high in CBDS. Right. I, I use it for pain relief.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       And actually, I, I, uh, when I'm in pain, I can't tell it I'm high when I smoke it, but the pain doesn't, I don't think it goes away except you just don't pay attention to it. I don't know what the mechanism is about Ufo shows. Have you ever had any experience that, uh, when you were, um, on any sort of a psychedelic that you felt was like some sort of a paranormal experience, like a Ufo experience or like being in contact with something or seeing something that you, uh, you experienced where it felt like it was a real thing? Yeah, yeah, several times. Uh, mainly on Iowasca. But, uh, there was, there was one time that you still is just crystal clear to me where there was this. We're sitting in darkness, you know, and it appeared like there was a black curtain in front of me was just a really bright light coming out from the bottom and from back behind me, this, this female kind of entity, I, it was just very dark and shadowy.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       I said, what is that? And this, you know, this could be going on in my head. I, I admit that, but to me it was real and this entity, she said, well, that's what you are really made of. That's your core, do you want to see it? And she reaches down and start to pull this up. And it started getting so bright. I said, no, no, no, I got scared. I don't know why. And uh, some of my friends said, I can't believe you didn't let her pick it up, you know, but it was, it was like a message, like you are this bright, shining spirit behind this thing. To me that was a real entity and counter of some kind. So you think that that was like an inter dimensional thing that you were communicating with or could have been or could have been a figment of my imagination. You know, I, I, I've not tried to distinguish between it because the emotional impact of what went on and what I was thinking and saying and frayed to look at my own core was kind of fascinating, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:27:40       Well, it's also what is the source of the imagination and why is the imagination so obviously affected by different chemicals. And where's the imagination come from? Exactly what the imagination is clearly affected by cannabis, clearly also affected by caffeine, clearly also affected by alcohol, definitely affected by Psilocybin, definitely affected by many, many, many other things. Airplane Glue will do it. You have ideas that are different than the ideas that you have if you're in a baseline sober consciousness, and the real question then becomes what exactly is imagination? Is Imagination just a series of chemicals interacting with neurons, interacting with thoughts and ideas and learned experiences. Because out of the imagination comes everything that everyone ever used on earth. The thing that wasn't here already, anything we made, whether it's a phone or a television set or a curtain that all came out of the imagination.

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       So the imagination isn't just something where you think things up and they. Well, you know, maybe I just imagined it. Nothing happens without imagination. Exactly. The imagination is the source of every single creation. It's a weird thing when you look at it that way. Well you don't look at it as something like, Oh, you're just imagining things that aren't really there. Right? Well, you're also imagining the wheel. You're also imagining Internet connections. You're also imagining airplanes. Yeah. Somebody had to imagine all of those, all of that. Without that, there's nothing. Without the human imagination, the world would look radically different. It would be 100 percent natural and we'd be animals. The imagination is the one step that takes us from animal into animal that changes its environment radically and starts to transcend itself, starts to symbiotically attach itself to its own creations, which coincidentally came out of the imagination. The imagination created technology that like the glasses you're wearing or the watch I'm wearing or any, any of the things we're talking through these microphones. All of that is technology created through the imagination, right? Shoes or tech, you know, so when you see something and you say, well, maybe it was my imagination.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       I'm not exactly sure what that means. See, I don't really care whether it's my imagination or some other multidimensional entity. What I focus on, what am I learning? What am I feeling? First of all, what's my emotional state and then what am I going to take away from this? What am I going to learn? And, uh, recently, uh, podcast, I put out Mckenna says something to the effect of what makes us think that, that the entire cosmos can be understood using the neural network of a primate. He says, we're here to observe and appreciate. And I like that, you know, rather than try to figure out black or a dark matter and all that, that's great. I'm glad people are working on it, but I'm not gonna worry about it too much. I'm, I'm going gonna appreciate. And, and, uh, you know, look at the wonder of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       Just look at nature. It's just amazing. Mengele known just looked at all the different varieties of insects. They're just freaky, weird, alien creatures that we just take for granted because they've always been here. Well, spiders, we couldn't live without spiders, you know, or bees or bees. And that's getting to be a problem. It certainly is. And there's a lot of theories about that. But one of the more fascinating ones to me is that they are absolutely convinced that whether or not they can survive it or not, cell phone signals are damaging. B's got to be. It's, it's fucking with the way they end people powered lines and cell phone towers. You don't want to live near any of those. Yeah. Well I think that a high power lines has there been a direct correlation ever established between them and sicknesses between some high powered lines, not the real super high frequency power lines you had.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       There had been in effect, uh, I know somebody who died of cancer quite young who lived under those for a long time. And now that was anecdotal, but I think there has been, there have been some studies now showing because people in certain neighborhoods have sued and things like that. I've been around him before where you feel them. Yeah. And can feel that weird fee here. You're sanding necks and you kind of feel a buzz around you. We just realized like, this is enough energy to kill everyone you've ever met ever instantly. And it's just shooting through these wire lines. Well, we don't know what we're doing to ourselves with all these electronic signals. You know, you can't get away from it when there's Wifi everywhere now. There's no cell phones. There's TV, there's radio. Think of the information that's just in this room that we can't see.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       But with the right equipment we can tune into. Well, that's where it's going to be really weird when that equipment is actually inside your brain itself. Yeah. That's going to be very, very, very, very strange. It's getting there to us. So close. You know, they gave the person that first ticket for wearing google glass. I saw, I saw that, you know, and I think that was a valid issue of a ticket to. I don't want people driving and looking at Google at the same time or I don't like people talking on their cell phone unless they have hands free. My question is how can they prove that it's active? Because if you just have that thing on your eyes, you can't. I, I think the beat that ticket. But

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       uh, I think it sends a message. Yeah. The cops don't like technology. Well, they liked the technology they have. It's also the other messages. They like writing tickets. Oh yeah. They want to write as many as they can and they have to fill quotas. Feeling quote as one of the most disgusting things anybody ever got away with the idea that there has to be a certain amount of crimes that are committed in a month. Like what if everybody agreed to only go the speed limit for like a year. What would happen with the police officers just explode? I mean, what would they do if we all agreed that that would be an interesting project and some small town. If you could get everybody to do it, then nobody has any money that's coming in from. From speeding tickets. What do they do? Because they rely on it, you know, they rely on it for a source of income.

Speaker 2:          00:33:25       It's those couple of little towns on the way to burning man. That's, that's most of their income is insane. I mean, look, it's one thing if you want to tickets someone because you want to give them an incentive to slow down, to make people safer. That's one thing, but as soon as you start developing like you have a standard amount of money you have to make every month from you just saying that people never improve, you're just saying that people will never get better at following the law, never get better at being safer and just the fact that you bank on that you have a quota that's disgusting, but they were known speed traps and in Texas you know that you wouldn't go through this town because it was 15 miles an hour and 16 and get you a ticket. Connecticut's horrible. As Connecticut. Between Connecticut and Boston, there's a lot of stretches where it's 55 fucking miles an hour and 56 and there is nothing there.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       It's just straight line and you just want a gun it, you want to get the New York between New York and Boston's like three and a half hours at 55 miles an hour. We're just going cheese a scrape right everywhere you looked. Some asshole disguises a tree pointing a radar Acha so stupid. And now Jamie put up a picture just a moment ago, but now in, uh, in Colorado, they're developing this new technology to tell if someone's smoking pot and not look at these things, tell if someone's smoking pot enough inside of a building for it, the smell to leak outside. So they've developed this instrument that measures the amount of cannabis smell in the air on the street and they're going to start to give people tickets for these things, you know, that'll help vaporizer sales. Well this is in Colorado pot legal, this is so fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:35:00       Those are the 40 percent that didn't vote for it. It may be that or it may just be the fact that people are just floating out of control and just weeds blowing everywhere. Like, you know, like tumbleweed. I like the smell of weed just wafting through entire communities and people are catching contact ties and they've had enough. But you're not used to be. You'd put your pot in coffee and the dogs couldn't smell it for now they've trained the dogs to look for the coffee as well. I don't know if this is true, but a friend of mine told me that, oh, what he's been doing is buying a bear pis and wolf pis and sprinkling it around his tire tires and in his trunk because he says when the drug dog smells it and they go crazy, they forget about drugs. Totally. And they want to go attack, tackle bear, you know, I don't know if the cops do.

Speaker 2:          00:35:43       I don't. I don't know at this. Probably is made up, but it's a great story. You wouldn't think it would be made up. I mean, dogs instinctively freak out and they smell wolves. Yeah. And so a pete's coffee. Yeah. That seems to make sense. That's. Hmm. I wonder if they can get in trouble for like pasting wolf piss on your tires. How do they prove that they have a wolf piss knows. Then they put it on and bring in the wolf dog. They have a wolf piss detecting device just like they have a cannabis smell detecting device, but there's some, some sense that a dog can't resist that. You know the one cent that supposedly universally applies to all animals that brings in here brings an lps and Moose beavers piss. Really? Yeah. Beaver smell or beaver, beaver, estrogen, whatever it is. Beaver sent. I know a lot of young men to go after.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       Exactly. Which is interesting that term be because they don't look like, look, if you're a woman's vagina, looks like a beaver. Take her to a doctor. Something wrong. It's not supposed to look like that. So if you call into the beaver, why are you calling it a beaver? Because somebody else did before because it's. Well then the other idea is that it was created back when they were really hairy, mean we don't know about the Internet for porn before an Internet porn. Yeah. Yeah. Porn in the Internet. I think porn got women to trim it down a little bit and the imminent, the Internet came along and it was just, it was just fire through bushes, just the cube. But apparently the scent from the glands of Beavers is, uh, the best sexual attractant for other animals. Never go figure. Yeah. I don't know what that's about.

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       I mean, who thought that the beavers were the studs of the animal world? There's certainly a weird fucking animal, meaning if you see one in real life. Oh yeah. You know, and you see their crazy houses that they built next to the lakes were these giants in little lake in a canoe and paddle out there and there was a big beaver dam there. You could watch them. Then they were busy as beavers. Busy as beavers. Otters around there. And people eat them, delete them. Apparently they own tastes bad. I don't know. I guess when people are starving to death, you know, I watch a lot of those, uh, Alaska shows where people live in Alaska and eat whatever they can get ahold of them. A lot of people eat beaver up there. They eat beaver tails that cook the beavertail. That sounds like it'd be pretty tough.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       Cld eat a lot of seal. Marinade it. Yeah. Seal and beaver and you know, gotta what you got to eat, whatever the hell you can get ahold of up there. Probably. If you didn't know what it was, you'd say, Hey, this is kind of interesting. It can't be picky, they just need a source of calories and protein. Protein. Yeah, that's right there. Take it. You know, and apparently seal oil is very important for them because it's very high in calories and the cold you deal with apparently that's one of the best. The worst losses of caloric or of calories is your body burning off calories to keep itself warm. It's like one of the best they say to lose weight is to actually to walk around with like less jacket or less coats. Then you would feel comfortable with because your body in order to keep warm is actually burning off and on.

Speaker 2:          00:38:46       That's interesting. So are you going to go hunting in Alaska? No, I'm going in Wisconsin. I'm going, I said this weekend. Oh Wow. Yeah. I would go in Alaska too though. What are you going to after dear? Huh? Yeah. There's a guy who's got a farm. It's overrun with deer and he brings in people to hunt them, to manage them every year because the, you know, the reality is, as you said, especially in Wisconsin, a lot of them are going to die by predators. A lot of them are going to get hit by cars. A lot of them are going to freeze to death and you, in order to keep the herd healthy managed, you gotta you gotta finish and you've got to be the wolf and I want to. I want to try to live this entire year. I want to. I want to pick a time like after the first of the year and tried to live the entire year on game meat.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       I think it's possible. I think it's possible. I think if you're going to be a meat eater, you know, to know the exact source of your meat. I think it's probably the best, most ethical and sort of sane way to do it. The disconnect between us and our food, whether they're like, I love growing food in a garden and then cooking and eating the vegetables that you grow. I mean, I think it's a beautiful thing. It's, it's an interesting connection that you have between where your food actually comes from. I have chickens now and I get, I get fresh eggs from the chickens and I'm trying to get closer and closer to my food, if that makes any sense.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       Well, we mainly organic or almost all organic, but mainly vegetables. We eat chicken maybe twice a month and we have a friend that slaughters his, uh, his pig once a year and we know how it's grown and raised and everything. But uh, mainly vegetarians, but it, all our food, most of it comes within a 25 to 40 miles of our house, you know, that's. We belong to a CSA community supported agriculture and, and I do most of the cooking and so it's really fun. You get this box each week and then you got to figure out what you're going to do with stuff and that's really cool.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       That's a lot of fun. I would love that. I think I've talked to my friends about that with everyone. So God damn busy, we'd never get anything done. But the idea of getting together, everybody buying in on a plot of land and then hiring someone to run that plot of land and produce food for this group of people, like say get 20 people together and say, well this is our grocery bill for the year. If we can manage a plot of land and buy a plot of land together, everybody pay for one slash 20th of it or whatever, and then hire someone to take care of everything and hire a few people. I'd be some CSA is up here. There must be,

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       you know, there's several of them in San Diego County and we belonged to to this one for quite a few years now and they supply most of the local organic stores and so what we're getting are the tomatoes that are other heirloom, they're not perfect. They're in. We're getting food from a farm. Like it'd become a. not everything's the same size and shape and all like that. It's real. It's real food is picked that day or maybe the afternoon before and it's real good fresh food, but that way we don't have to get our group together. Now we're, we've gotten a bunch of people involved in this and some people don't like pomegranates, persimmons or whatever comes sometimes in the basket and so we swapped around with each other and stuff and uh, so we usually eat everything, so I get all the throwaways idea, had a bit of doomsday to it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       My idea was like if the shit hits the fan, you're in the survival stuff and you know, you read all that too. And when I was younger I was into that too. But now that I, you know, my dad, my brother and my mentor all died at 63, so I'm eight years past my expiration dates. So I feel like it's all free time. I exercise, I eat well, but you know, it's, it's, I'm not stressed about that. I see the Google kids are working on longevity, uh, things now. And, and I just commented a friend yesterday, I said, you ever noticed that all of this at longevity work is done by people in their thirties and forties, but, but I'm here seventies or eighties. You say, oh no, I don't really need that. I've had a lot of fun. I want to have a little bit more fun, but you know, if you gave me, you said here's a pill, give you another 100 years.

Speaker 1:          00:42:32       I'd have to think long and hard about that. Really? Yeah. Oh yeah. Because you would worry about deterioration or no, you're not having fun. Well, because, uh, there's a lot of pain and watching your friends go through what they're going to have to go through. Everybody's going to go through love affairs that are broken and tragedies and stuff like that. I just don't want to watch anymore that, you know, I, I, I love affairs. That's the big push over the edge. No, it's, I'm thinking of my grandkids now. Oh, they're getting their hearts broken and everything. We were talking about the radio lab thing earlier about the guy who went through this horrible circumcision process of becoming a runner. Wouldn't want a son to go through it. Yeah. You don't want your kids to grow through heartbreak. My children who've already gone through heartbreak now it's my grandkids and I pour it and I told one of my grandchildren.

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       I said, you know, if I'm not around when some young man breaks your heart, I will come back and haunt him. She remembers that the guys, why is it his fault? He doesn't want to be around her anymore. Well, see, I'm, I, I have four, five grandchildren, four girls. If it wasn't for that, I'd have a little problem with women, but I have a new sensitivity to women. Well, I have a very good sensitivity to women too and I have three daughters, but my point is that a lot of heartbreak comes from the fact that people just decide they don't want to be with you anymore and it doesn't work out right. And people think that when someone leaves them, that they're taking something away from them, they feel this deep sense of loss and they're connected to the idea. Part of growing as a person is realizing you're going to be okay and here's where mtma would be really cool if it was legal.

Speaker 1:          00:44:06       Because when you and your partner gets points say, you know, if it's bad for one person, it's going to be bad for both of them. Even if you're not talking about it, so if you sat down, got together one evening, just the two of you did Mtma and talked it out. Now I know from personal experience that, you know, my marriage with my previous marriage was really getting rocky when I found the MTMA and we stayed together another six, seven years. That good? Yeah. It really worked out good. Yeah. Because, because it died after that. Well, the kids were grown with. A lot of things happened after that, but. But it did extend our marriage and extended it and a really good way. Oh, that's great. And we were married 21 years and we're, we're good friends now who was a rocky period for awhile, but we've worked ourselves through that to where, you know, we both respect each other and we realized that it was not a one way street. But uh, you know, I think that Mbma would be great for couples therapy of people, uh, when they hit that seven year mark or whatever it is, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:45:03       Yeah. Well, I think there's a lot of things that people hold in depressing relationships and don't communicate about, and then sometimes the psychedelic journey together can open those ideas up and you start talking about things and you find out that there's been a misunderstanding all along or that it could a bit of lack of communication that you could have worked things out much better, much easier a long time ago or that you're both feeling the same way. They both want to move on, you just don't know how to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       And you know, I've had one experience where I went on for months, something was building up and finally got it out and she said, oh, that's no big deal and it's something that had been a big deal to me for a long time. And it turned out if I had just been talking about it, I would've had a month of bliss instead of hell. You know? So communication is the key and there are some things that help you communicate. Pot helps you communicate.

Speaker 2:          00:45:49       Yeah. Don't you think that those things and those heartaches and those, that's part of what makes you a person. It's information you have to get that information. It's feedback

Speaker 1:          00:45:57       now. I wouldn't want to not have any of my heartbreaks and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:46:01       I just don't want. I don't want to see it happen to somebody. I understand and I agree to a certain extent, but I think it's very important that everybody goes through a certain amount of it just to understand what it's about, but you don't have a choice. You're going to look. I've had friends that have gone through it where I know they. They became better people because of it. Yeah. A friend who went through a devastating breakup and now he laughs about the idea of being stuck with that woman. You know? Back then he thought there was no way you could live without her, and I was like, yeah, it doesn't. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       No matter what happens to you, how big the tragedy is that after some time passes, eventually that becomes one of your funniest stories.

Speaker 2:          00:46:37       Oh, I doubt it. Oh, no. Right. Some of these things that were did was eaten by a wolf on talk, now that I'm thinking about, fucking saw your family die in a plane crash. I'm thinking of things happened to me. Fucking crazy. If you think about some things that happened, seemed to be a tragedy at the time and usually between people carve brands just talking about like breakups. I'm talking about like getting fired. I'm talking about things that are not really devastated. Getting fired is a good thing. I've had that happen sometimes that that can turn into a good thing. It can be a changing experience and change I think oftentimes opens up the door for good. Yeah. You know, change opened up the door for good because it gives you a new found focus. You know, if you survive it, you're going to be stronger. Yeah. Every time I've like had something happened to me where I had to rethink things, that's always been a good thing. Oh yeah, and when you get fired, you all right, what are we doing here? And you all of a sudden you get this new motor.

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       I realized subjectively this would be a good thing for grandkids

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       when it happens to him. I just don't want to go through. That's part of being a GRANDPA. I mean, isn't that what they always say that the strictest parents were always like the most lenient grandparents? I wasn't a strict parenthood. Even more so than even more lenient, but yeah, the idea, especially when you're an older person and you've experienced so much pain and hardship and you see the innocence of children whose how beautiful it is, they don't know any racism yet. They don't know any homophobia yet. They don't know any blind objective hate. They don't know they. They don't know the disillusion of government. They don't know all this. Right? They don't know any of this yet. They don't know like they don't read the, the rebellion against taxing and it's like all the different aspects of society that, you know, bring people to this hysterical freakout point where you're like, this fucking thing is I'm mad as hell.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       I'm not going to take it anymore. I'm like, I love that. Yeah. They don't have that. They have, you know, you stepped on my toe, they have, that's my toy, you know, relatively speaking, these are big problems for them to all the little kid problems that we just have to learn how to work our way through. And my three year old has a way bigger problem with my five year old taking one of her toys than I have with anything in life. My five-year-old takes her toy and she, she screams tiers are flying out of her face. That never happens to me. So for her, that's a devastating apocalypse. A huge groups of toys. Yeah, it really is. It's relative, relatively speaking, and you have to address it that way. You have to sort of respect the fact that they actually are freaking out and although it doesn't seem normal to you, you are grown adults.

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       Right? But for a three year old this you've to that this is a real serious thing for them, you know? And so you got to treat them like adults. My parents didn't shut up, you know, that's how I grew up. Shut up. Shut your mouth. I'll break both your legs. That's the type of shit I heard. I was. I was really lucky. I grew up liking an ozzie and Harriet family. It was, it was my problem. Yeah. But I couldn't have asked for better parents and we were looking at it. Turned out ecstasy dealer. Dallas drug dealer sends him to college. He deals well hosting a drug podcast. Guys. Crazy. What is this book that you wrote? The spirit of the Internet. Uh, that's, that's, uh, I wrote that in 2000 actually. It's one of the first books that compares the Internet to a psychedelic drug speculations on the evolution of growth.

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       Global consciousness. Yeah. Wow. Look at you. You fresh faced little. Yeah. That's a long time ago. That's 2000 when you wrote this in 2000, 13 years ago. I. That was the last nonfiction I wrote. I've got a fiction book up now. That's a first of a quartet I'm writing. But uh, uh, I went to fiction because it's so much more fun. Do you remember sort of Graham Hancock? Did you, do you remember when people thought that the world was gonna end in 2000? Oh yeah. Y Two k, well that was a big deal, man. See I got involved in y two K in about 1995 because we, we've

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       set aside millions of dollars to fix all those problems and most of the software industry did. I mean there was a huge thing and the press only picked up on in the last nine months or something and we'd already spent millions of dollars and years and years of work. There's specialized companies working on it and so I really didn't think anything bad was gonna happen. I wouldn't want to be somewhere on an airplane right then because there were a few glitches. Well, I didn't know. I didn't think the airplane would crash. I thought I could get stranded somewhere and they couldn't get my reservations. Oh right. I wouldn't worry about the plane itself. That was a fear though. Like air traffic controllers that their, their computer systems, we're going to go down. There was a potential for that, but it was nothing like the press made. What the fuck did they do for air traffic controllers before there were computers, eyeball, I guess radio and I will look in the 19 sixties.

Speaker 1:          00:51:16       What? How did they describe by cow? I guess it was like a coming in at 30,000 feet. Twenty five degrees north. I got to talk them down. I don't know. I'm a commercial pilot. Vital I've got. Are you really? But it's restricted to hot air balloons, commercial commercial pilot and it says restricted to lighter than air aircraft. Lighter than air. And I, I don't have a balloon anymore, but I used to fly balloons. Yeah. Whoa, that's got to be spooky. Oh, they're great fun. Like you in a basket near space. It's just awesome because now it gets loud when you burn, but then when you're not burning you're just floating. It's quiet and you could hear the sound, you know, there's no obstruction. So you can hear people talking on the ground. And in Dallas there's this one track that we had taken Sunday morning because there was a woman who would lay out in her backyard but naked.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       Yeah. So we would come in, we'd burn. And then we'd, we'd come up high so that we coast down in low and come over the lake and just. And then we'd say good morning, she jumped in. How rude. Yeah, it was a, you could hear everything in Texas cars you'd fly or and Sunday morning and see pickup trucks with people passed out in the back of them and stuff. Wow. With yell at them. How dangerous is it though? It seems like it's pretty dangerous. The reason I quit is because I wasn't paying close enough attention. I almost hit a power line and it scared me so much. I was flying people for money and stuff, you know, at the time. Oh my God. I got wrapped up in the conversation these guys are having, that's my problem in paying attention to them more than the flying.

Speaker 1:          00:52:44       And they didn't know. We had a close call. I knew we had close calls. How close? Not that close. Close enough. I, I was coming down and I didn't burn soon enough. And so it takes a while to get your momentum backup and uh, you know, I cleared it by 50 feet. But you know, I should have cleared it by 500 feet or something. Like, no, I was coming in for a landing, I guess. Anyhow, it scared the hell out of me. And I said, you know, that's it. How many people had died hitting power lines? So that's mainly, it was just happened to people in balloons. Not, not, not all that many compared to the number of people flying, you know, it's safer than regular aircraft or you harnessed in when you're up there. Oh No. Oh Jesus. I used to sit on the edge of the basket, you know, and burn.

Speaker 1:          00:53:25       Really? Oh yeah. Fucking a man. What if a crazy rebel wind came along and knocked you off? Well, you wouldn't have launched. If it's over 10 miles an hour, you wouldn't launch. We have a lot of trouble for her. Look so spooky. We'd curling my toes. Just sitting there looking at that video. We'd go to these airshows where they bring in biplanes and stuff like that. And for the balloons, they would put up a pole in the middle of the airfield with the keys to a cadillac or something on it and you had to go five miles away, anywhere in the radius of five miles away and launch and whoever could grab the keys, got the balloon. Wow. What if they collide into each other? You kind of bounce off. But if you're at the same altitude at least, but you the rules the road so you're not supposed to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       But nobody in things I ever flew in ever got the keys. But you have a beanbag too, so you throw that in. Whoever got closest would win money or something like that. But wow, it's great fun. You know that my, my ex wife took me on a balloon ride for my 40th birthday. And on the way back I said, well, how much do these things cost? How did he get started in the next morning? I was taking lessons. I had a lot of money. Then. How much does it cost to get a balloon? A balloon is about $35,000. It wasn't back when I bought it. Yeah. And how do you fold that bitch up once you've done flying or they pack into a basket that's a. Oh maybe a third of the size of this table. Wow. And, but then you have your basket too. So you have a trailer behind your.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       Do you have a parachute up? There ain't shit hits the fan will know nothing. No dude, I had balls. I had one guy wanted to pay me to take them up in a parachute, but he wanted to jump out, but I didn't want to do it because once a, once a guy jumps out, you get so much lighter and if you're not careful, you shoot up too fast. You collapse the envelope. That doesn't happen very often, but they're really safe. Really safe. There are a lot of fun and wow, that sounds scary. That you lower yourself. Do you have to lower it? Naturally the. There's a hole in the top and you have a line that goes through it and a rope. Pull it and bleed air out of the top and let it go. And then when you're, when you're actually landing, the top is held in by Velcro and so except for the little flap that's open and when you're just very land, you rip that called pull the top out, you pull the top out and then it will deflate and land down.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       Sometimes your landings are a little rough. You know, I've had landings are dragged for 50 years. One hundred yards were bounced up and down. You know that the conditions sometimes make it tough. And in, in North Texas at the time you had to be really, you know, you can, you're allowed to land anywhere when you're landing, you know, the Faa let you because you, if you, if you out of fuel. And there was this one farm up in north Texas up by Cisco I think it was. And, and whenever the balloons would come and landing, you can see dust coming on these gravel roads from two directions. One would be this farmer with his pickup and his shotgun and the other, it'd be the sheriff to come to protect you because the farmer, hey, did you landing on their lawn when ballooning started? In France, they would carry a bottle of champagne to give to the farmer when they landed as, hey, thank you for letting us land here.

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       Here's the champagne. When ballooning started in the United States, the balloon has never gave it to the landowners. They drank it themselves, you know, champagne and propane. Breakfast. The balloon is how rude. That's why they ruined the whole thing. Look at this. That looks like Albuquerque. Yeah. There's one in Colorado too, and Colorado Springs. We went to. The woman that taught me the balloon, moved to Colorado Springs to. Yeah, we went there to see it, but there was bad weather so they'd never launched it. So you got to do it, you know, at sunrise and sunset the a couple of hours until after sunrise and a couple hours for sunset. That's the only time that the air is stable enough. Have you ever met anybody that was up in a balloon and saw a Ufo? No. No. I mean it's too early in the day or plus you're looking at other things.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       How convenient. But what most people like to do on their first balloon ride is picked leaves from the top of a tree. Wow. For some reason that's a big thrill, you know. So we'd go and skim the trees and they can pick leaves. Wow. That's Weird Grief Fund. It's weird that we figured out how to float float around in the sky. Yeah. You know, it's just a matter of time before we figured out how to do it with suits. Some jet packs are coming around pretty good and well they've got guys that have those wings suits that jump off cliffs. Psychopaths some nuts. Oh, I can hardly watched those videos for me to watch. And there's one word, guy crashes. It's really hard to watch that one I haven't seen, but it's just a matter of time before they figure out something with like a wing wings on that technology is going to grow.

Speaker 1:          00:57:50       I think everything's going to grow, you know? I mean if they have a jet pack now and they. Do, you know, I watched one when I was in Denver. There was my friend willy has a Klg. What is it? Kale, PJ Klp, j, the radio station had a guy come in that's a, a, a that had a jet pack guy come in and he launched a jet pack in the parking lot and flew through the air for like 10 seconds. You can only do it for like 10 seconds and it was like within x amount of years are going to be able to do five minutes and then, you know, x amount of years after that they think they're going to figure out some sort of power source that's going to be able to make it a viable mode of transportation. But it was very complicated as far as like the controlling the yard and what is it called?

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       There's like to pitch, pitch and Yaw. Yeah. Apparently it's like it's not a simple thing to figure out how to do. We didn't have to learn that to get a license for balloons because you know, just up and down and he had literally have to learn whether cloud's a. You had learned about procedures with the FAA because you have to call the FAA in the morning, get a weather report and all. And you tell them where you're going to launch and so they'd know some balloons are going to be in the area. How much different is that than a blimp? Can you, can you target a blimp? I've never been in a blimp. But pilot one with your license. Oh No, no. It's lighter than air. Well maybe. I don't know anybody crazy enough to let me do it. But I guess I guess that would be legal. It's lighter than aircraft. Yeah. Do you have to renew that license or is that once you get it, you got it. That's the crazy thing. You, you don't ever have to renew it, but you have to have a check flight every year I think with somebody else who's a commercial pilot.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       So all you have to do is get a friend, go out and take a ride with you in your current. Again, I'm not current. What was that? When you just put up Jamie got an address that flies and lady Gaga the actual lady Gaga, like remote controlled. And uh oh. So is it lady Gaga or is it a toy? That's lady Gaga. Lady Gaga is in a jet pack. Okay, here she is. She's got a helmet on. Let me see this. Well, this is. We just want us after it's over. So she climbs into this fucking thing and flies around.

Speaker 2:          00:59:56       I didn't think jetpacks could be annoying. Book is Lady Gaga and Jetpack Yeomans. We ruin everything. This is so stupid. She's connected by wires. Shut this off. This is a fucking charade. Sunday really? A jetpack. She's all wired up and everything like that. It's more like a little helicopter. Yeah, that's horse shit. That's what that is. It's wired. But you know there have been guys go into the stadium football stadiums and those jet packs. Yeah. Well there's that one guy that landed, he was in the middle of a boxing match. Evander Holyfield was fighting Riddick bowe and the guy landed. He had like a parachute connected to fans and he called himself like the fan. I remember that. And they landed in delayed the fight for like a half an hour while they had to arrest this guy bringing police and they beat the guy up and everything like that. And then it sort of changed the, uh, the atmosphere of the fight because there was a big break and blow the fight.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       Anybody cool off and then had to go at it again. But that was, I saw on, I used to walk on the bluffs down by del Mar, which are maybe 30 feet or something. And one day a guy came by and one of those, he's a parachute, had a big fan on the back and, and he was at eye level with me and he said, hello, hello. And he's moving very slowly. Yeah. This is the video riddick bowe and evander holyfield fight and look, they stop and they're like, what the hell? And they're looking at is boom. The guy lands ringside in the crowd. They should've turned hola holyfield onto them. Let them while they were in the middle of, he has other more important things to do. They just beat the shit out of this guy though. I can see why you think that guys probably still in jail or I'm surprised they didn't just reschedule the fight.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       That's not really fair to do that as well. I think people wanted to conclusion yeah, it was all going on and all the money there in all the money on paper view as well. Poor fighters. So yeah. You know what, they should have just started it up immediately. Shouldn't have waited a half an hour to give it a little five minute break, cut the cords, just, let's do this. But as I think it was a quite a, quite a break while they arrested this dummy, she needed pitch. That's it. That's an example of a needy bitch. So they should have those fights indoors. Yeah, I think they probably mostly do. I very rarely hear about fights out. Do I know they do a few occasionally outside and Vegas is a big one, uh, way back in Africa or something. I can't remember. The two Moitai ones they do do more time. Ones in Vegas outside.

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       Well didn't get quite

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       as loud I think. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       But it's also your, you're, the environment is different. You're dealing with outside rain and weird. You know, I went to a, um, a king of the cage. Used to have these fights outside. I went to a couple of them, they used to have them in an Indian casino in California back when mixed martial arts was illegal in California, so they would hold them in this outside casino and one time they uh, it started raining, it was pouring rain out and instead they decided to let the fights continue in the pouring rain. So these people are fighting, they're slipping, they try to throw kicks that fallen on their ass and people are climbing on top of that. They're soaking wet. It was the craziest and they released it as a DVD, I think it's called King of the cage, wet and wild, but it's a really insane series of fights where people were trying to fight in a torrential

Speaker 1:          01:03:06       rainstorm. People just, just so nutty. Did you ever hear of an old long time ago wrestler name Gorgeous George? Yes, sure. I saw a gorgeous George Wrestle. My Dad took me to see them in the Elgin Highschool Gymnasium and the big deal, he had long hair. Well, it was maybe almost down to his shoulders, but not quite, but at that time I was huge in his. When he come out in the ring, in the beginning, he, his hair would be up and he'd take bobby pins out of his hair and throw them out to the audience. I was so disappointed. I didn't catch you on. That's so funny. Gorgeous. George's George, what's another thing that people would come if they came here from another planet? The biggest. What the fuck is going on?

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       Those guys are really hitting each other like, why are you watching? That was fun. We had to find out who's gonna win, who's the champion of the world

Speaker 1:          01:03:55       this week. Yeah. We were strange for strange floating around and balloons pretending to hit each other. Not Erase. Listen, man. It's been a lot of fun. It's been great. Fun is enough. Really glad to get to meet you. I don't think you realize what you're doing, but you are. You're filling in a role here for a lot of young people that you know. You don't know how smart you are. Maybe you do, but you're. You're extremely well read. You know so much your time at Graham Hancock about stuff. I read the headlines and you know, all these terms about the skull and stuff like that, but what you're doing is you're taking a really, uh, a high level intellectual product to the masses into especially young people that maybe hadn't had the advantage. You go to college or something and they find out, hey, they're as smart as anybody that went to college and you're really doing a really good service with these products.

Speaker 2:          01:04:46       Well thank you. But I'm not trying and I'm working. That's why it's working. I'm extremely uneducated. You're very well read. Well, I read a lot of things but you know, I mean what is education? They are not reading but as far as like formal education and it is also as far as like, I don't know, I just liked what I like. I'm interested in certain things and I find that there's a lot of things out there that are fascinating that people just aren't paying attention to. And I think what would I see in what we talk about on the podcast is really reflected by what I see on and when I see on the Internet, when I see, when I go to the various websites that I visit for information, I see just a massive new upsurge and curiosity. I think the people were way more curious than they ever have been before, just by virtue of the fact they're getting more information than they've ever done.

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       They can get it, you know, they're not being held back. So I think what this podcast is, we came along in the right place at the right time and it was the right type of person in me that kind of can bridge a few different worlds. Exactly that, that's what you're bridging quite a few different worlds. And that's really important in the potheads exactly. When the bridge between the meat heads and the beds were not all that different, you know, we might look different, but there's, there's prejudice against people who engage in martial arts and exercise just like this prejudice against people smoke pot. And some of it's justified. And some of it's not.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Yeah, there's assholes in every. Absolutely. It's so easy to define people because of that, you know, and I think that, uh, in conversations like this and podcasts and it kind of gives everybody a better sense. We're getting into people's heads because you're writing their ears, you know, they got the earphones on, they're listening is theater of the mind, you know, and uh, it's, it's, uh, the old voice in the back of the mind that you hear that, you know, I've heard so many of your podcasts that, you know, I feel like I've known you all my life.

Speaker 2:          01:06:33       I feel I've known you a long time to. I've listened to you on many road trips, give the introductions to all these different various psychedelic talks. How many episodes do you have?

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       Uh, I just last night did three 78. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:06:45       You are on episode four. Nineteen. You almost ran for 20. We were going to do a special for 20 episode, but now I'm like, what? That's so stupid. I'm so tired of that hole. For 20 thing. It's just like, what? This is a number, the podcasts or the pot, I mean we, and I'm kind of hypocritical because we always like make a big deal of it each 100 that we hit, but for 20 to seem stupid it seems like a tired thing for Tony. Like come on,

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       I'm thinking about for 400 what I've been working on it. It's not too far along yet, but I've, I've cut out little sound of Mckenna, you know, 30 to 62nd soundbites and I have about 100 of them from a 100 different talks he gave and I'm going to try to spring string them together and cut up and try to make it a single cohesive type thing. Hasn't been working too well yet, but uh, it's worth a try and he has one of the cool things that you do do that's kind of scary and dangerous and sacrilegious.

Speaker 2:          01:07:41       You Edit Mckenna speeches. Get a lot of grief. A fucking freak. And why'd you cut out the stuff about the stoned ape theory? Well, because it's the 80th time. You heard it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:49       You know, I'm not a historian. My job is to get the carnival barker and all of the masters copies are going to Arrow, would have all the masters and then the real master tapes and all are going to go back to offend Mckenna. Beautiful. So that's awesome. Yeah, they're out there now. They're out there. You can get a hold of them. Now. I've got about another hundred Mckenna talks. Nobody's heard yet. Including me. Hundred. Yeah. Oh my God. Wow. So I'm. I'm good for another year or so. And plus we were doing the plank and rj talks at burning man that gets. We had another 30 or 40 every year. Wow. You change your name because of burning man. Yeah. Well that's when you know you get too high when you change it. My friend rob did that. He used to be. Chris became. I've been working up to it and, and my, my sister in law who died had called me Lorenzo all the time. So it was a family name and, and at burning man, this damn parrot crime's up on my arm. And I said, what's that Paris name? He says, Lorenzo. And I said, oh, that's my name too. And that was the day I changed it. Wow, that's hilarious. That's really hard for my wife and family. But they finally got there.

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       Oh, so the twitter is psychedelic Lozo l o z o. So a follow on twitter and the podcast is the psychedelic salon is available for free. It's on itunes. And can people donate if they want to? Yeah, that's how it's kept alive. I can't afford it. They just, you know, I've got a a donate button on the psychedelic salon that us has a donate button. I'm putting us.us.us yet calm net org or us and it all goes to the same place and then I'm going to put a bitcoin thing up there too. Beautiful. And they can go to Lorenzo haggerty.com and it has links to a little 15 minute video of my life. And then the, the MDM story in Dallas era and all the. All the links are Lorenzo haggerty.com outstanding. And the book, the spirit of the Internet is back when he was Lawrence Lawrence. I'm looking for, Lorenzo is the spirit of the Internet by Lawrence Haggerty.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       Genesis generation is my novel. It's just out. Beautiful all on on kindle. Thank you sir. I appreciate it. It's been an honor to be an artist for me as well. It's really cool and I think both of our audiences to cross a lot and so I'm glad they both got to hear it. Absolutely, and I, like I said, I think that's how I heard about you in the first place. I'm pretty sure. So I've got a lot of people in my audience say the first time they heard about me was from you, so it goes around, comes around, and indeed it does. Thank you sir. You're welcome.
