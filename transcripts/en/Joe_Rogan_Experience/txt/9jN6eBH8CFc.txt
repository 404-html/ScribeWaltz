Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Three. Two we need like a digital counter. Three, two,

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       one. Whew. If you're going to drink that, Andrew, be very careful. It's 270 milligrams of caffeine. That Ooh,

Speaker 3:          00:00:17       right. That'd be donated. That allowed. You can have that.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       Brendan drank one of those yesterday and a pot of coffee and have a cup of coffee and then on top of that he drank a, what'd he have? Something? A venti with a shot of espresso in it from starbucks with all cha all doing it while he was fasting. So a halfway into the podcast, he starts hurling, runs into the bathroom, throws up, then it comes back and then throws up in a bucket at the end of the podcast. Literally didn't, didn't make it out of the room

Speaker 3:          00:00:47       so they could have had a heated seat if you had to take a shit. Yeah, we have a heat instead of 200 7,270 milligrams. Yeah. Caveman coffee. Nitrogenated it's basically like espresso with nitrogen in it. It's good stuff. You get used to it. Good. I'll take it before bed. Yeah, that's a good move. You'll have some weird dreams. All right. Take Express will before I go to bed. Andrew, I'm not used to this clean shaven, Andrew. Yeah, like a different human. You could sneak up on people. That's the point, man. My daughter's about, oh, about a year ago, said they had enough of the beard so it had to go.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       Oh, when I was a, well when my daughter was one, a friend of mine died and we on the Internet, we'd all had this guy, Evan Tanner, who is a former UFC champion. And we had decided that we were all gonna grow beards for him cause he had this crazy giant beard. And so a bunch of us on the Internet did it. And I just grew this fucking werewolf beard. And then it got to a point where I was like, you know, it was time was up. I was going to shave it off. And my daughter had no idea what I really looked like. So I shaved my face and she started screaming. She thought it was somebody else and she started crying and I'm like, touch it. This is, this is my normal face. And then she's confused. She's like, I know that voice. Like who are you there? That's what it looks like.

Speaker 3:          00:02:02       Oh Nice. That's a sand a half with my boys. They were, they were young too, like so they had never seen me without it. So like they thought you were a stranger to then you see that that's because we're on TV. I trimmed the cheek areas cause it creep up. Gq. Gq Did. Yeah. I'm trying to look fresh. Well I have to admit the fact that after 30 years of not having a beard meeting you right, I ended up with that beard and then started speaking Arabic. Right out of nowhere. Out of nowhere. How weird. It was more academic to go when you're lecturing on the lecture circuit sometimes for, but for

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       guy with your experience, like that kind of beard is a, it's normal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean guys who have lived your line of work,

Speaker 3:          00:02:50       I don't know man. It's like counter culture, so anti establishment establishment. So that's part of it. You know. And like anything else you get into, I don't know. It felt normal. Right. So it was like a, probably a crutch a little bit and uh, something that felt right for a long time. I don't think it's a crutch,

Speaker 2:          00:03:07       but I think it's definitely like a mark of the, the occupation. I remember a red tick mark Kinko's book. Shanko Marchenko I read one of his books way, way back in the day. Rogue Warrior. Yeah. And they were talking about guys who had dress, they just how they didn't fit in with like regular military.

Speaker 3:          00:03:28       Yeah, no, totally, totally like, uh, unconventional. Probably a better way to say it. You know what I mean? So not in with authority, not in with, you know, uh, everybody being the same way, not down with uniforms, not down with, you know, using name and rank, you know, we called everybody by their first name, grew our hair long, grew beards wrong. It was just kind of, uh, uh, you had to earn that. Right. You know what I mean? So that's part of it. Like, Hey, I earned the right to be able to be autonomous, so, so to speak. And so that's kind of the, uh, some of it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       It is interesting. You know that that's the, the, the, I mean, I don't want to make distinctions, but the baddest motherfuckers in the military are the ones who dress like, like just regular savages. It's something, there's something odd about that. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       I Dunno man. There's just a, like that idea though, that you have to earn it. Yeah. Yeah. You got to earn it. And you know, it's like you get so tired of doing what you're told and you want to do what you think you need to do for the job. You know what I mean? So like what, what is it, how, how do I see that I need to accomplish this task, whatever it is. And I don't need to be dictated from somebody who's not going to be there telling me how to do it. And so that goes all the way down to even like, okay, well what kind of boots am I going to wear? What Kinda, what Kinda uniform do I need to accomplish this mission or do these things? And I just kind of, that's the way those guys are. They're always thinking about, you know, not, not how to, not how to, not how to fall in line man, but like how can we think differently to solve problems and, uh, you know, the uniform is just one of those things.

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       This is very interesting now, um, for just, so this is a standalone podcast so people don't have to go back and listen to the first one that we did. We have Dr. Mark Gordon here, a good friend of mine and, um, Andrew Marr who is the founder of the warrior angel.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       Yeah. Me and my cofounder. Me and my brother Adam Mar, who was also in the army

Speaker 2:          00:05:23       and we did a podcast a while back, but for the people that didn't hear, explain what the Warrior Angels Foundation is and what you guys do.

Speaker 3:          00:05:30       Yeah. Can I get some context first, Joe? So we talked about I was special forces green baret for a better part of a decade, you know, so I would say somebody defined by my vision of the future. Uh, and so that always led me to doing what I wanted to do in life. And so, you know, special forces, Spec ops type dudes, they're in life and death situations pretty regularly and, uh, perform, uh, otherwise they don't live. You know what I mean? And so that was kind of life for the better part of 10 years being in life and death situations on a regular basis. And so going from that, you know, uh, I would say a high performer, uh, by, you know, by every metric to one day after my last deployment, uh, I woke up and I was on 13 different medications. You know, I couldn't remember how to drive home from the same route that I've been driving home every day.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       Uh, I was just in chronic pain all the time. I had these balance issues where I couldn't walk in a straight line, uh, blurry vision would go into double vision and I had these horrible migraine headaches. So just the ability to bring that way and then, uh, started to have become depressed. And this was like, uh, this was just mind boggling to me because I was living, I thought my life's purpose, right? Doing the job I wanted to do with the people I wanted to be with Mary, to the woman of my dreams, had the family that we always wanted. But yet here I am, I have all these physical problems. Now I'm starting to be depressed and I don't have a reason to be depressed. And then I started having panic attacks in public, in our weight room at home, in front of my kids, you know, like just breaking down crying and not knowing why and not being able to do anything about it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:15       And, uh, and then I started to have, you know, and that was again, like my, the structure of reality. It was fracturing around me. And, uh, I, I, I didn't know why or what was going on, you know, and the first thing he can think to do and something like that was to drink. I was like, I gotta I gotta stop this and I don't, I don't know what to do. Uh, I think I have some screws loose or what's going on, but all I know is this is so disastrous. Maybe if I just drank, I can, I can put the, put the brakes on this a little bit and uh, and, and things just continued to get worse and then my behavior just continue to skyrocket out of control. And it wasn't like I was making conscious decisions to be fucked up. Uh, like I'm driving, I'm drinking and driving on a regular basis and I never even crossed my mind.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Like, that was a wrong thing to do. It was just like, hey man, I can't function unless I drink and I got to drive. So that's what we're going to do, you know? And then, uh, start producing just horrible effects on my family with that line of behavior. And it got to the point and, and as a special forces operator, man, all you want to do is operate. All you want to do is be on the team and go and do the things that we signed up to do. It didn't have any problem with that or it wasn't like, Oh, you know, all these combat scenarios are weighing on me and it's been too much and, and I just can't handle it. Like, that's the only thing I felt comfortable doing and wanted to get back to it. And, uh, but again, like I'd never had any of these symptoms before.

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       So life is just spiraling out of control and not sleeping and everything else. And so finally, you know, you sit on it until you can't sit on any longer. And it got to the point where I was like, I'm not only am I a detriment to myself and probably society, like I can't go out and operate right now, like these guys can depend on me. And so at that point I was like, I gotta raise my hand and I got to get some help. And, um, you know, that well intended people, eh, wanted to offer as much help and find the answers as they possibly could. But again, all that got me was 13 different medications and, uh, it was told, hey, you've had so many head injuries, you can't afford to take another blow to the head. And this is probably going to be the new you.

Speaker 3:          00:09:28       You're going to be on these medications, take a pen and a pad everywhere you go. And, um, and learn how to live within these new parameters and schedule out your meds and this is, this is going to be that. And so it was a medical retirement. It got so bad, Joe, that my wife was nine months pregnant with our fifth child and she had to ask me, Hey Andrew, can you keep your drinking down today in case I go into labor so I don't have to drive myself to the hospital, you know, so that's all bad it was getting. And that wasn't enough to stop me. And so she actually, our son had a, uh, uh, genetic, uh, lymphatic malformation, his neck, and he got sick. He's like 13 months old and it got infected and it blew up to like the size of a softball.

Speaker 3:          00:10:10       And this is when she's nine months pregnant. So we have to take him to the emergency room. And my calf had been killing me for about three days at this point. Uh, I didn't think anything of it. I just wrote it off. But we're in there in the emergency room, like he's having trouble breathing. It's, it's bad like a softball. And his neck. Well, he turns out he has to go into emergency surgery and then becky goes into labor. Um, so he's up on like the fifth floor getting emergency surgery. Becky's given labor to our youngest son on the second floor. So I'm going back and forth between the fifth floor on the second floor. And I'm like dragging my leg at this point cause it just stopped working. Um, but you know, I was all in and refuse any care till I get these two taken care of.

Speaker 3:          00:10:52       Well, we get Jason out of surgery. Uh, you know, he's on the road to recovery, get down for the birth. Uh, we have our son Joe, Joe, he's good to go. And then it turns out, uh, they finally rushed me to imaging and I have a blood clot in my leg and it's broken off into both long. So now I have a bilateral pulmonary embolisms and at this point they're like, hey man, like we have a very small window here. This is very high mortality rate. And A, I'm like laughing at them because like, you know, I was drunk at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       No bullshit. And I'm like, you guys think this is going to kill me, get in line. This isn't the vis a long line of offenders here that, that I want a shot at that. But um, so anyway, so I'm sitting there in the hospital room and I'm just wondering and waiting for somebody to come explain to me like how life has spiraled out of control like this. And like somebody's going to say, hey, this is a reason that you have these blood clots. You know, here's what's going on with your head and all these things. And it just, it never happens. And I remember like, I got to go down and visit my son, uh, who was, uh, in emergency recovery and I was there at his hospital bed and, uh, I had a bottle of whiskey or airplane bottle of whiskey and I popped the last pain pill I ever took and I shot down the whiskey.

Speaker 3:          00:12:06       That was just normal 24, seven. How I operated at that time, tried to just to cope and a, I had this epiphany, you know, that hey, if I continue on this same track and I continue to just wholesale buy, everything in the medical system is, is telling me it's going to kill me and it's going to ruin everything that I love so I can stay on that route or I can decide to act and to change what I don't like. And at that point it was everything. And so I made the promise to my son right then and there that I was going to do some things. One, I was going to get off all medication and I was going to return to the man of my pre-injury status too. I was going to find a way to heal myself. And then three, I was going to turn around and do that same thing for somebody else.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       And so right then and there and the hospital's bed, and I mean this is the honest to God, true story. I said, I don't care how, I don't know how, but I've had enough. I've had enough of people telling me that my life is over. And at that time, you know, my identity was in special forces and that was taken away because of the medical injuries. And I said, I don't care anymore. I'm still a husband. I'm still a father and I'm going to get better. And that was enough to pull me out of there, out of that negative spiral that I was in. And to start being proactive again and start being defined by a vision of the future. And my vision of the future was just what I said. And I didn't know it was going to lead to where we're at today, but that was the catalyst.

Speaker 3:          00:13:41       And so I started going and looking for alternative therapies and it turned out like the government didn't want to pay for anything that wasn't covered by their insurance. Well, that's fine. I'll charge it a max it on credit cards. That's fine. I'll get more credit cards. I don't care. I don't care if it's $1 million, I will get the money and I will get better and I will solve this problem. And, uh, then I started getting objective about it and that was like, you know, talking to everybody out there who's having head problems like, hey, what's working for you guys? And I got real interested in why did some things work for some people and then not work for others, you know, you know, precursor and meeting mark. But I'm starting to get really scientific minded or you know, one objective data to be able to support things.

Speaker 3:          00:14:21       And so there's all this, these other treatment modalities out there and I did every single one of them and some of them were little bit of a benefit in the short term. Some of them, you know, reversed or made symptoms worse. Um, but it was leading to that that we got some, some publicity out of it. Mark read about it and just contacted me and he didn't know anything else about me at that point, but he said, hey, you know, we've been treating Tbi for a number of years now here's my credentials, here's the background story on it. Here's some media that I had done and it was a podcast that you guys had done a couple back with. Uh, when, uh, he had matt Gaza Neon and I'm listening to Matt tell a story. And for the first time ever through hearing him, I was like, Holy Shit, this is, this isn't specific to me.

Speaker 3:          00:15:14       Like I got so wrapped up in myself like I thought like the whole world's on pause and this is, this is this my problem. And I realized, Oh my God, this is a much bigger problem that has wide reaching a repercussion is that doesn't just deal with me specifically. And so as I'm hearing matt talk about all the problems that he's having, it's like he's like tall telling my story to the teeth and then I hear mark say, well, not only that, but we can identify, uh, an underlying condition for all of the things that we were just talking about. And we can measure it objectively. And like, that just blew my mind. Cause I was like, here I am on 13 medications. And there wasn't one objective measurement where somebody said, let's put them on antidepressant depressant. Let's put him on another antidepressant. Let's put him on anti anxiety. I was like, there was nothing objective about that. I was like, wait a minute.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       So they're not, there was nothing you were saying there was nothing. They were measuring subjective as there's a level of this that we need to move up. There's a level of that we need to, right.

Speaker 3:          00:16:13       Yeah. Based off the symptoms and the complaints I had, it was just throwing darts. It's like I said, 13 medications from a person who never had any issue before

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       and to all the guys that have served that have gone through this kind of thing and not just guys that have served, but also when you're dealing with Tbi. We're talking about athletes, we're talking about former fighters. Yeah. A lot of guys that have been in contact with on a regular basis have these issues and what mark has done, which has been just phenomenal, was open up a new door for treatment to these people. And I have talked to so many people and I've been in contact with so many people that heard about you through the podcast that we've done together and heard about your work and have gone on to completely remove these medications.

Speaker 4:          00:17:00       Correct. You know, that's a problem in psychiatry is there are no real biological markers. They're trying to use a radiographic studies like Spec Scans, Mris, pet scans, and what have you as rationale for starting people on medication. But there's absolutely, you know, in the biomarker or the biomarker panel that we have, there's a direct correlation between someone having had a head trauma re regardless of it was mild or a blast trauma like Andrew had or a slip and fall or someone coming up and hitting you behind the headboard, mma or boxers or Muay tight and there's absolutely zero that they use to regulate what they're doing. It says, okay, today's Thursday, let's try this drug, or this is Friday or else this month we're giving you this Satchel of meds. As many of the vets have come up and told me, depending upon the day of the week dictated what groupings of medications they were given what, but let's break it down for people.

Speaker 4:          00:17:57       What do you feel is the underlying cause of all this? It's related to Tbi. Okay, great question. And the answer is number one from the head trauma, it elicits chemical changes in the brain that we call inflammation. And this inflammation leads to disruption of chemical processes. It's like, you know, the old alkaline batteries or the car batteries where we used to put distilled water into it. Well, if you put coca cola in it, it totally changes the ability of electrons to be conducted just like in the brain. So the chemistry of the brain is altered by the inflammation and it starts shutting down systems so that the nerves in left side of the brain can't talk to the right side, or the frontal lobe of the brain can talk to the temporal lobe of the brain. So you have disruption of, um, executive function, which is your ability to make correct decisions about things right and wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:18:48       Why do we have over a million veterans incarcerated? That's because they can't make the right correct decisions about how to respond to an innocuous, uh, you know, approach by an individual that they don't know and they respond by, uh, assault or with physical or anger or a yelling at people and that leads him into jail or into incarceration. So anyway, the inflammation leads to hormonal deficiencies in the brain. And what we've found is that there's, since 1986, Dr Baylew out of Paris found that we have enzyme systems that take cholesterol and convert it into hormones that actuate and regulate our brain function from schizophrenia to als, to Parkinson's disease, to bipolar, to all the different disorders. There was a recent article that I sent out to our journal Group and Andrew's in it, and it was about management event, thigh of neuroinflammation, brain inflammation to treat psychiatric diseases.

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       And in the past six months, we've been starting to see a lot of articles talking specifically about inflammation, creating all these things that we're trying to treat with medications that are ineffective. Uh, last month, uh, had a class in, uh, Arizona and I presented a group of articles and one of the key articles was the fact that they found people with atypical depression. That's depression that doesn't respond to traditional medication. So you're on whole bunch 13 medications and you're still depressed. So they found in 61% of these people who were still depressed with atypical depression, that they had growth hormone deficiency. And then when they replaced the growth hormone within one to two months, their depression disappeared. And they had some beneficial side effects. They slept better, they had more mental energy, they were socially more adaptable, and they're reactive scores that creates, you know, an assault situation.

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       They were calm, someone said booted them and they said, Oh, who do? As opposed to getting into their face. So it's a very clear, and it's becoming clearer and clearer in the literature around the world. Now we've been doing this since 2004 and the inflammation is really the problem. So unfortunately there is no specific medication. They talk about use of aspirin and Ibuprofen in things like Alzheimer's disease, which is an inflammatory disease. I know I shared it with you in the past that if a football player has one major concussion on the field, he's 19 times at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's between 30 and 49 years of age because it's an inflammatory illness. It's not, you know, genetics by itself. There are people with genetic predisposition to it because they generate this thing called Beta amyloid. But trauma, any kind of trauma to the head can elicit increased production of Beta amyloid and lead to these problems.

Speaker 4:          00:21:46       So the, the traumatic brain injury causes this inflammation. And there's a, there's a process that goes on when the brain is dealing with this inflammation. And that's what's disrupting all of these normal functions. Executive functions. Absolutely. And you know, we have different, um, relay centers in our brain that regulate whether or not you're going to be calm or you going to be hyper, have anxiety. One of the products that we use 100% natural, about 80% of our treatment is all natural products with 10 to 20% being pharmaceutical products, but no psychotropic or brain altering medications slugging. What, what kind of products do you use? Training alone, pregnenolone. There's 6,160 articles talking about its beneficial effect on anxiety. So we have people who come in on a multitude of anxiety medications within three months. They're off all their medication. They're alone. Pregnenolone is called the mother of all hormones.

Speaker 4:          00:22:41       It's the precursor. It comes right off of cholesterol. The first comp, uh, changed cholesterol becomes pregnenolone, which goes down one pathway to become testosterone and then down another pathway to become cortisol, which is the anti inflammatory product. So we get benefits of, you know, antiinflammatory effect by having pregnenolone. But if you're on any kind of stat and drug that decreases the availability of cholesterol in the brain or the body, you lose. I have heard nothing but bad things about staten drugs. Don't get me going. I want to get you going because there's so many people that have this very meager understanding of cholesterol and a understanding of like what is the difference between having a, you know, high cholesterol, low cholesterol, what, you know, what is, what's healthy, what's not healthy? What's your cholesterol mark? My cholesterol is 350. My ldl is, and it should be according to the present standards, less than 200.

Speaker 4:          00:23:38       My ldl cholesterol is two 73 my uh, which is the ldl is the lousy kind and Hdl, which is the happy to have the healthy one is like 23 to 40. How did the numbers change over time? They're all saying no for the state, for the standard. Oh, of where they used to measure from the 70s till now in my infancy in medicine, uh, back in the late eighties, it was 349 and then went to 329 then two 79 then to 49 to 29 in less than 200 now. And we would expect our nutrition is changing the quality of foods that we eat. And the fact that we have since 1986 staten drugs, which are $36 billion a year, we would anticipate that the rate of cardiovascular disease should be diving, getting lower. It's not, it's going up. So what does it tell us? It tells us like a Smithkline Beecham us study that was done.

Speaker 4:          00:24:31       50% of all heart attacks happen in people with normal or low levels of cholesterol. So the question is then what's causing it? Well, it turns out inflammation. You start looking at inflammatory chemistry. We, there's a group of um, inflammatory markers that we have a which sdl, dl, homocysteine LP, little a. So a whole group of them that can predict better than cholesterol, your risk for heart disease. And what we do in the offices, we have a biomarker panel for cardiac inflammation. Person comes in, they've got a history of elevated cholesterol. One of my closest buddies, Keith, uh, x fighter pilot, his clusteral one 41 50 my cholesterol 303 50 we went and had an ultra fast ct scan that looks at the heart and his calcium score was greater than 2000 which if it's a hundred or less as good grade than 400 horrible. Mine was zero and I had cholesterol that was three times his.

Speaker 4:          00:25:28       So after he had his open heart surgery and his New v arteries put in, we went and had this panel called an lp six my cholesterol sky high, but all these inflammatory markers, low and keith situation, his inflammatory markers were sky high even though his cholesterol was very low. Yeah, there's a simplistic understanding of what what's causing these issues and people peg it on cholesterol and you hear it so often, so many times, and you're like, boy, how do I even begin having this conversation with people? I would like to, if anybody's listening and you want to really get into this, a doctor Rhonda Patrick went pretty deep on it in the last podcast that we did and the newly found connections between refined sugars and refined carbohydrates and saturated fats. The combination of the two seems to be a gigantic issue where a saturated fats on their own are not an issue. The small particle versus large particle Ldl, small particles are the dangerous ones, right? Stld is dangerous, but it's at greater risk when you have an enzyme called a pla two in the blood, which causes the stld. L does small density Ldl to fracture into two parts that cause the immune system to be called in and once the immune system

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       gets there, it creates all this inflammation and there's something that happens with ldl. When you combine it with a refined sugars that's extremely bad for you. It makes it worse. Yeah, extremely bad sugars, corn syrup, things that people are drinking sodas and cake and bullshit, all the refined bread and we products. All that stuff is fucking terrible for you. Well, it's just adding more inflammation on top of it. And it's being conflated with saturated fats and with cholesterol. And it's, it's not what the issue is. Correct. So think about if you have a brain injury and you're eating like that, you know what I mean? Just like your [inaudible] on a fire and having no idea about it. Like that's the issue that we face a lot of times. So there's, there's the inflammation response and then there's also the, the issues with the pituitary gland and the hormonal deficiencies.

Speaker 5:          00:27:36       Well, it's, it's not only the two Terry Glen, which generates the, uh, signals to the thyroid gland, testicles at the ovaries to make their hormones are the adrenal glands, but it's the fact that the, um, we call them glial cells, which are astrocytes and neuro cells, which generate their own hormones. And it turns out that the hormones produced a below the neck have a genomic effect on the body, which is slow. It means it turns on genetic switches to do things. But the hormones produced in the brain called the neuro steroids. They have the immediate effect because they influence the membranes of neurons to do things. So our ability to be rational because you're taking different parts of the brain and they're all working in unison as opposed to having this section that deals with, you know how you respond to someone talking in a high voice to you or pointing a gun at you or pointing at Pencil at you so you lose that integration of the different parts of the brain.

Speaker 5:          00:28:35       That's what each of the lobes is responsible for is how we integrate signals coming in that the whole thing is so fascinating because it seems like there's so much to understand and for, for the average person that goes to your general practitioner and the General Practitioner says, Oh, I've got high cholesterol. You need to be on a stat and drug, and then you find out about all this. People get extremely angry. I've talked to so many people that were on staten drugs and suffered all sorts of health consequences because of that and then realize, oh, what about cutting all the fucking sugar out of my diet? What about doing, doing all this stuff that has been shown in all these more recent studies to have a significant effect? Absolutely. It's unfortunate that when science comes out and it's really good science that it takes another 20 to 30 years before it gets into the medical community. And there's no obligation for your general practitioner to be up on this dot. No, absolutely not. Because it's status quo and it's changing constantly. Yes, and that's what has me and frustrated state all the time is because of the science that's been sitting on the bench. What I do, what I've been told I do is called

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       translational medicine, where I take the research that's on the bench that's already been done and I look at it in large groups and then applied into the clinical practice. And that's how we've had our success is we've got us, we've taken the stuff that's sitting there ready to be used that's not being used because we're in the paradigm of don't do anything for 30 years. I mean every generation a little bit, something better happens, but it takes 30 years.

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       It's incredibly frustrating. So Andrew, please go back to how you found out about mark and what changes you made and what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:30:18       [inaudible] yeah. Well, um, cause I've only known you since you've been happy. It's been a good ride, but you know, if you lower cholesterol mark, it ruins all the hormonal production. Correct. Right. And, uh, so that's not understood. But so, uh, I mark found me, I looked into everything. I was just saying one over, listen to listen to that research, did my own research, found out about the neuroendocrine system and ran it by my own people. And so I went and saw an endocrinologist. I was still in the army at this time. And I was saying, Hey, do you think that any of these problems were based off of the, you know, hundreds or thousands of explosions that weave around on a, on a routine basis? He's like, no, I don't. I don't think so. And, uh, he was like a, I was like, well, can we test and replace any hormones that I'm missing?

Speaker 3:          00:31:10       Because, I mean at that time we had done some tests and I knew that I was deficient in things and he's like, ah, I'm going to test you for anabolic steroids because I think the reason you're having these problems is you're abusing anabolic steroids and if you pass the test and you prove that you're not on anabolic steroids, which will take about four to six weeks, then we'll talk about it. Replacement Treatment Program. And I was fucking irate man. Like I told him that he accused, you accuse me of being a, going to him because his levels were so low. Yeah. He's like, he's like, I've never seen levels this low unless somebody was abusing anabolic steroids. And so you must be abusing antibiotics, steroids and, and you're here essentially trying to score drugs.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       Well, if people don't understand what you're saying, um, when you take antibiotics, steroids, your natural testosterone shuts down. A lot of times when people get off steroids, then they'll go to a doctor, they're natural testosterone to shut down and they'll go to a doctor to try to get hormone replacement therapy because the only way a doctor is going to give you hormone replacement therapies if your levels are low. And so one of the reasons for having low levels is that you've, you've put all this exotic in his shit in there and it's, you know, your, your whole body's all confused.

Speaker 3:          00:32:23       Yeah. So thanks for clarifying that mark. Like I a what? Who was it like, hey man, you think I'm coming in here putting all this personal stuff on you because I like, I like to make things up just cause you want steroids cause I want steroid wants, my life's a disaster and I think this is funny and I worry that he would you, you know what I mean? It happened, it happened twice. Joe, twice back to back. You understand that there's other issues that cause your body to have low testosterone. That's what's crazy. So this is what puts to push us in this direction, man. So I was like, well, I sat at that point, I started reading some of the literature and I was like, it's not even black. I mean, it's not even in the gray area. This is black and white. There's like blast trauma can through inflammation affect the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland and downregulate all these hormones.

Speaker 3:          00:33:08       And so anyways, so I finally, I link up with mark in southern California. Um, we run the labs, but we don't get the results back for like two or three weeks. But he gives me a, what we call it, provocative testosterone injection, just to see how I react. And like up until this point, man, like my life has just been a complete disaster. I mean, I've put a gun in my mouth several times and actually had thought about like, if this is how life is going to continue and I continue to have this type of negative effect on my family, I think I'll just end it, man. You know what I mean? And, um, and I got to the point where I was just like, I can't do it for my family alone. And just kept driving. So found mark, mark found me, got the information and actually is there to see him in his office in Encino.

Speaker 3:          00:33:55       Get that injection. I'm driving south on the four oh five I'm in bumper to bumper traffic like two hours later. And usually man like me and traffic just didn't mix. Um, and to say that I had a hostile temper was like the understatement of the year. And I realized like, Hey, I'm all of a sudden I'm cool, I'm calm, I'm collected and not having any issues. I'm like, Whoa, I f I don't feel any anxiety. Like for the last year and a half, I like it had this fist like coming out of my stomach man, like at all times 24, seven. It was horrible. And it was gone. And I was like, if this is any taste of what could be, this is incredible. And I call my wife and we have a conversation for like an hour. And that's the first time that we had talked more than two minutes in like a year.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       And I didn't just say yes or no because I just wasn't capable of, of anything else at that time. And um, so fast forward for a few weeks from there, you know, he gets the report back and he's like, hey man, you're deficient in everything. You know, but we can, we can fix this. And so we get on anti-inflammatory protocol and we replaced, we replaced the and replenish the hormones that are deficient or insufficient and life slowly and surely started to turn back on little by little by little, by little to where I'm at today, I'm off all medication. Uh, you know, I'm clean, I'm sober, uh, performing as good, if not better than my pre-injury status. We startup organization called the Warrior Angels Foundation to deliver this same level of healing to other people who are in the exact same predicament and situation. And now I'm excited to say, man, three years later we've delivered to over 200 people with incredible results.

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       So it meets with the scientific criteria we can predict, we can measure and we can replicate. And now it's not just my story, it's not just Mac os and he's Tori. Mark's done this like 1400 times. We had done it 200 times through our organization where somebody, like we did a three year Tbi study cohort, we took 58 of a, of those 200 people, just the ones that are committed, attempted suicide, 58 individuals attempted suicide. We had, we showed that within three months they, um, what was it? 91% had a 50% improvement. Correct. So almost everybody had at least a 50%. This isn't their subjective analysis improvement. After one year 90, uh, let's see, 73% of that population was off all medication. This is unheard of. This is unheard of. And this is people that wanted, that actually attempted to take their own life, I think a minimum of two times in our study.

Speaker 3:          00:36:31       So we're, we're, we're producing results that have never been annotated before. You know what I mean? And it's through the scientific model that marks come up with this protocols. It's unbelievable. That's on our website. Uh, we got, we got all that research on our website to check Waf, tbi.org, but I got marks Predator as well. I got mark's presentation. We got an incredible media page, a library of all this information that didn't exist three years ago. It's now all in one location and all the stuff that I'm saying here, please don't take my word for word. You guys go out and fact check it. And I can't tell you how many guys have come up to me after shows that have either been in contact with you or have been in contact with other doctors because of the information that you've given out. And it was so thankful and so, and they're like, you changing peoples future, you're literally giving them an option that they didn't know existed. They thought they thought their world was black and then you open the door and like, oh, you can be okay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       When Andrew first came to be, uh, Andrew wasn't the first veteran that I had seen. The first guy that I took care of was in 2009 he was active greenbrae and in North Carolina at Bragg and his wife, I knew she was emergency room doc and she called me up and told me about her husband getting ready to get a less than honorable discharge after four or five tours of duty in Afghanistan. And uh, she explained it to me. I said, let me send you a kit. So I sent a kid out and we got the results back. I told her what to do, she put them on to treatment. He lasted another two sign up towards or two towards the duty and was doing phenomenally well. But the key that drives me on this is guys getting back into life, going to pepperdine business school. Now a guy who was, um, attempted school five times and the fifth time he was on our protocol for two or three months, he ends up getting honors and now he wants to go back and give back to the va for them not having treated him optimally by going into sociology to try and help them to understand what he had gone through with us. We have guys who are in Wall Street now and

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       all over, I mean I'm a Harvard business school. I mean just all kinds of very prestigious thing. They've got their family back there re calling their parents going on for a couple of years. We didn't give them a self help book. We didn't give him any snow, Churchill teachings, anything else, just fix what was deficient. Right. And they were able to come back and make their own their own choices. They get their life back on track is such a giant factor in this whole equation that people need to understand. It's not just about motivational speeches. It's not about memes that you put on your instagram page to make you feel better about life. It's literally about the chemical balance in your physical vehicle. And if it's off, you're going to be off. And if it's off because of diet, if it's off because of injury, whatever the factors are, you've got to figure out what those factors are and you've got to correct them. You got to correct them before self-help, before all that bullshit, correct your diet, correct. Whatever is deficient in your hormone levels, whatever is deficient in your nutrient levels. It's so God damn it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:36       Absolutely. And I don't mean to, you know, focus only on the neuro steroid and the inflammation, as you just said, physical fitness and nutrition. You know, my daughter Alison is a natural pathic and she works with us with the warrior Angel Foundation to help with getting the gut brain in sync so that you don't have the glutens, you don't have all the junk we talked about because it, they generate the poor nutrition, generates more inflammation that passes through the gut into the blood, into the brain. And they've actually, there was a study that came out of, it was on the bbcs last week where they were talking about, oh, we finally figured out that if you have peripheral inflammation like diseases like Lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, that the inflammation goes into the brain and can cause depression. Well, it's been in the literature for 30 years. They finally are starting to understand that things that happened on the periphery, you can affect our brain's functioning. So nutrition very important

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       is part of what's going on to just the the human bodies. So insanely complex and there's so much to understand and so much to be you have to kind of be like you are, you have to be obsessed with all this stuff. I didn't think I was obsessed. You're obsessed by pull out my phone up to your face a little bit more, but you're you, what you are doing though is just, it's, it's so important and so it, there's just so little of it out there for people. This is part of the problem. It's like you have to really go looking for these solutions. I mean, you got to go through every door in every channel and try to find out. And so many times they want to offer you some sort of a pill, some sort of a pharmaceutical drug. It's some sort of an antidepressant antianxiety medication. And if that one doesn't take, they give you an antianxiety medication on top of the anti anxiety medication, fuck,

Speaker 4:          00:41:24       uh, lunch or dinner with the admiral in, uh, Virginia Beach, the beginning of this year. And one of the stories that he was sharing was fact that his wife,

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       uh, was diagnosed at a va as having a thyroid related issues. So they started treating it in the course of treating it, she felt worse because they weren't giving her the ample amount of replacement hormones. So the next thing that the doctor offers her as an antidepressant, saying the reason why you still not feeling well, it's because the antidepressant. And when we got to her and checked out or hormone levels, her hormone levels were off. And did they even check her hormone levels? No, of course not. You know, they hand those Goddamn antidepressants out like fucking candy.

Speaker 3:          00:42:03       That's what was crazy with me. So I was like, there's gotta be an underlying condition. Like in summary, tell me what that is. I know we've got, we're managing symptoms, but can we do that and can we do it objectively or scientifically? And that's the beauty of, of of the protocol. Because again, to break it down for everybody out there, Tbi, it's a two phase injury phase one is that a physical trauma or assault? You know, it could be black, uh, uh, explosive blast way, blunt force, trauma acceleration, deacceleration slip, fall rollercoaster. Anything that causes that anti inflammatory cascade to start rollercoaster can cause it. The coordinator Mario Cannon, the literature. Yeah, but just think man, like, so mark calls it the neuro permissive environment. So if you don't have a good internal environment, like you're eating a bunch of processed foods, sugar, you're leaving just a, a low quality of life, making poor lifestyle decisions.

Speaker 3:          00:42:52       Those things, how are like compounding interest over time, uh, are being like low level blast waves. And it could be something as simple as one of those 300 mile per hour moving roller coaster. It's going to rock your head back and forth. That could be enough to be, you know, hey, that's enough. That could cause the inflammation and the inflammatory cascade and then that causes the hormones to become deficient or insufficient. That's what we found through our research, at least our, that's what our research suggests is that's the process. And if you don't get rid of the inflammation or bring the body back into a balance, if you don't replenish or replace those hormones that are lost, you're going to have all the physical and psychological manifestations that we all know about and talked about. And so that's the deal. Can we be objective? Yes, we can. Can we measure it? Yes, we can. Can we predict and replicate? Well, we've done it 1400 times so we can, so now it's like, okay, well how do we continue to take this to the next level to make sure this goes mainstream? It's disseminating information on platforms like this. We're working projects with the government. Like right now. We think we might be able to actually affect change on a real level here the next few years. Yeah, it's, it's so incredible

Speaker 5:          00:44:03       that there is finally some sort of a resource that there's something that people could turn to, but uh, we need to lay it out. Like there's, it's gotta be every point, right? It's gotta be nutrition. It's got to be exercise. It's got to be reducing the inflammation. It's gotta be replacing the hormones, all those things together. When, when, uh, an individual is suffering with symptoms, I call it symptomatic Tbi. I don't really agree with the term pts or ptsd or ptss especially

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       when there's a history of trauma, trauma, trauma to the body or trauma to the brain. Yeah. It's not necessarily, I think people think of it as like stressful situations that guys have been through. And one of the things that I've found in talking to a lot of guys who are operators is they don't have like a high stress level because of what they've seen. Like there, the, there were the actors, they were the ones who are doing the things. There weren't, there's a lot of, the stress level comes from a lot of the guys that we're not being proactive. They're waiting around for something to happen to them. And those are the guys that are the most effected by Stress Disorders. The guys who were wondering when they were going to be attacked. Whereas guys who are operators who are out there aggressive out there being proactive actually correct doing it. They had less of a situation with that. Less stress meditation for them going out and killing people.

Speaker 3:          00:45:21       You're on the offensive, right? Yeah. So I mean I can speak from experience here. You're, you're on the offensive. You're not waiting to get on there. So when you're stuck in this, what it is is a fight or flight mechanism, you know what I mean? You're on security mode, uh, in a non combat environment. And so these guys get stuck in these fight or flight modes and they can't figure out why, why am I in fight or flight like this? This situation does not call for that type of response. And then you look at it like if you're deficient in these things, what's the body going to do if these got these mics, electrical signals or they're sharing of neurons, it's going to come out as a fight or flight mechanism and that's why they're stuck in this and that's, it's called post traumatic stress. But when we've treat these so called psychological issues as a physical injury and replace and replenish, lower the inflammatory cascades, guess what? Those symptoms resolve themselves whether they were, whether they were on the defensive or offensive. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       That's fascinating. But there's definitely a psychological difference between someone who becomes a seal or a ranger or a green baret there. There's a documented yes, there's a, there's a difference in the mindset and you know those, those people are some of the most important people we have in the planet. Correct. You have to have them. You want to have a safe world. You have to have the elite of the elite. You have to like and people who don't understand that you need to go to some really terrible places in the world and understand what's out there. You know, looking across the spectrum of special ops and then the regular army. We've talked about this in the past. The pattern that I've been seeing also in in civilian population is those people who are more eight type get better, faster. They want to get better as opposed to the people who really don't want to get,

Speaker 3:          00:47:09       or you've seen it time and time again. It's like if you have a clear vision of the future and it's like, Hey, I'm going to get better. Like I don't care what anybody else says. Like they were like the 10th stop that they've come to their like, we've tried everything, we just found a, you guys were going to do something, let's get this going. But those guys get better. Not, I mean, not to mention, of course, objectively we can, we can

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       push look at it, but people come to us and you're like, ah, I don't know. Life doesn't work out and everything goes my way. You know? I hope this goes, but I'm not getting my hopes up. Anything else? Those people will talk themselves out of getting better and I wouldn't have believed it unless I've seen it time and time and time again, hills people mentally fucked themselves out of life. Every step of the show we've watched him put a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger, you know what I mean? Unfortunately we've lost people to do in that and it wasn't like, hey, we got, we got you the help. And then it was like, well it's such a hassle to take the medication at the prescribed times. And I'm like, what? What? And then I looked into that and like that's a thing called noncompliance.

Speaker 5:          00:48:11       Like, uh, the Glaucoma Research Institute put out a study like 60% of glaucoma patients don't take their medication on time. No one that that will cause them to go blind. Because I had needed to, I needed to justify losing some people that I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my head around and like, why won't they be compliant? They people get in this Rut and they memorize these emotions and they get in this negative fucking place, man. And they, they talk themselves right out of life. And why people become super comfortable with repeating these really negative patterns. They get comfortable because they know those patterns. It's very disturbing when you see someone who's, you know, I grew up with a lot of guys that had drug problems and when you would see they would get hooked on coke or something like that and get off of it and know that they're on a better path, but it's pulling them back in and not even physically like the, the, the process of doing something that's fucked up and ruining your life somehow or another, it becomes more comfortable than the process of the unknown, which is improving your life.

Speaker 5:          00:49:16       It's, it's scary to people, to people they know the of the devil. They don't, you know what I mean? And I think at a neuroscience level, right? They could memorize an emotion cause what I those thoughts and freaky. Yeah, yeah. Whoa re structure of the brain through neuroplasticity. And that can be their new status quo. Right. How do you get people that are in that mindset? How do you get them free of that? I mean, how do you get someone who's this woe is me. It never works out, you know? Is there a way, I mean, is there a tried and true way, man, to direct my health, trying to, I wrecked my health tourism, but we've had a couple of guys who had stopped their protocol because they didn't feel that anything was happening from it and they send me an email after they had been off for maybe a month. I says, Jeez, I don't feel as well, maybe it was working or they say that we're working with the devil and and go all kinds of weird. Yeah. I stopped January accepting a Pi cases, you know, legal cases because what's the impetus for them to get better? Yeah, zero. They get what they want to pitch a personal injury, like the motor vehicle accident there. One disability check. Yeah. Yeah, so I stopped taking Pi cases. That's unfortunate because there's gotta be some

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       people that have real personal injuries that would like to get better. I talked to everybody, I filter them, but generally speaking, I've cut down, I just come to the conclusion, you know, like, Hey, I can't make the decision. I can't make anybody get better. Right. You know what I mean? Like all we can do is give out the information, but I mean shoes on and make them go to like literally made myself sick, like worried about people like, oh my God, you know, we're going to lose something and I can't like, man, I can't do anything. All I can do is I can control my attitude and my effort and I can push out this information to the best of my ability and people got to meet us halfway. You know what I mean? Like there's nothing we can do to make somebody want to get themselves better.

Speaker 3:          00:51:08       Talking with the guy tomorrow is his brother's at wit's end and just wrecking everything that he comes in and out of every rehab program. Uh, just as a, it's a horrible place. It's, it's, I don't see an end in well, and I'm going to talk to him tomorrow because he wants to know how can I make my brother want to get better? And I'm like, brother, I love you man, but we can't do, I can't force somebody to do that and that disaster, I don't know. The tragic part of that I think is, um, you know, the person's not thinking right because they're, their judgments clouded because of a head injury. You know, serving the country. It's, it's, it's, it's a bummer. One of the battles that we have also is that people, relationships, I speak to wipes that are a strange husbands that are strange when we take on a new veteran or patient, uh, to let them know that the person that they've been dealing with post traumatic brain injury is not really the person they want to be.

Speaker 3:          00:52:05       That's an effect of the hormonal dysfunctioning. So they're depressed, they're angry, they're, you know, they're difficult to be around. So I tried to get them to help in the protocol to get them better in what we've seen are couples getting back together. We have a 77 year old, a Vietnam veteran who lost everything. He's back with his kids now he's out and back chopping wood and Boston. You know, just, that's the reward that really is the reward. But people have to understand that if that you've had traumatic brain injury, anticipate within one year's time, total change in the person, total change. They're now no longer the person that you anticipate. How long did it take you for that transition? Well, it was, uh, I started first having symptoms like six months after I got home. You know what I mean? So that's the difficult part.

Speaker 3:          00:52:53       Like you're not missing a limb, so you don't think anything like, we are rocking and rolling, come back, good to go, happy to be alive. Let's get ready for the next one. And then boom, stuff starts happening and it's like, oh my gosh, what's going on? You know? Um, but you can't see anything and you just keep going and you keep seeing this low quality of life and then you want help and you can't get help. Uh, you asked for help, you're getting medication, start drinking, sleep gets messed up, nutrition gets messed up, start wrecking relationships, then start thinking about, I'll never be able to do what I thought I was supposed to do. Nobody understands me. Um, what's the future gonna be like, like this, you know, and it doesn't get neat. And that's how you get trapped into these memorizing these negative states.

Speaker 3:          00:53:43       Cause you get stuck in that for you. You heard mark on the podcast, how long did it take you to act and how long did it take after their tea for you to become who you are now? It's, so I made that decision at my son's bedside and that was, uh, several months before I met mark. Well heres this, how many years ago? This is 2000, uh, 14. January 7th, September of 2014 and I didn't meet him until December, 2014. Right? So, uh, it was all of 2014. It was just a disaster, right. Leading up to the hospital scene. So I made the decision like, Hey, at that point it was like, you know what? I've always been defined by my future, but all of a sudden like, you know, like being a special forces greenbrae was my mask. We all wear our masks and that's how I, uh, that that was my identity, or at least I thought it was.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       And so when that got taken away from me, it was like, well, what am I going to do now? And now I'm sick and now my children are sick and now they're telling me like I have a brain injury. Like what does that mean? Like that this is like just getting rocked. So like being rocked by circumstances knocked me for a year and a half, just, it knocked me and like I wasn't prepared, I wasn't ready. I didn't know how to deal with it. And it wasn't until I made that decision that I was like, no, I've always been defined by going after the future that I want to create. I'm going back to that. And it was like, so there was like a will, you know, that was to it. Like, I don't know where it came from, but like I could observe my thoughts and I was like, these thoughts that are being produced now or not me, I don't know where they're coming from, but there is a will inside me that says we're gonna fight this and we're going to, we're going to find a way to come out on the other side.

Speaker 3:          00:55:24       So that happened in September, you know, uh, fast forward to finding mark. So it was like quick, like after three months of the protocol, like physiologically I felt like myself again, I was off all medication every three miles. How long did it take you to get off the medication? Did you Turkey, [inaudible] Turkey, they say, you should never do that. Never do that. I would just have that in place in my life. Doctors, no, I, how's that? A place in my life that I was like, Hey, I am, I accept whatever fallout could happen, but whatever I'm going to feel it's not going to be artificial. I'm just going to feel whatever it is and I'm a, and I'm going to deal with it on, on my terms. And I'm not going to be zombied out. It was rough. It was rough. Um, so I, I was off all medication before I got to mark, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       And so, uh, I didn't like, I didn't have control of like my mind the way I wanted to like the way I do now. So it was, I had to work very hard and not just to lose it on people. For instance, like we were, um, my was with my wife, we were in a fast food restaurant picking up some food for my youngest daughter. And so I'm going there, grabbing some food. I see this kid, teenager in the parking lot and he, I don't know, this kid throws his cup down, he's cussing, he's causing the scene. I felt like I needed to intervene. I don't know why. So I'm like, Hey man, pick your cup up, throw in the trash, quit yelling customers everywhere families are here. And he tells me to go fuck myself. And I'm like, dude, go pick up your stuff and put in the trash.

Speaker 3:          00:56:56       And he said the same thing. And before I knew it, I just backhanded this kid across the face, dropped them on the ground, and then I picked him up and I threw him into oncoming traffic. Oh Jesus. Yeah. Well the parking lot took offense to that. Right? It's right. Rightly rightly so. You know what I mean? And so I got people swarming me. Next thing I know, like I dropped like three dudes in the parking lot and I look up after dropping the last guy and like my wife's breastfeeding and three of my children are looking at me and like they're in, they're an like horror is on their face. Just horror struck. And I'm like, my God man, if I don't get control of myself, like not only is this going to possibly kill me, I'm going to kill somebody else. You know what I mean? Like I had, I felt like I, I just, I didn't know what happened. Something happened. Boom. I came to and it was like, Dear God, I just dropped a parking lot and I'm doing evasive maneuvers in my fucking minivan trying to get out of it.

Speaker 3:          00:57:53       Oh my God, I'm funny. But not, but not funny. You know what I mean? So, you know, it was, it was this process of, um, so it was rough man. It was rough coming off medication. I don't recommend it from anybody for anybody else, but it was like, hey man, like I want off of that. Cause that just made me a Zombie, just like drooling on myself. Zone B. What steps did you take as far as your diet and exercise and then mark's protocol? I eat, uh, you know, basically try to anti inflammatory diet, you know what I mean? Um, and that's just based off my individual needs at that time. Um, I would just remaining active. So what I mean by anti inflammatory diet, what did you do differently? Uh, well, just learning what causes inflammation, right? So where are we talking about? Like refined sugars, refined carbohydrates, getting away from things that were packaged for me, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:58:42       Going back to more wholesome, whole foods. And this is before mark's protocol or, no, this is, this is, this is after I'm on it. You know what I mean? So I didn't make any changes until I got up anything until I got into mark's protocol. Started to like return to normalcy. And then when you get to that level, you start feeling really good again. You're like, well, what else can I do? You know what I mean? And that's, that's like been the steps that we've seen in so many people. Like we don't have to make any lifestyle changes initially, like thrill make them on their own. So get them back to a homeostasis or balance and neuro permissive environment and mark as mark calls it. And then you start looking at like, well, what else do I need to do in my life to optimize it?

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       And for me, man, it was like, I'm going to take a look at water, I'm going to be taking a look at, uh, light, sound, emf, like every external, you know, stimulus. I want to optimize and make sure, like it's as optimized as possible. Well, so, um, did you do any changes to the way you exercise? Let me think about that. Not Really, man. Uh, I was kind of into Olympic lifting at the time and stayed with that. Um, uh, physical, physically, always remain physically active through the whole thing. Um, so not a, probably the only thing that probably kept you sane. Yeah, absolutely. And another reason they said that I lived through the, uh, the blood clots was the level of cardiovascular fitness that I was in at the time. You know what I mean? So, uh, yeah. But yeah, that was like, you know, one Goto, like I just always worked out.

Speaker 3:          01:00:11       I've always been, that's always been a part of my life. And so that was always there. So stuck with that. So three months in, how did you feel and what was the difference? I felt night and day different. No more anxiety, no more depression. No more balance issues. No more double vision. No more blurry vision. No more migraine headaches. Uh, no more memory problems. Like back on, like I could go back to operating and you know what I mean? And Oh, hey, 33 disability according to the va hundred percent service-related disabled is what? 33? What were they? Oh Gosh, dude. Like I named them like uh, everything, every kind of psychological disorder that you could think of, like double digit like I was given, you know what I mean? Depressed, anxiety, insomnia, so like psychotic. Yeah, just all, all these different things and then just a whole host of physical injuries as well that they've been documented over time, but they're just like 33 disabilities, 100% disabled.

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       I don't, I'm not missing a beat man. I'm not in any chronic pain. I don't have any symptomology of any of those things and we've that's not specific or special to me. Right. Like mark, how can we've been able to take so many dudes come off of their pain medication without going into withdrawals like we need. You need to talk about that. That's crazy. Matthew was here. Matthew was on 16 medications. One of the medications was oxycontin. He was on 80 milligrams a day. He was a morphine sulfate, 240 milligrams a day. He was on fentanyl patches and in six weeks, no patches. Fentanyl patches on top of it. Every anesthesiologists that I run by with what he was on, said the guy shouldn't be walking. Well, he flew down from, from Washington to come his tolerance, it must've just been off the charts tolerance stuff, tolerance and you know, he had six pins in his draw, shrapnel out of the left side of his head and his right leg was shot. And um, that's the reason why they justify it all his medications six weeks after starting the protocol, unique for him based on the biomarkers. He was on two medications a year later,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       he's off all his medications and he moves to Hollywood to become an actor and a screenwriter. Totally function, no pain. We're going to fuck him up more than anything else to go back on 17 medications, right? No, but the question was, I started seeing this pattern as andrew brought up, we're guys, we're getting offered their medications and no withdrawal. So I went back to the literature and started seeing the things about Nibin all a and b receptors, the more the opioid receptor alpha and Beta the mu receptors. And it turns out a lot of the things that we do modify it and modulating. And then more recently talking about pregnenolone, which is that mother of all hormones that comes off of cholesterol, where they're using it in people who are addicted to Benzodiazepines, which are, you know, valium and so forth, where they have side effects from being on such a high dose where they're sleeping all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:03:13       They give him pregnenolone and it decreases their fatigued during the day. And it turns out that we're value more benzodiazepines work on this thing called the Gaba a receptor, which is one of those relay stations. Um, pregnenolone is what is what should be given instead of giving someone a benzodiazepine. So that's how we've been able to get all our people off of antianxiety medication has with this pregnenolone because of how it functions and it's all out there. I didn't invent anything. It's just reading the literature. That's incredible. I love Brie. So it fits into the same cell receptors, the same receptor called the benzodiazepine receptor on the Gabba a that's crazy, man. Yeah. You've seen dudes that were, I didn't know what we were going to do. And like they're, I'm pain free, no pain, none. And coming, not coming off the meds with without withdrawals.

Speaker 4:          01:04:03       Critics. Were you, did they put you on tramadol or, yeah, a man, I don't even remember, but it was, it was a long time ago because he had been off of it. What are the things that disturbs me the most about this is what if someone like you wasn't around, like what you're, you're kind of an outlier in the medical community that you've really gravitated towards helping soldiers, helping people with Tbi for athletes, football players, fighters. What if you weren't around? I mean, I, I'm not hearing about this from a lot of guys. Well, Andrew and I, uh, in 2015 when my second third book came out on traumatic brain injury, when we started giving classes, very inexpensive classes for docs to come in and get trained. So to date, we've trained specifically on the technology, about 400 docs and they're going through a process of training and exams and so forth before they become part of our network. It's wire Angel Foundation Network, uh, so that we can disseminate the information and have more people involved. But this is such an important thing and it's such a common factor. There's so many people that are suffering from depression and anxiety and all these different issues that very easily could be attached, traumatic brain injuries

Speaker 2:          01:05:19       and, and people that don't even think they've had traumatic brain juice, sub concussive trauma. There's, there's a lot of people that have just done, they just been had a knock, knock and tumble rough and tumble life and then I'll realize it, but they've caused damage to their brain.

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       We see, we have patients who come in under our wellness program and when they're asked, have you ever had any traumatic brain injury? They say no, but you look at the bio markers and you see the pattern that they've had head trauma and then they say, oh yeah, when I was 18 there, you know, 53 years of age or 47 years of age. Oh yeah. When I was 18, I was in a car accident and I hit my left side of my head against the, uh, driver's side window. I did not, wasn't knocked out, didn't have nausea, didn't have vomiting. And you think because of that, that you're immune. Well, it turns out that 85% of all traumatic brain injuries are called mild for a reason. You don't have any symptoms. Yeah. Some people might have a little bit of a headache, uh, you know, or feeling fatigued.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       But for the most part they feel nothing. And then there's 15% that make up the moderate to severe where they're in a coma for periods of time. And we've actually had people who were in coma, some of our vets who have been in coma told, uh, connors, who was told that, uh, he'll never walk. He'll never be able to, you know, take care of himself. He'll die young and so forth. The Guy, he's married and he's walking, he's bicycle riding on, on, what is it? Facebook. He shows his pictures and so forth that, listen, this guy couldn't walk. They told him he wouldn't walk again. We've got three guys like that. And what was, what were they saying? They want the, uh, the imaging, right mark and still shows damage in the what? The gray matter. Oh, are the white matter and the white matter.

Speaker 4:          01:06:59       But he's made new connections and so now that's why he's able to do it because of the protocols allowed him to go back into this neuro permissive environment. So what does that mean? That means that he can experience new things. The brain is rewiring itself, even though there's physical damage to certain lobes because he can rewire itself, he can get better and he's walking. We have got three guys like that. It's crazy. All the hormones that we talk about, the testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, we relate to them as gender hormones, male or female. We reproductive hormones, sex hormones. It turns out that each one of them has a secondary function to Stastrom, stimulates the immune system to increase the white blood cells, the CD four and cd eight which are the protective kind of white blood cells. It also decreases the inflammation in our body called the t h one section of the immune system and stimulates the anti-inflammatory, Estradiol, progesterone, pregnenolone, now pregnenolone.

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       They all function to improve Alzheimer's conditions. So if you're an elderly male or female with low levels of hormones and you're starting to develop dementia, you need to have your hormones looked at because they regulate all these things and to document it up the Kazoo or was, what about the interpretation? That's, that's also where your unconventional kariah standard means. We've, I've looked at it from uh, a shift, you know, hormone x, whatever it is, has a range of 10 to 90 so you go to your doctor and you get the blood tests and it's 15 and you've got all the symptoms as though you're at below 10 and the doctor says you shouldn't be having any symptoms because you're within that range that we called the reference range. But it turns out that not all of us are identical genetically and function very well at that specific level of 15.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       So what we do is we bring people up to what's called the median 10 on the bottom 90 on the top, yet it together you get a hundred you divided by two and that's the statistical median. So we move people from that 15 all the way up towards that 50 and some people hit 20 and say, Geez, I feel better. 25 29. And then there's a population who have had the greatest amount of head trauma, traumatic brain injury where they need to go up between 50 and 75% and we still keep everybody within the normal physiological range as predict them by a traditional medicine, classical medicine. And that's where we get the benefits. And that's the reason why, um, a lot of these guys have had a missed opportunity by their primary care doc to improve them is because they are still functioning under the old paradigm, which in 1975 to major biostatisticians came out with these two books that are like eight pounds each.

Speaker 4:          01:09:45       And all they talked about is how all this science, all this chemistry that we do for people that it doesn't apply to you. And I, it applied to the people that were part of that study to set the standard range or the reference range because I wasn't part of that group. So my, what's normal for me wasn't part of that. So what the guy said was the two guys said was what's best is to develop your own reference range based on your body. And he should do the same as I've been doing over the past 60 years. So a guy comes in and he's an 11 and they tell him what he's normal in this hypothetical situation, he still has, has all these symptoms, right? So what we do in a provocative to stossel testing and the guy and I also do it in females, is we test the theory out, okay, if it is the case, I'm going to give you a shot.

Speaker 4:          01:10:36       What did you say you felt like for 60 hours since Cinderella? Cinderella. I got three daughters, so I know, I know that Disney well, okay, fine. So he received his injection and he drove on the full of five talk to Becky for an hour and she told me the story, like she was in amazement that it goes that guy. Yeah, totally. He didn't think it was me. That was good. So, but anyway, he sends back a, what happens is after they get their injection, they send back five days later, this questionnaire that says how well they did. And in big letters in the area, that's for comments, he says, I felt Cinderella

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       after the ball and for 60 hours he was just cruising. And we're using physiological dosing of testosterone. I don't believe in, you know, everybody who comes to the office is not abiding bodybuilder. So we give physiological dosing because if you give it more consistently, they get a better response. So he was given 60 milligrams of a blended testosterone, had a phenomenal, you had a good response, you could respond. But the crazy thing is we're talking about from 2014 we're in 2017 almost 2018 now, where, I mean we're less than four years and all this change has happened. Correct. That's what's amazing that you've started the warrior Angels Foundation, that you have helped so many soldiers since then that you've gotten the word out through your foundation. We're dealing with a very short amount of time and so many people have been helped to this amazing extent.

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       Correct. And you know we asked people how'd they hear about us and thank God that we started back in two 14 on your show. The first one, so many people have commented to me, look at, if you see Joe would just thank them for us. We have lists and lists of people who would like to thank you for the fact that you believed in what I was doing enough to, to have us on the show the first time back in 2014 separate Korean man and people seek, keep hearing it for the first time like I ceased to. It never ceases to amaze me every week I get just a ton of mail from people who heard it for the first time that like I didn't, I didn't think there was any solution out there, man. Well, I think this is a really good time to do this.

Speaker 5:          01:12:46       Again, this is one of the reasons why I was excited about this because the podcast has grown exponentially since then. It's so, it's much, much, the, the audience is much larger now. So I think we're going to be able to affect and help a lot more people. Um, so for people that are interested, people that want to find out more information and then they want to try to help themselves, what's the best steps? Well, so we set up the organization. We had such a outpouring because of all the media, like it was an overwhelming, uh, almost to get to everybody. So basically what we do now is we grant a millennium health centers so much money and we were helped to subsidize costs like that. So they'll go with our grants to mark's a facility. They'll go there, they'll fill out information, uh, through his website, which is millennium.

Speaker 5:          01:13:33       Let's see, Tbi med, legal.com. That's Tbi Med med, legal.com. They'll fill out a new patient information packet, put in all their information there. Then they can be seen that way. And let me tell you this about mark. Every time I go to visit him for a doctor's visit, he won't let me pay. He may make pay for other soldiers. That's what he does. He picks patients out and he goes, well, let's pick some guys out. You're gonna pay for them. And that's how he does it. And You have, they're appreciative. Absolutely. What you do as beautiful are the corporation, our corporation, Millennium Health Centers, inks, uh, has a fund.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       And what it does is it underwrites a portion of the veterans. And then warrior Angel Foundation underwrites another portion of it. So, you know, revenue that we get from the, um, some of the products you sell and so forth goes to help, uh, pay for it. People have to pay for it, Joe. But we found that they need to have some skin in the game. Yep. You know what I mean? That that enables us to be met halfway. So again, we've subsidized the rate where we've made it. It's a form, like it's affordable period. But now it's really affordable. Uh, cause the insurance not taken for a whole host of different reasons, but so we've made it that way. And so now like we used to handle every case individually, the warrior Angels Foundation and, and fund them and, and it was just a hipaa mess and, and everything else. So now we fund them directly and I've worked to subsidize these rates and make it affordable so we can help more people get treatment and

Speaker 2:          01:15:05       talk about that, about having skin in the game and how important that is just psychologically for people. It seems like if you give people things for free, they just don't appreciate it as much as you can make them work for it. It's, it's unfortunate because there's a lot of people that really will work hard for something. They just don't have the financial means. But there's so many that that applies to that. If you just give it to them, they don't appreciate it. It's too easy. It comes too easy.

Speaker 3:          01:15:29       Yeah. Well fortunately very few people have responded that way. The vets have been really good. They've heard about us from either your show or from one of the shows or from their colleagues who are in the program and they see how well it is. And they look at the how dismal their life is, right? And they have a choice. Make a choice. You want to live the life that Andrew had in the past or the enjoyment and the love of life that he has now. And how could someone like me donate? Oh, it's on our website. Waf, tbi.org. It's a, we're a five zero one c three, so it's tax deductible and you can go in there on top right is the uh, donate. Um, we have a film coming out called quiet explosions, uh, top. There you go. That uh, that's our trailer right there. Uh, so we've got an emmy award winning director. Here it is. Can you play that Jamie? Go full screen.

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       The average of glass, we have travels at 163 miles per hour. It says that's a great pick. You got to see this video folks and people that are just listening to the podcast. You've got to see the impact of these blasts.

Speaker 6:          01:16:44       Explosive. So any type of injury that we needed to get into a place that was denied for whatever reason, be it a door or whatever, I was the guy who would place those charges to get us in. You're not the person that you used to be. I can't remember things home. I don't

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       know where I'm at. Five years. I've driven that route everyday. All of a sudden look up. You don't know where you're at.

Speaker 6:          01:17:18       I said to myself, you know, this is going to go one of two ways. I continue on this path and it's going to kill me. Or I can make a decision to quit blaming my circumstance and decide to act.

Speaker 3:          01:17:30       And it says in 2014 when you met Mark Gordon, hormone deficiency and suicide are

Speaker 7:          01:17:36       connected

Speaker 8:          01:17:51       for the people listening to something you need to see. It's just a lot of the text on the page talking about the benefits of this and how much it's helped. Andrew and what does the name of this video, Jamie? So people get

Speaker 3:          01:18:04       quiet explosions and we just started production this month, right mark? Yeah, correct. This month. And so, uh, if you want to donate to that, you can donate there. That'll also be a tax deductible in this is a donation three that you guys are doing. And what do you mean? We're going to do three, uh, three different stories. All people through the foundation. So we have two other crew, incredible stories. And then the top minds in a, in science, in neuroendocrinology and neuroscience neuropathology are talking about traumatic brain injury and the protocol. So it's kind of a concussion, you know what I mean? Identified a problem. We're identifying a solution. So not only are we bringing out for the first time ever, you know, what is the real underlying condition behind traumatic brain injury. Here's a solution, here's all the science behind it, here's the specialists in their field confirming, you know, what the literature has been saying. And so we hope to bring that out in 2019. And what are you going to do with it when you bring it out? We're just disseminate the information. Are you going to release it online? You're going to release it in movie theaters? Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:19:10       Yeah. All of that. All of that. As many places you can. Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm not sure how it's gonna all be distributed. The goal right now is to disseminate the information. That's it. As we have more potential individuals who are suffering, listening to this, uh, we've been training doctors, we've been getting through multiple avenues through the military, through the different, uh, divisions. Um, getting them on board, supporting US Navy Seal Foundation has supported us. Um, that's all we're trying to do and we've got enough ground swell in our population to justify it. As Andrew has said, multiple times, it's reproducible, predictable,

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       and there's something that I want to impart here. There's a stigma with men in particular in this country when it comes to hormones and replacing hormones. Um, they're very embarrassed by it. They don't like it. It disturbs them. Um, and they start to think of it as cheating or they start to think of it as steroids. They look at it in an illogical way and that illogical ways connected to, I think in my opinion, the stigmas in our culture that are attached to performance enhancing drugs, like for cheating in sports in the Olympics. And you always hear about them in this sort of negative way. So there's a lot of guys that they shy away. I've talked to many friends who are very smart and they, they talked to me about testosterone. I'm like, dude, I've been on testosterone for 10 years and make it changes your life.

Speaker 2:          01:20:37       It changes, it changes the way you function. I'm 50 years old, my body functions like it did when I was 30 and that's a fact. It really does. And I pushed that motherfucker all the time. So I'm not, I'm not telling you this from just a theoretical standpoint. I'm talking about from the physical action perspective. And I tell this to people and you see it go in one ear and out the other. I don't want to take any testosterone. I don't want to, I don't want to go to a doctor that's gonna get me human growth hormone. I don't want to look at my hormone levels and like, but you're, you're depressed and you're tired all the time and you're, you're trying all these different things. You're taking Zoloft, you're getting magnet therapy. I know people who've gotten ketamine shots and all these different things to try to cure depression. I'm like, why don't you look at your fucking hormones, man?

Speaker 4:          01:21:24       Yeah. They can look at, it doesn't mandate that they have to take it, but they should know. They should know. Absolutely. But what mark's talking about is your physiological optimal level. Right? And so that hypothetical scenario that he gave earlier, if you're out at an 11 you know what I mean? And you're just once you know, point above normal. Well guess what? That's not normal. You know what I mean? You're on the perceived lower end. So he has a completely different sliding scale to measure that. But to me it would like be taken objective analysis and just get a snapshot of where that's at and like maybe to see what it would be like to push it up a little bit and see if life improved. Not, it's super physiological, physiological based on you in normal healthy levels. Yeah, you might, you might find out that, hey man, I went up, you know, 10 points and I'm great, or you had to push it really high.

Speaker 4:          01:22:11       You're different, you know, different strokes for different folks, but I'm trying to figure out is why would someone rather take a psychotropic medication than fixing what God has given our body to manufacture that because of trauma, because of genetics or whatever. You're not producing it at the level. And another fallacy for me, a fallacy is that as we get older, it's acceptable to have lower and lower levels of hormones. Well, how about this? The reason why they're getting lower and lower is because of the shitty food you're eating. The fact that you had 60 years of traumatic brain injury, which have interrupted the brain's ability to regulate homeostasis, to regulate your hormone production. That's the reason why the levels are lower. So bringing it back to 25 to 35 years of age, which has been the dictum in our office for the past 27 years has been key.

Speaker 2:          01:23:01       Yeah. One of the things that jumped my testosterone up a bunch is cutting out processed carbohydrates. All the refined carbohydrates. It just jumped it like 50% it was like it doubled it and I was like, this is insane. Right? So it tells you how important the biochemistry is of the buddy of the body to regulate other aspects of it. Yeah, and the Diet and exercise and sleep and all these different factors. But when I saw that my, my testosterone, it bumped up and then ultimately doubled. I, I was so confused as to why it took me so long to figure this out, that eating pasta and bread and pizza and all the bullshit was having an effect not just on like body fat, but it's having an effect on your whole body being able to process all of these chemicals. You got to think of yourself as a machine and people don't like to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       But think of your body as a machine. If you have a machine or an engine or any, or can think of it as a vehicle, you're, you've got to have, yeah, you need spark plugs. You need cooling, you need gasoline, you need all these different factors and if you don't have the proper amount of engine oil, if you don't have the spark plugs aren't working right, the vehicle is not going to work right. Your body is far more complex than a car, but similar in that respect. The an analogy I like car analogies. Uh, you've got a brand new porsche nine 11 carrera with four flat tires. Choose one of them to fill up and drive. You're not going to be able to before cardinal harm hormones of our body and I see colleagues of mine who only focus in on one hormone. How are you going to be able to have a nice level ride if you don't look at all for the key hormones and the also the insanely complex way that all these different nutrient levels and hormone levels interact with each other and that they're all a part of this incredible system that takes forever to just scratch the surface of understanding.

Speaker 2:          01:25:01       I mean I read a lot, I've just scratched the surface of understanding what's going on and I'm not sure I understand it. It is so complex, but when you see the results, you know that at least you're down the right pathway. It's a symphony, you know, that's what they always say it's a symphony. But how better did you feel, you know, after cutting out those things and your testosterone better, right? Like almost immediately like the big one was the not needing a nap. Yeah. You know, like in the middle of the day I just assumed that I would get up, I would eat breakfast. Then around three I'd be like, fuck, I need to crash. It's testosterone deficiency. Three o'clock does that. And then there's also the insulin pump right from the shitty process foods and carbohydrates. I came off all protocols that 2017 for seven months for this year. Cause just because I wanted to see what would happen. One I thought like the brain and body went back to Nerpa miss of environment and the hypothalamus and my pituitary gland would turn back on. But it wasn't the case. We had two labs to followed up. But I had to prove to myself, I guess emotionally, spiritually

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       that I, you know, I could slay that dragon and I could live life without it. But it wasn't, it was no by no means of the imagination optimized. You know what I mean? And then when I went back on it, man, like my body composition changed again and I noticed increased energy and I thought I was doing well, but I was like, life is better. I'm a better person when this is optimized. And so, you know, I've proven to myself that I can do it without it, but life is not better. I mean we use of it. We might be looking at some time in the near future where they can do something genetically where they can alter the way your pituitary gland functions are. Some of the different things with Crispr, with many of these genetic manipulation tools that they're working on right now. But as of right now, that's not the case. No, you have to get tested and then replenish back to physiological levels. All the hormones, not a select all of them actually just do one. You can mess up the whole, the whole thing. Right. Is there a network of doctors that you've trained that you trust their work that you can recommend? Is there a way that people, so they don't have to travel to California to meet you? Right.

Speaker 4:          01:27:10       Uh, on the website, um, there's uh, give that website out again, a Tbi Med, legal tb, I m e d l e g a l. Dot com has, uh, under Tbi network and training. It has a list of doctors. We've trained doctors in Spain, United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia. I'm going to Southeast Asia to train a group, uh, in Cambodia and Vietnam for a project, which is to establish centers in Southeast Asia because there's a lot of retired vets there. Pull it up again, Jamie. A lot of retired vets to set up centers so they can offer treatment.

Speaker 5:          01:27:53       And if you look at the website, it's listed all in alphabetical order. We have California, there's Arizona there, Colorado, Florida, there's,

Speaker 4:          01:28:01       my name's on it are people who are in the process of getting their certification. So there's a four hour exam they have to take and pass it with the least 70% and then present two cases showing they have the ability to uh, utilize the information.

Speaker 5:          01:28:16       So there's doctors available in many, many states and that's been our goal to make this network of doctors where you can reach people at scale in the same way like train trainers are trained doctors and that's what we're working on with the government right now. What's incredible is it how much you've accomplished in such a short period of time? That's what's really incredible. Obsessed. Yes. It driven, totally driven better. Uh, there's nothing wrong in obsessed. I'm obsessed with everything. People have a hard time with that word. They think it's like it's gotten away from them. Passionate. Passionate is good. I liked that as we're taking the action, but like for the right reasons and like opportunities just continues to present itself. I think that's just the byproduct of a right way of doing things. You know what I mean? Like, Hey, let's be proactive. Let's go there.

Speaker 5:          01:29:01       Let's make things happen. Yeah, let's go do it. He said to me in the beginning, he said, we're going to be doing the right things for the right reason. And what'll happen is things will shake out of the trees and land in front of us. And that's what basically has been happening. We just, you know, money. It's not the issue. Just get the work done in the response and the reaction of our vets. Well, the reaction, the response has been incredible as far as like what I've heard and what, what's come to me about it. And uh, hopefully we're shaking that fucking Shit, man. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29:32       Dude, because of this show, because of you, like this information has been widely disseminated man. And uh, you helped promote our book and give us a blurb for that. So thank you for that. A tales from the blast factory, uh, supports what we're doing. Uh, that comes out next month if anybody's interested in, in that, matter of fact, we did a thing on Amazon, Joe, or they get it for 99 cents. So we want people to get that book. Wow. Beautiful. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       Beautiful. All right. So, uh, any closing thoughts that we need to get out there, if these people, then we covered it all. I think we covered it all. Um, you know, my last closing statement is, thank you so much. Listen, thank you. I'm, I'm, I'm forever in your debt and I think that what you guys are both doing is incredible and I'm honored that I could play a small part in getting this out there. It's just, it means, it means everything. Thank you. Thank you for the butter. My heart. All right, fuckers. That's it for the day. We'll see you tomorrow, but by donate.
