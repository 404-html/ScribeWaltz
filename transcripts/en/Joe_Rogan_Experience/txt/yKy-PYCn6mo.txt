Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Dib. Dib, Dib, Dib, Dib, Dib. Dumb. What's up man, thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. And thanks for introducing me to your dog. Cause I, I have to tell you that that video of you grabbing that raccoon and chucking it down the stairs was easily one of the most gangster things I've ever seen. He lets you do. Is this it? I had to put a little disclaimer up here so that you know the animal rights folks wouldn't get pissed off. Uh Yeah. Well that's you're going to, they're going to get pissed off anyway. So right now I hear him crying cause there's no audio on the cameras but he's like just getting mauled by this thing and you just picked it up and fucking chucked it like gangster dude. I mean you didn't just push it away. You picked it up over your head, went back behind the head like you're throwing a medicine ball.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       Cause another angle. Yeah. This is the best tackle over the back of the head and show boom bang. We're talking to Kevin Rose, the founder of dig. I got to say though, it was a little liquid courage. I'd had a couple of glasses of wine and number two, my intention was to go down there and just kick it. Right. But it was on top of my dog so it'd be punting my dog at the same time. It was tangled. Who's tangled? So I mean, you know, then I grabbed it and it's, it's greasy and kind of bristly. Ooh, so, but you know, whatever, it's kind of, it's one, it's your baby. I know it sounds weird to say what the dog, but it's just like I thought he was dying. He was getting, he was howling like he was getting shredded. But with this clause, you know, so I'm thinking my dog is being killed.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       Did you think it was a coyote? No. You know, we had seen recommends in the backyard before and it was just one of those things where they always just kind of like run away. The second that the lights come on. And this time I don't know what he was, I don't know if he had babies. Actually, there were some other records that we saw with him at the same time, so I dunno man. Those weird sort of a fringe wildlife creatures like raccoons and coyotes to kind of hang around. Cities are so creepy. Yeah. There's a ton in San Francisco. It's just all over the place at night. They just dig through the trash basically. We'll San Francisco, believe it or not, at least the outside edges has a bit of a mountain line problem. I've heard that. Yeah. They've, they did this study recently where they check the digestive tracks of all these mountain lines and they thought you were going to find deer and rabbit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       No, they found mostly pets. Yeah. It's like 50% cats and dogs is what they found. You don't want to tangle with a mountain lion. That's crazy. Well, it's just weird that they've chosen to exist in the periphery of the cities and sort of feed on these, these pets house animals. Yeah. It's too bad. Yeah. It's not normal though that a raccoon attacks a dog like that, right? Yeah. They typically just take off that. That's been our experience with them. And then I proceeded to go on Amazon and buy a trap. Uh, and so then I was able to trap what a few days later and it was evil. I mean like I went down there just to check out the trap and I saw it from above and when I got down there it was just

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       hissing and trying to scratch the cage at me. And I mean they're not the friendly ones that you see on youtube. Like there's some that are like kind of domesticated where they, the people feed them and then they come and you can pet them and whatnot. These, these wild ones or, or just like the, I will cut your throat kind of animals. I had a feral cat for awhile and I love tats but feral cats, it is a completely different experience. Like mine was a kitten. It was a little baby will, I mean it was really young, like maybe three months old at the most and you couldn't get anywhere near it. He'd go near. Anyone would run up the side of the wall, tear apart the curtains shit away from you. Just get rid of it or no, I kept it. I um, I locked myself in a bedroom with it for a couple days, aiming it, break it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:46       It's not even that I had a break it, I just had to get it used to me it was, it was a real weird experience. My friend Lanie, she and her boyfriend lived in this apartment in west Hollywood, like us, like west La, like Santa Monica area, and there's these feral cats that had had babies underneath the apartment building. And so they're like, oh my God, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? All right, we have to trap them. And so she knew that I already had two cats. So she's like, do you want a cat? And I was like, all right, fuck it. Give me a cat. Yeah. And if you give those to the animal shelter, they'll just terminate him. I tell him he, that's too bad. Well, it was, it was so hard to get used to this thing but with hiss at you.

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       But when you pick it up it would go, it would like be the loudest pervs and he's so happy that someone was touching it, but then you put it down just for a second and be like, it would run away again. It took forever and like it took, it took years before it would let anyone else get even close to it, like hiding under furniture and things like that. It would hiss at you and run away from you. I was the only one that could touch it. And even me, I had a little, I go, hey dude, it's me. You know me, right? Yeah, we're cool and I get close to him, but he would swing at Ya. He'd definitely bite you. About a month ago I was looking up how to break a horse. I just thought that because it kind of a fun thing. Why? Why not?

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       They would be amazing. The bond he would have. I know they'll kick your ass though. That'd be fun though. Yeah. I think good like weekend project. No, get off the computer. I could break a horse. I know a bunch of people that have gotten hurt from horses. They're falling off horses and broken arms and legs and stuff. It's just, I know a dude got kicked by a horse that can be death. Oh yeah. They kill like all kinds of animals. Like dogs barking dogs. They kick them in the dump. That's it. Over. Yeah. I mean, you're getting hit by a telephone pole. This is fucking, things are giant. I mean, it's an animal that can take a 200 pound man and run with it on its back for hours. Right. Just there's raw power there. I was in Montreal and there's this amazing restaurant called Joe beef and um, they serve horse there and it's one of those places where, um, I know the owners through Anthony Bordain.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       He introduced me to them and so they said, just let us cook for you. And so we're like, okay, go ahead man. He goes, fuck, fuck them in and you'd just let us cook for course three ways. Will they, that was just one of the things they brought over. We didn't know that what it was until it like they set it down and they're like, this is horse tar tar. And we're like, wait, wait a minute. What raw horse. I've had lamb tar tar one time when I was in Dubai. That was a little funky. It's very fatty. And so it's a, it's a lot of like, um, film on your mouth after you get done eating it, you know, like the roof of your mouth. Kind of like a little filming, not, not fun. Well, I'm a fan of lamb until I found out what Lam is.

Speaker 2:          00:06:36       That it's, it's baby sheep. That's what it is. You think of cheap though too, right? No, that's mutton. Oh, interesting. Yeah. It's like veal is, it's like the feel of the mutton world. Yeah. Um, and I, I went, oh, babies will really young. Immature. Hmm. Yeah. That's too bad. It is too bad. It is tasty. It's the most delicious. Well that's why when you get lamb chops, it's a very small boat. Interesting. Yeah. We would just assume, right. That's too bad. You just kind of tainted me forever. Bombed it. Well, it's really easy for you to digest. For some reason lamb is a much more digestible meat protein wise like for it's very good for you. Hmm. A lot of people feel like it's a more high quality meat, closer to like a a wild game than say like cows and you know, things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:07:35       How do they measure that? It's a good question. They, I know they can measure protein content somehow and they know that like some animals, like I think moose as like the highest protein content like per gram. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it's also, that's probably based on how lean it is too, because you would assume that it right down it's piece of Moose would be far less fat than an eight ounce piece of domestic beef. Right. So that's probably how they measure it. Crazy. Well it looks different. You know like lamb looks different than beef when you look at it as like a redder sort of a, unless it's grass fed beef, grass fed beef. Pretty Rad. Have you tried to bear? Yes. See I, that's when I haven't tried it. But I've been curious. I've heard it's pretty oily though. Uh, no it's not. Oh sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:08:18       No, I'm, well it really depends on how you prepare it in the field and uh, what you do with it. But bear sausage is delicious and bear backstraps the Loin is really good grilled, but bear you have to be really careful because uh, you can get tricky gnosis a lot of bears up tricky analysis so you have to make sure it's cooked to 165 degrees. Oh, interesting. Yeah. It's like, um, it's actually so there's no medium rare bear. No, no, you're going, the only way you could ever do that is if you got tested first. You could do that. Like you'd send it to a lab, like you take the bear tongue and you send it out to a lab and they test it. Or is that a, I think you might have to actually send the actual meat itself or a piece of meat, but if it has trick analysis is throughout his whole body.

Speaker 2:          00:09:02       Is it tough? No. Oh, interesting. There's weird men, their bodies are very mushy. You, you would think of their bodies like like an elk or a deer is a very strong like they're very muscular like a horse is right, but a bear is almost like gushy. Like when they die and when you pick them up they like a fat person. It's weird. Well they hibernate and they have those big fat stores. I guess that makes sense. But they have what you would, the way you would describe it, like they have a soft body but the, the meat is very good. Yeah. It's like a, it's the way I describe is like a pig fucked a deer. That's a bear. Tastes like really cause I like pig. Yeah. You would like it to dear. If I had some men, I'm having some delivered on Thursday. How long are you going to be in town for me and I take off tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          00:09:51       Next time I'll bring you some a bear sausage and I'll have it frozen for you that you'd take it back. It's really good. And it's all, it's, it's also one of those animals were my friend Steve Rinella calls them charismatic megafauna. Or if you say you eat bear, there's a bunch of people that have this, oh, this like knee jerk. Right. But it's one of those game animals where it's actually imperative that people hunt them because they don't have any natural predators. So if they don't get hunted, if someone doesn't control the population, they decimate the moose and the deer because they eat all the Fonz. Interesting. They eat, uh, all the ground nesting birds. Then they just, and then also eat each other. So I, I have a friend that collects butterflies, uh, my friend's wife and apparently there are places in the world where the butterflies are a serious problem.

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       Like they overtake and eat crops and like decimate everything. Wow. And that these beautiful like, you know, six, seven inch butterflies, but she sources them from there where they actually have to kill them, otherwise it's going to ruin the whole environment. Wow. I didn't know. Collects the dead ones. Dead ones. Yeah. So she has him like, you know, up on the wall kind of in one of those those cases so you can see them and when you first walk in you're like, okay asshole. Like you know, cause there's like all these beautiful butterflies all over the place. But uh, yeah apparently that's, that's the deal is you have to just source them. Well those really, Really Cool Butterfly Butterfly Pavilion in Denver is really awesome. And it's a, you go there and um, when you go inside of it, they have all these mres everywhere and the entire place is just filled with butterflies.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       San Francisco has one of those as well. Oh that's cool. Yeah. And the lands on your head and then they're all around you and when you leave you, they have to like dust you off cause there's so many butterflies on you, but they die while you're there. I mean there's shelf life or their, their life is very short, right? So they, they die constantly. Like you find them dead all throughout the place. Not that anybody killed them. They just die of old age. Like we watched a couple of them just sit down on a leaf and all of a sudden they like, that's it. We're good. Wow. You're only good. I mean, I don't know. How long has the butterfly live? It's okay. Does it say how long a butterfly lives? Sure. It's a super zen moments. Yes. I say a butterfly lives a week. Yeah, I think a week sounds about right.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       It's probably a little last week. I think so I'm looking, you say a week, but I'd say a little less than that. There's so amazing looking. It's such a strange thing that nature can create all of these beautiful designs and shapes and they'll just different forms of life, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Especially in bug forum, you know, bugs are some of the most were, I think we entirely take bugs for granted this, the idea of them, they're so common. What does it say? A month. Oh, they will. They last a month. Interest. Have you done any of that bug protein powder? Yes. I haven't done the cricket stuff. Tim Ferriss has entail. Do you like that? Um, I like bugs. I mean, I really think that's probably because of my time on fear factor. I got super used to people eating bugs, but I liked the idea of it because it is like probably one of the most ethical, um, proteins.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       Like it's the easiest to source. It needs very little like land and ground and for whatever reason, even vegans, most vegans don't have a problem with you eating bugs. Like most vegans will slap a mosquito, right. You know, they're not going to let some mosquito just vampire off right there. We'll kill a mosquito. So we have these, this hierarchy of life. You know, plant life is at the lowest. You're allowed to kill and eat plants and then it gets up to weird animals like bear. We've heard of fruitarians. Those are even more extreme than just the general plants. They only eat fallen fruit. Yeah. I had an aunt that was a fruitarian. Oh God, that's scary. She was crazy. Was she in bad shape? Because they don't get a lot of essential stuff. We haven't talked in a long, long time, but she was, she was crazy when I was a little kid.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       She was a vegetarian when I was, um, I think I was like seven, seven or eight and it was, she only fallen fruit like fruit that has fallen off the tree, cause extreme version of that. I think she probably picked it. I didn't, I didn't really know her very well and she wasn't very close even to our own children. She'd have her on the crazy, I don't think she'd be into it. And she's probably, I don't even know if she's around anymore. She's probably in her late sixties at this point. Yeah. Yeah. But she was, she was a nutty hippie from, you know, the 60s had some kids and my cousins just lost her fucking mind. Yeah. Rotarians man. Yeah, she was deep in the, the world of plants, but she had, she wasn't healthy like mentally or physically, so it wasn't like someone that would go, wow, maybe that's the way to go.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       It was like, oh look at this crazy bitch. You know, like, cause she didn't even like her kids. Like she didn't have a good relationship with her own children. It's like, how am I going to take you seriously about fucking fruit, right? How will you be nice to people? Crazy bitch. No, I mean there's certain, I think we've all looked at like vegetarians had been like seeing someone really healthy and thought, wow, you're glowing. Yeah. Like I would also like to glow. Like yeah, I could see myself doing that, but the, the fruit stuffs a little too far. Well, before I started hunting, I had two thoughts in mind. One, this was going to turn me into a Vegan or to become a hunter. So those are the two things that I went into it with. I, I, I think there's a lot of health benefits to eating a lot of vegetables.

Speaker 2:          00:15:06       I think everybody agrees. Sure. 100% it's, this is the real issue is it becomes sort of a weird religion. It becomes almost like a, an ideology, like a cult. Like it can't, there's no variables. It's like eating animals is evil and animals are sentient beings in this despite what they do to each other, despite the fact that like I had a friend who's a Vegan, we had this conversation and I said, so no animal should be killed ever. He's like, no. Okay, okay. I have two words for you. Wild pigs. What do you do? Yeah. And he's like, well, they have to be controlled somehow. I go, how the fuck are you going to do that? You have hundreds of millions of acres and you have wild pigs. The amount of wild pigs in this country is staggering. Staggering. It's exploding. And there's [inaudible], there's a highway that they opened up in Texas and they had built this highway and then they opened it up one night and then that one night they opened, they had like 40 car accidents with pigs.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       That's crazy. Oh, Texas is out of feathers as Rana pigs. You can get his pets. Pigs are taken over. Nanopay have using seen the nano pink. Oh, tiny pet pigs. They're like the size of a small toy poodle. But then they always have those like didn't, I couldn't fuck, I ain't been around for awhile. But they're becoming very popular. Especially here in la. I can't believe you don't. You haven't seen them in la? He'll walk them like dogs. You would think that I would like, because I live out here that I would understand this place, but my interaction with La is going to the comedy store and the Improv going to the comedy clubs, going to where I buy food, going to my neighborhood and being with my friends and going to the gym, like whatever, wherever I work out. That was pretty. Do you enjoy the city then? Or, I think there's too many people here. Yeah. I just think, oh look at these little cute little fucker. They're cute little bastards. Look at that little ball. But that's a baby though. I mean that's a baby naming a question. Let's say you get them though. Wow. And how big do they get when they're full grown? I think just like toy poodle size.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       Great pets. Apparently. They're really smart. Look at they look guitars. Well, I don't think that's real. They entertain you apparently. And it makes for them. What a little cutie. They're very cute. But again, it's like there's a big goddamn difference between a domesticated pig that you raise yourself. That becomes like a pet and a wild pig. I'll, you're fucking scary. We were in, no, this ranch, this tone ranch, we were hunting wild pigs were walking down this road and it was the first time I had any contact with them. I didn't see them. I heard them. And they were in this tall grass and they were maybe like 20 yards from us and they were fighting. So we're walking down this row were like tip toeing down this road and we here and I'm like, this is like some Lord of the rings. Shit man. They have like the full tusks and everything. So these are Moore's basically.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       Well that's where it's weird. See a pig is something called sue Scrofani. I think that's how you say it. And that genus is there. They're all the same thing. They're like dogs, so they could breed with each other and they're the same animal, which means is, this is a weird thing about pigs. If you take a domestic pig, regular pig, pink pig, and you leave them out in the wild, they transform into that really well. They grow tusks, they grow tusks, their nose, their nose extends, their body for gets thicker and more dense and it happens really quickly. I believe that transformation starts to take place within six weeks. So it was in within six weeks of being wild and out in the wild, having to fend for itself, not having food given to it. It's body starts to transform. It's a very strange animal.

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       Yeah. Do they know how to fend for themselves and eat and all of that? Like I think instincts take over. They get desperado mean whatever. Instincts are still left in the genes. The fasting and ketosis brings it out of them with, yeah, well they made a lot of carbs I think. Right? That's what, but they'll eat everything. I mean, that's the thing about, again, ground nesting birds get decimated. Everything in front of them. I mean, and for agriculture, for places where they have farms, they're absolutely devastating. It costs millions and millions of dollars worth of damage. But the, the idea that you can leave all animals alone like, well you won't be able to go outside, you'll have a very dangerous environment. Right. Like the mountain lion issues, a big issue in California, you know, and right now it's pretty much under control. Kinder, there's good, there's good things to it too though.

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       Like one of the good things to it is that we don't have deer ticks. We don't have a lot of ticks out here like they do on the east coast because the east coast doesn't have mountain lions. Right. So because of that, and they don't have nearly as many coyotes and see coyotes, kimberly take out a full sized deer, they can really, they fuck up the Fonz and they kill a lot of the babies, but they can't relate to the big deer's can kind of fend off a coyote, but they can't fend off I'm outline. Gotcha. And Mountain Lions, Jack. So many deer that we don't have problems with. Like lyme disease out here. Like lyme disease is a huge problem. I've had coast, I had a friend that got it here a couple of years ago out here to fun. No, east coast. East Coast. Yeah. He's coast. It's real bad.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       They were, they, there was some estimate that there was something in like the Hudson valley where they did a test of all these different ticks and some ungodly percentage had lyme disease. Yeah. More than 50% of the ticks had lyme disease, which is terrifying. Yeah. Cause that'll socks. It's, and it's what's fucking devastating to your immune system. It really wrecks your body and some people get it and they keep it forever. I mean it just fucks with their system forever. Yeah. I had a buddy that had to go on hardcore antibiotics right away. The second you get diagnosed with it and you have to do cycles of those to try and get it out. It's really brutal. Well, I have a friend who got it and he brought his son. His son got it too. And he brought his son to the doctor and it was a shitty doctor. The doctor didn't want to believe that the kid had disease

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       and then all of sudden the kid's face went palsy. He had bell's palsy where his mouth started drooling and his, his, his lips wouldn't move to that comeback or is that, yes. Hardcore antibiotics. Intravenous antibiotics. And they had to do it for a long time, like a month of hardcore antibiotic. It's brutal. Well it's, it's a scary disease man, because it also was related to, um, there's that more Jerilyn's disease, which for a long time they thought more jealous might be some sort of a psychosomatic disorder where people believe they had like fiber's going out of their skin and they're itching themselves constantly. And they would, they would bring these fibers to doctors to exam and they say, my body's growing these fibers. Weird. Yeah. But it wasn't really going on. What was going on was that the fibers were like carpet fibers and things that were stuck to their skin.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       And so I interviewed this guy who was a more gel and suffer and he was also a doctor. So it was kind of fascinating, um, to get his perspective on it. And He, and he was very frustrated by the way the medical establishment treats us disease because they were treating it like it's like a completely psychological disorder. And he's like, I don't think so. He goes, I think there's a neuro toxicity to this disease. And that one of the things about this disease was a vast majority of the people who hadn't made more jealous also had lyme disease. So what he thinks, and this is, there's not enough people that have it, but he thinks his lyme disease affects your brain. There's some sort of a, of neuro toxicity to this lyme disease when it gets to some people. And the other thing he said, when you get lyme disease, like you have a, a tick that gives you this, this disease and the tick carries it in his body gives to you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       He goes, it's not like it's giving it to you in a syringe and it's a pure form of this disease. It's like you're getting a variety of different pathogens along with that. And the, when he was describing it to me, I was like, oh, this totally makes sense. It's probably just as very small sample size of people who have this problem. But the people haven't, man, they get fucking crazy. Do you go out to the east coast at all then? Do you avoid all the tapes like I go but I'll spray stuff. There's clothing that they can, um, that they've designed for people that are in those areas that you make sure socks up to like the beltline kind of thing. But you can get bit even through socks. It's really pants and, and, um, boot gators and all these different things to make sure that they don't get in the crevices. And, and if you come in contact with an animal that has it, you have to be really careful that makes sure those ticks don't come off and get onto you and you gotta be careful. It's, it's no joke. Yeah, that's not fun. What's so scary? Because it fucks with your immune system and it really, depending upon how bad you get it and who you are and what your makeup is, you know, some people just have a really nasty averse reaction to it. It's a matter of fact, my friend's dad got

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       it from a vaccine. They used to give a vaccine for lyme disease and they don't do it anymore because it could turn into full blown. Wow. That's the stuff you always worry about. Yeah. Well it's one of those things like, you know, it's like the people that get the flu shot every once in a while somebody comes down with a full blown for sure. Yeah, absolutely. Well, that was always the argument about, um, vaccines too. Like people were always saying, you know, there's this always this, this thing like, hey vaccines give people autism vaccines do this. And then there's the other campuses, vaccines are harmless. Well, it's never harmless. He shoot a chemical in your body. It's harmless. The vast majority of the time, it's beneficial the vast majority of the time. But if you're one of those one out of a thousand people, there's not that much comfort in the fact that your brain gets fucking fried because they tried some experimental fucking weird vaccine on.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Do you do any of that stuff? Do you do any of the, uh, flu shots every year? No. No. I don't do flu shots, but I did it this year and I came down with the flu. I got decimated. I'm one of those guys that has a really strong immune system until I don't, and then I'm like out for like a month, you know? Like I'm like, you know, licking my fingers all the time and like you don't need to just feel invincible. Yeah. Like I haven't gotten sick for like 10 months and I don't wash my hands sometimes and it's disgusting. But uh, then I just went down hard this year. Well, there's so many factors, right? It's like health, sleep, diet. I think I was doing too much cold therapy stuff. Cold, terrible. Like Wim Hoff. Stop. Yeah. When I'm off stuff too much. Too much. I was talking to Rhonda Patrick, who you've had on the show before about this and um, you know, just too many stressors cause that's a stressor.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       You know, you have green teas, a stress or you have, turmeric is a stressor. You have exercise as a stressor. And if you're doing that every single day. And I was doing the cold stuff, uh, you know, five, six days a week along with, and not, not talking cryo but like cold ice, cold showers. Um, and then along with exercising and interval training and everything else, cold showers, your northern California, right? Yeah. That's all I'll say is actually in New York. So they were really went to my gym has a freeze. I don't know why, but their showers when he turned to the cold setting, I'm lucky at home. I don't have that. I go to the gym and on the cold setting I put my hands, uh, you know, as I'm washing my hair, uh, under the cold shower and my hands are numb within 45 seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       Like it's really, really cold. Jesus. Yeah. Well New York has some fucking severe cold winter. Yeah. And you get that cold water in the winter. That's real cold water. Oh I love it. People call it to talk about cold water California. It's kind of cold. Right? Let's, he'd go into a glacier river. Yeah. I'm so bummed when I come out here cause I go and I stay at a hotel or something. And the first thing I do when I get in a hotel is on cold setting in the showers to see what we're dealing with. It's all week. Yeah. You know, you have to go do proper cryo if you want to do that. Well it's great after yoga in the winter, like there's, you can actually get pretty cold water here in like January in the, but like

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       after a hot yoga class it feels unbelievably cold. Yeah. And like you can't breathe. It's like a probably more of a reaction even in Cryo. Oh interesting. Was cry was weird cause it's cold as fuck, but it's dry. So get in there and there's something, that's where they talked about the desert. They're like, it's a dry heat. Like you know, it's a dry cryo. Well that's California's heat too in comparison to like praxis. I give you ever been to Houston in July. Oh yeah. Yeah. It's brutal. It's like trying to breathe through. It's like you're getting waterboarded right? Like nonstop. Yeah. It's like a hot fucking wet blanket on your face. But, um, the, the, there's, there's a definitely difference in that cold. That's where you're not getting wet. Like Wim Hof actually prefers ice baths. He thinks the ice baths or better for you and, and, and the way he describes it better for your spirit.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       Hmm. Yeah, I've done the ice pass a few times. That was week 10 for me on his, uh, his course. I went and got 10 bags of ice from the corner store, filled up my bathtub with cold water and then put all 10 bags of ice in there, a submerged myself up to my neck and did that for 15 minutes. Wow. Did you get anything out of it? You know, I will say I am a, I'm a huge believer in just cryo and cold therapy in general in that, um, I would, my mood is elevated. It's more than anything else. It's my mood. Yeah. I find myself, like I'm, I'm generally a really happy guy. Like I, you know, we all have their ups and downs as as it were, but this kind of just raises the bar and additional, I would say like 20%.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       And so you have a higher high, if that makes sense. You know, always gonna stay up pegged up there and be like a whole new person. But it's just different. It's, it's, it's amazing. It's been a game changer for me. And so I've gotten really deep on the research side, different than Rhonda. Rhonda goes the science route. I go into the history. So I've been researching people that have done this for hundreds of years now and their protocols and what they've done. And what have you found? Ah, I'm not ready to release it yet. Dare you teased? No, I've got like, I've been doing a ton of research. I'm either going to put out like a big pdf on it or a little mini ebook or something that'll give away. I don't, I don't know. But, um, you can't give us a like a taste. Well, a good taste would be, uh, let me think here.

Speaker 2:          00:28:56       There's some people in Russia that have done it for a long time, hundreds of years, and I got ahold of their original documents and had them translated so I could figure out what the protocol is to Banja and then for freezing water. That's right. Yeah. Fado or Amelion Inco, like probably the greatest heavyweight UFC or mma rather fighter of all time. He was a pride heavyweight champion, you know, he is, no, that was his thing. He would do the Banya when they beat each other with those eucalyptic branches. Right, right. I've done that ton of time by the private other branches, but I've watched it being done. It's fast. It's cool. It does look cool. I bet it would be refreshing, you know, and get, I mean, they're not hurting each other. No, they just slap you around with some branches and they climb from the hot sauna and the climate to the water. But when I always thought of it was just like something that makes you feel a little bit better. But when you read and to Rhonda

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       and her research on Sauna and 40% less mortality across the board from all factors, whether it's cancer, disease, heart attack, all these different things, you're like, what percent drop in mortality? Like that's incredible there. And then she ducks about the actual physical measurable responses to Sauna to extreme heat, heat shock proteins, and then also cold shock proteins. You realize like, oh, there's some something really going on here. Yeah, absolutely. And you could feel it after a couple of weeks for me, my friend, I've had friends do one and they're like, I didn't, I, it's too cold. I can't do this. And I'm like, you don't understand. It's not about just that one time, I don't know about for you, but it was about week two to week three, we're all of a sudden I just woke up and I'm like, wait a second, I feel like I'm 16 again.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       Or you know, just like a little bit. My mood was just crazy. Good. Well, no, what does she call it? North northern epinephrine, norepinephrine, norepinephrine. It's a weird word, nor epinephrin nor [inaudible] nor epinephrin norepinephrine. Yeah. That stuff, that feeling that you get, it's very tangible. It's like a drug. It's almost like [inaudible] like getting a little, just a tiny taste of pot. Just a little, just a little text. Hi. I brought that up in our podcast that I did with her. It was, it's like, it's like you're at a concert and you have like a little hitter and then you're like, whoa. Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It does. It makes the sun feel better. It just, it's great. And, and also for aches and pains and you know, for someone who, who trains a lot the measurable effect that they found as far as like reducing the inflammatory markers in the blood, you can feel that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       You can absolutely feel the response to that when you do it like a week or two in a row. Yeah, that's right. Um, so do you know that cold therapy used to be, um, like it was used as a treatment for insanity? Did you know that back in the day? So van Gogh, when he cut his ear off and they put them in the insane asylum, um, they've forced him to do two weekly, two hour long sessions of cold therapy. And he writes about it. This is a little teaser of some of this stuff research I've been doing. He writes about it in his letters to friends and so his letters are documented online and you can find the Vango letters. And then I've dug into all of his letters and found any mention of cold therapy and what it's done to his mood. It's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       And what was he saying? He was just saying that, yeah, I mean you could look it up. He was just saying that he was a big believer and he's feeling so much better. And then, and then I found pictures of the tub that they used to use. So what they would do is he would lay down in a bathtub and they would put this like wood, um, cover over the top, but just with your head's sticking out. So almost like a guillotine kind of thing. It's a gay teen was the one where they chop your head off getting okay. And so they have his head sticking out and then they would just pour ice cold water through the tub if for two hours, twice a week. Yeah, it's a, you can't do anything. You're stuck them.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       And they would do this to treat insanity and it worked. And then of course drugs came along and everything else. And then all of this just gets forgotten. Um, but that's one example. Another one is I found some monks out, uh, in Japan that study this, um, this form of meditation and Buddhism that where they sit underneath, I'm waterfalls, the waterfalls, and they meditate and I found their chance and all of that that go along with that. So that's something I'm going to put in this document as well. So you know, Hixon Gracie is, it sounds familiar. Hicks and Gracie is the grappler Gracie. Yes. He's hoists. Gracie is the guy won the original UFC, but he had his brother, his brother Hixon as almost like a mythical creature in the world of martial arts because he's universally hailed as the greatest Jujitsu fighter of all time.

Speaker 2:          00:33:28       Okay. Universally by, this is the guy they call it the Michael Jordan of Jujitsu. Jujitsu is one of those things where there's so many good guys. It's so hard to figure out who's the best. Like this guy might be that guy and the next year that guy can beat this guy, but this is Hickson. He's also a legit Yogi, like you practices yoga on a regular basis. This guy, he, he's amazing and you know he's, he's actually been on the podcast too and I had to check to talk to him. That's the buffets. Yoga was very buff, especially when he was young. Well, he was a mixed martial arts champion, a Brazilian Jujitsu champion, but he was also the champion. He was in that movie, the Hulk. He was, the guy was teaching Ed Norton how to control his, his, his calm. A control is a his anger to try to keep them from turning into the hulk.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       But there's this documentary called choke and it documents Hicks and competing in the 1994 Japan valley to doe. He went over to a [inaudible] 96, maybe 96, I don't remember what year it was. Um, but he went over to Japan and competed in this big mixed martial arts tournament and when he was over there as part of the time that he spent was climbing into these freezing cold rivers and getting out of these waterfalls and meditating. Oh that's awesome. And there's video of him doing it in like his other family members tried to do it. They get in the water for a couple seconds. I'm like, fuck this right there he is. He's in there doing these, a yoga, breathing exercises. That's what women teaches a lot of that breathing to go along with. You have to be really, really careful. There's been people that have passed out doing the breathing exercise cause there there's so deep and it's really like giving you all that oxygen.

Speaker 2:          00:34:59       Yeah, I put it oxygen meter on my finger when I do the breathing exercises and I take it, I have a right around 98 like no one's ever really at a 100 all the time. Some people weird people are, but I can bring myself up to a hundred percent and what does it measuring the oxygen and the level in your blood? I just pure oxygen. Yeah. It's like a, you know those little meters that they clip on you when you go to the doctor's office, you can buy those for $15 on Amazon. So, but how's it did? Was it tapping into your blood somehow? Like how it measuring? It's a little led light that it shoots into your finger and through looking at the led through finger, like the same way, like your phone can measure your heart rate, right? So this does heart rate along with a blood oxygen level.

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       How the fuck does it know your blood oxygen level? I think magic and think, damn, this what a wonderful world we live in and it's available on Amazon prime for $15 not only is it amazing, it's also will be here in one hour of use. Postmates I'm fucking the JC to one click and I'm so addicted as the fall of Western civilization. The people that run those ups stores that get packages delivered to them and shit like that, they did not know what they're signing up for with one click and came around suicide rates through the roof. Like you gotta be hating life. I guess maybe they just really in the packages and they love it. I love it. Someone who has like a package fetish, there's like, fuck you, I'm more, Amazon's coming. People are in a weird shit. They are into weird shit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       I mean, I don't think there's ever a one thing that people have been into where I was like, ah, I can't believe it. You know how there's those people that get into video games like Farmville and all that and they spend like hundreds of pounds. There has to be the equivalent of Amazon, right? Oh, you don't have people that just want to click the shit out of Amazon every single day. My grandfather was dying. My grandfather, when he was really old after my grandmother died in particular, he was like super depressed and he got addicted to catalogs. It's really sad. They like my dad before he passed away, he started, you know, as he would give us, getting into his seventies started doing just more qvc shopping and just stuff to shows up and you're just like, damn, why'd you buy that? And granted, I mean he always had you always get cool stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       I was always like, oh, that's a cool way to slice tomatoes or whatever it may be that showed up, but it was like, you don't need it. I think old people, they just are, as our brain starts to go, they just come more susceptible to that kind of stuff. That is by everything. Yeah. That's why those late night televangelists are so dangerous. Super Dangerous. They are preying on people with faulty mechanisms and then they call it and donate $100 or whatever and they think they're going to save their child from diabetes or who knows. You know, they found a method a few years back that was really troubling and what the was is they would pray on the poorest of poor people and would do, would explain his late. They would say, I know you don't have any money. I know your bills are due. I know that you need this money, but if you send that money, God will multiply that money tenfold and they'd have all these people.

Speaker 2:          00:37:51       They'd say, I, you know, my rent was due, you know my carpet. They were going to repossess my car, but I sent $100 and the whole audience is clapping and cheering. I give a $100 to God. That's all this first, and then all of a sudden I hit that lottery ticket and a lottery ticket. I said, good Lord, it's $500 it's true. Jesus gave me $500 and everybody's clapping and cheering and they would go on to another story. Meanwhile, this guy's got a fucking f $5,000 suit on. It's probably driving a Bentley. It's, it's dark. It's the preying on people that have just faulty mechanisms. Their brain is not working right and at their lowest possible point and then you're just kicking them. They're down. It's really, really sad. The old ones, we're worried about death. I mean death is imminent. It's on the way the body's feeling and as body's failing,

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       here's some guy on television that's saying a bunch of things that you know, and I think there's like sort of the, a window of, of cognitive function that starts to close and it's very hard to, to perceive and you're on the outside. You have to kind of like talk to them a lot to see like, oh, your ability to think is really clearly compromised right now. Right? And, but you know, they talk and they talk and they seem fairly normal. But if you're around them a lot, then you kind of get the full picture of what's going on. And those, those types of people, like man, that's what they, they're going to prey on. Yeah. I mean it happens. This is, I don't know if you ever get forwarded those email chains that like people send around. My mom is obsessed with this kind of stuff in her, in her seventies and it just like, you know, people saying that something is a fact, especially in politics as well when it's just made up, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:39:26       And then it's like, well I got it an email and it said that it was from CNN. I'm like, mom, did you click the link to, to actually take you to CNN? Did it actually should say that in the article? You know, it's, it's just difficult because they believe anything that is on the Internet. Yeah. And there's also, I mean obviously confirmation bias. Like you could always find a form that will tell you that the world is flat. There's a whole flat earth community out there. They've openly mock me. They're angry at me. Are you serious? Oh yeah, they've made videos. How big or how big is the flat k? Look, if you, if you stop and think about the sheer numbers of people just in this country, just let's, let's go with America. There's 300 million people in this country plus, right? At least one out of a hundred is a fucking idiot, right?

Speaker 3:          00:40:07       At least. So you have 3 million fucking idiots just in this country and out of those fucking idiots, you can tell. I have a friend of thinks here. If it's flat, that really fully believe I'm talking to you, bitch, he's crazy. He's great guy, great pool player. A professional pool player thinks the fucking world is flat. Who's, he was arguing with my friend Justin about whether or earth was flat, uncle Max. There's all these fucking pictures. He goes, I think those pictures and fake. So everyone's in on it from the beginning of time since they started taking pictures of planets, all those planets, The sun, the moon, Jupiter, all that shit just happens to be round and you're not buying it. Holy Shit. Yeah. Holy Shit. You just have to feel compassion for those people then. Right? It's circular. But it's flat. It's something's not right upstairs. Well, I think people love to be the person who does.

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       I think there's like a, there's something going on in the human brain or the human brain has always been curious and we're trying to innovate and it's like there's like a, a part of the brain that has this insatiable desire to create better things and to innovate and to constantly find a better way in that. We're always constantly searching for secrets as well. Oh, well if you do that, then it works. Hey, you take this flint and you're banging it against this steel, you can make a fire. So we find these things and then we're always trying to find the things that people are hiding. Like what are they hiding from us? Right. What kind of secrets? And he find out about some secrets that are true and some conspiracies that absolutely do exist, whether it's William Randolph hearst, whether it's fucking Rockefeller trying to keep, you know, alcohol from being legal because he wants to protect the gasoline market.

Speaker 3:          00:41:47       It's like all these like real conspiracies that you find out and they fuel the speculation and then they want to be the one that tells you, you know that the sky is falling. Right. They want to be the one. There's no way around that. It's just going to happen until the end of days, 2000 and you know, it's a weird aspect of people. It's a, well it's also, but I bet you believe in a few of those as well. I mean like what is your take on Ufo shows? I don't think it's impossible that we have been visited by see no evidence. Don't think it's impossible. So you do think it's possible? I think it's absolutely possible that we could have been visited by a life form from another planet and one point in time, but there's no evidence. Zero, zero. So you don't think any of the photos, any of the videos and those objects moving in my possession is the thing that I've seen some objects that move in space that are fascinating.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       Yeah. Like some fast. And you're like, how did that jump across? I mean, that's amazing to me. I don't know what that is, but also there's also some weird shit that's, that absolutely exists that they can prove on earth. Like bald lightening. Have you ever seen ball lightning? No. This video is a ball lightning. Paul lightning is like sums, weird phenomenon where lightening instead of coming down to the ground, it can fly around like a ball. Yeah, yeah. That's probably half of the videos. You have a good percentage. There's a lot of them that are just stars for people who are just retarded and they, they look, oh, it's all like move. Yeah. I mean there's been firefighters that have launched missiles, it stars planets or whatever. It's like there was something about that Venus, you know, people think the Venus is a spaceship and I think there's, there's also absolutely been experimental aircrafts, right.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       When we were filming fear factor in, um, I'm way out in the middle of the desert and Palmdale, which is near Edwards air force base and they had the stealth bombers, it was like right after September 11th and you watch those things fly over, you swear to God, you're in Star Wars. Like, okay, that's spaceship. Darth vader lives on that, right? He's flying that like this is, this is not a person in there because it looks like a star ship. I've, uh, I spent a lot of time out in the desert. I used to work at the Nevada test site by, uh, area 51. He did back way back in 2000 and you do out there? Well, I was into technology and uh, this was, um, kind of when I was studying computer science and so I was working out there, pretty low level job, but I had to bounce around between the different areas. So there's, the test side is divided into, you know, 50 plus areas and like groom lake, like that area lake is one of them. That's area 51 that's the best known, but there's so many other areas like, and there's different things on every plot of land. And so, um, there's one called a beef, which is the big explosive experimental facility. Um, there's a lot of sub critical nuclear testing has done underground so it doesn't break any treaties, but they can figure

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       out, um, the yield based on the test that they do. So they can still do kind of nuclear tasks, but it's not actually producing a, but it's still closed off all the areas when they do it. Um, and then there's every three letter agency you could imagine, rents out a piece of the test site to do tests and experiments. So it was my job to set up all the, at the time, no Ville networking equipment between areas so that they can talk to each other. What year was this? 2000, uh, just before that, 99, 98. 98. 99. 2000. What was the year where they had to admit that that was actually a base because they had to expand the area that was forbidden to trespass on? Yeah. I'm not sure what, what was in the 90s, because they had denied it forever. They did when I was there.

Speaker 1:          00:45:17       But it was so obvious, like you would go into the, um, it was weird because they were just, you would go into the, well first of all, you couldn't go to any, any area unless you had a reason to be there. And he also had to have a proper security clearance. So I had what was called the q clearance and then even if I had, which was top secret, but even if I had top secret in less, I had a request. And then if I went into an area that had sensitive information, I would also have to be escorted at the same time. But some of the areas that weren't really classified, they were just secret areas. Like, um, the power facility for example, you'd walk in and they'd have the chilled power clearly going to groom lake. Like it would, you could see the line going straight to groom lake, but they would say it didn't exist, but it would show the line going up there.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       And it was just like, that's so silly. Like why would you even show that if that was the case, you know? Well, I think they probably feel like no one can go there. So what are you going to do? Right. We just, it's easier to deny it go fuck off. It's not real. Yeah. The air force took that over, um, when I was there. So the air force was running it. Um, it was department of Energy, which handles all of our nuclear program. Uh, but then the air force, and then there's another, there's extra guard gates before you get there. So when you head into mercury in Nevada, you get through one guard gate, which is show your badge. Um, guard comes on, the bus touches your badge, looks at your id all if I could touches it touches, it has to physically touch it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       I don't know. It was just a thing. It was a requirement. They have one them feel that it was real because it was just like laminated a certain way. So I didn't know what they had to touch it. Um, and then once you get through the, the, the front gate there, then to go and do a further areas, you could drive out there but you, there'd be other gates if there was secret information going on between, um, where you left and where you were headed. So if you want to get to groom lake, there was one other guard station just outside of, um, the, the sedan, sedan crater. If you look up sedan crater on Google, there's this massive crater that was done via nuclear test and right past that is one, one more guard station. So it's severely compartmentalized. Oh, absolutely. Wow. And then a in an area can go dark and then then, you know, department of defense can come in and take it over and just do test there for three months and then it's dark again and they just destroy everything they were working on now, like this massive crater from the nuclear tests, like they're all over the place.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       So the test that is just filled with craters, craters, that's so crazy. And you can stand on the edge of their, they have a little platform there. It's kind of fun. Well, they did some, some pretty extensive nuclear tests out there. Oh yeah, absolutely. We had to wear a little dishonor around our necks and make sure you're okay. Well it wasn't real time, sadly. So you would send it in and get it analyzed afterwards and they tell you how much radiation exposure you had fucking Christ. But you know, we were all going in. It was so mellow back then. It was already kind of all cleared out. That's so spooky though. It is spooky. There's all these craters all over the place where they were just like a warning. Just drive up to, yes. Yeah. Tribes would like to get out. Now, when you were there, was there anything that made you think that the government had any knowledge of extra terrestrial aircrafts?

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       Was there any whispers of it? Where's her? Uh, there was whispers of a few things, but they weren't like Iti related stuff. It was just a, it was government projects, like other, other secret test projects that were going on. So you think that's what a lot of people were seeing when they're talking about, I think it was five flying. I truly believe, even though this isn't, I never heard of anything, but I had, I dunno, there was friends that we had that worked out in those areas and I think they were experimenting just based on the skill sets that were going out there on a kind of antigravity related stuff. Ooh. So that's, that's kind of what groom lake wasn't being used at that point in time for any more research and development. I think all that had been, I think it was all kind of underground cause a lot of that is underground.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       It's an underground base as well. So there's hangers out there and there's a really long runway. But that was all for testing. That was done in like the, you know, the seventies and eighties that were done out there. Fuck man, I would love to go see what an underground base looks like. Yeah, they must raise the state of the art. You would think that. But it, a lot of this is underfunded stuff really went underground one time in one of the areas and they make you take this respirator training before you go underneath there. So you have to know how to use these emergency packs in case just no air in case there was no air. First of all it's really cold. It gets really cold immediately as you start to go ground. Um, and like, you know where I was wearing a jacket, like it was, it was 40, I don't know, it was so long ago, but it was, it was where I had to wear like a lightweight jacket, like a meat locker or like refrigerator.

Speaker 1:          00:49:56       Well it was once we got down in there, it was kind of during the, when you go down into the, the shaft that was, that was when it was a chilly. But once we got in there was a little bit more climate controlled. Um, but you know, they go down underneath the ground to do some of these experiments and so that's part of the reason why I had to go down there. Whoa. The other big thing out there is really awesome. It's called the Daft, the, uh, device assembly facility. Daff you can, you can go with that one as well. This is where they assembled nuclear weapons in the United States, which is just, um,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       so that was, that was another fun one to check out. That was a super, super guarded facility. That one was extremely hard to get into. So these underground bases are underfunded. Well, this one in particular was used for experiments, so it wasn't like a permanent thing. Right. A lot of these, so for example, when they did the subcritical nuclear tests, they would have you go all the way underground. They'd set up all the test equipment, they would seal it with concrete, they would detonate it and then they would close off the whole, so it was always locked down in, just underneath there. And so that's, that's Kinda just underground forever. That sounds like such a crazy way to do it. I mean, they just didn't have the funds or you know, they're not going to go in there and dig up a bunch of busted equipment that already detonated.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       So it's like, well, it seems like a halfway thought out idea. Like someone goes, well, how are we going to contain the explosion? Okay, okay, okay, okay. This is what we're gonna do. We're going to blow it up and we're going to seal it off. Okay. And then they just went with it. Like nobody came along and go, hey, fuck head. You can't do that. Right. No, that makes that place like toxic for 100,000 a year. You know, this is, this is a facility that's the size of Rhode Island. I mean, it's massive. There's so many wacky nuclear experiments that they did between 1940 oh yeah. Like when they stopped. This is one of them is the most bizarre. It's called operation starfish prime, where they detonated a nuclear bomb in the atmosphere. They shot a nuclear bomb up into the Mag Nino's fear just to kind of, to see what it had happened.

Speaker 2:          00:51:50       Why would you do that? They wanted to see what would happen. I don't mean, I don't know what their experiment, I mean you would have to actually talk to the original scientists because then the fact that we know about it at all, it's fucking insane, right? They did this, but they, they shot it like up into the van Allen radiation belts and just launched a fucking bomb up there. I don't know to see if they could blow a hole through it. This was when they were doing manned space missions too, so they might have been trying to blow a hole, so to make it less radiation up there when they're sending astronauts through it like crazy and who the fuck knows, but the fact that they didn't know what was going to happen and they decided to try it anyway, just like, okay, we'll just shoot a fucking megaton bomb up into the atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          00:52:31       The worst case scenario though is really bad, right? Like really, really, really, really, really bad. Yeah. Like fucking a million people die of cancer or something. I mean, who the hell knows? What does this one asking? Is that real picture? It says that operation, is starfish happened during operation or would you say starfish? Starfish prime. It's called during operation. Dominic and his picture pops up. Well, they, it's probably real. I mean they did so many of them. The one of my favorite ones of all time was one where they did it in the ocean and they really didn't know what kind of a reaction they would have inside the ocean from a nuclear bottle. I've seen that one. They video footage of that. Thank God. Yeah, absolutely. Jamie. See if you could see that detonated nuclear bomb in the ocean to find that, but it is.

Speaker 2:          00:53:16       It was beyond what they thought the impact is going to be like. They actually had bowel shipstation. Right. I saw them. That'll ship wrecked me. I don't know how many people died and didn't know if there was even people on those battleships. I think they were telling me ships. Right. I thought that was hopefully, hopefully, because when it happened, I mean, what in the fuck? I mean that water goes a mile high up into the sky. It's insane. This is not the best video. There's a way better video where there is a bunch of ships around it and you see the ships just get overwhelmed by the water airs. One of them look at that like there, there is a perspective shot cause you kind of get a sense, I mean fuck man, nuclear power is insane and nuclear bombs are way more insane. The idea that you're going to split Adams and it's going to cause a reaction that is just so almost inconceivably powerful to the average person.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       Like what could be when we have like sort of a metric in our head about, okay this is a firecracker, right? And then this is an mat. It's here's, here's the video. Yeah this is the big one. It's so fucking, it's a mile into the air. You know, here is an mat, here is a stick of dynamite. Okay, here's a nuclear bomb. Like oh well it's just, it's so, it's so exponentially more powerful than anything that we can kind of wrap our brains around. And this is also, you know, what was this, what year was this shaming? This happened. 1950 [inaudible] 58 imagine what they have now. Right. I mean, the 2016 version of that, I mean there's just no more water. Right? The oceans gone, you know, the ocean becomes a Sahara desert. That's crazy. Yeah. I mean, humans are bananas, man. We're a weird little animal.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       And how long did you work out there at this test facility that was out there for about two and a half. Close to three years. Were you familiar at all with Robert Lasar? Yes. What did you think about that? Ah, I had heard that he was a contractor and it wasn't, the story wasn't all that right. Um, I heard that the area he talks about s three I heard that's true. That is a real thing. But I, I don't know about his stories. His whole thing was a folding space and time and yeah, I don't know about that. Well, he's a, he's one of those guys that if you're a dummy and you listened to him, I mean you, you go, oh well he makes it, he's making sense. And he seemed so confident. Like I listened to him, I don't know what the fuck he saying like he's talking about magnetic drives cause I'm a dummy so I'm listening to this, this magnetic drive talk and talking about these space ships and I'm like, Oh my God, this guy is telling the truth. Right. Because I don't know any better. But if, I'm sure if I was a real physicist and I listened to him and be like up to this. That's not how it works. What you saw, what? What'd you say? No, that doesn't work like that. You just have him on the show with yeah, with exactly. I don't even know if he gives it interviews anymore. I mean I haven't heard about the guy forever. Yeah, he was a, they were saying he was a contractor working for, was it dod or something like that or

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       I don't remember. It was weird because he was never in any of the official like catalogs of books or anything like that. So his story is a little bit, I dunno, we'll also, one of the guys is a guy named Stanton Freedman who's one of the premiere uff ologists. He's actually like a highly educated guy that's very skeptical, but most ufo claims was still believes it's possible. He did some research into the guy's background and believes that he lied about his education and lied about like different places that he worked. But I dunno, you know, it's, it's, it's not, it's fun to, to pay attention to, but it's one of those things where you're like, man, I'm not really going to get a resolution here. Right. So it's just, for me, it's the once a year, 1130 at night youtube video fest, right. To sit back and I'm just like, I watched like three hours of youtube videos.

Speaker 3:          00:57:15       I'm like, oh my God, Ufos. And then I go to bed and the next day and then it happens again in a year. So, well I think for sure it's possible that there's life out there in the universe that is as intelligent as us. But it's also possible that we're the only one. And the reason why I think it's possible that we're the only ones, there's hundreds of millions of life forms on earth, but we're the only one with an atoll where the only one with iphones, we're the only one that knows how to use the Internet. We're the only one out of these hundreds of millions of life forms on this goldilocks planet. It would make, oh, you mean that up just our pos planet. So you were saying out of all planets were the only ones that use an iphone. I was like, well that kind of makes sense. We kind of invented it, but I mean out of this, at this planet, you know, it's not like we go into the fucking Congo and we find some strange species that knows how to send emails to each other.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       You know, we're the only one and then again, dolphins, they do weird shit with each other. They can talk and whatnot. We can only that you can't do most of that stuff. Well, not only that, we don't understand what they're saying, which is kind of weird because we're supposed to be top being here. Are you familiar at all with John Lilly? No. John Lilly's the guy who created the sensory deprivation tank. Oh yes. I've done that. And he was also a pioneer of interspecies communication. He used to do acid and get in this, uh, so keep your deprivation tank next to a dolphin tank and he tried to communicate with the dolphins and his did that work? Oh, who the fuck man? It sounds like it kind of could probably kind of good. I mean maybe at the moment while he was tripping balls floating and hearing, he probably kind of got a sense of what they were saying.

Speaker 3:          00:58:53       I was in a tank once and I swore that it was an experience that, I mean the imagination is a very strange thing. You know? Imagine imagination is very weird because it's a lot of people, when you think of the imagination, you think of, oh, he's making things up in his mind that aren't real. That's like the standard way of looking at the imagination and really like pragmatic hard nose. People would go, ah, all he's doing is sitting around all day imagining things. But imagination is responsible for that clock, this computer, the coffee mugs, how to you ceramics, microphones. Every fucking object on earth is all created out of the imagination. And I was in a sensory deprivation tank and I had this experience where I was in the jungle. And not only was I listening to these people speak this strange language but are still understood.

Speaker 3:          00:59:46       You were not an Ios guy or anything? No, I was high as fuck. I forget what it was on. It was most likely edible po edible pod is my drug of choice in sensory deprivation tanks. Cause I think um, I think it'll pop first of all is one of the most underrated psychedelic compounds. I just think people don't realize that there is a profound difference between thc and what happens when your liver processes it, which is 11 hydroxy metabolite, which is four to five times more psychoactive than thc. Which is why a lot of people think when they eat pot cookies that it was laced and something was in there. No, no. That is, that's what happens when you eat cannabis. That's what's responsible for the vedic texts. A lot of the ancient Hindu uh, documents like all of their, um, like a Yogi practices.

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       Like I was a lot of that was about eating hash. Really eating hash has been a tradition amongst people for thousands and thousands of years. Eat the hash like this sticky hash that yeah, you can eat that for sure. I didn't know that that you have to smoke it because it's already been broken down. So it's, well especially when you cook it, you cook it in something fat soluble and then you then, and then you eat it. Like that's how you get it. Right. And even in candy form, I don't know exactly how they're making it, but you're eating it, you know, so it's whatever it is that allows your body to process it. But when you do that inside a sensory deprivation tank, like on a a pretty decent size dose, you have some wild ass experience bad. And one of mine was, I was in the jungle and I was with these people, these, these indigenous people and whatever, wherever this jungle was.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       And they were talking, and not only did I understand what they were saying, but I was thinking in their language. It was very brief. It was very brief. And then I was, and then I realized what I was doing that I woke up, but I could never bring myself back to that state again. But I remember that this experience, which probably only lasted a couple minutes at most, was sensational. It was very strange. And I was trying to think like maybe this is like some sort of like a deeply tucked away genetic memory from back when you know the great, great, great ancestors of whoever was, you know, if you have to think any person that's alive today, somehow or another, your genes must be traced back to ancient people. Those, there's only one way. You didn't get come out of a fucking a three d printer six weeks ago.

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       You are a product of hundreds of millions of years of life. Right? So if that is the case, some of that is probably tucked away inside your jeans. Interesting. And there's this guy named trick. Well, I think it's possible that there are little like you know how sometimes someone will bring something up, like a, someone will say, hey man, you remember that guy who went to high school with and then they go, oh yeah. And then all of a sudden you remember Mike and then you remember Mike's Weird car and you remember Mike's Girlfriend who beat him up and had that person. I've given you that cue. It would have been gone forever. I think it's like, I think there are folders and one of the reasons why I say this is because, um, I have, I have a very obvious folders. Like when I'm talking about certain things, like say if we're talking about um, you know, whatever psychedelic drugs or monkeys or anything, it's like my mind has like a bunch of information that they can draw upon.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       But if you bring up something that I normally would be very knowledgeable about, like maybe mixed martial arts, like start asking me about certain fights are fighters. I have to go, oh yeah, hold on. But if I was commentating on a UFC and it came up, it would be there for me. It'd be right there. It's like that folder would be, and I'd be able to access it. So you just take it saying it takes a little while for the folder to get open sometimes. Sometimes like that has to be your point of focus. I mean, I don't understand memory entirely. I don't necessarily understand how it works and how it varies so much. Like there's sometimes where like what does that fucking word? What's that fucking word? And then it comes out and go, yeah, how could I forget that? Worried. That happens all the time and it's, it's worse as you get older too.

Speaker 3:          01:03:53       What is, what's happened to me my whole life? I don't think it's gotten any better or worse. It's, it's always been that thing like what's that fucking word? And then someone will say it and he's like, yes. Right, but what is that like? Why is memory variable? Like, why has it come and why is it go and why is it enhanced by certain compounds like per acetone and things along those lines. Coleen, there's like certain different things that will enhance your, your ability to memorize things or remember things, recall things. But I think that it's got to be possible that somewhere deep, deep down in our DNA or genome or something. There's some memories like, and I think those, a lot of those memories are instincts like, um, rupert sheldrake, who's a guy who's been on this podcast before, he's a, he like evolutionary biologist or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:04:42       One of his, um, theories was about why children who live in cities or afraid of monsters and he thinks that there is a deep seated genetic memory of us being preyed upon by cats, by Jaguars and leopards and things along those lines. You know, back when we were, you know, less evolved hominids and that we're living in the trees and that these cats are jack and us and they do it at night. And that's why we're terrified of the night and the darkness and monsters, you know, we think kids, they live in their cities. They should be scared about bullets and crime and car accidents and train derailments and things that are really probably will be in several thousand years once we'd like. Right. That's becomes a part of the genome, right? Yeah. Who knows, man. I mean, but I, I, I found that experience being in the tank.

Speaker 3:          01:05:30       It was so real. That was what was bizarre and it easily could be marijuana plus imagination plus sensory deprivation creates this. Really, I mean, that's a good comment. That's amazing. Strong. It's amazing. What do you think about Iowaska and all these other, it seems like that's the hot thing everyone's doing these days. Well, it's time. Ethel. Tryptamine right. I mean, that's what I would ask is if chemo smoke that on their own. Yeah, I've swiped it. Oh, you have? Yeah. Yeah. I've never done Iowasca because I've never found anybody that's willing to get it to me without going to the jungle. Ah, you got to do the ceremony. But the DMT experiencing itself is unbelievably intense. And just dmt itself is, it's, it's a more powerful version of Iowasca like Iowasca from what it's been explained to me, for everyone who's done it is longer and oftentimes more introspective and it can be more profound even because it lasts longer and you have more time to sort of take in the experience.

Speaker 3:          01:06:28       But as far as the intensity of the experience, it's not as intense as when you smoke dmt Andrew's day and smoking dmt is not as, it's not as powerful as when it's injected intravenously. And that's how they did it with Doctor Rick strassman under the University of New Mexico did a series of tests, clinical trials on plank, and he documented it in a book called Dmt, the spirit molecule. I've heard about that. Isn't there a documentary on that as well? Yeah, I narrated it. Oh, you tell the host of it. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, that's a, it's a really interesting documentary because it deals with a lot of scientists and their experience with a, with dimethyltryptamine and trying to understand like what this compound is and why it exists, but the trips that people had when they took it intravenously, we're like half hour long just journeys into insanity into this like bad insanity.

Speaker 3:          01:07:23       No, no, no. All of them, I believe afterwards said that it profoundly enhanced their life and their perspective and gave them a view of reality that forever change the way they look at things about interactions, life and, and I, I could say that about myself, like my experiences with dmt have definitely profoundly changed the way I view possibility because it's so impossibly dynamic and insane and it just doesn't seem like anything that you could have ever imagined. And what I Wasa is, is an orally active version of DMT because DMT is insanely common. It is. It's in thousands of different plants. It's in all sorts of different ecosystems all over the world have plants that have DMT, including a lot of grasses, like full Eris grasses, which is really common. It's rich and tmt. Hmm. But you can't extract it. Well, you can't extract it for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:08:23       Absolutely. Like you have to just know what you're doing. If you're a chemist, it's actually not that difficult. It's a reason why DMT, if you know people who know how to get DMT, the actual raw plants that's have dmt, you can't make illegal because there's too many of them. Interesting. It's like you would have to make like, it's one of the, um, there's some scholars out of Jerusalem that believe that this is the literal interpretation of what Moses was experiencing when experiencing, when experiencing the burning Bush and talking to God. They believe that burning Bush is the acacia tree because the Acacia tree is very rich and dmt and extremely common in that part of the world. So it was Moses smoking most likely, like if you smoke the Acacia tree, do you get the DMT? I'm sure. I'm sure if you light those trees on fire, you're going to absorb a certain quantity of DMT.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       It wouldn't be as pure as like extracting it in a lab, breaking it down to the Rod dmt crystals. Then freebasing it, which is what you do. That's probably way more intense, but it's entirely likely that there is a method of doing it because the method that they found in the Amazon, it's extremely convoluted. Like what they did was when you, when you eat, if you eat a plant right that has dmt in it, your body produces something called Mano Amy and oxidase that breaks down the dime. Ethel tryptamine in the, in the plant and you won't, you won't experience it like eating we'd, it does nothing unless it's been already pre broken down, but even more different because we'd has to be like cooked in something in order to activate it. But if you just eat it straight up, just like the plant itself, you won't feel anything.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       I don't think so. You don't, you're supposed to really good for you though. If you eat like juicing, juicing it like it's supposed to be like really rich in phytonutrients and it's supposed to be really rich and CBDS too, which don't necessarily get you high, but a really good for you and good for inflammation. She was seeing it. Yeah, it's a big thing, man. People juice it. It's really, really super common. Like wheat grass juice. But they do it with cannabis. They take the leaves and they throw it and choose her. You get those at like the dispensaries here? Um, no, no, but I've seen it online. I've never actually seen it in person, but I definitely have seen it online. So what these people have done when they created Iowasca and they've been doing this for, no one knows how long, but they believe it's been thousands and thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          01:10:37       It's really hard to try to figure out how long they've been doing it. But they take the leaf of one plant which contains harming, which is a natural Mao inhibitor and they take the roots or the vine of another plant, which has the dimethyltryptamine in it and they boil it. So sort of a that process. So they figured out how to make their own pharmacological solution to love absorbing dmt orally, which is crazy. Well they say the plants told them how to do it. Of course they said that. I don't know if that's wrong. I mean, I just think our, our view of what

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       a plant is, it's like, Whoa, I talked to my firm, it never says anything. He got a plant that's in a fucking plastic cup. I think it's probably analogous to the difference between that little tiny pig that's like a little baby pig and a fucking wild paid who's out there hustling, making shit happen. You know, there's a picture I met money put up on my instagram a few days ago of a wild boar running off of the fon and its mouth. And you know, and it's, it's a very shocking picture because we don't think of pigs as being predators. Right. But there are opportunities and they absolutely will prey on something if they can catch it. But that image is like as far removed on the spectrum from that little pig, that little tiny pig that's got a guitar on his lap, you know, like look at this thing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       Wow. That bore and that is a, that that picks that playing guitar. Yeah. And that's America. That's a bore in America running off of the deer farm. And it's its, uh, its mouth that the spores are big, they're fucking huge. They get enormous, they get enormous. And you know, there's ones that, uh, they've, they've caught them or kill them that are, you know, pushing a thousand pounds out there in the wild. But I think that, that, that is a wild animal, you know, and I think these wild plants that it living in the jungle that are alive in the rain forest and had been there for thousands of years and this deep canopy of moisture and nutrients and plants and bugs and mammals and cats and all these different things. And then you got these people who live like the, the Toumani, they're walking barefoot through these fucking woods and Bolivia and throwing fucking spears at monkeys and shit and cooking them over the fire.

Speaker 2:          01:12:58       Like these people have been living like this for thousands of years. They're eating cocoa leaves and tripping their balls off monthly fun cookies. Yeah. It's supposed to be pretty awesome. Yeah. You've never tried it before? I've had the t yeah, I've had the coca demato tea, which I thought was pretty interesting. I couldn't shut the fuck up. I didn't like that aspect of it. The leaves are legal. You can buy the leaves. Can you, you can. I saw him on a Amazon actually. Yeah, they was fucking dea hustle. Well you need the, um, they had the compound to go with it. It's a little bit of that uh, lime or these baking soda. Baking soda. Yeah. And then you just chew it and basically it's like having a cup of coffee. Well it's supposed to be better for you. And it also has, it's actually like a healthy plant.

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       The phytonutrients, the, the, the vitamins from the actual leaves of the plant itself actually. Good for you. Yeah. It was actually chewing some with a doctor friend of mine and he's like, yeah, it's great. I don't, so you could just order it. Yeah, you can just order it and you just start ordering a Jeremy, I'm going to do a podcast with a big fucking baseball sized cha. That's exactly what you did. Put like a little wad in your mouth that it's a like, you know, the conversation started. I think it's entirely possible that these people that are eating plants that have psychedelic properties to them, whether it's mushrooms and you know there's a lot of mushrooms that you can eat that and also in the same areas with a lot of

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       silicide been. So they're, they're chewing these siliciden mushrooms and they have these ideas of iconic combined these things. You're talking about hundreds of different species of plants and these fucking guys have figured out how to take these two and combine them in some really crazy involved way where you boiling it and how, what's the explanation? There's no explanation that makes any sense other than the plants gave them the hints. Yeah, I think that I've always believed, and I've my, my wife's a neuroscientist, so we talk about this stuff a lot in debate it, but I've always believed that, you know, we know about the senses that we've documented and I think that there's certain things that we can take the activate other senses that we didn't know were there and allow us to do certain things. Like for example, talk to plants or whatever it may be.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       It's not going to be the, you know, I'm having a conversation and it's talking back to me. But it could be a feeling or a vibe or they know some way of anything else there. You know, we'll do you know, when scientists first found harming and a, I want to say this was in the early 19 hundreds, I forgot what you, what year it was, but when they first found harming, they wanted to call it telepathy mean the, I think it was psychiatry is Veritas. I think that was the plan that they found it in. I forget what the plant, they found that it was, but the, um, the compound, whatever it was, had allowed these people, these scientists to feel like they were experiencing some sort of communal thoughts and so they wanted to call it telepathy, but because of the fact that once they had isolated the compound figured out what it was, they realized that had already been named harming, you know, due to the, the rules of scientific nomenclature and they decided to just keep that name, but their name for it was going to be telepathy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:03       Raisie yeah, you want to hear it? This is a somewhat related topic, but I, I have, um, someone that I met that has a startup that catalogs people's dreams, so they, they fill out like a little small questionnaire after they have a dream and something that they've discovered. I don't know that they've published this or come out with any data, released it publicly, but people are dreaming the same thing on the same night. It's, it's, it's a thing. And so like in like masses of people are having the same dream. So what kind of dream? I don't know. I, this is like over a beer that we had this conversation at a, at a party. So I need to get back to them and say let's get this data out there. I'm curious as to what it is. Shit. Yeah, that's wild. Like, um, so how many people they're studying? Um, it's not as official study. It's just like an app for people that like to catalog and keep track of their dreams. So he's looking at it in aggregate and finding these patterns. So they recorded at nightly like, yeah, like you wake up in the morning and then like you write down, I dropped about sharks eating dolphins or whatever it is, and then they're seeing patterns and large groups.

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       It's really trippy, imaginative dreams or like a gigantic Sydney Opolis. And you could pick which movie you go into and there's a bunch of other people in the movie with you watching the same thing. It's a really weird, but also like movies, some thinking. It's beautiful. Others thinking it's shit. Right. You know, incredibly subjective. It's really a truck man. Crazy. That is God damn crazy. If that turns out to be something today, discover and that starts getting expanded upon and people start really bringing this up on a regular basis, we find out that that's, that's real hard data. That's going to be amazing. What a game changer that would be. Yeah, absolutely. Have you ever taken things before you go to bed to enhance dreams? I know, no. I'm gonna give you something before you leave. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever tried Alpha brain? No. Alpha brain is a nootropic and then there's this company on it.

Speaker 3:          01:18:00       My company produces coal. We have double blind placebo controlled studies showing that from the Boston center memory sewing that enhances memory, enhances executive function, enhances, um, reaction time. Wow. Also that your body, it puts your body in an Alpha state. It puts your mind in Alpha state. But one of the big things from it is if you take it before you go to bed, it gives you lucid dreams, like really vivid dreams. And the way I describe it as an, I try not to take it sometimes before I go to bed, just cause I don't want to wake up in the middle of night, freaked out, have to pay then can't go back to bed. I like, my sleep is precious to me. Like I need at least six hours to be functional. Oh, I'm the same way. And if I don't get it, I just, I preserve that sleep.

Speaker 3:          01:18:41       I guarded. Are you tracking it with like a fitbit or something? You No. And just sleep. But um, I sleep well but I'm really like diligent about it so I don't, I don't fuck, I don't go online late at night and freak myself out if I know I have to go to bed and I'm not going to like watch animal attacks or some fucking cops shooting some kid and just tripping out, you know what I mean? Oh absolutely. Yeah. There has to be a two hour window for me every night. I try to not do electronics and get flux too, which I'm sure you already have. What does flux? It's a for your laptop. It shuts off all the blue light. You know what I'm talking about? Oh, oh, so also apple, just a introduce this in the latest version of Ios you can turn on and takes out of the blue light out flux does it for the laptop.

Speaker 3:          01:19:21       Oh. And so at sunset this, the screen starts to remove all the blue light and it just, they're, they're saying it helps you sleep better. And I found that was the case. Yeah. There was this, um, this, uh, this futurist convention in New York City, a few back a few years back, 2042, they think that a, in 2042, you know, that's the going to be the year that artificial intelligence takes off. And there was all these Weirdos that were creating these robots so they could talk to and thinking they're going to download their consciousness and computers. Well, there's a bunch of guys who had these screens over their phones because they were convinced that the artificial light that's emanating from phones is damaging your brain and damaging sleep patterns and giving you an artificial light source, especially right before you go to bed. Could potentially disrupt your sleep. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the whole theory behind all of this stuff. Yeah. My wife was wearing these wacky glasses for a while, like, uh, like you remember the Baas Brian Bosworth, remember those fucking goes, those blades that would cover your whole face is this shoot led light and you're just like, uh, like it's like a orange. It's like, and that it was, the idea was that was, it would filter light. So the blockers, yes. In a way. Yeah. But it was designed specifically to calm the, uh, the interaction of your, your eyeballs with like, yeah. Amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:20:50       We're looking at a photo of Brian Bosworth who was a famous football guy from the 1980s, I guess with these ridiculous glasses that no one wants anyone to hearing to. Yeah. Let's terminator glasses. Those were the things right after the terminator. But these, um, goggles, these things that people wear, they wear them and they think that somehow or another like filtering the light will enhance your sleep and, hmm. Is there science behind all that? Like the flux thing or is she doesn't know. There was, I didn't look into the science. Um, but if apple's adding it, there must be something they wouldn't just do that for funsies. Yeah. I assume data behind it. Do you use all apple products? For the most part, I have an android phone as well, just to kind of mess around with stuff to stay current. But um, yeah, almost all apple.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       Yeah. I have an android phone to, um, I think the galaxy phones or they're probably pretty commensurate. I mean, I, I'm, when I go back and forth, I mean it's, one of them is to get used to it and the way it communicates with laptops and other apple people and the ability to airdrop stuff. There's like some definitely benefits. Sure. But there's also some benefits of the android platform to, you know, I liked the, uh, all the new Amazon prime stuff. Like they're the new TV. It's great. Yeah, it's got all the streaming. It's, it's better Ui, I think the new apple stuff. Yeah. I mean Amazon, I wish that it would catch up and become like a real competitor to Netflix. I think it's, they're kind of closing in there, creating their own content now and they're trying, they're trying to, uh, to really become like there are some options to where you can download the movie, the movies to your device, which you can't really do with Netflix.

Speaker 3:          01:22:25       So if you're on a plane or something like that, flying over the ocean, you're kind of fucked if you want to watch netflix. Um, but there's, there's also some stuff that I think, um, you can, you can definitely, you can definitely make the argument that it's probably a good idea to support emerging pot or other platforms as well. Like there's, it's not a good thing for everybody to be on apple. Right. You know, I think the more android's come up with more sophisticated devices and more interesting options and features and applications more, it's going to force apple to raise their bar as well. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that a lot of the Amazon stuff like the echo, like those devices in your home, you can speak to those

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       are, those are a lot of fun. I'm actually finding it pretty useful. Yeah. What do you use it for you that you're seeing there in the kitchen? You're like, I ran out of trash bags and you just say, you know, order me new trash bags and then it looks into your previous purchases. It knows that you've bought those bags before. It knows your home address and as your credit card. And I just thought I'd make this ends it out. And do you have to press a button to Santo, but just say it now. You just, you just query the device and just say, order me trash bags. That's it. So you have to talk to the device and say, Hey Alexa. And it's like people get mad when I say hey theory on the podcast, because then their phone starts going off. Turn that shit off folks, that, that series stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:23:42       She doesn't know what the difference between a podcast in your own voices. It's not ready yet. She's not the vest. She's not ready. Is there a Google version of Siri? There? It is, right? Yeah. What's it called? A okay. Google. Oh, and that's what you say it's same thing. Yeah. Google now. So they call ejc. Okay Google. And then it just, the Google one's actually quite good. I've been wanting to fuck around with a windows laptop for awhile. I can't bring myself to do it. And they got the new tablet and I use it for about a week and I send it back. Well, what's funny is you get it and you're so excited and you're like, oh, it looks cool. Like you know they've sold me because they come up with these like fun little videos and stuff and, and then you realize you're like, fuck, I'm in windows in your backend.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       Like it'll reappear. Like you'll go, it'll look like this beautiful interface and you're like, oh cool apps and all this and whatnot. And then you go into settings and it's like, there's like a 10,000 options and it, it defaults back to that old windows feel. I don't know if they fixed that with the latest version, but I mean that was my problem with it. I just, I realized this is just windows again and it, was this a tablet? It was a tablet. Can you still go into dos? Yeah. I think he can still go and still in command prompts. Yeah. Which I kind of liked. That brings back the old school. It's just um, there's some new laptops. Like Lenovo has some, a new thinkpads. They are pretty interesting. Really good keyboards. And what about the chromebook? Have you played around with that? No, haven't, those are pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          01:25:06       Well, I had a friend who worked for Google and she had one of those and I was like, okay, where do you store things on this? We can't, it's all in the cloud. What? You can't the fuck out of here? Like you can't, you don't have anything on your laptop, fuck off. No, I'm kind of like that now with the apple. Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Because then you can smash it. You can lose it, whatever. Who Cares? You just get a new one and you're back up and running in like 10 minutes. Do you, but do you have any of your writing that you don't want people to access that's up there in the cloud? You just use two factor auth and all that stuff? What is that? That's where it has to send you a text with a code in order for you to log in with a new device so that way, even if they know your password, they can't get into your stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:25:43       That makes sense. Yeah. So I have that turned on for everything and then yeah, everything's in the cloud. All photos, all videos, all documents, everything. You're a man with no porn. No, no, no. Dick pics are floating around. Spike. You feel real confident. You're like, yeah, it's in the cloud. Go ahead and look at pictures of my dog. Who gives a shit I saw. Yeah, there was a sticker I want to get. Is it like the cloud is really just someone else's computer, which is very true. It is it just someone else's computer? No clouds up in the sky. You fucks like why are you calling it the cloud when it's on the ground? That's so stupid. It's just someone's computer. It's a weird name. Like why? Why say the cloud? I don't understand why you would say the crises. Cyberspace. Yeah. I guess we don't really use cyberspace anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       That really wasn't that brought up. But the cloud is, is weird, but what would be a good replacement for what the clipboard, the cloud, uh, expression. I Dunno. I kinda like it. It's kind of stuck. It makes me think of this like, well, the thing about the cloud easy, it's redundant. Like you can never lose. Your data is distributed. So clouds are everywhere. So in theory, so as your data, which is concerning slash awesome. Hmm. Yeah. But if she, I just am always in this position where I say, well, what if, um, I can't get online and I want to have access to my stuff. Most of it is low, locally cached, right? So if you have a, you know, icloud on your desktop or dropbox or anything else, even if you're an airplane mode, it's still gonna be there. You just double click to open it.

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       You're good to go. It syncs the changes later. Um, you know, what you're doing it for is really just a fancy backup. You know, in case he ever lose the device, everything's there. The fancy backup is a great idea. But what would it actually disturbs me is the idea that we're going to get to a point where you don't have any hard drive space and so you're not storing anything. You're just accessing things that are somewhere else and you're paying for that service. I pay apple probably $150 a year for my cloud storage and it backs up all of my devices to have cloud. Do you do the apple music thing when you pay the eight bucks a month? I did play with it. I thought the interface kind of socks. Itunes is so bloated right now. What is cool though is Siri could call up songs and you just have on your phone like, Hey Siri, play Michael Jackson and it'll say what song and then you say thriller bitch.

Speaker 1:          01:28:00       Amazon does that too. The echo does that. Yeah. Yeah. You can just tell it to play anything and if you have Amazon prime, you get access to all their free prime music and then it just plays it. They're all doing it now and spotify. Everybody's doing it. Yeah. I feel like I want to fuck around with other platforms just because I'm just been such an apple dork. But then part of me goes, but that's just cause you're a procrastinator and you don't want to work. You want to start playing with some, oh I'm but I'll get to work. Once I figured out how to run this new lamp option and figured out how to format my hard drive now how do I de Frag on this windows device, what we all do it and then you always come back to apple. At least that's my, I've been in my experience cause you're just like, ah, there's some little things that it doesn't do right the way you're used to. And then he'd go back to also apple keeps getting better. The devices keep getting better. They just get it better and better and better. And like this one then I have, here is no his flash drive, which I'm fucking addicted to. So it powers on like that accesses data like that. I'm just so addicted to that because I remember the spinning spinning of the hard drive. Right. And if you dropped it the hard drive break. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       These things are bulletproof. They are, yeah. Is that one? That one's not retina display. That is, it is, yeah. That is, no, it's, Oh that's a Mac book pro. Yeah. Okay. That's, yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Rather displays a big difference. Pretty Slick. Especially when I had my glasses on. Yeah. On a reading. Like when I don't have my glasses on, what's the point? It doesn't matter at that point. Barely can read text. I mean I could, I could kind of like this is in front of us. We were looking at it like normal size type like that. Right. Like I have to kind of like opened my eyes up wide and I can read it but it um, it's not good. I just bought it. It's hilarious cause I bought a book on how to correct your eyesight and how to, is that a real thing?

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       Yes. There's bates method, the base of bates method of improving your visions to dates method. Yeah. It's not like exercises for your eyes. Katy Bowman, Katy Katy Bowman, Katy Bowman who was on the podcast is kind of an expert and physical movement and she's got a lot of interesting ideas about biology and one of her thoughts about, about glasses and about, uh, when you spend a lot of time looking at computers, looking at a screen, she was like, you're looking at something that's a very fixed distance, which is unusual and the is not really designed to focus constantly on a fixed distance for eight hours a day. Your body's supposed to look at things that are over there, things that are up here, things that are everywhere. And in that way your body gets this broad range of things that you're viewing all of these different distances. And when you look at something that's in a fixed distance, she likens it to being in a cast like a year and a cast your, your muscles atrophy.

Speaker 3:          01:30:37       Ah, I hate that technology slowly killing us. I love it and hate it. I think it is. Absolutely. You know, I found myself, uh, w first Sandona wake up in the morning is like going to my phone and I stopped doing that. But it's just, it's taking over, you know, like look, just look around you like take one day and when you're, I walked to work in New York and I put my phone in my pocket and I just walk around and observe other people. Everyone is heads down in their phone. Oh yeah. Like if we were like visiting as this planet, it just observing this species called human, like you would say, oh, they're being controlled by this little thing that's telling them what to do. It looks like we're being controlled. Well, what's interesting is people say back in the day people didn't do that, but there's a photograph of the subway from like 1960 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:31:26       The reading papers, all of them, every fucking person is in their reading a newspaper. I think Peter, at least it was one tab, you know, he was like, it's like one page, like these people. Right. But like they're not, there's no tab browsing there but not jumping around reading the paper. All of them, man. They're not looking at each other. That's fair. This, this idea that we used to be amazing and we used to be gregarious and want to turn off tad browsing. It's, it's, that's what's killing me. Tabbed browsing on your phone just on, on your desktop computer. And I always say while leave that tab open, cause I'm definitely gonna need to get the APP tabs that have been open for months. How about this? Have you ever gone back to your email tab and like there's an email that you're supposed to hit send all yeah, like eight hours ago you're like, oh fuck yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:16       Yeah. Well you know it's definitely not perfect but I'm, I dunno, I'm a big fan of technology. I just, I'm also a fan of self discipline. I think you need, you need your own sort of boundaries that you won't cross. Right. Like, you know, x amount of time per day, you know, or six o'clock at night, I put everything away. We're done. That's it. If you need to get ahold of me, call me. You know, nobody fucking calls me on my phone. I shouldn't even have a home phone. It's fucking useless. Never answered that God damn thing. Yeah. Somebody calls me exactly, exactly. Why don't I have it? I was a little bit one. One was a fire on the right. You just need to get ahold of you. In fact, the neighborhood. Um, but there's levels. Like if someone, like I'll check my phone in the morning and I'll see text messages and I'll see if anything's important.

Speaker 3:          01:33:04       If someone I care about sends me a text message, then something might be important. That's level one. Level two is I'll check my email. That's like next level. Then level three is like, I started going into social media, instagram, instagram, facebook and twitter and you know, that's, and then there's level four. I started googling shit and checking out forums and reading information about stuff. But that's then, then you're going deeper and deeper into it. Then you're looking to be distracted, you know, I'll go to dig, you know, like get that for real man. That's like one of my main sources have been for years. My main sources of wacky shit going on in the world. It's still got a lot of wacky shit on there. You are you involved in it at all anymore? I mean technically I'm kind of an advisor to the company and now that I'm out in New York, I, they're based out there.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       So I spend, I see the team from time to time. Uh, but he was just, man, it was so many years of blood, sweat and tears that I kind of got burnt out. I was like, I can't look at any more cat videos, check out the window. It's just a great resource for someone who's just curious. Yeah. Let's see what's interesting out there. Ha ha ha. Oh, okay. You know, I'll look at it every day and I'll find at least one thing everyday that a half to read like holy shit and I have to click on it. But it's interesting because I'll send someone a dig link and there's a desire that people have a completely unfounded desire to be over something. You know, like my space, my space is a good example. If you sent someone, hey man, I want you to check out my thing. It's on my space. I've always wanted to bring back my space or I want to get an AOL. If I was in charge of AOL I would make their emails so bad ass that no one could deny it. Like just go, just go crazy. Do all the encryption shit that people are talking about. Do like unlimited space. Just like make it the most amazing bad ass email platforms. So it's like the cool thing again. So it's like g male plus like taking everything from like email.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       Email's probably the best three email platform. Right? How much better is it than Yahoo? Uh, I mean Yahoo has ads in there. Stuff like visible big ass ads. Those fucks. I know. What about hotmail? It's still around. How mill still around hot mill would be another one. You could probably turn into something pretty bad ass. Yeah. We'll get all the Microsoft prep out. Other though they own hotmail, right? Yeah. Mm. They make you sign on with a Microsoft account and all that weird stuff like prefers windows. Is there anyone that likes us? They try apple and they try windows and they go those windows things better. There's a lot of people out there, hardcore windows fans, but are they really windows fan? Massive country, right? Gamers. The gamers still love windows. You can't run oculus on a Mac yet. Well it's also, some people love all those options too.

Speaker 1:          01:35:44       They'd love Oculus rift on a map down. Oh No, not yet. That's a game chiller. Yeah. Change the game changer. The video cards aren't good enough. They're saying whoa. Really interesting. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Well, when you play video games on a Mac, do they have native versions of a, what? Do you have to switch over? Do you know? Like there's that, what does that, um, application that you can switch back and forth between windows and Mac? Yeah. They had like the boot camp, they called it where you could boot into the, that's still around. Yeah. The good news is that it's, it's all a intel hardware so you can boot into windows if you want to, but it's still like the, the graphics cards are a few generations behind. That's a weird, yeah. It's just like apple doesn't care. They don't have really anyone doing super high end gaming on their rigs, so they don't, that's not their, their game anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:36:30       Well you remember when Steve Jobs came back and they killed the clones? Yeah. That's when it was kind of weird because before then, like you could buy a Mac online. That was way more powerful than anything out. Apple was selling way more hard drive space. Sli video cards. They do an sli video. He's already done us a lie now that was, this was before then they had souped up like, uh, processors though and like much more power. Much more storage space. And then, you know, apple, it's like, fuck you. Yeah, but you can't, you still can't run Mac os on a PC. It's, it has, it has to have this, it's own rom like a special apple. Right. But I know people who've done it. There's hacks around it, but it never works, doesn't it? Never. Percent, uh, people are going to go crazy anytime there's like a software update, they just like patch it so you're not always running the latest.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       Uh, he was always a war like that. It's, it's, it's really interesting. It's really, really interesting the, the dual platform thing because it kind of becomes a tribe thing. You know, like people get addicted to rooting for one particular sprites team. You know, like I've been with the cubs since the beginning getting on know we went to clubs to the end. Yeah. You know, go cubs. They get that way with windows. They can take it the way the websites and everything. Like you were saying with my space and all those others, the same thing with dig. People were like pissed off at dig for a while. It changed. It's a look. Yeah. And when it changes its look, I got all these people are fucked, dude. What are they doing? I'm like, well when you're just looking to say fuck you, that's what you're looking to do.

Speaker 1:          01:37:58       It's like you look in to be over something. It's not like this is not a rational disagreement or a grievance you have. Yeah, there was a lot of, I mean there's a couple things. One, it's, we've, one thing we learned is that people, uh, they love when they get into something and really into it, they're hesitant to change. Like anything that you change, you move an icon or change a color or do any of that stuff. I think it's part of the reason probably why read it hasn't made a whole lot of big over arching changes to their product. It kind of feels the same. It looks the same functions the same is because people fell in love with that, you know? And it's a hard thing to do. You make any changes there and you have a revolt on your hands, you know? So for us it was difficult because we had taken a lot of investor funding and they wanted us to go very mainstream.

Speaker 1:          01:38:43       You know, there was like, there was always like, well, how can we get your mom reading, dig or whatever it may be. And I think that, you know, in retrospect, that was the, that was the wrong approach apps because we were, we should have been a loyal to our core audience and kind of been all about that, which the site is today. It's a lot more like it was back then. I mean the, granted the design has changed, but um, I think the content is more like that. And the mistake that we made is we tried to push into more kind of mainstream news when really what date may dig so special is that was able to unearth and find the really kind of unique, obscure random stuff from around the web. Right. So that was a, but it was a crazy ride. I mean we were, gosh, it was probably seven or so years that, um, we were kind of riding that wave, you know, and like all Internet properties, it's like if you can last five years, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          01:39:36       If you can last seven, that's unbelievable. And if you can last 10 that's like almost unheard of. I go to it every day. So to me nothing's changed. That's how I, that popularity, there's hasn't dropped off at all. I met, I met with the, uh, the John Borthwick, a heads up Beta works and he was saying it's something like a total of 42 million across all platform a month. Dig still receives. That's across mobile and desktop and everything else that they do. That's still a man, which is crazy. It's a lot of fucking people, man. It's nuts. It's just an, I love when someone can just collect things for you. There's some aggregates. All those interesting, weird, bizarre shit. It's a one stop shop. This is kind of always going to be in market for that. That's kind of my, what I'm doing now with my newsletter. I don't know if you saw that.

Speaker 1:          01:40:20       I launched a new newsletter. Yeah, launch a newsletter here just a few weeks ago and I only put it out once a month. Like I hate, I hate that. You know, when I was in television on techtv and some of the other stuff that we did, it was always about producing new content every single day. And you can never really put the best stuff out there. You're always in a rush to produce your segment. You're like, okay, what am I going to do today? Blah, blah, blah. And, and so I create a newsletter that is basically just, um, my favorite stories, videos, products, but things that are fully vetted that has spent a lot of time collecting. And I just, I released it once a month on the first of every month. Oh, that's great. The fully vetted things great. Because God, there's so many, well first of all, how many stories do you get that are completely contradicting something that was a story just a week ago.

Speaker 1:          01:41:07       Exactly. And you're like, well, who the fuck is right? Well now you've got to make me do research right now. I got to snopes this and figure this out and try to figure out who's team Amman and which articles seems most rational. And if then, if you can't do that, then you have to go into scientific papers and I'll fucking Christ. Then you have to contact people and search forums and see what the people that are actually studying this shit think. And it's nice if someone vents it out in advance. Yeah. So if I, if I put a product on there, it has to be something that like a technology product that I've used for at least a month. So I can tell you, you know, there's a lot of that kind of like I get hyped up on something for a few days and it actually ends up sucking and you've already plugged it in your life to give me an example of that.

Speaker 1:          01:41:42       Like what? I don't know it just like any new product that comes out, like, um, when the echo first came out, the Amazon Echo, it's like I, I think it got better with a few software updates. So I'm glad I didn't plug it initially cause I kinda thought it sucked but it, but it's a lot better now, but it took some time to get there. Um, I just want to make sure that if I'm, I feel like our time is really precious, all of our time is really precious and if you push someone to go read something or to buy something, it should be worth their time. And, and so I want to put a lot of effort into that, so, well, that's a great way to approach it for sure. And if someone's going to really get committed to paying attention to you on a regular basis, on a monthly basis, it's probably the best way to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:23       Yeah, sure. That you're filtering it out before it gets to them. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, it's called the journal. You can set up@thejournal.email. There's that email domain extensions down. Really? Yeah. It's a email list. Yeah. It's just an email is to put an email address to send one a month and um, and you can use it for anything. You can use a domain for it or whatever you want. But they came out with a dot. Email, domain extension. Um, but yeah, weird extension. What does it, cause usually they're from countries, right? Why? Yeah, it's normally from countries, but now they're opening up to everything. There's like.wine. Now there's dots like you know they have.porn yet there's dot x x, x. Oh, okay. And that's all porn. So expensive tography for my website there. Who Do? Ooh, look at, you can gene me. Dot. Photography. Um, what is something that's really got you hyped up?

Speaker 1:          01:43:08       Uh, the Arrow wifi system. E. R. O. What does that, ah, it's crazy. So you know how there's always been, we've had wifi units that it's like one base station to rule them all. Like you have one base station and they look, they get crazier every year. They have get more antennas on them. And this idea of one master base station, that blankets here entire house. It's, it's great if you have a small apartment. If you have a house or two bedroom or three bedroom, it's next to impossible to get like streaming video down at bedroom number three down the hall. So arrows like, okay, screw it. We're not going to make one master massive base station. We're going to make these little tiny like hockey puck style little stations and you get three of them in a pack and then you just plugged them in and around the house and they work off a mesh network.

Speaker 1:          01:43:56       So they all mesh with each other. They're not extenders. They're like using their own dedicated little wireless signals to do Mesh. Almost like the way a Sonos would operate in your house. Um, and then you just have universal blanket, a high speed coverage and so it doesn't vary no matter where you walk. Amazing. In New York, I was having issues like trying cause my Wifi or my um, cable modem was all the way on the other end of the house and I have a long hallway kind of going between the dining room, the front room and um, I plucked three of men all going down the hallway. And normally with these boosters or anything else, they just kind of like, they kind of suck. They just didn't ever work. Right. Yeah. And this one just, I mean set up on your iphone, how do you spell it?

Speaker 1:          01:44:35       E R O. Dot Com. Yeah, there they are right there. There's a three units, um, uh, on the screen there. But yeah, they're, they're pretty amazing and it's a, it's a new technology. One of their investors was telling me about it. Um, I bought them on Amazon and this is something that I just mentioned to my newsletter because I had some time to spend with it. And, and that actually really I, if you have wife, if your wife works great at home, don't mess with it. It's not worth it. But if you're having issues, this, this works, why does it have a phone there? They have an APP that we're set up is just what the phone, they don't even make you use a desktop to set it up at all. So just plug it into your, whatever you use. Like a, some sort of a, a cable that connects into your router.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       Yeah. You just plug it right in your router with the first base station and then you go and take the other ones. I'm just them around your house. Yeah, it's great. And how does it work with uh, the Apple Wifi system? I just got rid of the apple. I unplugged it all together and just use only that and that's only use this. Yeah. Interesting. Ooh, I like it better, Huh? Yeah, it's been getting great reviews. Um, you know, again, but it's, if your Wifi is working fine, don't mess with it. Like that's, but mine, I've, I've had, I must've like pissed off some kind of Wifi. God, in a previous life, I've never had good wifi. Some issues. I think everybody does. The wifi is, we're two hours a wondered what's going on with those signals. Just fucking flying around your house too, right? It's like, is that good?

Speaker 1:          01:45:58       I think you're fine. I think you're fine too, but I don't know. It's like that same thing you were saying about there could possibly be senses that we don't necessarily have like that we could measure and weigh, but there's a feeling that you get when you're like at the top of a mountain. If you go hiking and there's no wifi signal, it just feels cleaner. But it also could be the amazing fresh air could be, right? Yeah. Or maybe we can do some dmt at home and start reading people's email. Let's just like by intersecting nursing. Do you think there's gonna come a point in time where there is no longer any privacy, any privacy at all? I don't think so. I think privacy is a hot topic right now and people are, are really starting to get into it for the first time. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:46:37       So they definitely were concerned when you hear about the NSA thing, the Edward Snowden thing, and you find out that it's really pretty easy to access your information and you know, people worry about being hacked, right? Being fished, you know, someone sends you an email and people were worried about privacy. But my concern is that it seems like what what's going on with technology in general is, especially when it comes to the Internet and anything information based is your access to information is getting quicker and quicker. Right? It's like you have more access to more data and more access to each other and each other's data and eventually that means that keeps going and keeps going and keeps going. There's gonna come a point in time where we're just fucking reading each other's minds. Right. And when that happens, it's really not going to be a lot of privacy if at all.

Speaker 1:          01:47:25       Yeah, I think that there is, there's certainly people trying to push the envelope there and there has been over the last few years and in startups that I've seen like a, there was a startup that at one point, um, you would often all of your credit cards and it would share out socially the stuff that you were buying with friends. And so basically if you went on there and bought a, a blood, a sensor on Amazon, I would see that. And then I could then use that as a cover more or less an endorsement from you and go buy something similar. It blew up and it went out of business, but they were kind of pushing that. But there has to be a trade off, especially when it comes to free services. Like you can't expect to be a private person if you're getting something for free. You know, like if you're getting g mail, they are reading your emails and they're putting ads against it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       Now it's not a human reading them, but their machines are reading them and placing relevant ads and it's not spooky moment when you were looking something online and then you go and look to the corner of your, your website page and it's that exact ad. Right? But that's fine. I'm fine with that because it's free. I don't have to go drive down to the library and look up a book and trying to figure out what I was trying, you know, Google is providing that service and I'm like, thank you very much. Google and I will gladly take your ad. And if you're looking for like a pair of shoes and you went and researched a pair of shoes, then all sudden that pair of shoes is staring at you on the website. It's creepy, but I get it. It's terrible. It's not terrible. Yeah, because it's something that you already expressed intent towards.

Speaker 1:          01:48:53       You're like, I want that mct oil. Right. And now it's there again, it's not like sexual deviants shit. Right. You know, sometimes it could be a is it depends on the targeting. But if they do that though it, Google doesn't allow that now. Yeah, that would be rough. Yeah. Try explaining that. Yeah. That's a cause for bitten by the terms of service. Must be, which it's funny because that's where people draw the line. It was like sexual pleasure, like sexual pleasure and sexual fantasies. That's where we draw the line. Right. But what you can talk about openly and have, you know, I mean you could have a shoe fetish and you'd be like really into shoes. Have you ever met anyone that openly says they have a shoe fetish? I don't think that that's a, that's a, um, you can tell him. He might not say it's a welfare sexual fetish. No, but all those fucking Weirdos that are connect collect sneakers. You know who you are. Right. All those years thinking the Nike sneaker collectors are also, Jamie's one of them looking them over there smiling. He buys

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       those Kanye West sneakers. Really? Him, he wants to try to find him, can't get 'em. They're sold out. The question is like how get them any, how bad do you want them? Is it like a, I like to have them or like I will, I don't know anything. My friend Brendan, he buys pairs and then he won't wear them until he knows he's got to do something important. And then you put on a special pair of Jordans. I'm like, you all have that though. I used to collect old microprocessors. Really? What'd you do? And you actually I have a sealed copy of windows 1.0 wow. In the computer history museum. Says my name underneath it in San Francisco outside of San Francisco. Outside of mountain view. Well that's actually pretty cool though. That's history. That's like an ancient leather bound book that Ben Franklin Rhoda and I thought it was kind of cool.

Speaker 3:          01:50:32       It's pretty cool. Yeah. I've got an old windows nt that's still in the box in my house. 3.1141 probably. I don't know what the a, the number is, but it was around windows m e cause I remember uh, as making game computers and I didn't like windows emmy. Ah, it's the worst. Yeah it was. It was sucky. And so, uh, I had some friends that went with nt but the problem was you would have issues with certain drivers for video cards and you have to be like really hip on the forums and make sure you get on a irt and Erc and find out where the uh, the best drivers are and how to Super Geeky days. Yeah. There was like certain resolutions you couldn't run things out was everything that he had to file a format with the NTSF file system. Remember that IRC was always weird to so strange cause you could send files to each other.

Speaker 3:          01:51:24       It's like IRC. Such a strange message sort of distribution. The original hashtags where an IRC, do you remember that? You could do like pound a channel? I can eat anything. That's right. This is all from my quake playing days. So that was how clans would communicate with each other. Yeah. The quake teams would call each other clans. First People look, you were in the club now the clan like tribe, like you know, team that competes, realize that they did call it cleanse back then. Yeah. The comb quake clans. Yeah. It's so crazy. Yeah. You make that connection. I was in a clan to yeah, well I was in a car. Crazy. They called it that. Yeah. The, you know, um, and we would go to these, uh, IRC channels and we'd have like a window open, like a lot of guys would run two screens.

Speaker 3:          01:52:07       So you'd run a one screen where your video games playing and then you'd have another screen next to that separate, which was your IRC channel. Right. And so you'd be communicating with each other and you had Iq, remember the instant messenger? Yeah. Well Icq, I see the little flower. The green flag. Yeah. That was awesome. And so you could send each other a little icq messages while the mass was going on. Super Geeky. Dude. This is Geeky as it gets. I mean, this was like nineties yeah. Right. So like this is stay at this. This is how deep I was into it. I lived in the mountains like kind of high up in the hills of the Santa Monica Mountains and I couldn't get good Internet access the best I could get with isd n right. Couldn't get um, cable. Couldn't get cable modem out there. It's fucking terrible.

Speaker 3:          01:52:51       The pings were awful to everywhere. So I had a t one line installed. Oh, you must've been rich. I was rich. It does. Very expensive with deep. Yeah. But it was worth it to me. It's a 1.44 megabit line. Yeah. It was worth 10 grand a month. It was worth it. That's, did you really buy a t one line pass? I had installed in my house. How did you get the, how could you he was on TV. Oh, you're doing TV stuff? I was on TV. Wow. So it was like, look, I could a TV money blows money on coke and hookers or a t one line stall t one line in my house. The people at the whatever the fucking company I called this do it 18 to year, whoever did it, they were like, what did they have to lay like fiber to get to your head to do it to this place, to this place.

Speaker 3:          01:53:38       We had dog shit Internet. When we first moved into this place, they had a chew up the fucking sidewalk out front because I was like, this is not going to happen. It was way more expensive to put it in here. This was a drag. It's like, what did it say? Four months. More than four months to get like real, but we have a hundred and a hundred down. Wow. Dedicated on. It's fat. It's a, it's an awesome pipe. But when we first moved here, we had DSL. It was dog shit and it's just, there's certain things that you just can't fuck around with. You know, Internet is definitely one of them. And when you're addicted, completely dictated eight to 10 hours a day playing quake and you go, oh, there's a solution there. What is the solution? It's a t one line. Let's do that. You know, a lot of people got Trent reznor was addicted to that for a long time. Quick. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:54:24       Well it's amazing. It's, and I can't even fuck with it today. I just don't have any time. I have children. I have too many different jobs. I just can't go near it. I can't. Yeah. But I'm sure that if I just fucking blew a fuse one night and uh, drank too many jolt cola us and sat down in front of my computer and decided to go online and place of death matches, I would get right back in. And just like a dude who has an rubber band off his arm and shot that heroin is for awhile I'd get right back into it. Man. Don't do it. It's slippery slope. I won't, I won't. I refuse. But the new games, the graphics are so fucking incredible. It's almost worth it. What is this doing multiplayer trailer that just popped out? Whoa. Oh my God. Look at this fast running around.

Speaker 3:          01:55:11       So people are complaining about how the play is company cause it's that old school the way doom used to. Exactly. Well, that's the way it's supposed to be. Like what are they complaining about this? Because it will be fast and stuff like that. Oh, cause they're pussies. They wanted, yeah. They want the fucking people to move like real people. That's retarded. Oh yeah. Look at this. You turn into a monster and start fucking people up when you owe this, you bite people's heads off. When does this come out? It's awesome. All right. I just changed my opinion. I'm in. I'm back in. I'm going to keep making you use the controllers though. Like I'm the expert. I can't either. Useless. I need a mouse and a keyboard. That's the only way to do it. Look at this guy. He's fighting the devil. He just punted punching the devil in his fucking face.

Speaker 3:          01:55:50       Now he has the devil power. Oh Jesus Christ. This is amazing. You have a c? I'm not interested in grabbing people and ripping them apart. I want to shoot him. It looks dope though. Death match like one on one death matches with that will be pretty fucking incredible. He had the perfect setup here for a land party. Don't say it. Stop. I'm just saying stop. We still land parties. Back in the 1990s we used to all meet in Houston. Those were a bunch of my friends. Where are we going to be seeing over the link them all together and have zero ping. That's just the greatest thing ever. The most. The most brutal thing we would do though. My friend Chad, he was, uh, he had some sort of a tech job, I forget what it was, but he had access to his company's board room and we'd set up everything up in this board room and these giant tables and shit. And then we would start a server and then other people would join it, but they had lag and we didn't have any lag. Just waste them. So sweet. So it's just like, you know, shooting chickens and a barrel. Yeah, fish in a barrel or whatever it is.

Speaker 3:          01:56:56       It's probably also equally easy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it just, after a while, but then the worst thing is like you would find someone who would kick your ass even though you know they had 50 paying and zero, you're like, oh, well great. Who is the best player ever. What was the mortal? Yes. I had him, he was on the screen savers on techtv back in the day when I was on there and I played against him. Yeah, it's thrash, thrash. Next level with immortal was as well. There's a bunch of different guys. Who's thresh? There was fatality totalities the one that died. He was really good. Yeah. Jonathan Window, I think his name is. I met that dude in Vegas. He's a great guy. Super Nice Guy. Yeah. He, I think he plays regular games now too, but there was a kid before him, um, uh, name that his nickname was thresh and he sort of got out of the competitive game thing and got into online websites like reviewing games and game websites and the business of it.

Speaker 3:          01:57:51       He's just started to stop playing and competing. But there's a bunch of those guys. Yeah, I played a few of them online. Just got to fucking, just decimate. Yeah. Fatality had his own motherboard. I had his mouse that was like the equivalent of like being like a signed by like a skateboarder and something like that. There it is. Yes. A totality. There he is up in the upper left hand side. That would have been my dream back in the day to have my face on a motherboard box. So good. I wonder what he's doing these days. I wonder what he must be involved in something. It's what it says is twitch. He's got a channel. Is that what it is? Yeah. These guys, they play games on twitch and they make money playing games. People watching them. It's a good life. Well, some people have these channels where they play on twitch and they have hundreds of thousands of people that are following them and watching them and they're playing 40,000 people might be watching them play a fucking game at the same like,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       I mean you've seen the stadiums in Korea. Yes. That's nuts. The starcraft, right? Yeah. Starcraft, I think it is. Fuck man. See that's not interesting to me though. Starcraft is boring to me. I understand it, but it's like chess. I'm, I'm sure it's fascinating to Pli. I love those games. It was, that was my bread and butter right there, like command and conquer. And those those. But yeah, it is like chess and it's too much about build order now. It's like you have to really get your build order down and just go really fast up front. What's the build order? What does that mean? It just means that like, you know, you put your power plant first before your weapons plant, before your turret. It's like you have to know your order and once you build things and then you adjust that based on what the they're bringing against you. So if they're trying to rush you right away, you want to get tour, it's a first look at that. Oh, that's the same as this weekend at the MLG tournament. That's where this is. Oh my God. Oh my God. This is like 15,000 people in dollar tournament. I think my, no, that's insane. All those dorks. How many of those guys have ever gotten lane five? Raise your hand.

Speaker 1:          01:59:46       It'd be fun just to go to one of those to go to one of them as a reporter, I would like to interview those guys. I saw that the uh, the rock was back in the ww wwe, he was just back in, it will wrestlemania like a few days ago. I wanted to go do that would be fun. If you've ever been to a wrestlemania. Oh No. It's like a male soap opera. You just go there and you drink beer and you yell and then you leave. I mean, you know, just to experience it one time, I'm not into it. I don't know the characters. I don't watch it ever. But just to go and experience that kind of environment, it's not interesting to me, but I get it. I get how it would be interesting, but you got to think that like, I'm already, Whoa, what's that?

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       How many people are there? Yes. It was the record. What? The hundred thousand wrestling, fake wrestling. Fake it. Fake wrestling. Oh, 100,000 people. Oh my God. You know, that's the arena that the UFC has been hoping forever to do an event in, but we would have to have some crazy, unbelievable card to fill that place up. Oh my God. Can you believe that many people go and the tickets were 500 to 3000 that's incredible. It's like basically like the super bowl, the amount of money they must've made from that fucking thing's insane. And it's all fake. Yup. I mean, not that they're not athletes. So there's those things are serious athletes, athletes, acrobats. I mean Cirque de Solei. It's fake too. Yeah. And that way it's not an unimpressive, it's very impressive. Yeah. I just, you know, thought of the slaves fake, but I, you know, I do commentary for mma. So for me that the reality of MMA is so intense and so it's so powerful that like, I can't, I just, I've seen much. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       that's fair. It's like a phase one guy going down. I'm like, I can't, like, I'm more going for the, I'm not actually like into watching dad as much as it would be just the environment in general. I guess. I go into a monster truck rally. I'd love to do that as well. I don't want to do that either. Definitely not hanging after the show. People good to cry all together. We can make you cry over that fist bump and fucking go our separate ways. Empty and talk shadow. In other words, we're getting a separate cars and even like rustling, he said fucking cry. Those fake. Yeah. I uh, I mean, I get it. I understand it. I just, it's not, there's not enough time in the day. I know. I mean, if you, if I, I, that's why I don't follow baseball, basketball, football or hockey as people try to talk to shit a game and I go, no, no, look at me like I just sucked a hundred dicks.

Speaker 3:          02:02:31       Like, no, look man, I don't have to walk like what you like. Right, okay. Just because you guys were all in the football. You didn't watch the super bowl. No, I didn't want you to superbowl. Yeah. Was that okay? I never watched the superbowl. It's probably a good time day to go out and get shit done. It's, I was at Disneyland. We always get emt. People caught on, used to be used to be back in the day is to take the kids on Disneyland was a good one. Um, some Jewish holidays. We're good. Yeah, he definitely wouldn't get like you'd eliminate like 99% of the Jewish people. So that would be a good, like 30% of the people at the park or whatever it fuck it would be. You can catch like days like that. Like if you're, if you want to go to Disneyland, it's probably a good idea to plan.

Speaker 3:          02:03:10       You got to look really plot that thing out, right. Because if you try to go on like a normal day in the summer or something like that, good fucking luck. It hasn't been easy land forever. It's awesome. Is it though they have this new star distinguish rod. How do you what? Either Quito, Turkey legs. You do Turkey legs there. Yeah. You're saying, dude, I'm disciplined. I full Kido now I can, well I did a little cheat and when I was in Mexico I had some uh, tortillas, but that was still around. Yeah. But I did it just because I was on vacation. I was like, I'm, I'm going to enjoy myself for a few days and then get right back onto it. But I like the effect of it. It definitely a noticeable effect on the way I look and noticeable effect in the way I feel.

Speaker 3:          02:03:55       And I think there's some undeniable cognitive benefits as far as like the clarity of your mind. Like you don't feel foggy and tired. And I was like, I'm just sticking with this. Yeah. And plus I bring, I don't have any here. Well this is the, this is just some cream. This is Quito cream run to try to get me on this stuff, man. That's stuff's not, that's not, wait, I had this one. It is sweet. It's got the Stevia in it. That was, is that the one? That's the one I gave it to her. I gave that shit to her. Um, I also gave her some Quito Ios, which is something you that he'd dumped in water it same company right now it's a different company, but it's a ketones. Um, but exogenous ketones are good. Yeah. It doesn't kill Canada. Quito can is great.

Speaker 3:          02:04:36       I have that stuff that's good to like keep you going. And then there's, um, dom d'agostino who's where, one of the reasons why I was first intrigued by the Ketogenic Diet. I'm listening to him on a Tim Ferriss podcast. So if you haven't heard it, dom's awesome, amazing, super fucking smart guy and so dedicated to the pros and the benefits of a ketogenic diets and staying in Ketosis. So I was like, well, this guy is obviously on the fucking ball. I've got, I've got to really look, look into this. There's gotta be something to this. And so for me there was a few like undeniable benefits. One of the big ones is the way I feel in between meals. Huge. Oh yeah. There's not any type of crash. Have a constant energy. Well, not only that, the constant energy or the know crash is good, but also my hunger is not the same.

Speaker 3:          02:05:24       Like I would get fucking famished where I would eat something and then four hours later, five hours away when I was ready for my next meal, I would be famished where my body was crashing at all my God, I have to fucking eat. I literally don't get like that anymore. It doesn't happen. So I recognize that I'm hungry. I realized that I should probably get some food in me, but I'm not, I'm not compromised. And in that state, I can still have a very good workout. Right. Which when I was on a carbohydrate, glucose based system, my body was just not operating like that. I would, I would have a shit workout if I was tired and I hadn't eaten anything. I would have to have some fruit before I worked at. Right. And so those two benefits, but the big one was, um, the way my brain works, it just feels, it feels less foggy.

Speaker 3:          02:06:09       Yeah. It's a cleaner state, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's undeniable also that eating all those carbohydrates has an effect on your insulin sensitivity. And you know, your body's just processing a fuckload sugar. You're all that bread and pasta and all that stuff. It's a lot of sugar. And if you are blowing it out all day, if you're some crazy fucking ultra marathon runner or some, some dude who's doing crossfit four hours a day or something like that, you'd probably get away with it. You know, again, probably be fine, but I think there's some real benefits to staying in Ketosis.

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       Yeah, I, I've, I got really hooked on it so much so that I was testing my blood probably three to four times a day, which you fine. I was just testing after I would eat certain foods. So you know, I would, I would go in and say okay, I am, you know, two and a half millimolar is right now keep telling wise if I have a big salad, but I put a ton of fat in there as well. Will I stay in Ketosis? Like pushing the edges to see what we kicked me out. Right. So you know, I, one thing I did find is I, I like to have a glass of wine or two with dinner and so I really wanted to see what wine we do with ketosis knocks you right out of it. Right. You know what, actually I'm a really dry champagne. I could stay in, which is weird because you wouldn't think champagne would keep you and you think like something with a, it has definitely. It has to be on the drier side, but I was thinking initially like a, a red wine would keep me in more than say like a

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       champagne. I would, I would drop down, but I'd still be, you know, around 0.8 to 1.2, somewhere around there. Do you worry about that? Do you check that on a regular basis or do you just go on the way you feel? Uh, primarily in the way I feel. I could always tell when I got kicked out, I could tell when I ate something I shouldn't, you know, I'd be out and about and it would sneak up on me. You know, you'd have like a salad with like some kind of dressing that I wasn't sure of, but it doesn't taste too sweet. And then all of a sudden I would get this really bad crash if I got fully kicked out of Ketosis. Yeah. Wow. You must be like super sensitive. I was super since, but I would also get pretty deep pretty easily. Like I could fast and get up into two and a half, three millimeters within 24 hours.

Speaker 3:          02:08:21       Um, I had a real problem with those God damn blood meters. Why? Because the things that they use to prick your skin don't get through my skin just said it's like a level eight or whatever. I had to take it out of the thing and stab myself. Yeah, that's weird. I lift so much kettlebells that my, my skins are all, it's all calloused and thick. Right. So I'd like try to get in there and I was going to actually go with the top of my skin, you know, like maybe that's the better way to do it, but it just seemed so fucking gross. So I've tried it all over the place. I've done it on the sides before. What's the best way for you? Uh, for me it's, it is the tips of the fingers, but like, you know, it's kind of Russian roulette like one and I've ever, 10 is going to hurt.

Speaker 3:          02:08:59       So when you're doing it like five times a day, you would always kind of try and yeah, different spots. You know, it got annoying. I was like, this is annoying. Jab Myself. Cause I had, I used to try the punch thing and it just wasn't doing anything right. I would go right to the tip chunk. Did you squeak Bush even when you were at that thing? Huh? But is years of, you know, lifting? I like kettle bells or just so it's a fat piece of iron and your hands. Are you just constantly getting roughed up and I'm using powder right on chalk. So it's was all this grit. It's all very thick. It's like the coding. It's like the bottom of your feet stand on top doing the top stair. Is there a better way? I mean there's the piece takes, but they don't really didn't work that well.

Speaker 3:          02:09:43       Um, but you know, for someone like yourself that's falling a pretty strict diet than just once a day is fine, just check it, check it first thing in the morning and don't check it anymore. Yeah, it doesn't matter if you know you're in your end, you'll feel it. Well, I always feel like, look, what am I eating? I mean eggs and Avocados and meet, and I know what I'm eating and I'm not, I just want to feel like I'm feel right now, like if I could just keep this whatever this is. Yeah. This is great. You know? I mean, I don't want to, I don't want anything that I would have to obsess on. Right. Oh my God, I'm in 2 million molar is I'd like to be at three I, how do I get to three? Well, I'll have to eat, drink fucking gallon mct. Oh, now I've got to shit my pants. It's right. Yeah. For me it was like, okay, what is going to kick me out? Just so I know the boundaries and once I have the boundaries that I'm fine, I didn't need to do it anymore. So like, you know, I know that I can have, you know, a half a cup of brown

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       rice along with some fatty foods and it's not going to really do anything. So it's like, I just wanted to see it as a cup kicked me out. Oh yeah, I kept does. Okay, dial it back, you know, that kind of thing. Right? And when you get kicked out, how long does it take you to recover? A half day. Half Day. Half to three quarters of a day. Intermittent fast at all. Oh yeah. And how, how many hours do you do? A 16 hours. 16, 12. And I guess it's not enough. I'll do 24 a couple of times a month. Real? Yeah. Two, three times a month. And why do you do it? Just because I keep, you know, he listened to ron as podcast and she starts talking about like all the guests that she has. I'm like doctor, dom and others. Um, you know, when they talk about how if you're doing a full 24 hour fast, like it can actually help clear out the non precancerous cause kind of cells. They haven't fully gone cancer. And then interesting. It's crazy, but why not? You know, it's like this is something fascinating. Been around for a, a obviously a very long time. It also puts me in a nice kind of meditative state. Um, you know, it's, I interviewed the trainer. I haven't released as podcasts yet, but I enter interviewed the trainer for Hugh Jackman that helped him get shredded revolver. He did tell you about the steroids. Uh, he did not tell me about this.

Speaker 3:          02:11:46       Oh, well he didn't tell you everything then. Yeah, he definitely told me about the intermittent fast about the steroids. Is this real? I'm a hundred percent confident that that guy did steroid. How do you know? Look at his body. He's fucking jacked. Hugh Jackman got fucking jacked and he's 40 years old. You don't think he got checked? Well, I mean, well, it depends on what kind of, I'm sure that he was on a wonderful diet. He was on a wonderful diet, intermittent fasting. He was without a doubt, manipulating these hormones. What do you think he was using? I know friends that have done movie rules. Look at him. Come on, son. Shit. That's a lot of photoshop. Photoshop, that's a skill that might be a still, but the, this is scene in the movie where he gets up out of bed and he is fucking jacked. I mean, is it possible to get that big without steroids?

Speaker 3:          02:12:33       If you're 20 yeah, yeah. It war. If you are a fucking maniac and your 30 and you're in the gym all day long and you're completely and totally dedicated. Yeah, it's possible. But it's not likely. But I have a friend who was a, he was doing, he's a movie actor and he was doing a role and in the role he had to be jacked and they just, without any, they just come in. Yeah. We have a guy, we have a guy and this guy's gonna hook you up and if you follow his protocol, she's just gonna it'll be healthy. It's like, well, this what we're gonna do. We're gonna, you know, do this and do that and add this and that. And he was like, whoa. And uh, you know, it's, it's really kind of in some sort of a weird gray area. You know, it's, there's some stuff that you, first of all, there's some stuff that you can get at like Gnc and some of those places where it is steroids.

Speaker 3:          02:13:24       Really. Yes. Like what stuff? Well, fucking shitload of them. We had Jeff Novitsky who was the guy who busted Lance Armstrong and he works for the UFC now. He works for Usada and he um, they have a website and then the youth side of website, there's all these different supplements that contain products that are illegal products that will get you kicked out because they are steroids in their performance enhancing drugs while you, the u s Ada website has like, you know, alphabetically listed a through z and each letter has just fucking shit loads of different supplements that you could buy at any store and he local vitamin Shoppe that is likely to be filled with steroids. That's crazy. Well there's this stuff that I take, I took it in like the early two thousands was called Mag 10. They, they made it illegal. After awhile it was 100% steroids.

Speaker 3:          02:14:20       I mean 100%. This has to be really bad for your liver then since all most of them are not good. But you know, when you see someone did gets that Jack for a movie, why would they be concerned with not doing it the right way? Like if the, what's the, what's the goal here? The goal here is you have to look like a goddamn superhero. Right? Okay. So are you pr, are you prepared to not totally looked like a superhero and tell everybody, but at least I did it naturally. Right? Fuck that. No, they're going to, they're going to do dead lifts on testosterone and take human growth hormone and the reward is pretty high too. And that you get paid $15 million or whatever it is for any looked awesome. I mean I'm not hating it at all, but anyone who thinks you're going to achieve that kind of results without some sorts, especially like, like I said, like how old you Jackman isn't he like 40 it's like 42 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:15:12       I mean it's, there are some outliers, there are some people that mean, but in the UFC when you find these guys and they just look unbelievable, they like unbelievably ripped and huge and they get into their late thirties and then they get popped and then some on the, some of the, they just randomly test them and then eat. Cause w the way that UFC is set up now with Novitsky, they'll show up at your house at six o'clock in the morning, wake up, dude, wake up dude. Yeah, we need some blood to p crazy. And then they test them. And then, you know, there's a lot of these guys that are on something that hasn't, it's insanely short half life. Like they'll have something that a is only a shows up in the system for like seven hours. So what they'll try to do is they'll try to take it like right before they go to bed and then we'll get the benefits of it and then, but they'll fucking wake you up, man.

Speaker 3:          02:15:56       They'll wake you up. That's insane. Well, it's because they want to find out what's going on and we've exposed, or I shouldn't say we have nothing to do with it, but they've exposed, uh, tremendous underlying sort of just a standard operational procedure of testosterone, steroids, all, all sorts of different ways of manipulating the system. Epo, that stuff that Armstrong got caught with or actually didn't, he never got caught with anything. Right. He had to confess. That's right. But a lot of those cyclists take epo, which jacks up your red blood cell production. There's just so many different ways of enhancing the way the body functions both naturally, you know, like with Ketosis and a lot of other methods and you know, and then with exogenous chemicals, did you see the documentary on steroids? Which one? Bigger. Stronger, faster. I had those guys here. It would you think that's great.

Speaker 3:          02:16:48       It's interesting. It is interesting. I've become friends with those guys. Um, and um, it's just when you find out what, you know, how many different different types of steroids there are and how many different people and totally different athletes are taking them and you like, especially throughout bodybuilding and things. I mean if you can call that a sport, I guess you can. It's kind of an activity more than it is a sports kind of dying out though. I feel like is it at least the, the crazy, I had a buddy that they competed, um, and he was definitely choosing, uh, and he was, he said that the big bulky kind of crazy over the top look and they're going more for a more natural appearance. That's kind of the hot thing now. Like Frank Zane or something like that. Yeah. Frank Zane was famous in the arnold days as being like the most symmetrical and also like the more realistic, like as close to like a Lee Haney who is just just walking mass of muscle.

Speaker 3:          02:17:45       Right. Whereas Zane was more, it looked more sculpted. It will look more like a, you have a photo of them there. Oh, Jesus. Who's that guy? Oh yeah, he was on what touch point. Oh, oh yeah. Well this guy is a crazy guy. He's sort of a bodybuilder, but more of like a personality. He has an eight hour arm workout where he works out nothing but his arms for eight hours. Wow. His arms are massive. Yeah. He's everything massive. He's is a cartoon. There's definitely some drugs there. No way, dude. That's totally legit. Yeah, no, he's, he's brought it to the tits. Um, but lou, Google, Frank Zane, and you'll get an idea of what a lot of people thought was like one of the perfect bodies. So like Frank Zane, I firmly believe that that is a body that is possible. You can attain that body without steroids with strong dedication and good, uh, knowledge of nutrition and the right way to lift weights.

Speaker 3:          02:18:44       But Frank Zane never got ridiculously big like that is a regular size guy out a lot of gyms like right there, right. That's a regular size guy. And a lot of like high level gyms like that might not even be the biggest guy there. It looks like there's drugs there though, right? I mean, the shoulders are popped maybe most likely, probably. I Dunno. Um, no, that's attainable, man. Yeah, that's a terrible without drug little lines. But that just means he's a very lean it those little lines. Striations. That's totally attainable. Without drugs. There's a level, I mean, you'd have to be really dedicated to training, but he's, he's not, he's not that big man in comparison to some of the people of today. Now look at him. Okay. Now Google Dorian Yates, Dorian Yates who was a fucking, and he's or Dorian is a really interesting guy because he's super honest about it. Like that one right there, right? No to the left of that right there. What in the fucking Christ look out. That's insane. That's all drugs and dedication and focus and lifting a 100% I mean, you don't have, you just took Jay counselor. You've seen Jay Cutler's legs, right? Yeah. Type in Jay Cutler that those guys are ridiculous. Yeah. Or Tom Platz ever seen that guy's legs. Tom Platz has the most ridiculous legs ever.

Speaker 3:          02:20:10       Jesus Christ. I can't. I just got some. Yeah, that's all like horses. I mean, you have to be a maniac in the gym on top of the log of that fucking picture. That's insane. Yeah. I mean, I think this is also, this is also like a mass movement of body dysmorphia because it's not just that these guys are trying to get as big as they can. I don't think they see themselves the way other people see them either. Cause like sometimes they freak out when they're not in perfect shape and they want to cover their bodies up with sweaters and stuff and they don't want anybody looking at them. It's like an anorexia thing in a way, but it's still like better than 99.9% of humans on earth, even when they're not in peak shape. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, but to them, you know, they're, they're used to judging each other.

Speaker 3:          02:20:58       So harsh, laid, they have a little bit of extra body fat. They start to freak crazy. Yeah. I mean back to Hugh Jackman and this, uh, this training thing. Yeah. I mean I think that's, it's a fantastic way to get your body really lean. And that's one of the things he was in that movie was super lean. Yeah. So he was on a ketogenic diet. He was doing the intermittent fasting. And so he was doing 16 hours a day, every day, every day. Hmm. Interesting. And then on a ketogenic diet as well as I know about that. No, I don't think he was saying Kenogenic. Hmm. And what was the benefit of doing that 16 hour fasting without a key leading up. Just leaning up. Hmm. I would wonder if that would affect without getting your body into a state of ketosis. I wonder if that would affect the way your body put on muscle mass.

Speaker 3:          02:21:41       Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't know enough about this. You know, there's also a problem that for the longest time doctors were calling bullshit on fasting and they just didn't have a lot of information. But they were like so quick to poo poo it and like, you know, like fasting has no med. I remember this guy telling me this, he was a doctor goes, fasting has no medical benefits. Your body exists on nutrients and when you deny your body nutrients and you think you're somehow under their cleansing, your system is just a bunch of bunk. Meanwhile, he was wrong. Right? And he's a fucking doctor. That means almost all doctors are five, 10 years behind the science though, right? Um, a lot of them, well the, the thing is how much education did they actually have on nutrition, right. And two hours that it's really small.

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       It is like that it's like, you know, a quarter of a semester or something like that. Something really, so when you're talking to an oncologist and the oncologist starts poopooing the value of phytonutrients and certain vitamins to combat cancer and he doesn't stay on top of the cutting edge of it. I mean, people are so weird with what they know that they believe that what they know is all there is out there. Right. Like I had a discussion with this woman and she just did, she was, um, we were talking about um, uh, this animal that they found the Congo, it's called the Bondo ape. It's like this enormous chimpanzee documented like hundred percent. They have DNA photos, camera trap pictures of it. They have, they've got the skull of it, they know it's real animal. And this woman was like, try it. She was mocking it.

Speaker 3:          02:23:16       She was mocking it. Like, what could kind of fringe things. I went to school for anthropology. Like I go, oh well you're obviously not on the ball. Like maybe you went to school 20 years ago. And then I told her, go, go google it. Go Google, check it these websites. And she was like, I'm not going to, I go, you're not going to, I'll, but I'll do it in front of you and then will you shut the fuck up and I show you photos cause this is giant chimpanzee that they found this one rare area of the Congo that's of really old photo though, man. That's one of the phones. That's a better photo look at the size of that fucking chimp. I mean that thing is goddamn huge. They have a, there's a guy named Carl Amon who's a Swiss wildlife photographer who set up some camera traps and he got a picture of one of them walking, standing on the side, the balls on that huge nuts.

Speaker 3:          02:24:03       Huge. And that's not even a good picture. That's a kind of a blurry picture. There's some better ones have it. But, um, it's an enormous chimp, it's a like a subspecies that, uh, turns out to be, uh, enjoys walking upright as well. They see the far right far right upper upper deck. Yeah, that's the camera trap photo. That's one of them walk, go full screen on that, uh, does work. That's one of 'em walking upright and they said that fucking thing was six feet tall. Like that is an enormous chimpanzee. But the point is this woman who said she went to school for anthropology was mocking this when we were talking about it and I was like, look, I'm telling you, I mean, it's not something I'm making up. I'm not going to fucking cryptozoology.com like this is national geographic. This was, you know, like there's a bunch of different scientists that are studying this thing and trying to find out how many of them there are and they don't have any of them in captivity. They don't know how many there are. And it's a really dangerous part of the Congo where it's warlords and fucking, you know, shootings and killings and rapings. It's like he's a very dangerous spot to get to and they're really, but the point being when someone gets a certain amount of information on a subject and then they don't stay up on it and they still want to cling to that old information, like this is all there is like you do a real disservice to the other people that you

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       to be the one who's the voice of information. Absolutely. Yeah. The fascinating thing is a, I think it's starting to come around though. I have a buddy that just, I'm just beat cancer. He was a stage three lymphoma. Whoa. And he went in for his first chemo treatments and you know, you just get totally sick when you're doing chemo. And there was some research that come out and talk about fasting prior to chemo and how it helps with the, with the therapy. So he started fasting two days prior to doing chemo. So you do 48 hours and then go into chemo and world of difference. And so it was this doctor, um, put out a bunch of papers and you can even watch the videos on youtube of these rats fasting prior to chemo and that the difference between the fast and group in the non fasting group is like night and day. The group that fast, it is like running around, eating, drinking afterwards, like after they had the chemo treatment, the other group is just on its side like deathly ill.

Speaker 3:          02:26:19       Wow. That's really crazy. That's amazing. There's benefits going into chemo too, which is, Rhonda was talking about that. She was talking about Doctor Rhonda. Patrick was talking about that there's some pretty significant benefits, not just for combating cancer but also for dealing with chemo. It's just amazing how many tinkers there are out there. Like Dr Dom D'agostino guys who are just super fucking smart but also tweaking their own body. Like

Speaker 1:          02:26:47       if you had Peter Attia on the show yet. No, he's, he's another one that, uh, what's his law? Dr Peter Attia. How do you spell it? Uh, I'd have to look it up. Att I, Yay. Yay. So that he's been on a Tim ferriss show. He's another body hacker slash kido person. Really, really smart guy. He was just on, Rhonda is a podcast as well. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          02:27:07       I'll find them. There's so many of those people out there and I know these doctors that are also into physical fitness and you know, exercise is like, one of the things about a Tim Ferriss podcasts was dom d'agostino talking about fasting for five days. Then doing like 500 pounds of dead lifts. Just insane. It's like what? So crazy he would think of someone who hadn't eaten in five days. It just being a barely alive thing clinging to life, you know? Yeah. It's um, it's really fascinating how we're learning also that the body has a bunch of different ways that it can acquire food, that it can acquire food through carbohydrates or fuel rather through carbohydrates or through fat, you know, or, and it can go back and forth in between those things and just the reaction that your body has that we think is normal to common everyday foods that are just really fucking terrible for you.

Speaker 3:          02:27:55       But we all eat them, you know? And you know, he could deal occasionally every now and then. But I didn't when I, um, when I really committed to it was when I met Mark Sisson and I did the podcast with him and I really started talking about the, when he really started talking about the benefits of it and I just decided, well, it's worth a shot. Let me just give it a shot. And within five or six days, I knew that this was going to be probably the way I eat for the rest of my life. And

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       one of the things that really hit me was how bad I felt when I wasn't taking in sugar for a few days. And I was like, God, have I got a headache? I feel like shit. And I realized, Oh, my body is addicted to this crap. Absolutely. Sugar is the devil. It's so bad for us. I mean, just, I, I'm sure you keep up with the data as well, but just like every, it feels like every few months was another report that comes out and talks about how toxic and evil it is. But it's so yummy. It is. Yummy. What have a fucking weird biological trick. Yeah, but we never used to eat it like that. We didn't refine it to the level that we do now. Well, it's still, I mean, you know what's interesting too, is it sugar is yummy and ice cream is delicious, but fruit, fruit is like one of the best tasting things you can get your hands on.

Speaker 1:          02:29:09       Like if you have a nice ripe peach is one of the most fantastic things in so underappreciated, so underrated, you know, like that is the way you're supposed to get your sugar. It's really the only way. Like if you really want sugar, you're really supposed to eat like a fresh orange. Right. And they taste amazing. Like that should be our dessert every night. You know? It's like, it's just as good as chocolate cake. It really is. It's just you have it in your head. The chocolate cake is that dessert. You know that frosting and look at it, it's moist. I love chocolate and I've started to eat 100% chocolate, so no sugar added. But here's the funny thing, the 100% chocolate that you've ever tasted or anyone else out there has ever tasted is the baker's chocolate. It's the stuff that you get at the store and it's made exclusively for baking.

Speaker 1:          02:29:58       It's super bitter and harsh and nasty and burnt. And the reason I was talking to a chocolate maker, this guy that owns a fruition chocolate out in New York, and he said, well, they just beat the hell out of it. Like they overwrote it. They don't, it's not for consumption like that. So they don't care. He makes a hundred percent chocolate bar that is actually palatable. Like it's, it's, it's a ship. What's it do? They ship, ship, ship, what's the name of the company? Fruition. Fruition. And they make 100%, uh, no sugar added chocolate bar. And I do, you know, like a little quarter piece of that. And it's just, you feel amazing. Chocolate is a great, it's a great little pick-me-up. Has a little bit of caffeine in there as well. Well, that's why it's bad for dogs. Yes, yes, it, it, I had to have my dog's stomach pumped.

Speaker 1:          02:30:44       I'm dead serious. It's horrible. My, my poor little labradoodle. Let's gone through raccoon attack and everything else. We live of those. Sweet, sweet. Oh my God, he's so friendly. We left a, I'm one of those uh, chocolate bars, the whole foods like dark chocolate, like 80% and he just, we came home in the rappers like all over the floor and I'm like, oh my God. It's like I called, I called the vet, they're like, bring him in right away. Brought him down there two days in the hospital on Ivy. Whoa. Like six times the lethal dose or something like that. I mean, he's a small little labradoodle. And did they put charcoal in the stomach and we had to give him charcoal afterwards. Towels really brutal. Well apparently just jacks your little hearts. Like that's what kills him. The little harder. Do seizures and they have all that.

Speaker 1:          02:31:34       So it's really bad. And chocolate chocolate. That's like the only saving grace of like a Hershey's or something. They're not really chocolate anymore. They're like 2% or whatever. You know when dogs, when when I called they're like, well what type of chocolate? You know like, cause if it's like a Hershey's bar, they didn't want me. They're like, oh he might throw up but be, well I don't know if it's Hershey's bars, but you know what I mean. Like the lesser like almost all sugar bars with milk don't have a ton of chocolate. Not like an 80% dark, organic, free trade artists, anal bar from whole foods. It's a whole nother level that's, that's a real chocolate.

Speaker 3:          02:32:11       Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a good chocolate though. I love those things. A little cocoa nibs, you know, the little nibs. Tasty. Yummy. Yeah. I tried to, I'm just trying to avoid everything. Sweet. Other than fruit. Yeah. My, so you do fruit in Ketosis? Well it will not be sharing out. I'll do blueberries. Mangos occasionally they knock you out, it'll definitely knock you out. But it's not as bad as refined sugar though. It's fruit, fruit toast versus secrets. Right, right. But see, I'm not necessarily a hundred percent concerned with getting knocked out. My concern was like what is the, what is the Diet that my body functions the best on? How do I feel when I work out? How do I feel? Like just throughout the day and for me, no sugar. That's the big one. Avoid all that. No Pasta, no bread, cut all that stuff out and uh, no rice.

Speaker 3:          02:33:05       When I do this, do that. I, it doesn't seem to fuck with me too much if I have like a pear or a little bit of this, a little bit in yogurt, you know, if you have like a large bowl of yogurt and blueberries, realistically you're getting too much sugar, you know, but too much sugar for what it's not. It doesn't fuck my body up. Right. But it's gonna knock me out of Ketosis, but then I take exogenous ketones and I should do, because I want to get knocked out. I'm in a slump. He just take exogenous ketones. Casino has his own brand now, if the kid can have staff and now he has his own brand. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. Key Key technics. It can, I just bought it. I just had it delivered. I haven't tried it yet, but I've been doing Kido s which is another company, they need to come up with a seminar for these products. Like everyone's like, what's the key to Cana? I Dunno, who cares? I don't give a fuck with it. Call it is poured in the water. It's great, but they taste good. Yeah, we can't count as good.

Speaker 1:          02:33:58       But I heard some of them are really jet fuel. He Nasty.

Speaker 3:          02:34:01       Quito s is fine. I mean it's not the best taste and stuff in the world like Gatorade, but it's not awful. Right. It's fun. It's just like I said, my main concern is predominantly making sure I'm eating healthy stuff. Just making sure that I, and then I also have to really vet out some of the information when it comes to increasing the Mitochondria in your body. Like is that all real? I don't know. And I need to find the pros and cons are the detractors of these ideas because there some of the things that system was saying. There was like, Ooh, I gotta, I gotta look that up. And Kyle Kingsbury, who, a friend of mine who's a former UFC fighter is a very, very smart guy who was also been Quito for a couple of years now. I have a few friends that are athletes, like real high level athletes.

Speaker 3:          02:34:43       My friend Danny proper coast, he's a former, a Jujitsu world champion. He's been ketogenic for the past year. He's really dedicated and he takes that a Kito Kana stuff, but he's just a hundred percent convinced that's the way it's the way to go. It's funny man. How many people like fight like cats and dogs about this online? It's almost like a Mac versus pc thing, you know, I think it comes down to like, just how you, like you said, how you personally feel on it. Like for me, I was always having that, okay, you know, it's afternoon, I'm in a slump. I'm mentally a little foggy. Like, you know, I attribute a lot of that too. A lot of the refined carbs. I was eating 100% and sugar. You get rid of that stuff, uh, and you just, you're just sharper, sharp. It's like, you know, like I said about the cold therapy and the mood, the 20% boosts, it's like a 20% boost in just mental clarity and sharpness.

Speaker 3:          02:35:34       Yeah. For my own personal experience, my own experimentation, that has been the biggest factor. The biggest factor has been cutting out sugar, cutting out sugar, cutting out refined carbs, all that had a massive positive benefit. So then you know, a little fruit in a lot of the, I just don't, I think fruit is your advice though? My Vice. You have anything? Like, do you ever do pizza every once in a while? No. I mean, like I said, oh, I went a good solid 55 days strict until I went to Mexico. And then when I went to Mexico I just had some tortillas. That was it. Yeah. But even then I chip seal bet. But I tell you what, man, after I ate the Tortillas, I had some dessert there when I was there too. I felt like shit. Yeah. Boy, when you don't have it for, you know, almost two months and then you do have it.

Speaker 3:          02:36:18       Like all my God, it's like I ate a brick. Did you skyrocket out with like some kid can I like to have when he was down there and bring any with me now I just roughed it. I just decided to look, I'm going to be down here on vacation with my family. I'm just going to drink Margarita is and go fishing and have a great time. I'm like, I'm not giving a fuck about anything. I and I needed like a mental break because I do, I have like three, essentially three occupations and um, I managed them consecutively and it's, they're all fun. I enjoy them, but I think that just the sheer rpms that I'm operating at all the time needs brakes on. I'm learning as I get older to get better at just shutting all that shit down. So I'm like, I'm shutting everything down. Are you good at saying no, I'm great at setting. No, that's good. I'm good at, that's an piece of it is just saying no to a lot of things. After the last like four years, I've gotten better and better at it. I'm really good at that. I see, I say no one to like really good stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:37:17       He knows it. So why do you ever look on your calendar and think like, Oh God, I committed to that thing and I'm not anymore. I did. I used to. Yeah. That was my entire career on fear factor. It's like, fuck, how is this thing still on the air? Shit. You know, how many years was that on the air for six years? It's crazy. 148 episodes.

Speaker 3:          02:37:36       And then we came back and did it again for six more episodes. Um, but yeah, now I don't, I do it less and less now. Almost everything I do, I really, really enjoyed doing and that, that helps. That helps a lot if you can, but it's hard. It's hard, you know, for a lot of folks, that's not where their money is. Their money comes from things that make them uncomfortable. Yeah. You know, their money comes from things that they don't enjoy, but they just happened to be good at it or understand really well. It's, it's such a treat in such a huge blessing in life, although I hate that word blessing. But it's such a huge positive. If you can find something you actually enjoy and that is actually how you make your living God so lucky. So lucky to be able to do that because so few people have that where they can, the one thing that like they don't, like today, like today, my day was I worked out and I said, oh, I'm going to go talk to Kevin Rose today. This is going to be fucking awesome. I'm psyched. So that's my day, you know, I mean, there's no negative to that, you know, and then, um, you know, go have dinner and it's like all normal stuff. It's like it to, to have that as a job. It's like, it's beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:38:45       Yeah, I see that a lot. You know, I spent the last, uh, gosh, probably eight years doing technology investing, um, you know, at Google ventures and a in on my own. And, uh, the people, the entrepreneurs that go after things that they're really personally passionate about, they're the ones that actually win in the end because they just, when they have those shitty days, it's not like, ah, man, I got to give up. It's, it's their, it's their baby, it's their life's work and they can push through that. And that's, that's, I, I find that, uh, that's, that's, those are the hard moments and only the moments that you can get through if you're truly passionate and into what you're, what you're doing. Well, I have a lot of varied interests,

Speaker 3:          02:39:24       but I also have a lot of, uh, interest in other people's interests even if I'm not interested in their interests. What I mean is like if I'm listening to a guy talk, like say if he's like a, he makes custom kitchen knives like, and he's just really into it and he talks to you about this

Speaker 1:          02:39:42       of steel, it he uses and how he prepares the same way. I'm man, man, I'm in. My last podcast was interviewing the guy to talk about the absolute best paper notebooks and we geeked out for like 45 minutes on like stationary. What's the best? The best is a couple. Well, domestically and fans most get it are the worst. They're the worst. What's wrong with them? You got to listen to my podcasts. I can't do this anymore. Multiple world's filled with lies to mole skin. They source their paper from China. J A bad paper, which I was bad. The paper you write on it, you could see what you wrote. Now he goes a lot deeper than that. Anyway. Needless to say, uh, two brands out of Japan are the best. Okay. What are they a I'll forward you my, my last, it was in my, I don't, they're like mural stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:40:28       Is there any one that I can bother me? Known her in the US? So field notes, field notes are, and uh, uh, let's see. It was a, let's see, there was one other, um, it was rough. I'm going to, what's the name of the sorts of the r eight on the lovely mole skin? How can you hate on this? Look at this.

Rhodia is the one that one his best, not domestic pick or not domestic, but just one that's um, that's easy to find around very stationery shops. You know what I like to those ones with the black and white speckled covers that you buy at the supermarket? I could, oh, those old school, one of those kids are like in mead ones like the, well it's like a black band around the edge.

Speaker 1:          02:42:46       What the fuck is those are those called composition books? Composition books? Yeah. Yeah. Those are cool. Those are okay. I will. It depends on whether you want, the thing is at the end of the day, none of it matters. Like we're, we're, we're running on staples right now. Who cares if you want them to stand the test of time, if you want them to be archival quality, if you want them to work with fountain pens, it's Super Geeky. I wasn't really into this town in Penn. Lose my number. I do not have fountain pen. If you one of those guys with the fucking a feather with a jug of ink on your desk, tap, tap, tap. No, no, I'm not. I do not have a fountain path to go. I'm taking a calligraphy class at five.

Speaker 1:          02:43:25       Yeah. There's something about really nice pens that is attractive. You like to geek out and stuff. You were saying that, that's why I brought it. I'm only giving you a hard time. I'm going to get 100% of the way. I mean, I could totally geek out about paper. I Geek out about paper, about coffee stuff. Oh, like he got about coffee. Yeah. Do you do your own at home? My home. What? Pour-Over ports or pour over like where you grind your own beans and you pour water on top of it. It's always okay. Yeah. I don't know which means you have like a, like a Chemex or no, I use a French press. Okay. Let's find too, it's okay. I mean it's, it's very nineties, but that's right. It works great. I'm just kidding. It's by this Guy Peter Giuliano, who's a real legit coffee expert, travel the world. And uh, he um, you know, he said French press is what he uses. I think the aero press is great. Uh, I do the v 60, which is what you got there, Jamie. Oh, there you go. Yeah. This is a little clover station.

Speaker 3:          02:44:21       Is that from cane fan? Caveman. So Caveman coffees. So one of the companies that we work with company wow. Locally sourced, um, everything comes from Colombia. It's a single family, single origin. They uh, get it in Columbia and then they bring it to New Mexico process it, very small company. All these are made in Colombia. All this stuff here is probably made in New Mexico. It's beautiful stuff. It's awesome. Well, caveman coffees. It's a buddy of mine's company and it's, it's his passion. My friend Tate and um, uh, Keith Jardeen and Lacey Mackey, the other two people that are involved in the company and they just, it's a single origin, single family, single source company where they know the people that are grown in this coffee. They go to visits also in Columbia. It's like you're getting it from the source and when you open up the

Speaker 1:          02:45:11       bag heaven, the aroma of freshly roasted coffee and it's got a roasted date on it, you know, they'll let you know when it was, when it was picked, when it was roasted. Fantastic stuff. There's a great coffee shop that I've been to in Tokyo and it is this guy, he's, he's like a, I call him like the Gyro of Coffee Nocero this Sushi guy. So he does something, he ferments his coffee beans. So he ferments them for I think three or four months. So they're not fresh and they're really pungent and oily. And then he does a 20 minute like water pour over in front of you 20 minutes. So they don't speak English. You walk in there and all you can say the hill, understand his old beans. And then he literally sits there for 20 minutes and does the slowest drip pour-over you've ever seen in your entire life. And then it's done and he serves it to you with like two hands. Super a baby. Like

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       it's a baby. Wow. He presented with the baby. And how was it? Phenomenal. It's really good. Did you pour sugar and cream courses? Slaughter. Did I put my ketones in there? Well this is ketones. No, I know. I just, kido cream stuff is so sugar email. Well it just, it's got Stevia. They wasn't be on the show. I know, but only has four grams of sugar per share was like for me it was so sweet. When you don't have sugar for or sweets for a long time, it just like really hits Ya. Well I bought this stuff and I've never used it. It's one I was saying. So I would say Jamie, one day I'm going to use that and then I don't fucking, I just keep drinking this butter coffee. Um, have you ever had copied the walk? No. You don't know what that is?

Speaker 3:          02:46:53       Oh wait. Yeah. That's the stuff that shit's gay. I've had actually like really? Yeah, that was really good. I heard you're begin to bulletproof coffee. Well that's what this is. No, but the, the brand bulletproof. No, no, I'm just kidding. Well that turned out to be kind of, unfortunately, that's name is a great name. And Yell or Mark Formula, which was created by Robb Wolf. Really, by the way, I didn't know that. Rob Wolfe wrote about putting grass fed butter and mct oil and coffee in like 2004 or something like that. Easy. He wrote about and published it and well that's that guy's ideas. They're not all bad and some of them aren't bad at all, but the pride, one of the things that Rhonda Patrick had a correct does. He gets things wrong about the science behind things because he's sort of reciting other people's work. It's not actually doing work and he's not really a scientist when it comes to that stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:47:48       He's just a collector of ideas and then redistributes them and puts that word on them, which is fine as long as you actually hire a scientist like you know, double and triple check everything you're doing well. The motors is a brilliant marketer. Yeah. The motivation was very deceptive because is motivated. He was trying to sell everybody on this idea of mycotoxins and coffee's coming here to band is completely abandoned that. Okay. That was the one reason why you're supposed to buy his coffee as opposed to anybody else's. Completely unsubstantiated. And then we spend a shit load of money trying to find out whether or not that was true cause it's expensive to test coffee for mycotoxins. We tested all this different coffee, random coffee, you whole foods, coffee, starbucks, coffee, coffee, bean, coffee, nothing, nothing. And then the more I talked to actual coffee experts, the more they're like no, they figured out how to stop that in the 80s it's the difference between the climate in Ethiopia, which is an incredibly dry climate, which is where all coffee comes from.

Speaker 3:          02:48:43       And this is another thing that we found out from Peter Juliano. All coffee came from Ethiopia, all of it. And then they started growing it. And these other climates we can South America. When you think of Colombia and Juan Valdez and the coffee, well that coffee, the problem with that is that that's a moist environment. It's a moist green, lush environment, not dry like Ethiopia. So they would try to use this same drawing methods and it didn't work cause he's beans would get moldy and then they would develop these molds, toxins. And so that became an issue. But then they figured out a way to wet process. So the wet processing became the solution for dealing with, um, the, the mold issue. They solve that a long fucking time ago. So some of the single origins that you can buy it, some of the fancier places, uh, are still dry process. I wonder if those with eop coffees. Yeah. Ethan Coke, Ethiopian coffees are still very, very popular and really delicious. It's one of, I think Juliano brought us in was your guest chef. How do you say it? What does this stuff either Ethiopian coffee, your, your chest.

Speaker 4:          02:49:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:49:48       We're not gonna get it right. I know which of the two of us, but it was like a, almost a sweet, not sweet, but a lemony. Yeah, I've had a, Oh, it's amazing. Amazing. Really, really interesting stuff. Do you have, we have some. We might. Um, but the, the variables and the variations and flavors, I think it's really interesting how some flavors it just have like who is like bold, almost like, like dark taste to them and other ones like almost like you're drinking flowers. What are you drinking these days to you? Do you go and buy a certain brand or a caveman signs is different stuff all the time. But uh, cause it's my friend's company and I, and, and I know, I know how ethical they are and how they source it and how they have this great relationship with this farm in Columbia and it's all like direct relationship.

Speaker 3:          02:50:38       It's like it's, to me it's the easiest way to deal with it. You know, like, and they have, if you go to their website, they explain how they do everything. It's, it's just awesome. It's just the cleanest way to go about it. And they also have this nitro, this nitrogenated coffee. You ever heard of that at stumptown has a cold night. Tro. Do you want to freak out? I want to figure out right now. You want to get, feel like you want to run through a fucking wall. Give you one, 270 milligrams. Caffeine. Yeah. Do we have any handy to have like a, just a little taste or dot. Drink. A whole gallon. Yeah, man. Bring you can do, you can waste some of it if somebody's been coughing a lot more. You're already getting out a couple of the groups I've been drinking this the entire show. Yeah. We try to come up with a new name for it. Oh, sorry. His name then what do you call it? It's called butter coffee, but it's what it is. It's coffee with butter in it. Caveman nitro. It's just too bad that the guy's a dork. No offense. I should've done that in front of the mic or you could hear it.

Speaker 3:          02:51:36       But a lot of his products, a lot of those bulletproof products, it's still, it's really mild. They're still very good products like, uh, his, uh, grass fed whey and a lot of his other stuff. Nothing wrong with it. That's great coffee. That's great. Right? Yeah. 270 milligrams of caffeine in this little tiny flank. Ooh, good Lord. That's a lot. A lot. Normal Cup is like what? One 30? Um, something like that. Yeah. I think a Venti starbucks is 200. I think that's what we established. This is, I feel

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       so we're winding this bitch up. It's about to end. All right. Anything to say before we go? This is a lot of fun. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Enjoy it. Yeah. If you're ever in town, man, open invitation. Appreciate it again. I, it's, I'm a, I'm a fan watching your show. Thank you. And uh, it's cool to actually be here cause he normally see this stuff on video. It's a weird, since the space, you guys have a physically here. No, I like it. It's, it's got a good vibe to it. We've been here for a few years now. I got to eventually buy a place and move into it and try to recreate this or new, something new, I think. Maybe, but this is, this has got little Buddhas over the place. Too many Tupac. It's great. CONOR MCGREGOR, awesome. Many conor mcgregor. Many Tupac. Yeah, it's a good spot.

Speaker 1:          02:52:48       I'm enjoying it here. Um, you're not going to do your podcast anymore. You ever going to bring that back? No. Dig Nation is going to, you know, the fans want us to bring it back. We had a lot of fun doing it the day. Uh, but I think that we'll get together at some point and do it. I see Alex lives here in La. I see him every few months and it's just a matter of trying to find a venue and we want to do a live show if we're going to do it. Oh, in front of an audience. We see really crazy like 4,000 person live shows kind of nuts. Why would you want to stop that? Uh, you know we did for so many years in our show involves a lot of drinking and so we were just like, I killed my liver. It was just like, do you have to do drinking?

Speaker 1:          02:53:28       Why? Cause that's kind of the show. The show is two guys sitting on the couch getting hammered talking about dumb tech stories.
