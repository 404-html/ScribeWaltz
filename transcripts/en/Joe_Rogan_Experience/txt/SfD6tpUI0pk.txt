Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Now as a person who's governed state and you look at the, what happens when someone gets an office, when, when Obama gets an office, promises all of these things, gets an office, changes almost everything. Um, what are the hurdles? I mean, what are the differences between the hurdles of someone who governs a state versus someone who governs the United States? And how much more difficult is it to change things? It seems like the United States is like a gigantic ship that takes so much effort to shift even slightly that these presidents get out of office eight years later, exhausted looking like they've aged 50 years and very little gets done.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Well, I, I think there is a silver bullet to the system and I hope I'm tying into what you're saying, but I do think there's a silver bullet to the system and that would be term limits. Um, I think that for the most part of politicians, once they get in office, the main concern is to stay in off, right? And if you had term limits, I think that people would do the right thing as opposed to whatever it takes to get to meet Bruce and for the Senate Congress Senate anywhere, right? Well, Supreme Court's, uh, another topic, but, uh, but certainly elected office

Speaker 1:          01:21          agreed that we have it for the president. Why not have it for all elected offices?

Speaker 2:          01:25          I think I'm the best example of term limits. I really enjoyed the job. I had the opportunity to serve for two terms. Uh, so I, in my estimation, I press the limits term one, but not to the point where I wasn't going to get reelected. And then when I get reelected I started off by saying, you know, let's examine the drug war in this country. I started off by saying that marijuana should be legalized taking on what I thought at the time was, and it still remains so as one of those really fixable things in our lives, um, that would make the world a better place. Um, but because of term limits, um, I was emboldened because I, man, I was getting out of office and there was no return.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Right. Um, what are your thoughts on all the other recreational drugs, not just marijuana, but the more controversial ones like maybe cocaine or Psilocybin, lsd, things along those lines.

Speaker 2:          02:23          So when I was governor of New Mexico, I had a um, uh, I, I went to Portland, Oregon and judges in Portland, Oregon. There were judges that wanted to meet with me in Portland and so I went to meet with these judges and I didn't know what the, what it was going to be about, but it was six judges, Portland, Oregon State district judges. I'm sure I'm getting the wrong label, but what they said was, was, hey, governor Johnson, we just, we're here to tell you, we completely agree with everything it is that you're saying, but we would like to share with you some stories here that, um, maybe you can pass on to others that will allow others to better understand the drug issue. They said that they're really horrible drug out there as methamphetamine, that people that use methamphetamine really have their behavior altered and not in a good way.

Speaker 2:          03:12          So it's really the bogeyman drug out there. They said I'm methamphetamine. Is the best example that we can think of of a prohibition drug? It exists because it's cheap and it's easy to make, and what they said was was that, hey, we're not suggesting the following, but if cocaine were legal, these people would be using cocaine instead of methamphetamine without the negative behavioral consequence, and that's true, but if the government were to tell the truth when it comes to cocaine, cocaine puts holes in your heart. People that use cocaine their entire lives are stereotypically Whitney Houston that die before they're 50 because they die of a heart attack from using cocaine. Now, will there still be people that will use cocaine knowing that they might die of a heart attack? I think. I think there'd be less cocaine use if people actually knew the truth and could trust government.

Speaker 2:          04:10          When it comes to the truth, I just maintain that 90 percent of the drug problem is prohibition related, not use related, and that is not to discount the problems with use and abuse, but that should be the focus. When you have 8,000 deaths a year in this country, 8,000, which is staggeringly low due to cocaine and heroin overdose, and people will immediately say, well, yeah, the number is so low because it's illegal. No, you can argue that if it were legal, if quality quantity was known, it's arguable that those desks would significantly decrease. Although there will always be people that will commit suicide. Always be people that will push the limits. Yes,

Speaker 1:          04:57          you're, you're always gonna have people that abuse everything. Everything, everything, everything. I mean, we're, we're living in a culture that has alcohol available at every block all over the world. I mean, everywhere you go, there's a restaurant or a bar or somewhere that you can buy enough alcohol to drink yourself to death. It's readily available. Yet when you consider the amount of people that actually drink alcohol, the, the, uh, the low number of deaths is pretty incredible. And it's because we're aware of the effects of alcohol and it's pretty. When you get a bottle of Jack Daniels is pretty consistent.

Speaker 2:          05:28          Well, but there are 100,000 deaths a year that are contributed, uh, that, uh, get contributed to alcohol consumption and I'm not talking about drinking and driving or, or violence committed under the equal abuse, alcohol abuse, statistically, no one dies from marijuana. That

Speaker 1:          05:47          what I was going to get to was that when you look at what's happening in Colorado, one of the more interesting things is the lessening of violent crime and drunk driving. Those are two effects that have dropped pretty drastically, noticeably statistically because of the legalization of marijuana that you would reduce because of the legalization of a less harmful, more peaceful drug. You'd reduce the effects of what's right now, a readily available and incredibly prevalent drug.

Speaker 2:          06:16          I have always maintained that legalizing marijuana will make for a better planet on the medicinal side of marijuana. Um, marijuana products directly compete with legal prescription drugs, pain killers, antidepressants that statistically kill 100,000 people a year. No, no documented death due to marijuana. On the recreational side, I've always maintained that legalizing marijuana will lead to less overall substance abuse because people are going to find it as such a safer alternative than everything else that's out there. Starting with alcohol. The campaign to legalize marijuana in Colorado was a campaign based on marijuana is safer than alcohol. And Joe, as you were pointing out all the statistics that all the naysayers were going to go south, uh, have gone, have gone better. There are less traffic instance. There's less overall crime in the state of Colorado. Colorado is vibrant and does it have to do with marijuana? I think that that's an ingredient, uh, comprised in why Colorado is so vibrant right now

Speaker 1:          07:27          questionably unquestionable. And I think a prime example of how screwy the system gets when people lobby against the legalization of things that don't harm anyone is the fact that hemp is illegal federally and that we're trying to make it legal and trying to make it legal statewide and in various states and start production of hemp. But hemp is not psychoactive. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          07:51          We, we, we can sell hemp products in this country,

Speaker 1:          07:56          but they, they come from China. My bias or my company on it, we buy it from Canada. We buy hemp protein from Canada and it can't grow it in America. We can import it, but we can't grow it. CBD, CBD oil. Yes. Same thing. Not psychoactive helps pain. Very effective for people just not getting people hired. It's not ruining lives, not doing anything, but there's a lot of people that are concerned that are making money off of the alternatives. Especially with hemp. I mean that was the reason why marijuana was made illegal in the first place.

Speaker 2:          08:26          That's the reason it was about hemp, the conspiracy of dupont to promote nylon as opposed to, uh, and, and of course they, Randolph hearst with his paper factories, they made a, they made a marijuana illegal. But because the marijuana plant in the hemp plant look the same then hence hemp was also made illegal. Yeah, that was,

Speaker 1:          08:51          yeah, conspiracy. Yeah. Well that's, I mean that's all been proven. So it's, we're in a strange time that it's 2016. It's still illegal. Again, slowly starting to become legal and people starting to, I believe in Kentucky and a few other states, they're allowing farmers to profit off of this incredibly vibrant plant. It's easy to grow, doesn't require pesticides, has a variety of uses as a textile, as a commodity for food, full amino acid profile. It makes amazing clothes and made this jacket.

Speaker 2:          09:22          This is made out of hemp. I mean, if it's. If, if the marijuana plant were discovered today in the Amazon, it would be hailed as the greatest discovery of humankind in 1999. A good news, bad news here in 1999, I was the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana in 2016. Bad News. I'm still the highest elected official in the United States to call for the legalization of marijuana. Although Bernie Sanders apparently rolled out of bed and hit his head and now he's come to that same epiphany. Wonderful. I'm glad, but in 1990 minutes a roll out of bed and hit his head on that. He came to this epiphany at this point in his life. He's never said it before, uh, no, not until he's been running for a, for Senate. So you think it's like one of those lick your finger and put it up in the air and check where the breeze is going. I'm glad that he's joined the big crowd, but, but in 1999, 30 percent of Americans supported legalizing marijuana in 2016, 60 percent of Americans now are supporting the legalization of marijuana and not one politician outside of Bernie Sanders in office, um, is. And when I say elected official at the congressional, senatorial or gubernatorial level, not one politician in that group outside of Bernie Sanders, myself, have a spouse legalizing marijuana. I think what a disconnect. What an incredible disconnect between what people think and our elected officials.
