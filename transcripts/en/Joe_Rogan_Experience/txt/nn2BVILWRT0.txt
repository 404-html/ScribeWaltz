Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Oh, [inaudible] is bad for your, for your Wang, for your Dick. It's probably bad for a lot of things. You know what else is bad for it? For me at least personally, my experience when I got off of it, my endurance, like really? Yeah, like I've felt stronger. Like I felt like physically better. I go, we'll get tired like when I was on that. Yeah, I heard this terrible side effects. Ari Shaffir experienced severe depression from propecia and didn't put the two and two together until after he got off of it and a, he had like bad depression and it was all in. He realized like, Oh my God, it all started when I started taking propecia messes with your sex drive too. You did. [inaudible] guys. My Dick, like a bullet. I'll be honest with you guys to take it all the time and my Dick is always hard hard right now.

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       You're amazing as you always like to say. It's not testosterone. I'm just perfect. He tells me, I think might just ask her is too high. Like look at your inbox. You're built like this dude. I took my shirt off. Don't ever say you don't have any. When I took my shirt off, you went like this, you go, you held it in but you went like this. You immediately might think I shuttered and then you were like, oh, you need to get in better shape. I was a woman that would be excited. Yes. Did have a pose off. We had a post hoc just now two 48 year old losers posing off. Literally I'm on my phone, Joe, go shop. We were making, you were making you judge us, making you jazz. Are both my friends not be. Both of you look great about who looks younger. At some point in time you're going to grow up. Like I always assumed that this would, this would not be funny for me. It wouldn't be with my friends.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       Of course being retarded, we loved it never ends 80 and doing this. I think so. I think we'll always be attracted to round soft surfaces. Fighting's any kind of penetration and it will get our attention always. Like what happened? He got punched him in the face. Well listen to this crazy shit. Dana White told me that the guy who invented Regena King, Peter Welling is that his name is in, in Germany. Dusseldorf. Germany is the one that coby Bryant, all those guys are flying out to Germany to uh, this regena keen procedure that regenerate amazing antiinflammatory properties. He's figured out a way to regenerate collagen with an injection with an injection, your body starts regenerating it's own college and like a 20 year old Danny saying wrinkles will just go away. Your skin will just tighten up. You are going to look like a much younger person. And this is all within like the next year.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       Really? Yup. There on that count. He did look at my face. You're beautiful. So tight. They're on the brink of doing this. They're that close. Like they're setting up the infrastructure and they're getting rid of the role with this stuff and when they do that shit roll. Hell yeah. When they do, it's going to be fucking bonkers, man. That's pretty wild. You're going to see Barbara Walters looking hot. I know. Whatever. They're doing crazy stuff with tissue regeneration. I wonder when they're gonna be able to do that to backs, because people that have like really fun, like I ran into my friend alder was when Eddie Bravo's black belts last night and told me he hasn't been able to, I haven't seen him awhile, told me has it been able to do Jujitsu in two years? His back has been fucked up and it just doesn't get better.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       It's, yes. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Well, I'm doing a disc degeneration, you know, there are two girls I know who are in wheelchairs, you know, and, and uh, they are, are they going, is it from Your Dick? It's from a deck from the deck. And, uh, you dictum they're both actually super attractive. I have to be honest. And I, I'd be lying if I said I didn't have, so you're talking about spinal injuries and you know, obviously the, the, there's a long way to go before that, but there's a guy in San Diego at doctor who I guess works with electrical pulses, um, and he has had some success in sort of, he shoots and electrical sort of, uh, I don't know Paul [inaudible] in some cases. Uh, it's, it's given some feeling back on their legs and stuff. So it's, it's promising, but I think, I think we're way now they're going to fix all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       They just can't figure out how to regenerate spinal tissue. They can't figure out how to connect. Once your cord is severed, they can't do anything about it. But they're very, they're very hopeful. I don't know what they're doing it with penises. I mean that you're unable to transplant a penis. Not only did the guy that they transplanted his penis and he was excited, he got his girlfriend pregnant. Wow. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Craig was the hardest thing for so many veterans is when they get their legs blown off. The first thing they talked to was saying, the first thing young men got to say is, what's going on with my, My, my dad of course. And of course, and it's so devastating. It's such a devastating wound. And one of the things that they were trying to get money for it and they were like, look, we, we legs are more important.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       He said, you have no idea what you're talking about mentally for a young man when he gets an injury to his groin, that's fucking more devastating than almost anything else. Just to it down sizing. Also, when you, Dick gets blown off with your balls like you, you don't have testosterone even planning. Exactly. So it's obviously, there's a lot a lot to say about that. The horrors of war, the idea that you can just figure out how to fix bodies to the point where anything that's broken can just get repaired. You know, think about like 105 hundred years ago. If you got a broken leg like 500 years ago, you're a dead man. We're going to have to put you down. The thing is, you know the one thing, they can't figure out how to help your brain. It's the only company kept figuring out everything else.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       You're good. I feel like. Why don't they just drill a hole and shoot some stem cells on there? I don't know, man. It's this crispr crispr cas nine is fucking incredible. That's the new frontier, and in 10 years we're going to be, we're going to be literally taking your DNA and putting a gene in the area. Apparently just shooting a gene in the area of that. When they snip your DNA, there's this whole, you know, do you know how it works? It's kind of wild. This is a great radio lab podcast on Chris. I listened to it twice so I could figure out what they were saying. You know what? The con is tall. This though is the, all this advancement and medical and all that stuff and we're fixing everyone is, it's going, everything's gonna get over populated. Right Pete, when to stop dying.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       There will always be plain old death. I think the biggest question is how the average lives can be way long. It's already increasing. Also, how do you, how do you pay for like there are certain cancer treatments that are $1,000 a pill. I mean, you can cure hep c now and it's $1,000 a pill. It'll cost you $84,000 but you'll cure it. You will for sure. Take the cap. C is is a curable disease. It's not. It's no longer a manageable disease. Used to be really hard. You'd have to take interferon, which would only work on northern Europeans buyer's club. The look on Brennan shoves faces. He can still fuck Pamela Anderson with the bullet. Hold on with the Collagen.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       Sign me up son to it. You've got to get her to do squats. I know. No one has little. No. I said no, nothing. Oh, panhell. I worked with her. She hadn't asked easy. When did you work with her? I did stacked the great tv, so in the 60s it may as well been stack. She was, she was 14 she was 38 and it's still very hot. How old is see at the time, so you're talking about like at least 10 years ago? About 10 years ago I saw Sydney Crawford. I was coming out of yoga in Santa Monica. She is jaw dropping. Gorgeous. Beautiful. She had a long conversation with her and her husband like six months ago at a party. Yeah. She's, she's loud as fuck. Fucking, she's like 50 yes, 51 something like that. I love it. She keeps it up baby. She's in Christie Brinkley.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       Yes. 62 have you seen it? No, it's hot as fuck. Really? She seems to have this older lady. Oh No, she was the hottest dog. The lady I saw Raquel Welsh when she was in her sixties and a straight up dime piece, but some women are beautiful. They're whole fucking lake and hang in there, Barry, rick and hang in there. Fucking rare. How much effort it must take to keep that up. I mean it's a day. It's a job. You don't think it's genetics. It's probably that too, but also effort. I don't think there's any woman who looks at that fantastic that doesn't do something like either the fillers on their face or they work out like a fucking demon, which is a mandatory or they go to, they have to, they have to probably do cryogenics like that's Christie Brinkley. She's 62 that's nuts. My mom is very similar in age now.

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       I would go on a date with her too. She's hot and that's not even a good picture because like the sun's behind her or faces in the shade. Like she's legitimately high definition. Beautiful. That's crazy. She might fall off it though when you get in the sec. You know what I'm saying? Like bones of which probably just sleeps all the time. Just like the bathtub. It's filled with blood. I started noticing, I started noticing like for me like about about four years ago, maybe three years ago. Like, I noticed that girls just didn't look at me the same when I come off stage like I, I mean I talk about my wife who's a, but when when you as a young man like you're doing standup, you would always have some female attention. It's, it's died down quite a bit. Dry it up, write up a little bit older.

Speaker 1:          00:09:06       I'm old guy, I'm 48. Now if a girl who is 20 and she would just leave them there, I'm sure like we were talking about it, her friends would probably be like how old is for sure. Yeah. Your fans know are more interested in Bingo and shit. I'm not very so what does that college and Shit coming up soon? I'm shooting national by the gallon, but the couch catalog, shoot it right into your face holes. I'm going to take my shirt off here cause I got cheap phone's off too. Yeah. But um, they just don't like feeble old dudes, you know, weird like calling shoes and they don't look like fuck gravity's winning. Some guys, some guys let themselves go. I've never understood that. Yeah. Look, we were just talking about Christie Brinkley. She's like way older than us. Yeah, but we would all fucker. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:09:54       Give him a chance and the right circumstance. I'm taking my sports to a new level. By the time I'm 60 drugs playing tennis. What does this tennis thing, why are you so obsessed with that? It's always been somebody. You take them something manly. Look at Jujitsu I box bro. Oh yeah, you do bro. I go, I go, I go four rounds. Amazing. Don't why you're looking at his past and as Chris van Heerden. That's not the answer. That's on the answer to that question. It was about, I don't have to get out of all the details stuff going on. Do you have about three? It was about three weeks ago. Did you watch the UFC this weekend? I did. Did you, where would I and by the way, yes, not to brag, but I called every single fight, including the Rose Page fight and the uh, Frankie Edgar, Edgar, uh, well you didn't call the result.

Speaker 1:          00:10:36       You didn't know. He just picked those guys. Pick the winners, pick the winners. I don't think anybody, I thought Frankie had a real good shot at decisioning. Like when my friends ask me like who's going to win? This was going to win that. I said Frankie has a real good shot of decisioning chat. The chat also has a good shot at knocking Franklin percent. The only reason I picked so fucking hard, I mean he knocked out Ricardo Lamas mean he bangs and he also loads up. Yes. I just figured I, for me I pick frankie because I, I knew frankie wouldn't gas and I think if anything, I thought if Chad had to keep up with Frankie's pace, he would gas toward, we'll chat actually came into this fight light cause I think he anticipated that kind of pace that frankie was going to put on him.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       So I was talking about two different buckles and he said the chat was way later for this fight. He did a shit ton of cardio. Like he was embarrassed by the conor fight that he gassed out so quick. Right. Obviously took that fight on two weeks notice, which is a joke when you're a big guy like him and you've got to cut weight to get down to one 45, his entire campus is probably all about him losing weight, you know. But this, this camp you got in real good shape. I just got clip a lot of these fights or it's a tossup, like it's so close to the matches were so close so he could have went either way. So many people were so fucking mad at me. We're after the fight, they give suggestions like the UFC says, um, the truck will say, who do you think should get the next

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       shot in your hair? Yeah, they say the golden goliaths. Okay. And so, uh, they had, uh, this, the footage based up for Frankie Edgar. And so I said, um, I said, honestly, I don't think that a rematch is the right, well, you definitely could do a rematch. The problem with doing a rematch is with Aldo, conor mcgregor and Aldo. The problem with doing a rematch as it'd be so hard to sell when a guy gets knocked out that quick. When you hype it up for as long as you did, you'll hype it up for two separate events. It dies off and then the first punch connor connects with it, puts him out. He was a star, but it's hard. It's hard to sell that. But if you want to look at like, like lineage and you look, look as history, you'd say, yeah, Oh, the guy was a champion for 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:12:40       He should ever eat. He wants to, but does he sees it. He's the thing. There's a giant list of people. People say that Cain got an immediate rematch as a junior, junior dos Santos knocked him out, but he didn't. He thought big foot Silva. He knocked out big foot Silva and then he got a rematch. But traditionally, traditionally inboxing, correct me if you're not in box, but that's the wrong argument. You'll go off the UFC, so here's the counter. I can go, I'm with you as soon as don't be, we're like rematch. I'm like, well he just got murked in 13 seconds. There's not much of a rematch. But if you look at the history of the UFC, he should get a rematch just based off the way they usually do things. So we look at, we look at Barao, right, we'll get brow, he lost immediate rematch.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       We look at Anderson Silva, immediate rematch. You know there's, there's tons in the history. Ronda rousey immediately match all those. Yes. Such a bad ass. He should get immediate rematch according to what they've done before. Right. It make sense. Not think what they've done before is based. I think a lot of it is based on like what kind of compelling contenders do they have for that title and especially compelling contenders where you look at their, their style versus like the style of the guy who is now the current champion and if you wanted to pick like the most intriguing stylistic matchup. I think it's Frankie Edgar. Yes. Frankie Edgar. Because I've fought at 55 and one the title of 55 meet legends and Bj Penn just knocked out Chad Mendez with one punch before that. Beat the fuck out of cub. Swanson shut it out. I mean he beat Uriah Faber.

Speaker 2:          00:14:06       He's, he's fucking, he's smushed everybody. They put in front of them for a few years now. He's a monster. He deserved. But how can you give someone say like Rhonda, an immediate rematch and make holly weight? That's a very good question. As you're saying. I agree. I'm not saying that Rhonda should get an immediate rematch. It's true. You weren't, but for the most part she's getting immediate rematch, right? It's guaranteed. Well that's the plan, but she has to pass the medical to make sure she's healthy and all that. But the plan is she's going to get the rematch, but it's only financial. But financially, the Holly Holm fight with Ronda is the biggest fight for Holly Holm. Holly Holmes going to make like $7 million for the Ronda Rousey for her. If I was Holly Holm, she doesn't want to wait. She wants to stay active. And I totally understand that and I think, you know, it should be her prerogative as a champion to kind of choose, but financially, that's the smart fight for her.

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       Like it's good. She's going to make the most money. She does. She wants to fight me. Should tape before. Yes, she does. Her and her camera. Let's do Ameesha one's a fight. The UFC saying no. So how can you grow this law? I'm saying you can't play favorites because when the, when the, when the public smells favorites, then you're losing credibility. But does he have one tab for the marriage? Is that favorites or is that smart? Financially was really good. What about Verdomme cane? That's comedian Kane and verdomme. We're not going to have an immediate rematch. They offered for doom other fights and I don't know how they came to the conclusion of cane fighting, but I apparently there was a bunch of other people in the mix and they came to settle on cane. It might have been that it was her dooms choice because financial reasons like the f the cane fight will be much more financially viable.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       I get it, man. Hanan Barao you know what I'm saying to you? Give and morale. He's not a draw at all. Right Tj? Whoops. His asked you like left. This guy's been a champ for so long. We give him enough. I see what you're saying. That there should be consistency. There has to be, oh shit. Hold on. You don't know what you talking about it. You can't, you can't play. You know what I'm saying, Joe? Like you can't play favorites because you're standing in line for a second. The whole erupting him. So, but you, there just has to be some sort of consistent where you just can't play favorites. Well this is good here. This is good here. You know, I keep the same with the, and Damien Meyer brought the sub. It's a great point. Yeah, it's the same with the, the rankings because who the fuck where the fuck you?

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       Here's one that doesn't make any sense to me. How come you Riaa hall knocked out Gay Garden. Who? Saucy but gig massage. He was ahead of him in the rankings, knocked him out of his last visit. A bunch like that. There's a bunch like that. That's a thing, so that's the most egregious, in my opinion. There's been bigger ones that I've seen, but most of the fighters, we laugh at the rankings. We used to laugh in the ring. It's like one and two, whatever it takes. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what to after that. Who's voting on these? I don't know about. It's the same thing with a lot of these title shots like, okay, let me ask you won't be taken seriously. It can't be wwe style. Let me ask you this. Do you think there's an inherent problem with the promotion being the UFC also being the ones who dictate what, what?

Speaker 2:          00:17:12       Who fights for title 100% because normally it's not like, what do you mean by that? WBC like is a sanctioning body, right? For Boxing, the WBC decides who's the mandatory contender and then Bob Arum or don king or golden boy. Those are the ones who promote the fight. The UFC is both right there, the sanctioning body, and they're also the promoters of the fight. So they have a vested interest in going with the best financial option. This is why Tyson fury was just stripped of his heavyweight title, Tyson Fury, just legitimately outbox Vladimir Klitschko beat his ass just a hundred percent. It's kind of weird, clunky style. You have won every round, every fucking beat Vladimir Klitschko guys and lost in 10 fucking years. And they had an immediate, um, uh, defense of the title that they were imposing on him. And he passed on. He said, I'm not doing that. They stripped him of his title.

Speaker 2:          00:18:07       This is within weeks of him beating Vladimir Klitschko to the title. So this is a drast, drastic, drastic contrast to what the UFC has. The UFC would say, look, you, I don't care what the ratings are, you're fighting Vladimir Klitschko again, because that's where all the fucking money. Yes. Right. And that's what they would do. Well, think of the NFL and NBA did this, or mlb, if these other major leagues did this, you'd have the most popular teams. You'd have to say that he's in the playoff lot of time you'd have, it's not a valid comparison. It is because not because you're talking about, no, no, no. Because you're talking about teams. You're talking about teams versus individuals. It's not about Harrison, don't you think disagrees? I think you need to play for a championship. You have to go through a whole season. You go through a whole season.

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       You have to win to even be in contention to play for the super bowl to be in contention to play for the major league, but it's still not. It's very black and white when you're in, but let me go see. He's not black and white. I may ask you guys a question about about, that's why it's not a valid comparison because you can't sand junket taking serious. You're going to have to come up with a formula where people can see the madness behind your reasons. I cannot tell her rhythm or something. Right? Yes. That's what Demian Maia was saying. Damien Maia was saying that after the, the, I think he said like, I don't know how many victories in a row he's had, but at welterweight he's been virtually like flawless. I mean I think one person might have beaten them at welter weight. That's crazy. Who beat Damien Maia at welterweight.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       But look, Damien Maia made a very good point. Damien Maia. So he's such a fucking respectful gentlemen and such a, a perfect representative of martial arts. That guy is a gym. [inaudible] quote. He goes, I just do punching to set up my take down so I can do Jujitsu cause I don't want to hurt my opponent. I want to be able to train the next day because I just want to get in there and win by Jujitsu so I can go back, train. They can go back to train. Wow. He's one of the good ones that he's amazing. He's the fucking young guy. Destroy though, hey, let's quit tossing these young up and comers and he just raped. Oh, but who cares? I man each gun or just edit it and set it up and let him choke them all. Okay. So Roy McDonald beat him. That was the last guy at welter weight.

Speaker 2:          00:20:14       Oh. And right before that was jake shields beat him, which was a great fucking fire man. But that was a split decision. Roy beat them unanimous decision. Split decisions are so weird because sometimes they are clear. You just got an idiot judge and I don't remember how about Romero and jock array. That was a very close fight. I thought I was going to be a drawl or split decision have been, well I thought it could have been a draw because I think eol definitely got a 10, eight round the first round. But the question is will they scored a ten eight round when you got a guy completely on Queer Street, you spinning back fist him in the jaw, knock him and John Corey was, he got up to his, uh, after he took a fucking prolonged beating on the ground, he got, he got hit with some bombs by Yo el.

Speaker 2:          00:20:59       He gets up to go to his corner and he is on wobbly legs. Like they could have easily stopped the fight. And I was thinking that they might should have stopped that fight. But jock, right. Being the stud that is came back and reestablish himself in the second round. Partially because Yo el gassed cause eol who looks like a fucking superhero. The most ridiculous history. Not just for five, three you mean three minutes. Exactly. That's why that's why he fights. He fights luke rockhold and tries to go five rounds. This is my aunt Jo. You can't give you, I thought after that fight, whoever wins, you can't give those guys a title shot. There's, you do Weidman rockhold to you don't give the winner of that bullshit fight or a title shot. I don't think, uh, I think you could make a real good point to that.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       Um, but this sort of contradicts what you said about having a very clear algorithm as far as like who becomes a number one contender and who fight too. But this is the thing, I'm going based off past UFC history. You know what I think they should do. I really think this, I think there should be a way where people sign in on facebook. You know like you sign in using your facebook so we know you're a real person and the public votes. Then you also have the media vote. You have the mixed martial arts media, like the the guys who was like the Golden Globes almost. Yeah, something like that. And then you have fighters vote. So you have, so just like how you have three judges that score a fight, you have three sources that you use to pick who the contenders are. It's a good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:22:25       Who the number one contender, wisdom of crowds. I think it's a bad idea and I think it's going to lead to a lot of trouble if you just leave it up to the UFC brass to make. I don't, I don't, even though I work for the UFC and I've worked for the UFC forever, like people ask me questions. I don't know. I don't know. Like when I get, I don't know who the fuck does it. I don't know who makes the rankings. I don't know shit. When I get to work, this is what I do when I get to the UFC, I say hi to everybody, a hug, everybody. I get excited, I go, I can't believe this. I start going over the, the matchups. I um, I've already watched video on fucking everybody in the card pretty much by then. And when I say I don't do research, I'm kind of full of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       But it's not that I don't, I don't do it as research. I just do it because like, oh, it will be coming to him. How's he fucking how to handle this dude's got a nasty, we re Alvarez kind of fucking wicked good team. Like if they go, if he tries to take this kid to the ground, he's going to shoot for that double is going to get caught. Nikea teen, it's not your job as is a fucking nasty kickboxer he's gonna want to take this guy down, but it is my job sort of, but I would have, shouldn't know like the rankings and decide that. I'm just saying that I would, I would do everything that I do even if I wasn't working for the UFC just cause I'm like freaking out about these events and that's just what I get in the past. But because again, I don't know what the fuck is going on besides that. When I get there, when I show up, I say my highs, I get my shit. They put the mic on me, I high five

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       Goldberg, we hug each other. Here we go. You know what? Don't they know? I don't know what's going on. Share more about your opinion and you know, especially in the public. Well it's not, some people are mad though. This is what we got into the beginning that I said I don't think that it's smart to have all doe fight right away. My opinion is that first of all, although got knocked dead. Okay. When you get knocked dead like that and you need a long time off, you need at least six months off conor mcgregor fight next Tuesday. Yes. And I think that Frankie Edgar could also fight next to 100% I also think that death fight will be fucking bananas and for a Fan. I am so excited to watch that fight cause I think Frankie has a really dangerous style for a guy like conor who's taken it down repeatedly by Chad Mendez.

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       True. He's a fucking nasty wrestler. His cardio is off the chain. His footwork is fantastic. He's got Mark Henry in his corner. They're going to come up with a bad ass game plan between Kenrey Henry and cavenaugh and Frankie, who's a fucking winner. And Connor, who's a fucking winner. God Damn. Let me ask you, what would you be most excited about? You ready for this? Yes. Cowboy to beat dos Anjos dos Anjos Connor in Dublin in front 80,000 fans. Oh yeah, a hundred percent hundred percent you're right. Think about more writing. You're right. The title Donald Serone. Connor, let me just say one thing giant if, yeah. Hofeld dos Anjos is a fucking beast and I think those two are going to clash and who knows what's going to happen. Especially since still sun just beat cowboy. The first fight. I think it's going to be a wild wicked fight drug that I'm no longer right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       Oh, drug testing. Did you just say there's going to be that crf but wait, wait, take me back to a second. Let me say one thing about you've got to give Josie Aldo a rematch in my opinion for two reasons. One, I think that at the end of the day he was the champion for 10 years and if anybody's earned a shot too. I know I believe. I think conor mcgregor is has a secret which is he's, he's watching these guys strike and know something. They don't know he's, he somehow, I don't know if he sending to doesn't matter. Hold on Hon because that's just saying who you think is going to, what I'm saying is this, when you knock a champion who's been that dominant and that good for 10 years out in 14 seconds there is the question. There is a question which is was that in some ways a fluke, what did he make one mistake and paid for it, which can happen in mma with those small gloves, does he get another shot to at least kind call longer how it goes. He's going to come out extremely aggressive. I'm going to count and I know that and I hold it and you see the video of him warming up in the dressing room and then in contrast like a split screen with him warming up right next to the actual fight itself. He was preparing exactly for that maneuver and he's making, he's mimicking all those face first movement and he does this little slight step to his right hand side. He makes

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       an adjustment. He throws the first left hand, the first land hat and debt doesn't land. So if you watch him, him moving, he throws that sidekick to the leg. Then he makes a very slight step to the right although moves to the right hand counters them with the left boom. Hey know something. That's what I'm saying, cause I think that he would fight him again and knock them out of that's real. I think it's irrelevant. Champion gets a rematch. I think he deserves it. I really do. But here's the thing, it ties up the title for a long time and you have all these contenders. Yeah. You have an amazing group listed contenders. How about this? How about you have Joe's a Aldo fight, Max Holloway and you have a fucking great fight between one of the top contenders and Max Holloway. This young, exciting kid, 24 years old, Pete and everybody just figure it out.

Speaker 2:          00:27:29       Jeremy Stevens, he's elusive. He slick. He puts on a fucking show where a motherfucker, he has crazy cardio. He's driven and fired up and you can't quite have them fight for the title yet because Frankie's ahead of him and it's, you know, the division is super exciting. Frankie fucking clear. The way man fight. Frankie was pissed. He didn't get the shot when Chad got it. After he beat Uriah, he, they thought that Frankie, his safety first style gets Uriah was boring. You want a decision? He didn't try to finish him. Chad went out and blew ricardo lamas out of the water. Chad gets to shun Frankie's like, what the fuck? But I did the cub Swanson. Look what I did do all these other people. So then what does he do? He goes out there and takes it out on chat. Merck, Merck, something. Put some away in my opinion, like as a fan, I'm excited to see that.

Speaker 2:          00:28:15       I think here's another thing. I really believe this wholeheartedly and I think this is a very important point. Fighters should wait a long fucking time after they get knocked out like that. True. He got cleaned, he got flat, and then he got hammer fist. As he was out, he, he got up and he was asking what happened, what he was putting his hands up and going, I don't know what he's saying because he's speaking in Portuguese. Because he was shaking his head and they were nodding their head. They were saying yes and that would be goes, no, no, no. And they were going, yes, yes, yes. Here's the other thing Joe. A lot of people are talking about, I hate to be a stickler and I took some fucking shit for saying this. You're bat shit crazy if you don't think Josie Aldos body looked different.

Speaker 2:          00:28:55       You're batshit crazy. If you think he's going to fight the same also and all these people are giving me all the shit for it. His Camp I think is one in seven Oh and eight since this drug test and came out. So you're talking about a different fighter man, a completely different fighter. Well, so for me that's a huge x factor. There was a leaked audio from inside the truck of me saying that someone got the, when the, when the audio goes out, there's an audio feed when the main event happens and when that main event audio feed goes out, they, anybody could listen to it. That is it picking up the feed to it and broadcast. And I said that his body looked deflated, it looks smooth and that, um, I felt like he looked really nervous. I said he looked nervous as fuck and I said, I don't want to jump to conclusions.

Speaker 2:          00:29:38       He might just be doing a lot of cardio, which is possible because one of all those big problems, and Dana White, he said this is a perfect way of describing it, that all of those, the very best fighter ever for two rounds. And then he would always gas and then he would always sorta coast like Ricardo Lamas. He'd beat the shit out. Alarmists the first round, the end of the fifth round, Ricardo Lamas was on top grounding pounding dominic to mark comics. Same Goddamn thing. Well, he was on the antibiotics with harmonic, but yeah, for staff. I think so. That was, I never heard that he was, when he fought harmonic, he had just done, he'd had staff need done. Google that, Jane. That's true. Um, but, but, but, well, how about Luke rockhold won the fucking title unbelieved on, on antibiotics. Did any protocols when his first match and Ebi yesterday, um, he had, who's dying of staff days in the hospital.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       It's their mother and he was in the hospital for a week. Like denny was dying on stat from staff just to come to you surprised by the, by Luke's domination. Like that. Totally surprised. Totally surprised by a lot of thing and we totally should get to that. But um, I, I don't know if Aldo had concentrated more on cardio or if he had gotten off steroids, but I do know, and this is nonspecific, there's a huge problem in mma with steroids is a huge problem and that problem is being cut away like cancer by this new program by Jeff Novitsky. I also know that they tried to test all don't camp and all those people had the cops pulled on these people. They wanted to get him kicked out of the country. They were trying to de de de, de port them out of the country. Then when they finally did give him a urine sample, he tripped and spilled his pice.

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Is this not weird to anyone? That's insane. Doesn't take them a true way. Spilled piss in my entire career. I have. The thing is his cups all the time. It does get feathery. All there was covering from an undisclosed infection. It was on antibiotic hall. Callan, hey guys, come on guys. The thing is I should know that it doesn't take away anything that all was done in his career. Even if he is, I'm not saying he's never failed a test. So who knows. Right. We needed Lance Armstrong. There you go. All insane is all I'm saying is it seemed with Lance Armstrong steam was baseball. He was exonerated. He stolen the pitch on some shit. Yeah, everyone's on some shit. Alright, great. No matter whether he's honored or not, he's greatness. This I'll, Josie Aldo is one of the greatest pound for pound fighters ever. For sure. Ever, ever.

Speaker 2:          00:32:02       And to go on a 10 year run like that, you don't in the UFC has said like, hey, you know he'd played it safe and he goes to decisions. You shouldn't do that. But you know what else? He's great. But here's the thing, he fucking wins. Yes. And like him risking losing, like to unload on somebody like Uriah Faber did. Like uriah faber flat, Frankie signs and your riots sort of faded in that fight. But the reason why faded is cause he landed a bomb on frankie signs, rocked them. And then when after I'm blue as load, that fucking frankie signs guy, he's tough as shit cause that this is the 35 year old guy who's got like one other fight in the UFC. Maybe two. Okay. And then he's fighting Uriah motherfucking favor. Right. Okay. Was this crazy? It was ranked 13 yeah. Yeah. I mean it's your why of Faber is like one of the most experienced guys and one of the best guys ever did not win a UFC title.

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       Right? He's only lost title fight. Yeah. So he, he bombs on this guy and then nails him with a knee to the, I think it was a temple tart. Some parts, some bad. I mean the kids all over the place and your rise unloading on him and that somehow the guy survives and then your eyes like he's like, oh boy. You know, he's like, she's took a deep breath and kind of looked at the clock is like you know better than anybody that when you unload like that, that's never how anybody fights. So when you unload like that, you're going all in, you're pushing all your chips and this guy just pulls out four aces. You're like, boom, bitch, Connie, what happens? That's when you got to use carbon. No, perfect one sample palm strike. You guys never use plumbing skit from the huddle. How about your eye goes, our friendships done.

Speaker 2:          00:33:35       Tj dillashaw, your Ryan White. He was saying, he was saying it's going to be like rocky and the good guys. Gonna wait, wait. Why? What happened? Him and Tj, they had a falling out because tj went to muscle farm. The muscle farm offered him, but I don't follow the will. The reason, one of the reasons why Tj went to muscle farm is two reasons. One money, but to Duane Ludwig. Yeah. Duane Ludwig and Tj have a fantastic working relationship. Duane Ludwig is a fucking, he's got some crazy mental disorder that makes him concentrate on fighting every single second of every day. I think he's got a running thing. I think he could be hanging out with his wife, going to the movies, eating dinner, talking about baseball in the back of his head. He's watching counter, right hands, leg kicks, movement session. He looks the rain man of fighting.

Speaker 2:          00:34:22       He's obsessed, man. He's obsessed. And that's exactly what you want from a trainer. Tj recognizes that and his personality and Dwayne's personality jive. Whereas your bias personality and Dwayne's personality, we're water and oil. They fucking clashed hardcore and you're Ryan never wanted to have anything to do with that guy. He's like, fuck this guy. And dwayne and him didn't get along and Dwayne was like, fuck him. And they argued about stupid shit and you know, here's something that a lot of people don't know. There was a point in time where we were considering buying that Jim on it and I was going to be on it. Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna buy the ultimate training center. We were thinking about buying it and making that team like an audit team and we were talking to those guys about how to make this work, but it was right when they were starting to go at it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       When dwayne and Uriah, we're trying to go at it and we were like, first of all, it was the like, I was going to have to figure out like how, how would I do this and be impartial. It's very difficult to do. You know, you're like, I love cowboy serone I fucking love that guy. He's awesome. I'm I hanging out with them when I'm in Denver. He's the best, the best. It's just amazing personality. He's just, I just want to hug them when I see you want to be around the couch and he's just a true bad ass too. And I respect, I deeply respect Hoffeld dosantos I think he's a great fighter and he's a great guy. I went to our, he, he's very friendly and, uh, you know, I was, um, who, who was telling me that, uh, there were, um, oh the fuck was it?

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       God dammit, I'm drawing a blank. Someone was telling me that they, they were, um, hanging out with him somewhere and he was like helping them out and telling them where the best places top deal with me in Brazil. That's right. Thank Jesus Christ. Oh my God, I feel like the nicest guy ever. He's going to do, you'll see now with them every now and then. He's a great guy, but so I have to be completely impartial. You know, I have to, I have to figure out how to separate myself. But is it even, can you even ask, can I ask myself to do that? If I owned a gym and I had fighters who were fighting against guys who are a team that you own basically. And you know what I mean? I don't know man. Everybody always thinks that they're always gonna feel. People are always gonna feel like you're biased in some way or another.

Speaker 2:          00:36:26       If they find, if they, if you're rooting for, if they're rooting for someone and you're calling the fight against that person, that they're rooting for it, they're going to consider it. It some sort of, I've never seen, I've never heard you be biased. I'm todd [inaudible]. You are like, fuck that Russia shit. Damn dumb ass down. No one's ever been harder than you. It's the hardest, hardest fights ever to call. Cause like, you know, I can do it when you lost a travis, like I was broken up man. It was hard. Turns to me he's had at least he didn't get hurt. That's the important thing. It was hard. That was hard. Kallan was right behind me. He was sitting right behind me. That was a hard [inaudible] he came in here like close. Yeah. Well it was close. It was super close fight. But again, you know it's, it's a tricky but so this is all we were just talking about Duane and Uriah like they just didn't get along, which is totes.

Speaker 2:          00:37:23       It's so, it's such a fucking bummer because if their personalities did like, I almost felt like man, if there's a middleman here that comes in and sorts all this debt, like what did, I felt like what is the issue? Is this a financial thing? Personality things, two Alphas personalities, guys, guys who get territorial, guys who want your [inaudible] really strong personality and he's also like super organized and successful. Super successful and super focused. Like your Riaa is like, you know, he's a very admirable person. Like when you watch like how he conducts business and also look at the tight knit bond that he's created with his team. Yeah. You know, you only create that kind of a bond when you are that kind of a leader, you know, and that's what he is. And so for him, when Tj took off and went to this muscle farm camp, I'm sure that it was like a knife in his back.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       Fucking devastating. Well Tj and your I should fight no matter what happens with Tj Dominick Cruz, that fight has to happen. I really think so. I'm so excited about teachers' excitement of this. The back story. We love a good story. You know what I'm saying? It'd be so don't we do that dominick Cruz, tj fight might be one of the greatest fights. Dominic Dominic would have dominic wins and then Uriah and Tj fight for a number one contender status. But your eye in dominic have a history too. That's not a bad story either. It's not a bad story. Can you, can you think of another more compelling contender that would be ahead of your Riaa besides Tj? Like, say if Dominic Beats Tj or, well, whoever wins that fight, who would be next in line for the title instead of Uriah. Who else? 10 and brow isn't it? He'll make the argument, he could make the argument but he's have to win again.

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       He got destroyed and his last fight, Tj didn't destroyed teenagers, didn't just beat him. He lit him up like a Christmas tree, covered them with gasoline and lit them on fire and drug testing and through him threw him off a cliff. I mean it was, no, there was not a moment in that fight other than the first initial exchanges where he was like fired up and it's like bully beach, Tj and dominick Cruz have such similar styles. I almost feel like, like dwayne watched a lot of dominick Cruz fights and kind of, I mean as, am I wrong about that? Well there's a lot of guys that are employing that sort of neo footwork movement now, but I think dominick was the best at it, the earliest he's, he's so elusive. It's like, so like, like you get used to a guy like here's a different weight class but is a quintessential like Thai style.

Speaker 2:          00:39:55       The style striker, like thiago Silva stands right in front of you and he's got that fucking rhythm and he's, you know, he's not, not mobile. And then you got the complete polar opposite, which is like connor. Connor is like, like when you see conor fighting Aldo, he slide Nin he slide now. Like he's very difficult to judge, in my opinion, the best ever at that is dominic dominic's all over the place. Like he's fucking move in a sliding. He's over here, he's over there and you're trying to figure out when you can uncork a punch, like a good luck time. And that guy, have you ever had a conversation with dominic? Very, very smart guy. Have the highest MMA Iq I've ever seen. Wow. I agree with you. I agree with you. I'm saying it was my favorite out of those guys that breaks down fights and analyzes what went wrong, why it went wrong and he's a real student.

Speaker 2:          00:40:41       Uh, one time, uh, dominic and chill. Sonya and myself went to unbreakable gym and we were trading with jails before Charles fight and Jon Jones and we training jail and dominic was breaking things down. I was like, Holy Fuck, God gets an oracle can also, he's had all this time, he's had all his time while he's been injured to think and work on things and he's not, it's not like you stopped paying attention to mma I keys, he's been focusing on it. Whereas, you know, if he hadn't been injured, he'd be in camps. Getting ready for fights, like almost might've benefited his MMA Iq to have that time off and to be obsessed with returning about what he's gonna have his hands full kcls. And you've had that surgery. Can you get, when you get acl surgery nowadays, is it, is your knee as strong? Because I'm strong, it's stronger, stronger, stronger, quite a bit stronger.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       My, my right knee has a cadaver graft. It had a cadaver graft. And what the cadaver graft does is they take an Achilles tendon, which is way thicker than a regular acl, and then they put it in place and then your body re proliferates. That acts as a scaffolding and you're not stem cells. Your body grows like they restat, they connect it and your body starts putting blood through it and then growing new tissue. Wow. So your, your acl becomes your own. Like I had a, I had a cadaver graft, but those cells are not cadaver cells that are in my, near south. Those are myself, but it's way thicker than it would have been. But Donald 150% stronger than [inaudible]. So, so that, that's the case maybe with Dominic's knees, he tore the same one twice and then toward the other one he taught tour one twice toward the other one and he tore his groin and he broke both his hands.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       He's, he's, he's a fragile God. Like when I had him on, I'm one of those UFC interview shows. He was joking around. I mean, show me scars in his hands. He's got, I got a bitch hands. It's just, it is what it was like. This Guy Greg Cook, this Guy Greg Cook who has full bar, like the NFL now has what's called a full body screening or some functional body screening. The UFC has got that now too with their new camp because they were finding they would bring him in and he would find that that is all amazing athletes. And then one guy kept tearing, he'd run and he kept tearing his groin. He kept telling the tenant had attached his like to his pelvis to his quad and it couldn't figure it out. And he's the guy who comes in and goes, I know what the problem is.

Speaker 2:          00:43:04       You're off balance. One side of your body is stronger than the other and that's a huge issue. It's really common. Yeah. So now the training centers around, you know, basically finding out where you're weak and you know, you very common around that with pictures cause you know you throw in with one arm. Yeah. And kickers like nfl kickers, they have real problems with that. Like back problems because you're always kicking that one leg in the same way. For Dominic though. It's years of wrestling and he's a champion for ever. He's only had one loss. He's up. It adds up. You can chalk it up to inbounds. Nomad is Uriah. Uriah caught him with a good team so me. Well you're right, it gets your neck. You know, he fucking giant people often get done the cruise beat, Demetrius Johnson, he beat Dj dam but they also forget that was one day they didn't live anywhere near Matt Hume.

Speaker 2:          00:43:57       He was coming into town once a week. This is a fact. He wasn't training like the, the Ian Mccall fight was the big turnaround for Dj. And I had him on the podcast. He talked about it cause he, you know, Ian fucking rattled his cage and it hurt him. He had vertigo after that fight. It was pretty fucked up and I'm mad human pulled him aside and said, look, you've got to stop fucking around. Like we're going to do this. Or you should maybe get an education. Like you should figure out what the fuck you going to do with your life, but this ain't it. Like you've got to figure it out. And so he went all in, moved near the the gym and now he's here five days a week and look at him now. He's, I'm just saying dumb dum ba dum

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       different one though. And different weight classes. Just shots. Some different guy now do dimitris at tiny guy. He's much smaller than not. When it calms tiny too. He is thin, but he's taller and longer and bigger and like one 35 is a cut for him. Demetrius Johnson is to put a rock in his pocket to make one 35 wow. They got different fighters. Completely different. Totally different fighters. They're much better now, but just seeing them on both of them are better now. I'm fucking so excited for that fight. I'm going to be there. It's in January. Boston. Yep. Tj motherfucker. Are You doing the Florida court tomorrow or next week, right? Yeah. Yeah. This weekend, Friday, Saturday, whatever it is. Yeah. That's a good barn. That's a good card. Really good cuts. Our lawsky versus a, I mean not our Lasky Junior dos Santos vs. Alistair overeem was on that car to, Ooh Johnson. Michael Johnson versus Nate Diaz. Juries. On the flight. Go to my church. I was miles jury down to one 45 now. Yeah. Hafez dos Anjos and the size of those not just head. Look at that head. Yeah, my Lord. Jury. Yeah. There's Jerry Olivia the fucking fight.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       CB doorway. Oh my God. I don't even know. That was the only card. Hey, nate said it. What do you want to tell him? Stop. I love them. It's been rough watching him. The last few fights. Do you think CBA, CBA just chases after him, puts it to him. He kind of got it right. Yeah. That's what they do. They'll tell you, beat nate, get on his back foot and throw bombs. He just seems like he's absorbed so much punishment after the law over the last few years. Bomber man. It is Obama and he's been on it. He was on the street until he got dealt with. Yeah, I mean cb the Oto beat him. I heard him at that body kick bad and uh, who else beat him? The Doberman Nodo really fucked him up. That was, that's what ended his streak. That left kick, ma'am, that left kick of Leah's cards and super interesting man.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       Dos Santos over him. I don't know what to tell you again. Testing's going to be a mother fucker. I said what you think a hundred percent yeah. Fight should have happened three years ago when it was all fucking the wild, wild west. I don't think. I thought they didn't. They fight the fuck. Is this the person they're fighting? No. Brian, this is the first time they're not. He know so much about mark harmonic versus Josie. Hey, I'm making a call. I'll tell you something else. I'll tell you something else I'd like to see. You're going to, the guys are gonna Laugh at me. I like to see something I'd like to see. Don't say boyfriend. I'm going to say don't say something stupid. I'd like to see my boyfriend and he is my boyfriend, Luke rockhold and my best friend, cause I've had dinner with them and hung out with him.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       Uh, I'd like to see him fight Jon Jones. I said it, but he, he's just won the middleweight tiny. I know what he won, Bro. You, can you ask him to leave? Hey John. John is fantasy shit that you have in your head? Yeah, it is fantasy shits a stand on my head cause it's turning. It's, you know when you see a Weidman versus rockhold and then Weidman wanted to fight Jon Jones for the light heavyweight title. Yeah. Weidman's movement wasn't the same. I weidman looked off to loss a lot of weight. He was a in the one nineties in Hawaii biblically on me like that. I don't think so. It was a strategy where he said, I'm going to, I'm going to, maybe he's on steroids. Look, but that's just not the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:47:48       I think what I'm saying, I come in there, I'm going to be light. I'm going to hit them with pace, uh, cardio pace. I'm going to wear him down. He did. I think he did do that. I think that was, I mean he was throwing a lot of like, not full power kicks to the body, but a lot of, a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure with his grappling. He just fucked up throwing that we'll kick stay in your lane. Oh my God. Fuck you dude. I was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of mma championship fights. 100% talking about it like, it's not like a mistake. Like, you know, you go through like throw a or leg kick and you get countered with the right hand and get hurt. That's normal stuff. This is a crazy acrobatic move that he's telling beach bar.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       Yeah, he probably was right because that's what knocked out rockhold maybe thought he's a sucker for wheel kicks. The grind is working for you when he's taking him down and starting to work. Starting to weird lookout. Especially like we knew luke was on antibiotics. Fuck yeah, keep doing that. But he didn't think he knew. He knew that Luke's pace was slowing down. Right. You could tell. I think what happened was he realized that he was a lot stronger than Chris Weidman. He's, he looked just stronger, bigger, and I think he went, and you know what? I wrestled with Cain Velasquez and, and uh, Daniel Cormier, I'm stronger and bigger than this guy. And that's what happened. I think he just started. No, there's something that happened at all. He caught him, he made a mistake and he took him down the keys through a wheel kick and literally gave his fucking body up.

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       You get taken down and when rockhold gets you on the ground, his fucking top games. Nasty, super nasty. And you saw it against Leo Machida. Like I would like to see rockhold in just straight up Brazilian jujitsu competition. I bet he is at a very high level mother fucker. I just think that that's why I'd like to see a rematch. You say that kick doesn't happen. We've got a hell of a firefighter. That's a hell of a fight anyway. Cause that back kick that happened in the third round. I mean this is a fourth round stop it and I had at one to one. Yeah, I did wonder one. It was a really good fight. It's not like, you know, Weidman came out guns blazing face first and rockhold connected with straight left with like conor and Aldo. This is like a war. And then at the end of the war, you know, I mean rockhold got that advantage.

Speaker 1:          00:49:54       Never let it go. Adding Weidman in the face more. I feel like he was, I feel as though he was kind of standing on the edge of that pocket and he was, he has hands down and I, I felt like rockhold seems so confident. Maybe it was gas, but he looked, he was just confident enough to just, he knew where the shots were coming in and they would counter, he was hitting him in the face. More Weidman was pressuring him and his kingdom, his body, it put more pressure on him. Really paying off to the body is thrown a lot of body. So we're Luke's though. In the beginning of the fight, they were hard. You're going to have to, he who you didn't like laying to any flushing and cottey kicks hard. God exert her cane side. What does that look like? It must be just one of the hardest kickers in the division for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       Rock holds long. And you know what's interesting when I talked to Javier Mendez, I said, did he have a traditional martial arts background? He goes, nope. He came to me when he was 17 and I'm like, that's crazy. Yeah. Because when you watch like the flexibility and dexterity, like the looseness of his legs, like when he throws that question mark kick off the front leg, he's so fucking Lou serone style. Yeah. It's like, like ceremonies had more time for fucking years and you look at Rocco's genetics, his dad was a professional basketball player. His brother's a professional surfer. Have this monster just looming. Wayne, do you find something? He found his calling him and me at 17 what we get, I think what we're starting to see is we're getting guys who are martial artists, but they're really good athletes and that's who's taking over Holly Holm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Jon Jones, freak athlete. John Jones [inaudible] think you're totally right. Rockhold freak athlete. I think you're totally right. I think, um, but it's just so shocking to me out of all those that I see. Well, holly obviously has a long extensive kickboxing background under winkeljohn has a fantastic trainer, but the thing that freaks me out the most about rockhold is the, the, the flexibility and dexterity of his legs that takes so long to develop that kind of whip. You know, like his kicks aren't just hard. Like Weidman has strong kicks, there's strong like he throws him, but there's a stiffness to him that rockwell doesn't have. Rock holds got like a taekwondo thing going on. Big, big fucks up. He's a fucking business. He was just 16 and and San Jose when we were hanging out, I said, how much do you weigh? He was like, sure was 16 of course I did.

Speaker 1:          00:52:04       I took them down and in your face I took him in and I took him in. But don't kid yourself. Had My hand on his back couple times. Talk this track. Brian came back from hanging out with Lewis, had got his haircut just like him. I went, the fuck you doing? He goes, sounds around luke. So I wanted to get my hair cut like you're 48 copy. And I look him in the eye and I went exactly like loop when we go to a bar. And I looked at my one that is and we caught eyes and I looked at him, I went, I tell Ya. And he goes, he smiling. He went six three and I go, of course you are. And I looked at his hair and I go, I don't want to take you to go deeper with your voice. We had a moment, guys.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       We had a moment here that I went right to super cuts for $12 and I go, oh my God. And I looked through the camera picture of Luke rockhold that you fucking piss my and fingers. My friend Tarik who trains luke goes, hey, counts here. I think you'd would suck luke stick. We asked them did you can take I think out of that sentence. All right, I'll do it just as a goof. Don't tell anybody. What a shocking moment. What is shocking turn of event that one wheel kick changes the entire fight. She see Chris crying. Yeah. It was also the, the pressure that rockhold put on him, I think surprised Weidman, like when rockhold mounted him and for sure not gonna eat those on. I would never eat those when brock hold mounted him

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       and, and he couldn't get them off of him. I think he was fucking shocked, especially when, you know, lyman has really good Jitsu and when he felt rock holds pressure, it's first time he's ever been taken down. First Time it's backspin on the mat and he's like, no, he's strong. He's stronger than, he had a technique to stronger t his technique was superior. It was amazing to see. Yeah, it was amazing to see. He's a fucking beast and I think there's, you can't underestimate the benefit of training with Daniel Cormay and Cain Velasquez, the heavyweight, the former heavyweight champion and the light heavyweight champion. They're going to ask her if there's a chance they could have the heavyweight champ light heavyweight champ, and now middleweight champ. All training together all came up together. How crazy is that? It is a possibility, but the light heavyweight, you got to put a little asterisk next to it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:11       I'm just saying right now, son. I'm just saying right now you gotta pull astro, big astrid analytic. Especially now. Now that John's trite, I thought left and 600 pounds, Graham and I watch him. I watch him throw my phone away, run out the door. I don't want to be around. It's crazy. John's a monster right now. He's, he's also a monster that's overcoming a really bad moment in his life and he's on the straight and now, now he's on the path. That's care while he should be. And those are good things to happen to you. You know, sometimes, you know I've said this before, but I'll say it again. I love a comeback story. I fucking, I like a guy who, who does the right thing and gets it all together and I love that. But I also like a guy who fucks his life up and brings it all together and love those stories though.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       Like I, I don't think John should be someone who is not, you know what I'm saying? Like do all this stuff is great, but be the heel man, be the fucking joker, the UFC and fucks to destroy. He wants to be Jon Jones. I don't think John Thinks of himself as a bad guy and I don't think he is a bad guy. I think he's a young guy who's trying to have fun and he's made some mistakes. That's what I think. I don't think he's a bad person to person. I don't think he's a bad person. I think he's a far cry from Holly Holm. Yeah, you're right. It's a holiday for me. Home is the perfect represent. I talked to her after the fight. Nice person of all time after the, oh she might be easily, I talked to her after the fight this weekend and you know we were talking, hanging out her and her husband, which I just said congratulations.

Speaker 2:          00:55:38       How's it feel? She's like, it does. It still feels weird. It doesn't feel real. I'm doing so many. She goes, but I don't even want to think about it. She goes, I just want to get back to training cause I don't want to get a big head and you know, and she's, she knows the traps and we were talking about the fight and she was, you know what I'm saying? She said, look, the reality is what happened tonight to Josie, all that could have happened to me. It can happen to anybody and she goes, you get caught with a punch and you get knocked out. It's happened. She's been in the sport too long I think to get a big head. I think she realizes the traps and she's been fighting for world champions before so she doesn't want to fall in that same kind of Rut that Rhonda did.

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       Also, if you're going to give this fight to, let's say they do do it in July, July, whatever the UFC 200 you give holly six months to know exactly what Rhonda brings to the table and train for it. Come up with a better game plan that she had before and make sure that her conditioning is on point, makes your body's healthy, rehabilitate any possible injuries she might've had assessed to make sure she doesn't overtrain but you got to remember Rhonda shooting movies. Well, Holly Kia bud plant, but when has anybody ever overtrained at Jackson Winklejohn there's super smart about that kind of shit. Jackson is really fucking smart about strategy. He's really smart about preparation. They've got some hardcore training ethics in that gym. Oh yeah, and of course you got Winkeljohn who's Winkeljohn was a fantastic kickboxer. He's a really good coach and Jackson is a really good strategist and they've got excellent training partners and you've got all this motivation about their lineup.

Speaker 2:          00:57:05       You got Greg Jackson, right? He's like the fucking Yoda of MMA. He's been doing it forever. He's a genius game planner. Then he got winkle John, who's a phenomenal coach obviously, and then he got izzy, who does the wrestling, does Jon Jones, Israel Martinez. He's a motherfucker, Chicago man, outstanding wrestling instructor and he's good friends with my buddy Justin Milo's, who's my trainer. Yeah. With all that experience game planning for, for somebody just to, you know, it's becoming a, what I love about mma now is it, it really is about your team, like just the brains behind you as well. Just that strata has to be, it has to be. There are no lone wolves. And you know, and I had a conversation with John before he moved to Albuquerque. We had this conversation with may or may not have been smuggled marijuana. And uh, we were in my hotel room in Montreal and if he was, you know, before he won the title, like way before, and I said, look dude, I go, you're an incredibly talented guy, but you got to get all the right people.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       The only way to do it right, you can't do it on your own because there's going to be a guy like you who's also incredibly talented and that guys can have the best team African. That guy's going to get the best training partners and that guy's going to have the best strategist and that guy's going to beat you. And you might just beat you by an edge, but that edge you could have overcome if you had all that same coaching. And I think a guy like John also, he grew up with two super athlete brothers, one older, one younger freaks. And I think he recognizes that he's, he might be special compared to the average person to his brother, not even in his own house. His brother Arthur was doing mma. I on the side, like while he was playing for the NFL and beaten John's ass job.

Speaker 2:          00:58:40       John [inaudible], he's a heavyweight champ in high school. His brother. Yeah, just pressing the fuck out of John. And then the youngest brothers, one of the best players in the NFL draft pick. So I think I want an, John had a unique point of view as to what freak athleticism really is and about hard work and talent, you know? And it's just, I think he just was getting by in the UFC without having to go 100% as far as his training and his preparation. Hundreds going to be horrific. If he really does get it really good, he'll be the best of all time. Didn't he say that? Worst thing that happened to him was not training for Gustafson and beating him anyway. And he said that that's probably, he said it was trouble. He was just like, God I can do this and still get away with you said it added and it was like fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       I'll just keep doing it. Just speed. This guy who trained the best campy that are had in his life and I did nothing. Still beat him. Such a freak. I'll tell you what, how many, how many fighters going to incorporate a movement coach now after connor doing all that shit out of them before I've been obsessed with the Europa Pitaro for I long time. Well I'm, I'm obsessed with him and I'm also assessed with that guy that I'm Carlos condit uses. He does that move nat stuff. I was watching a video on him training today, see if he could find, I think I appreciate I retweeted it. Um, but he does all this crazy shit. Like he's like doing chin ups with trees, like hanging off of trees and he's doing balance beam stuff and they're throwing sticks at him and he's catching them while he's bouncing on stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       He's Ah, he's at common for stuff. He's even doing training specifically for bow hunting. He's got like reps that he does for bow hunting while he's squatting and standing up while holding a bow posture, like to try to like solidify his balance in precarious positions on hillsides. Do that. Erin make, here's like some of the weird stuff that Carlos is doing. I mean Carlos is a really fucking smart guy. Really articulate. So when he talked like let's play this so we could hear it brings in the beginning, bring it to the beginning. He's also been doing the same training for about 20 years. So this must be nice. Bring it to the beginning first please. There you go.

Speaker 3:          01:00:43       Somebody is watching a fight. There's the punches, the kicks, the takedowns, the grappling. But what people are less aware of is, you know, for a fighter to be in correct position to execute a strike effectively, they need to have mastery of their movement, of their position, of their balance. I think that's really what separates the elite fighters from somebody who's, you know, good enough. Irwin and I have been training for about seven to eight months. People listening, students walking outdoors, balancing on a log. I think one of the most challenging things about training in nature is the unpredictability.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       It's talking about hae suffered an acl, meniscus tear while signing move. Nat definitely accelerated my recovery in that I was not only doing these movements and these different stretches in physical therapy, but also in my training sessions. When Irwin and myself started training, he looked at some of my previous fights and he saw some things that my head coach Greg Jackson saw independently. They saw the same exact thing, but what was great with working with Irwin and working in the movement that program is he specifically had exercises and drills to make those changes. Whereas, you know, some of my other coaches saw that it needed to be made but weren't sure how to get there. This was extremely challenging for me. We're trying to relearn something that we may have lost that as adults having sat in chairs or having laid on a bench to do, you know, very linear stuff like bench press or squat or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       We've kind of lost that natural movement ability and to gain it. It takes a lot of focus. I come home after I trained with Irwin and I'm exhausted, but as we go on and I have made these adjustments in my body has adapted. It's less and less mentally taxing and you know, more fun today. You know, today we had a blast for my last fight, meaner when working specifically on positioning of my body, lower level stability in a, in a lower stance position of my feet, which helped me move forward and backward quicker, which I think ultimately really helped me with the victor, I was able to move in and out of range effectively and land strikes and ultimately get the win. Wow. I think that it's, it's not just for elite athletes, it's for, for anybody. It's, you know, it's, you know, anybody who wants to get in shape. Anybody who wants to try something different. Maybe you were in the lifting or you're into yoga or you know, any different thing. I hear all the time. I'm plateauing, I'm strong, but I can't move. I'm flexible, but I have no power. Ultimately, we're trying to be the most functional able bodied athlete, person, human that we can,

Speaker 1:          01:03:38       boom. Interesting Shit, man. Yeah, it is. I'm gonna keep, I'm gonna stick with Yoga. I love that guys ponytail though. I'm going, I'm going out as a ponytail to his. He does. What's the fuck can we say? Don't ever say his name. Ida again. Like I said, it is. He don't eat no pork spelled I d. D. O the ease. You're calling me though. Does he have a ponytail? She certainly does. He's a beautiful man. I'm going to call him. Hey, don't take, don't put that his name in your mouth. Said Itto be respectful. You don't had idle idle when you put my second boyfriend name in your mom's boyfriend. I got two boyfriends and by the way, cross counters, the third boyfriend. It's very hard for me to choose. You line all those guys up in a jail cell. I have no idea who I got to choose, but I would do her laundry.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       I don't think you get to choose. That's part of the program. I don't do. I think that guy's cool. I think that stuff is cool. I don't, you know, for certain guys that you don't know unless you're doing it. I won't train with vegans portal. Wow. Well here. Oh, his hair's pretty lucky. Me Sir. Pull them up please. And show what he does. Check this out. Why does he do, is there any videos, great video know same shit. No. How did, how did um, fullscreen, how did um, uh, connor get connected to him? I wonder, uh, he said that he was very interested in connor. He does some crazy stuff, man. Well, you know what? This is really similar to [inaudible] as far as I'm looking at a movement, not your, all the stuff that Hixon Gracie, he was really into. But watch what he does. He, this is interesting really, when you go back to, cause like we thought of it as yoga and it is yoga, but wow.

Speaker 1:          01:05:10       Jesus Christ, body it up. This dude is doing handstand pushups on the edge of a table. Oh, he's not, he's not dropping his head below the table. Oh my God. Look at these flips and shit. He's watched it. It's what the fuck? Oh my God. This guy's a super athlete. Yes. He is like what is his, uh, on another video that's called white people breakdancing. Oh, this. Oh, the same video. It keeps going. So what is his background? Is he like age? He's from Israel. Look, he was a shit. He was a couple era guy. Oh my God. This is insane boxes. He does gymnastics. He talks about how important rings are. You got to relax Brendan. I won't relax. I flip that. He's doing that flickers. Incredible. Doing a one handed, uh, well, she's essentially doing like Cirque de Solei type shit dancing right there. Moving. What he'll do, what he'll do is he'll make you, he'll give you something to like, he'll make you catch a stick and he gives you a toy and as soon as you get good at it, he changed it up on you.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       So he always has you guessing. He always has you kind of deal. He had connor on the balance beam's in Santa Monica the week before the fight, doing all sorts of crazy shit on the beach. But look at this guy's fucking ability to move his body. That's pretty shocked. Buddied up. I'll tell you right now, cause it movement patterns. He's right now, connor wins with or without doing these moments. Hey to tell him, know about that man. I wonder if he's listen, depending on who he's fighting. I think these benefits, these movements and learning how to move your body like that, we'll definitely benefit him. And benefits are all the, keeps you from winning or losing. This is incredible. This guy, this is nuts, man. This kind of physical strength. It's ridiculous. It's a balance. That's some stupid course. Or maybe I'm just a hate. I am not into this.

Speaker 1:          01:06:50       I'm us to hold on a second. What do you mean you're not into it? I'm just not into it. Like what does that mean? I'm not saying impressive. That's cool man. I've seen people in Yoga do it all the time. Listen, you never like him. He never seen the guy built like him. It does that shit with that kind of body mass. Yeah. I've never seen that in a million years. I've never seen a guy be able to hold those positions like that. That's impressive. Yeah. I mean that's like a very small percentage of the human population is capable of moving their body. Like I don't get it. Like look at this. Look what he's doing. I know. I'm sure. That's great. That looks very hard. But why do you say you don't get it? I'm saying I don't get the obsession with it. Like how fast you guys are into it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       One handed one hand Shannon ups, dude, you don't think that's incredible. Yaps insane. So what? Why? Why are you hating? He gets it gets your body. That's what it is. Body. That's good for your shoulder joint. Yeah, I agree. Jesus Christ get Super Mad when I have a new boyfriend and that's the truth. That's gymnasts isn't just a new boyfriend thing. It's him looking at this guy's body and I'm, and I just don't think it's that impressive. Well all your, I go to yoga and I've seen gymnastics. It's not anything new. You're out of your mind and your mind if you don't think that guys impressive. I was going to say and looking at meditating, that's not impressive. I can do that. The only thing he's done so far that I could do, hey, what's up everybody? The

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       only thing that he's done so far though, see this stuff is all the higgs and Gracie type shed. Hickson was really into this stuff, super into it now. Natural natural stuff, um, was essentially like this flowing yoga style that Hickson was really into that a lot of other Jujitsu guys get into it. It's so interesting to see it all come full circle now with guys like connor incorporating that. But this is even another level. But you're, you've seen those videos of Hixon doing those um, full splits, standing full splits on a balance beam 20 years ago. Yeah. Holding his foot up in the air. Yeah. What do you try? Why Saint? You're hating that hixson now. No, no, I'm sure you'll have to qualify. Amazing. I'm saying Hickson was doing and he was, well this isn't, you can't let, it ain't chanting this route and was doing camps.

Speaker 2:          01:09:04       Bas rutten was doing crazy. Shavar did that. Can't be in chance, but he was in on chains and like, fuck with his hair done. You know what is, what are you running from? What are you running from my now? Nothing. I don't think you can give it that guy that much credit. Can I ask you a question? Can I ask you an honest question? Not doing that. We're saying the guy's impressive physically and that it helped connor to train with that guy. Obviously conor is not stupid. He's figured out how to become the world champion with one punch. I mean, he's not a stupid guy. He's, he's a marketing genius. Common, 50 fives even more trouble. Wait, he's not cutting. I don't know about that because a big part of what gets him there is he cuts. Wait, perfect. I mean he's, oh, he looks like he looks shit dog shit at 45, but whatever he does to rehydrate the next day, he looks amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:49       And he's done it with no ivy this time. Yeah. But think if he doesn't have cut all that weight so he doesn't deplete his body, but it's faster than all of these city bigger guys, it's going to take them down like Chad did. Then you've got a moisture problem. Much bigger problem chat as a tiny guy in comparison to a lot of 55 or it's like dos Anjos dos Anjos gets on top of you. That is a totally different world of physics. And wait, I agree. But you look at matchups like co Donald serone phenomenal match up. Oh yeah. Anthony Pettis. Oh, your best match shows are great. Match up certain match ups that 55. You're right, you're right. 100%. But, um, I think if you think of dos Anjos wins, they'll fight. Nope. No. It's only if calloway wins really cowboy winds as the money.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       That's the money. That's the medical, Ooh, that is a mega fan. Why do you guys say that w did not, if just Sandhya this way. No, I'm, I'm asking if he's so, cause I think like Joe mentioned that uh, Dos Anjos can put in that Chad Mendez game plan. We'll also dos Anjos hits fucking hard and he's got nasty Jujitsu. He's got a fucking pressuring game. But you know, connor might laugh at it. Connor might say, you know, like I got the solution to that look, Jeremy Stevens, doc, that dude dead. Yeah. I mean it's, it's very possible that connor might just see holes in his game that we're not seeing and he might be able to just don't think a big payday like dos Anjos Mcgregor's not a superstar fight. Right. It's really not. But it is a superstar fight. Whenever connor fights anybody and if he's got a big challenge in front of him fighting for the lightweight title, it'll be a gigantic, nope.

Speaker 2:          01:11:24       College big, no matter what color cow bully, that's the bucket. If cowboy can win next Saturday against dos Anjos would become the champion, the world that is the, and I guarantee you they'll probably call connor out, right? Unless they, unless it was a crazy war. Like you want a rematch? Yeah, they don't like each other, but unless it's a crazy war and you know, everybody says like you gotta do it again. And they both said we've got to do it again. The UFC says they have to do again. But again, like this is like when people upset at me about the Frankie Edgar thing, like I don't get to call, this is not my choice. I'm not, my opinion is just an opinion. I just see a guy get knocked dead. I see. Okay, that guy can't fight for at least six months at least and really shouldn't be fighting probably for a year.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       And it wasn't much of a fight I ride with right away. I was like, yeah, Joe's right. There's no way. There's a rematch. But then I thought about, I'm like, well, they gave all these other champs incident remains, but they didn't decane cain got knocked dead two against junior dos Santos. He had a fight. Big Foot. Keep people get saying, I can't get an instant rematch. No, he didn't. It did. Not More rematches then not. But he fought big foot Silva and by the way, the Anderson Silva rematch to fucking soon. And I said it and he got, he got lucky that he broke his leg. How about that? Not Obviously, not really, but he was getting beaten the fuck up. He got hurt real bad and the clinch Weidman caught him with a punch in the clinch. His legs went rubber. He went to the ground, he held on as much as he could and Weidman beat the fuck out of him for that first round.

Speaker 2:          01:12:46       And then Anderson threw that kick and broke his leg. And it was almost fortunate that he went out like that because why? Mum's going to beat his ass. Anderson was not able to take a punch anymore the same way he used to. Anderson used to eat punches. Watch the fight. You want to watch a crazy fucking fight. Watch his fight with Jorge Rivera where he lets rivera punch him in the face. Really lets him just punch with this. Good in front of Rivera. Let them pull it up. I'm gonna. Hey Rivera. Jorge Rivera versus Anderson Silva in cage wars in the UK. This is before Anderson came to the dude. I was a gigantic Anderson Silva Fan long before everyone that title I will you watch my calling the fight against Chris Weidman. I was a kid in a fucking candy store because he wasn't a, he wasn't a new guy to me.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Like you're saying when he fought Chris Leben who I say Weidman, I meant [inaudible] sorry. When he fought Chris Leben, when he came to central seating, it was crazy. I was a kid in a candy store cause I was like fuck this. This guy is a different kind of stryker. Yeah, this is a whole different animal you're dealing with like in Lehman's gonna come forward. Face first. The tailor made this. So Jorge Rivera who was on the left, who is a fucking hard punch, good hand and Anderson standing right in front of them and there's a one point in the fight. How long does this fight go, Jamie? 10 minutes. There's one point, the fight before Anderson knocks him out where Anderson stands right in front of them and literally lets him punch him in the face and Markdale [inaudible] who was with Jorge was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And he's like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          01:14:18       You should hear mark talk about it. Mark. It's a hilarious mark talks about it, but I love that guy. He's so funny. By the way, mark was also agreeing with me that all though look different physically. He like, he looks smooth, he looks the entire world except for South America. Agreed with you joe. Well, there's some people on the underground that disagree. We call Zack cody. It's just when you see a guy, it's hard to tell from a a still photo as well. A lot of what you see is in movement. You see like in the like they don't look as as explosive. Even the still photo, it shows a little bit, but not much. It could, like I said, it could have been attributable to cardio. I mean is let's say, let's say, well, there's no evidence at all. They'll ever did steroids, right.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       So let's say he never did steroids, let's say he just did way more cardio for that fight and didn't do nearly as much strength training and that's what it is. There's a difference in the way it looks. [inaudible] Silva was the biggest, that was the big contrast and the door of course [inaudible] it's public, but the tour, we knew to look for it. We knew it was happening. We knew about the testing, we knew about everything with Eric Silver. You're like hall. Yeah, he was. He was so bonded out with that apple bottom and everything too. When he walks in and he's taught here, when he walked into the octagon, it was literally like a scooby doo sound all across the globe. Canny panty drawer. No, no, no. That's what I mean. In the last fight crisis in the last fight, last buys, melted cheese, it just didn't make any sense.

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       But again it could have been that he changed his approach. He decided his gas and out in these fights like against Matt Brown, he gassed out and he has all this muscle and all this power and he's always going for it and he is a young guys. I ain't even 30 years old. It is possible that he just changed his entire approach. No more strength and conditioning, only just training, only cardio from a sparring and from you know, repetition. I mean it's totally possible. It's totally possible elster over him. When he got busted, it was in this protein shake to look how beautiful Anderson's movement. It was like, oh, he checked that kick. I mean it's all like automatic when he was in. By the way, he didn't come to the UFC until, I think he was like 35 man, look at him. He was going to retire with four is going to retire.

Speaker 2:          01:16:31       No, talked them out of it. How old was he when he came to the UFC? His third tour? I thought it was 32 you might be right though. I know he's going to retire and he might be right. Eggnog talked them out of it. It was like you have to fight. While he had had some, you know, crazy tough fights. He also had a falling out with shoot the box. Surprise. He's not retiring now. Why, why do you think he still went to Moitai Dream Team and it be like he, they created a team and he didn't have good training partners and there was a lot of shit going on, but he pulled it together right when he came to the UFC. Traditi ever. And will he pull it together in cage wars? Really? And then he came to the UFC after that. I remember he was about to fight Roy Jones and then everyone's like, Nah, that would have been so ridiculous. Been awesome. He got

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       lit up. It would have been awesome. Oh good. Wake up call to a lot of MMA fighters. They think they can box with the garlic Jones. Speaking of John, she says, get knocked down in the fourth round. Hey, stop doing that. You're a head lead commentate on HBO. It's not do that. Yeah. And I think that's going to fuck with his commentary for sure. Hundred percent not going to be able to talk that good after that knockout. I mean, it'll be a while before he recovered that he's had like five of those. I mean, unless he's getting paid crazy amounts of money, I don't get why he does it. No one really watched it blinked. The reason we watched cause he got highlight, knockout, you know, meanwhile Jorge Rivera did a lot better than rich Franklin. It's interesting. He sure did. I figured out how to, well, Jorge's it Moitai guys, I figured out how to fight Anderson from the clinch Anderson like at this point in the fight is sorta just chipping away at them.

Speaker 1:          01:17:57       But uh, how much more time is in this fight? How much, where are we at? There's a, the moment before the fights dot. That nice knee to the body. See, this is Anderson, like really in his prime. So you see Anderson, John Jones shadowbox into yeah, it's pretty cool. Interesting, right? Addison against that of rockhold called Luke rockhold beat him out. Oh God. It's horrible. Now it's over. Now. The champ, the new crown champions, the old Anderson Silva. No, Anderson's, it's, oh, look at him. Let me, let me, yeah, you're crunk for the Ken Shamrock Holy Space. You fight to Anderson took them down. Unless you are on testosterone replacement, when you hit your late thirties like that, there's just no way you can't compete. I compete in it. Look, if you got Anderson on the Vito Belfort Diet, I think Anderson goes back in there like a demon and, and who knows who he can beat until his, you know, 40th fucking birthday or whatever it would be when the wheels fall off.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       But Anderson, now you're talking about a guy who was brutally owed by Chris Weidman and then in the second fight had a seriously hard time staying conscious from a punch in the clinch. You know, I just don't, I don't think the body, I think the body can only take so much man. And I think he took it all. Victoria Anderson makes sense. Here's where it gets, here's towards the end of the fight. This is the second round where I'm pretty sure he stopped him the second round. But, um, there's a point where it's just fucking, let me start. Show me how much time is left here. Yeah, scoot ahead a little bit and see if we could find it because it's fucking preposterous. Andersen to standing of fraud of them. Here it is right here. Watch this and listen. Just stands in front of them and let's Jorge tee off on his face. Look at this. Boom, boom, look standard, right? Boom, boom, boom. Blog. Just just ate. It just stood in front of him. And eight. Now contrast that, that series of punches that Jorge Rivera who hits fucking hard to Chris Weidman's one punch in the clinch. Oh, night and day. That dropped him. I understand. Just can't absorb shots like he used to. He used to have a phenomenal chin. You shut down, your brain says, oh, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       here comes to chocolate dental. Same thing. Had a phenomenal chin. I mean there was times and Chuck's life where you just weren't going to hurt him. Sorry. Sorry. I think Dan's Dan Henderson pretty much until he got killed by Vito. Same thing. Yeah, you can eat everything. Who Do you guys have winning the Anderson Silva RFC [inaudible] that's not going to happen. Veto won't fight them. I talked to Renzo for teeth. Why won't he fight him? Veto it. Doesn't want to fight him. He wants a shot at the title and they're like, dude, you, you fought for the title and got smoked in the first round. You can't beat Dan Henderson and get a new title shot. Luke wants to fight him because he wants to fight. Vetoer he should. They said he goes, I want LFV tour and the silver platter. Yeah, he's going to cause that what? He said, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:20:51       That's going to be ugly for Vito. I feel set it up. Well look, you got to do Weidman. Weidman to Weidman rematch would be very interesting. Um, uh, rockhold Yoel Romero fight would be very interesting. I think were a marrow is not doing anything in the fourth and fifth round. All Jesus. And remember I was the guy, Jesus, he's saying forget. He said Fuck Gay. Do you know that trout just drove me crazy when the, whoever interviewed him didn't clarify that. They like, oh cool. They didn't know either. Well, fucking knew. I was listening to what he's saying. Forget he's Cuban. Don't forget Jesus. When I speak to them, you notice when I speak to him, I looked at him right in the eye. I speak very clearly and I tried to clarify everything he says. Like when he fought, uh, Tim Kennedy, and there was that moment where you didn't get off the stool. I had a long conversation with them. I was talking to him nice and slowly. I'm looking at, I'm trying to find out what he's saying. I'm trying to get to it. I've known a lot of Cuban people. I know what they sound like. They have that way of saying teas. It's why the t is a why there's not for gay. Jesus had been the PR team. If I was interviewing, kind of fucked up my saying. So you're saying don't forget Jesus CCC. Don't forget Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:22:13       No, he, it sounds like he's saying no for Gay Jesus. No, he's tall. He feels like he's like five, eight, five, nine. Oh no, he's, he's probably, uh, there's how gay Jesus, no. Yoel Romero had the flu for the last four days. Come on, Milky. Don't ever got to show that guy to get him up here. That guy wanted to come on the podcast with John Jones and he's like, I'll say some crazy shit. John won't say. I'm like, what? Who's America? Why would we want youth? It was Matt, John John's manager. Great guy though, by the way. Just fucking around. But he's the idea of like what your son, but he's like, you're going to talk for John. That's exactly what I don't want. Yeah. I want to know what's going on in his mind, but go fuck cheese out. Poor guy.

Speaker 2:          01:23:04       He got tortured online. Like people were mad at him like even like reputable, like sports broadcasters were tweeting at how are horrendous. What he said was and terrible. What he said was, I was fucking yelling at my computer. He said, forget. He says the same gags that do the ranking and they can't even get your oil shit straight. No, no, I don't do tr under the rankings kings. How's, there might be an undercut or no, let's do the rankings. I'm pretty sure, right? Some some head journalists. What do you do that who does it make more sense? Yes. Ryan seacrest who does the ranking? Oh, where does that, like what? What are the people, who are the people? The reikis aren't that horrible. I just think that when you know someone like Uriah Hall knocks out Gig Arbonne Saucy and he's below him on the rankings, that's fucking stupid.

Speaker 2:          01:23:54       Well you know the UFC brass was like we can't do the rankings because it's some bullshit. Cause whenever they're going to do, they're going to do pay dictate. That's based off your ranking. And then that was hard. Then they're like, oh fuck, we can't do that because bill, he's a huge fan of whoever he's lost seven in a row and they want to ranking number 10 do you have any idea, do you guys have any idea how much a veteran makes off a UFC? I off the robot. Let's not even talking about it cause I'll start throwing up on my keyboard to, yeah, that's the answer. You know what? Can I do a positive spin though? I hit on Reebok so much. Can I do a positive one? I dug the mcgregor trunks, the green and gold trunks and all those black and gold for the first time ever.

Speaker 2:          01:24:35       First time ever. I was like, those look good. Well they were there, you know, they're responding to criticism and doing a good job of responding to criticism. I disagree. I think the whole, the real reality of this whole situation is that it could have been all been handled better. I think everybody would agree to that. And I think the fighters are very disappointed at their lack of ability to be autonomous as far as like how much money they can make from sponsors. And like you're the perfect example. You know, I, and I've used you as an example and you know, people said that you weren't telling the truth and you know, now we know that that's not not correct. You brought me my fund, your financials, and I brought them to the fucking top. Yes. And we had a nice conversation about it and I think that it's, it's a, it's an unfortunate reality that we're going to have to live with now.

Speaker 2:          01:25:18       And I would, I would like to see out of this is, I mean the argument against it was like people are having condom depo on their trunks on that shit. I'm like, well how about don't have condom depot? How about you have you, you, you make a very specific like, listen, you can get all the sponsors you want, but you can't have anything that's going to be bad for the image of the UFC. This is what we think are bad. I don't know why Khan, which is what they did by the way. I don't know why condoms will be bad. Is it bad to not get aids? Exactly what it was. It was bandaid depot. Would that be okay? But aspirin depot was that okay. You have to submit your sponsors to check them off so you weren't allowed to alcohol, tobacco, anything competed with the UFC.

Speaker 2:          01:25:57       Did anybody, did it really diminish the entertainment value for anybody when someone was walking with dynamic fastener on their shirt, did he give a fuck at all? I will never give a fuck if Chris Weidman was walking to the octagon and he had muscle farm or fucking fill in the blank, you know, fucking where all those logos now they're on the mat. That's what bonds. Some of them are. Most of the map looks like a nascar. The fighters are in black and white. Unless you're a champ looking like assholes get not getting paid. That's the only issue I have with it. Well there's, there's definitely something to be said about that because none of that money is going towards the fighters and the cause. The only thing that's changed besides the fighters look in plain as fucking black and white is the matte looks like a fucking toys are us now.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       Yeah. I think there's a real, uh, option, a real possibility for fighters to get super involved in social media and put out a lot of videos and get people excel. If you put out a lot of content, people respond and they loved like this. A lot of people that I follow. Yeah, there's a lot of people that I follow. You know Ross training, you know at Ross training guy in instagram? No, he is like some pretty uh, intense, uh, personal trainer dude. He's got all these great workout things that he does on instagram. I follow that guy all the time. If he was a fighter and he had all these people following him all the time, or a lot of other guys that do these things where girls who do these things too, there's a lot of people that will girls, they do it. They won't look at their asses.

Speaker 2:          01:27:16       Man, I followed Jeff. I know you do get his head. [inaudible] the way I talk when I'm talking about either mortality or voice just got too, but I think that what it gives an opportunity for fighters to adjust and the adjustment is to concentrate or have someone that works where you concentrate on social media, put out a lot of content. I know miles jury does a lot of shit bomber though. It is about, we shouldn't have to do it. It would be better if they didn't. There's so many fighters. That's why if I'm conor mcgregor rate for this, if I'm coming or greg or I say I'm not doing shit to give me 20 million of fight, that's how much power I think that kid has right now. He has the most power I've ever seen a UFC fighter. Yeah, he's a nation behind him. He could sell out 80,000 okay, well I'm going to show you what kind of power he has behind him because I'm going to send these to Jamie and we're gonna Watch what it was like at the mgm cause.

Speaker 2:          01:28:02       I have videos of Irish people going fucking bonkers at a level that you've never seen in your entire life. We're talking about climbing on top of fucking casino tables, screaming, taking their shirts off. There's thousands of them. When he was there, when he won, he won. He's a bigger star than lesnar now. They stormed the fucking casino and when they stormed the casino, nobody could do anything about it. Nobody can do anything about the security guards are all standing around. I'm going to show you some. We've never seen a star like this, and for the first time connor's bigger than the UFC. He can go, I want this amount of money, or I'm not doing shit. And he just backed up everything he said. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna say Jamie right now. You never seen nothing like this. You never seen nothing like this.

Speaker 2:          01:28:47       Irish love him some fighting. Jamie, you got your phone on his Tiger Tattoo bums me out a little bit. I'm not going to Lydia. WHATSAPP. Jame airdrops not showing up. Airdrop is really wonky, man. You need to get one on your computer airdrop. Don't you have a phone? Turn it on. It's like, oh yeah. Should I email it to you?

All right. Don't just sell them. They use yesware. I wouldn't be at that casino. Yeah. Crowds make me nervous. Should I get rid of there right away? I get out of that. I don't. Yeah, you had to get out of there right away. And I'm like, mom, this is so ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:29:33       Nervous. Am I send you a couple of other ones, Jamie? It's just so stupid. It was so crazy. It was. I'm ever seen anything like that. You know what to pay out of my huge total, total new level of chaos and, and, and really it was amazing, man. I tweeted, right, right when he knocked him out, I said, well ladies and gentlemen, this is your biggest star in UFC history. How about arguably one of the biggest stars in the history of all combat sports? Because there's never been anybody that has won a fight that has had casinos overrun where the literally the security guy watch these videos. You're going to freak out. The security guys can't do shit. Dudes are jumping up on tables. They're taking their shirts off their singing all together. I mean, not just one or two thousands and thousands of these army guys.

Speaker 2:          01:30:22       Did it come to you? It does now. He's a special dude, man. Yeah. The thing why I'm just drawn to connor is cause he's a good person like you see as soon as it'd be, although yeah. Hugged him. Done the mic. Cause like he's a great champion and I'll respect picture of them hugging in the back. Yeah, man, I saw it. Yeah. It's very cool man. He's an amazing, like he's just a good person all change again.

You know what? As far as that goes to it doesn't have to do whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:36:25       He wants to come bitches out making money. Tell him the UFC. What the fuck to do? What is he going to do when he retires? I mean the amount of y'all some juice, it's going to be awesome juice and adrenaline and excitement that's going through his veins right now. Just the fucking electricity right now. Like a promoter. There'll be a promoter. How do you have shut the fuck up. How do you ever, how do you ever match that? It's all downhill from here. Down here.

Some guy got on top of the line in the fucking Mgo security, uh, off the line, sir. That's where we draw the line.

Speaker 2:          01:37:14       They don't give a fuck. You seem in the streets beforehand. Did you hear about the Irish guys were on their way to vegas and they have to, they kicked off the flight for fighting. Yeah. Didn't even make it a lot. Yeah. They didn't even make it to the fight. Conor mcgregor fan did. My buddy went to a soccer game in Ireland. They, they didn't get to the stadium. There were so many fights. It was nuts. It's just what they do. Yeah, they're fucking animals. It could be like a big ass movie stars. Oh yeah. He says he's gotten offers. He's not hold him for that. You know what he's doing is smart and what Rondo did was not smart in that regard, that she got distracted and spread herself thin. Took all of that short money, you know, it's a lot of money, but took it all. Whereas Khan or like no danks

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       I don't think any more than, I don't think it made a difference. I think Holly Holm is a different fighter. I think she met a different file. It's certainly made a difference. Brian, when you distract yourself, you are distracted. That I understand. I understand. This is what this is Brian standing up for distractions. Holly Holm is a hot, much higher level striker and would have been regardless. I don't, I don't think, I just don't think, uh, you can come meet with somebody like that. Who's that far advanced as a striker? Well, certainly not striking and she's stronger than Rhonda. That's what it looked like to me. He's drunk as fuck. Yeah. Well you know, she's definitely leaner, you know, and it looks more muscular and bigger and she's fought as high as 152 pounds. And Rhonda, correct me if I'm wrong, it's not a big double leg, single lecture.

Speaker 1:          01:38:39       She, she's a junior person who just got to get her hips close to you. So when she has people who in her camp, like this guy is, he or whoever it is who can neutralize that judo, push your hips away, drop level when she gets close, no drop in levels. Men, here's the big thing, they just avoided that left arm. Rhonda always ties up with that left arm. Yeah, I mean she does the same approach and almost all of our fights and it works on this amateur and it's not, that's a good way of putting it. It's not to say that like she doesn't have other approaches, but that is the approach that she's most comfortable with and she goes to more often. And when it wasn't working, you know, you fuck you that you had, you had that camp game planning and they've seen a lot and I feel like they've gained plan for very, very good fighters who are men who have a lot more complex.

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       And Rhonda for those guys was probably much easier to game plan. And then they had holly Holm who has been striking. I'm not talking to you, man, man, man. You know what I mean? Old men like the guy's eyes. I fuck guys like me. Hey, hey, hey, you don't know that. Well, I just heard he came out of the closet. I, that's what I heard from eve. I don't Rhonda doing movies and these distractions. That's, that's on her team. That's not wrong. Yes. People go, you should do this. No, you're fine. You're so much better than we know that she's got some shit advice coming her way. But what is from a lot of people? Yes. What is her camp like? You've, you've been close to her while she's training. Like what is her camp like? Uh, you know, I'm not gonna go into crazy detail.

Speaker 1:          01:40:07       All I know she works harder than anyone. So if she gets with the right people, she's going to be a lot better. If she gets with the right team that says, maybe don't do this movie right now, maybe let's save this move after you beat holly. Maybe let's do this then. It's not a problem now too, because if she's prepping for the rematches and she, we're about to go do that roadhouse and isn't a problem. That roadhouse movie, like movies are hard to sell when you're a bad ass. When the world knows and that your last fight, you got flat lined. I would suggest it wouldn't be surprising to me the way Hollywood Hollywood works there, where they go. A lot of this movie is built on you being the baddest girl on the planet and undefeated. Don't be surprised if sometimes those kinds of movies fall through or they downgrade or maybe they just don't happen. I wonder what kind of contract is involved. She's got like big

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       time movie agents, like a wonder if that was like built in protection against that shit. I would assume there is. If I'm Dana White, I go look at me, you're not doing amy fucking movies, your contracts with us. We're not giving permission to do any of this. So anyone who says yes, you can make a movie and still beat Holly, I fire right now. Anyone who goes, you can do this and still do and still be world champion is full of Shit. It's just not true. What do you think about her fighting holly in July? Uh, I don't, I don't know man. What the fuck she going to do if you shoot, if she'd make, if she's filming roadhouse while Holly's focused, like you just talked, call you the other day, right? Well she wanted to train. She wants to go right back to the gym after the fight.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       Yes. She might have gone to a fucking hotel room and hit pads and Rhonda can eat solid foods and then she's going to make a movie and then jump into camp in the same camp that has been telling her to do all this stuff, you know, and the same, you know, it's tough man. God, God blessed her. Hopefully shit works out but it's a mother fucker man. It is a motherfucker, right? If you wanted to get ready for a fight like that, you would want to go through a battery of physical tests like as far as your brain goes, cat scans, Mris like that was a fucking wall up she took. And when you know, well I've had people on like Doctor Rhonda, Patrick and Dr. Mark Gordon who talk about the damage to the pituitary gland and what happens when you get chaos like that and how important rest is in recovery and how long it takes to recover from something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:42:28       And then we saw the, the Anderson fight that we're just talking about how Anderson, he's take this tremendous punch. Then he fought Weidman and you know, it wasn't the same guy anymore. Like to jump right back in like this, look at, look at Mendez to Mendez, gets knocked out by connor, gets right back in there. We've never seen him get dropped. So he's not just drop flatline with one file. Yeah, yeah. I mean he came back and, and frank, he's not, you know, Frankie's a motherfucker man. He throws combos and he's very active and he stays, you know, he's more of a barrage of punches and Combo Poncho. But Frank is not a knockout artist by any means. And there's also the factor of kind of getting, I wonder, I would imagine any fighter who gets in the ring and realizes that they are just, that's a riddle that's very hard to solve right now.

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       I would imagine for Ronda, as great as she is and this athletic or she has, you know, there's no doubt that Holly Holm looked like she was just far advanced in how to dispatch somebody with kicks and she was disguising her cakes, punching and stuff like that. I would imagine there's an emotional factor which is, can I even do this? Can I solve this riddle riddle in six months? That's a, that's not a lot of time to catch up to somebody who's that good. Also to let all the dust settle. As far as like the devastation to your motions, your confidence or you know Ron does his very special kind of pit bull. Is She chomping at the bit to get back in there? I mean is she like, she's just straight up spreading. She's a special person and don't think there's a middle ground either.

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       I think she's going to come back and just be a fucking demon or we're going to see a shell and she's going to get fucking kicked in the face again and we never see her again. I don't want to see it. I don't think there's a middle ground. Even if she comes back in fucking phenomenal shape and gets fired up and motivated and does everything the right way and no distractions. Holly might still mark. I agree. Still don't have the skills to stand there with, with, and move in. And she goes, she can't take holly down. She's hot. And not only that, what of Holly's game plans even different this time. What if she moyie ties? They'll fuck out of those legs. Cause let me tell you something about Holly Holm. That girl's got legs like a thoroughbred. See Her bouncing around the Austin and do those flip flips. Well, who's got Brian Keller Hawks Game Plan for you? Greg Jackson right now, or the ladder over in Glendale. You know what I'm saying? You got sick, you got six, you got six months, son. Wow. Six months of the mad scientist Greg Jackson going, this is what we did this time. This is where we're gonna do this time. And Mike Winkeljohn and Izzy and Izzy. Yikes. Oh, and that she has confidence. Oh and John Jones in her camp and they trained together. I'd fake an injury.

Speaker 2:          01:44:59       That's what I do. Yeah. I mean she wants to fight her. I mean she thinks she's going to get me, she's going to get images. It's going to get eat. She's going to get eaten up by Holly Holm. Well, do you know all due respect and Misha is not going to fight that way. She's not going to charge after a different animal. It's a different fight. It's, I don't know who would fight me. She is me. She's got a different style of takedowns. She'll shoot for doubles if she gets to clinch, she'll very, her approach. She's got ricky lundell working with her who was also an excellent coach and coach. She's got some good things going for it. And then you know what you're dealing with also is when you see a fight or get into the octagon, you don't know what kind of injuries they've had.

Speaker 2:          01:45:39       You don't know what they're dealing with in training camp that they're trying to overcome. Like when Luke rockhold said after the fight they had staph infection. Like I talked to Bob Cook about it. Bob Cook right when I go congratulate, she goes, he almost fucking pulled out of the fight. I go, what? He goes, yeah, he's just had really bad staff. He's been on antibiotics for two weeks ago. You fucking kidding me because you never know. When holly fought Raquel Pennington, she did not look very good. And that was one of the reasons why I didn't think that was a good fight to have right now. She had a split decision victory over Raquel Pennington. I mean, Raquel almost beat her. She came within a hair of beating her. Let me ask you this, Joe, with, you know, with these, I want to say more well rounded athletes. Whenever we see a fighter who charges like it's almost no skill just to rush forward, they get fucked up by the better fighter. See, Aldo fucked up, Rhonda fucked up. We see these people, they also fight. So emotionally come straight forward and then you see the more talented find it like what the fuck pink. Yeah, you can't do that. Can't do it. And it was way more successful than Aldo at it and she, she's fighting less for competitions. So it worked well. Holly's a fucking Hoe for women. Holly is very high level, high level it, well not only didn't work, but she ate a lot of shots before one, it took her ass.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       That's what I'm saying, the superior athletes who it's like, you're going to rush forward and do what? I'm want to fuck you up. Right. Rhonda does have a fucking phenomenal Chin if you, I don't, hopefully still, but you look at the shots that she took that fucking elbow at one elbow that clean as she's coming after she blasts or in the job with our mom. We ever seen her get hit by a really good strike. Yes. Yeah. And you know, it was one of the things that we were discussing before the fight of like what you got to watch out for holly. Um, when we're doing the pre preflight breakdown, I was like, she's so good at shielding our kicks with punches. You don't see him coming. She's hitting you at the end of these punches. And then the kicks already coming. You know, when you watch our RFA fight, it was an RFA.

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       She fought and we'd watch all her other, um, MMA fights and smaller organizations, those kicks come out of nowhere, man. You know, and she, she knows when to land them. You know, she doesn't show them until she's ready to land them and they'll buy blanks. You see a parade in Albuquerque, 20,000 now. Really? 20,000 people came out to see her in Albuquerque. She told me, she told me she's happy to be in vegas cause at least it's relaxed. Gosh, she can't go anywhere in Albuquerque. She said she tried to take uh, she tries to go to a restaurant and have a meal. There's a line of people at her table that want to take photos with sauce and put food in her mouth. That's exhausting. That, that's, that's managing champion ship. Managing for tension for those people are fucking rude. Don't know. Mess with someone when they're eating. That is what it was later.

Speaker 5:          01:48:18       Well for tall, I can't believe I'm seeing you, Holly Holm. I don't care about your state. What about me? Oh you think you're too good for me.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       Deal with it. You deal with that in a crazy way. Oh, I don't deal with it like she deals with it. I like that 70 people waiting in line to deal with some shit you deal with. Ebi is like, good Lord Man. Are we ever going to get in here? Yeah. It gets a little weird but it doesn't get, it's also different because I'm a man like there's not a bunch of people looking to rape me. Right. You know what I mean? Like grape and holly Holm. She, she didn't kick you right in the deck. The deck. Go ahead and try and shut pancake that Dick here. So a couple of girls, you don't want to try and read a screen and do that hike, hike, hike, that time hitting mitts. Now I make the I holly home. The people are like, is that Holly Holm? Nah, it's Brian Callen.

Speaker 1:          01:49:00       Holy Shit. He's got the same thing. I can tell the difference when you hear the impact. I don't know man. I don't know. I got Chris, I got crisp, crisp strike. I've seen you kicked the bag and it was very sad. That's not true. That's not true because I wasn't opening up. If I open up when I open up dust or killed, well, when I do this, but my next duty is going to have a full like gym set up. I'll let you kick it out. We'll videotape. It's going to be scary, but you're gonna let me three quarter, you're going to kick and then you're gonna kick trying to do that and I won't do that. I kicked very hard. Don't make, I kicked very hard. They call me, they call me Brian. My nickname, when I find them, you don't have a dick next. I do it. They call me Brian rockhold calendar. Call me Brian the front. You don't want to stage. Well, they do that now

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       when we do the live shows, but then it goes, let's see, kick. Oh God. My wheel kick case say I need to do is get you some of these barbell jeans. He could throw up two kicks with Tom. Obsessed with those please. This is the shit man. Apparently a diesel diesel makes them too. We get to deal. I need something I have a beautiful backside get ahold of. I'm sure they follow you. All right. Get Ahold of me. Lazy. Fuck Jesus Christ. And these chairs can always just order them these chairs and let's get some barbells. Ergo depot. Let me, let me see what you were called. Pisco. Pisco. The genes. Stand out. Let me see how tight they are. I know they're not. They're not. They're tight. Dickerson Rogan has a thing. I know he does. That's not bad, dude. They're like sweat pants. Look like that, bro.

Speaker 2:          01:50:33       You're basically wearing joggers, dude. You're like Addison's job with those knees. Like no judges, no binding. Ridiculously flexible. Like you really, it's so stupid. You show off in Yoga. No, just do yoga. There's girls in my class that are a hundred times more flexible than me. This is one Indian chick and my yoga class. He does that. A bow pose where she gets her foot literally up in the air like way above her head. Crazy. It's insane. It's crazy like that. I silly. I just sit there like this. You get competitive. I don't get comparing. I don't want to blow my asshole out. So I just said, how often you've been doing this yoga. Three times a week. That's awesome dude. It's so good for your body, right, that man. Do you feel like your body, like your back's loosening up and loosen on everything? For me it's more of a mental thing.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       It's just feel great after I do it. Me Too. More compassionate, relaxed. I'm bored. I'm bored. I don't want to say I'm bored with Jujitsu, but it's, it's all the same to me. You know, like I'm going to the same guy so I wasn't feeling like, why don't you move around, go to a different job. But you go in gear. I'll know gay. Uh, just depends. I'll do both. I'll do both a lot. A lot of Gnocchi, but I'll do both. Just have you thought about doing Jujitsu competitions? Do you let them know we're not finding the time to put the proper training into it and just because of doing the podcast or to have a kid? Everything lot going on. Podcast shows everything, man. It takes, it takes a lot of time. He does dark and dicing and everything and I wouldn't want to do myself a disservice by showing up half ass.

Speaker 2:          01:51:56       Like, I would never do that. So I can be 100% that there's no way I'd sign up for one. What if like Metamorris came at you or one of those other organizations? It's like Ebi, I would help if Eddie approached me and we talked about it at the right timing. I do it. I don't know if I'd do metamorris again, just cause personal issues, but with, with, with Eddie, if like some super fight type deal. I love Eddie. If you, if he said, hey, I want you to do super fight here and it was the right time, I'd do it. What'd you fight me? What'd you fight? Cyborg again. Now when I say Cyborg for folks listening, we're not talking about Christina. Is it Chris? Christine, Christina. CYBORG females. Yeah. We used to be Santos and Justino I think it is. I think you're right.

Speaker 2:          01:52:39       Um, she's uh, uh, invicta women's 145 pound champion. We're talking about, uh, Ricardo, Ricardo Abreu, who's also known as Cyborg and not to be confused with Cyborg evangelists. He's also the number one grappling in the world. Yes. Well, he's very high. Is there a number one guy, number one, because he beat booze Shesha last year I think in Abu Dhabi. So he technically he was an absolute, he's a fucking monster fucking monster and this tornado guard, goddammit man, you watch that guy's fucking, he's, he's, he's amazing. He's amazing. And his strength and conditioning videos are also super inspirational. The crazy shit that he does that cause I'm a fan man and, and you know what else I like about him? He's like a crazy world traveler. He goes all around the world that goes on travel, so see the world and I follow him on instagram. It's really cool.

Speaker 2:          01:53:31       Yeah. Like he's like dude talking about wanderlust. Like he loves like going, he was in South Africa, he goes to Africa, he goes all these different places like every couple months is instagram is him and some new country like having a good time doing Jujitsu. Like he did. He does. He posts pictures of his girl on this. Graham, I don't know her ass. You could sit this fucking coke. Rarely she walked by, I was like, God damn, you might've got a shop shut down. But you when my man here, girl is reading, he's a big handsome so's yours by the way. Both you guys shut them down there too.

Speaker 2:          01:54:05       It's a double shot shot shot. Look at that. Oh Shit. Neutralize shop out loud. That would be fascinating. Notice he guys under that rule set to that Ebi rule set is dope. I love the fucking what we're talking about. Eddie Bravo put together this invitational tournament that Brendan and I went to yesterday and Joey Diaz and um, it was fucking sensational. Best I've ever seen. So goody this morning I said, Bro, I been a lot of Jews to competitions. I've been in, you know, high level in myself. I've never seen anything like that from start to beginning. You're like, Oh shit, this is what that's great about it. It cuts out all of the, like there's no, no one's going to be in danger. It's going to be, you know, like a total stalemate. Even if it's a total stalemate, which some of them were at the end of 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:54:56       You go into positions like you remember in wrestling how you'd start off, uh, behind someone will in this Eddie, we'll start you off. You have a choice of one or two options. You can take. Spider web. Spider web means someone's defending the arm bar, but you have both legs locked on them, on the ground there. They're on their back flat. You're inside control with one arm hooked and you are, you're holding onto the leg. That's how you're allowed to start. Ready, set, go. Can you start from there? Or the other position is you take the back, both hooks in, over, under, not under the Chin but over under it like this and they're allowed to hold on. They're defending the, they hold on your hand, ready, set, go. And then it's a battle for their, so everyone's in fucking danger. Yeah, everyone's in danger. It's really similar to college football overtime where they built, you're both in a dangerous position.

Speaker 2:          01:55:43       Whoever scores first. And then the cool thing is, is whoever got out fastest at the end and she wants, so if there's no, there's no submission. So they'll do like three rounds of it. Is it three rounds? So you bounce back and forth. One you want, you go, you go, there you go. He gets his manager or whoever taps the person first gets it. But if you go and you tap him, he has an opportunity to tap you next cause he gets position. It's incredible. It's so good. So there is, we're at the orpheum, it's sold out. There's thousands of people. They're fucking Jujitsu fans and they're going crazy. We had so much fun. Wow. It was so good for Eddie. Bravo is killing it. He's fucking killing it. It's you. Any problems? Got 50 fucking schools. Okay. I think more now I'm saying 50 that's the last count I know of.

Speaker 2:          01:56:28       I think he opened up a couple more of them all across the country has got affiliates in other countries. How about an eggshell? Yeah. Amazing. $50,000 grand prize. He's going to be a mogul for grappling for grappling. 50 grand. It's about if such a geek is about doing what you do really well and focusing just on that though, it look like I'm loving it and he's got the best personality ever. He's just such a character and he's, he's joking around while he's like referees saying funny things while he's referencing but not trying. Right. You know, like something happened and he jokes around about it. It was great. We enjoyed the fuck out of it. Yeah. It's just so nice to see someone figured out a way to make grappling really excited was planning to leave early. I'm like in an idea and it was, I was like, what?

Speaker 2:          01:57:12       Like can I get a little depressed? But that, you know, cause usually just who takes forever and it's like kind of boring. Yeah. Shit was railing well, I wasn't going to miss it for the world. In fact, I, I flew in from Vegas, I got up at five in the morning. I went from Vegas, I took the airplane to La, drove to Disney land, hung out with my family till four o'clock. God in my car. Drove to Eddie's thing, went from five to eight 30 at Eddie's fucking nuts, man. You know how you, I think on the Whitney Cummings podcasts, you said you look at Kevin Hart and he makes you feel lazy so you want to work harder. Yeah. I think you mentioned something like that. That's how you, what, this is what you do for me, like I was talking about it with someone the other day.

Speaker 2:          01:57:54       I was, I'm sorry to me about it. Let's do, yeah, I'm like, dude, what don the podcast yet, because sometimes on a, I'm, I'm still in my, uh, fighter kind of mindset where it's like, okay, Monday through Friday, do work Saturday takeoff Sunday, take completely off and then reset on Monday and then Wednesdays light days. So, you know, I'm kind of used to that, but there's none of that in this world. I'm in now. Scheduling, we're doing that web series, not when we're doing coming up with ideas, but all of this man. And then I touch you. I'm like, dude, you're fucking nuts. I can't believe you do that. And you texted me, he said, I don't waste time. I screenshot that. You're like, I don't fucking waste time. Like he's fucking, somebody wanted your number. Who was, you know, um, and uh, you were like, you know what?

Speaker 2:          01:58:34       I don't have time for people like that. I don't, I don't want to deal with that with their dues. Yeah. I, there's, there's I a lot of things and what I've found that the best way to live my life from me, I'm not saying you know, other people, some people really love their life to sit around and fuck off. When I sit around and fuck off, I don't like me. I like to get things done. But the things that I do, the recreational, they're all fun. Like Disneyland was fun as fuck with my kids. Um, Eddie Bravo, the invitation was fun as fuck. The UFC was fun as fuck my show sold out. Show at the coffee it or where they do the Cirque de Solei at mgm with Joey Diaz and Jim Norton. Friday night fon is fuck the fuck is fun as fuck too. Those are jobs. Right? But those are fun things.

Speaker 2:          01:59:15       Yeah. And you know, training, training is fun. Standup comedy couldn't be any fun. Or you know, the only real work work is like got to discipline myself to sometimes work out when I don't want to write when I don't want to, but, but I, this is, this is how I feel is harder for me to not do what I'm supposed to do then it is for me to do what I'm supposed to do. Because if I don't do what I'm supposed to do, then I deal with regret and doubt. I don't, I've done it before. I've done it a lot of when my life, I've felt those feelings, I don't like it. So what I do is I just don't do that. I just say, well what is the difference? If I don't do it, then I'm gonna have to feel like I didn't do it and feel like a loser.

Speaker 2:          01:59:52       So get after it bitch. I think it's good for just for people to hear it, to know your schedule cause you're at where you're at. You know what I'm saying? Because your work ethic. So, so for me, like if I look at someone, it's like, God, how'd they get there? Fuck man. And the schedule is insane. It's very rare that someone is successful that doesn't have a crazy schedule. And if they are, they're not going to appreciate it. They're gonna you know like, but it's, it's all like what you, what is where you're at. Like is where you're at, where you want to be. Like are you enjoying it? Because I'm, what I'm happy about the most is that I enjoy what I do. So when I'm doing, like if I was working as a ceo of some fucking corporation or something like that and I was putting all these crazy hours, like the same kind of hours, I put it now the same kind of effort, I'd probably be a miserable drunk pill popping psychopath who's just looking to escape and go bang hookers or something.

Speaker 2:          02:00:41       I'd be looking for some sort of a release. You know why you're doing it. Like I think you got to get back to the why sometimes lose motivation. You've got it. You've got to go back to the why. What are you really trying to do? You know, it's, it's like with standup, I was thinking about this this weekend a lot and, and you get to a point in stand up and you know, this is making a lot of people laugh for an hour is not really, a lot of people can do that. Are you, are you growing? Are you writing new stuff? Are you being thematic? Are you surprising yourself? Are you coming up with a whole new angle, a new idea? Or are you falling back on your old tricks? Even if it's a variation on that theme and that that challenge never goes away. Yeah. There's that feeling when you don't do a new joke because you like, you're scared of it. It's not going so well. So you go back to some old stuff, you know works and it gets a lot of pills, but you feel hollow, feel dead inside and you feel hollow. Well you can't, can't fake yourself. You can't trick yourself. No. The guys who can or monsters look terribly, don't

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       I feel inauthentic. And also when you just send them, you have people coming back to see you three times or whatever you owe it to them. I can't come up with the same bag of tricks and it's really hard to write new material. It's really hard to have a new hour and be thematic after a year. It's really, really difficult. But part of me dies when I go back sometimes in my [inaudible] old faithful just to get that laugh just, and you also have to be entertaining you. One of the things I said talk to Jim Jefferies about this. I'm like, when you do nudge him, Jeffrey's Ya Jim Gaffigan. I like when you do a new specialty, abandoned all your own material. He goes, yeah, a lot of it. But he goes, it's important for me to do news top, but it's also important for me to do well. It's like people pay a lot of money to come see me.

Speaker 1:          02:02:21       I have to make sure the show is really good and sometimes I get people shout out, they liked some of the old stuff. They want to see the old, the new, the old songs. So you'll give it to him and stuff. But with Jeffrey says, or excuse me, cafe, and I keep doing that. Gaffigan has that, would that hotpockets thing, it's almost like can't, can't do stand up without doing that hot pocket. Yeah. And sometimes Louis C k they'll yell out the bag of Dicks. That bag of dicks choke. Yeah. Yeah. Man, you missed some of those old beats and those old songs, but you, I think if you're not constantly a little bit uncomfortable, this is gonna sound weird, but I was thinking about this. I go and spar with Chris mannered and he doesn't beat me up. He doesn't hit me. I mean, it'll hit me, but I say, just don't break my job.

Speaker 1:          02:03:03       Don't please don't hit me in the nose. But I'm nervous. I'm always nervous. I don't want to go spark. I don't want to do it. I'm nervous and we move around and we'll go four rounds. I'm exhausted. I looked like shit. I get hit. I, I'm, I'm, I don't feel good. But when I do that and I feel uncomfortable and I sit in my car and I'm all sweaty and um, and you know, I, I did a bad job, but I overcame that fear on a Saturday and I went and did it anyway. Something happens where I get more creative where I just start writing. I don't know what it is, but it opens up a different camera. It's brain trauma. Maybe it's also a lack of regret because you don't have the regret that you didn't, you didn't shy away from something that was challenging.

Speaker 1:          02:03:41       Instead, you embraced it and then you get excited. The fact that he did it. Yeah, I did it, and being excited about things also is like creative fuel. I think it's so important to do that. I'm not finding that physically. I get it mentally from all the shows and our merchandise and doing all this in the podcast, but as far as physically plus class, but you're getting it a little bit out of 'em. I just realized that's a fighter and the kid tee shirt, that metallica shirt, that's our west coast. I can't wait for scrooge mcduck. There will be a scrooge mcduck slider when the kid's shirt. I will be wearing it on this podcast. It will be limited edition because warner brothers, we'll find out about it and it will be a problem. Let it sit on. The darkness is going to have to sell only with bitcoin so nobody could get money out of it. Hooks to, Oh, I didn't get the money for those. I got to, we're out of here. I got around four 30. Come see me in that at the Atlanta Improv this weekend. Thursday, Friday, Saturday. It's a great room. It's a great room. I love Atlanta. I'm doing the tabernacle there. Um, I in January, I think sold out. You, sorry. You do theaters firing the kid lives fighting a kid live. Good.
