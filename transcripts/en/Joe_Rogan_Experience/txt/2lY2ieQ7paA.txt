Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, but we are in the, you know, but also no know shut up. Right. But it's also people on both ends. Like you choosing to get upset about some really ridiculous Sheree the tweet and you go to that person's page and you go, I get it. Read someone's tweet and I go to that main page. I could put, I could add up right in one minute. I get it. I get where he was coming from. I understand why he said that. He's a musician. He's daddy's a politician. He sells this, he likes to to this today somebody hit me and I ran. He was a poor riser fan. I get it. You're a fucking book. You know what I'm saying? I've never met a Paul Riser Fan of your Paul Riser fashion. Shoot yourself in the fucking mouth right now. Once somebody said, if I go to some of these pains and I see like music and I know the music sucks, that's where it ends.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Because of his choice of music sucks. That's what if I don't see you fucking one of my three on there, like I'm gonna go on to people's that there's two things I judge people don't judge people by money or nothing. I just people that music collection. But I look at your collection. You don't have sabbath paranoid if you don't have the staples Zeplin too. Those are the stable. If you don't have a Zeppelin to, why are we here? Why Not Smoking Dope for you? Why are you wasting my fucking time? I'm over here. You got like Judy granted. You know what I'm saying? That and number two, when you opened up some of these refrigerators, there's certain, yeah, it's true. You'll open that tells me everything. If you're a fucking milk, if you're a month, if I see like low and beer, your fucking money. I ain't never come in here.

Speaker 1:          01:27          And I did certain people that um, they have music laying around just because it's cool. I'm tons of them. That's why the generation of people that want to say, and I know this and I don't hate you cause I'm kind of in the same way that they don't want to like Floyd's they prefer to listen to. Oh that's so commercialize. Yeah. Into more receipt. You know, they make you feel bad. The worst being that Tom Waits era, those motherfuckers are ones I want to punch him right in the fucking face because they're the ones you're having a good time listening to something. You're Bob and they want to like really impressed, like some fucking dumped chick with freckles or something. Everybody's fucked already gone. You know what I'm saying? Everybody fucked. All you need is Tequila and a grammar blown. She'll be sucking your dick in the fucking bathroom.

Speaker 1:          02:14          You want to be cool. And let's the Tom waits heavy winds of time. Wait, that's good singing. You want that, you're fucking idiot. But the only reason that people would put that shit on is to try to overpower you with that fucking star wars. What do you call that? The fucking thing with the mind. The mind. That's it. Oh, he's so, oh my God, he likes Tom. Wait, listen to this and they're trying to let me sit you down with a gun next to your head. You're telling me that's good. That's good. That's the Beatles. Y'All fucking shoot. You fucking put a gun to your fucking hat. All right, telling me that's good music. You're fucking 20 years old. Knock it off. Like when somebody says, I like the Dave Matthews band. I will pistol whip you.

A white dude with no shoes on and a black new planner. It fucking, it's too, it's true. Made up uncle Joey stop it. I think he's got some good songs. They bath. It's got a few good. So you got me emotional. Thank God I've got together. Fuck this shit. I was too quiet over there. I hate all that shit. Just listen. You don't like it. Just move over. I can't stand fucking time. And the people like Tom Waits, look at them and go to that page and it'll tell you the whole thing like that. That something ain't right. That vegans something there, you know, stopped the pill. Could pilgrims they care for something that you're like, really? I was like, the Tom Waits is a guy who probably has a son that I would like, but I don't want to go find it.

Speaker 1:          03:51          Oh, he's probably like one or two songs. One Song, pick a fucking song, pick a song. And it sounds like he's taking a shit. It sounds like a dude. What the fuck is this? More on singing and I know people going, oh my God, he's a revolution than I know Paul Mccartney. He's a bad motherfucker. Why? He's alive. Everybody else was dead.
