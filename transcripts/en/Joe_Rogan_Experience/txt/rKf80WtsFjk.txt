Amazon is an amazing service with hundreds of thousands of titles. It is something you will absolutely become addicted to if you are the type of person that gets stuck in traffic a lot. I've completely abandoned radio. I don't listen to anything anymore. I got a new car and my new card is supposed to have XM radio but it didn't, you know, and so I'm supposed to like drop it off at the, uh, the dealership, first world problems, anybody. But, um, in the meantime I just started using my iPhone in the car cause you know that all Bluetooth's up now nowadays and it works flawlessly. And I started listening to podcasts. Oh really? Yeah. And most of it has been this hardcore history.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       And uh, Dan, I just started doing audio books as well. I'm listening to a Carl Sagan is demon haunted world. And it's like, why? You know, why just sit in your fucking car listening to nonsense, listening to dumb Djs and radios and you could choose exactly what you listened to. I never even thought about it because I always just relied on the XM cause opie and Anthony are awesome and they're on it, you know, and I listened to them and I listened to Howard and I would occasionally listen to, uh, uh, there was like an MMA show that they did. And you know, there's, um, the, the, uh, sports guy for row, I think it's pretty funny. But other than that, that was it. I wouldn't, you know, like, what am I doing? I'm just just idly like letting things come at me. Like Channel Surfing instead of choosing your watch.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       Yeah. And the beautiful thing about audible is it's very like, it's like a really extensive collection of different kinds of books. They have the war of art, that Pressfield Book that I talk about all the time, they have the Stephen King books. They have. I mean, it's just, uh, an awesome collection of audio books and old shows. They have a lot of standup comedy on it. And a, if you go to audible.com forward slash Joe, you will save yourself some money. So go there, check out audible. It's fucking bad ass. All right, so good. It's all good. We're also bought two. I know there's a long ass every, a sponsor ads. Okay, so I'll to that next step also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o, n, n, I, t. A. And a if you've never been to on it before. There's a lot of, a lot of weirdness about that website.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       You go there and you know, what the fuck are you doing here? What's, what are you sound that's different today? It looks like you guys, you have a fitness equipment that looks a lot like weapons. You have maces and clubs and something that looks like armor. That's not what's going on folks. That's not the dolce diet part from like dolce with his ultimate grocery guide. Um, it's a company that's essentially sells things for human performance. And A, I've said this so many times that it sounds gross coming out of my mouth, but I'm pretending that there's a person out here has never heard it. And that's where, that's where I'm stuck. That's my, um, that's my motivation. And the Seattle primary cares is the new a total. Yes. The new vitamin packs that is, uh, essentially with, with a healthy diet. It's a beautiful supplement.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       We decided to go with a combination of, we put a little bit of Alpha brain in it. Um, there's Spirulina, which is God so fucking healthy for you, a really healthy vitamin C. The other listing of all the ingredients is on, um, on, on at.com as long as well as new mood. So be aware of that. If you, uh, if you take a Ssr i's, I think they have the new mood. It, let me make sure, because I don't think you're supposed to really like a vitamin pack per se. Like it's, it's vitamins as well. It's vitamins as well as, uh, other nutrients. And the idea being that like I take before every show, I take four Alpha brains for every show before the UFC. I take four before I work out. Like I, I'm a, I'm a big believer in supplementation. I think it's like super important.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       Um, what this is is just like a little bit of all the Groovy Shit. There's like strong bone, which is a bone supplement. The shroom tech immune, which is a, a fascinating supplement based on the quarter steps, mushroom, shroom, tech sport and shroom Tech Immune shroom tech sport is uh, based on uh, this quarter steps mushroom that um, they, they used in high herding a high altitude hurting populations. Notice that their cows would eat these mushrooms and be more active. So, uh, they started experimenting with them and they found out that it, I took four of them today before I worked out. Man, it's amazing the difference between when I take it and when I don't take it. If I tell you one supplement that on itself that is app, you will absolutely feel it. It's shroom tech sport. That shit is incredible. You know, it's just, it's, it's, if you're a like a hardcore workout person, you should check it out and check out the science behind cordyceps mushrooms because there's a bunch of weird quarter steps.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Mushrooms, like the type that turned ants into zombies. That's like a type of quarter steps mushroom too, but you don't want that kind, but this a shroom tech immune actually you're, it tricks your body into thinking it's got a cold and your body develops its immune system to fight off a cold that doesn't exist. It's a really interesting trickery that goes on. Yeah, it wasn't priced for, is that per day? Per Month? What? The bottles there? Their bottles total primary pack, is that what you're saying? Which one of the 2,485 for those from tech thing. Oh, that's a bottle of them. Okay. Yeah. You take one of us. I take, you could take, let me see how many is in each bottle. 30 capsules and he just got down. Just go down. Well, if you look, look at it this way. If you drink like a cup of coffee at Starbucks, it's two bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       Right. If you want to get some energy before you work out, you grab a cup of coffee that's two bucks. It's way more than two bucks, right? It's a little bit more how much? Four bucks. But I get to train to, um, I, I guarantee you that, uh, you're, you know, like the amount of effect that you're going to get is a worthwhile effect to the point where you would look at it the same way. Looking at a cup of coffee before workout, which I like to do too. It's, it has a real impact man. This, it's, it's pretty sweet. It's nice to have like there's a lot of supplements like, man, am I feeling this? But when I take shroom tech, I'm like, God damn, this is a amazing, it's amazing how much more pep you have. You know? I would like to see it measured.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       We need to do it with athletics. It's hard though. It's like you, you, you do things with athletes. You got to know like if it's the same guy, you got to know like what was his workout this week? Did he lift weights this week and not do it the other week? Yeah. How do you know like did he fuck all night that he'd go to sleep? It's like, it's hard to like completely quantify whether or not fitness supplements because the edge they give you is fairly subtle. You know, like the edge and Alpha brain. Fairly subtle. It, it actually used to be a little stronger in Alpha brain. It used to be, have a little bit more of an effect where I used to only take three or two, like a tolerance. We're not, but too many people had an intolerance for it. Don't highlight that woman's for judge.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       Yeah, don't do that dude. That's Rudy. Well maybe it's photo-shopped. She was well, she's agent. Well there's a lot of um, that have uh, those booty genetics being a rude racist. Oh, because it's stereotypical because of the earthquake. The earthquake gave him big booties on their butts.

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       Joe Rogan podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       Ari Shaffir. We're losing Ari. He's leaving the great west coast to go back to New York for the big flooding party. Tundra scheduled this summer. The flooding party of New York. It's in the way. It's an October, right? Oh, it's going to end it to happen. That mother fucker is going underwater, dude. Yeah. Try is going to be a wash. All of that beautiful and billion dollar apartments. Oh God. Fucked there. Fuck. That's going under water, man. How far up is it going to go into water? It's going to be far. Do you guys talking about the years? There is without a doubt. There's some raising of the ocean levels and uh, they're, they're going to have an issue with Lara, the increased frequency of tropical storms and a, their impact on the east coast. And it's very likely that there's portions of the east coast, especially like the low areas of New York and port cities, they're going to get hit hard by this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       The Shit we saw in New Jersey. They call that a hundred year storm, but according to Shane Smith from vice.com who I quote all the time cause he's my man crush. Um, he says that those hundred year storms are going to be placed again taking place two and three times a year, two or three times a year straight from nothing from once every hundred years to two or three times a year. He said that's the future. He said if the climate, climate change happens at the base, it's very difficult. When will that happen to time? I don't know. They could, it could happen soon, but do you mean like a thousand years? No, no, no. Like within our lifetime, the issue is that we've fucked up the atmosphere so much that there's, there's a negative effect that's happening on, um, on the planet because of it. Now it's very controversial and that's the Republicans don't want to even, it's like, it becomes like a conservative versus a liberal talking point.

Speaker 1:          00:10:34       Hi. Why don't the Republicans care? Because they think it's going to inhibit business. Okay. It's really interesting. It's a fascinating study because one hand, they have a point that the climate on the earth has changed radically over the course of its existence. And that, you know, during the dinosaur era, the, the climate was very different than it is today. And we also know there was an ice age just 10,000 plus years ago or half of North America was covered in ice. So the climate has varied. Um, so we, we know that regardless of how humans have affected it, the climate changes all the time. So there's a lot of people that don't want to look at some of the mitigating factors. And one of them is this, the heating up due to carbon dioxide and due to fluorocarbons and all the shit that people use.

Speaker 1:          00:11:29       But you know what another one is what cow farts. Oh yeah, it's really bad. But we have a lot more cows now, right? We make all the cows probably congestion. Well, if you think back though, to like maybe 10,000 years ago, who knows how many counselor were and there was also a mammoth. Can you imagine what mammoths far too? Like birds. Think about, how about buffalo? Think about that shit. Herds of Buffalo. Think about how many buffalo would be that farts. Millions of buffaloes just crack and farts all day. That never talked about that with the Indians. The old times. Well, you know, that's a real, it's a real issue in India like this, this, the population like suffers because of like anywhere you are. If you're living around that you're breathing in shit gas. Yeah. And that's what you breathing in and it's a contributor to, you know, to, to bad shit in the atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       It's methane, it's methane and it's, it's uh, there's also, there's other kinds of toxins that are carried in a, in that gas to what happened to India. There's silly, it used to be the place known for like free thinking and Zen and now it's the fucking gang rape plus. Yeah, right. They went bad. Something went wrong. So the opposite. I think it's an overpopulation issue. I think when humans get to a certain level, life almost gets devalued and they just lose their humanity. I think that's why in China, like with the overpopulation thing, we've all heard horrific stories about people drowning female babies and shit because they can only have one baby. You know there's madness. That's, that's absolute madness, you know? I mean that is, that's humanities. If once you've drowned your fucking baby, like where are you going? Like well what is this life about?

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       You've dragged your own baby cause it was a girl. What is this life for you? And I understand that we need girls to you fucking crazy asshole. But it's everybody looks at her and it'd be the ones having them, but they're also, there's so few they need like there's so few resources there. I mean it's terms of like there's so much poverty that when a son is born that song can go to work for you and that Sun can like he can take over the business. They can, you know, whereas they, they feel like a woman can't do that. Then a woman that was happening as much now that like times have changed over the last 25 years. I'm sure it has there to change, but I don't think it's changed as much as it has here. And when the pig dramas, babies per capita, no babies, cause they're like, Nah, you know I can do accounting work.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       Oh Man. There was a horrible show on HBO about people that were selling their kids because China is so poor. People would sell the kid, they would sell them up to like five and six years old. And this guy, this guy was yelling because his brother, he was five and I think his brother was younger than five and his dad was selling his brother and he's just said how he never forgave his dad because his dad sold his brother, his younger brother, man, I sold, his brother, sold them and he was like to, you know, sold them off to some fucking white people or something and wanted her baby. Oh that's not even a doctor that's giving them money. That's what's going on. You know what? People were buying babies. It's better than stealing a baby. Well I guess the whole thing is just chaos. It's just, I think it's the same issue as the India issue, obviously different cultures, but I think that kind of overpopulation is really fucking bad.

Speaker 1:          00:14:44       And My, my evidence is I feel better when I'm in small towns. Like when I go to boulder. Yeah. Or, um, like I was in, um, what's that place up in Utah where everybody goes skiing, fail. Nothing yet. No, that's in Colorado. Whatever it was. Do Your valley or some shit. Okay. We went to Utah is really small to as like so calm everybody's tribe and nice and slow. Yeah. Nothing's getting done. There's no art. There's no chaos. There's no craziness. Has No bad ass music club that you can go here. Bad ass new bands coming up. There's no comedy clubs up there. But there's also like the less of the negative impact of humans, the constant influx of information that we're getting from each other. And I think it makes you go crazy when it's too much to humanize everybody. That's how it is in New York too. It's like you don't look at anybody who's like a person, you know? Then we'd nods her head and say, hello. Yeah, New York is so odd, man. It's so odd. It's, it's a, it's an experiment in con condensation. It's an experiment and and jamming people into tight places.

Speaker 4:          00:15:45       Yeah. So many per per block. Those apartments are ridiculous. I looked at some people's apartments. I'm like, how the fuck is that? How can you make people pay for that? Then I went, I went, uh, I saw a place that shower was just opened into the kitchen, like the shower door, which just in the room and then the bathroom was somewhere else. Oh my toilet with somewhere else. But the shower just opened right there and I'm like, what do I, well it is in its price range. I'm like, no, I'll get a row. So stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:16:18       No, I finally found something. It's, I'm, I looked at some of them that my friends had when I lived there. I didn't live in New York. I lived in new Rochelle. I mean I lived in New York. I just didn't live in the city cause I had a car when I first came and I couldn't afford to park it there and I also couldn't, um, I needed to be able to drive to gigs a lot and it was hard to get out of the city. It's not that easy. So I was like, you know, and I, I shouldn't, I can't, I can't live here. But when you would tell people about it, it was like a thing of shame. It was weird that I would tell him I lived in new Rochelle and then like you don't live in the city if you don't live in the city, like they would look down on you. I absolutely remember, I remember it so much that telling you today, like when I said that I didn't live in the city, I live in new Rochelle. It's almost like a feeling of shame. Felt it you felt the thing of like, yeah, definitely. I felt the, um, uh, almost like an ad or inadequacy.

Speaker 4:          00:17:10       I have never observed a geographical bias as much as New York to New Yorkers. It's so weird. There's nothing like it. It's nothing like it. They lose 12 players. They would rate higher if they came from New York. Then from somewhere else, House Jab, Judah food as

Speaker 1:          00:17:26       Brooklyn tattooed on his back, you know? Yeah. You know, it's uh, the, the, the I iPhone. I'm, I'm from New York. Toughness claims. If you know you were in nom in this shit, that's all it takes. Flying overhead day. Just relax. There's a, there's an issue also with, uh, people that can't it up because of the weather. You're going to get that. You're going to get people cutting up, you know, the overpopulation plus insanely shit weather. Sometimes it gets, it gets bad. There's a lot of attitude there. I wonder how long it's going to take for you to get enough fight your first couple, couple of days. You've got to have that start again. Yeah. The only pick on guys. That's, sorry. That's the best way to get into fights around says try not to get hit. Yeah. Want to fuck around with big people. Yeah. Some people think that getting hits like a badge of courage, you know, take one and then I feel my own blood and that's what I get.

Speaker 1:          00:18:25       Crazy. Hmm. It seems like you're approaching this, this whole endeavor in the wrong way. Let's just talk hunter. When they're not looking at you, there's a whole a data sheet in front of you. Let's go over the numbers here. Spleen. Well, you get benefit versus cost ratio. See how my nose has no blood. So I got to talk about something because a, on the podcast yesterday we talked about this website where a, this guy, Lloyd Irvin has this a marketing website and we were making fun of it. And so he called me up today and uh, he was upset that we made fun of it. But I told him, I said, listen, we can't make fun of something that's not stupid and if something looks ridiculous, it's, I mean like you insult people's intelligence and that there, it becomes humor, you know? And his attitude is very interesting because he's a very successful marketer.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       And one thing I gotta to say, it's like it's, I don't know, like the, the guys had some, some issues. I know, but I don't know both sides of the story. I just know all the bullshit and the rumors that you hear on the Internet. But as far as like what he's been able to do, he's a phenomenal marketer. Like this guy figured out how to get like way bigger schools than anybody else has ever to do and then teaches people how to do it and it's super effective. He's the Whitney of Jujitsu, the Whitney Cummings, she, she, you love her dude. You like bring her up all the time. She's your example of like a hard worker. Yeah. Yeah. Well the dude's definitely a hard worker, but I think in that, that that style of marketing, it leaves you so open to be criticized. And I'm aware of that personally myself because of my involvement with on it because there's been times where the people at Onnit have made like an ad or something or said something and add that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       I thought it was ridiculous. So I made fun of it on the show. I would come on the podcast and we play the guide with the muscles. That was like with the girl. Remember that ad that we played? When was it 20 tech make talking about Kissing Mickey. I talk. Yeah, the guy kissing his biceps, but we don't have the other part where there was like a girl. They might have removed that immediately. Why can't we get, I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll tell RBC said, well I don't know if that weight lifted dude wants it out cause I remember his girl was pissed that I talked about and laughed at that and we met the guy. Everybody knows now I'll have Aubrey said it over. I'll have Aubrey centered over, but my point is I make, I make fun of myself. I think the only reason why someone would not want to be made fun of is first of all, you think it would affect your business, which is valid, but also because you don't want to look at the fact that what you're doing most of it.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       Yeah. Well you make it fun of me. It's like you should sign. This is what I told them. This is the other thing I told him, boy, cause I like Lloyd. You know my interactions with him have always been cool. Even though I think the marketing shits and salting, I said, you need to do this. If you're going to do these things and then give them to somebody to look at somebody who's like a critical person, it was going to go, no, no, no, no, no. Send them to me. I'll tell him, I'll tell you what the fuck's wrong with it. You, you can't make people think you think they're stupid. You can't because then you're funny because then you become funny. You become a silly person when you know you write drafts to your, to to yourself. He wrote an email to himself. He got busted like writing an email and a her tending it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       It was this expert that was emailing him and his interest. The way he looked at it was very different. Mr. Keith, he was, this is how he looked at it was very fascinating. He was like, if you saw an ad on TV and a celebrities endorsing something, do you think they really say those words? Like the reading something that someone wrote? Oh yeah, so I, I thought it was interesting, like that's how he looked at it. So he looked at it like he's creating a bit of fiction, but ultimately his product is legitimate. That's how he looked at it, which is I kind of, I see that kind of a leap. Yeah, well not really. Not really. If, if the product wasn't legitimate, I would say yes. But since the pro, I know for a fact that that guy has made a lot of people a lot of money with his techniques, I guess marketing techniques.

Speaker 1:          00:22:22       He's made them a lot of fucking money so it does work. So it's interesting that he's saying what he's saying is it like, what are you doing for putting on a show? Disney had that with, with people come out of a movie and everyone like, oh, it was great. It was amazing. And they kept out later. They're all Disney employees and it's like, oh, all the people that were saying that you're making people believe that this person is not the person misleading. Treat them like they're fools. And then it becomes funny. We had a guy on our message board, Brian, I don't know if you remember this, who was a musician and he started uh, making threads about his music under other names. It didn't know that we could find that out. He didn't understand why the people that are like not Internet savvy, they don't understand that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       That actually happens a lot. A lot. I love when people got called out on that when they're like, okay, flap, oh spam or whatever it is. You just know the type of writing and everyone just calls you on it. Well we would get that a lot when we were we people and we still do, when you ban people, you really only band there, their persona, they can always come back always like go through proxies or whatever. And then those are like the Internet savvy guys. They know how to do it. But like a guy like this musician guy was just being a douchebag. Like you're pretending you're music is awesome and you tell anybody, oh my God, that Shit I've ever seen. Like, and maybe he's a good guy, but sometimes people make shit decisions and you might make a shit decision because she grew up with a bunch of fucking idiots.

Speaker 1:          00:23:45       All right? It's not, I'm not blaming you if you decided to write a fucking thread and you know, make some shit about your music being awesome when it's really you. I'm not blaming you. I really am not. But what I'm saying is you are, you're a look at it. Look, look at your life as a mathematical equation from birth to the point where you find yourself making threads about your own music. Okay? Clearly you're in debt. You're, you're in some sort. You've not eve not balanced. Your sheets are not balanced. You're in some sort of a debt type situation where you're functioning and properly. Right? And what is that? Is it because you didn't get enough love? Is it because you didn't get enough education? Did you get enough love or education? You were abused. You grew up around illiterates. You grew up around. I grew up around religious folk.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       It's something went wrong. A lot of comics do that too though, but they're weak bitches. I think it's because I think it's whatever you think your talent level is, is not met by the, um, by the respects it's getting and it just drives you crazy. I ain't got to do something. That's a really common thing with comics. It was a cop. I remember having it myself. Completely unwarranted. When I first started doing comedy. Hi, this is Bob Smith from it. My frequency, I'm calling about artists or fear fears, a great young talent on this guy. I saw him absolutely kill. When you start off doing comedy, you never realize that you're on essentially like fourth grade, 10, a 10 year path to competence. You know? And when, when I started out, I had done all these other things, like athletic things and I had gotten pretty good pretty quick.

Speaker 1:          00:25:18       It's stuff like martial arts. So I was like, I'm just going to get awesome at this and just watch comedy. Yeah, no, you need to. And then somewhere along the line you also realize you're, you're, you're learning yourself too. You're not just learning jokes. You're learning yourself through life. Like standup is a, is a, an occupation and it's an art form, but it's also a path of life. Like there's, it's like there's, in creating anything you're also finding out about yourself. That's my theory on why beginning standups, we'll always do jokes about how they can not get laid. How they can't beat anywhere up there was give over to the Kroger but you could, you could take me sir or Ma'am or whatevers. But then they stopped saying that because they hit whatever age. You're like, oh no, I can beat a few people up here and I get laid once in a while.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       I'm not going to this little kid anymore. You get more confidence. Your style of comedy too. It's like you would never say that someone could beat you up if you thought that you could beat them up. Cause that would sort of invalidate everything else you're saying your, your whole style of comedy is like, well you might not want to hear this, but here's the truth. You know, and as soon as you start pretending one way or the other to sort of placate or sometimes, well it's new comics, all we do that, then it goes away. Kind of feel like you have to do that because you want to make them like you. It's like so bad, so bad. That's the only, that's the hardest part. In the beginning it's like just actually figuring out how to do it, how to just get in front of people and not look like a Douche bag and you don't realize what you, how do you come off either.

Speaker 1:          00:26:45       It's hard to figure that out. So while it's not, yeah. And again, I don't blame the people. I don't want to talk to them if they're bad at comedy. It's very rare that I want to talk to anybody, but I don't blame him. I don't, you know, it's like, it ain't easy. It's, it's doesn't make a lot of sense what you're doing. You're, you're up there talking and it makes people like laugh. Like how the fuck does that work? It's a long process. So a lot of the secret like what is going to be code unlock. Yeah. Well that's why classes or gross, that's why people teaching those classes are gross because you can't, first of all the people that teach almost invariably suck. Yeah. Okay. Amy Schumer's pulling up. That's the best. Uh, I told Peter Jennings class once I audited it. Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ. And he goes, I'll let you audit for free once. Mike, I'll definitely be there. Oh, sweet cheese. We pots a jokes first. You have set up, Dan, do you have set up then punchline, oh, there's a dude. What interested are you sure there's not set up set up punchline, why would you have to seven?

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       He's the only guy that I've ever actively like cock blocked from going on a stage. Yeah. I told that story was Chris Mcguire was fucking auditioning for Mitzi. Hey fucker. Amy Schumer, Michelle Ladies and gentlemen. Chris Mcguire was a auditioning for Mitzi and uh, he was going up at an open mic night and for some reason she thought it'd be funny to let Peter Chan host the open mic night. Like, I don't know what the fuck that was all about. She's so crazy. She was so awesome, you know? Yeah. I know. I don't go to a store anymore, but she was awesome. Which would Mitzi short did like her just keeping that place alive. Her creating that fucking place. The funny farm. It's amazing if you have all of these men, you've got to have one of these coco cafe. You don't drink coffee though, Huh? Is that caffeine? Caffeine.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       You drink soda? Nothing. Look at you. You fucking sexy bitch. It tastes healthy. It tastes like chocolate milk, but it's got a little bit of caffeine in it. It's so delicious. They stay sent us a fucking shitload of that stuff. Yeah. You wouldn't let them host from McGuire showcase thing. Yeah, I wouldn't. I came in, um, and I called up the comic stores had fucked that I'm hosting open Mike easily after news radio. Could have been in Fairfax, Fairfax, sure factor. So you hosted the open mic part, but the fucking with five people in the room. Oh yeah. I started the show off at four in the afternoon or whatever it was. Yes, I was there. I was there all night. It's the dregs until nine and then after them I did like 20 minutes about Peter Chin about I couldn't let them. Hey you fuck hi ladies and gentleman. This is the part of the show where Amy Schumer comes in and I get a hug. Hi Amy. We're full of Amy Schumer. Yeah, have a seat. What's up? What happened? Shit, I don't hear

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       any volume anymore on who or what are you pulling it out? Your maybe you went deaf. Ooh, I like, that's weird. The died. Did you hit the buy button? You guys hear it though? Did you hit the mute button? Oh, that piece of shit. They send us these things,

Speaker 6:          00:30:06       isn't there? Very nice. Skullcandy thank you for sending us these things. However this fucking button sucks. A fat cock

Speaker 5:          00:30:13       stupid button are cute though. Thanks. I'll sponsor like a poker player now. Oh, you think so? Let me go slow and make us look more professional. Totally. Okay, good. Super Rare. Look at this. Look at this. You haven't been to this spot. I was going to go. When you saw the Werewolf, did you panic? Oh, I freaked out when I saw it. I forgot it was. There was a little warning would be cool. This is the greatest thing that's ever existed. Really. There's been so much fucking Werewolf. I'm telling you. What a disappointment. Come on baby. You say, how long did you get your freak on last night? What happened? I should have been drunk. Oh Shit. I was like to do a lot of stuff and I was like, oh, it'll be funny. It'll be funny to be hungover tomorrow having to do all this. You think it's funny to be hung over it like shit. I just don't care about anything. That's totally like a junkie. [inaudible] yeah, you're right. I definitely skipping denial. Did you ever think that as a comic that you can't be completely enlightened or you will stop being funny? Wait that I would never be completely

Speaker 6:          00:31:39       like, you have to be a fuck up almost. She can't really completely have your shit together or you will see cease to be as impulsive, hence cease to be as funny.

Speaker 5:          00:31:47       I've no, I liked the idea that I would ever strive to be enlightened. Like I just try to not kill myself, but I just try to keep out of a depression. Maybe that was a grandiose way of explaining it, getting out of bed in the morning. But do you, I mean, you seek, you seek personal improvement, right? You seek Saturday, you see clarity, so in, in,

Speaker 6:          00:32:09       and that's, it's doing that. It's like, it's always the pursuit of enlightenment, but you just kind of always accept the fact that you're never gonna get there. That's one of the reasons why people who like claim to be enlightened or really pursuing it. Like, you know, Yogi style wood beads and robes are so annoying. Cause because, you know, and I know no one's getting,

Speaker 5:          00:32:27       it's not happening. Yeah. I don't think so. I don't know anything about poker so much. But, uh, I remember like, I think it was Jessica, some Jessica was playing poker heads up and like, she obviously had been reading the secret a ton, you know, and she was just like secret in it. And like it was just getting far. And then you just saw all of a sudden she one hand, it was just like the secret was gone and she lost it all. And it was like, no, you're not. You're like everybody else. There's no trick. You can't control life. We're all just going to have to experience so much pain.

Speaker 6:          00:32:59       What a weird notion. The secret. Yeah, it's really weird. It's really weird that they promoted that. You can just imagine that life would be different and it would become different made essentially. That's the message. I mean, obviously there's more to it than that normal talking about. I know what you say, but there's actually a lot of good thoughts, thoughts in there? Well, there, there's some interesting ideas in there, but it's also misinterpret quantum physics. Like the way they misinterpret the way, like the Observer. See, I saw that documentary. The first one, the um, the, the secret. And then there was another one like through the, through the owner.

Speaker 5:          00:33:32       The other secret. Yeah. Something like that. But they have this doctor

Speaker 6:          00:33:38       a lot of secrets. His doctor quantum thing where they show you that in measuring these quantum particles, it actually changes the behavior of the particle. Yeah. Oh yeah. Cause someone is, someone is observing what's happening. But that's what it is. It's a lie. What it is, is the measuring of it itself changes the reaction because you're measuring it with something. Oh yes. So these quantum particles or our co, there's somehow another measured and in measuring them, you change their behavior because you're interfering.

Speaker 5:          00:34:07       Measure my hangover right now. Well that makes sense. Made sense to me. Exactly. So all these people that feel like you can change things by looking at them are just crazy. They just want to be able to control everything like wizards. Well they love the idea of things being managed. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:34:22       You know, people love the idea of being able to literally wish your way to a dream. Life isn't all about control. I had a photo of a house,

Speaker 5:          00:34:31       three years living in it. Have you had to sit there conversations like that you like from real people being like, oh, this is a picture of my house I'm going to live in. And you're like, you're a Barista.

Speaker 6:          00:34:44       There was a sweet girl who was so think friends with Kelly Kirsten. She was friends with Kelly Kirsten and she would come right Kelly Kirsten's comic or could have been at one point in time, might have had one of the funniest sets have ever seen in my life. Never really. It doesn't make me an orange peel back. Hit the height. I thought she was going to write what the bleep do we know that's the book. Yeah, that's it. That's secret number two. Okay. We're sort of friend comes around and um, you know, nice person, but she's like telling every, it was a weird thing. She wasn't bragging, but she was telling everyone like, what was, what was gonna Happen? You know, I ain't going to be married. I'm going to have a child and I'm going to have a successful business. And A, we were like, okay, what, how's that going to happen?

Speaker 6:          00:35:23       Uh, do you like you have a boyfriend? She goes, no, I have just seen the secret and I have decided to live my life through its principles and it totally works. It's amazing. And I go, really? She goes, already, I feel my life getting better. I feel I'm definitely moving in the right direction. All this is going to happen. I'm completely clear, so I'm ready for a healthy relationship. When you're ready for a healthy relationship, that's when it finds you. And so she's saying all this stuff. I'm like, wow. All right. That's really cool. All right. It was a really weird, she was very nice. So it wasn't a negative conversation at all. So then I don't see her. Um, we, I, I, the last I spoke to her in that conversation, then I don't see her again until like maybe a year and a half later she comes to the UCB and I'm doing a set of the UCB. So she comes by and I'm like, hey, how you doing? And she goes, we came to see your sat. And this now I go, I go, oh yeah, I go, thanks for coming. I go, last time I talked to you, you were like really into the secret, like what's going on? And she goes, I go, I would love to hear like you progress. Just like, I don't know why it's not working.

Speaker 5:          00:36:22       Oh Man, I really thought you were going to say it like Cancun.

Speaker 6:          00:36:25       Paul out of my life that I want out of my life and my father got sick and I know I didn't ask for that because you can't control the world. It's like, yeah, you're not getting sick has something to do with you. But it was fascinating because like in the text of my life it was like, you know how like people that come in now your life, well not seeing this person like meaner, having this conversation with her and then seeing her a year and a half plus whatever it was later. And then here's the results. It was like I get to like splice the two of them together

Speaker 5:          00:36:55       and we got to hear it, but not even have to have a conversation without worrying.

Speaker 6:          00:37:01       She like a lot of people that are really into, that gets sucked into cults and a lot of people that get sucked into religions or yoga or whatever, people they get, like some people like need something to excite them to believe in some new piece of information. How this amazing I did all my life. I've been living without knowledge that I am in control of my destiny. I create my universe. God, you just want to tell the people that I've heard you before. I've heard people exactly like you before. I'm sorry if I'm not going to get into it. Yeah, yeah, but he can't be even rude if you

Speaker 5:          00:37:37       you do that. Right? It's annoying when people, they, when they find something that they're, they look at you like you're you, you don't get it, then you will or, or they feel bad for you. Is everybody all that kind of like smirk like you're, you're still where you are, but yeah, I was doing this, the meeting. You should come like that and you're like, no, that's cool. Have Fun.

Speaker 6:          00:37:59       I was doing this thing for VH one and a, there's a girl who's working there seemed so nice. She seems so like normal and friendly and uh, her sister was such a, like a, a religious freak that she, she was actually the first person that I've ever met in my life who believed in Satan and she was telling me that the reason why I can't see Satan, the saint and scales were over my eye and yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:38:22       Okay. But you really have sessions for people. Well, I'm, I'm fascinated.

Speaker 6:          00:38:26       He's, I'm fascinated by people. If I get a chance to talk to someone that actually is like that nutty. Yeah. But she, it was funny. It's like I feel bad for you. For Real. I feel bad

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       for you. For Real. You don't believe that? Wow. Can't believe you don't believe that. It was so strange cause I was like totally like dead facing the whole thing as if I was like watching like a show I like, Huh. Yeah. It just looks like serving her because in her mind, by making me feel bad, like, like, like whenever anybody laughs at you or they're trying to make you feel bad, like, oh, why are they doing? They're trying to, they're socially wrestling, you're socially wrestling, they try and take you down. Right. And whenever someone does that, it's like at that only works if you don't know what it is like. So as soon as you know what it is, then it's just silly.

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       It's just like a social cue. It's like, it's like just the most infuriating thing. And that's also their way of saying, and I don't think you know what this means.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       Yeah. Yeah. God, it's, that really pisses me off. Oh, it's one of the grossest things ever, you know? And, and, and people that pretend that they have secret information, you know, you're, you're pretending what? You've got some secrets.

Speaker 5:          00:39:32       Can you think of this one MC on the road, those working with youth? No, he's a feature and he would, um, and you would come out and he would like take his time and bring his coffee on stage with him before he would go before me. But per tenant, you'd be like, he'd lay low in the stool and he'd be like, so a woo. Where are you from? You know, like he's working the crowd and I'm just like, dude, come on. And he'd come and he'd be like, uh, come to me and be like, you'll, you'll enjoy them. And I'm like,

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       how to hear? Uh, well, I think it's gross. It's gotta be gross. You to have like these douchey guys that trip on the fact that you're headlining.

Speaker 5:          00:40:08       They're all, they all, everyone thinks that they should be headlining. They're so annoyed that that I am, and I just explained, I'm just like, okay. Yeah. I'm like, God, you should be headlining. Like, I'll just do it for the ride. Yeah. Do you want to go back? Do you want me to bring you back up? I'll bring you back. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       Why don't you just bring your own people on the road?

Speaker 5:          00:40:26       No, no, I do that guy. I learned my lesson because I kept getting paired with him. Like I, I chose Virginia and be like, oh, but you know, you try to, you try to bring your own person early in the game and they're just like, no, here's your thousand dollars for eight shows and we're pairing you with the club owners nephew. That's done it twice. He's going to do 30.

Speaker 1:          00:40:47       I've never had a road acts either one of you. They tried to sabotage you.

Speaker 5:          00:40:51       Uh, I think every, everybody,

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       everybody goes up before you is essentially just try it. It's a complex plot to sabotage. You

Speaker 5:          00:41:01       ruined. They all got together in the guy, that guy and then people who will go up the way they bring you up. If somebody wants to sabotage me, the most aggressive move is to say, I hope you guys are ready, Fara lady

Speaker 1:          00:41:15       trying to sabotage it or just not. By the way, if I ever bring you up now you know the show just so you can, if I ever area in a position to bring you up. All right, so lady

Speaker 5:          00:41:31       who likes ovaries and the crowd just prepares, you know, the board and to go to the bathroom and it's just so mean. And when a lot of times, you know, even sometimes the girls will do it like this next girl, she is a funny woman. Just all the words, the trigger words for people that make it

Speaker 7:          00:41:49       upset and angry with you before you even set, right? Yeah. Is it just a sign that they're not accepting you, treating you differently?

Speaker 5:          00:41:58       Yeah. They're all, they're trying to be, you know, they're trying to passive aggressive.

Speaker 7:          00:42:02       Yeah. Well that's how you're taking it. I think also they feel like some dudes just don't know what the fuck they're saying. Yeah. Just stammering up there low. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:42:13       Think it's aggressive. If a girl does it, it's aggressive because she knows. She knows. But then you'll let people go on after you, you know, when you, you'll like come up the MC and maybe it's someone you know and you'll make a joke about them. You know, you'll be like, all right, a great try if I can, whatever. It just has it. And then you do your whole hour and then they come back up and they make reference to what you said an hour ago. And you're like, you've been thinking about saying that for an hour. Yeah. I don't know. Uh, my best friends are female comics, so I don't know. I mean, I mean, oh, you know what it is, um, real competitive, like in a spa locker room or the gym locker room, there's just this, there's something in the air, like we're all ready to fucking kill each other.

Speaker 5:          00:43:05       It's true. I don't know why that is. And then the spa or, you know, but you know what, at the, where I box in New York, we're all like, sort of trying to like get ready after we worked out and, but then there was like this one big black check, this other like skinny white chick. And we were, yeah. And uh, and she was just annoying and she was on her phone. So anyway, she leaves and then I'm like, you know, trying to bond with the black chick. Like we all try and do it. I'm just like, I'm like God, that girl. Right. And she's like, oh, I didn't mind her. And I'm like, Shit. Yeah. I'm like, come on. And then she goes, yeah she sorta like came around, but I was like, you know, that girl was the worst so I'll reach out, you know, in the locker. But there's just like, there's just something in the air where you're just like, but yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:43:58       I don't know what it all girls or to try to improve themselves as well. It's like a self improvement place cause it's a gym is a soft fruit jam. Yeah. But you know, girls that go there, they're like, they're trying to, I'm trying to get my anger out. I'm trying to get some stuff out. Maybe it's that one. It's a little tension and aggressive environment. It's all women. A spa, relax, relax. That makes more sense than a boxing gym because you're going to get naturally get aggressive women I think at a boxing gym or a high percentage of them, like a boxing gym for men. Like for MS, more aggressive, high MMA. They, they, there's

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       some aggressive people there, but for the most part, no. Most part people chill out because they train. Yeah. When you train a lot you, you get all your animosity and anger out that way. It's like the people that are actually like some of the nicest people I know are martial artists. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. The guys who I know that, but chickson a spa. That's weird. There's just some were even like in an elevator and you can smell each other's vaginas, so it is it just you? I don't think that's it. Elevated our re dogs. What is that? I want to be the only pussy smell in the room. Are you say that, but the reason why you guys have coinciding menstrual cycles is pheromonal.

Speaker 7:          00:45:12       Yeah. What's that? Yeah. What that is going to be like. You've never talked to her toes colored pills. That's ridiculous. That's not what your nails look like. Oh my God. Yeah. I don't know. Just pheromonal though. Hormonal. I

Speaker 5:          00:45:34       think it's a chemical thing. Yeah. The, the, the hate that women have for each other is hormonal chip. Bummer. But my best friends, honestly, my favorite people to be around her are female comics. What about us? Bitch, I really take it or leave it with you guys. So rude, but true by you as well. And the cords wrapped you up. Something's going on here. I don't know. It's hard. You don't know what you're doing. My first time in it. Maybe help Jamie run in and take care of you. Just climb of there and got an assistant finger. Their son assistant. Yeah. It's don't lie to him. Works for you guys. He's the guys are saying, is that a, is that a derogatory term to say an assistant? Um, I don't know. You feel slighted? This is what I think. I think people shouldn't have labels.

Speaker 5:          00:46:19       They were going to call him red band. Do work. Okay. Let's never label anyone anymore. No. People like, like working in a place. What are you doing? This guy's just a worker guy. Just doing his shit. We're all working together. President. The guide. Starting the [inaudible] here at the Joe Rogan experience. Enterprise. You don't see color? I don't see detail. Your car. Okay, Darya. Hey Jamie. I'll have a skim. Listen, you're the one who I had to go through five fucking [inaudible]. You're going to do this. I knew I knew it. Yeah. Look, I know you're busy. I knew it was really hard and she figured out and she's like, um, she's like, just give me, I'm like, no, you don't understand. It's not going to be okay. And she's like, it'll be fine. What? She wanted my number. Yeah. I was just like, no I can't. Yeah. Well publicists are for the most part annoying.

Speaker 5:          00:47:09       Twats cause most of them are a really brutal, I missed the word Twat. Yeah, it's good to hear it anymore. But my publicist is actually a really cool guy and my last publicist is actually a very cold, no, I don't like labels. I just called my publicist like twice. Yeah. Twice. Twice. Get me an ass. Where am I supposed to go at 10. Hey, twice daily show. Come on and watch. Set it up. Is this not the daily show? Not Anymore. Oh, really? Hung over shit. I am, uh, uh, I don't drink much, but I will drink. I don't drink every day. That's what you're saying. Is that how you're rocking it? No, I can't. I have to like schedule when I can drink Jack Daniels. Or are you just an beer or, I do like, like the feeling of being a little buzzed. Just so bad for your body though.

Speaker 5:          00:48:08       I hadn't drank before last night for a while because I was getting ready for Shit. Getting Ready, getting ready to shut your show. It was on comedy central when tonight. What's it called? Inside Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer. But that was already used by someone else. I want it to be called come inside with Amy Schumer, but comedy central. Liz Phair song, hot white. It's like one of the greatest songs ever. There's nothing wrong with an ode to come. What are you talking about? Yeah, it is. It's fucking great. It's a great song. Really never heard it. These are blurred out. Was it really [inaudible] out of a gang bang and I'm like, wait, why are you so cool with believing what Whitney was telling me? Some of this stuff that you guys wrote together and stuff. He was, yeah, he's awesome. But he was saying how you have a really good, uh, uh, being able to like fuck with yourself. Oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:33       Oh yeah. He's like a, he's like, you're just not my type. And then this guy tells me he has aids on her third date. Are you, uh, are you enjoying the process? Like tell us what's making a show. It was so much work being a comic. I thought that was a lot of work. This is like ridiculous fucking difference if you get another season. And I'm like, uh, when I slit my wrists I'm like, I'm so tired. Or would you rather just do stand up? I mean, I don't know. Does that work? That much work? It is a lot of work to do a show. I like really like the show we made though. But it's so much fun to just to stand up, isn't it? It's your own show though. I'm proud of this shit. That's awesome. But I just feel like I have nothing left in me.

Speaker 5:          00:50:23       I'm like, all right, well well isn't that why you do a, so you know, you do. I'm, and then you take some time off and go to The Bahamas. Can you picture taken by in your underwear? Oops. I didn't know the photographer that I paid was there. Why am I in my underwear in the cause. You want to get some press? That would not be smart for me, Dude. Bro, you're so wrong. Listen, you need to what Tyler Durden do and I just have like my leg over my head in front of your iPhone. A couple fingers. Just do a vine myself. Like a bowling ball on this yourself. Like with the camera right there. I really don't think that that would, I think that would help me. It would help you. That would help me. You're a comic. You're not some failure. Some chick that's on the view. Our Chelsea, I've been, I just guest hosted the VA out of duty.

Speaker 5:          00:51:14       Are you serious? That's hilarious. Is that crazy? A white lady still on fucking wants to stockpile ammo. I'm just kidding. What's her name? The pretty blonde lady. Yeah, she's hilarious. I love how she yells when she's in an argument. That's the best part. She yells ports angry. She just yells or point. I wonder if they're booking me more now and wonder if I'll ever get into it with anyone. I mean, I just want to do a good job. Listen, you haven't gotten into it without Elizabeth Chick yet? No. Are you being nice or something? Come on. She's must've said something that makes you want to like go whoop. No, I agree with all of her views and I have the same views including your fears are Mexicans, Mexicans, Mexicans. What are the ones who live in Miami called? Those are the best Mexicans. I don't really like any other ones.

Speaker 5:          00:52:08       God, listen, this place feels like Mexico. This spot we're at. Just like the decorations like Mexico. Where the fuck you been in Mexico? Walls. Dead animal skulls. This is like home. This is like spring break. This is where I stay in Cancun. Did you see that video on the Mexican drug? Lord cutting his girlfriend set off. Oh, it was on. Showed it. It show the cutting it off. Yeah, with a knife. It was on youtube. He got pulled off. I think still. I'm like, why they pull it off? No, no, no. I don't want to watch it. It's super graphic. Yeah. He holds her head up to the camera and everything. My point is Mexico is fucking crazy. It is not going to Mexico. Do you ever watch, I survived where they kidnapped the guy in Mexico and they keep him, hold him for ransom. Is that as a year? And they just make them like they shoot him and they just make him sit in his own piss and shit and they'd sleep deprivation is the thing. Woo. They play that loud music. Oh my God. Yeah. You don't want your kid to have to, Mexico really must hurt tourism. Just the lid on. It's like, oh, but you might die. You might not live. Yeah. I mean, people don't want

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       to go to Afghanistan. Okay, look at it this way. Yeah. It all, I can't, I don't want to go to Afghanistan. You're way more likely to get shot in Mexico than you are in Afghanistan. The amount of American troops that have died in Afghanistan is not nearly the number of people that have been killed in the drug war in Mexico. Really? Oh yeah, it's way more. It's way more. It's like 10 times more or something crazy. Yeah. And nobody's like taking Christmas to go to, if you're partying in Juarez, you fucked up. That sounds like a guy.

Speaker 7:          00:53:56       Give your down having it Amy Schumer away in Juarez. That dude will fucking bug out being vantage.

Speaker 6:          00:54:08       There's gotta be some sort of a solution, but I don't know what the fuck it's going to be. You know, like, let's just never go to Mexico. Well, it's like, there's been times in human history where w, you know, civilizations crumbled and we're essentially watching that happen in Mexico. We're watching our neighbor [inaudible] humbling roiled in this ridiculous war where the drug dealers have billions of dollars in tanks and fucking weapons and shit, and they hire mercenaries to come over there. Is it mostly the border towns? Yes. Yeah, it's good. It's all quarterly lane. I don't know where, you know, they killed a bunch of people in Aqua Polo, Carl, so I don't think there's a photo in a, in a fucking resort. They wonder a resort and killed a bunch of foreigners. Ah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:54:50       Poor really bad. Oh, it's bad. They're touching the way it was actually no from

Speaker 6:          00:54:56       Bain. There were still silly enough to go to acapulco. Well, you know, they deserve it using this Lillian lists. That's just unacceptable. I don't know what happened. I don't know who it was. I don't know what the story was, but I know that it's, you know, the, especially the border towns, they're incredibly dangerous. Yeah. I mean it's just people going down left and right and getting know headless fucking body

Speaker 7:          00:55:15       and it's not like it was safe before. No, no safe place. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:55:20       It's interesting when a culture like drastically changes over a fairly short period of time. I used to go to Mexico and we just go straight to the spring break thing on TV in like the late nineties you know, maybe like name names, like maybe even the early two thousands it was like no big deal. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:55:36       What was it like the grind. The grind. Yeah. Maybe you and Eric were on the ground. I remember we used to get our pump on you this week. Told me how to shave my chest. I believe all of this. Sure. Yeah. Were dance partners. We're going to be the first gay couple on dances with the stars. You guys fuck each other? Just to be honest with you. For how long? For how long? Like an hour or I could watch that longer than the head cutting. What'd you write?

Speaker 6:          00:56:03       You Watch two guys. Fuck. Easier than it had never seen two guys. Fuck. Yeah, I find that hard to believe why mean in real life or on the Internet. I've never even watched it on the Internet. Pull it up for Brian.

Speaker 7:          00:56:15       I'm not, I'm not. All right. That was hard to convince me. No. Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:56:21       Brian, the only way this is gonna work. Take the monitor

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       and um, don't scream. Don't scream the show. And then on that screen over there, you need to show two guys fucking just for Amy. So well, it will never show. You can do that, right? The guys, I want it to be fine. He's going to find that mix has to flesh best to flesh. I actually invented that name. The guy's name is flash mixed master six master flesh by accident. Yeah, right. Just fucks everybody who shows up and slings. Dick, my name is cheese cream. Can I get a rap name? Well, my rap name be. I always felt like if we're going to have a nickname, can't really nickname yourself. Knowing someone tried to push their own nickname, they introduce you as their nicknames. Fuck my volleyball team. It didn't really catch on shrooms the for made your own nickname up. It means you have no friends.

Speaker 7:          00:57:24       That's the only thing it means. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense other than that crazy pub Fred's person. Hey guys, I'm going to be t rex. You know, cause I'm always talking like this. Yeah, fighters. It's hilarious. Fighters come up with some of the silliest nickname. They have to stick with it and it's there forever. Change like a Rory Macdonald, he used to call himself the water boy and then he changed his to Aries, Aries, God of war. That's kind of interesting where you're allowed to change your name change, but now I feel more like the god of war, the world, the god of war. It relates to like Mexico crumbling. I'm reading this. I'm listening rather to this podcast that explains what the fuck is wrong with the Middle East. One of the reasons why the Middle East is so backwards and fucked up. His Gingiss Khan, Genghis Khan rolled through there in 1200 something. It wasn't gangs. It was actually his sons because he was already dead and crushed Baghdad killing. They might've killed a million people. Is that people fucking gay guys talking to elderly fat guys. Fucking take it away. That's not cool. We're not going to get an honest reaction. As long as she's seen it. Now we can say that we were the first. Oh, she's looking right at it right now.

Speaker 7:          00:59:11       Okay. Put it away. We're good. We're good. No, no, no. That's enough. There's 69 they're

Speaker 5:          00:59:21       blowing each other like two gentlemen. Who Cares? I call him. I'll fucking, yeah, I don't know. I, you know what? I didn't see them penetrating each other. That might've been a different vibe, but I didn't mind the 69 you've got to prove, see the accurate fucking right there. Clearly. I thought it was going to bum me out, but yeah, fuck him. That's okay. There you go. Well thank you guys. We got to do this together. You're welcome.

Speaker 6:          00:59:49       The cons rolled, the Mongols rolled through Baghdad and the 12 hundreds and killed everybody. Apparently Baghdad was at one point in time, like the most advanced city in the world, like their science, their literature, their approach or in Islam itself was responsible initially for like all sorts of like scientific and literary advances. And it was like a booming like intellectual city and Gingiss con like sent the guy or the what? The con it wasn't Gaviscon. Yeah, Iraqi soccer con and we rocking this all when one to sent this guy a some sort of a letter, he sent a letter back. They didn't like each other. So the Mongols just came in and storm the city for weeks. They just, they would, they would hurl human fat that was on fire. They would kill people and light them on fire and then it hurl it with like a catechol.

Speaker 6:          01:00:41       So with slam onto the roofs and start houses on fire. Cause apparently human fat burns really good for a long time. Ah Dude. They would just flay fat off people and like fill up catapults with it and light it on fire. They worked fucking crazy. These, these stories of what they did, they killed everybody. Now they killed as many as 2 million people in Baghdad. It was his little as a hundred thousand or as many as 2 million. It's really hard to tell from those days, but essentially it was everyone who lived there. Most historians claim was around 800,000 which is an insane amount and the amount of humans they killed, all these people lit everything on fire, broke, all anything that was made that was any, any advancements, but through all the writing in the water and killed all the people that were there killed everyone they said to the river actually was black from the ink of the books that they had thrown in, destroyed all the writing and knowledge hundreds and hundreds of years because they're the Mongols.

Speaker 6:          01:01:39       They don't give a fuck the Mongols where it should have good kingus Khan. Genghis Khan himself is responsible for as many as 70 deaths, 70 million deaths, 70 million. Geez. Like him and the Mongols and his, his invasions and his conquering different parts of the world. They, they're responsible for as many as 70 million death. Jesus. Brian. Like what we think about like, like Hitler layer didn't have shit on this motherfucker cause this guy did it all at a horse. Okay. Does up the Annie? Yes. He killed 70 million people on horseback and kill. Kill more than 20 million. It's quite

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       a few. Really? Yeah. Fuck yeah. They all killed a lot of people. I've killed no one. What about you guys? I'm at zero, right? Yeah. You're not much of a conqueror. A couple of dogs and I was little. It's hard to wrap your head around that kind of money, man. He kneeled on durable. Yeah. Dead terrible blood was on my knee. My mom didn't want us to get away so we just put it in an empty tub and we were hanging out with the new terrible and I nailed that and they killed it. That's a wrap. That's more depressing than the 70 million dead people in Baghdad or the head shopping. You're like, wow, Amy, a way to bring it down. Oh, okay. I thought we were just showing the sodomy so lucky that there's no Gingiss con today. It seems like it's just luck

Speaker 6:          01:03:16       when someone like that comes along. It's like Dan Carlin is a name for him. He calls them historical arsonists. But like there's a very rare that you get an Alexander the Great, or you get a Gig as are you getting Napoleon, you know, or Cesar. Why when these guys come along, they just wreck shop for like 50 60 world change the world in 50 or 60 years. The God killed 70 million.

Speaker 7:          01:03:37       So you've got a drastic change in politics and people say never again campaign like a, we did like the fruit juice. The Muslims went into China. They said they killed anyone. I don't want to forget. They didn't know they killed everyone. They did. They didn't care.

Speaker 6:          01:03:54       Kill everyone. They would leave and then come back in three days and kill everyone they missed.

Speaker 7:          01:03:59       Oh, like people that were hiding him because they knew that people would hide. So I told my dad and the Israeli army, they told them somebody threw a grenade into kindergarten once they found out which village was from. I said kill everything moving.

Speaker 6:          01:04:10       Oh my God. Yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:04:12       yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:04:14       yeah, that's right. Wow. Holy Shit. Yeah. They said that the, the um, the Muslims had taken a, um, a, a crew to go into China for the first time to see what China was all about. Cause they heard all these rumors about how much money enriches were in China and they had a gigantic army and the Caribbean Shaw and they were going to go in, they were going to like, like they were eventually going to invade China

Speaker 7:          01:04:38       when they got their Christmas shows, me and Sha say, w boom. So when they go there, they just saw

Speaker 6:          01:04:45       these white peaks in the background that they thought were snow covered mountains that were actually mountains of bones because in this time in this town, this is one town, they killed 2 million people and there's one area in China. The Mongols came in and killed everybody. Like, we don't even understand what this kind of carnage must have been like when you talking about 1200 and when you think about today, like there's no group of humans that everyone's a murderer and psychopath. Like you got thousand serial killers. They're not organized serial killers. Like look at al Qaeda. I mean how many people were going out kind everyone's Terrell. Fred. I tried it. Was it 30 dudes that are fucking crazy? I was Osama bin Laden. They killed and he was living with six people in the country. At least serious raised entire cities. Just put, taking boulders. This is like your younger years ago.

Speaker 6:          01:05:39       Wait, what city? I was in high school. Uh, I dunno when I was in high school. I was thinking of saying I started but that's the guy who pulled those and killed, they killed everybody in the city cause everybody cause they protested. Wow. Destroy the city. How many people? I Dunno. Wow. But it a lot like thousands. Thousands of people. Oh Wow. This is while it's still a high school. Yeah. Well let's don't let it get out. And coincidentally, what part of the world is it? The same? Yeah, same part of the world. So he left so left people there. This is what happened to rape and get the genetics when he came. Oh, they raped ever. All the women, they say that in one part of the world and that Asia, that part of the world, more than 5% of the people that live there have gang has cons.

Speaker 6:          01:06:21       Um, them. Yeah, I think it's 5% I might have made that at home or out of his own. Please do your own Google search. Right? So game of Thrones. Yeah. Yeah. But this guy, no, he's way crazier than game of Thrones. This, this is the craziest guy in human history. Yeah. Like everybody wants to talk about Hitler. Genghis Khan was way crazier than Hitler. They would storm into towns and just kill everything out of the blue babies, women, children, rape, kill everything. Kill everybody. They would take people and cut their skin off and force feed it to them until they died. They would do on skin. Yeah. They do the, they, they killed people and yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:06:56       What have you met her if they were eating somebody else's skin? Some of the low, I think I might rather eat my own skin. Then a stranger he would send like even you and I know you. I think I'd probably still rather get my, my Mayan skin. He looks delicious. Oh, he does? Like he's, Oh, please. He's adorable. What about

Speaker 6:          01:07:12       guy though? Fuck. I would be very tender that you barely knew. Yeah. What about fat woman? I'd be more tender. No, I can't eat a family. Yeah, you'd be filled with like a cigarette. He tastes, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:07:21       Ah, that's smoked. Smoked flavor. You might be right. That might sort of help this. You don't know til you try it. Yeah. Brian cut off some skin. Okay. Yeah. If we were to cook one of us, I would want to cook. You me? Yeah. Why? Most muscle? No, I just went on my instinct. What do, what do you think? Yeah, I was going to say Brian for for most meat, but I don't know what makes most meet tough to chew on. I know, I know. I think it would be good. Definitely want to be Jamie because he's the one that he's doing this. How is this? Sure, Dan, this. Yeah, if you had to, if you had to a, if you will like trapped, uh, in like one of those a Yukon things where you got to eat someone university of Connecticut. No, no. Oh right. That makes more sense. Don't kill people in Connecticut. Need them. Why they're so boring. If it was like the Donner party, there was a couple when we were traveling

Speaker 7:          01:08:16       from north, that was from Connecticut and you could see these motherfuckers from a mile away and Joey Diaz and I would look at him and I actually said, I go, I go look at these Connecticut white people. I go look at them like that. I think you could just tell. And he goes, he goes, how can you tell? And I go, look at the kids' shoes. The kid was wearing boat shoes. Oh boy. A young boy, he was like 10. And he's wearing boat shoes with shorts, with a belt on Beltane shorts. They don't grow up around enough black people that they have fear in them. So they just do whatever they want. It's like no Portland, they're missing character. No, it's worse than Portland. Way Worse Portland's way better than Connecticut and Connecticut. You have all these like weird rich dads that had been stealing money in the stock market the whole life and they pay for these kids to go to private schools where they all stare at each other cause no one's getting any education at home because your mom's on pills and her face can't move cause she shot botox into it and she's fucking Disney all day cause she's got a Xanax addiction and all of you to stare at each other.

Speaker 7:          01:09:09       Just handled little whales on them cause you think your alternative. But really you're just a rich little piece of shit. You have a crest on your, you're crazy and you're going to start fucking your male friends just cause you're so bored from your weight and title life and your wife hates you. They were all traveling together. This, this woman didn't understand why she had to take her shoes off. It was hilarious. They were telling us where this bitch has been living, but she goes, my shoes are open toed. You can see my feet and like, you have to take your shoes off. I belonged to equinox. Do you understand? It's like literally arguing with her husband. She's like, it's open toed. I think you can wear them over their husband. Like, what's he going to do fucker in the face or at least passes out and just wakes up a learned person. Well, I can't do that again. Uh, he was tired at that point. Oh, we ain't breakfast. It was about to crash dog. I'm like, God, him in Connecticut. I'd like to see while we were in Jersey too, which is the, it's, you know, it was a, it was Connecticut. People in Jersey and Joey are going to Phoenix. Oh, you're doing that?

Speaker 7:          01:10:20       Two of us at night by night. Thursday night. Please come on that week. The two of you come down that week and we'll blow it up. Oh, it's next week. Okay. Come on.

Wait, what fuck is going on? This winter was a joke. It was because we don't really have a winter bad New York sucked to this winter. I, Hey, the weather, you know what he's like decided that la people are too shallow. That's how you feel judged. What happened? And he's tired of bad about, uh, about the business out here. New stages is good and you know, a new people, new experiences, experience. Well comics to watch, you know, new styles of comedy. Oh, that goes into my train of thought. I want to go, here's my theory. A little bit of like 5% once a day to a black check for like two months. Harlem shake. Yeah. Here's another party. You marrying a black church and after the black chick doesn't work out, it will get the Julius.

Speaker 8:          01:11:41       Oh, he married your mom. You Shit your pants again. I'm not cleaning this.

Speaker 7:          01:11:49       You mind if I introduced Mike, that girlfriend to you? I would just be ashamed. I'm like, here's my girlfriend, a viva. Viva. What happened? Bam tapped out. It's named after hand sanitizer. Yeah, you found it. Yeah. That's not good. Have you ever got that lecture? No. Shit. No. Oh, I'm going to and uh, I know some of the black guy. We should push it. I have it set up earlier. I don't know. You have it set up like you said. Hey listen, what a fuck. A black chick and you're black chick. So what's the secret? It's a secret secret to the world. He did. He used a secret. Smart. That's a beautiful thing. That secret. It really seems to weed. That'd be funny if you're inside of a house and a family like you, just secret like a huge black cock guide was the Black Hawk sit like 10 minutes and meditate guys visit.

Speaker 7:          01:12:50       So one day, one day a guy breaks into your house at the exact moment he's here. How racist. I just assume that a guy would have to break in your house. Really funny. Really funny to picture a Connecticut woman sitting in her home like, oh, you made it. And like she thinks this guy is going gonna fuck her. And he robs her. That's great clubs or over the head. That's great. Cut your finger off to get her rank cause it's stuck on that thing cause she doesn't ever take it off cause she's embarrassing. Meant that she floated, she did our finger washes, eats everything. Whenever you can't take it off and blood diamond on her thing, she has to hack it off with a chainsaw. Hey, there's no way. It just won't do it. Not Quick enough. Meanwhile, she just wants to Black Hawk. He didn't even know that we're giving it to her, but he's going to take her shit.

Speaker 7:          01:13:38       Awesome. Didn't go fantasy and then be like, oh it's been working out at all the way I want. Isn't it funny how that would be horrific for one person, but yet another chicken? Yes. Yeah. He'd be like, Oh this is my fucking day. Yeah. Finally some gangster Dick. It's do it. If you don't, you don't. With black blackjack. If you, I've never been with a black check. One, two, three white so far. But um, I, you know, I hope to branch out. Yes. What about like any of the, uh, alternative races? I've been Asians, the FMLA, I would, I'm open to whatever I, yeah, sure. No, I think if you've never dealt with anything but white. Yeah, no way. Yeah. Wait a minute. First of all, why would you assume she has this such an extensive sexual background? Because of her act? She's a cat. She seems like the type of cow that guy sits a fucking gets to know her. Any hangs out for a while. Jesus. Whoa. She wouldn't have a bunch of different relationships if I want to sleep with someone and happens real quick. Like within an hours. Yeah. Well there's nothing wrong with that. I Know

Speaker 7:          01:14:36       Ryan and I were talking yesterday about the different girls that we dated for like like a long time ago. Windup slept with him the first day [inaudible] relationship, but yet to use it as a bargaining chip. It's just like, yeah, well, you know what? That's because you don't have anything else to offer. That's usually what that's all about. Or maybe I've friends that just seriously aren't ready and they need to really trust someone, but if I physically am drawn to somebody and I want to sleep with them, I gone wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. There were, the problem with that is it too many people in the world are assholes and so that doesn't work out well because every now and then you fucking asshole and then you've got an ass hole in your life. You're like, ah, yeah, she got to know this person better for,

Speaker 5:          01:15:14       yeah, you're right. Then then you're done with them.

Speaker 7:          01:15:19       Get to know them like you introduced them again. You have sex with him again and again, and then you start hanging out with them. You get to know him. Then you go, oh, okay, I should have got to know you better because I'm not really into your personality. Right. I would rather have known what a piece of shit you are because that's the worst, like chicks getting dressed and she tells a nigger joke and you're like, oh,

Speaker 5:          01:15:36       oh wow. Christ. What wasn't even looking for reactions. You were saying it casually and unapologetically. Yeah. He's like, you know, they are. You're like, oh, okay.

Speaker 7:          01:15:51       Not, let's take away the plan to meet. My parents had sort of already blown them because then at least you can get that in. You can't do it after. You know that. That's a good point for a guy, but not for the girl. I Dunno. For girls, not such a good point, but I mean sometimes you sleep with someone as a girl and you're not, you're not interested in building something with them. They just want some sick. Yeah, that person's Day. Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. Does absolutely nothing wrong with that. I feel okay about it. The problem is it's too many people that will let you think did something wrong with that because they actually want to fuck you. You know? Especially girls, girls take so much grief from guys that really were attracted them like fucking whore. She's just fucking whore.

Speaker 7:          01:16:30       It's kind of gross, right? You guys, because they're weak. They're weak. Bitch ass bodies don't realize that terrible feeling that they're having about this person is discussed. It's really just rejection, rejection. The fact they were ignored. You know who else does that? Other girls, those, those that say, you know what happened, but with the Ohio case, that's Steubenville coast with a girl was being dragged like other girls are calling her a slut. Oh, makes me so mad. I did nothing to help that one graphic. That's terrific. And I can't say the same thing at their competitive nature or something. Wow. The thing about Amy talking about chicks wanted to kill themselves in the elevator or each other. That's how you paraphrase. It doesn't work. That's why I can't trust the member. When Amy, she wanted to throw herself

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       down an elevator shaft on, no, no, I didn't use my own pitches with elevators. I wait. Hold on a minute. I don't think I said that. Yeah, that's doable. Thing was really upset, really was, well, what is that? Is that the family? Is it the people not talking to people about the opposite sex being human culture, whole high school. It wasn't just one family. Yeah, you're right. Not only the high school, it was actually the adults because they were hiding it because they didn't want it to fuck up the high school. It really is like crazy. It's everybody in the community making these guys feel invincible and untouchable and you can do whatever you want your gods right now you're got so crazy and I was his girl just really drunk and no one did anything to help her. Ooh, Jesus Christ. That's a ooh human nature.

Speaker 5:          01:18:03       It's not like about this one coach and do anything. You know Lars von Trier movies that I think about that all the time, like just if, if humans are given the chance they will become complete monsters. I think that's probably true. It's certainly possible. It's not fun to think about, well, look at this fucking Mongol thing we were talking about, there was not even a thousand years ago. This is, this is heart of darkness is every movie. It's all about like if you take away society back to animals and more terrified of that. I mean we're all tear up. That's where my, these, the mad max movies and Zombie movies is essentially the breakdown of society are terrified of women were just saying about that girl. Like everyone, the girls are scared. Like if I side with her then the guys are going to turn on me. And it's like, and I think in the Muslim side, the way they like cover yourself and you know, it's like people have this fear and people get upset about somebody saying like, yeah, I'll sleep with someone when I want to somehow can make a failed castrate it for some reason that I would maybe make my own choice.

Speaker 5:          01:19:07       And I think that uh, it's being raised by week bitches too when he's growing up that not every woman he likes, it's going to like him. And you got to realize that it's not their position to like you. You have to suck it up and either improve yourself as a person, get away your whatever deficits or find someone who does like you gotta be worth something. You have to actually have value. You have to be fun to be around. You have to be enjoyable to talk to. But people don't think that in the beginning. They just want you to like them. Especially like spoiled people. We know like spoiled Shitty dudes who like their dad. Like they can do no wrong. These kids, they show up and they're fucking assholes. It

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       is guys and girls versions. I mean let's just call a spade a spade here. Well this is what this guy was talking about. This is why it's fascinating. The Mongol thing, because he said when Baghdad was raided by the Mongols and they crushed the society, they basically started from scratch after that with the people that were in the outskirts. I mean that is literally what happened with Baghdad. They had a repopulate Baghdad rebuild everything. He killed everyone and through all the literature away so that they see that today they're just getting to the point like culturally of where they were in 2012 and I bet a lot of those people were like, let's not go in right away to the city. Let's wait another three days. Yeah. But it's also like the distrust and like they were, I started reading about it after listening to this cause it's so interesting.

Speaker 6:          01:20:58       I was like there's this people that equate the whole distrust of foreigners and the outside world to being invaded by the Mongols that apparently the Muslim religion and Islamic culture was completely different back then. And it was like the Greeks, it was like the Romans. It was like people that were like, you know, actively trying to pursue education and enrichment and science. It was a completely different type of culture or either where they, I mean they thought they had the greater army, the, the, the, the, the walls too. They thought they had the greater army, but they didn't understand how gangster the Mongols are. The Mongols were throwing trees at them. They cut all their trees down. They took two weeks, they cut all their trees down everywhere, all around the city. And then they stack them up with giant catapult and hurled them over the gates destroying everything in the city.

Speaker 6:          01:21:47       So imagine Taylor, the Hobbit, 12 a d and you're sitting there full size palm trees, whirling or destroying mosques. And they did this, by the way, for two weeks before they started to go in just launching, launching fiery shit at them, launching, launching things, raw, launching rocks. They collected rocks, launching them into the city. So they basically over the walls, everything's getting pulverized, everything's getting crushed that can't go outside the gates cause they keep, they can't get more food, they can't get anything. And these motherfuckers, these crazy savage barbarian sociopath's on horses with each guy at a horse. And then they had nine extra horses. So there's hundreds of thousands of animals and people outside your gates and they're hurling trees at you just waiting for you to give up. And everything's on fire. Everything's on fire, everyone's dying in front of you. And then boom, they come in and when they come in they just cut down everyone running through the streets, cutting people in half everybody they find dead.

Speaker 6:          01:22:53       Everybody hiding dead. Everybody in any mosque dead just come in chopping heads off dead. And they, they would do this and they would completely clean out an entire area like they changed entire course of human history. They weren't, they weren't looking to take survivors, survivors. If they took survivors, it was only because they were at war with someone else and what they would do is take the survivors and put them in the front lines and use them oftentimes as the the front who would push an army into the town and people would be shooting arrows at their own friends because their own friends would be forced to be at the front line of this army behind them. They would see the Mongols on their horses and these people would have thousands and thousands of people just be forced through the door of a, of, of a, of the gate of a, of a city. Sure was insane times, man, I love this stuff. Oh Man. It's incredible. It's just so fascinating to know. I am. I love watching the broad spectrum of people in this life that we encounter, but this is this, this life. It's so interesting to see that people just like you and I were living in that world. It's like it's, it's just, it's the same species, the exact same species as you and I are dealing with all over the world. It's just, it was a thousand years ago. It's the same thing. I think we would have been

Speaker 7:          01:24:08       bad ass is then you would have been dead or rate. We'll like, do you have an extra leading up to all leading up to my rape and yes, of course I do. How good am I gone on one to 10 my voice is a 12 and you know it. So they kept you around and then what? You would have become more than Gingiss cons. Wives. All right. You could be the funny wife. I'd be like, you guys did. Have you heard this one? Remember when he killed that first 30 million? Well listen to this one. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, it'd be good to have in Washington. We're just so lucky. We live in the the e everybody's on phone. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:24:44       this guy does suck. I mean the world does suck. I mean, there are things that happen like in Boston when these two assholes, but there's not 100,000 of 'em on horses storming into Boston

Speaker 7:          01:24:54       telling everyone you ever heard that Mel Gibson movie showing everybody made was wasn't innovation Apocalypto yeah, with all the Gringo get the Gringo, the beaver, the beaver beaver, they shot and then he went crazy and they're like, fuck, what are we going to do with this? Well, they had to know he was crazy when they're shooting that and, but I didn't know if he would go bullshit. This shit over there hadn't gotten out earlier. They should, I guess it had celebrities are protected while he had that one, a shadow where the cops pulled them over when he started ranting about Jews, I'm not going to do, oh, we were all like, yeah, we kind of see that. That's the sign of a real crazy person when you don't, if you're getting racist, but straight to Jews, that's like, that's true. I mean, that's not just like you're skipping over, you know, but even though you're a Jew, I fucking agree with you. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:25:43       absolutely true. You know, people might discount that because of the of your, your Judaism. Judaism.

Speaker 7:          01:25:48       I think it's true though. It's so true. What is something about the conspiracy folks who've always go Jew build a burger, let's build a burger. The badges out controlling the world's economy. You don't even know. I don't know, like build a bear, but with hamburgers. Yeah. Not Build a bear for the Burger. That's a good idea for you. Build a burger. Like make it look like a bank would take over an old bank

Speaker 6:          01:26:10       and turn into a burger place where you build a burger and everybody wears like fucking Richard Nixon masks and all that.

Speaker 7:          01:26:17       No, no. Look, look, look like you're in a cult.

Speaker 6:          01:26:21       Do you, um, did you ever hear Bohemian Grove? Do you know this real thing that they actually do? Really interesting. We're all the world's top like financers and bankers and world leaders. People from all over the world. Like the Bush family's been going to this place forever and they know it's called. It's called, um, well the, it's called Bohemian Grove and the APP, the thing that worship is called Molek and Molek is this our God and they burn a, they have a sacrifice. They burned in effigy. Like Alex Jones is crazy. We all know the Alex Jones is crazy. He's a fascinating dude. You know, he believes that it conspiracy and everything, but he actually snuck in and got video footage of these fucking rituals these people do. So you're having all these world leaders and they're wearing robes. Alex Jones slipping. Not even one of his guys. They didn't know who he was back then. He was, he was nobody back then. And I think he actually got caught. I know if he got caught, he saw them all like Brooke doin well, they had hidden camera footage of these fucking people going through this uh, this ritual. And it's like these people there are there weird fuckers, man. Yeah, they really do do weird shit. That's like conspiracy theory shit. Like, like the skull and crossbones.

Speaker 7:          01:27:30       That's real. It's really weird. Yeah. Like the juicy Kubrick's eyes wide shut. Yes. Apparently that's like based on real things that some of these weird groups do. Oh really? Yeah, they're just so rich and board all do Kabbalah. Also the type of checks that you can bang it off. You're in one of those mass parties in Greenwich, Connecticut. Oh my God. Are we going to get a 32 year olds? Gigantic fucking huge ballroom. That's actually a part of some guys manner and you all show up and give the keys to the Valet and put your mask on.

Speaker 7:          01:28:16       Especially because if they really are complicit in some shady shit, whether it's they're doing like scams and stealing money or whatever the fuck they're doing, you're going to want the person who's with you to like to be all in, you know? And if you, you know that you like their waste swap in and you're part of some crazy group like you're, you're, you guys are fucking each other. Yeah. I mean you guys are living you. Everyone's living in this crazy, you know, you're going home power on me. You want to fuck your friends wives that to fuck your friend. Well don't they always. Whenever someone, when they're trying to get people into elite groups, they always like make you do shit that you don't want to do. Like that's a big part from the crips to rich. Well it's like, yeah, if you want to be a part of a group, you got to sacrifice, you get something, you got to prove you're down while we're to shoot somebody just because they're flush your lights at me just do it.

Speaker 7:          01:29:12       Does that thing in game of Thrones where the Khaleesi is like she gets, she gets this army and they all to be a part of this elite army. They all had to kill a baby in front of its mother. But that's like standard shit. Like throughout history, you're going to be a part of some crazy group. You got to do something nutty. So these people that are like fucking rig in the economy and stealing billions of dollars like these east Hampton cunts, I wanna just go to one of those parties. I just want to see a dragon. Like there's a part of me was like, I bet there's a drawing in some way or do you think there's a drag? Dragons used to exist? Like why are there so many dragons in human culture? Oh, I hope so. God. Yeah, cause it was dragons. Not just in China, but there's dragons in Europe at the same time. I think they were dragons. Look, I'm not some return. I don't think they were Unicorns, but there were,

Speaker 5:          01:30:00       right. Yeah, I know.

Speaker 7:          01:30:03       Do you think they breathe fire or is that just a breath? No, they breathe fire. Well, the Komodo dragons, those are nuts. Maybe because Komodo dragons, if they bite you, even if you survive, like you're going to die from the saliva. The toilet. Yeah. Massive. They have a botulism in their saliva. Yeah. They were just, their mouths are fucking the worst. Just festering bacteria. I think you'd probably run fasten you. Yeah. They're the biggest lizard on earth next to, I think they're actually even

Speaker 5:          01:30:31       bigger. The Harker picture yourself, Bob. We can, we'd get behind a tree. What? I catch them around corners. It's like, and you don't make your songs the sooner the Lizard. Yeah. Bigger. But aren't they bigger than,

Speaker 7:          01:30:44       so how has the Komodo dragon the biggest drag? The biggest lizard? I don't know. Are they bigger than crocodiles? I think so. Can you guys watch my television show tonight? Fuck yeah. Bitch. 10 30 and comedy Central Police Watch it. Um, and it's called inside Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer. This is what he said that he had me laughing when you're all doing a spy scene. Wow.

Speaker 5:          01:31:04       Oh, the shows, they always like the guys get to do cool shit. And the girls are always like, all right, and you just have to suck his dick. So here's what we're doing with the mission. Yeah. But where'd you, everyone had a code name? Yeah. Yeah. It was like all super bad ass. And then mine was butterflies. Butterflies. Creepy eating a deer. Oh Wow. That's a Komodo Dragon.

Speaker 7:          01:31:28       Sorry. Yeah. Wipe your mouth. There are monsters. Komodo dragons. Hawkin animal man. God, I bet there's some, I bet it could people in Connecticut on those. Oh, look at this with a, they're feeding together on a car.

Speaker 5:          01:31:43       Oh, that's like walking dead. Yeah, exactly. Like walking dead. The ones getting over the top when I looked at it by accident and I want to go hang on, just

Speaker 7:          01:31:51       pulling chunks out of this thing. It's ruthless fucking animal. How many babies or shoot, 10 10 episodes. All done. Ready? They're all done. So you go on vacation

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       now. Well that's, I'm going to put to New Orleans for a month. Nice and right. I ain't getting new new new writing. We'll get that thing standing up on a time lags pulling that deer out of a tree. What if you see that coming out of here? Maybe they hung it. So whatever the fuck it is, maybe they hung it so that people can, uh, see it either right away. And then, I don't know what I would do after that fucking day. Chasing after you did it. See the thing is, maybe that's where the idea of dragon's came from. Cause they're, bro, they like fire and that breath, but it's really just that they're there. So live as fucking toxic. You know, I feel like they would have found a bone or something. Fire-Breathing bone. Look, they breathe fire. Trust me. Could you imagine if there wasn't an animal that actually could breathe?

Speaker 5:          01:32:44       Fire? God Damn. Monsanto would copyright it. They would go here and be like, it's ours. Yeah. They'd be like, we own it. And then they would just have fucking fires and weird cities for no reason. Like all of a sudden Detroit's on fire. See Dragons walking through the fucking streets. Well, if you're going to light one city on fire, that's a good spot. Oh no, that's not what I was saying. Oh, magic. I think a crocodile is technically a reptile. Yeah. Don't know what the difference in reptile and Lizard is. Think there's a difference. I think that's why, because I don't believe that crocodiles are large or large. It was a snake. A snake is a reptile as well. You know towels. Crocodiles are reptiles, so they just kicked in. Amy, we're here for you. We're giddy because you're, you're, you're awesome. And where around Jim Narcissism.

Speaker 5:          01:33:36       I will believe that you really mean we, we were Giddy to have you here. We're very excited. Why don't we get to see you like once a year or something? Every time I come to la I ask us to come see you. Let's try to do things more often. He did one night Moontower that the festival in Austin. Is that a comedy festival? No. How's that work? Is that like south by southwest but they don't pay for Shit and they just pay for shit south by southwest sent me something. It was hilarious. We will pay you a hundred no, no, no, no, no, no. It said we will give you a free pass to go see other shows. It's worth $1,500. They price that way cause they give it out to everybody and they don't give you a companion pass. I've thought it was the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard of it.

Speaker 5:          01:34:24       It's not cool. And they end, the shows are all sold out at south by southwest and in return they will give your email address out to everyone. I have still been getting letters saying we'd love your band. I had to beg for hundred where you'll have your band. Really, you get there. They're like, can you flyer for this band? You're like, why does anybody still do it? Because it's a cool festival but it's kind of less go way more like this. It's a burrito stage now. It's becoming way more corporate Rido stage. Those are delicious. I listened. I'm not on Doritos. I

Speaker 7:          01:34:57       love the fact they've moved into Taco bell and started taking over with the cool ranch. Great merger. What a great merge. Amazing. And it's always good for you. So good for you. People don't know that you're really good for Ya. Austin is the fucking shit. Yes it is. It's almost worth dealing with their bullshit just so you can go on stage there. I just don't like the idea of them make a Dunkin made a whole video about it. Don't get were pull up Dunkin's video come out. It's hilarious. Yeah. Pull up Duncan Trussell on south by southwest. Yeah. Cause he made a whole video about it, which like really kind of encapsulated it in a whole area. So that's how I realized I was doing it last year. And then like most show was like, I was like, you're not doing, I thought you were doing south by cause.

Speaker 7:          01:35:33       No, I switched on the pages. I was like, Oh yeah, I shouldn't be on that one. It's not a greedy thing. It's just like what is justice? What is the festival about? It's about art. Okay. How come the artists aren't getting paid? Like who's getting paid? You're making a salary. You're making, are you guys make a profit? Like how's this work? People here who've paid to get in so people paid to get in and where's the money go? Does it go to charity? It goes to charity. I kinda get it. But it's got to all go to charity. Yeah. That means you can't get paid either. They're giving you the salary. Ah, no, no, no, not this one. Not this one. This has been done a billion times. Go to the cloud one. Not this one. The clown one. Yeah. Don't do the fucking Hitler One. It's so stupid. It's not even a real Hitler be one thing. If it was like footage of the real Hitler getting crazy, that's like an actor playing Hitler. The best of all those were watching him with, with Jeff Ross. And so who else are the parking lot? But although the good folk Hitler on that, on that scene, they just resell title ever. They're crying. They told me I'd have to pay for my airfare and hotel and then I wouldn't get paid to reform. I decided to call a clown and offer her as similar deal.

Speaker 9:          01:36:38       That's really funny.

They had, but they had offered us all, but we just like couldn't, nobody took, okay. Yeah. That always gets like know what they fucking, they offered it.

Speaker 7:          01:39:32       Yeah. They were like, no, it was bad press. Like you have no women's like Oh Fox. Like to called Chelsea. Like, Hey, can you come down and you go, yeah, you're paying me. I know why you're calling. Yeah. And they're like, fuck fine. We'll pay you on a stage and age. Some people she demanded it and it was like, yeah, they have the money. I don't Larry. Yes. That is so funny. Wow. That her being like, but you have other aren't their local cloud. That's really what we are. It's actually a speaking opportunity. Oh, your resume. That's how they look at it. It really is like just a total, it's a chance to break as a musician and south by southwest, but not as a comedian opportunity man. Oh that's so funny. He was a 45 minute discussion and he can receive a complimentary gold badge, a $1,350 value.

Speaker 7:          01:40:24       We will give you an interactive sessions, events and express. Yeah. It was like our rate of one night. [inaudible] funny actually, I guess they offered me a hotel as well as hotel access. That's a very ambiguous because I what it means, it means you get first in line for a hotel. They have all these people that they give hotels too, but they only have like 200 that means you're allowed to pay for the hotel. Oh, that's hilarious. Hotel access so they can make sure you get a hotel, but you pay for it. Yeah. Oh that's so cute.

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       Cool. That's so hilarious. Oh my goodness. People are so fucking crazy. Yeah, but Moontower was cool. It's, it's an interactive session panel. I guess it's not even doing standup. Taking a 2.0 bitch, you ain't going nowhere. We locked you in. We're in the valley. We are in the valley. You can't go. What are you going to go? You get somewhere better to go. We got here. They didn't do a good bullshit shows. This is promotion. This is helping you. The Amish inside. Amy Schumer tonight through live tweeting, tweet it, tweet. I'm like, he's playing dumb cause he doesn't want to do it. No, he doesn't really do tweet. It really is retarded. But you know where he does. He does Facebook. I've ever seen his rants on Facebook are hilarious. She is the funniest you. You would love him.

Speaker 5:          01:41:51       We hung out together in a, in Canada together, inflammatory waits for the responsible until somebody takes it seriously and then just goes back and forth with them. Meanwhile, starting a new inflammatory posts. Put them. He's just on there nonstop jokes. Well, it's a good way to right? You get a fat supply. Retards. He didn't know him and I just read them on Facebook. It's a crazy person. One of the writers forwarded me that. Kurt was responding to comments. He was actually was responding to comments like, it's really important out of women, women comics, there's probably only 10 ever that are really funny and you're one of them. You know? That's crazy. How many women even had been funny ever being a dickhead? Let's say. We can think of a bunch right now. Felicia, Michael's, Joan Rivers, rivers. There's a bunch of fucking hilarious. She's fucking hilarious. That girl does not get her do really funny. That'll shock you. Go see her. There's a bunch of girls we never heard of. I'm sure. I'm sure. But how many countries there? A hundred I now know that are good. Seven.

Speaker 5:          01:43:44       Seven. That's a random number we judging funny because Rocky Lynn, I know you're funny. You're funny. Funny he said, but, but he was like, like, I was like, oh, how was his set like to ask you about a comic? And he goes, he kills. And I'm like, yeah, what was he funny? He goes, respect the kill. And I was like, okay, Somebody's lame that is killing and so many land that's bombing. I'd way rather have somebody that's doing well. You can watch a tell like kind of bomb once in a while and you're still like, this is the funniest shit I've ever seen in my life where he's just always fucking around and coming up with new shit, you know, if he wanted to. But it's always hold at classics and just slaughter isn't, oh, he's so fucking funny. Well, it's another way. He's, he's a real comic, you know, there's not so many like real comics.

Speaker 5:          01:44:32       There's a lot of like weird people that you have to hang out with. Why you're doing real comedy. Like the guy who was one of the actors, the guy was opening for the annoying to what you were just talking about earlier, who you'll enjoy them, enjoy them. That's not a real cup of coffee. Coffee. That guy's a dick. Wad totaling up. No, he was probably 45 even better older guys that are featuring and then I'm like, Ooh, Ooh. It's like, yeah man, you're great. Then the more they like say they support you, the more you just see the venom. Like, no, you're great. Yeah, my kids love you. You're like, you want me to die in the parking lot? There's always those weird older dudes used to be at the store that always used to give the vet. Those guys that have been around a long time and they could barely feature on the road. They barely even featured on the road to success. You're really successful, but people don't, people aren't mad at you.

Speaker 5:          01:45:28       Well, I guess I'm in New York, but I never hear of anybody hating on you. Pretty Nice, but people are nice that still just get shit because people are upset about it. There was an opportunity to talk. When you're talking on the podcast, people get a chance to like if you see somebody, yeah, you see somebody in a movie, fuck that guy. That guy's a piece of shit. Fear factor when, but when you, you see a person, like a podcast allows you like, okay, I see like no, I'm not no perfect person. There's no perfect person, but I'm not a bad guy. I tried to be nice many as often as I can. It's like as many opportunities to be nice as possible. I try to take, but you're always going to get someone who doesn't like yet. There's always going to be people that are haters no matter what they look at you or the movement of hate toward you ever at all from anyone. Well that's sweet. Thank you. Thanks for now. I'm sure someone out there will prove me wrong, but now you're in the public and someone is always going to hate you, but not comics. I think we all like care about what comics think about us and jealousy and whatever. But yeah, uh,

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       people were like, yeah, for sure. I'm like, watch them again. You'd be surprised. Yeah. Yeah. Well I definitely got that like from the people that were like comedy purist or so, but it's also because I was always considered dirty and for a long time that was bad. Like, um, when I first started out there was a bad distinction that was being, oh, he's got it. He's a dirty comic. Like, Oh yeah, for sure. You were cheap and you were, um, you were going for cheap. Why would they say that? Well, because first of all it was Boston and it's kind of conservative a little bit socially and it was also that, you know, although the very edge, it was also fairly conservative socially. And it's also that they had just this movement and just sort of taking place where people had gotten the tonight show and then gotten famous.

Speaker 6:          01:47:34       It happened with teddy birds, Ron, it happened with Steven Wright in a big way and that they had gotten on these shows and gotten like this public attention from television. So everybody had a nice, had to have a nice television set. So the clean people got successful. Then you became, when you started thinking like, well that means they should get success. Clean equals like [inaudible] was good. Yeah, cleaning. It was good and dirty equals and I was so confused because I was like, well, the reason why I got into comedy is because I like, like Richard Pryor and I like Sam Kinison and like the guy goes, you know, look, you're not like this guy said to me once like, you're not dice clay. I go, no, but, but dice clay like became dice clay. Like he couldn't have been like really good when he first started with all these great form jokes, but he had a style that he enjoyed and like, I'm pursuing a style that I enjoy. But Boston was very suppressive of that. They did not. Yeah, no. Dot. Yeah, it must be way worse. I've always said it's way harder for a woman to do stand up, period. Because I think that, first of all, there's a lot of bigoted men that don't want to see a woman in a position of like the center of attention. Men don't like that shit. Yeah. And they want to be able to like stop you or a clown you or they'll have their egos. Well, I'll force them to say, sure,

Speaker 5:          01:48:44       I want to render you powerless. When it's why people attack it, they'll like say something about your physical appearance because that just takes away all your power or something. Yeah. But yeah, but also girls have way more of an opportunity because there is a shortage of really strong, um, working field. Like when a, when a festival comes up or like, who's a killer? Like, right. We will come out here and just own the room. Right. Which, which requires going on the road and doing the work for a long time, long time and uh, and, and, yeah. And a lot of people, it just doesn't get, get to there. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:49:17       Yeah. Like the arrogance that you know, like a lot of like young comics have like for a female comic it's a way more slippery slope. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:49:26       Yeah. It's really hard to give you a chance. What before you're ready girls.

Speaker 6:          01:49:30       Yeah, yeah, yeah and like the book rooms ahead of time.

Speaker 5:          01:49:35       Totally. Because I'm, because people, they want to have a woman in the lineup they want or whatever and that can, I mean just me getting on last comic that early like that. That was crazy, but it was like how many were you in before you got on last calmer to two years in all my God, where did you go on John Reape one wait, John wrote that was what year? What year was this? I really had fun. Went to was a really tough, I went to that the first, second, second was third and then on the first one, I'm sorry ma'am. I'm like, now I just, I'm a dick. I shot those stories or shows. It's really nice to see you have a moment of actual shame. I've never seen that. I liked the guy I liked damn fan. I liked that fan too. He's a nice guy.

Speaker 6:          01:50:32       Yeah. That was the, that was the first year that they did last comic standing when they realize that all these guys that were also in the show that made it were also being managed by the producer. But cats. Yeah. When everybody was like, wait a minute, what the people that, and then when you found out that you, the, the voting didn't really count that it was just sort of a ceremonial voting. It really didn't matter whether or not like that's why I drew Carey walked off and prep Butler Butler walked off. Yeah. Because they found out that their vote was not really about, hey, we're trying to make a show. We have the ultimate decision of who's going to be more entertaining and it just so happens that people going to that are more entertaining. I man and

Speaker 5:          01:51:13       yeah. Amy or surprising, a lot of paypal and the host and the host and the host time manage what? A cunt face. Oh God. What a fucking a parasite on the world of comedy. What do you mean? Who works with the agencies and management companies are great people. Most of them are awesome. Most of them are all driven by being proud of how they're living and inspiring their kid. You know it's good. I have the original pilot of that on VHS with Doug Stanhope Somebody's house. It's really hilarious. Someone else hosted after awhile, like Bill Bellamy, the host when I did it. Wow. What happened? Why? Why Jay Morris? Stop doing it. Trying to freshen it up a little. Is that what it was? Trying to make it a hundred hyper kids like black people [inaudible] black occasionally like those frowny ice cube type black people, but for the most part we'd like to keep them on the periphery. We bring them in. Bell me, it's not scary to me. I'll tell you why right now. Is he back? I feel like Bill Bellamy's back. I don't know Bill Bellamy. Yeah, I know he's on the road. I see like places where like friends. Yeah, different like jail. Yeah. That's the only way, you know, next week

Speaker 6:          01:52:38       say that. But like I love going like weird little clubs and especially because when I go I'll go with like, or Brian or

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       Dunkin or Joey, if you can go with friends. It's always fun. Like I've never had a bad time in the road. I can't remember the Youngstown, Ohio was not good the last time. Was that the one at the behind the dance club? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That place. Cleveland's Cleveland's true. Chicky because it's economically challenged. It's very much so, yeah. There's spots where you know, kids are growing up. We're just no fucking hope in their town. You know? Right now where he goes, he goes, here's a conversation you ever here? I'm going to Detroit. Okay. Have Fun. And he said, yeah, you just ate up as material premise for his next special. I'll go to Detroit. How Fun. Chad. He's so fucking funny.

Speaker 5:          01:53:46       He does Dallas. Oh, that's a classic. It's impossible to jerk off to that in 2013 that was funny. I don't remember. Are you picturing the carwash? James' old points really fun. First of all, Dave. So funny. Like off the cuff and heres a bunch erotic. He's got like sheets and sheets of material and he, he looked pretty watches the porn goes over stuff and like he really takes it super seriously on it. And then the accuracy, super respectful to talk about these films that they made that were iconic. Oh, he has them come back on with Debbie Dallas.

Speaker 5:          01:54:40       I did it with a Ginger Lynn. Oh Wow. Brian, no sex. She was on my first ever comedy album in 1999 she did a like a, an introduction to this song that I wrote. You just randomly placed together or I forget how I got in touch with her. I think, uh, I think I'd met her through Howard Stern. I think when I did a, the Howard stern show, I met her on that. Was it that or did it? It was the comedy store and that's how I met Jen. Jenna Jamison come, we'll walk them through a porn and make a wish. Say that again if you're calm while watching her porn and make a wish, what happens to everybody to get in touch with somebody? Is that how it works? Like a secret used a secret project. Amy, how do you attribute your hard work if you didn't use the secret? I mean, how did you attribute the success? Is that what it is? I think, I guess all the pain. I was funny as a kid though. Yeah, but then it was totally my defense mechanism. How will you

Speaker 7:          01:55:43       funny. All right. What do you like if someone says, how are you finding, what is it? Let's start. I used to just do, uh, uh, Eddie Murphy routines, pretended they were my own. Oh, my fourth grade. I'm like, I tell women to get out of the car and you can't do that anymore, these days to kick you out of the car. And my friends are like, that's not your experience at all. I'm like, no, it is. Draw. How's driving driving yesterday you guys weren't even around. Yeah. Then I was like, oh, I think I got a ice on this on my own. I used to tell my friends like Richard Pryor routines. Yeah. Sam Kinison routines. Oh yeah. I would like redoing them. Redoing, put your own spin on them? No, no, no. Say like the guy did it. I didn't try to pass them off as my own when I said like the guy, I don't figure that I might've once, oh no, I can't remember it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:27       Heating sand up you, you may like maybe the talent for it, that rhythm and whatever. Yeah. I sometimes um, uh, sat on Youtube where they're covering my jokes. They do that Amy Schumer stuff. Yeah. And My, I'm like, can you guys have them take that down? Like, and it'll be a girl like butchering it, you know, just like it's so embarrassing.

Speaker 7:          01:56:49       They should be able to do that. Be like cover bands in front of an audience. Yeah. Well man, see Ya. That was like his whole thing. Let me use essentially it was just really good at doing your shit. Do they say like, oh, in front of an audience? Not like in front of the camera. Yeah, no, it's in front of an audience. Or they say this an Amy Schumer joke. I like, no, they just do it and then they do it. But it'll say like, you know in the description like this is Amy. They don't say it while she's being interviewed and not like she's about to do all of Amy Schumer should. She just stole your shit. I'm like, can you at least be good at it? Can you kill with it? But she likes to use for like doing your shit in front of some strangers because the problem is if she doesn't say it and then they, that's a hundred people, whoever, how many it is, who don't know that that's your job. Right. And so if you ever go and do it, I saw those jobs. That's fucking man, that shit hole. You stole those from Mindy?

Speaker 5:          01:57:42       Yeah. Yeah. It's fucked up. Yeah. I was just like, I just asked my manager, can you get that taken off of Youtube? Maybe? No.

Speaker 7:          01:57:47       Do you remember your lawn? Gold? Yeah, I still, yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, when he first started, he does impressions of Comedians. He's a really good impression as, but he wouldn't watch them who would do a comedians, but he would do it with their material and that people like, hey man, stop fucking doing it.

Speaker 5:          01:58:03       Yeah, no, that's not okay. You have to be like this is it. Yeah. It was the wizard of Oz. We did you see the comedian? Yes. What? What? I was just going to say the same thing. Oh No, no, I didn't. What am I? God laughs Penn. There's a guy doing an impression of Louis. Oh my God. It's great. Fucking right. No, pull it up. Pull it up. Pull it. He's half black shell.

Speaker 7:          01:58:28       Half black is black. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Look at him. Leave his face. Oh, I'm really snarling. He's like, what have you. You're going to make a half black kid. That's what we going to do it. We can fuck that black chicken. I can see

Speaker 5:          01:58:39       guys will look like the hippest Brooklyn cobble pro. That's the kind of black Jack I want to go to. Like clubs where they play Brazilian music.

Speaker 6:          01:58:47       Putting it out there with the secret. You're going to get it already.

Speaker 5:          01:58:53       So funny. He does a commercial for his next special, it's really funny.

Speaker 6:          01:59:02       Okay, crank it.

Speaker 11:         01:59:03       He is a modern day. He is the most original artists. Since art was invented. I did write some more material on a coffee that most comedians right in their lifetime,

Speaker 7:          01:59:17       every hour

Speaker 11:         01:59:18       it's filmed his most daring special.

Speaker 7:          01:59:22       I don't know why the chicken cross the road. I know some sort of doctor. That's right. You Louis Ck is retelling all the greatest classic jokes in only how it looks like a fucking other chip. Huffington post declares even walks stupid. There's no, this is the inevitable backlash of the avalanche of success. Louis Ck is experience. I don't know. Maybe because six thinks that everything he does is the greatest in the world and nobody can tell him what to do. So he's all shelter on the wall. What club is that? Where is it?

Speaker 5:          02:00:33       Art makes Vishy look like a fucking hat comedian.

Speaker 6:          02:00:38       So what's the name of that place again? The laughing devil have often goes into Brooklyn. He's in New York. In Brooklyn? I think so. Oh No. Long Island. Silly. Where's that? Well, it's like Brooklyn or Queens. How many different clubs are there in New York now? In 2013. Eight. Eight in the city and the city. You know how fucking crazy that is? Stop and think about that. What other city in this God damn country has eight comedy clubs. La doesn't even have any comedy clubs. Maybe. What does La have? Let's let's look at la in La. The city, we got the laugh factory. We've got the comedy store. We got the Improv and then

Speaker 5:          02:01:16       man, when I heard it, we're

Speaker 6:          02:01:18       not pay money. Pay Money. That's not it. That's not a real common cause. That's a place where people who are scared of real comedy clubs go to cuddle. They should pay. I'll be on the record with that. They should pay. Should pay, pay Jesus Christ. Um, um, I've been there mixed nuts, places like that. Maybe

Speaker 7:          02:01:40       the, ha ha ha ha. Ice Ice House. Flappers so sex Connie Mack banks. We're going outside. No, we're outside putting governors of her though. Yeah, you're right.

What else are we now you're over that with them now. I'm sorry. Already traded. I would live in New York. You can we give you Joe Derosa? He's one of my best friends. I liked New York and I could live in New York, but only if I had a place upstate. Like I could live, I could live in New York. I know cross does that. He told me like 50 acres and acres. But uh, there's a lot of people will do it that way. They have a place up there where they can go on the weekend and you go and you see grass and you hear birds, you know, like a human.

Speaker 7:          02:02:34       There's a lake within a mile of your house, you know, that kind of shit. Yeah. That's a dope way to do it. Yeah. My manager has a place, I want to say what island, but he goes out there and goes fishing and such, so shut up, bitch, fucking ruin everything. He has his place on an island and he has to go there. Like there's no cars. He goes there that everyone rides bikes around and he goes there by ferry and then he has a house there that he goes to and this fucking nothing. It's just chirp. Chirp. Not really. Okay. Fire, fire island. Yes. He's on fire a little bit. He doesn't even have to be gay to go to firearms. I know. I've been there and it's a blast. I'm gonna say it. We'll have to be gay. I have to get out of here.

Speaker 7:          02:03:13       Get Out of here because I love you guys. Please let the function. Can I get a hug? Come over here because I want a hug. We're going to wrap this up with you. Ari and I will continue to talk for another five minutes about you while they're hugging. I'll just say that this Friday I'm at the empower bullshit fear with Joe Rogan and Bill Burrs, my farewell to Los Angeles. I love Ari Shaffir so much that I'm flying in for the show and then I'm taking the car to the Improv. Good and that hug. Yeah, somebody gift this, fill the beat. Is it up? Fill it up so much. You're a, did you hear about, uh, what happened on America's got talent? Hold on. Before you get into that, Amy Schumer inside Amy Schumer tonight, you fucks to night tonight at 10 30 Tuesday at 10 30 and 30. You know what that means? It means you're edgy.

Speaker 7:          02:04:03       No. Like she said, she, she, she was right after a new tosh. Edgy. That's good. That's a perfect spot. That's pretty bad ass. God Damn, that's an awesome spot for you. Congratulations. Thanks. We were supporting the fuck out of you. All right. Come back again. All right. Don't get too big for your Britches for us. Oh wait, I'm saying don't cause I don't mean to say that for a girl, a girl. You can't say that. A Guy, you can say you don't get too big for your britches and they, they're like, I got it. Yeah, that's it. Girl. Joe, did you hear what happened on a America's got talent or the guy that stole material? Great. Yeah, the Greg Wilson. Apparently he stole

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       a bit and it just so happens that the guy's bit was the a warm guy. Yeah. Yeah, it's the original game guy was frank. Nick tr zero. Yeah. And uh, I guess it's really ridiculous. Well, you know, apparently here's what bothered me more. I was talking to a boat show about it. Greg. I've never heard anything about that. Really. Joey Joe, he told me it doesn't really. Yeah. Uh, but the problem is when anybody does a bit like how about we all notice this and it's like, yeah, we have, right? So if some guy who's going to start calming seven years from now, he's also going to notice to think he thought of it too. Yeah. Something similar. What bothered me more was Freaknik Tero said, I've been doing this for 15 years and we're like, what? 15 years? Shoot yourself. Stop. So in that bit, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:05:28       What are you doing? Okay. No, thievery is never good, but what are you doing? He's going Catskill style. Not doing it every day. You know, like maybe he's been doing it for hopefully fun crowd warmup. But let's be honest, a lot of those guys that wind up with that kind of act, they do keep going like this. We know those guys that don't get like TV spots and not on comedy central that do the same act. Yeah, and they were like middle acts and they tour round like with the lesser roast. Yeah. It's just keep that going. Listen, when I went to go buy to think, right, like you could get a Mac, got your lifestyle. I'm still thinks she went and won't put his act on Hbo. You know that because then you lose your rank.

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       There's a lot of good jokes. He won't, he won't put it on a a special, he doesn't release any material and think about Jay Leno. Jay Leno has been a standup for a long time and my friend continues to stand up. He doesn't, my friends in San Francisco just saw him. He was just at a corporate event. What they think of him. They thought he was okay, but apparently some people said that he was a a little bit too risque, which is hilarious. I was like, what are you even saying? I don't even know what the fuck words just came out of your mouth. A little too risky, but he's doing the same shit. I mean, he can write jokes if he wants, but if you stop and think about the amount of people that have cds and like, like think about like what does that, I see just the guy saying, I saw frank do that muted fighting couple bit 15 years ago with the Ice House in Pasadena. It was his closer and it killed. Oh, that's what someone said when the guy was on TV. Yeah. Um, yeah, just the fuck on.

Speaker 4:          02:07:08       I would say that if television at all respect Stanhope, which at this point we all know they don't, they clearly don't. If they had all respect to stand up, they wouldn't pass the guy to the next round. That was the first reaction. I'm like, well, it was funny. We'll get into a patsy the next round. It's like, no, no way. They pass something. That controversy alone, she said, well, we can't take you until we have this worked out. Oh. But I thought they kicked him off the show. Then I think later that frank was so mad and then they kept talking about it. They're like, okay, let's just not, let's just not, well, I think they didn't know that it was stolen

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       until he was actually doing it. And then while he was doing it, the warm up guy came over to the producers and was talking to them and was in fee and it was thinking of interrupting it. Yeah. So for them to pass him or to say, well will pass you for now, like, like Howard stern was there too, right? Yeah. Uh, they would have had to just say, okay, we're going to overlook what we think may very well be the truth. We're just gonna overlook it because you did well. Well, if you say you've never heard, see, I don't know anything about the dude's act. The Greg when he calls himself the Greg Wilson. Yeah. I don't know anything about it. Sorry. I've literally never seen him. I didn't recognize him. I've never heard a word out of his mouth, but so I can't say. Yeah, so I haven't, but Joey told me that he heard the guy was a thief and that he cleaned up his act like immediate, been a thief at one point in time and clean up his act.

Speaker 6:          02:08:21       But that could be a bullshit rumor too. It's like if, if the guy doesn't have a reputation, if you're saying he doesn't and he's driving to La all the time, it is kind of possible that two guys could have a super similar premise and now going to say what both went down the same exact road and went to the same places. Maybe, but it wasn't watching it. It wasn't like what does it is exact version. His version and the ritual. Yeah, you do. Okay. You little bitch. Okay. So we're going to watch right now. This is the uh, supposedly original Frank Nikki Taro and this guy and a girl car fight. It's called. Yeah. So for 15 years, just think better be home like a Samurai sword. Every flight hit a car between a guy and a girl. Sit back. Enjoy. Okay. So he's doing his impression of where he sits on the stool for the folks on iTunes.

Speaker 12:         02:09:09       People on, usually like I can see some real, I'm starting off as the guy who's driving that. I'll become the girl. Did I make that clear? Do you guys need cliff notes with this shit? Are you saying you guys aren't Ucla? Come on, you're loyal and Mariana. Oh No, he did. I started off as the guy.

Speaker 6:          02:09:30       I don't get that shot.

Speaker 2:          02:09:36       Yeah,

Speaker 12:         02:09:36       he's a guy going, what? Oh, I get it. It's in the car. So you can't see. Right. That's the idea. So he's doing what? He's doing all this shit. It gives it a finger. He's going crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:09:51       Okay.

Speaker 12:         02:09:51       Now I could say he's doing, I haven't seen the other guys. Yeah, Greg's yet. They can't say this is easily something that anyone could think of. Oh, it's when you see a couple of getting into a fight and call. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. Well, it's just a bunch of like, this guy turns on the rate. This guy turns on the radio to ignore her. Yeah. And he keeps getting really, really upset by himself. It's really boring. He doesn't go for the ice on the ground right now. He's doing the girl and now he's like, I was giving me the finger. I didn't notice it the first time he had to push his finger. That's one thing. Or like girls do. They don't even know how to do it right. But it's basically a bunch of like mimicking that. You're upset. All right. All right. Now, have you seen this before? All right, so does he do any like particular cues? That would be something that

Speaker 4:          02:10:37       like, all right, he pulled out of that turning on the radio to drown her out, right? No, it's not in the second one. Okay, let's see. The other guys now. Well, I get it. I get what this guy said. There's no joke. He would cross and they both go to like, I think it might both go to like a beach. I at the end. Oh, willing maybe, but there's no crime. There's crime to get all the details. It was pretty boring.

Speaker 12:         02:11:01       He did this for 15 fucking union. All right. So now they're like still arguing back and forth. Okay. I've skipped ahead a little bit. It's basically for the folks listening to this. This is fucking Twitter trophy on the screen at the same time. No, no. Get them both done with. All right, so it looks like the girl and the guy do that. Someone would make us put screen. Imagine if like he exactly copies every movement. Every movement. That would be easier. Chateau. You could shadow over it and the guy's honking and people go around. I think, I don't know. He's leaning over it that Greg doesn't do. Okay. Come on. I can't do this. This is death.

Speaker 4:          02:11:48       Scroll to the very end and it showed the blowjob part. Yeah. Okay. It's coming. He says, come on. Come on. Whoa. What's that? Okay. Okay. Okay. God Damn. Oh, maybe it wasn't a coach up. Maybe just put his hand on her. He put her hand on

Speaker 2:          02:12:09       [inaudible].

Speaker 12:         02:12:15       Oh yeah. He acted like he acted like

Speaker 4:          02:12:19       put your head down to give a blow job. Jeremy Hall. Jeremy House. Oh, enjoy Jeremy. Oh, he was middling. Okay, so now here is Great Wilson's. They'll smash brothers must love this coverage. They got their sign in the back.

Speaker 12:         02:12:33       Twins.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       That's funny. Same thing. Exactly. Now he's actually be a little bit more animated. Greg's kind of wilder and then he's doing the girl. She's mocking him.

Speaker 12:         02:13:22       But here's the thing, if he did see that guy, do it, and then it doesn't matter if it's different. Yeah, he stole it. Yeah, but do you know, how do you

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       know this gets some e this could easily be something that someone else thought of. It's super possible. Like here's a perfect example. I remember when Tony Hinchcliffe the other day wrote that joke about how the pope got on Twitter. Yeah. It makes sense because the Twitter just turned seven. Yeah. Well turned out someone else has said that same joke.

Speaker 4:          02:13:50       I actually told him that. I was like, oh, I saw that. It goes from where it goes. I don't know. A while ago.

Speaker 6:          02:13:55       Yes, no, please tell me you didn't just, I'm like, yeah, I think so. He thought that someone else stole it from him, you know, and it was like this and meet. Well, you know, well we could say even though we know it's not true, but that is the same thing can be said for your wall bit with them and see a thing. This is something that a lot of people don't know about. This is kind of crazy crazy thing, but the wall bit with the Carlos Admin CF thing, when people said that, uh, well who would build the wall? Mexicans, that was like always joke with people don't realize is that when Ari came up with that bit, there wasn't even really a plan to build a wall where soccer is just starting to run. It was a joke, like Ari made a fake premise and then made a joke about a fake premise and then through the ridiculousness of real life, they actually did start proposing that we build a wall next to Mexico and that's when all these dudes start stealing it. But when our he did it, he was actually the line about, that's how I know that you came up with it first. No, no, they don't have that. Yes. So what's the problem? Really? What, who also thinks that we should get a wall of here, but then be like, oh, who would build it? It could be a way to go if not from me seeing him in the back laughing at my jokes. Well, not only that, he actually did mirror you. Exactly. He mirrored your motions, your hands, which was like your style. Like, oh

Speaker 4:          02:15:12       well this kind of looks like he's marrying the same, touching the leg first year at the very end of the jokes. He just went through the whole same shit and then he's doing the hands and then he was like looking over. Yeah. Oh, he just looked at, we didn't get that. He didn't do the blowjob part. No, he just looked over it. We did a hand light touch. All touched his leg. Yeah. Well, I mean what I'm saying, it's the same set up of the exact same ending with that. That was the punchline. I totally say. I totally said, okay, well you know I moved here. Frank and Nicole tear on. You're the only one you've seen doing this for 13 years. Fifth 15 I'm so, yeah, I caught the man short is is dead actually Greg stopped doing it I guess, but like it's, it must be tough to be like, what the fuck?

Speaker 4:          02:15:51       That's the all, I'm the only one who's ever done that. But it's like maybe not maybe other people, but if you find out about it and he was doing at first you kind of have to drop it. You kind of have to drop it. It's too, it's too close off. Freddy to this once about about, uh, about something he had and some young black comics. I do what I do that same joke. He goes, okay. He goes, I'm saying I do that same exact joke in front. He was like, well, enjoy it. Yeah, I'm doing it too, I hope. How does it work for you? Well Brendan Walsh and I had that situation where Brandon was, she worried that I stopped that he was steelo right?

Speaker 6:          02:16:20       And I said, no, it's, it's a fucking joke about a fleshlight. Like there's a lot of like obvious connections to like joking around license. And I told them, by the way, I'm, I'm done with it. That was on like my last special. Yeah. So it's like, it's over already. I already stopped doing it.

Speaker 4:          02:16:34       Yeah. Whatever she told me once, he was like, I have something that's real similar to what you're doing and I put it on, I was like, oh, let's stop. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          02:16:41       yeah. If, if you doing it now, and a guy had been doing it before, like I didn't want Brendan to stop doing it, but, uh, I wasn't going to get it done. It. Yeah. I would, I mean, I, I mean, I already read it rather, um, wasn't doing any more, not that it was going to stop doing it. I wasn't doing anymore, so it didn't matter to me, but I mean, it's on a special, you know, and I think honestly that he absolutely came up with it on his own because it's, it's, it's unnatural premise.

Speaker 4:          02:17:06       The best is working the booth. One night after that Chinese spy plane, the American spy plane went down, almost hit us Chinese spy plane. And what did they took our spy plane. Yeah. And, uh, I watched six comics that night make a joke about his name being long way. Yeah. Six comments. It's to the point where the audience is turning around. It's like, what's going on here? What is this a prank on us? Like, what's happening? But everyone is like, I saw the story and yeah. Well that was so obvious and then you realize, yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:17:35       yeah. Well I had that Obama joke like, uh, about change and I was like, oh brother always trying to get money out of my pocket or something like that. And yeah, I saw that. Like, I think he saw Joey Diaz do it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:17:45       Yeah. That's why I think you lose touch if you don't hang out at clubs at all. Cause you lose touch with what everybody's doing. Especially when it comes to current events.

Speaker 6:          02:17:53       If there's an issue, a big thing that happens automatically, people are going to try to, right.

Speaker 4:          02:17:58       Jeff Warren had a crocodile hunter joke about let's put them in a different situation with real people that are dangerous. You know, everyone had that. Well, I mean even dom Irrera had it fucking crocodile hunter job. Everybody did. I love with ains squeezed the testicles of this coca dial. Like everybody just accepts it to the Russian. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:18:17       Do you think that there's also clubs in Los Angeles that are on like the comics that hang out there plus they don't police each other as much as like say like the comedy store. Cause I know,

Speaker 6:          02:18:29       I'll tell you what, there was a situation at the laugh factory for a while. Yeah. Where it was like a den of thieves.

Speaker 3:          02:18:35       Well I heard that also about the Haha yeah, I've heard of

Speaker 4:          02:18:38       honestly I think that video you made Brian. Yeah. I think that video made comics that hadn't started yet who are now anywhere between seven years in and one year in which would likely the ones who start stealing. Yeah. And the ones that are around clubs all the time, those people are more likely to look out for it. Now. Those people are all the ones like, hey, I can't wait to catch somebody. So I think it's like it has put a serious dent in the problem. Things

Speaker 6:          02:19:01       that have happened since then. Like the patent Oswald one they've got out and you know there's been a few that have gotten out where people got and then just be those people are done man, they got tortured. It's over when you steal a joke today and this day, like there's a difference between um, similar premises and and parallel thinking and then someone who makes it. It's like obvious man. When a guy makes a career out of doing other people's shit every now

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       and then they try to do one of their own bits. When they tried to do one of their own bits, well fucking brutally obvious that they, the, the humor in these bits is impossible for them to have also come up with that other stuff. It's not, it's not the same mind. I saw a guy in San Diego do it once. One of the new guys there was like 10 years ago. Struggle, struggle, struggle, each promotion then crush on a bit about taking off a girl's Bra that I saw on the tonight show like like three, six months early or whatever it was. And I was, and then bomb bomb, bomb done. I was like, yeah man. Steely. I used to do this one bit about, uh, having an argument with an Arab guy about, uh, w whose country is more bad ass. That someone came up to him and said, you should be very careful.

Speaker 1:          02:20:13       You know, like it was so obvious that he wrote that bit cause it was so dumb and retarded and clunky and it was like so obvious that a person who had been stealing for so long like these I'll get hears. These are the ones you came up with on your own. It's amazing. You would think though he would have the format down. No. Would at least know the form of no, this is not, they're not studying it like a scholar. They just a burning shit repeating things. It's like, it's like watching directions on your gps. You don't have no idea how to get there. What's also, what happens is you don't learn the language. There's like a real subtle language of comedy. Like you know, language of music. Yeah. Well very similar because like comedy or like music, it has a rhythm to it and there's tension and release.

Speaker 1:          02:20:57       Yes. You can get away with the worst joke if you've made it like, oh, what's this going to go? Oh it's the pledge joke. Everyone laughs hard and you would think that someone who knows how to repeat that shit would also know how to create it, but it's not, it's not how it works because you also, the mentality that it takes to steel is the exact opposite mentality that it takes to sort of open up your mind and be creative to like to be like empty and creative. Like the mentality of a person who steals is very selfish. It's very me, me, me. It's very all about getting it done and you know, and getting successful and it has nothing to do with the art of it is you're not trying to be an artist at all. Whereas like to be creative you have to have an artist mentality.

Speaker 1:          02:21:35       You have to relax, you have to like let the ideas come to, you have to respect the ideas like the Steven Pressfield's book, the war of art is all about the muse. Like whether or not the muse is a real thing. It's like the concept of like, like abandoning yourself to the whim of imbues and working hard. They don't work hard and working hard. Uh, er got off stage the store and he was like, saw some new bit and he was like, Oh man, you just keep come up with new stuff. And he's like, yeah, I got stuck. I said, let's just come so easy for you. And it goes, oh no, make no mistake about it. This does not come easy for me. It's not an easy, but it's, but it is easy, you know, it's not easy and it is easy once you get a habit for him.

Speaker 1:          02:22:15       I think humans are just a form of force of habit. Yeah. I've been much more lately over the last couple months. It's kind of weird because I have actually have like last time, but been, I mean last time I busy. Oh, less time to do right now. Yeah. But I'm forcing it in. I'm making myself do it. Because you've got that problem on news radio, right? Oh yeah. During news radio when I first got on TV I fucking didn't do shit. And that was a big jump up. Listen owners. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I was tired all the time cause you were on a set, especially in the beginning it was radio. Eventually we got it down to her was where it was like we didn't even have to show up four days a week. Like sometimes we only did three day weeks. Sure. Yeah. We would get the schedule this.

Speaker 1:          02:22:51       Yeah, we would get the script in that we block it the next day and they would shoot it the next day. It was like three days. Yeah. It was easy. We knew and the writers really good and it was, you know, it got to a good point. But so what does it became? It was long, long fucking hours. I got lazy. Yeah. I uh, I just stopped doing standup and then I'm doing it. Well No, I did it, but I wasn't, I wasn't writing anything new. I was like going up with the same old shit over and over and over again for like two years. Like I didn't write anything new for like two years. It sounds, yeah, it was terrible. I mean I might have had like a bit here or there, but they were dog shit. I just wasn't focusing on Connie at all. I was working all day doing the show and then after it was over, if I did a set, it was like a maintenance set.

Speaker 1:          02:23:32       I would just go up on the weekend and just do like do bits that I had done. Just go through the motions. I wasn't good. I had lost my, uh, my spark and I'd lost the thing that actually got me to the dance and the first book, she got it back. I can see a lot of people never gotten that back. Yeah. Well that's what I told you. I saw Tim Allen once and 10 hour and hadn't done standup in a long time. And then he went on stage and it was like, it was like a famous guy. I've never done standup before. You would never believe that he was like this guy who like would dominate and girl stand up with dominance. Oh yeah. For the time. He was great. He was moved and the alleys punchlines and it was powerful stuff. He was really good at the time, you know, like he, like people wanted to go see that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:24:15       Like the reason why he got that show. Cause Yeah. People loved them. I mean, it was, it was fucking, it was fucking good man. I really remember him as a standup. It was good. It was good. People liked it. Cool. But he was not good. When I saw him. He was done. He was done. It was over. It was, it was a mass. He had done, you know, seven years of home improvement had been living this bel air mansion lifestyle and completely out of the loop of comedy and the grind and getting up there and that you lose that field. Would that do to you? Well, my set, um, I had one set that I fucking eight deck in front of the writers of Newsradio. Oh yeah. I had one of my friends, uh, my friend, uh, Josh Lieb, who was a writer and I'm a couple of other people that were there who I really respected. I liked them and they, they went up. So you know, it was really late to, there was no, there was no energy in the room, there was no energy. It was like, you know, I was getting on in the main room at like 1:00 AM ish and um, it was like at after don't ever invite people. We'll see. I didn't know. Oh I didn't know. I didn't know they wanted to come see me when you get to work. I'm going to be the comedy store when I am,

Speaker 6:          02:25:24       but it wasn't just the 1:00 AM cause I could do that same 1:00 AM set now and I would kill for whoever's there. I'd be fine cause I prepare. But I didn't know, first of all I hadn't been doing that much standup and I hadn't written anything new and I just wasn't smooth. I was just bad. It was awkward and I felt like Shit. And I remember leaving going, God damn it, I can't, I was really upset with myself because I've had some bombs before. But like I could sort of rationalize them like, oh I wasn't ready for that time. I wasn't doing, I was already a real legit headliner at that point. Like I could go on the road and kill for an hour, you know, it wasn't like as good as the stuff I'm doing now, but like some of my sex jokes and all that stuff, like some of the really old stuff like it would kill.

Speaker 6:          02:26:10       It was good. It was good stuff, you know? But I was just, I was completely out of sorts. I was saying the words without thinking about them. I realized that I had completely left my focus away from stand up and that embarrassment forced me to really gear up. So then I started like doubling and tripling up on my sats. I started writing again and then within, yeah, within two years I did my first album and it was, wait. Yeah, I was already way better. I had completely turned it around within two years. I totally, completely turned it around, but it was, um, one of those things where I realized like, Oh, I'm a lazy bitch. Like I lost my, the thing that got me to show business in the first place. It's amazing how few then whatever, whatever it does it spark you. If you then just push like I'm a comic and I'm going to write this.

Speaker 6:          02:26:56       Yeah. You're suddenly turn out this great stuff. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm a professional. Yeah. That's part of war heart. You just hired a professional to write your stuff for you. Yeah. This part of the war of art is being a pro and this is new book. It's called going pro. Going pro. Yeah. It's fucking great. It's really inspirational. It's bad attitude. Like I'm professional comic, like you know, uh, the other day before a show I did this show at the state theater and when a new Brunswick we'll probably the best set I've ever had in my life, one of them top 10 ever. So, um, um, before my set, I'm in my hotel room and I like had this attitude. I'm like, the next three hours I'm going to work on my shit. And I don't do that usually before I, no, before I show, it's like I did a show last night.

Speaker 6:          02:27:39       I don't know how to do it. I don't like sit down and go over all my shit. But I went over all my shit. I wrote on my laptop, I wrote on paper to, I wrote set lists out on paper and I wrote bits out on a lot and I worked for hours. I dropped Joey off at five o'clock we had an eight o'clock show and for two and a half, three hours. All I did was right. Wow. Yeah, it's amazing. And it was one of the best shows I've ever had. It was like my mind was like sparked by the time I got on stage, we were working it out already because I'm working, you know, you got to, there's a certain amount you can pull off. Just do it. Look, I come, I might have a great set right now. You could just give me a microphone and it's, if it's, if it's a crowd, my crowd, I can kind of get into a groove right now, but to have the best chance of that, you should really sit down and go over your shit.

Speaker 6:          02:28:25       And there was a couple of things that I said in the set that I had written down for the first time. That day you're going over your story and I turned to get a new angle and that new angle killed. There was a couple of new bits and I had new taglines or angles, not just fresh but insightful. Like I had hit a nerve like, oh, here's another, none of nerve a vein. When you're thinking on stage, if you're doing it through a bit, like here's point a, point B, point c, oh it's sparking something in my head and let's a super quick yes to put it in between C and D. I can get it. But when you're beforehand and your hotel room, we got some between c and d like, oh hold on. And you could take 40 seconds, two minutes to think it out.

Speaker 6:          02:29:02       And now it's like, oh, okay. That's the time I needed that I wouldn't have had on stage. You know, I like talking about bombing. Um, and I think it's, it's, I like talking about when I was a loser, I like talking about my failures in life. I like talking about being insecure because I've met so many fucking people that thank me for that, that thought that like, oh here's this guy's been on TV and he's a host for the UFC calm. Everything's groovy. But there's no, there's no groovy man. We're just people and it's a weird ride for everyone. Maybe blowjob joke used to suck a dick and I always, but sometimes it would alienate crowd. Yeah. They will get upset. Like what are you doing? Yeah. And then it worked. It worked it and worked it and it got to where it's just every time I needed to figure out a joke to make the biggest taboo ever funny child molestation, the most horrible non funny thing.

Speaker 6:          02:29:56       Well it's, and people would say, listen, trouble state is never funny. Actually. Turns out it's okay if the girl's hot and it's a boy. That's what Patrice said. But in the interview where they're like, have you ever seen her vape truck is funny? He goes get my last special, three of them is there's a way to work almost everything to the point where it's funny and sometimes it's an exercise just to try to get there. Yeah, just to see if you can do it. By the way, my specialist available right now. Boom son. That's how your market shit, it's called passive aggressive and you can get it@arishaffir.com right at the top of the page. And by the way, I have heard nothing. I would not lie to you and I would not bullshit, but I've heard nothing but compliments about that. So many people told me is your best shit ever.

Speaker 6:          02:30:40       And so so many people told me that they liked it even more than your last special, which they liked the album which we have right here, which is also available on Itunes, which is a revenge for the Holocaust. It's the evil Ari spider going to both have the same, actually it's going after a Hitler bug. Hitler flatter, leave him alone, leave him there alone. Revenge for the Holocaust, which was by the way, number one on iTunes bitches. Everything changed. Everything that changed everything. That was when they all woke up and they go, oh, this guy's for real. Like I started going to clubs more. I was like, I could just do this. They all realize that have a following, you know, one of the opening for you. It always like, Oh yeah, you're funny, but you know it's tough to Dow man. I told you like at one point in time I told you we were, we were talking about, I'm like, well you had, you were like trying to figure out whether or not you wanted to do this gig or you had something else come up.

Speaker 6:          02:31:37       I go, dude, people are coming to see you. Like you've got to realize they're coming to see you too. They, and they will eventually follow you somewhere there. There's not a lot of opportunities to get in front of a thousand people. You can get in front of a thousand feet especially, but then we were doing clubs, so it'd be over a weekend, the thousand people over the weekend. If you can get in front of a thousand people, you can make a thousand fans and then it thousand fans. How many of them going to remember your name? Well, if they're real fans of ours, they're going to be paying attention to this whole loop. So you enough. Don't remember. You don't remember you, they saw you. We started doing shows and then the real highlight of it wasn't Toronto, which uh, I have on my fucking phone somewhere, but I'm not going to find it.

Speaker 6:          02:32:15       I tried to find it the other day when you weren't here, when were talking about it in Chicago coming up. You went on stage Tripoli, Bro. Yeah, you went on stage and the fucking place went crazy. Toronto, Toronto Massey Hall, Dude, it's 3,400 people in there. And when you went on stage, they were cheering for like 30 solid second. Holy Shit. Well that was when you realize like, oh my God, they're my fans too. And then you were off to the races and then from there it's like all of a sudden your headline and all these places and you're selling out. And all these places and sometimes all it takes is like one tweet, boom. Let them know, let them know like that guy, you know he's here. Well that's the beautiful thing about my Twitter page. Yeah. And it's like, it's, it's like, uh, it's like, uh, a new distribution center.

Speaker 6:          02:33:05       It's like, Oh, Ari Shapiro, governor special out. You know, Joey Diaz is in Montclair, you know, Brian red bands in Sacramento. Like you can, you can use it and like you, you can just bump everybody up. Everybody just pushes, everybody gets pushed into mainstream and then everyone's got a career. Toronto's soak such a good mark. I'm going there the beginning of June. Toronto's amazing. I'm going outside Ontario. I'm going to Hamilton in London just cause I'm like this places that are two hours outside, let's go there to Toronto is the shit. That's one of my favorite cities ever. The people are, it's like a city with nice people. It doesn't even make sense. And I know there's some Douche bags in Toronto, New York with Nice people. Yeah. Nobody's angry. Well, I'm sure some people were looking to you, but it's like, it's a notice will be different tone than the average American gigantic city. Toronto is a cool city. Yeah. As is Chicago. Chicago is very much like that in America. I know Chicago gets a lot of murders, but I'll tell you, man, I fucking love Chicago people. Yeah. There's some fun people. They're like the nicest kind of people that you find a new drink so hard and they eat hard. Oh yeah. That's salary. Hat. [inaudible] Salad, sugar. It is sugar all over pizza for like, what does that, what do you it up? This is the best pizza

Speaker 3:          02:34:18       in Los Angeles isn't it's Chicago. Where's that? Montereau valley. California malicious though. The guys from Chicago, he's the one that always brings me to where to they ding Dong shows. Remember that guy? Have you ever ate that pizza? Where's the playground valid? I think it's like an hour away from Los Angeles, but just brings up pizzas for us all the time. But it's so good.

Speaker 6:          02:34:41       Do me a favor and put my Boston date on the Twitter page. You're going to Boston. Uh, I'm going in July. There's a UFC there. What are you doing? The, the um, Wilbur? Yeah. Well where the first show is already sold out. That's your hometown. Yeah. First show sold out, but I'm doing another one. Um, it's a, it's August 16th. Oh, it's August to him. They just added that. That's hilarious. It's already sold out and it's an August. That's your hometown? That's a homecoming. Yeah, man. Almost sold out in the first day. It's just when the tickets just went on sale the other day. I don't get to Boston and not for, it's one of the best places they were to perform. And I'm, maybe I'll fucking record my new shit. They're just the perfect time. Boston do it back home. You have two shows at a theater, a fight stuff, right?

Speaker 6:          02:35:26       No, it's all new. It's all new. It's 100% knew from my last special. It was not one to decide not to do it at comedy works. That's not a bad second. Yeah. It's not fun to come home situation. Well, it's also like the Wilbur's a weird theater cause it's a thousand people, but they're all like right in your face. It's like there's the bottom level of like a club chairs, tables and then it goes cedar and the balconies fairly low. There's still like right in your face, you know, so, uh, uh, if I decide to do it, I'll let you guys know if I decided to do it there. But you know, like for emotional reasons, it's probably a good place to do it because it's like, that is my, that's where I started started. I will always have a devotion to Boston comedy and the Boston comedy scene and you know, it's like that's, there was no place like that in the 80s there was no place in the world like that spot.

Speaker 6:          02:36:15       And you know, and so like that, it's not like that anymore. You know? I Know Austin has a scene and I know that San Francisco has a scene and there's scenes all over the country, but Boston doesn't have the same scene that he used to have. It used to have the US scene. It was the place. It was like, there was these media centers like New York and la where everybody aspired to go to. But then as far as like the place where that was just pumping out savages, you know, like, look at all the guys that came from that era. Anthony Clark, a lot of people don't respect. Now we're watching on TV and lucky he was fucking bad. Actually in the 80s. I'm telling you, Anthony used to kill Louis C K David Cross, Nick Depaulo teres put Teresa Neal, Bill Burr Dude. Stop and think about that. Um, uh, but mark Marin, um, yeah, dude, these are all Boston guys and Steven.

Speaker 6:          02:37:04       Right? But that was before Lenny Clarke. I mean, you can keep going on and on and on that one spot. That little shit. Shithole city pumped out a fuck load of comics. High level comics, man. Yeah. Greg Fitzsimmons. Oh yeah. Did I forget Greg? Dude, I did his podcast at cap city. They did a live one. Greg had one. Yeah. Uh, but I was there for Moontower. Anyway, so this is the, this is, it's Fitzsimmons, Janine Garafalo and Andy Kindler. Ooh, yeah. And me in the middle. I'm just looking at all of them at some point I'm like, what am I doing here? Yeah. Well Fitzsimmons in you makes sense. But he tend to, when I started Fitzsimmons is already like a made guy. Oh, you mean as far as like status wise. Yeah. So you're still trying to accept the fact that your religion at comic? Yeah, I guess so.

Speaker 6:          02:37:48       I guess that's what it this, while you're more legit than kindler. I love Kindler, but you're much more legit than kindler you. He can't sell out of club for a weekend. I guess it's just that when I shouldn't be mean about that. But you start and I say that. Yeah. But I say that because I don't think kindler gets the respect that he deserves. And I think also because Keller is kind of like the ultimate back of the room crowds. It's hilarious. It's very, very, very funny whisker off a low, like a political as fuck, but also really nice political as fuck. Yeah. She saw into that stuff. Yeah. It's kind of a silly game, right? It's fucking shows over folks. Yeah. We love you. You Love Ari? Yup. All right. You fucks. Um, party on prosper, Godspeed, all that. Um, I can tell you about all the podcast sponsors again, but I think you probably heard all this shit before.

Speaker 6:          02:38:39       I have a spot cast. Oh, he has a podcast called Ari Shaffir skeptic tank. Yeah. Tom Rhodes was on this week. He's not necessarily even skeptical about everything. That's just a good name. Yeah. Just me questioning. Just it is what it [inaudible] powerful road dog. Tom Rose. Sharon asked him, he said, where are you living now? He goes in there. Nice shoes, man. Wow. That's that. Go spot the spot. That's a legit fucking crazy person. Yeah. I couldn't do that. Yeah. Good. But I can't now. He met a girl and got married. He was like, if you want to do this, you've got to pair down. Whoa. Yeah. And she's down. She's with them. She said she goes with him everywhere on the road. Two, three. How's their whole life? Oh my God. And every weekend is a club or festival. Wow. That's a woman that's willing, willing to live your life.

Speaker 6:          02:39:22       Yeah. About her own life. But if that life is cool to see the world, hey, look at Doug and Bingo Shit works sometimes. Harlow, Sacramento, Ladies Gentlemen. Yeah. Brian red bands can be doing comedy Sacramento this weekend, Friday and Saturday, and then Sunday cops, um, along with Tony Hinchcliffe, the whole area's Sab, Tripoli. Hilarious. So it's a good time. Um, thank you for everything. Thanks for, thanks for all the Twitter messages. Tell your fans, man, thanks for all the love we loved them. Pump. Say, tell them, tell them we love to fans. You fuckers coming out in support and comedy and you're keeping it real. It's a mutual exchange. You help us be better at everything and we love you. All right. Go Fuck Yourself.
