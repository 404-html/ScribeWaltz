Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] live. We're back. I bet. Yeah. We came back. Well, Mons and Marquez Lmo Brian. Brian would connect. Correct? You were gonna we were trying to watch the fade or fight. We've got to get a new apple TV up in this bitch. We got this old shit. We gotta get the new one. The new one has a better remote. Oh yeah, I got the new one. I tried to download the road, use the remote APP, but he gets, it only works on one apple TV. Can't use it. The one you have somewhere else. It's not effective. What does marijuana, it's just bad for what does this, uh, we're going to watch the, uh, fade or Fabio Maldonado fight in its entirety. Entirety, Huh? Yeah. Is this fine? I believe it's 13 good. Hey, y'all give me, if you get panicky, fast forward. I've seen him. I know. Had He, did you see it?

Speaker 1:          00:55          I saw highlights of it. And you're in for a treat, but it might be more shocking if a guy like Kim took that much time off and came back and was as good as he's ever been. You know, it's almost like we expect from the greatest heavyweight of all time. What do you think is going on, do you think is the same thing that happened that came the same thing to happen to anybody at a certain time? Your body point gets older. Older man, like father time does not give a fuck if you're rushing. When he did throw down when he was stolen, no shots powers. The last thing to go Eddie, he throws him like, I don't know anybody throws those shelf. Fuck the way she's coming down and a spider. Can you see that? The power power. It's the last thing you you'll, that's why heavyweights last so long, but he could not got do it out there.

Speaker 1:          01:41          That's, that's strange. Who the fuck that? Let's get a big old spider appeared to get this white girl in corner. That was my idea or idea. That's still a Russian lady. Gaga right there. Well, what I wanted was a little cultural appropriation. Poisonous spiders. Eddie. That's a, you're lucky a Pepsi was seen in that bitch. That's right. It's just a black widow. What's his message man? Black widows eat their mates. It's just the like my pussy. So good. Who the fuck that off threaten you with? Uh, the fear of me killing you after I fuck you. That's how hot I am when my song, I mean, wait, who's this? I don't know. Say it fade or though the same fate or God, Russia's been some dark shit. Isn't that um, the uh, kickboxing gentlemen who knocked out Badr Hari is that it is Peter Grams. That Peter Graham never liked his kickboxing.

Speaker 1:          02:30          I'm sorry. Just check is still singing. This is so strange. I'd like to know if she can sing if fast forward this a Peter Graham with it. I think it is who? Powerful violins. Violins are very strong instrument. Chose it. You have class sophisticated. Yeah. How about the track team? Not Up in here. Track team. When you mean the Russian track teams banned from the Olympics. Oh, well, little cheat cheat. Well, getting a little testy. They said they're going to check other sports Russia too. They're going to be fucked. Something like Olympic Dude is tweeting at me saying that, uh, that I say that uh, steroids and I'm EPO aren't dangerous and unlock contrary to what I say steroids and danger. And he told her Olympic guy to suck Dick. Oh well can give gimme danger. All that stuff's dangerous. Use too much of it. If you read the line, all that shit I can for sure.

Speaker 1:          03:19          It could be doing anything and be dangerous. You know, it's fucking dangerous man. Cheeseburgers, Ibuprofen, really sending your blood like apparently that stuff, no, it's not even a thinning your blood, it causes all sorts of issues with your body. This a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medication that a lot of people take all the time. Well Cameron Hanes was on that shit. The dude was running the hundred miles right now. Yeah, he, he, he was on that shit. And then Rhonda Patrick came on the podcast. It was talking about how dangerous it is and all this stuff. It does. And he had been like, he's like, dude, I need it. I'm sore all the time. Check this out. He gets off of it and because he's off of it, apparently in talking to people that understand it, it, it affects your gut bacteria when you take too much of it. If you abuse it, he was taking 800 milligrams in the morning, 800 milligrams at night.

Speaker 1:          04:07          It's just too much. So it was raising, his blood pressure was doing all this shit to him and it was creating inflammation is gut because he was abusing it. It was fucking with his joints. So he gets off of it because of that podcast. All the pain that he's taking the fucking medication for in the first place goes away because the pain had been partially, at least because of the fact she's, he's creating inflammation by taking this shit. So is, I mean this guy was running so often, it didn't make any sense. I don't understand blood pressure. I don't understand what like why do you get high blood pressure? Why do you not? I don't understand it, but I do know that he gets off this Ibuprofen. He's doing the same thing in every other way and all of a sudden his blood pressure drops. Jesus. That's crazy. That's nuts.

Speaker 1:          04:50          So this guy who is, uh, doing the commentary for this thing apparently was the funniest fuck that man says he's the best. I was listening to one thing that he was saying. It was hilarious, man. I to, if they would let us listen and UFC you probably polar shit. Really? Yeah. It's five past. We got to get permission. They don't trust. He could talk your boy data permission. Too much. Dang Jar to be association. I didn't give you permission. Oh, maybe. Maybe something like this, right? Yeah. Fatal. It's five pounds. I should have asked it in advance. I don't want to bother him. She's got a lot of planning to do. How is it that the UFC 200 is still together? How is it that something catastrophic hasn't happened? I've cards too. God damn good. You just jinxed it. No, no, no, no, no. Not really.

Speaker 1:          05:33          If that card goes through though exactly as planned, it will be left to fall out. It's still the best, the best card of all time. Even if four fallout, we're still good, but what I'm thinking is villain. How weird would it be if nothing fell out like that's how crazy. This fucking sport is. Nuts. This sport is so wild and so volatile that you got to accept the fact we all do. Like when rumble just pulled out, Glover, we all accept the fact that man, there's like a certain, there's a certain amount of fights that just are not going to happen. Nothing he could do about it. Literally nothing. You do nothing. He was part of the sport, part of the sport. It's just too crazy. It's too crazy. It's too dangerous. Training suit. Tav trainings too bad on the joints in the neck and God, what did rumble pull out from that? This or does this? Jamie, this is your first fight of the nights. Jim Miller verse Tuck. Noreaga go me. This is fun. You Diego Sanchez and Joe Lowe's on Pam. Second fight of the night moves saucy and that's on fight pass pre cards. Have you seen Enrique Mart and fight or Marin? Excuse me. I have not. Enrique Marin and the guy was fighting sage Northcutt. I don't know him. Enjoy that sage enough north gut though. What do you mean by that? Meaning and sage north earthen rip your face off with his abs.

Speaker 1:          06:56          You're on UFC 200 for a reason because your names. Oh, you never know son. You never know. Sage northcutts there for a reason. Wow. Interesting a great card though. Dan. You didn't think that way about pass fight pass card they've ever had. God Damn Amazing Pass card ever. Right then. You will never do better than that. How about cats? Ghana and Julianna Pena. Holy Shit. That's going to be a wild fight, man. That main cards. Fucking nine Velasquez. Travis Browne, Josie Aldo, Frankie Edgar, Misha Tate, Amanda Nunez, Brock Lesnar, Mark Hunt, Daniel Carme, a Jon Jones. People are going to have a heart attack. Dana White. Nah, that's a hard tack card. By the time you get to the main event, you're dead. You know it's crazy. Joe, what? I'm going to say it without Brock Lesnar. Mark Hunt. That card's not that big of a bang or paper view wise. It doesn't beat a con card or Rhonda Card. Maybe that's why they come in.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Yeah. That's why they sent that bat signal. Brock Lesnar came over from WWE. Well, you know what? There's a reason why they pay that money. You don't. They did too. They played a very, very smart move strategically because he's the biggest paper. If you starve all time, numero uno, numero uno, that flat top good for him. So when Conor McGregor comes along and Conor McGregor in the UFC have some sort of a disagreement about things, would it be that is their fucking four aces that they lay down? Oh, did they pay for it? Yeah, there's definitely some pain, Yo. Yeah. Yeah. How much? How much? I don't know. Probably a lot. Right? Let's I what? From what I hear is the most the fighters ever been paid. How much do you think that is? Color makes more than 5 million. Ron Carter made a million. Apparently Kai was the first MMA athlete to ever enter into Forbes 30, 30.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Yeah, whatever the top third is, hot paid athletes top or whatever the hell he was and all of those. Number one. Yeah. And then there was, um, the other guy, what's the, uh, the, the soccer player Rinaldo's number one. Yeah, but there's the other guy, Massey. Yeah, he's up there Brazilian soccer player from like 10 years ago and all those guys finish that Brazilian a portrait. You remember that guy from like 10 years ago? The Brazilian guy superstar. Not that too. There's some bad ass soccer players these days. They make a lot of money, man. It's crazy. You know, we don't think about it because in the United States it sounded big sport because sport in the world, it's giant. Ronaldo and Messi. You're number one. And number two, Ian Edwards has been getting me into it. I've been trying. It's, it's, it's, it's fun. I mean, it's tough.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Strong. I stutter. Struggle's real. So here we, or just walked into the cage there. That's the top paid athletes in the world. Fucking good for you. Tiger Woods at fucking number 12 and you're making 46 million a year. Wow. Could you haven't done shit. He's on competing right now. Damn. Cam Newton, Lebron James' son, 77 fuck, fuck you Joe. Flacco. Joe Flacco. Fuck you. Holy Shit. Jesus Christ. Keep going down. God Damn. They're like fuck you. But he like, man, he makes more than Joe Flacco. This isn't these numbers or banana damn come Gary name. Yeah. Conor McGregor is like 34 or something. Go down there and see what it is. It's, he's at 22 million to more than nine years for for some reason there is no 34 whoa. It's a fucking lucky number. They kicked them out. Maybe there was a tie somewhere on the list. Probably. We're both guys are going to say a number at the top 50 he's up there.

Speaker 1:          10:42          There's no UFC fighter and the contras down in the 22 so it's, I guess it's a hundred is it a Forbes 100 is it four is 100,000 and a UFC fighters on there it is right there. There he is. 22 million. That's interesting. A lot of guys in this 20 to 20 he's number one and he's, what is that 85 in the world? All those sports. The call these people like Jimmy Johnson likes $22 million a year. Wow. Good for them. Canelo he makes more than Canelo and Canelo is now low. Such a base. See the biggest guy in boxing right now. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Right? Well they see the biggest guy in boxing a straw. No, he's dumb. Cause the biggest dragon has [inaudible] name another star. Really inbox right now. Now that Mayweather's gun. Well Amir Khan before that fight, but that, that was a big victory for Canelo.

Speaker 1:          11:30          Canelo still the bigger draw the right numbers wise. Miguel Kodo is still a big, Miguel Cotto was another example of a guy was like super tatted up and he's a world championship caliber fighter. Like that's a, that's a real rare back in the day. That's a real new, super tatted up, real, real tatted up and became more and more tatted up as his career went on. That's true. Do you ever see what I'm homeboy looks like? Um, the white dude from, uh, Youngstown, uh, oh, you're talking about Kelly Pavlik, Kelly Kelly attitude. He's just bodies covered a super tight, just went nutty with it. You know, who is the suit he's a young kid. Does is silly. It's skateboarding. He looks cut. Do you see what Bobby Green did? Tattooed his head? It's not like a dragon on his head. Well, okay. There it goes. Like guys can do it exactly the same.

Speaker 1:          12:17          He was right. He looks exactly the same. They both got dad bought. Um, they both got set of tits on him. It's interesting because they're in the neighborhood there. No, that's the neighborhood Joe. No matter if I came over dude's house and he looked like that and he had Bobby Green. There's this, any on his pants off and he has knuckles clenched up. I'd be very nervous to for the shoulders. It looks like those what a, yeah, there's Bobby Greens head look at Eddie fedoras never had an ass. Barbara Green tattooed his whole, what do we know what it is? I don't know. I don't know. Professor Athlete or bus. My man. You ain't working at remax. We're looking like that. It's good looking guy. He does shut the fuck. Don't hate, I'm not hating. I'm taking it on their out of it. Is it is the Dragon?

Speaker 1:          12:59          What is that German dude? I celebrate that Shit. No idea. I'm trying to figure it out. It looks like some sort of dragon. Yeah, something like that. It looks dope. Wish I could do that. Could not. Well, well what's his face? Uh, Jason Ellis has the craziest ones because it's so intense. It's so intense. Jason. I never seen Jason Ellis. She said I was tattooed a wolf on the top of his head. Let me see the Werewolf. Oh, his whole head is like a wolf. Look at liquid hook and he's white as fuck. There's a bunch of pictures of that Jamie, where he could see a straight on shot. We could see the actual wolf. That's a wolf dude. Look at that. Look at that. That's his head. So intense. It's so crazy. Looks good though. I love it. Only certain people can pull that off. He's, he did it.

Speaker 1:          13:52          He pulled it off. It's the same guy to me. Look at all these people like excited about watching his fate or fight. That might be the new shit. Shaved your head and tattoo it or build like his guys. Make it look like Karen me tattoo that fade to fe. Tattooed. Imagine you have to have a good design though. You can't have like hello kitty hair designed. It doesn't go out of style. You can't tattoo a mullet. What if you have a whole menu of what's going on in there? What does that, is that, is that a bad ea or a boozer? Carlos Buhler. Boozer is that real? He tattooed his whole head like spray. No, he went ahead and spray paint that shit. Oh Wow. I don't weird. He looks fucking terrible. I hope that that catches on and that'd be cool. I've seen some really bizarre head pieces that have been done like people have a over the last few years that's been more and more common and do like these really crazy art pieces on your head.

Speaker 1:          14:51          Is it easier for black hair? Bobby Green. Excuse me sir. Don't fuck. Look at this. We're watching fader and Maldonado and fader was just swinging for the fences. Man, look at this holy and and I was covering up in Malden dollars, moving, standing right in front of them and fade or just blew a giant wad and Maldonado duct and covered and blocked. A lot of that will fade or definitely unloaded on him so much. Knock out 39 impersonator looked like this fade or just swing and man, this is crazy. Maldonado's blocking. A lot of that stuff comes down the street. This drug, this all time. Look at their bodies. It's still there is he has to make sure you eat ice cream and I checked your blood. There's no ice cream.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Real life. Everyone's eat the hot dogs all day. All Denado is bleed. No left. Oh, there it is. He's, he's out. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. He is. They're stopping this. The sparks flying there, man. That's amazing. He's a baptist stuff. Oh my God. Dude. I'm like legs and both time, but God damn it. You have, the brain can only take so much. The head can only take so much. I do it. What are you doing, man? What do you mean into the clothes? What are you going to do with the UFC if his life outside of this is probably not as fun if you're best friends, fucking Putin. Putin likes to see victory Puente, his best buddy. Deep and Russian girls is a good time. I don't know. I shot vodka mock Russia, Russia. This is a beat down, man. It's an ugly Pete down.

Speaker 2:          17:57          Oh,

Speaker 1:          17:59          how bad. He's still fucking still getting bobbin that head moving. He must be so determined not to lose like this again. Look, the dropped again. The emperor is a fucking monster. Boy. He has taken some horrible shots. The Russian Zombie. You're fucking batshit crazy. You think that Russian judge or ref is stopping anything? He didn't want to die. If you're a journalist, you write bad shit about fader or you die. This is so, uh, it's so weird to watch him like this now and think about when he was in his prime. Oh my God. Well you to bump this up. You know what their day just fucking gave that ref. Oh my God. A new car. You know what I mean? The mob. It's funny in this show. Oh Jesus Christ. Leave this.

Speaker 2:          18:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:45          Oh my God. Maldonado, that nasty apricots modem box to me. Fuck Aa can only hurt Glover. Yeah. And they got dealt with. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. He's uppercuts. What did they do at rough? Said let's put this up. Let's give him a break. What did he do there? Got Him another car. Oh my God. Oh, upper cut. Another one. Another one. Fatal. Tried to crazy knee fader swings back. Look at them and saw Austin. We're strictly cause he going to go three rounds. This is incredible and amazing. The power fade or possesses and has flied in us. Have you ever seen such a powerful flat ass? That's a very good point. Right? So I'm just going on as a tiny ass. Most guys that much power. I have fucking cheek son because look at how, why to shoulders are, yeah, I know no ass. That's where all your power comes from.

Speaker 1:          19:41          Well you know the thing is you don't need that much power. You just need to land with power. Right? Like the difference between the guy who's got like stupid one punch knockout path Johnson. Yeah. And it got close to be as though cheeks but Faye doors knocked like um, what's his face? The grim reaper. Fuck's his name. Grim reaper do. Um, in, uh, give me a hint in strike force talking about Brett Rogers Rodgers, right, exactly. He didn't call himself the grim reaper. I don't think so. Did he, did he breadth the grim reaper Rogers. That's, that's a nice ring to make that up. No, that has a nice ring. Somebody call him that he did it and I hope it comes back and fights. Is that, has that name? No, I made it up. What's that? The grim. Okay. I'm sorry Doug Graham. But he thought, oh my God, look at this phase.

Speaker 1:          20:37          Brandon, I think, I think it's just the shorts for Bikini's on you would see a little bubble. But remember Brett Rodgers knocked out Andrea Lawsky and the first round and he was really good and I think he fought fade or after that if I'm correct. That's right. He thought he'd beat Andre. And then it was a big high profile fight, but it was a tough fight for Fado before he bombed on him with a right hand. And there was an interesting fight because one of his trainers just like fate or one with his old tricks, but really like you need to be training and there, remember Brett Rogers Fret over him. He fought Uber. Uber even fucking thrown to the mat. Ubering was terrifying back then and said, hey, Brett Rogers, sweet knock out of our Lawsky here's feed or Uber, Rheem. Enjoy this. You're going to go away now. You know what?

Speaker 1:          21:20          I don't enjoy an MMA. That overhead shot. Oh, the right hands. Oh, Maldon Nanos got a nice short right hand. Who can that Jab fitters thinking right now? God Damn it. Wow. Maldonado way looked at like double jab fate to the face and a jab to the body. Nice and loose. He's a good boxer, man. Yeah, really good box. Ooh, barely clipped. Fade on the out. Faders faces a mass too, man. He's such a warrior. Can rush it out and be okay that he tries to find neon him. God Damn, he's a savage man. Shows you how far the sport's come though. When I watch this stuff, my God damn. It's nuts. Like watching Wonderboy is nuts, man. Oh, it's a different thing, but it's also a different weight class as well. There's never been anybody in this weight class that can move like wonder boy damn magic and his ass. Oh my God. Fit or the come back strong. They're both exhausted. You have a fader was the Atlanta in some good shots there. Ooh, nice length fillers. Fucking them up. Well, here's a diversity of fair doors attack versus Maldon Donald's boxing fader control. So it's just been a box too though. Yeah. Oh Hey. Did you just use not that bad. He's, he's good at getting back up mirror. Mild. No. You of the body all the time in the UFC. Is he a brown belt Eddie? I don't know what it is.

Speaker 1:          22:45          Why don't I feel like he's a brown belt? Fabio Maldonado Jujitsu. Find out what it is. He, Oh shit. Now I can't see fit or I can do everything man. You know. And this is the NASA space. He against heavy bag though. He's exhausted. He is. But I mean fader was really good at, look at his adjustment. He's decided to fight on the outside, start kicking now. And then these found the weakness in Maldonado, his range, he's fighting way farther apart now. Look at him cause he got ate up by some of those punches and so you got such a good job. Oh beautiful. So was coming in with these punches, but he's on the outside with those kicks. See I think this distance he changed the whole distance game. I think anyone in the top 10 would eat his fight. Maybe now. But God damn it, I'm watching.

Speaker 1:          23:28          This shit almost makes me upset. That's what I'm saying. I lied or man, no, I'm not saying that pride in the UFC didn't come to some sort of an agreement early, early, early on and we could've seen fade or like cro cop fade or add his best fight against the best heavyweights and he mean very well. May have been the best for quite a few years. Most likely was most likely, most likely. I mean, it's all, it's all speculative and totally actually fights a guy like Cain. But God damn, he was good. Maldonado was a brown belt boom. Beautiful fucking combination for memory. Harmful. Ooh, look that right. Jesus Christ. He looks good. I'm talking about those really guys blue, but the k doors, he's, he's landing some colorful show shit. You, you, you sympathize with him because he beat bay doors ass and he got tired from it.

Speaker 1:          24:24          Nothing. They don't got the ass kicking. Yeah. You know what I mean? No. He's one on the other side of the punishment. I got feed or um, I mean he's hitting on some really good shots towards the end of this round. I think it's his round. 100% of them are small punch this round. No. Yes, he did in the beginning. Very beginning. He hit him with good shots, but Fado has definitely taken over this round or set 100% of first round. He lost 10, eight. I don't give a fuck you from Russia. Egypt. That's 10 me. It might be 10, seven man. It might be 10 cigs if we're in fucking Colorado. Yeah. That's weird. It's weird. Decide what that is because that was the Brits attentive. That was a vicious beat down in this round is a perfect example. This is not the beat down that that first round was, it's he's who could this Maldonaldo clipped him. Draw modern. I don't fucking clipped him again. I look at Fader, his face, man. It's a horror mask. Oh. Oh. Oh my God. God Damn. The faders brothers in prison. Right. Um, I think that's what I read last time. I too. It's like Marlo Zimmer main new sites. How to think about it and then interviewed them there. Kill them bitches or something. He killed anybody in the snow. I think you're making sure that, I don't know what the fuck happened. Even little snow, but he's a savage. He's a super selfish blue. That ACL.

Speaker 1:          25:44          This is one of the commentary was at its best. I don't know what is going on. What he fell down, bitch. She's showcase trying to create drama when there is nothing ice. He's fat. Fucking five minutes and 50 seconds. How about you shut that off. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          26:02          Yeah man.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Well fight. So fader won that round, but that's a ten nine rounds. The last round was ten eight hundred percent I agree 100% even though he got knocked down. He still one? Yeah. Yeah. I think you want, I mean he, he got clipped any went down, but he went right back up and I think mother Russia, he landed some pretty significant shots. It was a close round, but I think I gave it to fade or, but I'm not a judge and I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Did anything terrible at scoring things.

Speaker 2:          26:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:34          I don't think Tufts sports score, I don't think in some cases there should be a winner. You know, like the boss of your fight both say, yeah, I feel good. That's like that. Like to say one guy, one on one guy lost my God. Damn, that's so close. It's so close. He gets into this gray or, I mean, you could say that you thought that Bossi one. And I could say that I thought I'd call and why, but if you, if you, if you look at it all together, it's like, man, it's just a, it's a guess. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's a great guy. Damn fight. It's so good to see. You need to watch it again when I'm sober. Yeah. I need to watch the whole fight. I usually do that. I record them. I watch them Sunday mornings when we do the companions.

Speaker 1:          27:14          So this is a third brown. So I have ten first round for Fabio Hook. Your favorite? Favorite. Wow. Fay door's busted. Hot Man. The greatest of all time. Right? What do I still does it? The only other guy that it's on the argument about the greatest of all time. Times cane. Oh, how dare you. What about for doom? Well, Pete Kane. Yeah, that's true. That's true. What about Steepbank? Yeah. You know what? Steep Steep Bay has the potential for sure. He's like at the door, you know Steepbank and hit together. So do before you can see as the greatest phone. No, no, no, no, no doubt. But he's, he's in an advanced place, right? Knocked out for doom and a beautiful one. Punch knockout in Brizzy wobbled him left with a beautiful left hook. God damn his boxing is crisp. I'd say Malo. Strikings better this fight. It looks good man. It does. It looks more Chris. Well, he also knows this is super dangerous opponent.

Speaker 2:          28:14          Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          28:17          Oh Nice. Your body by freight door. Still quick as fuck. Oh Man. Combo. Beautiful Combo by fate or really isn't dropped. Oh God. Mom and clipped him again with the left. Hook them up. That left hook on the outside. Oh, the jab. God damn all done. Otherwise are good fucking striker.

Speaker 1:          28:43          You know, it's, it's one of those things where you gotta wonder like, is this what fate or wants to do? Is this like an exciting fight for Ramsey and join this or is this a, is it a financial decision? You feel like it's diminishing his legacy? No, not to me. To me it's just this is who he is. This is not what he's done. Just a fighter. What he's done is just fucking, you can't take that away from them. Yeah. I mean if you go always be PAMF pound one or two for me. Heavyweight. Oh yeah. I think one, I think one, yeah. For me as a case. He does have a case, but the thing is, I don't know, a fader was the same guy by the time he got divert doom. I mean it's total speculation. I also think, you know, guys taught long and errors, man.

Speaker 1:          29:24          I agree. Because you look at what Kane did, amber doom, they're also facing I think more well rounded guys. Yeah. Good shot to the bottom. Evolution of the sport. 100%. But you know, when you're looking at all time greats, don't you think that Muhammad Ali is the greatest boxer of all time? Do for bevy ways, ins, right? But if you yeah, like for socially. Yes. Yeah. And what he stood for over pop culture, all that. What do you think that he would have survived? Mike Tyson, the Mike Tyson. The beat Marvis Frasier. Yeah, I do. Maybe, but did you ever watch Henry Cooper knock them down? Yeah, they're like the same age when Henry Cooper knocked, uh, Tyson down, or excuse me, Muhammad Ali down and um, uh, we're talking, we're talking Muhammad Ali before the draft bullshit. Yeah. Oh yeah. This is death. This was when he was Cassius clay. When he sketched clay, he beats Mike Tyson afterwards where it's tough.

Speaker 1:          30:13          Yeah. It's hard to say man. Yeah. That's a thing, right? It's like when do you catch the guy? Like when you look at this fade or you can't judge this fade or in the third round of this fight with Fabio Maldonado who's been beaten up, his eyes are almost won. This is not quite the same guy as the guy who we saw just armbar. Kevin Randleman have to get super relaxed. The guy that we saw come back against Fujita Fujita caught him on the big punch, came back. There was no Garrett grounding pal. Yeah man. It was no camera. That's what the time, cause remember Verdomme fought in pride and he would have eight fucking ver dooms lunch back then but for doom now with list his fucking head off. I think there are different guidance to say for doom now is on the, he's still at the very highest level.

Speaker 1:          31:04          I mean we've got to see how he rebalanced for Steve Bay knock out cause it was a brutal knockout. But before that fight, if you look at his knock out and Mark Hunt and if you look at a submission victory over a cane, you're looking at like the best version. You think about junior dos Santos in his prime against fade or fight junior dos Santos is prime in his prime. His father came stuff. But I'll tell you what dude, he looked really fucking good and his last one great. He did look really good. You look great. Shocking, right? Amazing. Really good. Amazing. I mean a lot of people thought that Ben Rothwell had the answer to his uh, boxing style with his, you know, Ben is just awkwardness. Real awkward and dangerous. Like super dangerous was knockout power dealt with and also like really confident. You know, Ben is just a real savage and super experienced guys.

Speaker 1:          31:53          Been around for a long time. Huge, huge, enormous, like one of the biggest like physically Busiek biggest guys in the heavyweight division. Like just how busy we are, how big he was. And even at Wayne's I was like, he's not that big. They want to get knocked down like Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I doing it heavyweight. He's so big. Enormous. And Harry, he's so big that he did. He like, there's no doubt he could not make two oh five you look at me go wide. These are real heavyweight fights. I like to be lost a row or like, Hey, what do you think your two of five? No Man, what do you think of 300 yeah, he's the argument for the weight class. Yes, it's got his hands down. Boom, boom. He's exhausted. I think man. But he a lot of times he fought like that.

Speaker 1:          32:36          He never moved like that, but he's just a, you know, I mean you got to consider the beating that he took in that first round, but if you remember like the cro cop that used to, there it is. That's the end. That's it. Yeah. I first round ten nine six [inaudible] 10 I mean first round, ten eight second around ten nine this friend, I don't fuck, he won this round two seems like a draw. I would, I would assume that it's draw. If I was a, if I didn't know the score, he jumped up on the ring like he for sure had it. Well, you know he fought well. I know in that first round he did second 30 days. Hill faded would be undecided in a couple of shots in there. We'll fade or definitely came back in that second and his reign draw his range was better.

Speaker 1:          33:18          Yeah, I would say that that's a reasonable to call that a draw. If I was watching this and I was objective, there's never good Madoff in the house either. Draw them all Dinaro line either at the draw. I'm all denial. Yeah, I don't see, yeah, I agree. And the damage, well there's no way that fate or the second or the third by any more than ten nine if you had the standard scoring system, we're getting dropped. Last hook he grabbed, he cracked him, he cracked. Even in these rounds, he's still hurt, fade or more than feed or hurt him or hit him or fate or it hit him with some good shots. Those second and third rounds, but he wobbled, fade are in the second round riding on the shoulder a lot too. He's, yeah. Well there was a nice ride, man. Look, it's a good fight, you know, and Maldonado rose to the occasion and for photo, this is a very, very, very difficult fight to gypsy.

Speaker 1:          34:05          When fader would make paintings and they would sell them on Ebay. Yeah. Beautiful. Through a terrible, people would buy a beautiful paintings. I even looked at bidding and on one, did you go to college? I was like, yeah, I want to fade or painting. It was like a smiley face man. He's um, he's all time legend right there. If your fate or I can just do shit. I almost bought it. It was take my fucking paypal. He's 39 now. So how old he is. Yeah. 39 30 he needs to stop all time. Legend man. All Time Ledge. And how old is Dan Henderson? Dan Henderson is 45 and the goddamn American treasure just knocked out. Hector lie the way to find it for a world title, by the way. Knocked out. Fade or don't forget that. That's fucking Strikeforce. Feta. Does that hook? He misses any comes back with the elbow.

Speaker 1:          34:54          Oh yeah. That was some shit. You can't even put it in a movie. You can't put that movie. He would go shut up. And why is he moved so stiff movie. He would be like, I don't believe that this guy get hit that hard. Look how he moves. These are [inaudible] paintings. Look at this and it. He's Shitty game up now that he retired. He's a little more detailed. I didn't look up there. Nah, I don't want that. Fucking beautiful. That's a beautiful tweety bird. Cute little girl. No, he got away. He works with, I didn't want these. These are two good. Let me tell you something man. We, we all know he's drawn this shit. That sad. No, cause it looks like his face. That's crazy. Listen man, we all miss something in our world by Brock Lesnar and fade or never fighting. I agree. We all miss something 100%. We miss a little piece of life.

Speaker 1:          35:40          Two Lane that could have been too late. That could have been really interesting. It's still happen. It could definitely still happen. Immediate fate or just won this fight. And if Brock wins his fight, which is certainly a bigF , and if the UFC decides to sign fade or after this fight, because to the fans, like this is a really tough fight, buddy. One, it's still not a loss. You know, after you wait a few months, I'm just saying if I was a salesman, which check kind of, that's your thing as what I would say. I would say, let's fucking do this. We've always wanted to see this. Let's do this. By the way, give him a fucking Usada exemption that playing games, any games, give him some turbulence. You let them take whatever he wants. He's fighting Brock Lesnar. Oof. Let them take whatever he wants. Let him get some of that fabric in the report as the north miss a big reporter, James Bro. It's like, why don't you get smaller? Hmm. I'd like to see him a fate or go out. He'd go out and after that, yeah, he's his dad. Giant ass gorilla.

Speaker 1:          36:47          Who's that guy? Look at his hands. Jesus. There are enormous, you don't want that. That could be Andrew Karalyn remember that gets definitely not though. Drug corral looks like way harder. He's like, he's terrifying looking. Cool Mike. I don't about that. Pepsi money. No, I don't know what the fuck is that. See my ultimate ad space. He was on the mic fucking like a fader. Well the UFC has like a unit. We have like a little UFC logo. That's the show and like a network guy. But when you have, what if the UFC had a monster low? Uh, Mike, can you imagine? But when I do, he said he was for Fox. If it's fs one, it says it on the, it says Fox on the little thing. But like a sponsor, like what do you think that is? Is that a station? What is that on his mind? I think that's Russian. Pepsi. Look at that.

Speaker 1:          37:41          It's got to be wow. Or, or they, they just like the same colors. Brendan Shop. If you were afraid or his friend, would you tell him right now? I would give him a way harsher talk. Then he gave me, I would fucking the hey man, cause I'm sure he has the options in Russia. He's a living legend. He's like Brad Pitt and Russia. You know what I'm saying? Did you know that there's like someone was saying something crazy, someone sent something to me on Twitter about him fighting value of next. That's seven foot tall Russian boxer. Is that bullshit? I mean if you take some down. Sure. Jamie, see she's crazy. Bullshit. Fucking circus. I Dunno. Well fighting giant giant dudes. They don't know shit in Vegas. He remembered he did that twice. He fought Zulu, who was a huge guy but really charming. But then he fought Hong Whan Choi who was at like a seven foot one guy. He was enormous, right? Yeah. This dude at the Mirage

Speaker 3:          38:36          talk me. I don't think you would sell tickets. Three food at night for Friday. Saturday, Sunday. We do a live flight companion from that bullshit. I want to be this shit be alive,

Speaker 1:          38:51          get paid. If we ever get hired by a casino to do a fight companion in like a large space and Tiwi enough for now. Oh my God, we're going to get shrunk. Someone's going to kill us for a crazy. What was I asking you? This research I caught value of, I don't know whether or not fade or is rumored to be fighting value of next because someone was saying that on Twitter. Can you believe he's going to fight value of, and I was like, why? I think it was Twitter. Read it somewhere where I read it. He just needs to stop. Well maybe it doesn't need to stop or does he need to do whatever the fuck he wants to do and this is loves doing the fuck he wants to do. This is probably like more fun for him. That did not look, they're not telling you, but came back strong as fuck in that second round.

Speaker 1:          39:40          This is the first real, it was the first real challenge that he's had. The first guy just could not grapple with them. Right. Take that guy down. Dominates and when the ground ground and pounds on this fight, he gets tested. So what he's got to do now for shampoos, take some fucking time off. Take a long time. Off. I think we've taken enough time off. You've got to heal up and get your ass back. You don't get that much time. But that's not what, I'm 39 I agree with you 100% but I think he's got to take some time off from that beating. He took a beating dude. You can't just jump right back in. You'll be, you'll still be suffering. Remember, remember what Steve Bay did? Maldona yeah I do. I do. I do. Steve Bay is a monster. You starched and congratulated him in the ring after this oh value of did and that's about, that's it about a fight.

Speaker 1:          40:23          But there was some weird thing where they cut the value of any made a face cause a fader was making some sort of a speech and they cut the value of, I'm just speaking out of like a, you know, bullshit rubric. Well also like if I had to be skeptical, I would say probably what they do. Which Putin there, that's what it says. It says my knees. A notable people came to congratulate him including Nicholi value. Evan notably Vladimir Putin. Putin and him are, or boys. Are you scared if Hillary Clinton wins? Oh Shit. And I'm more scared if Donald Trump wins more scared. Yeah. I think he's

Speaker 3:          40:59          either way. You know what? This is what I think Hillary Clinton a million percent and is going to win 100% of them. Donald Trump is not going to, they're not going to let him be president. That was just a big distraction. They put them in there to make sure Hillary wins. For sure. Trump going to be president. Well that he's going to be the president. It's all you think is a sound sensor. Tower seven. What do you think you'd think, uh, you think that the election was rigged with Bernie Sanders in California and Hillary, you think it was rigged? You look into it at all. He didn't into it. I did not

Speaker 1:          41:34          think it was rigged. Um, there's definitely some sort of a problem with there was votes at weren't counted, right? Yeah. Pretty much. That's right. History and really being in the Bernie Carlson pull more land to, hold on. Eddie, what? So yeah.

Speaker 4:          41:47          A friend of mine who I follow on Facebook. Uh, he was really big in the Bernie campaign, uh, falling a lot of it, uh, posting things all throughout the last couple of months. He was even making posters that were going viral online for it, helping voters for registrations and whatnot. His vote wasn't counted and it said, because he didn't sign this thing and he is adamant that he hundred percent followed everything to the t double checked all this stuff they're telling you is, but it won't be counted a hundred.

Speaker 1:          42:14          And so what is, um, so what's the conspiracy conspiracy theory? Is that uh, um, that Hillary's campaign is actively suppressing votes? Is it that or is it that there's a bunch of people that are zealous and they, uh, they identify with the Hillary Party and they work some in some way, shape or form and counting side. It doesn't count. That's what that means. Everyone don't have to be, oh, I voted if you didn't vote, don't fucking complain. Guess what? Your phone didn't count. Right? No, I totally get that. But I'm saying like, what do you think is the mechanism? Like what's actually happening here? Is it because they think that Hillary's parlor, so Hillary, it's like there's some sort of concerted effort to make her win even though they know she wasn't wearing. She's part of the team and she's what she's can apply no matter what you're selling, no matter what.

Speaker 1:          43:07          Here's the question. Here's a real question. Who's doing that and how is that, how is it the people that are working in the campaign offices and in the election was the government? Well, the people that are working in election offices, the people that count elections, right? They count results. They must have some kind of political bias, right? They must meet people do. Everyone does. Some people are just naturally democratic. Some people are naturally conservative. They'd have to. How do they account for that? When it comes to something like this, like when you have, what is the excuse, like what's the, what is the, the the reason they're saying why these votes weren't counted.

Speaker 4:          43:44          Provisional ballots is something I've heard come up a lot and they're going to be counted over an extended period of time. But they've already made calls for things. So that, I don't know how that felt,

Speaker 1:          43:52          but the dude, you know, said that his stuff wasn't signed right. They said he wasn't signed. Did you take a photo of it?

Speaker 4:          43:58          Screenshot. I sought, I think that you said he's got even eye witnesses that saw him.

Speaker 1:          44:02          He has a, he has a screen shot of him.

Speaker 4:          44:06          Not a screenshot that it was a screenshot of like his, the response to the voter registration things set that says vote wasn't it?

Speaker 1:          44:12          Oh, whistleblowers. Whistleblower came out and made a video. She made a video and explained everything, how they trained or what to do. And what they did is they supposedly, this is what she said, that they told her that anybody, cause you could vote for a candidate but not be part of a party. You could just say, I'm not Democrat. I'm not a Republican. I'm a whatever her name. There's a name for it. No, uh, political, whatever representation. I don't know what the fuck it is, but you're, you're that third, that third class. So if most of those people were voting for Bernie, so they weren't either, they weren't Democrat or Republican, so they were on that third pile and that third pound on and those votes got counted. Whoa. That's what, that's what the conspiracy theory is and that's huge shit. Huge, huge. I mean, yeah, that's an, your vote doesn't count.

Speaker 1:          44:58          Well that's also what happened during the Al Gore, George W elections where they said that if you actually counted the real numbers of people that voted like all that dangling Chad Bullshit, if you actually count the actual results after they sorted it all out, Al Gore won. He won the election. I mean this is like pretty well established, but it's one of those things where you know how referee stops a fight for the wrong reason. Once they stopped the fight, the fight stopped. Yeah. It's nothing. It's kind of the same thing with [inaudible]. They're so terrified of this idea of losing the power that they get from controlling the leader of the world, which is exactly what it is. When you just decided someone's a president, if you got to a point where you're like, this is so stupid, why are we still having presence? And everybody agreed there'd be no one person that would have that position of power.

Speaker 1:          45:47          They're so terrified of that, that even in it, it like some sort of a crazy dispute where Al Gore like may or may have not. Obviously I didn't count them, but if you count them all up and you listen to a lot of the people that did, they said that Al Gore won that election. He should have won that election easy and like we're not even going to entertain it. Just not even going to entertain. And Adler backs away. And then the same thing happened with Carrie didn't, same thing happened with Carrie. There was like some dispute as to whether or not carry one or didn't mean Al Gore was a, for sure thing, k was close. But Carrie was an issue too. There was a, there was some sort of a dispute with Carrie too. I think with all those guys, it's like the game is so fucking wacky.

Speaker 1:          46:25          It's so the game of controlling the Geo political power of the world and controlling the greatest nation the world has ever known and the best people we can get. The people that were we're voting on right now, it's ridiculous. All the smartest people aren't going to run to watch a documentary on Youtube called behind the Iran Contra affair. You'll get to see, this is all public shit. The Iran Contra affair that shows you how ever help help people get honey deck. It shows you everything. Watch that chronicles, the Clinton chronicles and behind the Iran Contra affair. It's fucking nuts. Don't get a star on top seven. Well we don't have to go to that though. I rent contract fares is undeniable. It's one of those, the Iran Contra affair is one of those conspiracy theories that's so legit and so verified and so proven that it opens a door to a lot of other stuff cause you go, well wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          47:20          How the fuck did they think they could pull off this? How do they, how did they sell drugs in the La Ghettos to fund these crazy military operations? Nothing centuries, dude. What they did, it was they sold drugs in the ghetto like they sold, look, here's the thing, if you know, it was like two dozen people running all that shit. They're not that many. Not that many. You know? And that's one of the things that the CIA guys, when you, when you get to know them and you start communicating with them and realize, okay, there's some cowboys that realize that they're kind of operating on their own and they realized they could make a lot of money and they went for it. And I think that's what happened. Military connection in a lot of tape makes it happen. I think that happened in a lot of cases. And there's a lot of dudes who sold drugs and did all kinds of other shit because there's a lot of other people doing it and they, they like, fuck these people.

Speaker 1:          48:11          Why didn't, should these people make this money? And we could take this money. And we can go do some other shit. And they got caught with it. They got caught funding the war with the contractors and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. That was during the Oliver North trials. All that crazy shit dude. It was bananas. They got comp buffed it. There's like here, here it is right here was the 2004 election stolen Republican's prevented more than, what does that say? 350,000 votes in Ohio article written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr in rolling stone. Whoa. Kenny Jr. Yeah, so you see there's always these debates and disputes about elections, but I think at a certain point in time, like as a people, we have to come to this conclusion, this idea of giving all the power to one group like this is just, it's intoxicating. It's dangerous, it's not good for them.

Speaker 1:          49:00          It's not good for us. It's not good for anybody. We Shit, we shouldn't have these groups that have so much power over what you do or what you don't. And especially like what the fuck happens with the future of the world? Like who are these people? Like why? Why do they? Because we decide cause everybody raises their hand. They point to a guy, that guy gets to choose. This is madness. We get to stop doing it. Old School, it's old school for sure. Ran Contra scandal was when Ronald Reagan was president and George Senior was vice president. George scene was vice president. He was the former director of the CIA. He's right there. Vice President, actor fucking president during, that's when they were, George Bush was running all kinds of game through the CIA and uh, they got caught selling arms to Iran through Israel. We were supposedly, that was, those were our enemies.

Speaker 1:          49:54          But, and then they said it was because they needed a free the hostages. So that's why they were selling arms to them. But sounds like a reasonable deal. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's some old shit. Nothing light him up. Now the sweet guns check these out were just making money. The guys that were handling the deals that were just skimming all the money and that they got busted. So the guys that got indicted, there was like four dudes. As soon as George W. Bush or Jordan, not w George singer became president, he pardoned all those guys. You let them all

Speaker 3:          50:28          out of jail. It was gangster sleeps fog, they're gangsters and, and it's public knowledge and no one can do anything about it and you just can't do shit about it. So crazy. Like you can't do anything about any of that shit. That shit was all public knowledge. They were, they had the hearings in front of Congress on public television for two or three weeks. It was huge. I remember it got busted and guess what? Nothing. Guess what? George senior became president. How about that? How about that? But I, gangster movie, He became president and then he got his retard son to become president. He wasn't, just wasn't. So how about, how about this? How about this? How about this? When he was vice president, when all that should happen, so when those dudes got busted, he pardoned him once he became president and the guy responsible for all, for, for allowing all the drugs to come in illegally through the CIA.

Speaker 3:          51:26          When Bill Clinton was Bill Clinton in Arkansas. He was the governor. Guess what? After George singers, President Bill Clinton, that takes us, he was next. He said, what's up? He said, hey, let us run this shit. Three a goddamn state and we'll hook you up. We'll let you be president for a few years. What about that? It's hard to, it's hard to argue with facts. I mean, Arkansas Gang, so Barry seal's connection. Watch the crib. The Clinton chronicles, watch that show and said, dude, that Clinton Quantico's. You'll see how it, when he was, when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, he was gangster. He was the most gangster. Oh, he's got that soprano guy in the White House. That's nothing. That's a no Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton was, that's all he cared about was pussy. That's all I cared about. And there's whistleblower after whistleblower. That's what he was known for.

Speaker 1:          56:24          for those because they have to be, they have to be rated to go over 200 miles an hour, not burn. Those things are insane. They're all slicks, you know, they don't have any tread on them. That's the thing about those tires. They're like this really soft sticky component and so they, they kinda like drive with them and heat them up and move around with them and then once they heat them up real good, they become super adhesive. Yeah. Real sticky. And you could just take you down. No, no. Stick to the crib to the road like a Gecko. It's way better because you don't get as retired. See that Jamie? That's Nascar dog.
