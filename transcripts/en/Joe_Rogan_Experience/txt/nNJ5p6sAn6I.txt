Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Which was really that excited. Yes. Hello, any. I'm good. How are you? A sports sunglasses. I like those glasses. Glasses, sunglasses. This is. This is how I look in your face. Well thanks. It's a good choice. We do have been flirting with me since I arrived. A little bit casual. Nothing weird. Just the way you button that shirt all the way up to the top. That little top button. The Jean Jacket, that Jay Leno's garage. Look. Yeah, I just came from dot Levins podcast. So, uh, we were just talking about the fights. I'd stopped you before we actually talked. We were just feeling like, like this is more evidence that we are living in a computer simulation. Like everything is getting weirder. Politics is the most bizarre. I mean it's, everything is falling apart and it's like the Matrix. Programmers can't keep up with the code. Do you think that maybe like when one or two things go weird, like the election?

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       I think the election, I think having a reality star television host guy who's a media mogul become the president of United States is so odd to people that I think it gives us this feeling of instability and that feeling of instability, instability has like a ripple effect and it starts to fuck with all these other aspects of our reality and then these blurbs just start popping up and these weirdnesses what's Kinda like rather than it being a proof that it's a simulation. This is the most reality we've had in a long time. Right? Like we've all been living in this like pseudo thi this theater of stability, that hype. I'm sure you've talked about hypernormalization on this podcast before having to. I think the documentary, it's real good if people haven't caught up to it yet. It's on youtube and in its entirety, it's dense. It's not like a light.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       It's not a light fun documentary is like a three hour long British guide droning on too, like found footage on pvc. But his basic point is that, you know, society is unstable and has been for a very long time. That greenland is melting, we have nukes second, destroy us at any point, and there was no way for the leaders to actually run a functional and stable society. So what they do instead is they put up this artifice of stability. Meanwhile, shit is fucking collapsing behind the set and basically prove out example uses the Soviet Union, right? Is like Soviet Union stopped working almost immediately, right? They, they tried this utopic communistic beautiful society and everything fell apart immediately. Everybody knew what fell apart. Everyone in in, in, in Russia knew it wasn't working, but it, it served them more to pretend that it was working. And so people got into this willful, a sort of voluntary suspension of disbelief. This voluntary cognitive dissonance to like say, oh no, everything's good. Even though they go to the fucking the store, there's no bread. They would just get. Everybody was walking around as if it was real. So maybe when somebody like trump gets elected this fake realness of like everything's good Americans. Awesome. What a wonderful place. A utopic society with all these freedoms. Maybe that rips the seam. Then Anthony Rumble, Johnson retired from MMA or something.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Wow. Where do you go with that? I think there's always been problems with society, right? I mean, if you go back to ancient Rome, you know, have you ever visited the coliseum? Yeah. Yeah. Fascinating. Right? It crazy. Yeah. And when you think about it, that's only, you know, you're only talking about a thousand, 2000 years ago, right? Like when did, when did it all start in Rome? Rome was around for, for 2000 years. Right, right. I mean there were like 10 times as long as this American superpower has existed. So. Yeah. And they were. But the thing is they didn't have the technology to strip mine the world the way we do technology has now caught up human evil or whatever it is, or human avarice has always been probably equal. Right? But my point was that there's never been like any example of a society or a true Utopian society that was like really together, very relaxed.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       People are Nice. There was no war, there was no crime, there's no rape. There was no stealing. The best example of that is hippie communes, right? Because they're specifically designed to create a mini utopia and they always fall apart with a guy at the top. Fucking everybody flies every time. It's never not happened. A friend of mine's ex-girlfriend grew up in one of those and she was so fucked up because of it. They're always fucked up. Yeah. They're all the best you'll ever get out of a guy or a girl that grew up in one of those communes is like, um, it was in, there was some really good parts that's as good as you can get. Yeah. And that's someone that's just really kind. Yeah. I mean they, people always try to reengineer cycling. I was, I was reading something today about, um, a free housing that free housing should be a universal right for people that everyone should have free housing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:55       You know, and I was reading this was taking a shit so I didn't go into it too deeply, but that immediately I was thinking, well, who's gonna build the housing. Like how is that a right? Like, it can't have a universal. Right? If some people just don't want to build a house and they don't want to work and they don't want to do anything and they want somebody else to build a house for them, that's always going to be a possibility. Like. Sure. Yeah. Right. I mean, I guess. Right. But what are rights rights are completely constructed, right? I mean, sure, a lion has no right to loan that. That should be a right, but the right to privacy rabbit of a lion or a ape has no rights. It's just an ape getting eaten and fucked by its neighbor. Right? So we decided what rights are so that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       So the same idea that says something. Anything is a right. You could also say, yeah, housing is a right. If, if society deems that that's true, I guess. Or if society has the resources, we do have the resources. That's true of right. I think yeah, I would. I would imagine we have the rights or the resources rather than how's everybody in the car? Not In the best way. Not a sweet apartment, but you know what I mean. Just a roof over your head. Warmth. Yeah. I think like the idea that we were getting way into the theoretics of taxation and civil responsibility, but like the idea that we spend trillions of dollars on a protective military when we are, we've lapped every other military so many times over. Like we could everybody, every homeless person. I mean there are countries where they don't have homeless people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       They just don't know. I've been in Israel and it's like people who are homeless in Israel or there are homeless because they're crazy and want to be homeless or my, my brother was just in um, uh, one of those, one of those super white countries, Switzerland, I think it was Switzerland. And everybody was like, yeah, we don't have. I mean, this is crazy. What he told me, he was like, what's this, what society? Like you're like, it's cool, you know, we don't have like a poverty. So that's cool. Like they don't have poor people. Yeah. That's not a part of their society. Is that Switzerland? Is that. What is that? I think it was Switzerland. They have, they figured out a way to make money on the Bank of Denmark is Kinda like that too. Yeah. I mean northern Europe, they, they've done something right. I think. Well, I think they're also dealing with a very small population of people that have existed for a long time in the same place.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Right. And you kind of normalize and they've never conquered their conquerors, you know, they're not spreading their resources thin across the globe, making battleships and shit. Right. I was thinking about you on the way over here. I think this is connected. I was thinking about you and the flirtation we were going to be doing and I was wondering, because you're bent, I've watched her stand up since trump got elected and you and a lot of the guys at the store or I would say I've always taken the store, like a libertarian, a intellectual epicenter of comedy. Right. And then like if you go to go east it becomes more and more like socialist further to travel. Right. And um, I guess what I'm the hot, it's like the neocons, but at any rate, um, I would say your bent is like, everything's fucking fine. You're, you're crying, you're making a crisis that doesn't exist.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       And I was wondering, do you still think that it's not necessarily really my bent, it's the way that it works now. That's a real comedian. Yeah, the community as well. Actually I believe it's just one of the things that I say on stage. Like I say, like, um, like a lot of the stuff I say it was fucked up. So if I say anything that's, that you don't agree with, I don't agree with a lot of Shit I say, but it's funnier than when I agree with like some of the things I say clearly fucking around. And then some of the things I say it's like where's he, is he on the fence on this? But what a lot of it is, is just to set up this idea that the whole system has always been preposterous. Totally. It's just that it's weird. It's almost our fault, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:41       Because he'd take a guy like a Clinton or a guy like an Obama who's fairly successful at the job and people are just constantly trying to find chinks in the armor, constantly trying to find cracks in who he is. And it was Clinton and obviously it was the philandering with Obama. There was a chink, the size of a pussy. Chinks sounds like a weird word to use even if you're not using it. And erase the word niggardly got in trouble for saying niggardly. Yeah. And they were like, you can't say that word. It's like, but it's not even etymologically connected to the n word. And we were like, we don't care. It's spelled differently. Not the same root word that like, don't use it, but I feel that way about swastikas. Do you know those hippy swastikas and the Indians Swastika and all these hippies and am like, you know, Buddhists are always like, yes, it's a different spots to cuts a special swastika, the good swastika.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       It's like the good witch and the bad witch from the wizard of Oz. And I'm like, alright, that's cool Buddhist, but I think you should just abandon the good swastika. You gotta own. You've got other shit you could do. It was a symbol used in Okinawa and karate. Oh really? Yeah. Actually it's made its rounds. Right? Because he was in India, in, in a Hindu temples, Okinawa. Maybe that's Buddhism, Hinduism to Buddhism to karate. I like that. I don't know where, where, why it was in there. But I remember seeing it a long time ago in a store like this Okinawan karate book. And there was this like these symbols and I was like this bizarre, like a swastika is a part of karate, but it might've been reversed, you know? Sometimes they do it the opposite way, but yeah, that's symbols gone. You got to let that go.

Speaker 1:          00:10:16       Well let's just abandon that one. Then you could walk away from that with you got other symbols. It's like a lot like the Hitler mustache, like there's no need. I mean look, chaplain suffered, but no, I bet Mr. Mr Miyagi was like, you know, wax on, wax off, put that swastika on your shoulder. Isn't it funny that you could just stretch that bitch just a little bit and you're okay if you just trim it just light. Oh, you're talking about. But yeah, as long as it's not the actual Hitler. If you just stretch it slightly towards the corner of your mouth, you just keep going. Just bring that bitch back like this. You're okay. I thought you were being so vulgar for a second and that you just had the most like pornography pornographic thought ever. That crazy. If you just stretch that bitch just a little bit, you're just.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       You're okay. Just stretch it. Stretch it. But his mouth. I was thinking about a pussy. No, no, no. Wow. That's weird that you just went there and we're talking about Hitler's mustache. Well, I get turned on. When I think about the Nazis, I got a real, like some of the synopsis in my Jewish Brain got cross. She called that desk the next special mouth. Fucking Hitler stretching Hitler's mouth. But isn't it a weird thing like that mustache, like it's. There's a certain amount of space it can cover on your lip and it's okay because as long as it goes far enough left and right where I. Okay. You know, I mean the Hitlers haircut is making a huge comeback. That's right. And people get in trouble for that haircut. I was the first guy, I mean I was on the first wave, I would say I was in the, not the first right of hipsters reclaiming that haircut.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       Well it's like a longer on the side, write longer on the side, sort of puffy on the top. I mean it's, you got rocky hit late night. I used to know this. This is, I've changed since because it got too cool and I truly am a hipster. I follow, I follow where the trends go, but I used to have a, I used to have a bit about it, about the dilemma that a Jew has when he's telling a barbara what he wants. And the only, the quickest way to describe it, it's just to say Hitler. So you want something, you know, like a kind of old timey, kind of a like a military cut like Hitler, Hitler, the destroyer of my people make me look like him. And then the punch, the tag was as my grandparents turned over and they're shallow unmarked graves. Anyway. Yeah, let's start.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Yeah, it was dark. But my point was originally, not really that I had a point, but when we chipping away at this thing, like we know that politicians are doing an act. We know that there when, you know, I've always mocked the way they communicate, like the way they give speeches, the long pauses in this very distinct pattern of behavior that's completely alien to anything other than a political speech. Like the only way this country survives, you know, like that kind of the strange thing that they do. But when, when we're always like chipping away at that, we're always trying to like get to like be real key. We gotta get, we gotta find out what's real and then we get this guy who realer than anyone's ever been. Yeah. And we're like, well fuck this, this is crazy. And it scares us. That's the point of that documentary we like to be lied to.

Speaker 1:          00:13:09       It makes us all feel calm and comfortable to be given a stable lie than to be shown the real truth of how fucked up and unstable everything. Yeah, I mean the. The trailer has this text over over, just like stock footage. It's just. And it's so scary. It's the words are a politicians lie to us. We know they lie, they know, we know they lie, they just don't care. And I just always sent chills down my spine because it's so true and everybody knows it. And yet we're all engaged in this willful suspension of disbelief. Like, no, no, no, everything's good. You know? No, both America's both the greatest country on earth and it needs to be made great. Again. It's like we're all in this weird, like we're unclear on what were even arguing for. It's almost like what trump's done is put a totally new engine in the heart of the car.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       It's like if you have an old car like Washington and it relies on a combustion engine and then someone comes along and puts an electrical engine and then you're like, whoa, whoa, Whoa, what are you saying? You don't need congress anymore. You don't need the Senate. You don't need this. You don't need that. You don't need the cronies. You don't need the lobbyists. You have this whole new system and you don't need to pretend to talk like that. Even more importantly, you don't need to do the theatrics anymore. You can be a real, the real terrible person who always wore and everybody goes along with it. That's the weirdest thing to me about this election is not the president himself, excuse me, but how many people on line who you've never seen politically engaged are now in it like like a, like a sports fan? You know? I do understand well to the people that hate trump. I understand because what it did was

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       it disrupted our programming on such a profound level that people. I was talking to somebody last night that said that it was much more disturbing when trump got elected. Then nine slash 11 was to them, and I understand that sentiment because nine slash 11 was a terrible event. This feels like a terrible new chapter in American history, but nine slash 11 happened while Bush was in office and Dick Cheney was the vice president. He was one of the scariest guys to ever have no doubt, and that is the. I mean, I think the best point that you're making is like Dick Cheney's pretending that he's stable while meanwhile he's like Japan stowing evil in to bombing Iraq and you know, do you want a guy that makes you feel somewhat comfortable and stable? Who is actually the most evil Satan fucker in the world or a guy that makes you feel the evil but isn't as bad.

Speaker 3:          00:15:45       Way more transparent. His motivations. I mean, Cheney was the ceo of Halliburton and then all sudden Halliburton wants to bomb Iraq. You know, he does rather they get these billion dollar, multibillion dollar, no bid contracts to rebuild what they've bombed and you're like, Jesus Christ, a little kid can connect the dots here. This is, this is insane.

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       I always just wonder what, how much money do you want? I never quite get it like you're willing to just in. It just seems too simple to me to go, oh no, they just wanted money like. But there's, there's a lot. They all had a lot of money. When I talk to a big businessman, now

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       you know what it is, man. It's the deal. It's all about the deal. It's all about closing deals, making deals, closing deals, and winning. That's what it's all about. It's like, that's like saying to someone that loves video games. Why are you playing video games? Like why are you playing them? You've already played. You played it, you've got the game. You know how to play a game. Why keep playing? Because they're getting a little juice out of it. Every time they do it at the closing deals or buying a new yacht. I've got an amazing, amazing New York, the biggest shot ever, so the most wonderful yacht, the yacht. You'll see this yacht. It's amazing. Wait to you see it. It's incredible. The biggest yacht. That's trump at a nutshell, right? I, yeah. Do would you want the biggest yacht? No, I wouldn't either. Well, I know a guy has one.

Speaker 3:          00:17:00       It's a giant target. You have to have like have these military guys at guard this fucking thing because he'll. What they'll do is they'll travel this yacht without him just south of France and then he flies in private jet of course flies in to the south of France and this private jet climbs out and then they have to escort him to his gigantic multi hundred million dollar house that floats in the water and you have to keep people from getting on your lawn. Essentially the like the lawn becomes all the water around your multibillion dollar house or multimillion dollar house

Speaker 2:          00:17:33       and it's just so that you can show your other billionaire friends like, look what I got. Well it's also probably fun as fuck to take no doubt floating mansion

Speaker 3:          00:17:41       out there on the south of France, but I guess it's just why else have the money? I mean, why not? If you're balling and you enjoy

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       all that stuff, like I guess they just want more. They just keep. Keep going. There's something more to it than just the acquisition of money because once you have a billion dollars, you can afford thing all of the things that you need or can afford. All those things though. See One of these mansions, like if you, if you look at a mansion like a crazy fucking Hampton's mansion, you know, you could get one of those for like $50 million, $50 million, $100,000,000 before taxes, right? Taxes, expenses, sales tax. You have to makeup, you have to earn profit of $100,000,000 to get the $50,000,000 mansion and then that's not, that's not shit. Compared to some of these yachts, like a yacht can go for half a billion. Like they have yachts, like what's the most expensive yet we, we've covered this before, wasn't it like a billion? I think it's a billion.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       A billion dollars for a boat. A billion dollar million dollar boat. Yeah. And then what we'll do, you have to have a jack about how empty you feel inside when you sit the first night and your billion dollars. It depends on how much coke you're doing. You might feel totally full full of coke and hookers. Yeah, you probably do. And you have three phone calls going on at the same time doing deals and that is why I 100 percent believe the reports of that streets of Monaco $1,000,000,000. That is crazy. Yeah, it's, it's a castle on a boat that floats in the water. It's insane. Yeah. Well that's a battleship. That's an aircraft carrier. Well, it's really like a city. I mean, look how it's designed. I mean it looked the outside of it. It all looks like this amazing block and what this is theoretical, but they will build for someone if they give them a billion dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       Uh, let's see. The difference in a yacht and number three, which is a $650,000,000, it's triple the cost. What is a billion buying? You will nothing yet. This one still in construction. The design, that fantastic yacht, unlike the traditional model. So this is the probably the most. It's so it's a replica of a casinos and the Monaco Grand Prix track. It's so funny to me that you spend a billion dollars on something and it looks that fucking Gadi and disgusting, like there's nothing about that that looks cool other than it's billion this. Yeah, that's the only. It looks cool because it's. It's mimicking Monaco number, but the number two one is how much that one, Jamie, that's foreign and $50 million to one point $2 billion and I'm sorry, anybody with a billion dollar yacht should be murdered. I don't think I'm going out on a limb by saying that they should be killed.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Okay. It costs a billion dollars. Maybe we don't know the exact cost of building such a monstrosity, but various source of listed the price of construction. Even as high as one point 5 billion. It's manned by 70 crew members and owned by Russian billionaire. Roman Abramovich contains its own private defense system designed to detect intruders and camera wielding spectators. Wow. It's got a laser to kill to. We get that. It uses modern light technology to block the cameras. Is Room for 24 to hell. IPADS and has its own private submarine. By the time you get the private submarine money, something's gone very right and very wrong in your life, especially if you're. If you're a Russian billionaire, you have to be in bed with Putin. Oh, you have to. Yeah. You can't just like be. I'm just politically agnostic. You, you'll be straight up drinking a arsenic at some point or they'll just take your company and lock you up.

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       I mean, they've done that to a bunch of oligarchs. He'd just takes your company, puts you in the pokey. But I wonder, um, do you think that you can be that there are. I mean, I guess like Bill, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet seemed like Nice people, but it seems like if you're a billionaire, you're probably like at least a cousin of evil, like you've done something terrible. Is that true though? I mean, it's got. There's gotta be a way to be an ethical billionaire if there is a way to make a million dollars ethically, which we believe there is. There's gotta be a way to make a billion. I mean, it's just a matter of keeping going, I guess. Buffet seems like a good guy, but then you get into what good guy means for a billionaire. Right? Like good buffets, good guy is like, I will allow $800, million to go to AIDS in Africa, but I will not allow that same 800 million to go to famine in Somalia.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       So there's a kind of a weird moral arbiter thing that happens which happens to the president to. It's like when people point out that like Obama bombed people with drones. I, I'm A. I was pretty disgusted by a lot of things Obama did, but it's like that is part of the morality of being a world leader is you have to be comfortable with a morality that includes killing innocent people. And that's why I would never want to be the leader of anything. Only one reason why there's a ton of reasons why you'd never want to do that job. Yeah. The worst. But I, you know, there's this idea that people love the president, which also like really kind of blows my mind. Like why do we, why do we love our president? They don't love the president in every country. There was a super disturbing video that a guy no took where he was at the inauguration and trump is coming up the stairs and as trauma's coming stairs, all supporters, right?

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       This is, uh, you know, the, the heart of his love and as he's coming up the stairs, people are clapping and applauding and this guy next to this guy I know who's holding the camera says, thank you, Mr Trump. You are a godsend. Thank you sir. Thank you very much. And it's, and he barely acknowledges that guy of course, just because it was $100 million people. Right? And he wanders up the stairs and goes through the room and all these people are following him with the camera on them. I think that's what a guy like that once he wants somebody to say that to him. Yeah. He wants to be that guy. I understand actually being trucked in that situation and want people to worship you. I, I can get there. I'm a comedian that's, that's close enough to a desperate ego where you like laugh at me is similar to worship me, but why do we worship politicians? I can't wrap my brain around it. Like Gore Vidal

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       said that he called it the uniquely American religion of worshiping the president. Well, I think it goes back to the fact that we've never had a king, so our president is a different thing and I think the idea to have the one alpha is just some ancient ape shit. Yeah. One hundred percent does only makes sense. There's always an Alpha champ. There's an Alpha gorilla and there's just like these, these hierarchies exist in the primitive versions of us. Why wouldn't they exist in the most advanced? That's really interesting. I never thought about it like that. Like A, we're so intelligent that we've created a stratified Alpha pyramid that is $300 million big with a parliamentary system and a constitution, but it's still just a bunch of apes know running around, you know, 2001 in. I mean, even like, go back to what we're talking about, like Bill Gates, who's this in incredibly, uh, what, what, what he's done charitably is amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:24:43       He does a lot of great stuff with his money mean their foundation is really, really beneficial to a lot of people, but everybody knows him as the king ape of Microsoft. I mean, that's how these businesses work. Tim Cook, that's the king eight of Apple. You know, we always have a king ape or queen ape, right? Very rarely a queen a put when we have. It doesn't seem to work out. When named Queen Eight that Toronto is chick was a big queen a, but it didn't work out because it turns out she was a fraud. Who's Toronto's? You don't want to story. No. Oh, it's amazing. It's amazing story. It's a story of something where people wanted something to be true. So they kind of said yes. We finally have and they didn't do any investigating on it until finally somebody actually did. I think it might've been the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       It took it down, but I was just woman Elizabeth something or another. She, she founded this company called Toronto. There she is, Elizabeth Holmes, and she dressed like Steve Jobs. She wore a black turtleneck black stuff. She acted like she was this super genius character and when she was 19 she left college to start this company called Toronto. And Toronto is a company that would do this. I'm very cheap and effective blood scan, like they would take a drop of your blood, prick your blood and test you for all sorts of different diseases. And um, it turns out it doesn't work at all. It's just a black box. No, but just hugely ineffective. And she was worth in one point in time $34 billion dollars because of what this company was assessed as being valued at which she could have been able to do. And um, it turned out that they started looking into it and then there was a whistleblower from the company that was saying that she was ignoring all the negatives and concentrate on the positives. And these people know untold, tens of thousands. And even, I think maybe even a

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       million people were put it. How many people find out how many people were tested by this shit, but they were all put at risk because it's hugely effective, like off by like 40, 50 percent negatives and positives and just wasn't right. It just was wrong all the time. Does this idea that she was going to bypass this traditional system and they were putting them in like walgreens and stuff like that and allowing people to get tested and screened for all these diseases and it really wasn't effective, but she was one of the very rare king queen chimps were the matriarchal society was, you know, her business and it didn't work. You conflating the collapse of the business to know. I'm just saying she was the only one that I can think of. What would that have been very effective female world leaders though. Top, top chimp, golden my ear, Margaret Thatcher.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       Merkel what's the woman that got blown up in some very effective women? You're like, what's the one that got blown up? Who Am I thinking of the, uh, who was killed? Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's a famous goddammit shipper. Names of the tip of my tongue. Oh, early morning podcasts. Motherfucker day after travel. Stupid. What? What country? Don't remember. One of the Middle Eastern ones that they killed a woman. Yeah. I don't remember. You know what I'm talking about Jamie? God dammit. We'll call the line right now if you know what woman got blown up. It's a famous story because it happened in our lifetime. A Jamie, you'll find it. God dammit her. Her name's at the tip of my tongue. This is driving me fucking crazy. Just like blown up like right next to her limo.

Speaker 4:          00:28:20       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Anyway. Um, it's just. Yeah. Margaret Thatcher is a good example. Yes. But uh, like companies like lily, we were talking about like Bill Gates and stuff like that. You never see that rent. Oh, at the top. At the top of a Qa. Carly Fiorina you got. She was the head of, uh, she ran the Republican, one of the Republican people that ran for president this and she was at Hewlett Packard. I wanted something like that maybe. Yeah. What do you think it is? You really think it's just an ape shit? Well, I think there's definitely some women that have a more masculine characteristics and enjoy the competition of the board room and that kind of stuff more than some women do, but I think that a day. Yeah. Then the country was at Pakistan, Pakistan, right. I was gonna say Pakistan, but didn't want to fuck it up. Um, yeah. I don't know. I mean, what, what is a masculine characteristics? What's a feminine characteristics? Obviously there's massive variations in, in both genders, but why are almost all lead? It's the patriarchy man. I mean, it is the patriarchy. I think it is. What does that mean though? What it means is that therapists, there are systems in place and maybe are biological systems is what suggesting

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       it's a primary thing and maybe their societal systems. Probably the truth is that they're both. And I think that a person that really believes in, in like feminism and patriarchy would say the societal systems are more, are the bigger, the bigger issue. Uh, but even you can believe in the patriarchy that's biological, but just that it's more, there's a barrier to entry that starts in kindergarten. It starts in child rearing that would, that, that every, in order for a woman to become a CEO, they have to have to jump every hoop higher than the male that want is on the same path because there are systems or structural systems in place that want to snip smack that woman down towards like a more what is perceived as a no do something a little bit more feminine. And so they, in order to be, it's this idea that is true with all oppressed people that in order to be average you have to be great.

Speaker 2:          00:30:32       And I, I saw that directly with like my mother who's a deaf and uh, in order I just, the deaf community is so fascinating and weird, but like in order to be what my mother is, which is like a, she has a master's degree and she's college educated. You have to try 20 times as hard as an average person that wants to get a master's degree because there's so much insane barrier to entry from day one from the first day you were born. So I think that's the patriarchy I don't think is really up for debate. I mean even if you believe just in a biological imperative, men are in charge and therefore they keep women from getting to positions of being in charge. So in order to get up there, in order to be a ceo you have to be more aggressive, more powerful, more more Steve Jobs, you gotta put a put more turtle necks on.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       Well yeah. But is that, is that the actual system that's in place or are there far more men who want to do that job?

Speaker 2:          00:31:25       But why would there be more men that want to do the job? That's a good question. Isn't it

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       natural? I mean, is it natural for women to gravitate towards nursing and physicians and, and healthcare because that is overwhelmingly run by women,

Speaker 2:          00:31:38       but then why are they, for example, why aren't they, why don't they gravitate towards being a doctor if there is a lot of women do. Yes. Yeah, but, but doc be being a doctor is largely and historically dominated by men and there something that's the case anymore. It might not be anymore. You know, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is like if you look at a woman and say, oh, well they, like, they are biologically predisposed to nurture, then you would say, oh, okay. Then it would make sense that all of the great doctors of history would have been women or, or it would have been dominated in the same way nursing has.

Speaker 3:          00:32:10       Well not necessarily because a lot of the great doctors in history, you're talking a lot about science. You're talking about the ability to recognize issues before anyone else does and try to like formulate some sort of a solution to figure out some biological issue. A lot of that is science and obviously science has been dominated by men for the longest time. The real questions are why. Right, right. And for sure there's been some sexism, right? There's, for sure there's been some oppressing of, uh, women's, uh, ideas

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       and their ambitions and entering into certain fields. And there's old boys clubs where they don't want women around because he can't talk about pussy. And you can talk about mustaches. Hitler, Hitler, pussies, you know, I mean there's a certain amount of freedom that men enjoy when they were around only other men and that's in place because they're the, they are the Alphas of society. And so like the freedom that we desire as men. And I'm not. Look, I'm like uh, uh. Woke boy, I'd like lefty but I still am a man. Whoa boy. Well, you know, like, like I consider myself a political progressive and I do believe in and you say, do you ever say I'm so woke? I mean ironically I will hashtag woke. Hashtag stay woke all day, every day. Hashtag I eat meat, but that. No, that's yours. Hashtag I eat meat. You always hashtag things.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       I eat meat sometimes. I don't always. I think I made it may have. Well you, when you have like an what? Do you have? Like a seared duck? Yeah. I enjoy watching your elk. Elk. Instagram. Thanks man. Yeah. Do you eat meat? I eat meat. Yeah. Um, yeah, I eat meat. It's a weird one, right? Neat. No, it's a weird. It's a weird thing like a admitting like you've got to go because we know if you're a real progressive, if you're real caring person, it's like, okay, you're eating murdered animals. I mean, I don't, I don't think that I am as a, as ardent a meat eating supporter as you are, but I also am not a. There is a moral imperative not to eat meat, right. I, I fall somewhere in the middle, which is. I mean, I think every thinking person falls in the middle, which is meat probably isn't an obviously immoral thing to eat because we want it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       We are, we are, we are animals and we want need and if we didn't, why does a lie in the meat? And we shouldn't. Well, we're not a carnivore, but we are an Omnivore, right? I, I believe that, but there's a lot of people that say we're not. That's the big argument. You know, I have this weird herbivores. I will. Yeah. It's odd to say the word divorce because we're not like Mcdonald's. Mcdonald's, right? It's not just that. I mean, not that we can get away with eating it, but their faces designed for it. Right, right. Yeah. For for a big block. Actually. Perfectly. Actually. Have you heard about the new big Mac? No. So there's a new hamburger at Mcdonald's. It's a big Mac, but if you don't want all that food, it's a. they've taken out one button and one patty, so it's just a.

Speaker 1:          00:34:58       it's a cheeseburger, but they're calling to the mack Jr. This is the kind of pernicious. Real demenTia is a fucking cheeseburger. So that's what they're calling it. That's so stupid. The mac. There it is. Jesus. Come back to you and your solid one less layer. So it has the same amount of patties. Is that to patties? No, it's not. It's one less patty. One less button. It's a fucking cheeseburger. And they're like, oh no, no, no. But it comes with our special sauce. Oh, so it's a bad cheeseburger. I used to have a joke that actresses are like big macs. They never look as good as their pictures. It's like, when's the last time you saw a big back like that? Like god damn, that looks great. Wait, what about the third big mac? The grand mac. Oh, they're going, what's in the grant? for those that didn't think the big mac was big enough, it's a 100 percent beef patties ways.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       A third of a pound, two slices, one that this is the problem with two slices of melty, melty american cheese. What does that mean? It's like, well, it's not real cheese. So we call it melty, melty american cheese. It's melty american cheese is all one word. Melty american cheese. Stay woke. Stay melty cheese at all. Those I eat melty. I mean it's, this is the problem with me. It's not you shooting an elk with a fucking bow and arrow. It's mcdonald's. Like having like, you know, couch weights, you know, stacked up and like they'Re eating their own shit and we're all like just consuming it at the detriment of the global world. Green greenhouse gases. I mean, if only if everybody hunted to the way you hunt then then there would be no moral. There'd be no moral question about elk. They would starve. It wouldn't, we wouldn't make it, but I will.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       We don't. We don't even need meat. No, we don't need it. That's what I think the weird argument about veganism from a moralistic perspective can be. If you talk about it from an environmental perspective, it's very, very difficult. I always say like when you talk about, I don't know if I want to say this on your podcast, but when you talk to them about when you talk about environmental effects of neat, it's the same way that it feels the same as when you bring up the settlements in Israel, you can have all these great intellectual discussions on well actually, well, and then you bring up the environmental and you just go back. Can't defend that. There's no, there's no defense there. I feel the Same way with the settlements in Israel is like, I can make an impassioned plea for Israel and then when you bring up the settlements, I'm like, yeah, I got nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       Once you start bulldozing people, I don't know. I'm not sure what tanks, but we started this whole thing off with trying to figure out why women gravitate towards certain things and whether or not there'd be suppressed and this is a subject. It's almost like racism where, uh, if you're not a black person and you start talking about black lives matter, people go, hey, fuck head. Like whaT? What you, you either be ultra supportive or shut the fuck up now you get to be an ally or, you know, get out of the way. I hear that there is. Yeah, I hear that. And that's kind of representative I think of the way a lot of women feel like the struggle is so pervasive and it's so much a part of their lives and they don't get supported in it. And iT's so frustrating, especially a woman that is trying to climb the corporate ladder.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       Like I have a good friend who's a big tiMe executive. She was at google now setting up another one of those big tech companies and she's a super, super intelligent, super ambitious too. And she's one of Those rare women that um, well her mom's like that too. So it's kind of interesting, it's interesting when you meet her mom who's this older, super sharp lady, but she's just always been like the type of person that enjoys achieving. She'd like, this is like her mindset. She enJoys it. She likes to achieving problem solving. She likes getting deals done and she's a very nice person. It's not like she's some ruthless monster who, uh, does sit at forsaking all things for profit. It's a, but there's not a lot of women like that. It's not, it's not that many. So if you look at the great pool of humans, like how muCh of it is them being held back or how much of it is them being like really rare, like so.

Speaker 1:          00:38:50       So few people like that. If you get 100 women in the room is one of them, like my friend, I don't know. But the question always is why would there be so few women that are like that? There's no way, by the way, it's all an intellectual exercise because there's no way that you could strip away all the thousands of years of programming and systemic societal oppression to figure out, oh, if we're on it, I always make. I always think about like if I took 20, 20 kids, I used to think about this in terms of gender dysphoria and trans transgender ideas. Like if you were to take 50 kidS, 50 boys and 50 girls and go put them on a colony on the moon where they were raised by robots with no reference to their gender. What things would you find that were true about the women back home that were true of the women up there?

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Like if you could somehow strip away society altogether, then what would be leftover? What truly is male? What truly is female? And I think there's actually a, there is an intersection between meat eating and feminine and feminine and systemic feminism, which is really like human beings are this weird concoction of like conscious aware, awake woke boys and girls and little primate, you know, kill the alpha. You know, fuck the woman. My monkeys, and so we're trying to grapple with that constantly like is it in inherent in the notion that you should morally not eat meat is the idea that you are morally superior to an animal that can't discern between the moral correctness of eating meat and you know what I'm saying? Like if you're just an animal and you're just like any dog will eat anything you put in front of it. There's also, there's an Intellectual argument, right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       Like if you leave these animals loan to their own devices, what do they do? Well, they slaughter each other. I mean that's what. That's what they do. This is what it is, is a bunch of stuff that grows and there's a bunch of dumb stuff that eats the stuff that grows and then as much stuff that eats the dumb stuff and that's. That's nature and that really is the whole stuff that eats other mean stuff is mean stuff that he's bigger mean stuff and smaller mean stuff and then if you step in and you take some of those dumb things that are eating the grass, you can feel better [inaudible] healthy. Your body performs better and that's just a fact. I mean, there's a lot of people that want to say that meaning is bad for you. It is absolutely not. It's just not. What's bad for you.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       Sedentary lifestyle, what's bad for you, his sugar was bad for you is simple carbohydrates and high quantities. There's a lot of things that are bad for your processed foods are bad for your preservatives are very bad for you. There's a lot of things, carcinogens, all those things are bad for you, but just meat is protein and water. I mean that's really what it is, is a bunch of amino acids and there's a lot of vitamins in it and as long as you're not eating too much of anything, it's been proven that there's a lot of to eating

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       meat, first of all, be 12, which really doesn't even exist in a vegan diet unless you're taking in weird algaes and or bugs. Some people were willing to eat bugs. Bugs are the future, right? We're all goiNg to be eating crickets, but it's a weird thing. The distinctions of life, like we decide like for if you wanted to eat something that's really simple and stupid, like if your, if your issue is awareness or if you're, your issue is whether it's something sentient, eat mollusks. There are some of the dumbest fuckIng thing on the planet dumber. Even then plants, like plants communicate with each other. It's been proven. Michael pollan had some amazing work about it and not only that, they have, not only that, it's been proven that the communicate with each other, but they also produce human neurotransmitters. They produce like serotonin, like there's, there's some arguments that they, um, they actually allocate resources to support other plants in the community and talking about those like root systems or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:42:29       Yeah. They have a micrOrisal relationship with different funguses. Some trees where if you go into it, there's a group of elves make them cookies. Yeah, man, that's responsible for a lot of forest fires. Right? All those killing cookie up man. But one of those elves actually made it really far. He's actually the attorney general of our country. What's happened, jeff sessIons and now he was an [inaudible] guy. Yeah, one was, he was, he was like a top or doping, but the um, I think plants talk. I think it's interesting. I think they communicate with each other in a way that we don't understand. And this is one of the reasons I read, I think this, they've done these studies where they played the sound of caterpillars, played the sound of caterpillars munching on leaves next to an acacia tree and it changed the way the tree tastes.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       Like when, when you, there's certain trees that when they, they, when an animal's chewing them, the acacia bushes, a famous one when an animal's chewing them up wind. So like something's chewing it and then sent comes down wind to them, they changed their flavor profile and become a toxic tasting so that animals will actually starve to death rather than eat them. Oh, they changed so that the caterpillar won't eat them to discourage predation. Wow, thAt's wild. They do it based on sound, like they'll do it based on the smell, but also sound plants respond defensively. The sound of caterpillars eating their leaves. So they produce these, these poisons. So they, they taste like shit, but so that no one eats them and it literally will cause they figured this out from giraffes, but that's not evidence of sanctions. Well, it's evidence of some sort of communication because one, one plant way up there is communicating with the other plants that are nowhere near.

Speaker 3:          00:44:13       That's interesting. So okay. So all of the trees and the network will start tasting like shit just starts. Interesting. There's some sort of a network. Again, the michael pollan Book, I forget which book it was, where he goes into depth about this, but um, there's quite a few different, um, scientific papers that have been done on plant intelligent intelligence and it's a fairly new and emerging field and it's very disturbing field people that are vegan because they like to pretend that, okay, well we have, what we're doing is causing no harm. that's not true. Okay. Everyone causes harm. Life eats life. And one of the weird things that people do where they have no problem eating with their vegan. I'm just gonna eat vegetables. Well, large scale agriculture is one of the most devastating things that can happen to the ground that those plants are planted on you.

Speaker 3:          00:44:59       You complete, like if you see a field and it's like a thousand acres of corn that is so not normal. I mean that is just sO weird. And even if it's totally organic, right? Like you're, you're displacing all this wildlife to, to do that. You're changing that environment entirely. It's, you're stripping nutrients from the soil. are we like running toward a cliff? Yeah. And the way to put the nutrients back is you're dead. Things used fish are dead animals and that's how they get the nutrients back in the store. There's a, there was an interesting article article that uh, um, I tweeted a about a year back that everybody got so mad that it's actually impossible to be a vegetarian. And thIs is by someone who is a vegan saying this. What did they, what, what, what are they saying? You're not adjusting every animal, every plant like devours living things in order to stay alive and your devouring the nutrients from those living things like by eating these plants, you're eating something. There it is. It's actually impossible to be a vegetarians fascinating read because it's written by a vegan and it's. It's. It's a weird argument, but you realize, oh, there's this connection that's inexorable. Like it's not like these plants just live only on water

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       but isn't the. I mean, here's the idea that brings us back to this feminism idea and what structure on what is and isn't the idea that if you are. If you believe that humanity has a moral, it's encumbered upon humanity to be morally forthright in a more, to be more than an animal, then you have to reckon with what's the way that I can do the least harm in the world. I'm not saying I do that. I'm saying that is, that's the, that's the moral and intellectual idea of like, you know how to deal with systemic oppression, how to deal with a low impact diet. Like I think like there's no question that you hunting elk is in the framework of if I'm god in the acceptibility range, right? [inaudible], but then factory farMing And you know, worst Case scenario and worst case scenario is this is the scenario. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:47:01       I Think what also would happen is these societies that we enjoy these civilizations like New York city, la, they got too big before we engineered them before rather we engineered like I'm an engineer is the wrong word before we really managed the resources that you need to allocate to in order to feed 20, have 25 million people in the greater los angeles area. That's about all that shit. Yeah. It's a lot of, it's so

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       much shit. What do you do with the shit? Do you ever have a story of the ocean? You ever hear the story about New York city's shit? No. Where's it go? Pretty fascinating. So they basically, uh, it, it all goes in the same place. I mean, it all goes to plants, which is a treatment plan. It's not, not, not plants that feel and make themselves tastes bitter, but treatment plans. Right? So every, every shitty like, you know, lower eastside hipster and chinatown, chinese person and like upper east side, you know, do it all. There's little squiggly shits. I'll go into electric plants where they treat it and then their leftover with this pile of fucking big old New York city shit. And they're like, what do we do with the shit? They don't have a farm lands nearby. And so they basically, because a lot of it goes to fertilizer, so they started trying to take it out on the, on the free market you can sell shit on the free market.

Speaker 2:          00:48:16       Oh my god. Is that real? Yeah. You sell it to farms. And the funny part is that all these like Kansas and Indiana and like real down home corn, husky type of lasers, we're like, we're good. We don't want that big city city slicker shit to our community. Oh my god. Basically the stigma of New York, yankee ness was too big for them to accept the shit. Wow. Not even for free. Yeah. They wouldn't take the, take it for free and if they buy cow shit, but isn't cow shit way better because it's all grass will cow shit. I don't know. I don't know if it's better. I'm not, I'm not a shit expert. I just dabble in shit. No, I dabble in shit, you know, so much. I mean I smelled like it and I think about it a lot. But other than that I talk a lot of it.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       That's right. wow, that's crazy though. When you think about like how much shit it has to go somewhere and all the garbage when you order stuff. We, I was getting ready for uh, for burning man this year and I went to target to buy pillows and I bought pillows, brand new pillows for $4 and I was just like, this is great. And tossed the pillow fresh pillows and then uh, my wife was like, the fact that there are $4 pillows is systemically connected to societies collapse on some level. Like there's no way to make a $4 pillow and not have the earth like suffering at some point. Just how do you do that and all the garbage and I can go to burning man and sleep on it for a week and be like, this is dusty. Toss it into a landfill. Where is this stuff going? Isn't the argument that target pLaces like tarGet and walmart especially are subsidized? oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, they definitely are, but in one way, shape or form, right? To welfare or through food stamps or through actually not welfare. Right? They have to certain wage to. You mean to. Yeah. In order to support like w how much you have to qualify for welfare. Oh, I think you. I grew up on welfare. Actually need to know. Did you really do you like that about yourself? I find a great of pride in this.

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       Said it. I just blurted it out. They're like, yeah, me too, bro. I do feel like connective. I get almost nothing makes me more angry than a person Who's never interacted with real poor people. Talking about the lazy people on welfare. Right. Well, I was very fortunate that my mom, although we were on welfare, she worked too and got to a point where she didn't have to be on welfare anymore and then she got off. Same with me. So it made me realize like, oh, like this, this actually can work, can help, same here, that are super poor. We had food stamps, the whole deal and my thing has always been, when it comes to welfare, look, wouldn't you rather allow a person to take advantage of the system so that some percentage of those people can write, can raise through the ranks and get off of welfare and, and better themselves and better their lives.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       Wouldn't you rather have that system in place? Then the system that says, sorry, we're worried about people taking advantage of the systeM so everybody including the good people can go fuck themselves. Which society do you want to live in? Yes. There's certainly the former. And you know, I think with, uh, with my mom's situation, it was also important to send the messaGe that it gives a woman an option to get away from an abusive man. Yeah. My mom left, my dad and My stepdad didn't have any money and they weren't married at the time. They were boyfriend and girlfriend and he was a student and they, you know, we got on welfare and we ate, you know, we drink powdered milk and the whole deal, but it's very similar situation. Very similar. My mom left my dad when I was one and came out here.

Speaker 1:          00:51:53       She's a disabled wOman. It's like everything was stacked against her and uh, you know, so we were raised on food stamps and welfare jews on welfare. Very rare. Very rare. It's, it, it, it, it definitely. If you have a society that's a caring society, it's, it certainly serves its function. What people are worried about is the same thing you're worried about when they're talking about free housing. I was just gonna say we can bring it all the way back. Yeah. You're worried about people that come along that juke the system that don't want to work, that are lazy. who cares? Yeah. Let them. Duke wouldn't you? I mean, I just, I would rather help people that need the help and allow someone to juke the system than I would live in a stark society that says, I'm sorry we don't help people here because we're worried that somebody might steal 100 percent and you know, there's a real issue that's coming up right now with artificial intelligence and automation that's gonna remove millions and millions of jobs just by virtue of automated cars are done.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       And so people were talking very seriously about universal basic income is either inevitable. There are two inevitabilities, either universal basic income will come and take the place of the income that was stripped away, not because anybody did anything wrong, but because they did everything right and the eventual automated reality is that there aren't jobs from people. There's job for you and me, but there's not a job for a skilled journeymen worker because there's a fucking machine that can work 24 hours a truck driver. Oh yeah. A truck drivers are there first. They're the shock troops. That's why this whole thing with trump saving coal jobs, it's like, I hate to say it, but like coal jobs

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       don't matter, you know, and in the long, and I know it's like, it's like this hollywood, like comedian juggler look cool jobs don't matter and I know if you're a coal miner listening to this, the coal job matters to you more than anything else, right? You know how Few coal jobs are. It's very few, very few. There's like $75,000 overall coal jobs and there's some insane like new energy, like there's a half a million new energy jobs just in California alone. Exactly. Yeah. And so everybody kind of made those numbers up, but it's big and everybody paid. Everybody focuses on the human being. Does every, they focus on the, on the day to day, they focus on the sun going up and down. They don't focus on the year going by, right? It's like you go, oh, but my job is gone. I want my job back.

Speaker 5:          00:54:07       But it's like your job doesn't matter. Yeah. entire coal industry employs fewer people. That arby's, holy shit. Imagine if he was talking about arby's though, but I think what he's doing is sort of like this giant pro business push transparent. It's so transparent. It's, it's obvious. It's just about Making a lot of people that he knows money and allowing a bunch of people that have lost money that have probably in some way or shape or form contributed to him. Yeah. And also he's not an idiot. I mean it might be, but he also won the election by about the amount of people that work for me. It's definitely not an idiot. She's probably got some kind of high iq that is overshadowed by a severe personality disorder. Yeah. And what do you think that is? Like narcissistic. Yeah. I just think he's. There's something wrong with him. No doubt about that. For sure. There's something wrong with them. Don't you think that in order for someone to put their name up on everything like that. Like I was in New York this past weekend and we drove by this like trump research, a rehabilitation center, trump rehabilitation center. It was like this real shitty old building. Yeah. What they do is they put a, they put a, a crack rock in front of you and it, and they say, which one do you want to grab?

Speaker 5:          00:55:21       Just keep diverting you do the pussy. And then further down the line it was trump links were driving on this road and it said trump links golf course. So it was golf. I know about the trunks. Trump steaks, steaks. Like, oh, have you never seen this commercial? It's really funny. The trumps state commercial is like, oh, you just gotta you gotta love it. It's so beautiful. Really. You can you. Can you play video on here? uh, is it illegal or something? I think we'll put it for us. Yeah, we'll play the volume that whenever we play a video, the real issue with us, it seems to be, um, animal attack videos because those get so many hits that somebody owns them and claims them. And then you get pulled off of facebook. I got off of youtube, we get flagged. Trump steaks is like hilarious.

Speaker 5:          00:56:04       I mean, look, trump's not a fool. Trump is a, well, he is a fool, but he's not stupid. And the trump steaks, the world's greatest days. Give me some volume young jamie. When it comes to great steak, it just raised the stakes at the sharper image is one of my favorite stores with fantastic products of all kinds. That's why I'm thrilled they agree with me. Trump steaks of the world's greatest stakes, and I mean that in every sense of the word. And the sharper image is the only store where you can buy them. My are by far the best tasting, most flavorful beef you've ever had, truly in a league of their own trump steaks or fivestar gourmet quality that belong in a very, very select category of restaurant and our certified angus beef prime. There's nothing better than that of all of the beef produced in America.

Speaker 5:          00:56:58       Less than one percent qualifies for that category. It's the best of the best until now. You can only enjoy steaks of this quality in one of my resort restaurants where america's finest steakhouses, but now that's changed today through the shop image. You cAn enjoy the world's greatest stakes in your own home with family, friends, anytime trump steaks or rage to perfection. Provide the ultimate and tenderness and flavor. He absolutely loved trump steaks. Treat yourself to the very, very best life has to offer and as a gift, trump steaks are the best you can give one bite and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about and believe me, I understand steaks. My favorite food and these are the best because it was kind of endearing when she was just a businessman. So call that wacky businessman guy. Here he is. It's the trump guy. It's like there's a guy in India, they used to dress all in cold. I know the guy you're talking about. It's kind of something funny about it. He's a character. What's the trump guy? Puts his name on everything and but then he become president in that. What made you kind of cute? Is it terrifying with? Yeah, I mean that's the president state guys talking about sticks in the exact same way that he's talking about governmental policy. how the fuck, the sharper image they sell back massagers oh, they sell them the best steaks in the world. If there's no place,

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       I would rather get my meat and then the sharper image I go to brookstone or sharper image.

Speaker 5:          00:58:30       That's my butcher donnelly that whoever wrote that, like that's in need of a second draft, so is a terrible why it's so good. I would eat. I would push back and say, donald trump's not a big second draft guy. He's just like, uh, I'm going to say I'm really good and know a lot about it and let's do this. He's right up there with l ron hubbard. When it comes to second drafts, did you

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       you watch the choice on frontline during the election? No. It was this amazing documentary about hillary clinton and Donald Trump and it shows you exactly who they are and why they are the way that they are. Hillary clinton, who cares at this point, but trump is so interesting. Like basically he was raised with a father that was extremely harsh, not loving it all, and he found this father figure, this guy ray cohn, who was this like an extremely aggressive lawyer in new, who was

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       a big in the mccarthy erA. He was a prosecutor in the mccarthy communism trials and cones. Whole strategy and philosophy was when someone hits you, you hit them back on a level that's so disproportionately out of control that they forget about the thing that you are even talking about. so the example of, uh, how he got sued for racial discrimination is getting sued for racial discrimination. That's a bad thing. Remember that. And he sued the people that Were suing him for $25,000,000 in 1970. So it's like now the story is, oh, a $25,000,000 suit, donald trump's suing some poor kid for $25 million. No one's talking about the original thing anymore. They're only looking at this flashy, insane pt barnum level lawsuit. The racial discrimination thing was in regards to housing, right? Yeah. That basIcally there was a, they were setting up the systems where black people and latinos wouldn't get, wouldn't be allowed into trump housing through like weird coded language or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       Well, he's definitely a very litigious guy. Oh yeah. which is fascinating that this woman who is suing him for sexual harassing or groping or what is she? What is exact? It's a gloria allred thing. Oh, I don't know the suit that you're talking about, are they still going? No, this is the thing. He just claimed immunity because he's the president. Like this woman was suing him before she was one of the ones that sued him once he became president or once he was running, she came out like one of the last few to came out and gloria allred was behind her and everybody was, oh, see this coming, let's gloria allred's in your corner. You're like, oh, I See what's going on here. So I'm just trying to get paid. But okay. Someone's trying to get paid jump claims immunity from apprentice contestants lawsuit that somebody's trying to get paid.

Speaker 1:          01:01:03       That's a fair. I could see that argument. The other argument would be he's about to become the president, so a person who he's violated who was willing to let it go when he was just some weird guy selling steaks for the sharper image is now like, I'm not gonna let this monster become the president. Well, you could look at it that way. Um, but what is, what did he do? Like he did, but her claim that she's been pretty open about our clamp. He made a passenger. Yeah. that's really it. YeAh. So it's not, it's not really like what it can constitutes. It's not, you're not talking about something monstrous. No, I'm not talking about it. But in this case, the gloria allred thing, like, um, you know, gloria read like I was a woman and uh, something was going down like that where I wanted to get paid.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       That's who I'd go to. Like that's her thing. She, there was some, some article written about how many cases of hers actually go to trial and how many get settled and it's just, she's a settlement person. You ever been sued now you, yeah. Clothes. What about, uh, a lIne in my book and uh, and it is, you realize immediately that it was a stupid line and one that if I had, had, had hindsight, I just never would have put it in and the person right to be upset and uh, but then you realize very quickly that this is poker, we're just playing poker, like it costs so much money for you to go to trial and defend yourself if you, even if you felt like you did nothing wrong, which in this cAse, you know, I probably wouldn't have even made that claim. I mean, the thing about writing a memoir is it's all like these wisps of memory, you know, and you're just like grabbing stuff and throwing it in and like you have to.

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       It's almost like you have to write the first one in order to realize like, oh, here are the responsible ways to do this. You can't just like grab memories thinking that all of your memories belong to you because other people are in them. You know what I'm saying? So anyway, basically it's like if you could defend yourself, maybe you have a defense will cost you $200,000 or you could settle. That's what I no longer buy this idea that like if you settled, that's an implication of guilt. That's, that's coMplete bullshit. Anybody thAt's been sued is realizing the reality that like you could fight for your honor and it'll cost you double the amount for you to just say here's some money, but I know a bunch of people that have been sued and settled when they were absolutely 100 percent innocent and they actually passed a rule at the ufc.

Speaker 1:          01:03:26       Were you not allowed to take pictures choking people because of it? Because people would ask, okay, chuck liddell come choke me. Take a picture. You put me in a rear naked choke hold. Both chocolate dell and matt hugheS were sued. Chocolate dell wound up settling and he absolutely didn't do anything wrong, but this guy had a picture of him getting choked and he says, look, this guy hurt me. He'S a killer. You hurt me. Here's the picture. Oh, pretty cut and dry here. And the other one was mad. He was the same thing. This guy wanted matt. He was choking him so mad he was choked him and this guy wound up suing them. Then they do an investigation on the guy and like they go into it and they find out that this guy is a corrupt cop. So the guy winds up going to jail for being a corrupt cop.

Speaker 1:          01:04:04       Hilarious. He started this whole cascade that eventually wound up with him being in jail. Yeah, I mean people are. LiTigiousness is, is, is a monster of our age. But it works. Yeah, it works really well. I mean a company that I'm part of, I got sued recently, some weird funky patent lawsuit and like, oh, what do we do here? And it was one of those things where you, if you settle you, you get this amount, you know, you give them this amount. If you go to trial, it's going to cost you in legal fees three times that even if you win, what's chocolate l supposed to do it. Okay. Chuck, you could, you could defend yourself and maybe when you could spend $250,000 and maybe when even though you're right, or you could write this check for $20,000 and never think about it again. It's like I get that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       What's weird about trump being so litigious is that the republicans were the ones that made it almost impossible to sue people. That's their whole thing. Do you saw that hot coffee documentary? Yes. So fucking good. Right? And that was a republican talking point. It's like we have to start with tort reform, tort reform, and then all of a sudden there were all these like, you know, meaningless and frivolous lawsuits. That's a bIg talking point in the glp and all of a sudden now trump is like the most suing this mother fucker that's ever, ever touched anything. Would you hear him talk about it during the, during the, uh, run for president? He was talking about

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       people writing things about you that aren't true, and we're going to change the laws. We're going to change the law so we can go after those people. it's harvey firestone or trump. They're doing right now. Uh, that was trump. no, I was not good now. Hover fire thing that maybe that was too deep of a cut. I was trying to. I don't know. Nobody wanted that would be more like, here you go. I just don't know. A good trump says I can't make that speaks to your spirit. Does it? That you can't find that. Do Mike Tyson? You're good at tyson. I don't do it. I'm pretty good. Oh, that's difficult. I got, I got stephen hawking and I got the movie phone guy. Those are the two. That's it. That's how I got. Welcome to a movie phone. People don't even know what movie phone isn't you?

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       I know. There's no point that. Yeah. What about one of my impressions is defunct. Goes up. Hello and welcome to movie phone brought to you by one. Oh, six point one. and kmel jams. If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see. Press one now. Yeah. They used to be the thing. That's where the movies are played and what the times were. Phones used to be so connected to the Internet. You ever studied hacking? You know, it's like all of the original hackers like these, like really like phone. Yeah, the phone freaks do what they were doing was like not even interesting anyMore. Like captain crunch, you know about that guy. He's an interesting dude. I knew that dude really when I was a little boy explain who he is. Oh, so captain crunch is one of the first phone freak hackers and the thing that he did is he found a whistle and a captain crunch box and he found that it had the tonality that if you play it into the phone, like whatever the tones that the phone was hearing were similar to the dial tones that would connect people to long distance so he could get free long distance.

Speaker 2:          01:06:55       Now kids, this is when long distance cost money. So he was one of the first dudes that was doing that. He's a legend. So I met him when I was a big raver when I was a kid. I was Like big time. Like I spent most of my teenage years in san francisco raves and so I started going to have 16 and captain crunch was like 70 and he was at every rave, I mean every single rave. And he was 70. He was old and it was funny because. And he was just doing ecstasy and partying big time. No teeth in front of the speakers, like speaker freak like you now. He was a phone freak, then it became a speaker free. So he's blown his ears out, just like sitting there full of fear, like no teeth, little shorts. And I was like 16.

Speaker 2:          01:07:38       And who he is, there he is. Yeah, he said to me, uh, it looks very good. Guy does a lot of ecstasy. oh yeah, he's done it all. So that dude was like, do you want to, do you need a job to me because I was a cute young young boy. You want to fuck anything? I don't know if you wanted to fuck me. I've been sued before so I have no opinion on that. But I do know that. He said, I do know that he. I was like, hell yeah, I want a job, and he's like, great. It starts with a body work session that my house in mill valley and I was like, eh, I'm good. I'm good crunch. Who has to deliver the bodywork? He's the guy. I mean, basically it starts with a body work session. You ever had a job like that? You meet a metal rake. Jobs.

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       There are 70 year old man. You made it a rave. They do a bodywork. No, that's legit. What are you going on about how weird? That was a hard pass. Hard pass. How many people said yes to that? I guess that's one of those pitches, you know? Yeah, we'll try it enough time. Throw it at 100 people and every now and then it's like,

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       oh, I'm sure he's thinking a baseball metaphor. Yeah. I wonder. That's how weird fucking choice. I was very interesting to me. Thank god. I was like aware enough that it was very transparent. Maybe if he'd, you know, when you're young, sometimes things that are very transparent or not transparent at all you like,

Speaker 5:          01:08:53       oh, okay. I guess I'll do that. no, I almost got a. When I was maybe seven or eight, probably eight. I almost got scooped up by a child molester because of that. I almost did to what happened with you don't want to hear yours. I was in a library. I used to like a monster books. I was really into monsters, like dracula, guys like, hey kid, you like monster. Why was he, um, I was looking through this section, this horror section of this library. And um, this guy came up to me and he said to you, you do you like books about monsters? Just said, yeah, yeah. He goes, I've got some really good ones in my car. Do you want to see them? And I was like, okay. I was like eight. I was a total latchkey kid. My parents just opened the door just out. Why went? They worked when you get home from school and you basically were at the mercy of society and I lived in san francisco. So it's like from, I was born in New Jersey and we moved to san francisco when I was seven. Serious thing. We have a lot of parallels. interesting. I'm from oakland, you know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       I. Same thing. I was in a parking lot, accident my car in the car and my grandma went in to go shopping with my brother and this dude came to the window and was like, do you want to come with me? I'll give you a bicycle and thank god I'm jewish. Because I was like, okay, I'll take the bicycle, but I don't actually ride a bike. I need training wheels. And actually my brother needs a bike too. He liked, I swear to god. I started negotiating with the guy. I was like trying to get more bicycle for my box. And then by the time I was done talking to the guy, my grandma came out and was like, chased the guy away. So if it wasn't for these negotiation skills, that's amazing. I'd be in a sex dungeon. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:10:31       No, you were annoying. You had the guy away from me. Now that's hilarious. even a child molester, he was like, I, I, you know what, forget it. Yeah, you can keep it. I was on my way out the door with this guy and the lady who worked the counter at the library or the librarian screamed at joseph, you get away from that man. He just got out of jail. Jesus and the guy ran. He ran and I started crying and just crying and crying. The joe rogan experience could have been so different. I mean, the Guy just got out of jail. He probably did want to go back to jail again. Do those little things,

Speaker 2:          01:11:11       minutes and seconds between you and the most dastardly thing. I mean, not only that, this is 1970, whatever. It was like, good luck catching that guy like, yeah. Have you ever almost died? I don't think so. What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done? Oh, jesus. I don't know. Fight the fight and die and a drive safe or drive unsafe. Yeah. I remember I was a kid and we were always like, look, exploring places to go smoke weed. That was like when you're young, I, and maybe it's different now, now that weed's legal, but when you're young and we, it was illegal, it was like you always were like looking for these cubbies, just smoke weed. And so you'll appreciate this as a bay area guy. The, uh, somebody found this a chain link area that you could get over and get onto the, uh, the bart tracks where you would go.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       I've been in the bar tracks before because I was a graffiti writer when I was a kid and so we would sneak down there, but this was like a very narrow liquid, just a foot long walkway and we end. Somebody said that there was like a room inside of the tunnel that was between oakland and contra costa county, that there was this little, I don't know how they knew that, but like a little anti chamber. We were always like looking for anti chambers to like, there was another one that was like a sewer tunnel in oakland in rockridge that I could show somebody where it is right now, but it's basically you go down and we would bring flashlights and hairspray and lighter so that we could like torch spiders if we saw there was a little anti chamber there too and there was an anti chamber, like a little know a room inside of a tunnel, like a, like a.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       I don't know what, why it was there, but there was like this little sewer room in there that this guy fro hawk lived in and there was, he was like a black punk rocker. He lived there. He did. He had, he lived on the lawn on a lawn of like a pool folding chair down there. He slept. I slept there one night actually. But anyway, so we were always just, you not relate to that, like you're always like looking at you and your friends, like looking for a weird place to do ill explore. Yeah, exactly what to do that kinship. Yeah. So we were in there and I was like, I was kind of chubby when I was a kid, so they made me go with the back. It was like a one person, you know, walkway to get to the room in the middle of the tunnel, not the sewer tunnel, but now the bart train tunnel and we're on this little one foot walkway.

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       And um, I was aT the back of the line and we're walking towards the room and of course we will get into the tunnel and we could feel all of a sudden like the air got hot and sucked out of the tunnel and it was like, oh. And you could hear that level of like bbb, bbb beep and the train was coming and it was like, it was so close to us. I can't, my memory, I don't know if my memory is accurate, but my memory is that it was like, I mean, this as close as this mic is to me, just like food, food. And we were all like up against the wall. And then the funny part was that we all stopped and then the train stopped. I remember they pulled the, like the train stopped in the tunnel and they must have maybe they saw us or something and somehow it stopped. I

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       don't know, maybe that's not an accurate memory, but I feel like yes, the train stopped and I, I know that the people at the front of the line screamed, turn around and like run, but now all of a sudden fat moshe, young, fat moshe wiifm is at the front of the line. Right. And it's like a strip stand by me situation because I'm like chubby, like, and there's all this wind coming at me because the wind is all been pushed by the train. So I'm like trying to run from the train conductor and they're screaming all my friends like run, run, run you fat motherfucker. The worst, scariest, craziest experiences. And then the train finally pulled off and the we'd like hopped back over and like shaking. We'd like smoked weed in the just in public are like, fuck it, we don't need to go a caverns.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Me and a buddy of mine in high school hopped on the back of the tea in boston, you know, the um, public transport. It's a train essentially. It stopped and we jumped onto the tracks and climbed onto the back and wrote it. The train served on the back. I've done that. Not on the train, but on the, the uh, the buses, the ac transit buses. There was a trick where you could grab the, there used to be like a handle on the back of the bus and you put your feet on the bumper and right, like basically write it like you were like a illegal immigrant or something and we would just do that for fun from one if you want to take like one stop or whatever. It was so scary. It was so stupid. It's like the risk of like falling off of that thing was so dumb.

Speaker 1:          01:15:43       You were on top of it? No, we were on the back. Oh, just holding on just like, oh yeah, it's so crazy. Like standing on something and holding onto something. But it wasn't a good grip. It wasn't, you know. And if there was anything that really bumped you, not that it would on a train, but if it did, most likely I wouldn't let go. I mean, it was fun though. Being young was very fun. Stupid. Being stupid was fun. It's just amazing. When you think about how many times things like that happened, you go, oh yeah, there was that time like you asked me, did I do anything dangerous? Like, oh, let me think. And you have to go over these things. Yeah, I did a lot of stupid shit. A lot of climbing things you shouldn't have climbed. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. We'd start a fire once in a warehouse.

Speaker 1:          01:16:23       I remember once we found this chemical in a, uh, in a way somebody broke into a car and found all this chemical. I don't know what it was, but it was some like volatile flammable chemical. And there was this cement slide at the elementary school in the neighborhood that we lived in. And so we poured the chemical down the slide and lit it on fire. Just not familiar with the concept of explosives, but it was, there was a wall of flame, I don't know what it was, but it was so big that we were, I think we were on acid and, and, and we were in the after this big old wall of sliding flame, like, like the cut. We were chilling out in this place, the grassy field up above there and the cops came and they were like, we've heard reports that there's someone playing with a flame thrower.

Speaker 1:          01:17:09       I remember we laughed so much at peace ops because like, anyway, now that was a good memory. Well we were a lighting bottle rockets in this field and I'm one of the bottle rockets ignited some grass and I stomped on some of the grass but then some, it started out real small, like a laptop size fire, you know, stomped on it, but it just kept going. It was going left and right. And then you try to circle around, but then the side of it gets bigger and then you can't catch it. And then it got to the point where like, oh fuck, I can't do this. I can't, I can't stop this out, and then it's whoosh, and then it became a fire and we were like 13 and we ran and we got to the street right when we got to the street. Just dumb luck.

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       Aqap was there, we just gave it up right away. We started firing and the cop was like, get the fuck outta here. And we ran and we ran and then the firetruck came and then we assessed it. The next day we went by. We didn't go anywhere near it. We were just hoping and praying. Like to this day, my parents don't know I did it, but hoping and praying that nobody died and that, you know, we didn't go to jail so we didn't tell anybody about it. Then we went the next day and it was just, it's massive surface area of fire. Everything was black. This enormous field, like several football fields sized. Obviously it's number 13. I, uh, I remember that we were once out in, we were all on mushrooms. I don't remember this. this is all when I'm like 13, by the way. Jesus christ, that's the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:18:37       That's why I got sober, so yeah. You're a bad example though. For someone who uses drugs as well. If you do drugs and fucks your brain up because look, you're very smart. DId it. Did a lot of acid. A lot of mushrooms. Yeah. I loved it. I did. I loved it. we talked about it last time I was here at how much I fondly remember I'm psychedelics anyway. But you, you're sober because of other things. No. You know, in reality, I think we talked about this last time, but in reality it's like now that I look back, you know, especially writing that book, the book covers all of this stuff, all these wayward youth stories, all these insane. It's called catcher in the rye in case anybody wants it. I'm very proud of it, but it's like once I wrote that book I realized like I was a wild kid just like you, you know, or, or maybe wilder than when you were really young, but I was a wild kid with a lot of behavioral issues, a lot of mental health stuff going on.

Speaker 1:          01:19:29       Not like, not like chronic and systemic, but like circumstantial and I spent a lot of time thinking of myself as like an alcoholic and I don't knoW what, what if I even believe that, that I didn't even know if I believe in that label any longer. But you don't believe in the label. Well, I just talk about this afterwards. I mean basically I don't know is basically it has nothing to do. People always want to ask you that. I go, oh, I got sober. I was 15, and they go, oh, cool. Crazy. What were you doing? And it's like, then the answer is always very embarrassing. So nothing asset, pot drinking and now I realize like it's not really embarrassing

Speaker 2:          01:20:09       because the only reason it's embarrassing is because I've been like, I want to say heroin. So the people will go, oh, I acknowledged that. That's legitimate, but I didn't have that story. That's Not the truth. The truth is really the question is why did it should be, why did you get sober? And the answer probably would be because I was a juvenile delinquent and that was the way out that I found at the time. And I probably could take mushrooms now and before, but I don't know, you know. That's interesting. That's really interesting. So do you ever think about exploring it? Definitely. Yeah. I Think we did talk about this stuff. Yeah. But definitely I do. But what, what keeps you from doing that is, is it this distinction that you have where you're, you're a sober person for sure. There's that membrane. I think about that a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:20:54       It's like membrane. You're either, you're like, like you are either you are or you are not. Right. And that's part of it. Part of it is a, a, you know, a harm reductIon, best practices type of thing. It's like everything's good. You know, I know a lot of drug addicts, I know a lot of people that use drugs and have great experiences. Right. But I know a lot of people that got sober and thought, oh, I'll try again, and then they're all fucked up. right. I don't necessarily think that would be me, but I do know that, right? Uh, and one a and finally I just, yeah, I guess I worry about like, just habituated, but I mean, it hasn't affected you. It seems to have affected you in the opposite way. Yeah. You're, you're better. But everybody's different. Everybody is different. And what I, I'm not doing coke doing meth.

Speaker 2:          01:21:40       There's no argument for meth or coke maybe even see. I mean there's no argument from math period that just doesn't. It doesn't. There's not going to expand your mind. Although I guess there's an argument for adderall. Yeah. Because you want to sit down to write a script over a weekend. There is an argument to be made for. That might be a bullshit script about cleaning script, about organizing your underwear based on color. Uh, drugs are weird, man. I mean, I'm a big drug advocate. Big time. I'm not, I'm, I, I, I think that they're powerful and unnecessary and I want, I want psychedelic experiences. I've had them, but I had them. I always say like the funny part about taking mind expanding drugs when you're 12 years old is that there's very little mind upon which to expand, you know, you're like doing these things that are like rom das, ask like deep diving into the fractal pool of existential reality and there's nothing there. You're just like point it. So it's a weird experience. Like you're having these freakouts and you know, your mind is bursting open, but uh, I certainly wish I would like the experience of trying that with an adult brain. Maybe It'd be worse maybe, but I doubt it. I don't know. I mean, I think that what would drugs do, what any drug does is it alters your brain chemistry, right? And everybody's brain chemistry is different. So some people could use a cup of coffee, right? And some people it freaks them out and some people

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       could use some pot and some people just. There's a lot of people that I know that they just go into deep paranoid fits if they get involved with marijuana in any way, shape or form. Right. Whereas I kind of liked that self exploratory and examination aspect of it because I think, I think it's far too easy to be cocky as far too easy to not be introspective or that paranoid feeling. I think it just, it forces your brain to examine all these perhaps uncomfortable truths. So you're saying you'd like the paranoia aspect of it? I think it's beneficial. That's really interesting. I've never heard that before. I think it's beneficial because I think what you're paranoid of when you're paranoid the. Unless you're thinking the government spying on you and I'm like, I know a buddy who was a big time pothead and he started thinking that the, that the government was waiting outside of his house with a car and they were watching them constantly.

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       Everywhere he went and as soon as he left they would come out of the bushes, like he got a little crazy, but I think he had his own issues. Yeah. And he was also dealing with. His dad was dying and it was a lot lot going on, but that's one of the weird parts of drugs is that. And I don't think that I have this, you obviously don't, but one of the weird things about drugs, if you have latent mental illness and you get into your brain and you pour a chemical on it, it'll, it'll unlock itself, you know, get the dragon will uncoil and make itself known. I don't think that. I'm not worried about that for me, but I think that is interesting. I've seen that a lot. Like a dude's like 25 and it's like, oh, I think I'll try start trying psychedelics or weed and it just goes in there and it's like, oh, you didn't know you had that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:32       Not that they wouldn't have had that experience anyway, but it's definitely a, a incidental onset of mental illness. Yeah. There was a study they did about the correlation between marijuana and schizophrenia because a lot of people have tried to connect marijuana, schizophrenia. And what they found is essentially the numbers are stable. It's one percent, it's one percent across the board. So it's one percent that whether they're doing pot or not doing pot. And so you can make that correlation. Like this guy got into pot and look at all these examples of people who started smoking pot and became schizophrenic, but that's just humans. Yeah. There's a certain percentage of people that just will become mentally ill. That's a scary. That's the scariest thing. I have a brother who has schizophrenia and it's like the scariest thing ever. Regular kid rig, totally regular sweet person. And then all of a sudden one day It was like, are you okay?

Speaker 1:          01:25:20       And then couple of years later it's like, oh, you're, you are done. Your brain is cooked and what is, what is, what happens? Well, uh, he was in New York so I didn't see the entire uncoiling but it's basically, you know, he starts weird and gets weirder and then at a certain point you're like, oh, you're different. You're a different human being. Like you just giggling to himself, smirking weird outbursts, just scary, scary stuff. And it's like your brain turns on you and there's no. I mean it happened around when my dad died. So I sometimes I think to myself like, oh, maybe that was it. Maybe in the same way you pour weed on it, maybe if you pour, you pour trauma on it because trauma's a brain chemistry buster to 100 percent and so I think

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       that probably like popped the scab open or whatever that was in his brain, but yeah, a year later was lIke, oh, you're a different person. You don't have the same personality. You don't. It's, it just shows you how much of you is just brain chemistry and how lucky you are in the same way. You were lucky not to get, you know, kidnapped by a monster at the library. You're also lucky that the monster wasn't living inside your brain. Yeah, me too. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:26:31       there's, there's all sorts of dIfferent kinds of mental illnesses, you know, I'm sure I've got a few right. Like whether or not they're beneficial. That's the other thing. I of the, I was talking to michael irvin once the football player and he was describing to me what happens to someone's brain when they're in the womb, when the mother experiences violence, uh, the mother experiences any sort of violence or really bad neighborhoods or around traumatic situations that it, it elevates the, uh, fight or flight response in the baby. So kids come out of the womb, like pre predetermined to overreact to violent situations are dangerous situations. I definitely think I have that. That's interesting. I can, I ramp up way too quick. I calm myself and I'm, I'm very aware of it. So I, I, I control it and I'm, I know what it is, but like if something goes on, like I, I hit red line, like immediately laura goes from zero to 100 miles an hour in like a second. And that's not usually manageable.

Speaker 2:          01:27:34       Right? I mean that maybe that's a link to our earlier conversation about the patriarchy. I mean, if you can pass on incidental trauma to a child because the mom is experiencing violence. If a woman is living in the, you know, infrastructural like 20 700,000 layers deep of infrastructural oppression, then it stands to figure that a female child is born with a little bit of that trauma too, and a little bit of dna based like, um, maybe I won't fight that fight or maybe I won't be pushy or maybe I won't be allowed broad or maybe I won't, you know, argue because that's not feminine or you know what I'm saying? And so all of that in, you know, trauma, intergenerational trauma, which has been studied and proven, right, is maybe is maybe in every woman that you've ever met.

Speaker 3:          01:28:27       Oh, no doubt about it. I mean, I think all of us have some form of programming. I mean, if you ever been around a kid who has an overly oppressive dad, you know, and they're, they're, they're handicapped by it. You know, literally, like whether it's a boy or a girl, that their life is affected by this overbearing person who's constantly engaging in manipulation and control of their reality.

Speaker 2:          01:28:50       That's what you get when you, you ever had a. I'm sure you've had a friend. This is a drug addict. The most tempting thought in the world when you have a friend that's a drug addict is just like, why don't you just stop, just stop doing that. Stop it. It seems so stoppable cause it's so selfish and so like obviously the wrong thing to do and you're over here doing the right thing and such with such ease and what having my brother's mental illness, my, my younger brother, it made me realize is like you actually have the same thought when there's a mentally ill person. It's just with the, the next reality is like, oh, he really can't. It makes everything clearer, right? Like sickness, cancer, you don't say to the person stop because you're just like, oh you can't mental illness. You say stop, but then you realize you can't drug addiction, which is like kind of a mental illness. You say stop and it seems seductive to believe that they could stop and if you could really be compassionate and say, oh, he can't. That's like, you know, that's like compassionate nirvana.

Speaker 5:          01:29:46       Yeah. And you can take it to another place too. With gambling, it's really the same thing. So an emulation of human human neurochemistry, like somehow or another, a betting money on things gives you that charge that you cannot. You can't escape the grip of it. Like there's a lot of people that are really, really addicted to gambling. I've seen it. It's crazy. Which is really crazy that the government has fucking legalized gambling everywhere at gas stations. Those goddamn scratch tickets are nothing more than legalized gambling. Lottery legalized gambling. Are you. And you're not anti-gambling though. I mean, I'm for it. I'm not, by the way I want it. Yeah. I don't do it a lot, but like before I worked for the ufc, I used to bet on fights all the time. Oh really? You don't have the. You don't have the bug, the bug? No. I used to enjoy betting on pool to play pool a lot and I would gamble on pool games, but it just made it more thrilling. I never got addicted to it. But you do, you run the risk, you run the risk, you run the risk of getting caught up in it, maybe to a lesser extent than someone who has an issue. People seem to have inherent issues with it. It's like it gets you filipino woo. They love playing pool and gambling. Yeah, I shouldn't. What the filipino.

Speaker 2:          01:30:58       Okay. Thank you jo. Because now it's time for me to bring up my grand race theory. Okay. The fIlipinos,

Speaker 5:          01:31:05       filipinos are some of the best pool players in the world. Is that right? Yeah. And it all happened in a, after the war, after the war, a gis went to the Philippines and they introduced pool. Interesting. and uh, you know, it doesn't cost a lot or you need as a table. There's a lot of outdoor tables in manila and a lot of the islands, there's thousands of islands. I don't know if you've ever been. No, I never been there. I know how it does, it seems like a, a contiguous country and it just so isn't like culturally too, like from one to the next, like they like muslim extremists here and like catholics here by the way, they are like weird people too or that I get like, you know, I'm kind of in the muck of the internet sometimes, you know, and I'm kinda like trying to shake up some of these uh, uh, outright trees, you know? What do you mean? I don't know. I just like getting into it, you know, how do you get into it? I like, you know, I post and then people shit post me and that kind of like go back and post, you know, the posters. We had explained shit posting to me, oh yeah, shit. Posting with people, let's posting, you know, these

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       are the people that they, they think of themselves as the people that named trump into the white house right there. They're kind of like, they're almost like a, the people that think that the right is the new punk rock. That's who they are. They're like, they're down to like get in and they think that the disruption of society is inherently good, so they or they don't care and they just want to fuck shit up so they, you know, they'll, they're the people that like when I get an antisemitic post lobbed at me with like a big old nose and like, uh, hey jew or shut them down like the, I can't express to you how like water off my back that, like, it couldn't bother me less, you know what I mean? Like, because I just know that it's probably like an asian kid or like, you know, a black kid.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       It's like, it's not even actual antisemitism. It's like a computer person going let's just fuck with some. Like this is the, this is the attack. Like if you were going to play chess, rook to king, whatever, you know, it's less thought out than that. It's just messy and chaotic and what's the most offensive in most insane, you know, most wild crazy attack that I can make. And so, uh, there, there's a philosophy, it's a weird kind of anarchistic philosophy to it. And it started in four, chan and kind of, you know, it bubbled out to uh, uh, to uh, anonymous is an outcropping of the fortune. I wouldn't call them shit posters because they have like at least kind of a cogent philosophy, you know. But, uh, anyway, the shit posters are the people that when you tweet something sincere about how angry you are about trump, all of a sudden you see like 90 cartoons of the most offensive thing that you could possibly imagine.

Speaker 2:          01:33:32       You're like, why did these people, why are they attacking me? And it's because they like looking for people. Little whiny bitches. Like, you know, they're like, oh, we found a little tiny bits come this way. And then all of a sudden it's just a tidal wave of these things. Well, if you call them, if you say their name, that's where it gets really strange. So she wears done exactly what she's. I looked at some posts that she made recently about some magazine cover that she was on, showed up on my feet. And then I read the comments. It was like, jesus christ. Yeah, she, if she was a ship, it would be so filled with rats. You'd have to light a fire, right? It's, yeah, it is like rats and barnacles too because it's just like all of a sudden they're just like two, two, two, two, two, two.

Speaker 2:          01:34:12       Yeah. But barnacles could be on a cool ship and you get in there and there's a lot of people drinking and have a good time and barnacles on the outside. This is rats beCause it's everywhere. It's in the pantry. It's in every aspect of it. It is, it is a part of the new landscape and where we live, this digital landscape is filled with. I mean in a way. I mean I don't, I don't like them. Obviously they're not nice but. and I think decency is, is a sad, a collateral damage of the digital age, you know, it's just like everybody's in decent now. Somehow people Think that being in decent as positive and that if somebody disagrees with you politically, like it's fun and okay to just try to destroy that person emotionally. Well you're not really communicating with them in, in front of you.

Speaker 2:          01:34:55       Yeah, exactly that that is a huge aspect of being a person is looking at someone while you communicate with that, removed that there's consequences to that. Well, yeah, everything, the pr, a big problem is the other end and the d and the internet has made othering so simple and easy, you know, it's like the arcgis was watching this documentary and they were talking about, it was this really good documentary actually about, I forget the name of it, but it was about this guy who he's a black dude that confronts kkk members like one on one, you know, and he like talks to them and to them he converts them and he's like, he's d hooded like 24 clansman or whatever. And there was a story or hooded them as It were. What were, what hood there.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       There's actually an a very intense. Have you seen the documentary? No, I haven't, but I've heard of it super intense moment in the film because the whole time you're with a guy so charismatic and brilliant and interesting and you're like, wow, this guy's, this guy's righteous. Can you look it up? Sorry, I can find it. what's his name? He's really fascinating. Jamiel what's the moment? so there's a moment in the documentary where you're, you're the whole time you're in there going like, this guy's righteous and awesome. It's cool. And d hooding these people. And then he goes and speaks with these black lives matter activists who are. Oh yeah, accidental courtesy. That's right. Daryl davis and race in America. And uh, he's interesting. But then he goes and he talks to these black lives matter activists and they're so angry with him there. So not into what he's doing because they're basically like, we were In the streets fighting for black America and here you are spending your entire life talking to these racists and you've only, you've only d hooded 24 of them.

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       But it's also. So there's, there's a point that they're making. I was like, what are you even doing? What's even the point of what you're doing? But his point is I'm making micro victories and I'm converting people one person at a time. But there's a bigger conversation which is really interesting. Which is that the person that is closest to you ideologically is more offensive to you when they don't do what you want them to. Then the person that's furthest away. In other words, when a person calls me ju online, some dude in the Philippines with like an anime avatar and he puts like antisemitic stuff. I give a fuck about that. That's not real. That's not real to me. But when a person who lIke seems like they should get it, who seems like they should know that better says some weird antisemitic shit or talks about like, you know how cushner is connected.

Speaker 2:          01:37:28       Like the global zionism is like, that's when it bothers me more. Does that make sense? yeah. No it does. It does. Because you think they should know better and they're ruining the cost because they're connected to your idea. Exactly. So at any rate, there's a story in there where he talks about a talking to this person who's like a. He lived in an all white town except one of the klansmen that was d hood. It talks about he lived in this all white town and he was raised very racist and that black people were the worst and there was one black family like the johnson's or whatever, and his father told him, all black people are the worst of the monkeys. They're the worst except the johnsons. The johnsons are good. They're good people. And he had thIs realization, this tickle in his brain of like, wait, my father hates all the black people except the black family that he's met.

Speaker 2:          01:38:15       like all black people are bad except the one group that he's actually met. And that is like the phenomenon of othering, right? It's like, oh, black people are bad. Muslims are bad. But actually my friend tom, the muslim, he's nice but muslims wanna kill me. But the tom over here, he's a good dude. Hmm. Anyway, I think othering is like the big one of the big problems that we have. Well, it's also, I think what's going on with black lives matter. One of the things that's going on is that they're in the middle of the battle right in the middle of the battle. Everyday. YOu wake up prime for battle getting online, you're active, you're, you're, you're, you're activating your membership, you're, you know, organizing, doing whatever. and then this guy comes along and he's doing something totally different. He's out there talking to the klansmen.

Speaker 2:          01:39:01       You'll fuck those people, man. Doing right. Totally. Yeah. I was for my show that, uh, that I'm doing my comedy central show. We're doing like we just did a cultural appropriation episode and I was studying, so I was studying. I was like deep in the cultural appropriation of the reading. So much shit about it. But one of the more interesting things that said about black lives matter, it's kind of connected to this is that one thing that happens with cultural appropriation and things in general is that people seize on language. We're in like a crazy language war right now, right? Like so many of the phrases that we use, uh, are so charged with secondary and tertiary, meaning that we can't, they don't even mean anything anymore. Like white privilege is a concept that the moment you bring it up, there's so many I levels of eye roll that it's like, I don't even think it's a useful phrase anymore because it's like the moment you say white privilege than a person, the white person who you're saying it's privileged just going like fuck you, and the minute someone saying fuck you, your conversation has ended.

Speaker 2:          01:39:56       So the thIng they said about black lives matter was also a lot of silly. People use that expression. No doubt. That's the weird baggage that it has. Like it's good. The thing that we learned about that I learned about cultural appropriation because for me, I. I roll my eyes so deeply. The concept of cultural appropriation, right? It's like, oh, so I shouldn't eat burritos anymore. Is that what you're also. I always think I'm always really tickled with the idea of like the person saying, oh, you shouldn't wear that tribal gear, and then it's like go to the third world country where the market is and tell them like impoverished a merchant like, oh, I'm sorry I can't buy this bit of silk from you because it's racist for me to wear it. That person's like, please, please buy it and wear it. Like, or you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2:          01:40:38       Or like the family that's like, oh, it would be a great honor if you would, where the sorry or whatever. So it's a big eye-roll except then you start to think like upon reading it it's like, oh, the thing is it's not incidental, it's emotional. It's like deeper than, than just like trying to parse out the logic and go, oh well I found an example where your thing falls apart. It's like it's emotional. There's an emotional reaction. Like when, when somebody you know affects, you know, dreads up their hair even though you can say, but people have been dreading their hair in other cultures for a million years. Vikings had dreads and that is true. It doesn't matter because the person that's in front of you, that's a black person that's going, I have pain when I'm. I have this pain that I'm looking at, you know, a person that's affecting my culture without any of the negative parts. Right, so you can, you can wear the hair and you can have the.

Speaker 3:          01:41:31       why is that okay? Just because of the word culture, because if that's the case with someone else, some someone else wearing something that you might find a failure. What if you're a person that's extremely a conservative when it comes to dress and you see a woman in a short skirt and you have pain, should that impose upon that woman's ability to wear that skirt?

Speaker 2:          01:41:48       No, definitely, and I'm not making a case that anybody's pain ought to be automatically adopted as like a behavioral standard. Right? That's not really. What I, I learned from this whole discussion is it's like it's not really about going. No one is really saying except the most emotionally kind of a inferior, like the person that doesn't have the language to express what they're really saying. Almost no one that I read when I was reading these real like intellectuals and their concepts of cultural appropriation is saying white people should stop doing this stuff altogether. Almost no one. I didn't find one left wing woke article that said white people should stop adopting the culture of other, of people of color. Right? I read a lot of right wing think pieces that were saying this is absurd. Why are you telling us to stop adopting these cultures?

Speaker 2:          01:42:42       Isn't all culture a melting pot and all cultural borrowing, but not once did I read somebody's saying white people stopped this altogether, but what did you read? so, so mostly, and I hope I can articulate this well because I'm not the best advocate for this position because like I said, it's, it's, it's one that I struggle with that's dubious, dubious and difficult. And, and there are ridiculous parts of the cultural appropriation argument, but one thing that like, it's all connected to historical trauma. It's all deeper. Like basically, let's see if I can articulate this well, what this one, um, this one person, and I wish I could find his name actually, but uh, because he deserves it because he's a really deep thinker about this stuff was talking about was that, you know, we have racism. Racism is a, a huge word that describes everything from a white person like hugging their purse closer to their chest when a black person walks by or even like a weird, like, you know, just the smallest little racial weirdness all the way to lighting across on somebody on somebody's lawn to murdering someone.

Speaker 2:          01:43:49       LIke that's all encompassed and racism. So they started trying to like parse it out. People are going, oh, when you call someone a racist, right? They go, I'm not a racist. You're calling me a monster. And then somebody will go, oh no, I meant like a systemically racist. It's like you need more specific examples. So cultural appropriation is one, white privilege is another. There's all these, but still go back to what, what cultural appropriation. Like you said that no one was saying don't do it. Right. So what. So what are they doing when they're trying to chop someone's dreads off? Okay. I don't know about the spa. A spa. I mean, what, what example? You mean the san francisco state example where the girl attacked guy. I mean that girl was just inarticulately expressing some insanity. I don't, I don't think that's defensible. And I, and I think most of the articles in the stuff that I read about that specific instance or just like basically saying that women's, uh, an uh, a lunatic.

Speaker 2:          01:44:39       Well, I've heard people though enforce it and I know someone who was mad at their friend is a black girls matter. Her friend who was a white girl who had braids, she had like cornrows and she was mad because she was saying that it's cultural appropriate cultural appropriation. I said, do you know about bo? Derek? But like she was one of the first people to ever have cornrows on roman coins actually. Right. I mean it's, it's crazy thing to call that cultural appropriation, but also saying that a white person shouldn't wear that. That's fucking crazy because what do you. What about a black guy wearing a polo shirt? Well, okay, so, okay. There was a good example is a, and again, I'm not like, I'm not the greatest advocate for this position. I just read so much that made me empathize with the position. Not necessarily agree with it, but empathize with where it's coming from.

Speaker 2:          01:45:25       So the polo for example, when you see you as a white dude or me as a white dude, when I see somebody wearing a polo, it's just a polo. It has no historical antecedent, it has no historical baggage to it and there's no connection to systemic racism or, or elvis presley stealing the cream of the intellectual musical crop and then never giving back to that community or iggy azalea coming in, adopting a black accent and then just like taking all the money and running, you know, it has no connection to deeper root systems like these trees have the communicate with each other, like taste bitter, right? So all it is is a polo. It's just a guy wearing a polo and that's why the the counterargument doesn't make sense because it's like nobody's upset when they see a black dude and a polo shirt. I mean maybe some weird racist guy is his, but mostly not.

Speaker 2:          01:46:11       On the other hand, when a person sees a, like a, a white person affecting a deep part of black culture without any of the baggage that is associated with it. Like for example, dreads, right? One of the arguments I read a lot is that like white people wearing braids and dreads, you know, you get rewarded for it, you look cool, you look awesome and meanwhile black women are having a difficult time getting a job because they have black hair or black people getting fired from jobs because they have dreads. Right? So there's these consequences that black people experience because of black shit that white people that are adopting it don't necessarily experience think that's true at all. I, if you were working in

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       an office and some white dude at dreads, he'd be highly suspicious of his behavior. Well, for example, like is this guy's kind of like a dork? I hear what you're saying. I'm going to hire him. There's a guy that had hair like you and right next to him with some stinky white dude with them. Stinky dreads has dreads. Stink. Okay. Take dreads out. Let's say that's a good example. Would there in the us military, there was just a, a new, um, a new set of acceptable hairstyles and mo, almost every one of the unacceptable hairstyles that they, that they accept, that they put into place. It was basically black hair, like braids, wearing your hair natural. I don't know the actuaL. What do you mean? I mean, I would have to, we'd have to be like an afro. Yeah. Short afro. Yeah. I mean, you're not allowed to do that.

Speaker 5:          01:47:37       You'd have to pull up the article to give these specific examples. But basically there are a million different examples like that. And like I said, I'm not, I'm not necessarily an advocate for heat and, and honor the call of the appropriation accuser. I'm more like now realizing that, uh, I'm more now realizing that there's like just a lot of deep emotional, weird trauma underneath every, every accusation of appropriation. It's not that I think therefore white girls shouldn't wear braids. It's that I think I understand more where the person that is upset is coming from it. Just from a compassion perspective. You know, I get that. I get that. It just logically, it doesn't jive. It's not about logic. Yeah, but it should be all human interaction should have some basis in logic. If you're going to communicate with things. I don't agree because emotions aren't about logic, right?

Speaker 5:          01:48:29       But should anybody be subject to your oWn emotions like should like, you change your behavior, your dress. If you're a person who's completely not racist but you enjoy the way your hair looks and braids should you take into consideration all the people that you're going to run into and they're going to be upset at you over braids, even though they're ignorant about the history of braids and carneros, should you alter or change your behavior? Should you accept the fact that you're just going to have a certain amount of cultural appropriation? Well, let me ask you this. Like if you. I don't have an answer to that question. I don't think so. That is an important part of this. I mean, if you're going to accept the fact there's some sort of an emotional attachment to these things and that's where the argument comes from. Shouldn't you decide or at least contemplate whether or not that emotion is valid?

Speaker 5:          01:49:12       It doesn't seem to be. Seems to me there's real examples of racism and horrible things. Like if you want to, you know, make your eyes squinty and look like a japanese character from a bugs bunny cartoon in, you know, 1940 and then you want to go to a party and people think you're a racist. You should, you should be aware that you're presenting an image that is inherently racist. Like, that's, that's something that's kind of fucked up and you should be considered about the way people's emotions are going to fire up looking at your image. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, but that's a different thing than braids. Oh, but oh, but that's what I'm. I'm not advocating. First of all, I'm not advocating anything. I'm just saying I've done. I've delved into this topic enough that I started to understand where people are coming from when they, when they get activated by this stuff too, but I think a big part of it is reinforcement in the community that that's acceptable to be upset at people for corn rows or brave and I don't.

Speaker 5:          01:50:07       I actually don't disagree with you. I think you're right about that and yet I think it also is connected to like a, a legitimate emotional reality that's happening. Like for example, by the way, the logic is, is very important and I would say logic is more important than emotion when it comes to communication, but it doesn't because something is more important, doesn't negate the, the importance of the other thing. well, it certainly doesn't solve the situation just by clearly using the logic. You mIght get a certain percentage of the people that agree with you because of logic, but that's more rare than it is common, right? It's like, would you. Would You feel comfortable going to a native american powwow, you know, with a headdress on, not even a power. There's a powwow next door. You can see It and you're at a music festival.

Speaker 5:          01:50:48       Would you were an indian headdress? I wouldn't, but the reason why you can't and the reason why you shouldn't or the reason why it's an issue is because the people are marginalized. Let me tAke my own people. I'm italian and my people, for the longest time there was a lot of anti italian races. My grandfather talked to me about it, what it was like coming off the boat, but then somewhere along the line it became acceptable for italians in, in american culture where it's not. There's no real racism. It doesn't stick and cause a Guinea to our face. We will laugh. No one cares. You could make meatballs and spaghetti all day long. Nobody gives a shit. Nobody accuses you of, uh, you know, you have a pizza party. Nobody thinks it's cultural appropriation, but try having a taco party, try having taco tuesdays people get pissed to you.

Speaker 5:          01:51:33       Why? Because mexicans still experienced real racism in this country. Whereas italians largely just don't, right. and like taco tuesdays and example of something that's like, who fucking cares, that's not important. And, and so if I'm wearing a sombrero, exactly offensive to people, If that's as, that's as deep as most people go, that's dumb. What are you talking about? A kennedy to taco. I mean that's done and it is dumb, but if you kinda like get under the dme, which is the name of my, my third, my third special. So it's mouth. It's live, live in oakland now. fucking hitler and then get under the dme. But if you get under the first, like the most, the epidermal layer of like flashy insanity and go like, what's really happening here is like, oh, it's just what you're saying actually you're more woke than you than you let on june interest. It's like it's really about power dynamics. Is that really about the appropriation incident? Although on some level maybe it is. It's really about the power dynamic underneath it. Well, I think one of the things that we're seeing in universities in particular is people that are exercising the ability to affect change. Even if it doesn't make sense, they have the ability to, uh, point out something that they think is incorrect or is unjust and then they attack it and go after it and then they see and by seeing

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       those results, it's almost in a lot of ways kind of attached to the same idea. Like if you're worth x amount of dollars, why do you still chase money? Because you're trying to get the thrill of the accomplishment. There's the game that's going on and there's a certain amount of game going on trying to get that white kid that you don't even know to cut off his dreads. Whether or not you know that the romans wore dreads, whether or not, you know, the greeks wore dreads, the vikings and all these different people have them. It doesn't matter. It's like there's a little tiny white guy and that girl could yell at that white guy then chase him with a pair of scissors.

Speaker 2:          01:53:16       Yeah, exactly. It's, it's the incidence are the absurdity. But the, but the current, the conceptual current is somewhat valid. I mean, to you, I'm sorry, you know, to some degree, like even you and I think that you're naturally skeptical towards concepts like cultural appropriation because, and I am too because as, especially as comedians, it's very easy to see the absurdity and it's stupid and it's so, it's so pointless. Like what? We can't not adopt each other's cultures that won't ever happen. So, but even we go, okay, but I wouldn't wear a sombrero to a mexican club. I wouldn't walk into a club like, oh, hey, what's up? Right. So, so if you say, okay, it's almost pornography, right? I know it when I see it. right? I know when I know it's offensive when I feel it. Right. You know? So if you kind of expand further and go, okay, even the absurd examples, I kind of understood, I'm going to try to understand for me, I'm going to try to understand where people are coming from with that. Then I can kind of contextualize it now. I don't have to agree with it, but I can at least say, oh, I get where this is coming from. It's coming from historical antecedents of racism and oppression that are connected to hairstyle and, and the, and, and, uh, all of these musicians that have taken black culture and made money off of it. There's all this like deeper sedimentary layers of emotionality. I don't have to heat it and change accordingly, but I do. I would be foolish to ignore it. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:54:38       Yeah, that completely makes sense. And also I get it from a point of view of a person who comes from a culture that used to be maligned and isn't anymore. So

Speaker 2:          01:54:47       I'm from a culture that used to be maligned and then I thought wasn't anymore. And then very recently things have gotten weird again.

Speaker 3:          01:54:53       It's really easy to say that jews are responsible for a large problem. Part of the problem in the world today. I've seen it a lot lately. It used to be like reAlly inappropriate thinking and talking just 20 years ago ago,

Speaker 2:          01:55:05       it used to be very taboo and it is not anymore. And uh, it's uh, it's, it's weird. It's very weird. It's definitely, I, you know, I don't take stuff antisemitism. Antisemitism is like the closest I come to believing in magic because it's like, it's like I'm not a big mystical guy, but like antisemitism has never gone away. It just has an eye. I could see if you're an anti semite you're going. The evil of the jews is the closest I come to believing in magic because they just never stopped being evil. Like I just don't understand how this never goes away. It never goes away. It's so fucking weird. Like no matter where jews have lived, no matter how assimilated they've been, you know that the jews in berlin where the most assimilated jews in history, they, they, they didn't. They were known for having christmas trees and eating pork and that they would describe these christmas parties were only be jews because the germans wouldn't go, but it would be all of them worshiping. I mean a celebrated christmas. They were the most assimilated jews ever. And that was the epicenter of the nazi movement. Yeah. So it follows the jews and I mean, I know that, I'm sure at least one of your listeners is like, no, the jews follow it, but it's like, it's crazy. it just won't go away. It's a, it's a, it's a virus that won't ever ever die down. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:56:24       I think there's, there's a bunch of problems with this antisemitic thing going on. Um, and one of them is the accomplishments of the jews are very disproportionate, especially european jews. If you look at european jews and nobel prize winners, it's fucking staggering saying jews who were intellectuals, chess champions, a bunch of, there is a select gene pool, especially particularly european jews. Nobody talks about it that I don't think that's true. No, true. I thought it was a no. Okay. Okay. Giant people. So everyone's probably a huge hogs. Um, but do you know the story of fritz haber? Fritz harbor's one of the most shocking a jewish stories in terms of a, a, a, a jewish scientist who was a part of world war one on the side of the germans. He aLso invented the hopper method of extracting nitrogen from the environment. You know, nitrogen Is one of the most important things when it comes to fertilizer.

Speaker 3:          01:57:28       We were talking about fertilizer plans and nitrogen is 80 percent of the air we breathe. Most people think the air is oxygen and carbon dioxide. It's mostly nitrogen. And then there's some oxygen and then there's some carbon dioxide we breathe out that that plants use. Fritz harbor figured out a way to extract nitrogen from the acts of the actual oxygen from the actual air around us and take that nitrogen and use it in the soil as fertilizer. And he won a nobel prize for that. And 50 percent of the nitrogen in most people's bodies came from the harbor method like his. This is like from, you know, the early 19 hundreds of sky figured this out. It's still being used today. He also was the first guy to invent using poison gas and they use it on the allied troops in world war one. So he was wanted for crimes against humanity and simultaneously winning the nobel prize during world war one.

Speaker 3:          01:58:28       And then when the nazis took over, he, um, he created zyklon, a client a is a, um, it's, it's a gas that has a very distinct smell and I think it was a pesticide and they used a, the smell was added to it to make people acutely aware that this pesticide was being used because it was very poisonous they changed it to be, which is they use the gas, the jews. So this fucking guy created the actual gas that was used in the fucking concentration camps to kill the jews and they just took the smell out of it. That's how they created zyklon b, whatever that thing was, they added to icon a to make it smell bad. They took that out for his icon based. So it was almost odorless and they were killing people left and right with it. And he was forced out of the country.

Speaker 3:          01:59:21       I mean, it's a crazy, crazy story. I mean, when he was going to, um, the front line to help implement his gas, uh, on, on the allied troops, his wife shot herself in front of him and he left his kid behind with his dying wife to go to war. it's fucking crazy stories. Crazy. And he wound up dying seeking refuge away from Germany. He was one of the few scientists that they didn't want a few jews. They didn't lock up and he just couldn't tolerate. I mean he couldn't stand by while these other jews that he knew were going to the concentration camps and people were being rounded up and he'd go leaving. Did he know that cycle b? Yeah. I think that might have happened. Like while he was, while he was on the run. Not sure I'd have to get into that,

Speaker 2:          02:00:10       but I mean that would be a crazy realization that, I mean it's like the, you know, the t and t guy. I either built dynamite, like realizing what he'd done to the world. I mean, how about oppenheimer, right? Yeah. I mean oppenheimer is quoting the bhagavad gita. We played that on the podcast last week. Come the death destroyer of worlds. Fuck man. Speaking of billionaires, being able, I mean, to have that quote is like that's a big yikes moment. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:00:37       So I mean, I think there's. That is that jews have been so almost genetically smart for so long.

Speaker 2:          02:00:45       There's a reason for that. You know, what is it? Well, it's that basically in the whole of the dark ages, the dark ages are characterized by people being illiterate. That's they were in the dark and only the clergy could read that. The jews were a 98 percent literate people and that is literally the reason if you want to talk, it actually comes all the way back to systemic oppression. Right? In the same way that there are barriers, you know, if you're deaf or if you're black or if you're a woman, there are barriers you have to jump past if you are given an advantage. I mean, it's all evolution, right? Then you're going to leap forward, and so when you have a history of 500 years where no one in europe reads, except for the jews and the clergy, well, no shit, they ended up, you know, being at the front lines of, you know, uh, of nobel prize winning and science and intellectual ism, not because they're obviously, but because they just were reading that whole time.

Speaker 2:          02:01:42       And there'S a reason for the idea of jewish greek too, is that, you know, about this is, is that, you know, jesus said somethinG about usury. Basically, catholics were not okay with a lending money at interest, at an interest rate that was against the rules, right? And, uh, so you're not going to lend people money for no interest. That's just not how it works. And then there were some people that weren't subject to the rules of christian anti usury laws and those were the jews. And so the jews would lend you money at an interest rate. But who do you hate more than anybody on earth? Who is the person you wish you were dead? Your creditor. You're the banker that is going to foreclose on your home and is going to. Now I'm not saying that's good or bad. I also hate the banker, but that's just historically speaking, when they called jews moneylenders, it's not because jews are like, oh, I'm pernicious and I want to fill this gap.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       It's that nobody else in society would lend people money. And so not only were they the creditors that people hate it, but they were also the financier's that made the possibility of european, you know, greatness occur because without capital, without funds, you can't build a society. So, uh, that is one of the many reasons that people have come to hate the jews, is that they lent them the money and that they needed. And then when it was time to come collecting, they'd be like, fuck this dude. So fascinating. We could find the root of certain prejudices. Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. That's a good one. Those, those two are very good ones. Especially the one about being literate. I mean, absolutely. That makes sense. I mean that it wasn't until I was like the 14 hundreds with martin luther that they distorted translating the bible into a phonetic alphabet where people could read it and means stop and think about that.

Speaker 2:          02:03:27       It's crazy. It is what happened with martin luther, the reformation and the printing press with martin luther is the was the cracking of the old guard of of society and finally made demo democratization of knowledge available to everybody and you know that everybody was at a disadvantage of historical disadvantage and the same thing as you can see that truth in other systems. That's a system of oppression to. Yeah, sure. That's a systemic oppression where the clergy wanted to keep information from the people so that they could keep them stupid and keep them under foot. Yeah, and those people. There was a patriarchy there too, except that the patriarch was god or papa the pope. It was really the clergy more than it was god. God wasn't really enforcing these laws, but the literal patriarch pope. That was one of the most problematic things about martin luther apparently was that he was telling people, you're allowed to interpret what this means. You don't have to accept anybody else's interpretation because they're just men as well. Right? Those are just human beings interpretation, interpreting the word of god, so if you interpret it to be a different thing, you're allowed to do that. And they were like, what in the fuck is this saying? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       I mean think about how seductive that must've been for the church. Like, oh, we can just keep the information from everybody and just tell them anything we want. We'll bAck then also the. The pope had women. The pope was allowed to fuck all the clergy. Fuck they were rockstars. They weren't what we think of now as these creepy dudes molest children, right? No, they were fucking. There were. These were people that had armies. I mean they called upon the pope when gang is con was conquering, like going over the steps and conquering Russia. They were calling upon the pope and though the army of rome, I mean that's literally where he had power. It's very strange when you look at how that's changed and now it's become this weird cabal of odd older gay men, you think, what do you think of that's about by the way, thank you.

Speaker 5:          02:05:25       Take people's ability to have sex away and the only people that are going to stay are the people that are creepy and sexually repressed and there's a few that hang in there and they say, well, you know, maybe I can just go without sex and they get weirded out and then sex becomes this horrible taboo thing and of course when sex becomes a horrible taboo thing, then people gravitate towards sex. She'd take the ability of people to have sex away from people. They want to have sex more than they want anything in life, right? It's like a or or is the opposite? True? Is it that people are. Predators are attracted to a system that is shrouded in privacy and no sex and they can, you know, they can. I gueSs the question is like, do you go in there trying to be holy or trying to get away from your sexuality that then bursts out in this abberant way or are you an absolute monster that goes into the clergy to prey on people, but once it's been established, maybe both, but once it's been established, that becomes part of the issue because when you're, you're also indoctrinating young children that do get molested by the priest.

Speaker 5:          02:06:26       If you have some altar boys and these priests molesting these kids and they stay in the system, the odds of them turning into molesters themselves or it's extremely high. Right? What do you think, uh, why do you think people molest children? Boy, I think there's probably a whole host of reasons for that psychological reasons, but I think that a big part of it was being molested themselves. There's some enormous percentage of people who have been molested, who turned to become the very thing that victimized them. It's almost like they want to get back at someone and best way to do the attack, the innocent. It's the only way you can impart that same har crazy. It's insane. It's also like a kind of weird dark magic. It's like, why are, why are there a certain percentage of human beings that do that? Kind of the weirdest, most abhorrent thing. Do you hear the, um, there's a really interesting radiolab, I think episode that's basically about these kids, this kid who realized that he was a pedophile, like he, that's what he wanted and he realized he'd never offended. Is that a reason why it's a few years old, but he realized he'd never, he had never offended.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       And so he went to his mother and was like, there's something wrong with me, like I'm a pedophile or whatever. It's like a teenager. And so the mother tried to find treatment for him but nobody would treat him because it's such a deep taboo of evil that people like, I don't want to get involved in that. I don't want to treat you and then have you offended and then have it come back on me. So basically he'd never offended. He had these desires and he couldn't get help and he started this organization for other people like him that it's like a support group of pedophiles that have never offended. You can't. If you've offended you're not eligible for a membership in this group and you can help each other not, it's like pretty deep in the annals of like with a weird dark web or whatever, or I don't know where they find each other, but uh, it's pretty crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:08:25       Have you seen the, there's a, there's a whole market that's being developed where they're going to make like artificial children on like, um, like a, like a sex doll, like a child sex doll. And there's this argument that that would prevent people from becoming pederasts.

Speaker 2:          02:08:44       Wow. That is crazy. Like the ultimate iteration of teledildonics is that it cures pedophilia.

Speaker 3:          02:08:51       Well, it's the same argument they would use towards a anime, anime, pedophilia or any, any sort of, um, you know, cgi based pedophilia is that. If you could look at child porn, that's not real and no one's a victim of it and your lock yourself in your room, you could alleviate your desire to have this thing, but maybe that's true. Problem with that is man, there's a real argument that that's feeding your desire to do that because that's what happens with men when it comes to regular pornography.

Speaker 2:          02:09:20       just what I was going to say, that would only hold true if it wasn't for the fact that you. If you didn't see something important to go, I got to try that.

Speaker 3:          02:09:27       I think the problem is we're looking for a solution like, you know, oh, there's a fire, throw water on it. There's no like when it comes to people and thinking especially like sexual things and behavioral things, like a dictum things. people are messy.

Speaker 2:          02:09:41       Yeah. There's a crazy ted talk. I think it's a ted talk out there. This woman who's worked with teenage sex offenders like her whole career and she basically says that we think of that. It's at least with teenage sex offenders, which is like pedophilia, teenage on younger pedophilia. The cure and recidivism rate is, it's extremely treatable, right? Like it's very, very treatable, but we look at that phenomenon as you. Once you are that you are that forever and you will always re-offend and there's no hope and no going back from it and it's not statistically that doesn't hold water and her point is basically like, it is easier for us to think of these people as monsters than to think of them as sick. People that could get better if we can just say like throw them away. They'll never be better

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       than we can kind of synthesize it into our brain. But in reality these are messy. Like you said,

Speaker 3:          02:10:40       even bring that up. What you just said. You're a sympathizer, right? You know that these people are monsters and I think the idea is that, you know, we were talking about spectrums like there, like say if you get a 100,000 people, right, what, how many of those hundred thousand people feel like they were born into the wrong sex? You know how many, how many of those 100,000 people have some bizarre sexual attraction to body parts or to a underage people or to older people, you know, vulnerable people. There'S, there's a bunch and what causes those things, but there's a host of different reasons, but it's so messy and so complicated for people to defend, especially to defend pedophilia in any way. It's a radioactive. Yeah. You want to kill those people. That's it. That solution is killam, killam, black and white.

Speaker 1:          02:11:28       It makes sense. Yeah. Everybody in this, in this makes every player in this story makes sense where it doesn't make sense. History. Oh, right. Because they used to have different views of. It doesn't make sense that everybody that was like, you know, he goes, socrates, plato. I mean you go through the line. They were all monSters, so it was their quote. I've never been able to verify it's real, but the. They say the persian said a woman for duty, a boy for pleasure and a melon for ecstasy.

Speaker 3:          02:11:56       Lou melon, fuck a melonite gets. They fucked him on it because it tastes good. That's ecstasy because it lived in the desert. I'm pretty sure they fucked a melon. jesus, why would you fuck a melon? It's hard on the outside. I think that would change your dick. That doeSn't seem like a good move. Unless she likes bevel the edges. That's my fourth. My fourth special. Don't fuck them. Melon melon for ccs. Oh wow. That's so strange. Yeah, I mean that's a. I mean that's what people said that have gone over to Afghanistan to write. A lot of soldiers have said that runs rampant over there. Right? And that child sexual abuse can child dolls keep pedophiles from offending? One man thinks so. He's been manufacturing them for clients for more than 10 years. Is there any images of these things?

Speaker 1:          02:12:43       Is it going to show it online? But I could show you guys if you could show us. No, thank you. You don't want to see. No, I'll see. I just want to be on record saying no thank you. Roll up to the website. That's the japanese had to translate it. Here we go. Oh boy. English. To get a tor browser. Oh boy. Okay. All right. Wow. That's weird. They're fucked up, man. You just got racist as fuck. Forget about your cultural mean the dolls. Oh, you mean the japanese. Wait, what did I do? You said they're fucked up. They are to mean the japanese. But do you mean. Oh no, I meant the judge not so silently do this, this, this. Let's turn this off. Especially as a guy with daughters. I'm not really. Yeah, that's a. I don't have daughters. Can you throw it back

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       up? Actually wrote back. That's how that's going to have a son either do any melons. MelonS up there. It's what we're looking at about 10. It looks like maybe younger even. I, uh, that was disturbing. Um, man. And the ideas that somehow or another that's going to be able to stop people from molesting kids by fucking that rubber doll or is it going to charge up their desires even further? I, yeah, that's a crazy. I don't know. I have no way. No way to. I wouldn't want to fuck a dog by the way. That's the number one argument against pornography. Pornography rather. Prostitution. Number one argument that I've ever heard against it because I feel like a grown woman, she'd be like, there's all sorts of levels of prostitution, like here's the level, here's, here's an acceptable level. A woman who likes to give massages.

Speaker 5:          02:14:21       Say if you're a woman and you're a massage therapist and you have a select group of clients and you enjoy giving those men massages, you're giving them some sort of physical pleasure with their body. You can have the same sort of deal with a bunch of people and give them sex, right? Sure. And that's all it is. It's just a in you like them. They're your friends. You hugged them, they give you some money and you're. Thank you. We'll see you next tuesday. You gonna keep your tuesday appointment. Yeah, yeah. I'll see you tuesday. The guy looks forward to tuesday, caesar on tuesday. They get together. She, you know, she gives him a backrub. She light some candles. They have sex. He gives her money. That's to me, that's a victimless crime. One hundred percent, but then you get into the idea of sex slaves. You get into the idea of indenture child sex slaves and there's actually a crazier argument.

Speaker 5:          02:15:06       I'm not crazy, but more a more even more compelling argument for the moral good of prostitution, which is that there are these prostitutes that only sleep with a severely disabled people. Yeah, and I heard this radio special on. It was very interesting. This guy, he himself was a radio producer but also had lou gehrig's disease and he said it's very similar to pedophiles. Actually. We like to think of disabled people as having no sex drive as when they became disabled. Their sex drive's were disabled as well, and the reason we like to think of it similarly, we like to think a pedophiles as monsters because that simplifies. That is it's nice for us to think of disabled people like not having horniness because they can't get laid. I mean if we're being frank, there are certain levels of disability that it's very difficult to find a partner, you know, you're, you're intense to look at or you're drooling all over yourself, but you're still just as horny as every other person.

Speaker 5:          02:15:58       So there was this radio special of the sex workers that go and they fuck or jerk-off these severely disabled people who are so they are so disabled they can't even masturbate. And it's like, I heard that and I was just like, I went from going like it. Prostitution is something I sort of agree with to like, these people are heroes. These are like miracle workers. Yeah. I mean it's not a whole lot different than massaging those people that, you know, uh, one of the key, I don't know if you've ever heard of rolfing, you've heard. so one of the best

Speaker 3:          02:16:29       therapies for injuries to recover, it breaks up fascia and it's really brutal. Deep tissue massage that doesn't feel good at all. It's a very painful,

Speaker 2:          02:16:38       a massage inside of your mouth and your nose to do that. There's like a ralph 10 and one of the 10, the 10 different treatments. And one of the 10 is the soft palate of your mouth inside of your nos inside your nose. Wow. It's real intense. Why do they do that? I don't know. Some theory. I don't know if I'm going to fucking just go on a theory and let you stick a rod up my nose. I know that it's their fingers.

Speaker 3:          02:17:01       Oh, come on. You're not even supposed to pick your nose, you know. Well, you're talking to a guy who's had nasal surgery because my nose was broken so many times. I've deviated septum surgery where they went in and they had a cut parts of my nose out that calcified. Oh jesus. They're going to this gala. Our structural integration knows work for insight. Yo, that visual. Yeah. I think that's some asshole that wants to stick their finger up. Your nose doesn't make any sense. Nasal doctors tell you not to pick your nose. Cause infections. It's very close to the bloodstream. The thIn, the skin is very thin on the inside of the nose. That's why picking your nose is dangerous because you can get infections and infection goes right to your bloodstream and straight to your brain. Yeah. Um, uh, we started. Oh, so rolfing. So like what they do is, I'm ida rolf, the woman who invented rolfing. I think that's her name.

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       No, it's really a dog from the muppets. I don't think that's off the dog. I don't think the piano player. No, it's not the same role.

Speaker 3:          02:18:03       Okay. All right, go ahead. I think the woman invented it because her son had cerebral palsy and was one of the best ways to alleviate some of his mess muscle issues was this intense form of manipulation because he'd become so bound up by his disease that she had figured out a way to loosen up the tissue so they had more range of motion. I found some great relief with that stuff, but it's ruthlessly pain.

Speaker 2:          02:18:27       Yeah. I've had some rolfing done to. It's, it's, it's nice, but it's also awful. it's great in its result. But man, it's brutal. I wanted to make one final point about that because I think I figured out how to make my cultural appropriation point. Uh, I don't want to take us back too far, but I think what we're, what we're doing is like we came to a good place with a dislike. What we're talking about. It's all about language, right? So cultural appropriation, your immediate reaction is that's absurd. And some of the examples people use is absurd, but the, the underneath the racism is just, we're talking about racial insensitivity, we're talking about being sensitive and if you try to just focus on that, then you can get to like other reality of what's happening. And the original point I wanted to make waS in this article I read about it, it said that we often get locked on these linguistic, the boat that the concept floats in on the absurd boat.

Speaker 2:          02:19:19       So like black lives matter is the ultimate example you gave. I just thought this was such a fascinating point, is like black lives matter is the name of the organization that is there to fight against police brutality and killing of black kids. Right? And people react to the words, right? So people go, what are you talking about? Black lives matter. All lives matter. Blue lives matter. And basically if you. You don't acknowledge that it's black lives matter too, which is really obvious, right? You're fighting about the words black lives matter where we haven't been talking. You've left the foundation principle behind like a long time ago, which is police brutality. No one's even talking about police brutality anymore. Now they're just talking about the language that you chose to call your group. So at any rate, I think that was the thing I was trying to say.

Speaker 3:          02:20:04       Make sense? Look, all of it makes sense. If what is going on is people are being racist, right? If someone is doing something for racial and appropriation or sex or culture and appropriation at the heart of it involves racial insensitivity, racist

Speaker 2:          02:20:20       insensitivity, but there's a difference, right? Racist. Theoretically, racist is an. Again, racism is a word that doesn't have a lot of use anymore either because you described the same phenomenon of you saying too, like your black friend. Like wow, I didn't expect you to be so articulate. You mean well, right. You mean you're trying to be polite or. I don't like black people there. They're bad. These are the same. It's the same word to describe both of those things. Right. So in sensitivity is, is not overt. An aggressive racism. Yeah, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's insensitive. It's insensitive. Racism. Like you're not being sensitive to the possibility that you're saying something offensive or just doing something boringly dump. Now I agree with you. The logic is more important than that the nap. But I think you know, the more aware we can all be about how to not be a dick. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:21:15       It's like people want to say, you know, you could never have all in the family on tv today. Could you imagine people would go crazy. Well, that's because we moved past that. I mean that's what's going on. What's going on is there's a process and one of the things is disturbing to people about trump and what's disturbing to people about this new freedom to mock jews are appointed them as the root of all evil and then it's much more open than it's been before, is that we thought we got through that and then slowly but surely the demonization of individual groups and in terms of like who are the bad guys and who are the good guys and instead having it been boiled down to activities and behaviors and individual human beings that have the problem. Not giant groups of people that believe in one god versus another god, which is what it's been historically. Right. The idea is that as time goes on and as people like my people, the italians become so integrated that you can't be racist about us anymore. It doesn't work. Right? Totally. I mean, it really doesn't work. It's one of the best examples of it.

Speaker 2:          02:22:20       Totally. It's fascinating because there's so many things that are there still and you're like, they don't have any charge or power

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       any longer. Not only that, there's so much gross behavior by italian. It just goes unchecked, you know, and I think the sopranos is probably responsible for a lot of that. I was in Italy last year and I was walking home real late at night and I saw this guy, he's got his girlfriend up against the car and he's fucking like going off on her and I'm like this little like liberal american boy, like is somebody going to call the police? And then I kind of stood there for a while longer and he's screaming in her face and then I just look for about like two or three minutes. I go, oh, this is just some italian shit. I just walked home. I like realize like, oh, there's nothing happening here. Oh yeah. They used to. That's what they used to do, you know? And they still do it over there.

Speaker 1:          02:23:06       When I was over there, my driver, we had this cab driver and this motherfucker was a cartoon. Oh, he was driving and driving like a maniac. And then he would pause. oh mama mia, look at this girl's ass. And no, Italy iS so italian. It, there are parts of how italian it is. That will boggle your mind like a dude smoking a cigarette on a vest. But with a girl sitting sideways and everything is like the most italian thing you could ever imagine. Yeah. It's, it's funny because I went there with my family and my wife was like, oh, so this is where you get your shit for like from a group of eight people. Uh, Italy is the best. Yeah. The best place, it's fun. We went to the mall fee coast. I'm all for incredible, so good. So pretty. Doesn't even look real.

Speaker 1:          02:23:52       It's, it's insane. I mean Italy is like a jewel box. It just everything. any further into it you go. The more pretty good heard. CecIly is really beautiful too. I never went on. I haven't even either. I went up to tuscany and I drove all through there and me and natasha found like this bath cities, these cities where the romans would come to bay. Then it was like, you know, every time italian city has like a town square, this had a town pool in the center of it and it was so cool and weird and there was this big old mountain like mound of sulphuric residue. This like soft white mountain gets called theosophy fossil bianco and it's just big white mountain of like soft, chalky, sulphuric residue that the, the, the like the soda water has been fallen on it for so long that it's carved these pools into it and they're like little hot tubs that you can get into on this mountain and italy's bananas.

Speaker 1:          02:24:45       Wow. We wanted to go to, um, what's the place where the volcano went off and everybody does stromboli oh, a pump, a pump a I wanted to go to, but we never got around to it. I thought that would have been fascinating to see what these people just hanging out and all of a sudden lava and ash covered everybody and they've frozen their tracks. Died. Their pumping is a wild place for sure. You know, It's um, it's also interesting to go to europe because you realize how old everything is. oh, these, this culture's been around for thousands of years here. Will brings us back to the beginning, which is the roman empire. It's just like, you look at the artifice, the residue of the all the hugest society

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       that has ever existed mean the coliseum they, they made. They killed so many animals for sport. They put certain animals out of business like they extincted some animals. Really? which ones? I don't know. They don't, they don't have them anymore, But like certain kinds of animals that they would important, important, important. They're just like, yeah, we killed them all just for sport. It's not for any other reasons. When we were in the coliseum, they were explaining where the, um, they had those elevators. It would take the animals up from the ground floor and open the floor up and then the animals would pop through and they would do battle with them, but they were talking about how they had to raise up the side of the fences because the lower levels, we're, all the rich people sat larry and they were getting jacked by lions.

Speaker 5:          02:26:09       The lions figured out how to jump up and get the people that were at the top. Fuck yeah. We needed to get some lines back to get those billionaires with their yachts and just eat them. Yeah. How much money do you have to have to put one point $5. Billion of it into a boat. So crazy. I had a friend who bought a boat for like $60,000 and he took her for one ride, crashed into the pier, put it in the garage for two years and then sold it for 20,000. So he took a $40,000 boat ride. Oh, jesus christ. Yeah. That's what they say, it's a hole in the water where you pour money into right now, but if you like to fish it. The cool thing about boats is that when you, like, if you save, you have something, you'd go out, marina del rey in, you just go out into the water.

Speaker 5:          02:26:51       You could kind of go wherever the fuck you want. Like there's no road. Right? But you can go where it's, but you know, it's all water so you can go left and right and as long as you don't hit an island you can kind of do whatever the fuck you want. Did you see that maiden voyage documentary? Was that it's about this 14 year old or 16 year old girl that sales around the world by herself. Oh yeah, I heard about that. So interesting. Who the fuck are her parents? I mean there are some northern european danish, like previous events, white people, white people that don't have poverty. That's poverty. I mentioned that call when you land, you should get some poverty. Actually that'll give you a little bit more to do with your life. Well, you gotta think that the negative aspects of certain societies do create some sort of a rebound effect from those negative aspects. No, shit. They didn't make rock and roll in Sweden. They didn't make hip hop and fucking Denmark. That's right. They didn't make all these like vaudeville and standup comedy. I mean this all came from people of oppression and that's why about yourself. Yeah. I mean thinking about like you growing up with a deaf mom being poor and all that craziness that you went through and you're a kid like that kind of all that.

Speaker 5:          02:28:01       It pushes something through. It's totally true. Yeah. I wouldn't. I wouldn't go back and have been raised. Are rich with normal parents? Not for a million dollars. No way. No, not now. Once you've already done it, but I w I wouldn't have wanted it to have been done in a different way. I like the trauma will also, you know that you made you, well a lot of people helped you, but you made yourself. Whereas if your parents were trump, you know, or your parents were the rockefellers or whatever, and they gave you this monthly stipend. No. Fuck man. Who are you then? Who is trump? He's the same. He's the same version. He started from nothing. I mean he started from $2 million from 2 million bucks from his father who was one of the richest people in upstate New York. And now who is he? Is he. What is he like when the lights are off?

Speaker 5:          02:28:47       I wish I could have a fucking a feed of trump's brain. When the lights go down, it's probably chaos. What is he thinking? Is he like, I'm killing it, or is he like, what have I done? I think there's got to be both. Yeah, he's got to be a. Well, he doesn't drink. He doesn't do drugs. Right. And I think there's got to be a part of his brain that's pushing down the what have I done? And reinforcing, doubling down on the I'm the greatest. I'm the best. I mean, that's why I kept saying about his inauguration. Numbers are so many people were there and even when they told him that it wasn't the case, he fought it. Then when he kept parenting, not just parenting to friends but doing it to the news, doing it to the press that he got the largest number of electoral college votes.

Speaker 5:          02:29:31       That's crazy. It's psychedelic narcissism. It's like it's so far out there. It starts to seem like, whoa, you're bending reality and actually is bending reality. He's done. He's done a fascinating job of just making people not know what's real anymore and no one knows what's real anymore and Syria as the ultimate example because it's unclear what Israel. They're like, no one knows what the right thing to do is. Who are we attacking and why? What are we trying to stop? You sent bombs, so the people that are fighting isis to fight those people from doing chemical warfare on their own people, but then we also were fighting isis with them and then it's just the whole thing. You're just like, I give up you ron. Paul was saying that the chemical attack doesn't make sense, so certain certain republicans are actually looking at ms dot ron paul.

Speaker 5:          02:30:18       Technically republicans more libertarian than anything, but they're looking at it and saying like this. This might not even been real. I mean, I just. I heard this great thing about how no one in Israel believes that rabin was killed by yigal amir, the jewish guy like that. They, they believe in that. Basically hearing a conspiracy theory that widely believed in a country that isn't my own made me realize how wildly desperate for conspiracy theory everyone is. Like somehow the distance where it was like, oh, it's Israel. It's not really me. Made me go like, oh, this is so interesting. Like everybody wants to believe it wasn't one hour until they were saying that the chemical attack by assad was not real. Even though assad has done gas based chemical attacks on his own people before and his father did before him. Somehow this one was like, no, no, no. This is fake. It might be fake. That's what's so crazy and mind bend day. It might be fake and yet I don't buy any conspiracy theories anymore because I know how desperate people are to believe them. Well, this was the same scenario that led obama

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       to make that speech saying that we need to go into Syria and the whole american people went fuck that because we were deep in the Iraq war, deepen the Afghanistan war, and that was when this, I think that was 2013 or 14, but trump made quotes. It's crazy that he tweeted like, what does the us have to gain for going into Syria? We should be America first and then winds up acting almost instantaneously. It happens. People keep dropping these, like you said, this bombs at trump's feet like he cares about intellectual coherence or hypocrisy. He doesn't care. He's a fucking brat trapped. He's trapped in a corner of a maze and he's going like, what the fuck do I do? Oh, I'll just do this. It's so. It's so transparent, like 35 percent approval rating. Everything is collapsing under your own weight. You have the house and the senate and you can't get anything done.

Speaker 1:          02:32:09       No one likes you. You're the worst, so what do you do? You fucking make something explode. It's just such a terrible recipe of something actually goes wrong. Oh yeah. Like Syria as a minor issue. No one died. Totally bomb. Some airfields. They ruined some. Some ground. I agree. Ruined some air ships planes. But what happens if something really goes down and that guy is. That is the figurehead, that is the difference between the roman empire and this empire is that the roman empire didn't have the power to press a button and destroy like half the countries on earth and we do. So that's the scary part. Come to the comedy store that saturday night.

Speaker 1:          02:32:55       Yeah. Let's wrap it up with depressing. I'm doing. I'm doing a show on comedy central. I should probably mention. Yeah, you briefly mentioned it earlier, but tell everybody what it is. April 18th we debut. It's called problematic. Yeah. I'm excited about it. Why do you call it problematic and why you look at hitler? Because iT's problematic. We're basically. I mean it doesn't even look like you. That's what a weird photo you don't think. I think it's. I think I look cute if you do look cute. Thank you. Well you look like you're 19 years old with your mom. Yeah, it's still have my deaf mom. I'm still running embarked trans. Um, basically it's a theme. Every week is a theme of some of the, you know, the, the undercurrents of society. We're talking, we're not talking politics. We're talking about like the, the tectonic plates underneath them, you know, so cultural appropriation, how the internet is changing our brain, the dark web, all these kind of like, you know, a lot of the fun stuff that you'd like to go to to, you know, just these big, big concept, big ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:33:47       And it's like, it's a talk show where. Oh. And the other cool thing is it's very donahue. So we'd go out into the audience and let people ask questions and get on up and say their piece. And so you do it in front of a live crowd from the live audience. And so some of it's done in the field and then you bring it back and show it to the audience. And like, so like we, this week we're, we're doing the how, the, how technology is changing us. We have this guy nick carr that wrote the shallows on and um, and it's a couple of comedians to make it fun and funny and uh, basically,

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       uh, every week as a different topic and a, and we ask a question and hopefully we get to the bottom of it. Did you come on sometimes though? I will love to. What do you want me to do? I don't know yet. What do you think you would? Yeah, I'll send you some. I'll send you all the topics and we'll figure something out. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, it's, it's, uh, it's perfect for, it's perfect for people that like this show because it's like real conversations. It's not like it's an actual. I think people are desperate for that. And I think that's, I think you, you were actually kind of ahead of the curve on the real conversation thing, but I think people are like podcasts in general are. I think it's so interesting that we are simultaneously like making technology and entertainment shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter and there's things like your show where there like two hour episodes. It's like at the same time people are driven to distraction. They're also like trying to. They're desperate to get some depth and uh, hopefully this will will find. Well it just fills a different, a different void that's a

Speaker 3:          02:35:13       available in entertainment, especially when people are driving. Like if you're driving for long periods of time, which a lot of people listen to this right now are doing, hi everybody. How you doing? Drivers tune in if you're on a plane flight and it's going to take you 14 hours, downloaded a bunch of podcasts. That stuff is the best. It's like you can just sit there and chill and it allows you to enrich your mind because you, you listen to these conversations and you feel like you're there and you, you also know this is like the thinnest sort of organization available as bare bones as it gets. This is leanne.

Speaker 2:          02:35:48       Yeah, but it's, that's the part of it's beauty. I mean that's, and that's the difference between making a show and podcasts and podcasts and it's awesome because you can find the colonel in minute 48 and you're like, oh, I found what that

Speaker 3:          02:36:00       it was about, like we've done a couple of times in this conversation, go back to things and see how they're connected, but we don't have an executive standing over our shoulder telling us to hit all the data points.

Speaker 2:          02:36:09       Right. So I hopefully, and by the way, comedy central has been, and I'm not just saying this is a company man, they've been cool about saying like, go get weird. They kind of have to know. Yes, I totally agree.

Speaker 3:          02:36:20       They're locked into the spot like, oh my god, everyone's going away. there's no one left on television. Exactly. And they have, they have south park, which is the best. And then they have [inaudible], which is a monster and they don't have much else. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:36:31       yeah. They got another period. My lovely wife. so what is that? Oh, you've never seen it. It's really funny. Is it on right now? It's on, yeah, it will be. Its third season is the summer of. I wrote and produced that show for the last few years, but it's a spinoff for more than a year. Yeah. This, it'll be third season. this, uh, I mean there's too much tv, joe. There's just is too much tv used to be when a comic had a show, it was a big deal. I know. It's crazy. A comment getting his own show is now a comic doing like a doing a comedy central presents or, or premium blend. You know, it's like the same equation and the young comics are so funny because they're like, they think they deserve a show and it's like, really? It's used to be me thinking I deserve to go to like montreal is like, I'm thinking where's my network show?

Speaker 2:          02:37:13       fuck you. That's so weird. It's weird. What a weird time man. It definitely is, but it's a weird time. But you don't podcast too, right? I do. Yeah I do. Oh I still need to come on to. I'll do it. Yeah. Uh, it's called the hound tall discussion series and it's basically what led to this a tv show on comedy central, which was that we were getting, we get one expert on and it's in front of a hound tall instead of the town hall. Yeah, yeah. The little play on words that we expect people to remember that no ill advise, bad name. I'm willing to admit that, you know, about three episodes in. I said to them, the listeners, I was like, I'm willing to change his name. I'm thinking that stupid. They all were like, no, we like it now. so don't listen to them in the first place.

Speaker 2:          02:37:51       They're the ones who are willing to listen to it with a crazy name. So we basically get an expert on and we have that person tried to give a talk in this field of expertise while comics riff over it. So it's like mystery science theater meets a ted talk kind of. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So every, every. So that's kind of what led to the tv shows that every week is a different topic and this is, every episode is a different topic. So you enjoyed doing this conversation with thing? It was fun. Yeah, it's fun. I, I'm into like, you are. I'm into like big ideas and big conversations. It's harder to have big conversations in bite size, you know, use it half, half hour, half hour. I'd like it to get to be an hour if, if, if all goes well, I'd like that to happen. Especially when you're dealing with things like cultural appropriation.

Speaker 2:          02:38:30       I know just the opposing sides, they're going to take more than 15 minutes. Exactly. It's electric, it's electric. The full tapings have been really fun and electric and then you have to squeeze them into 22 minutes. So we're going to be releasing a bunch of extended, uh, stuff lIke we had mc search on. It was really a great conversation and had mc search on to talk cultural appropriation that real so real. Did he keep it really real? I mean, this is a bit. Yeah. Mc search used to have the worst talk show in the history of the known universe and it was so bad they will play clips of it on opiod anthony and clips of him talking about where we're going to keep it real y'all. But thIs conversation I had with search was so first of all, I love search and he was.

Speaker 2:          02:39:10       So our conversation about appropriation, I used to love him. Third base. yeah, yeah, right. He's like the original guy and we were talking with like a 1981 white rapper about cultural appropriation when it's like a really cool, really awesome. Well he appropriated the whole deal. He got a black wife and the whole deal. He went, yeah, he went deep. He went to duke. He saId something so funny in this interview I was asking is it different that when white people appropriate just we were talking about it's different with black people appropriate versus when white people appropriate and he goes, he thinks for a second. He goes, well white people as a whole or the devils of society. Like I did not think you were about this. He's white. I mean, it was just so bizarre, but anyway, uh, so every week is a different topic and a smart guy.

Speaker 2:          02:40:00       I think he's a very smart guy. One of the best storytellers I've ever met. Really. You got to hear his story about how mc hammer tried to have him killed. It's one of the greatest stories. It's one of the greatest stories of all time. Is that a real. Oh, It's amazing. It's on my pop, my old podcast that I did with neil brandon, the champs, his episode, a mc searches episode. It's on there and it is one of the craziest stories you will ever hear in your life. Wow. Yeah. It's real. Mc hammer tried to have him killed. Listen. hey, listen to the story. I mean, yes, you want me to tell you the story? I can tell you a verse, a quick version. Okay. basically, he did an a song where they dissed mc hammer's mom, right? Oh, jesus. For some lyrical reason. I mean it didn't.

Speaker 2:          02:40:38       And mc hammer got angry and called the head of the crips in la to put a contract out on their life. Right? So Russell Simmons hears about it, right, and they are at third base is in a flight from New York to California and Russell Simmons hears about it and it's like, oh my god, they're gonna kill third base, right? And so he calls the head of the crips and it's like, you have to take this, uh, uh, you have to dead this, uh, this contract, please don't kill my clients or whatever. and so The guy, the head of the crips is like, I will end this hit on third base, but only if you can get me tickets to the emmys, uh, to the grammy's and sitting next to Michael Jackson and Russell Simmons is like, oh my god, okay. And then he calls Michael Jackson through some crazy series of events and somehow gets some Michael Jackson and Michael Jackson says, okay, I'll let him sit next to me if blah, blah, blah happens.

Speaker 2:          02:41:31       I don't know what it was. Some other weird twist. Bring some robot. Fuck kid does go to the future. FinaLly sees kids bringing them back. And then third base, by the way, they have no idea they're in the air. They're flying while all of this, like weird machinations are happening, they land and meeting them at the gate is a crip, a high level like lieutenant crip. Right. And he's like, stay with me. There's a contract on your life and the only way that you'll live through this trip is if you stay right next to me. So they're walking through la and these trips are coming up who haven't because it's like the crips, you know, they don't have like a structure. Right, exactly. So these trips are like roll up and the lieutenant will be like a crip crip, you know, hand sign, stand down and the crip will be like about to kill him.

Speaker 2:          02:42:17       And then would go, oh, thank god search. I'm a big fan man. Right on. Like, oh my god. Jesus christ. That's the craziest story. Mc hammer jumps the gun. Huh? A little crazy there. I mean indeed that I don't know if it's true, but I know that he told that story. Wow. Anyway, let's leave it at that. Cool. So when did your show start? April 18th. Ten pm after tosh. The monster. That's um, next. Yeah, next thursday, thursday, thursday. Next thursday is our first episode. Oh, right after [inaudible] sweet spot too. Yeah, the banking on moesha. I hope so. I'm banking on me too. Well, thanks brother. Let's do this more often. I'll do next. Yes, please, please. Thanks joe. That's awesome. Hi everybody.
