Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Is that a, is that a gun? That was a weird point. That was not. It wasn't sure if that was the gun. Chris Ryan. Hey, I'm good dude. The Van van anthropology out there, man. What do you do to events and I call her. You just traveling in that thing. I just got back from a month on the road. Yeah. Wow. To New Orleans and back. I was just New Orleans too, but it only took three hours. Yeah, I took the scenic route. How many days did it take to drive New Orleans? Uh, you know, we stopped a lot along the way, but uh, it's, I dunno, 10, 12 days or something like that. You want to stop? We actually, we went down along the border. We, we were in Bisbee a standard now. He was in Asia. He was um, you know, Southeast Asia. It, like when you think of [inaudible], you think of Stan up in extra ball at this point.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       It's not much of a reason to go to. You say you didn't visit standard. Like if she went to Phoenix and didn't visit a guy that you knew there, it's like, I'm sorry man, I got really busy. Yes, that's normal. But if you went to Brisbane, didn't visit Stan Hope. Yeah. How many people are in Brisbane? I don't know, but there are low. It's a strange little place if you've been there. No scared. It's like this giant open pit mine and like the hills are all kind of purple and weird colors because it's all slag from the mine. Really? Yeah. It's. It's a toxic looking place. I got to say. I don't know why anyone would choose to live their real estate crashes. Dr Chris Ryan Trash has been going down. I'm not saying anything that isn't pretty obvious. If you drive through town, I'm sure they're a nice parts of town.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       I don't know. We just drove through. I was. The coolest thing about this van is I've combined it with the podcast and so I'm traveling and I'm also meeting people along the way. Some of which are planned, like if Stan hope had been around and was willing to hang, definitely would've hung with them, but others just come up like, uh, right near Bisbee. See people follow me on social media and they're like, oh, I see you're in Texas. You should visit my buddy in Terlingua. And I did. And I'll tell you that starting a minute, but near, um, bisbee this woman, Dorothy, I think her name was, wrote to me and she's like, dude, you're in southern Arizona. You gotta drop in on my buddy, the rattle snake guy who's been studying rattle snakes for 50 years by himself. He's not looking for fame or anything, but I'll talk to him. I think he'd, he'd like you and you guys would enjoy each other's company. And so I'm like, sure, I'll talk to the rattle snake guy. Perfect. So he came out to this camp site and we hung out for the morning. The Sky is amazing. Uh, John Porter is his name. He's been studying snakes for 50 years. He's just totally interested in them, lives on next to nothing in a trailer in the desert.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       That's his focus has been bit 15 times. Jesus. What keeps you fucking with snakes after byte number 11? Yeah, I know. Full Bite me 10 times. Shame on me. This is bullshit. This job sucks. Like how many years has he been doing it? Fifty years. 50. He's almost 70. That's incredible. And he's in really good shape. He scrambles around in the hills and and pull snakes out of holes and. Wow. Yeah, he's a. he's a really interesting cat and he's just like, that's his passion. That's what he does. Now, did he do the slow amount of venom in his system to try to make himself immune? You can't be immune to it because what I learned from him, one of the many things I learned from him is that rattle snake venom is essentially digestive enzymes. And what what happens is they bite an animal. The animal runs off 20 feet or something before it collapses.

Speaker 3:          00:03:57       The enzymes are digesting the animal from within because they don't have enough enzymes within their own digestive tract to digest the whole thing from outside. Right? So when they get the animal inside them, they're digesting it simultaneously from outside in and then from inside out cheap. So that's why. What a monster these are, um, the snakes that, that strike a warm blooded animals. And then the ones that eat cold blooded animals, they have the neurotoxins. That's a different type of. Here's a terrifying video that I put on my instagram a couple of years ago. I think you said rattlesnake one, you'll never find it. It's like way back there. Jamie smiled. It's a call. It's a challenge. Uh, I retweet it or repost it. Somebody else's. Some guys were hunting and a rattle snake was pulling a rabbit. And just the way this demon thing just pulled this poor little fuzzy rabbit.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       But I instantly made the differentiation. I instantly differentiated which one I was on team whose team I'm on. I'm on team, fluffy, fluffy, and furry roadways. Anything that's very well, unless, unless you've got a gun or a bow in your hands, well to eat it. I think the most delicious. Oh No, no. I'm not judging it at all, but what I'm saying is it's. But if something else was going after that snake, if somebody had killed, it's like a coyote had killed a snake. I really wouldn't be bothered by it or something that bothers me for whatever weird reason. I think of a rabbit as being not just a rodent enlightened form there. I mean, I think of it being like fucking Peter cottontail or something stupid like that stuff's in your head. Herbivores. They're innocent, right? They're not out there fucking with other animals.

Speaker 3:          00:05:41       So it's kind of like very few herbivores. Sometimes they eat the birds, the birds when they can, but they're more just opportunistic. If a bird can't move, they'll eat a baby bird. Right? Yeah. What is this steak? First Rabbit? No, it's actually dragging a rabbit in the desert. It looks like we're in the mountain. This is the one where the moms saves the babies. Oh, is that what it was? That happened to me once. I'll give this to mom. Rabbit comes over. Oh, she sees what's going on. Wow. That is crazy. That is fucking crazy. No, that's not the one. This one was a rattlesnake. A big ass rattle snake. And it was dry, it was just the way it was dragging this rabbet around was so intense when I was a kid, I,

Speaker 4:          00:06:28       I used to think I was an Indian, you know, and I'd wander around the neighborhood than a loin cloth.

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       Are you allowed to do that today or would you get culturally appropriate for someone to come after you? I probably, I mean indecent exposure to because it wasn't wearing underwear. Oh you terrible person. But with going cloth made out of bath towel, herbal bath towel. So it just folded in thirds and I have a belt come up with a handgun in the front and the back. Seriously, I was totally into it. But anyway, I was wondering around the neighborhood in my Indian thing and uh, I saw this rabbit and there was a bush with these hard little fruits on it and I grabbed on these fruits and I threw it at the rabbit. I fucking hit it [inaudible] the rabbit started flopping and boom, just laid there. I was like, I just killed that fucking with a piece of fruit with a hard, like little crab apple or something. So I walk over and look at the rabbit and it's just laying there and then I hear the squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak under this pine tree. And I go and there's this nest of little baby rabbits with their eyes still closed. Little tiny ones. I just fucking killed their mother dude. I was like, oh, what a bummer.

Speaker 4:          00:07:41       I uh, so I took the babies home crying. She really did kill the mother with a crab. Apple should have been major league. He should've been playing for the dodgers. Well, chicken, I kind of pitch. So I took the babies home and the next door neighbor, my friend's mother was a nurse and I showed her and she had like a syringe without the needle and she showed me you have to mix a can't give them straight milk because the rabbit milk is thinner so you have to mix water with it and all this stuff. And I was feeding them and, and then I went back actually a little while later, maybe, I don't know, the next day or something and the, the big rabbit was gone. Which then later in life I thought maybe it wasn't dead, maybe it was faking it to try to save the babies to distract me

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       more likely coyote. It, it made me just a knockout. You knocked out the rabbit. That makes sense because if you get hit in the head with something that you don't see coming, it's very likely your branch could just shut off, right?

Speaker 4:          00:08:39       Yeah. So anyway, I raised these rabbits. I'm until, I don't know, a few weeks until their eyes opened. Wow. Yeah. And then we'll do them boil them or from. Yeah, no. Then we had to go visit my, my uncle in Ohio

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       and I left the rabbits with this girl and told her how to take care of them and all that. And uh, the girl apparently forgot about mixing the water. And so by the time I got back after a three day weekend, a couple of them had died, but she didn't want to tell me. And you know, we were 10, 11 and actually it was all through the biology teacher. And then it turned out, by the time that she told they were all dead, they all just died. They probably would have had a hard go of it anyway. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Maybe you missed your calling baseball. Baseball. So boring. It's definitely boring. It's one of those things that you couldn't. And people right now are screaming, fuck you. Your fans hate me. Anyway. Stats. No, that's definitely not true. I see it occasionally attention to those comments.

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       They're amusing. They're only the people that would comment something shitty. Yeah. They're the only ones that are going to get to you to also. There's a lot of Kuk Beta stuff, the because they assume I am in an open relationship and so therefore there's all that kind of stuff. You're that cut thing. That's interesting. Anyone who would call someone else a cook or a Beta male is most likely. I don't think you could say anyone because sometimes people just are and some people say it and they're correct, but I think been the most part. But why would you just shut that? You're not in an argument. Okay. You aren't in an argument with them, you don't know them. You guys aren't so widely insulting you. Why are they going after? It's because of insecurity. Let's also, because of this weird way of expressing each other ourselves on, on instant, you know, on twitter, facebook and stuff to instant, that instantaneous ability to just go after something.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       You don't meet them, you don't establish a friendship with them. You don't talk to them is why I'm saying it's a reflection. As a psychologist, I find it really interesting because it's an, it's, it's, you know, you see these guys every fucking day. There's another story about an anti gay, you know, minister who's been sucking little boys Dick's everyday or even big black guy, Dick, whatever is available dixies into. But if he's trying to like pray the gay away. Yeah, for sure. There's some gates going on somewhere. I think we reveal our deepest secrets in our loudest accusations. I think you're right. You know, and so this whole, the trolling and stuff going on online is interesting because people don't realize that they're exposing themselves, you know? Yeah. Well, it's also, it's a really shitty way of interacting with humans that some people participate in almost exclusively, like there's some people right now in our culture that they're communicating with people, but the people that they're communicating with, their, their only communicating with people online, they're only doing it through twitter or facebook or however they do it, so like their days are spent interacting just randomly with people tweeting at them

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       and reading tweets or reading, you know, reading message board posts or posting things or reading instagram passages. All they're doing is interacting with people online and I just think there's a lot of kids developing that way because they're not even. Even when they're around each other, they're spending more time communicating with people through a device than they are doing it face to face because they're always distracted and I feel like this is a very. It's not indicative of how we evolved like these, this method of communication. So like people say there's way more hate today than it's ever been before. I don't think so. I think it's the same amount of hate. There's just this new weird form of expression that doesn't make you take into consideration the other people's feelings. It's like the only time we've ever had something like that, like if you killed someone or you beat someone up and you looked at them and they looked at you and you knew that you hated them, at least that's an honest attack, but if you're. If you want something terrible to happen to someone and you don't even know them, he just heard him on a podcast. He was a guest and he annoyed Usi want terrible things to happen to them like you're not even. You don't even know.

Speaker 4:          00:13:03       It's like traffic, anger, you know, fuck you like that guy in that car.

Speaker 5:          00:13:09       I know where that comes from. The right traffic. Anger comes from a heightened sense of awareness because you're going so fast because you're in your car. Scared. Yeah, well, you're ramped up. You're looking constantly for anything to go wrong. You can't be at zero and just drive. When you're driving, you're very aware that you're at the wheel of a big fucking thing that had car accidents happen and people die on them. Everybody's aware of that. So you get, you get ramped up.

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       Although it's funny. I wrote a motorcycle everyday for about seven years and uh, I felt very calm on the motorcycle. I think [inaudible] freedom. It's freedom and vulnerability. Do you have both the Gemma Harley BMW. I knew it. I'm a guy. I'm not a Harley guy and some European thing. Fine, fine. Low Center of gravity. Yeah. I drove that like a grandpa too. I was like, I never got pulled over because in span I never had a Spanish audience. Really? Yeah. That's amazing because I shouldn't say that online. Probably not. It's too late now. About um, yeah. But, uh, the thing in Spanish, it's funny because if you come from, you know, Mexico, Uganda, wherever, and you immigrate to Spain and you get residency, you have to turn in your driver's license and they'll give you a Spanish license. Right. The only country where they won't honor your license is United States. Wow. You got to go to driving school, that bullshit night school for six weeks, take the ridiculous test that's designed to trick you and it's the translation into English is incomprehensible it and then you got to do it again. It's like 4,000 euros. It's a giant scam and it's only for us for America. And the reason is that all the Spanish kids were to the US doing

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       like high school exchange thing and to get it you have to be 18 to get a driver's license in Spain. But in the US 16 obviously. So they would come here and it's 16. They'd get a driver's license and then they'd go back to Spain and say, hey, give me the license. You got to do it. It's so Spain. They talked to the American government like, Hey, stop giving Spanish kids licenses. And the US is like, fuck you, we do it the way we do it. We're number one and let's face. It was like, all right, and then fucking Americans. And so now it's this giant pain in the ass if you're an American living in Spain.

Speaker 6:          00:15:23       Oh Man. So what happens if you get caught and you don't have a license? So if you're driving around, you're going to find how much?

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       A few hundred euros. That seems like a bargain. So yeah, that's what I figured they paid over 10 times in order to. I was like, what you do is pretend you're a tourist, right? Just in town. Have your passport, you know, don't have a vehicle registered in your name. Not that I would ever do any of these things.

Speaker 6:          00:15:47       Yeah. I was reading about a ex pats and about people who just decide to just like go and move over to Europe for awhile. It's totally cup. Such an adventurous thing to do if you really think about it as an American because Americans are for sure locked into our way of thinking. Like there's A. I don't want to speak for the whole group, but when you think of the typical American, you think of someone who just. They like things the way they have them here. This is the best. We're number one. Well those people are getting away from. Yeah, there's a lot. But. But the point is like if you even have an a niggling of that and then you decided to move to Italy for a year, that will go away. You will realize like, oh, okay, whatever. Form One of the. I think that's one of the reasons why people cling so hard to those norms I go because they know.

Speaker 6:          00:16:38       I think they know that Cambodia is different. And if they were living in Cambodia, they'd be living like Cambodians. They know that Laos is different. They know that Vietnam is different. How could that be? How could these people in these other places be just like you just a person, but they walk around in a rice patty all day and they pushed an ox and they don't have cell phones. Like how did that happen? Could that have happened to you? Like if you just got a weird roll the dice and instead of coming out with a seven, you came out with a three. Could you have been in Laos, if you. Unless you know, I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       and uh, from a Laotians perspective, he got the 70 and you got the three. Oh, for sure. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:17:16       Guy Take a cubicle, job is used to working outside and beautiful weather else is great. I've been there. Beautiful, beautiful country, gorgeous on video. I've never seen in real life. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:28       whole thing is just. I traveled all through my twenties and thirties was for that insight. Yeah. To see it. You got to see it and you got an impersonal right? Yeah. And you gotta move slowly enough that you had Joseph Campbell called a d tribalization to to understand that you from a tribe, right? Everybody thinks everyone else has an accent, but I don't, you know, there, there are all these biases that we're unaware of until you get out and look back at yourself and where you came from. And so I was, I was based in Spain for 25 years, so really, you know, got into Spanish. I've lived in Spain longer than I've lived in any other country. But you don't speak Spanish. Charter do for Kelly by skt says I speak, I speak badly. But you speak it. Yeah, I understand everything and I sound like I gave a talk in Argentina once and they came up after and they said, I sounded like, um, somebody said I sounded like a on Gringo because I learned Spanish in Catalonia, so I have this very specific accent in Spanish, which I'm totally unaware of.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       Of course, intellectually that makes sense to me, but my brain is like, what different Spanish acts, how the fuck could you tell? Well, it's like, obviously you can take a Spanish person who learns English in Scotland. Yeah, they sound Scottish speaking, right? Yeah, for sure. Or, or I mean how many number of people that come from other countries that speak Spanish or speak English rather, but they speak it with the accent of their place in India. Even Canadians. It's so subtle about a boat. A boat. Yeah. Yeah. I went to university and you see here a few times and they're a little bit too polite. You're like, Hey, I love fucking with Canadians. We asked them where they're from or what part of the states are you from, and they say, well, I'm from Canada. And like, yeah, yeah, whatever. Yeah, you're James Brown has a song called living in the USA and he goes through and you know how he does like he calls out cities, Pittsburgh, PA, let's live in the North America.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       So I guess that's his thing, right? Mexico, there's North America to. Isn't that crazy? I shared as North America, my first, uh, apartment in Barcelona. I shared with this guy named Roy Leo from Rohelio Gutierrez from Columbia. Got This fucking serious name and I was just learning Spanish then. And uh, he got, he got really pissed off at me when I said I was American because he's like, we're all Americans, dude. Colombia, South America. America is the whole Western Hemisphere. You arrogant fucking need interface. That's what I had to learn to say in Spanish. That means from the United States, those states one then say suited dense or united. Yeah. So I used to remember that. I just remember who stato stabbing you speak any foreign language? No, no. I took A. I took Italian in college and Spanish in high school or remembered none of it. I took three years of German in the middle school, high school because I initially signed up for Spanish, which would've been the smart move, but then over the summer I was like eighth grade I think in over the summer, uh, this girl named Judy Gumph, who I just lusted after Judy [inaudible], who she was just telling me about Judy Judy gown for the 15 year old who was totally built and gorgeous and smart and going out with a 23 year old dudes Camaro and here I am with my zits and then braces and I'm thinking I got a shot at good judy Gulf.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       So I, she was taking German and she said, oh, but there only eight people in the class. I don't know if they're going to do it because you should have nine. And I was like, Judy, I'm going to call the school and switch over to chairman. And I did sat that class for three years with hair. Flint and Judy never had a shot at judy of course. And then hair. Flint I, I could not. I have no talent for language. I'm like, I'm all right in English, but like when you start talking grammar and the accusative case and you know, in German there are three genders in, in, you know, there's deed, their das, masculine, feminine and neutral, and every noun has a gender and it's like a fucking nightmare. So as neutral for objects like Das boot. Yeah, right. Objects. But also it's weird because like a mentioned girl is neutral and you would think girl would have a fucking feminine gender neutral does, does mention.

Speaker 2:          00:22:17       But anyway, a hair flint was also the soccer coach. So we sorta had this unspoken agreement that if I was on the soccer team he would pass me in German even though I was lost constantly. I mean I would have failed out for sure, but he would give me a c as long as I was on the soccer team. Not that I was a soccer star is just that he needed enough people on the team that they'd keep paying him or they'd shut it down. So my memory of German is basically humiliation from judy gum because I never got anywhere, humiliation and the classes I couldn't understand the fucking thing and humiliation on the soccer field because not only did I suck at soccer but he would scream at me in German. So I was in the German class so it was like God, it was my tutoring or something. So like nine dm Copley. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:23:11       My Italian class in high school, there was this really friendly, beautiful Puerto Rican girl. She was beautiful. Like she was the type of girl that I would have been way too nervous to ask out a way too nervous to approach. I just wouldn't have need. I would've needed a bunch of green lights to talk to her. I'd be super nervous, but she would approach me and she's always inviting me to go places with her, her and her friends and I'm like, well what are you guys doing? Oh, we're going to camp out, we're going to do this thing. And there was this a getaway for the weekend. Like one of them I couldn't do. So I was. I was fighting back then, one of them I couldn't do because I had

Speaker 6:          00:23:46       a fight and one of them I couldn't do because I think, I don't remember what the fucking reason was, but it was. It was enough of a reason that I would say no. This hot Puerto Rican girl asked me to go somewhere with her on the weekends. Beta cook behavior show. She was so hot. She was so hot. She was built like a woman. I mean we're both. I think I was probably 19 and so she was probably 19 too. She was, she was a phenol mom. I mean her body was just holy shit. Super duper pretty and super duper friendly. So I'm thinking one day this is going to happen. Right? So I go to the lunch room one day and it was the day that it was the trump airplane. I know I've talked about this before. The trump airline, the runway gear didn't come down and it's skid.

Speaker 6:          00:24:32       Like remember when trump had an airline? Do you remember that? Vaguely, yeah. I had a fucking airline side of it and I'm pretty sure it was him or maybe it was jet blue. Now let me think about it. It might not have been trump or might have happened either way. This airplane skid and you know they had a foam up the runway, the whole deal and things skin without the gear and I showed up and was her and her friends landing gear fails on trump jet. No injuries. Okay. Nineteen 89. That is it. That's exactly when it was happening. You were in high school in 1980. That was 89. That must've been. I was 21. No, that doesn't make sense. It must have been another one. See if there was one from earlier because when I was 21 or two given up on the idea of college, they're going to say, given up on the idea of her.

Speaker 6:          00:25:22       No. I was like, what am I doing? When I was 21, I was like, this is just too ridiculous. And then I started doing standup was there was a Mexico City air disaster believes air international. Mexico City crash. No, it wasn't a crash, it was the same thing with the landing gear. Wouldn't drop down. Type in airline runway in my memory. Sucks in Boston. It wasn't Boston. Oh, there you go. I just can't imagine that I was 89. I was 21. Anyway. So what happened with a woman and yeah, no, it's definitely not 89 because I was uh, I was already doing standup by 89, so I. sorry, I sit down hundreds of thousands of people that go and just sit down to the guys here. What happened today at the airport and they'll know what happened. I go, this jet came in and the landing gear didn't drop so it had a skid across the runway. I go, but everybody's okay. And they all go, praise God. Oh, praise God. And I went, oh, that's the weekend getaway. The weekend getaway. It's an indoctrination to a Christian cult. They were bananas. They were in. They were super proselytizing. They would go everywhere and sit down with people that were by themselves. And if you saw, if they thought you were lonely or an outcast, they would send in the hot one, she would come and sit next to you and invite you places and then they'd pull you into the fold and they were just

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       recruiting people left and right to join. And then like I noticed as the class would go on, like later in the semester, I noticed some of the people from the class, we're now in that little tight group and they'd all hang together. It was very strange. It was like I was watching people get, they got cult it up that was watching it happen. But it was all like standard standard, you know, Christian stuff, but extremely involved in your life. Very rabid. And you know, and recruiting, proselytizing everywhere. And the fact that this had like, it was very strange because I was like cute dummy. Of course she doesn't like you. She wants to bring you to Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       You know, maybe if she was going to fuck you to Jesus. I didn't think so. I didn't have much confidence back then, believe it or not, I didn't think it was going to happen, you know? Does anyone have confidence at 1920? Really dumb kids.

Speaker 5:          00:27:38       Yeah, that's it. When I was 19 I was like, I couldn't, nothing made any sense. I might've been 20 when it happened.

Speaker 2:          00:27:45       Yeah, if you think you got it figured out in 19 or 20, you're destined for a life, you know, stacking shelves somewhere.

Speaker 5:          00:27:51       I can't imagine that it was in an 89. It doesn't make any sense unless my whole timeline for when I quit college is off.

Speaker 2:          00:27:58       I just finished watching. I'm binge watching this new netflix documentary about the Roger Nishi. You know, the Sunday I was in Oregon. Wild West. Wild wild country while. Well country. Yeah. It's amazing. It's really good. It's how many six episodes I think. Yeah, we just binge watched it. Um, I have a buddy who was the son Yassa and for 15 years maybe something like that. He wasn't in Oregon though. He was always in India. But yeah, that's very interesting. And the whole sort of appeal of the cult and the hunger to be part of this community. And it was a very interesting documentary. Yeah. Well I don't think it's too hot. I don't think it'd be very hard at all to start a cult. I just don't think it's very difficult. I think some people would say you already have. Well maybe, but you can do whatever you want.

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       I mean, no, no, no. Uh, no one's asking you for a. do you have. Do you have any. You need to step up your game there. He goes onto the window. Like the instead of the Rolls Royces, you got the porsches, Porsche, Porsche Gurus. I'm realizing I like old cars, old cars. You don't even have to drive as good. They don't have there a different thing. You ever heard of Mickey Avalon? Yes. I had him on my podcast recently. Really interesting and smart guy. And He, in addition to being a rapper and whatever he does, he. Simon rex is a good friend of mine, a dirt nasty. And the two of them were on tour together anyway. So I was talking with the Mickey and it turns out Mickey Restores Antique cars. Wow. And he's got like 20 of them, like, like model t's and shit. Like that's awesome. Really interesting

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       cars. They're part, man. This is what an old car. They're just, it's a different thing, you know, it's cool to see the process of them figuring out how to design cars at faster and faster. So his car. Oh God, that's beautiful. What is that 61? Impala. A Rockford fosgate equipped 61 in Pollo. I love that sort of art deco lines. Yeah. So when he's doing his, um, and I think that is a, what they would call Resto Mod. You know what they take an old. This is, that's the best of both worlds. They take an old car and they put modern brakes in modern suspension and they're just safer and they ride better. He could even swap out the engine, right? Oh yeah. They all do. The lot of them do, I should say, um, they use modern fuel injected engine. You can buy them from almost all the companies, Ford sales, crate engines and people put them in old mustangs, so it's amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:30:41       I love those old Mustang split rear windows to some of those cars are just. You look at them and you're like, God damn like, what? What? How did they do it? So good then. And why? Like you look at those old mustangs are old corvettes. Like there are a few years where corvettes just couldn't have been more beautiful. Have you ever seen my 19, 65? I don't think so too. It's to correlate his car I've ever seen in my life. I have a 1965 silver, 1965 corvette convertible. Wow. Stand. I just sit in front of it. May have seen it. Did you and Jay Leno drive around in that? Yeah. Were you in Topanga?

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       No. I remember watching that clip and thinking they're dry. Oh yeah, look at that. No, we went to the Angeles crest highway. That car is two years older than me sort of see, but sort of as the real thing, like the outside is everything in the inside as far as like dashboard and stuff is. So you've had the hip replacements and stuff. Those are joints. Yeah. This car has got any of everything in that car is modern in terms of like the breaks and the engines, engines from a 2007 corvette. They just do that then that way, like you're driving around enrolled car, but it breaks goods at handles good. It's not a death trap, but as getting back to the cult thing, uh, you know, I think some of the mechanisms, the psychological mechanisms that make that possible apply to what's happening in podcasting these days. Yes. And the beautiful thing about podcasting is so far no one has taken advantage of it and started some compound somewhere and banged everybody's wife didn't file it or we have this thing on and required you to give up all your financial money. Worldly goods and patriotic count though. Australian guy that said he was Jesus a pretty fucking interesting because there's this whole documentary on it and he has this woman

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       and the woman said that he said that she was married then, like halfway to the documentary. You feel that there was another girl in the past. He said she was married to a girl, thinks she's married and he thinks he's Jesus. It's fucking hilarious. Well, Mary was Jesus's mother, right? Uh, yes. So, but they're partying together and banging because the reincarnated. So really Mary. So Jesus was a motherfucker in his, his own motherfucker. I don't know. I love my, I don't know. All right. She's not married. The mother. She's Mary Magdalen the uh. Oh, the prostitute. It's fitting in. Maybe the other. Mary was the mom is the last gospel.

Speaker 6:          00:33:28       Is that what he says? Dan Brown? Yeah. The Brown was hanging with the hookers and very accepting of sex workers. Yeah. Why not? I mean, God made people horny. God knew what he was doing, but God made us monogamous. Joe. Oh, get me started. It's one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on. I have an intervention that Weinstein, yeah, you're going to get me married, you know, um, I told you in the email that I felt bad when your book came up on the show and I didn't know how to defend it. I didn't know what to do because I didn't, I was in that weird moment where I was recommending it because I like it because I think it's a great book. And he was saying that just debunked. Well, I think he picked data right? Which is always weird.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       Well, the thing is, any sort of popular non science or nonfiction book is you have to choose what data you're going to include, right? I mean there's an infinite amount of data and so of course you form an argument and then you present data that supports your argument. Did you ever consider, I'm arguing against herself. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. And in fact the book is, you know, the book is written as an argument against the standard narrative. So, you know, we had to present this. What is the standard narrative? Who believes this? You know, who thinks that people evolve to as monogamous. And so we quote quite heavily from those people, um, but you know, the thing is I, and I really appreciated your email and I, you know, we don't need to talk about this at any length, but it's not your job to defend the book and it's not even my job really to defend the book. I think once a book is out, it's out. The book is there,

Speaker 6:          00:35:15       but isn't it, it's not just the book, it's when someone goes hard on a book, it's not about you as well is expression of, of your

Speaker 2:          00:35:26       work. But see, that's the thing, I don't accept that association. And so if somebody wants to critique the book, that's totally cool and, and like, look, are there things that we may have misunderstood? Of course are the things we left out. Of course there are, you know, mistakes of course you know, that you're human. You made it right. There are hundreds of citations in that book. Now, if somebody says, as people have like, you know, uh, Chris Ryan, you know, deliberately misrepresented the science or doesn't understand the first thing about evolution or whatever it is, I just don't engage because the emotional cycle, what we were saying earlier about comments online, I think people will react to sex at dawn very emotionally. And so if they're reacting emotionally, there's no point in me engaging with them because they're expressing some something that's going on in their lives that I don't know anything about and I don't, they're suffering in some way.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       I'm not talking about Weinstein or anybody specifically, but there's an emotional reason to have that kind of reaction. Whereas if somebody says, look on page 72, you said that a Benobos are the only ape that does this and the actually gibbons do it as well. Okay. We can talk about that, you know, that's, that's factual. So when people say, oh, it's cherry picked, well, which cherries? What are you talking about? Specific thing and what's wrong with it? Instead of saying it's cherry picking is vast. General critic critique of the book. And if it gets about me, like, oh, that's because he wants to get laid, or one of the arguments was that it would be a good book to write. I think. I don't remember if he said or if his wife said it, it'd be a good book. And I really loved those two.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       They're great. They're cool. I just think, um, when it comes to monogamy and sexuality, people have a notion in their head and that notion almost always aligns with how they're living their life or how they wish they were living their lives. Yeah. Maybe. And again, we're not talking about specific people or I've never met them. I know they're a great couple. They're wonderful people. But I mean there's, there's something about the subject of your book. I think I told you this before, without naming any names. My friend brought your book home and his wife threw it away. Yeah. You and I talked about that on the very first podcast actually. Yeah. I've run into this a lot, right? You can imagine cocktail parties with me. It can get awkward very quickly for sure. You know, cause people ask, oh wait, you're the guy who. Yeah, you know, and then often you'll see some people are very eager to hear about it and talk about it. Other people are just steams coming out of their ears. I, I think, you know, a lot of people are in relationships that they're trying to make fit into what they believe is the right way to have a relationship and often it just doesn't. It doesn't work. And so there's a lot of shame and regret and resentment and all kinds of negative energy around that. And

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       so any discussion where you're saying, well maybe that's not actually the way it's meant to work for some people, that's an incredibly liberating message for other people. It's extremely threatening. Right. And I understand that. And, and you know, so I've become very emotionally sort of separate from the book. It's out there, it stands or not based on its merits. I don't. When people get all riled up, I've learned to just be like, yeah, you know what? That's fine. That's between you and the book. That's a very healthy approach. Good for you. It's just, to me, it seems like people that get most upset about it don't get most upset about it. For rational reason. They get upset about it because it challenges the way they live their life. Well, that's. I mean that's what I was saying about the gay preachers and stuff. It's like if you're getting that upset, that's about you, man.

Speaker 3:          00:39:27       It's not. I mean, if he disagreed with it, then disagree with it. That's fine. Is out gay preachers, people who love Jesus and are also gay. You can't do that. You can't figure that out. How can this guy can start a whole fucking call it in Australia and tell people about Jesus and his girlfriend's Mary and you guys can't get together and form yourself a nice gay church. I mean, do they have them that I don't know. The Vatican Dude, hey, have you heard all this stuff going on in Italy? They've got all their sex parties or their own country. Do you know when I was there when you just walk around the Vatican and just see the vast amount of pilfered riches that are all just sucked out by an ideology. I mean, that's really what it is. That church, that whatever the fuck you want to call it a religion, they just acquired an ungodly amount of wealth.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       Literally ungodly, ungodly. Yeah. It's fucking stunning. Yeah. Jesus is all about living in poverty and hanging out with sex workers and these guys are like just lavish wealth and it's crazy because if Jesus came back, the first thing he'd say, he's like, what the fuck have you guys done? Yeah. Like what have you done? Look at these gigantic places that you built and I told you guys, you don't even have to be anywhere for this. You don't. You don't need to have some ornate temple with stain glass windows. And it took craftsman like St Peter's Basilica. Like, is it a shock that that is probably one of the most stunning things that I've ever seen in my life. Like one of the most beautiful works of art, yet was created for this religion that most likely the people that were living in that day were probably like worshiping these people that were running this thing because if they were dating themselves and they needed them to have the biggest, craziest building that impressed the rubes right when they come into the country side and they walk into a cathedral like, holy fuck, the impact that it has on us.

Speaker 3:          00:41:29       You can't understate it still. Yeah. Yeah. And there, there are churches in. I would go into

Speaker 6:          00:41:33       it and I'm, I'm a pagan, but just go in there and just feel the space. Yeah, just feel it. The distance you just, you, your body knows how big it is or can you. It's like when you walk into an airplane hangar, you know, uh, it's, it's, it's not something you really can't overemphasize how crazy it is. Like these people built this without power tools. I mean, I don't know what kind of fucking ladders they used, but whatever they did it. Look at that. Fuck man. I mean, it's just crazy. You walk around that place, you can't believe how ornate it is, but at the same time this was happening. People were starving, you know, guaranteed. Like how old is that? Fifteen hundred 15. Oh, six. How well do you think everybody was doing financially in 15? Oh, six. I bet. Pretty fucking shitty. I bet everybody that lived around that place suffered and these motherfuckers were building these crazy places.

Speaker 6:          00:42:30       They have an obelisk in this whole place where you're these images right here. Where's Sean from? Egypt? This massive stone obelisk from Egypt and I was like, okay, how the fuck did they get that there? Yeah. It shows you how cheap labor was. Oh, do. Yeah. You could hire people for a lifetime, for a pittance, you know? Yeah. Really skilled artisans down. They couldn't go anywhere, man. What they did in that place, I mean the Vatican is just a. it's a stunning place, like way more so than I thought it was going to. Have you been to Spain? No, I have not looked at that. Oh my God, look at that.

Speaker 6:          00:43:08       That's what is that Jamie? What are we looking at? Is that the roof? Just St Peter's Basilica. Look at the fucking carving and everything and I'm telling you these. It's one of those things like you were talking about how you have to see another culture in per person owner to really appreciate it. I think that's the same with this thing. St Peter's basilica is one of those ones when you're there, like, look how little those people are walking around down there. See the top of their heads. That's it. Fucking places. Giant, beautiful light coming through. They're unbelievable. It's, it's, it's one of those game changers when you leave, they're like, to me it was way more impressive than the calcium. Calcium is very impressive, but it wasn't as impressive. What's not intact, but it's not even that. It's just like what it is, what it is, just craziness.

Speaker 6:          00:43:53       He's fucking impressive thing was the elevator complex. The dates set up the animals up from the floor like that is fucking nuts, man. Do you ever think about the coliseum when you're doing UFC commentary and it's kind of like this modern a little bit, right? Yeah. It's definitely a big violent distraction from everyday life that people really look forward to and enjoy, you know, for like entertainment value. I mean it says it's primal as you can get without anybody really dying, you know? I mean that's most of the time. Most of the time, I mean no one has in the UFC ever, but it's because they have the most rules and because they have the best medical staff and the best referees and all that stuff, but it's also just luck because like people can die sparring. It happens. What

Speaker 4:          00:44:43       if you're, if you're in a choke hold and you don't tap out,

Speaker 6:          00:44:47       you just go unconscious and then when they and then you'll be all right. Yeah, you'd be fine and you can feel when someone goes unconscious, the muscles relax. They just slump, slumping the referee. Sometimes the referee like pickup and arm, the old progressing move like they would check to see if the guy was still awake. I didn't pick the arm and the crowd would go back. Yeah, he's about to make us come back. But they do do that sometimes. Referee. I've seen referees pick a guy's arm up, see if the guy responds, or girl, you have two girls get choked out bunch. Um, but you know, people are tough. They don't want to tap and then we'll wind up going to sleep. Holly Holm, when she fought me, she tate, Misha Tate, choked or unconscious and before holly went out she was throwing punches in the air and she went unconscious. It's crazy. It was crazy. It was, it was prime. Most drownings like watching someone drown, you know. Um, so it's just, you know, you have a preference for how you die. Drowning drownings. My one of my least favorite seems like it would suck. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to do that. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:45:47       I have a buddy, he's a big wave surfer and a like 40 foot waves. Shout out to kyle and he did a breath holding course and he can hold his breath for five minutes. Jesus, because he goes, you know, if you get caught in one of those waves, you're like down in the deep for a long time. Yeah. Some really interesting. He was telling me some really interesting things like when a human being puts its face in the water, all sorts of physiological changes start happening. Your metabolism immediately slows way down your oxygen consumption cuts way back just automatically. We've got a lot of seemingly evolutionary adaptations to living in the water. Yeah. Have you ever heard

Speaker 6:          00:46:32       that aquatic ape theory? Does that make any sense? Does it fit citi? Someone should have already known that already.

Speaker 4:          00:46:39       It makes. Here's what it does in my opinion. We should explain it. Yeah. So the idea is I first read about it in a book by Buckminster Fuller, actually. Great. You know about him? Yes. Genius. Uh, the idea is that there, according to the people who support this theory, there was a period in human evolution where our ancestors lived in title areas, so they spend most of their time in the water that was about body temperature. So it was comfortable and it was shallow enough that they weren't worried about sharks coming in and deep enough that leopards and other predators from the land couldn't get at them. So it was safe in that respect. Also, you have a great sight lines so you can see if something's coming from a long way off and there's lots of there lots of mollusks

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       and fish and you can net and so it sort of made sense that they would be there. And so we have these physiological adaptations for aquatic living. Like for example, human infants are the only ape. Certainly, I don't know, primary, probably the only primates that know to hold their water or hold their breath underwater. Mm. So like that. Great. A nirvana album. Cover the baby. So you take a baby and dropped it in water and it holds its breath and breathe and die. Yeah. Whoops. Yeah. Gemstone can't even swim. So, uh, there's that, there's the fact that babies are really fat. So they flood. You can't teach chimps to swim? No. And also chimps don't have enough body fat to be buoyant. Right? They're super core. Did steal their bodies. I didn't know they could never teach them to swim. That makes sense to, but they're so smart.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       I guess they just can't do it. Huh? I don't know. But yes, if you see lots of contemporary zoos, they have the chimps surrounded by a moat right across the moat. Wow. What a bummer. They'll wait in water. I've seen chimps waiting, but you know, maybe then there's also the connection between eating fish and fish oil and brain health. Right. And it was a very strong correlation between fish oil and brainhealth. Yeah. So it could be related to fatty acid development and also you would have to be clever to try to dive into the water to go after those things. The smarter ones would probably survive, right? Even the nostrils like a nostrils come straight out of the face. And the idea of our nostrils facing down is related to the aquatic wow. A explanation. The oil glands that we have on our heads and faces and shoulders that, you know, cause acne and stuff and teenagers, uh, that's for protection from the sun apparently.

Speaker 2:          00:49:28       So there are lots of adaptations that seem to fit into this interpretation, but you know, lots of sort of mainstream evolutionary theorists would say, well wait a minute, you know, there are other adaptations we don't have and that we would have if that had been the case. So it's, it's controversial at best. Part of it was also the theory that the human brain, in order for us to be born vaginally, the brain could only be so big before the kid was born. Right, right. Yeah. I mean that's the explanation for why humans are born helpless. No, but what I'm saying is that we really can't. The brain can't get any bigger, right. Vaginal canal, unless our dicks get bigger and the is get bigger as well. I still hold bit about that, about Dick Pills, but if they're really word Dick Pills, no one's stopping at one. Like what's the dosage? Okay, how much gives me a stroke? I'm going to take one less than that. All the fucking dice or it. And the idea would that be every dude's Dick would just

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       become a super dick. And every woman will be, you know, she. It was a joke about flying squirrel, pussy people. They would just jump dudes with big dicks and shopping carts. We chase these girls to the edge of cliffs. The women would leap off with their vaginas. Bonnie would have to more to have to change for the big Dick Pills, but it doesn't. It does seem like if pew ones are going to get smarter, if the head is going to have to get larger, does that make any sense or is that just a crude way of looking at the brain? Is it possible that people can get smart? Like if we evolved, have you. If we evolved from lower hominids, it's generally assumed that those lower hominids had little brains or brains than us right up until like Australia pit tickets or something like that. What really seems to matter though is the ratio of brain size to body size, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:14       There are plenty of animals that have bigger brains than us that aren't obviously aren't smarter than us. Like elephant elephants, blue whales, blue whale brains. Probably the size of this room. Do we know if elephants are fucking super smart because isn't the thing about intelligence is not just like there's communication between elephants for sure, and we know that they recognize each other after long periods of time, like 20 years apart, they get together and they see each other and recognize each other instantly. Sure. So there's a, there's an intelligence that, but what we judge it, intelligence oftentimes depends on whether or not it can communicate with you whether or not it changes its environment builds a structure. I mean, that's, to me, this is one of the deepest questions in life. Do you see the elephant that painted a picture of it? Sure. Yeah. That's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:52:02       Yeah. In Thailand I think. Yeah. It's pull. Pull that up. That is one of those things where you go, okay, wait a minute, a dog can't do that. I thought you said this thing was a smart as a dog because that's 100 times they're like grey parrots that have 300 word vocabulary or ceiling. Yeah. I mean, I don't, don't quote me on that number, but Jamie can look that up there as they can speak a whole sentence and they can. And there's a guy, I remember seeing this recently, there's a guy who has a border Collie who obviously can't talk but understands well over 100 words and so what he'll do is he'll put all these different toys behind a wall and he'll say, go get me the, the yellow bunny. And there's like a yellow bunny or red bunny in a green bunny in addition to the hundreds of other shit.

Speaker 3:          00:52:47       And the dog will go find the yellow bunny and bring it back. Whoa. You know, go get me the, the, you know, the green turtle and you'll go get it. So the dog knows those words. Right? And also the dogs. He's in color. I Guess Predator, I guess you're seeing color think. So here's the elephant painting itself. It is fucking crazy because it really looks like itself and this guy helps it and gets the brush and puts it in his hand. But the elephant is essentially doing all of this with its trunk. And just replicating itself and it's proportional to its. It's really good. That's better than if the dude was holding his Tusk, training them to do that. I think. Well I'm sure their training or is he just pulling goes where they wanted to see, look at the trunk. Like he's definitely holding, but look at the trunk and look at how much motion is in that thing.

Speaker 3:          00:53:41       How could he possibly be controlling that? He's definitely lifting it up and down and helping them now. But what it is, is they're working together like the elephant knows to stay in these lines. It's doing it with him. You're not buying it in a mirror or anything. The hand on the Tusk is. There's another one. There are other ones, but let me see the other articles that say that they're being trained to do it and it's cruel or something. Yeah. Okay. This one right here, this thing doesn't have anybody's hands on it. I think this is the one that I had seen before. Let's see if there's any cases. The question of intelligence is so much more complicated than we generally credited with, uh, not only among animals but also among humans. There's this big controversy, the perennial controversy. That's the problem right now. We're constantly, we're looking at another video and this is the one that I had seen his.

Speaker 3:          00:54:41       Nobody's, nobody's touching. Nobody's controlling him here. Well, he doesn't have any tusks it looks like. Does he know? So that looked like the guy was just giving them the brush and he was doing it. Why don't they pull back though? So you could see if that's true. See, this is the one that I had seen before. He hadn't seen the other one. This one. I would imagine that, yeah, this is an assistant. I would imagine that if you did get a guy like this that teaches is elephant how to, how to paint a fucking picture that you're going to. It's going to become a tourist attraction. People are going to say, come and watch the elephant that paints the picture. You as seen on Youtube. And then next thing you know you've got a tourist business. Well, and if he always does the same picture to write, draws himself over and over again, but it's right here.

Speaker 3:          00:55:26       It looks to me at least like the elephants doing that. You couldn't even talk a four year old and doing that. So you know what I'm saying? Like four years here at elephant, you have to ask him what the fuck it is like, what is that like? That's an elephant. You're like, whoa. That elephants crazy. What does it do you think it knows it's drawing an elephant or it's. That's a good question, Mike. The Toronto tree, he probably doesn't know is drawing an elephant. If I had to guess I would get out of guests that it probably doesn't understand the two d space like that because if it did, it would start creating art. They start expressing themselves to each other. They start drawing directions like go this way. If you start seeing animals do that, that is so far beyond using tools. That's what bees do. These do it with smells, right? Well, they do it with a dance. Yeah, they. They give instructions on where the flowers are. So this question of intelligence is really interesting and I think very important because you know, we talk about intelligence as if know what it is,

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       but we don't, it expresses itself in so many itself in so many different ways. There's so many manifestation. So this big controversy that's happening now among, in between, I don't know if you're aware of this was Sam Harris and I'm as recline and Andrew Sullivan and people are trying to. Charles Murray, right, exactly. That whole thing about people that don't know what that Charles Murray wrote this book called the Bell Curve, I don't know, 20 years ago or something, 25 even where he argued that, uh, there are racial differences in intelligence, a ICU specifically with Asians being the highest and then whites and then blacks and that, that's just the way it is. And social adjustments aren't going to change that because it's largely genetic. And as I understand that was the argument. I haven't noticed saying largely genetic, but I think they're saying that genetics play a factor and environment plays a factor.

Speaker 6:          00:57:23       I think some people are not willing to look at genetics if it shows an unfavorable trait in minorities. They don't want to look at it. They, yeah, they did not true, but I think it's also true that part of the argument is that social programs are a waste of money because they're not going to affect it because it's genetic. That's crazy. I that I'm pretty sure that the argument that's just straight racist to me. Well, I think that's what people are the idea like save your money to save your money. No. Do a better job. Like you don't even know if it works because what have you done? Like what? Well go to an inner city school and pretend you're a 10 year old kid trying to get by in this life and you're literally seeing gang members and craziness and people flashing cash and people dropping out because they're pregnant when their 13th and you're trying to tell me there's not.

Speaker 6:          00:58:16       There's not some sort of a massive environmental factor. If you are a white kid going to a school like that. I only went to a bad school for one year of my life. I'm not, I'm no Oji, but I really did go to one bad school, Mary curly, a Middle School in Jamaica Plain and the Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. It's now it's become gentrified, sort of. It's kind of like East la or I'm a silver, silver lake area, you know, a lot of hipsters have moved in and nice places, but when I lived there it was not good. It was very poor people in the fucking middle school was scary. It was scary. Seventeen year old kids and my seventh grade class, no one it'd be, it was just a weird play. Maybe. I guess it was eighth grade, but the point was these kids were. They were never going to graduate. They knew it and they were trying to go back to seventh grade again or eighth grade, whatever the fuck it was, and the teacher would have them in the class for a couple of days and then they would leave and everywhere you walked you were scared everywhere you walk. Like some weird shit was happening with people. People yelling at people. There was always tension

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       and there was always like bigger kids around that were robbing other kids, like fuck. Like I got through that year going, Holy Shit, and when I got out of there, my parents moved, moved to a really nice part of town, Newton. But if you're a kid growing up in that environment, good fucking luck learning anything good. Fucking probably it's, it's pretty bad at home too. Yeah. And what I experienced in Jamaica plain was nothing compared to Dorchester and Roxbury. Those are the bad areas. They were way worse. And we know that anxiety, stress, um, stops brain development. Yes. Retards. Yes. It also makes people much more inclined to violence when you're, when you grow up in the, even in the womb, if your mother's around horrible situations and people screaming and fighting and that cortisol and adrenaline and all those, all those hormones are flowing through that baby.

Speaker 3:          01:00:09       Pairing that baby for a violent world. Well, I'm sure you know about the epigenetics that show that, that can pass several generations. Your grandfather was in a famine. You're more likely to be obese and that crazy. It's not. Yeah. You also live longer though, not weird like the people that were, um, that were in famine people, their kids lived longer for some strange reason. Interesting. Yeah. Like your body is preparing you and be extra durable like we were talking about before the podcast started. And fasting is the only intervention that's ever been shown to extend lifespan. Mm. Nut nuts. Yeah. I do it because it makes me. I'm just function better. I do it every 16 hours. I, I eat, so uh, I'll eat and then I don't eat for 16 hours so I'll eat for eight hours a day. That's it. When that's over, that's over 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM or whatever it is.

Speaker 3:          01:01:05       I just figured out what the time is and then add 16 to it cheating. I add 14 but I never had less than 14. I see. Yeah. I was talking to a guy recently about this. I'm Brian Fries and you're in Austin. Really, really smart guy. And we were talking about this and he's like, I only eat when the sun's up. It's easy to keep track of. That's good. And what if you want to go to a nice dinner? Don't eat cow, go earlier. I know you got to have cheat days. When he said it, I was like, dude, you know, I spend most of my life in Spain were dinnertime is 10:00 PM. Like, that's not gonna work for me. If I go to a restaurant, I'll allow myself to have a little bit of bread, allow myself to have dessert, occasionally, allow myself to eat some shitty things, maybe a little pasta. Feel like fuck it. You have to be. I think you have to both be disciplined. And also I enjoy the art form of cooking. I enjoy that people make these delicious dishes. Follow your elk and a Jalapeno instagram feed there. Joe Looks Great. Do you cook at all? I love cooking. Yeah. I have meat for you then. Oh, I have sausages Joe Rogan has made. For me.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       It was one of the early Beta thing again. So tell you a great. We're talking

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       about

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       the van. You know that my favorite thing in life is travel. And the reason I love travel is that you can wake up and have no idea what your life's going to be like by the time you go to bed. Right, right. So we're driving the van through along the Rio Grande de and we want to go to a big bend national park, which is beautiful. It's, you know, where that is. It's like that part of Texas and sort of dips down and then, you know, and there's like a big Ben don't literally a big Ben that's the river. Um, so it's way down South Texas. That's a weird spot. It's cool. It's, it's, it's interesting in south Texas.

Speaker 2:          01:03:00       Strange. Yeah. Yeah. She'd have a passport to go there.

Speaker 4:          01:03:04       I in the rivers like as wide as this room. I mean, it's nothing, you know, you could just walk across over to Mexico. Wow. Um, but anyway, so, so we get into, uh, the western entrance of big band and it's like 4:00 PM and the guy says, yeah, all the campgrounds are full. And it was like, ah, Shit. Okay, can I get a back country permanently? No, you can't, you gotta. Okay. So he says, just go back to a little town right there, spend the night there and then come in the morning and I'll hook you up. Okay, great. So we'll go back to this town. It's called Terlingua little town. We just drove through it on the way in, nothing there, you know, some houses, whatever. And um, and we find this restaurant and it's like, okay, we're just going to crash behind a dumpster in the van and, you know, whatever. And uh, spend the night there. So we're sitting there and I remembered somebody had sent me an instagram direct message like about Terlingua. So I'd go back and I find it and the guy's like, hey, if you get to Terlingua, Texas, you should look up my buddy tony.

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       He's really cool. So here's his, his handle site. You can't tell people that you're willing to do this because now they're going to be sending you direct messages. Oh, they do it all the time and see bits. You're paranoid it was going to be a dude with a ball gag in his hand and you've got to go what? And then you get to feel that wet cloth filled with chloroform. See, you're in a different world. Joe. I'm, I'm in a world of micro podcasting where everybody who reaches out to me, he likes me, he reaches out to you, I'm sure, and they're not crazy. They're just want to tie you up a little. Hey, what's wrong with that? I remember showing you what time, long time ago I was here doing a podcast in my phone and a message came in and I looked and it was this really hot woman in Australia who liked to send me naked pictures of herself and I showed it to you and you're like, that's a trap. It's a trap trap. Trap, trap. Looks like right there.

Speaker 2:          01:05:00       They are different over there. They're there. They're far away. They are interesting people. Anyway, that's a place I would live. I like Australia. It would live there. Trillion people. They're funny, as funny as fuck, but they get American comedy straight away. Like there's no. There's no problem with doing shows over that. Humor is an interesting thing. Cultural Humor. Anyway, let me finish this story. So I texted this dude, I'm like, Hey, I'm interlink way, you don't know me, but some friend of yours, whatever. He texts us back if you were in this restaurant, come have a beer. So we go to this restaurant, there's this table, maybe a dozen people center the table, Hey, come buy a, have a beer. A really nice people. Uh, after about 15 minutes I say to somebody, are you guys tripping? He's like, yeah, we, yeah, we ate some mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       Some of them did, some of them did anyway, but super relaxed and uh, somebody makes some joke about like, their, their beer glass was dirty or something and someone else's like, yeah, just lick it. It's good for your microbiome. And I'm like, Oh, you guys know about microbiome? Like, yeah, yeah. I said, I read this article a couple of years ago. This dude, you probably read this article yourself. This dude was in Africa with the Hadza people, the hunter gatherers, and he took some Hadza shit and he mixed it up and blasted it up his ass to see if he could get a hunter gatherer is microbiome because it's a much more complex microbiome. Right. I say this to this dude thinking he's gonna have a reaction like you just had, and he says, oh yeah, that's him. He points to the end of the table. I said, what have you guys have?

Speaker 2:          01:06:39       No Air's coming. The guys look at me, smile and I said that you, that's you. He's like, yeah. He asked me. You blasted fucking 100 gala. Yeah, yeah. I do this thing in Africa. This guy is a world famous scientists, microbiome expert, spends half his life in Africa with this hunter gatherer group and the other half in this tiny little town in Texas and there he is, and so we stayed there for days. Became great friends with this guy. I did a podcast with him. Fantastic. Jeff Leach. I'm going to tangentially speaking the podcast available on Itunes, stitcher, and everywhere else available. We're fine. Podcasts are found. Wow, I'm going to listen to that one. That sounds amazing. What a coincidence was the trip and that was totally fell out of the sky. We went to visit Peter Gorman, you know him. He was editor of High Times magazine in the seventies.

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       First person to write about Iowasca in the western press. Not Scientifically, but popular press. Oh Wow. Explore the Amazon for years. Was all over down there. First person to write about Sapo, you know the, the burn. Yeah. Yeah. Really interesting dude. He's in Texas too. Wow. We drove up to see him. So it's Kinda like just cruising around in the van, like hanging out with cool people. I heard that frog poison stuff is horrible that the trip. Yeah, I mean I guess it was Aubrey wasn't an artery that was on the podcast talking about doing the tree frog poison. Pretty sure it was him. He's done everything. He's like Mikey from that commercial, but for life he hates everything. He's in there. That's all

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       he loves. Everything takes everything. But he, um, he was saying it was just a terrible ordeal, but there was, um, there was also an article that I read about certain countries where they didn't have an endogenous psychedelic or didn't have a local psychedelic, so these people would take ordeal poisons, so they would take poisons that would get them like literally to the brink of death and then they would come out of it like a near death experience and that this near death experience provided some sort of a shamanistic, you know, um, uh, some sort of a breakthrough experience where you could move on to the next level. Like you had experienced something that was like, like we were talking about before the podcast, like when you lived in Portland and then coming here in la when it's sunny out, you're like, ah, Simon, you just feel it like that.

Speaker 6:          01:09:04       It's similar, a similar theory about a Africa that there aren't a lot of endogenous psychedelic plants. They're Boga is one of the only ones and that's incredibly strong and not available all over the continent. And so they develop complex rhythms to provoke a altered state. Hmm. That makes sense and that's why African rhythms are so complex and native American rhythms are very simple. That's because they were hot as fuck, fuck already. And just boom, boom, boom. As you know. Have you heard, have you ever heard any of the Eco rose that ob replays when he has his little? No, they. He's got these arrows that he got from these South American Shamans and I listened to him sometimes when I write because I like listening to things that I don't know the language when I write like I like a guy, like some music from Armenia, some Lebanese music I like.

Speaker 6:          01:09:59       It's cool listening to things where I have no idea what they're saying so I don't get wrapped up in what I feel their emotions, but I don't get wrapped up in whatever they're talking about so I can write about whatever fucking table tops. So a lot of good music out there. And Brazilian. The African? Yeah. I. Most of the music I listened to, I don't understand the words because I really fixate on the words if I do. The ECO rows are crazy because they, they make the psychedelic trip dance to them, like dmt dmt with the negroes. You realize like the [inaudible]. It's like a technology that was invented to work with DMT, right? Like this is like, give me some volume on this shit. This is what they sound like

Speaker 6:          01:10:50       now by itself. You listen to this right now and you go, oh, this is just like some weird slow music, but when you're in the dimension of dimethyltryptamine and the world has become infinite fractals that are moving and changing and morphing. When you hear this song, the hallucinations or whatever they are that you're experiencing the visualizations, they danced to the song 100 percent in sync, so all this. It's comforting. Yeah. That's another thing that keeps people from having bad trips sometimes because they can cling to the music and the structure in the music. Whereas their own paranoia and fear and inability to let go gets hit with that psychedelic Jews and just experienced that new and some people freak out, but this music might be able to bring them down. It sounds like what a fetus might hear in the womb

Speaker 7:          01:11:47       got that heartbeat to. Yeah, right. Imagine what fetus here.

Speaker 6:          01:11:57       See, I like listening to this kind of shit when I write because I don't have no idea what they're saying and so I can just keep it on the background and also makes me feel like just knowing, just knowing that that's out there, knowing that the DMT world is out there, it makes me just a little bit nervous. It makes you write better when you're writing jokes or others, everything, whatever. Either you ever written a book or essay or stuff. I've written essays to write a lot in some of your essays. One, are we talking about it? Yeah. You run a beautiful one couple of years ago about that that I really, I don't know if I've ever told you how much I appreciated that actually. It was about, um, how the quest for optimal fitness shouldn't be taken as in mortality. That we're all going to die.

Speaker 6:          01:12:46       And do you got to sort of deal with that? Do you remember what I'm talking about? I think I wrote your body's a sandcastle. That's what it is. Sand castles are beautiful, but one of the beautiful things about this, we know how temporary they are when you see a sand castle, it's not just like, oh, this guy made an amazing sculpture, so I go, no, this person made something that they know is not going to last, and they put a massive amount of work into it, but part of the beauty of it is that a soft collar? Yeah. I really, I enjoy that. I think that was for a magazine. Yeah. I forget what magazine. So you have a book in mind. I started writing a book and then I had to deal with the publishing company, like wanting. They wanted very specific kinds of writing.

Speaker 6:          01:13:26       Oh, that's. Yeah. It's for maximum. That's what it was. Um, they wanted very specific, like they want a jokey jokes. They, they even offered to just pay me to transcribe my act. And I was like, I don't want to do that. And they go, but these people did it. Some famous comedians did it. I said, that's fine. I just not what I want to do. I like writing, but I like writing shit that I feel like writing, like I don't, I don't want to have some. So when we went into it they like, we love your blogs, we think you're really funny. Uh, this will be good for you had the podcast. Yes. Yeah, so I gave him all their money back. I just, I don't want to do this. Yeah, just at this point on free, free range to do whatever you want it. I just think that anytime you willingly take on some new project

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       managers and others, they might like their, their opinion might very well be valid, but I'm not looking for it. I want whatever I write to be out of my head and whether it's good or bad, dependent upon how much focus and attention I put into it, you know, I, I'm pretty self critical so if I think it's Clunky, I'll try to Redo it, but I'm not interested in like artistically or creatively going down a direction where somebody else is picking the subject matter or somebody else's suggesting like, I'm not.

Speaker 2:          01:14:42       That's fine. There's no reason for you to do that. I mean, you've got the massive platform and well established voice. You don't. I think honestly, I think publishing is at the napster stage right now. I think it's. It's sort of collapsing. I'm at, I'm finishing this book I've been working on for a few years now and I don't know that I'll ever published another book with major publishers will. You've had great success with

Speaker 5:          01:15:06       podcast as well, but the beautiful thing about your podcast is it allows you to put out an idea almost instantaneously. I mean you get together with this rattlesnake guy, you guys have a couple of our conversation. You upload that shit and that's it.

Speaker 2:          01:15:17       It's wonderful and it brings these really interesting people into my life and my circle of friends now is largely composed of either guests or listeners of the podcast. You know, it's. Yeah, it's wonderful. I just put out a book recently that's a sort of compilations of podcasts, so it's not the whole conversation obviously, but it's excerpts and the whole thing was crowd sourced. So people who listen to the podcast pick the episodes they picked, what part of the episodes that they thought was most interesting. They transcribed it. This Guy Adam mcdade did all the art, the publisher misfit press or people that I know through the podcasts. They reached out to me and we had some beers and it was not intending to do anything together. Just like, hey dude, we're in town and we'd like your show. Can we get a beer and really liked these guys and ended up having the CEO on the podcast aj and um, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:16:16       So we just put out the book and it's, it sort of fulfills my fantasy of being a writer without having to write, you know, if I could, I do what you're in it, you, you remember you signed a release for her. I remember remember that Joe, you and Duncan and Duncan and my mother blurbed it. It's. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even know you blurbed it. We just lifted something you said on a, on a podcast about you. He said, perfect. Was. He said, whatever it is, I sign off on it now. You said Chris is the, is the best Beta cook I've ever met and uh, anyway, so yeah, that, that's my dream is to put out one of these a year. That's a great idea. And I mean really there's a lot of amazing conversations that I've had with people on this podcast that I would love to see written down or I could read it, go over it and let's not here my own fun.

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       And also it's, you people have in the bathroom, you know, it's like a little thing. You just pick it up. Whatever it is, there's no, you don't need to follow the flow or the end. You're encouraging reading, which is a dying thing and people and in there are a lot of people out there who don't listen to podcasts. Right. Me included. I rarely listen to podcasts. Do you listen to books on tape? No, no, no. We'll see. I don't have spaces in my life where I'm doing something that would allow me to listen to voices talking that wouldn't interfere with what I'm doing. So like, yeah, I'm not a carpenter. I'm not driving long distances, you know, it's like I'm either writing or I'm doing the doing my podcast or something else, but there's not, I don't commute, you know what I mean? So, so there's a specific sort of activities that lend lend themselves to listening to podcasts and a lot of people just don't have those spaces in their lives. So I envisioned the book is like something where people can be like, hey dude, I know you don't listen to podcasts, but this is why I do. These are the sorts of crazy ass conversations that Chris and Duncan and Joe get into. And that's why I like listening to those guys, you know, or Wim Hoff or Graham Hancock and all these guys are in the book. Oh, awesome. Yeah, yeah. Man

Speaker 6:          01:18:28       Stopped. I thought about it because before I started doing the podcast, I would listen to recordings of like lectures at Terence Mckenna would give or a timothy leary or you know, and there wasn't a lot, you know, you or listen to art bell having some weird, a ufo expert on or something like that. I mean, that's really what you had to listen to. You didn't have very many choices. And then I think about all the conversations that I've been able to have with guys like John Anthony West with Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and Michael Shermer and you and Duncan and I mean so many people had these crazy conversations with them. That to me, they've been. I mean, I, it's shaped the way I look at everything. It's changed everything and so I feel like I'm constantly getting educated, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:19:15       Yeah. You set up your life as like, not, I'm not talking about myself, but you've had guests who are some of the smartest people in the world who come to you to sit here and chat with you for, you know, I mean, that's. You have set up an amazing little educational institution

Speaker 6:          01:19:34       here at times. Sometimes it's education, sometimes it's chaos, but it's slow. That's education certainly is. You learned about what we're like when we're drunk, but it's what it is is it's a fan. You know what I mean? It's a thing and it's a thing that's enjoyable to me. Like A. It's like I like having all these conversations so if I can record them and they just put them out there and other people like them. It's. This is a very rare, a balanced sort of relationship. So to me there's no other way I'd get like if I said to you, Hey Chris, let's sit

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       down and talk for three hours. You'd be like, I'm okay. All right, I'll block off three hours for you. Can I look at my phone at all during this time? Can I get up to go to the bathroom? We would never have this. Like as connected a conversation, I just got another set of headphones to give to my guests because the extensively. The main reason is I'm using handheld now because my whole thing is mobile right below occasionally come to my place in Topanga, but normally I go to them and they can't hear when they're not here, so I have to keep like going, hey, hey, the mic, you know, there are a lot of them. They're not used to talking on Mike's and all that, but the other reason I got it is my buddy kyle actually pointed out to me that when you both have headphones, you're both in a shared space and you're much less likely to be thinking about your phone or whatever because you're both like, I dunno what it does, but it, it seals it off in a way.

Speaker 3:          01:21:02       Yeah. We talked about that yesterday. Actually. Me and Eddie Bravo talked about it because he doesn't like to wear them because he doesn't like the sound of his own voice. And I said, well, he and I are so comfortable. We'd been friends for so long. I didn't. We didn't need to wear them, but I feel like when you're having a conversation with someone, it cuts out everything else. Right. It's just youtube, they're like, there's no distractions in the room, but if there were they would be less distracting because the headphones. Well that's the thing I'm out, like sitting in a, in a campsite somewhere by a river or whatever. There's a lot going on. And the handheld microphone too. It was a big thing and if you get a mic, picks up everything, then they pick up everything. Everything. Like they pick up some shit over by the outhouse, you'd hear in the background.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       It was using a lapel mics for awhile, but they were um, the directional is too much and people were complaining and like, dude, I can't in the car. I can't hear you. So I got the handheld. It is an interesting thing, right? Because this is not something that it production company would ever get together and fund because they would say if they did, they'd have a sound guy and they'd have a like half the fun is watching you. Well, will this one sock these, these mikes are bullshit, right? We're not doing that anymore. You know, we've done a few from an iphone. We used to do podcasts on a plane, like we'd be, you know, me and Duncan are me and Ari or whoever it was would be on a plane next to each other. I just take the iphone between us, press record and start talking voice notes and turn into a podcast and it's not that bad.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       Yeah, I did that recently in the van. I was driving. I had some ideas. I just grabbed my phone and started talking into it and I threw it up. People like it because they knew one thing they know this is one of the things that's appealing about podcasts in general is that it's not produced right. It's just this is what it is. You know? It's like you've got an idea and I'm getting it right from Chris Ryan's head. It's going right from his head right in that phone that's going right into my ears. There's nothing, there's no filters. There's getting right into your head. It's one of the weirdest things about podcasts in general, is that the intimacy of your voice in someone else's head, like I'm sure when you meet them they get weirded out. Right? A lot of people get really weird because you got in their head and all of a sudden you're right in front of them. Hey, like, yeah. And it's, it's strange like they

Speaker 4:          01:23:05       know you, but you know, they really do know you. It's not like fame where you're an actor and people like, Oh, I know your face. Like, yeah. But yeah, I mean people really do know Joe Rogan. Yeah. Strangely. Yeah. So there are parts I know both of us have parts of our lives we don't talk about on the podcast specifically your marriage. I guess I don't like to talk too much, but yeah, I'm that way too. I, my impulse is to talk about everything. Like on my impulse is like I got nothing. I got no secrets because I feel like there's a, like a revolutionary shamelessness. Um, you know, I feel like I feel so privileged and largely thanks to you and Duncan. Honestly, when I started the podcast and you guys did that shrimp parade thing and that really built up my audience and to the point now where it paid, it's self sustaining and it's my main gig.

Speaker 4:          01:23:59       That's awesome. It is awesome. It's incredible. But it's like, I feel like there's a responsibility I have in a way to express yourself shamelessly because everybody else has a job they can get fired from or a marriage that they can get screwed. The wife can leave them or they can. I'm in vulnerable and so I kind of feel like, all right, so the cost of that, you know, every opportunity or every privilege comes with a responsibility. The responsibility is like I got to talk about shit that other people don't talk about so that it's out there. Right. And so my impulse is to just say everything, you know, and my sex life is really has been very interesting and I'd like to talk about it more, but I don't want to, you know, other people never sort of said they were down for that, you know, so

Speaker 6:          01:24:50       that too, that's magnified when you have children because they have no say, well that's the vulnerability. They put their kids out there and I'm like, well, okay, I'm not saying it's the worst thing to do, but it's not the child's choice. And they're very young and you're making a huge, your look like whoever did what they did to Michael Jackson, right? Yeah. One of the things that they did is they made him famous way before he had any idea what the fuck that meant. And they profited off of it. Yeah. They kind of pimped them out. Right. And that's kind of what's happened. And I destroyed him, but ultimately the whole thing destroyed him. Right. And um, I just, I don't want to be a part of that. I just, there's no, that's smart. I don't think it's intelligent. And I also don't, this is my real honest feelings. I do not think that fame is a. I don't think that people should aspire to it. I think it should be something that happens if people like your work and then it's cool, it's fine, but I think there's way too much emphasis put on just trying to get attention and it's being rewarded and supported in this weird way. There's nothing wrong with getting attention, but it should make sense. It should make sense.

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       There should be some reason. And if it's out of balance, you know, you should, you should probably look at like why? Why is it out of balance.

Speaker 4:          01:26:13       Yeah. And lots of things that attract attention are not things that we need. We, we want more of, you know, like conflict. Yes, conflict. That's a big one.

Speaker 5:          01:26:23       But it's also the. I just fame itself. One of the weirdest parts about it is that you have to constantly be checking yourself. Like all these people are nice to you. All these people are saying nice things to you or being mean to you. You know, one of the like Dave, all people that you don't even know, so you can't rely on them for your self esteem and you certainly can't rely on them for criticism. You can't rely on them. People you don't even know that don't care about you, you know, so you, you, you're in this weird position. You have to be very careful with who you communicate with because one of the weirdest things you'll see from famous people is all the sudden they get this very strange thing where they feel like people are supposed to do things for them and you know, they don't, they're not supposed to pay for things and everything's supposed to be easy and they're supposed to get that. That's a, that's a weird one. Like they don't respond to criticism. Well, they don't understand that they're still a human being in the middle of growth. No, they're a fucking star. I'm a fucking star and I want this and I want it

Speaker 4:          01:27:25       now. And they just like, what kind of fucking bullshit is this? Do you know who I am? Yeah, exactly. We've seen, we've all seen like a version of that right about it. The problem though is that they know that their shit stinks. Yes. They know that they're human. They know so they're. So then they develop this sort of fraud, a phobia that people are going to find out what they really are. I mean, I've seen this with fashion models, you know, I used to hang out with a lot of fashion models in Barcelona that, you know, that whole story where I lived in the mansion with the fashion models. Did you talk about that? Could be, I don't know. I'm not sure, but looking track of what the fuck we've talked about possible. It's impossible. Yeah. Anyway, so uh, yeah, I fashioned model become fame, wealth people who are extremely wealthy and that gets back to the 70 grand a year thing and the whole sort of question of, you know, saturation,

Speaker 5:          01:28:24       you know, what else it is, it becomes a real problem with things being too easy and life being like way to a patterned like you. Everything is very predictable in terms of your success. You have plenty of money. You have a adulation from fans without any stress or direct. Are you going to have a little bit of stress in terms of like trying to manage your career, but it's nothing like trying to make it that. I don't know if I'm ever going to make it stress. That's a totally different kind of stress. I don't know if I'm ever going to be a success dress. That's real shit that goes away once you definitely become Kanye West or whoever the fuck you are and then you're subject to your own demons because then you're alone.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       You're really alone. You can't even go to the grocery store. You spend any time with Jim Carrey. No, I don't know. I'd love to meet that guy. He seems like he's in a weird stage of his life. He seems to me like someone who, who you talked about, you know, you get to that pinnacle and you have to deal with your demons. Yeah. It seems like he's dealt with them and now he's come out the other side and he's in this very sort of this place of wisdom and uh, and yeah, it's, I, I just think he, he sounded. Russell brand is another guy who I think I really admire what, where they are in their lives and how they got there. They sort of went through the fire and they've come out the other side somehow. Rustled certainly has. I know Russell, he's, he's a sweetie.

Speaker 2:          01:29:51       He really is a super sweet guy, like genuine too and really trying to like be a better person and a better human and you know, I don't agree with him on everything. He gets a little social. Justice warriors are on some things, but I think it's just because he wants to do good and he's like leaning towards good and he's leaning towards love and he's like, it's all for the right reasons. Like every, even if I don't agree with them, I see how he's thinking. And even if I don't agree with Ms Dot [inaudible] do not agree. It's not a hard. Do not agree. It's. Yeah. Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. I think, uh, if Jesus came back, he'd be Russell brand probably. Fuck a few less checks. Maybe Jesus would go just swinging dick all over the place just to remove everybody, have their ego.

Speaker 2:          01:30:31       Everybody. You don't possess these women. Uh, years ago I, uh, I came back from Asia, I was in Asia for a couple of years and I visited my best buddy in Paris and we're throwing a football around. I remember. And some backstreet in Paris, which freaked out the per regions of course. And my buddy's like the opposite of me. He's religious, he's disciplined, he's speaks seven languages, you know, musical prodigy. I'm a lazy fuck a girl growing up it was like I was kirk, he was spock, you know, is that kind of dynamic half your audience wouldn't even know who we're talking about it. They're not sad. But, um, he, uh, which explains why I've always wanted to fuck a green woman that got this thing. But uh, he said it to me. He's like, Chris, I figured you out man, as what's, what's the deal?

Speaker 2:          01:31:18       He said, you're the anti monk, said, what do you mean? He said, monks cut themselves off from the temptations of life in order to pursue a spiritual path. You're, you're pursuing a spiritual path, but it's by way of the temptations of life. You immerse yourself in them because in those days I was doing a lot of drugs and you know, whatever. And uh, I think he's right. And in Buddhism there is a path of the drunken guru right the, there, there is a path of sex and altered states of consciousness and sort of, you know, William Blake said the palace of wisdom lies at the end of the road of excess.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       You know? And so someone like Russell brand, I think that's his path. He's gone through the, the addictions and the orgies and all that stuff that a lot of people think would make them happy. He's like, check those boxes like now that didn't do it in a way that very few humans ever get to check them. Family is a beautiful man and a superstar. And he came on the other side and became this really conscious, very spiritual person. And very humble and a sweetie. Nice guy. I think humility is what you find if you get through to the other side. Yeah, I think so. I think if you. But even when you get through the other side, it's like there's no, there's no destination. It's not like a spot you get to like find that can relax. I'm here. Yeah. Well he's used that phrase a minute ago.

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       Like, you know, trying to make it. Yeah, make it. It's like it's as if you'll make it and then you'll have it made, you know, like what, what, what did we make? What's made that make it thing is really for a comic is just this, uh, the high likelihood of success is always looming over you. And what is success? Being able to flick special. I'm not even just being able to work. Just being a working, working comedian. Just paying your rent with your standard. That was always the dream. Like every comic that starts out, if they're being honest. Fitzsimmons and I have talked about this a hundred times because it was, we'd never thought of a career. I mean if it fits him is this one, I think he's won at least two emmy's for writing. Brilliant guy and you know, we were just two dorks to 21 year old dorks hanging out together in Boston and we did.

Speaker 3:          01:33:39       You were a fucking martial arts expert in those. A martial arts expert. I was a Dork. Dude. I would get nervous talking. I've talked about this. I never could figure out why I freak out when I would be about to talk to a bank teller, like walking up to. I'd get like social anxiety. I would know. I was nervous. It's not a good place to look. Nervous. Not. Yeah, exactly. I mean, but back then it didn't make sense because I was fighting and I would still get nervous talking to like any person who is in an official person, any person, like a teacher or a principal or anybody that authority and authority figure. I was super nervous talking to them, but my wife gets out way around. Anyone wearing a uniform freaks her out because she was in a war when she was a kid.

Speaker 3:          01:34:20       Oh Wow. So like immigration guys. She just, she starts shaking and say workers. Yeah. Yeah. No, I hear you man. Well, uniform means uniform behavior, right? Uniform me. Chicken goes sideways. When's the last time you wore a tie into uniforms? Probably when I was taking the photos for my 19, 99 cd cover, real seedy. I decided to dress like a, like old school. Frank Sinatra just decided when I. When I made the CD, I was thinking I never wear a tie and a suit and a tie to be fun if I just decided to wear a suit and a

Speaker 2:          01:34:57       tie for the cover of this. So that's it right there. That's probably brad pack the last time. I'm going to be some day.

Speaker 2:          01:35:07       Yeah. That's the theme song to my podcast is you're going to die one day. I don't want to give the end away, but you're going to die one day. That's a good song. Carpet a fucking DMV. Yeah. Enjoy it. I mean, don't dwell on it too much. I'll freak out. You know? Well, it's like, I think every young man should shave his head like at 21 or something. Shaved your head. See yourself bald for a month or however long it takes to grow back and it's like, okay, that's it. You're not going to worry about Ted's though will say this, but you have a normal head. I don't know. I've never shaved my head. I don't know. I have a friend. It looks like his kid, his parents never picked him up for the first year and otherwise to just let them lay down on a flat marble pillow.

Speaker 2:          01:35:51       His head is flat like a fucking pizza is poor bastard on the top or the back of it. It's flat. I think his parents just ignore the shit out of him and he's got a flat head. You know about the flathead Indians. Which ones are those? There was a up in Idaho that area. Northern. Yeah, they, they would put. Oh yeah, yeah. They put a board on the baby's head because the heads are so malleable and then tighten it and they look like coneheads, like scare the fuck out of anybody. I'm sure you saw those dudes riding up war paint. Flatheads.

Speaker 5:          01:36:24       And that was a thing about, um, some of the, I think was it, was it Peru where they would do, they would find a lot of these skulls from a certain period of time that had been elongated and you know, the alien people went nutty. Like this is it, this is evidence, evidence of contact the aliens they've been here, but it's just boards. They just put boards in the side of their heads and stretched her heads up. Yeah. They think they might've even been trying to emulate one of, like, originally the idea was bounced about that someone in the royal family in Egypt had deformities. And that was one of the things that said about king Tut. Like King Tut was not a healthy person like that. He might may very well have been the product of incest and that there was some gender. Do you remember reading about this?

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       Right? Yeah. I know about the incest in the options. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:37:18       That some of the like heads when you see people like with like, hey, elongated heads and hieroglyphs and images, they might have actually done that to try to replicate someone who had something fucked up to normalize it, which might have been like a royal who had been like look at their debts. His head. That's his actual head. So on the left. Yeah. That's to tongue cut. Is that his real head?

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       Peru, Peru. Oh, these are giants

Speaker 5:          01:37:46       science goals. But they have. They have King Tut's head too though. You see if you can google king Tut's at the ones improved. They know they're pretty like 90

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       with a high degree of certainty. I don't wanna give you a number, but that they use boards and and example of that is in Spanish. Look at what tufts had. Must've looked like it was all fucking weird. It was all stretched out. Like look at that. Like if you saw, if you saw that on the ship of a spaceship on the deck, like walking around and I'm like Oh my God, that's the alien. Oh he must be from another planet. Right. Like if you were on a spaceship, say if you watch star trek and that dude walks by like, well for sure that dude wants to be playing someone from another Martini on his head. The top of his head is flat. There's always an extra brain. It looks like there's like 10 percent extra brain. Maybe more. What? What the fuck is going on back there?

Speaker 6:          01:38:37       Here's the flathead Indians. This is a painting of Caitlin did at the babies that would make you very non aerodynamic. You'd be like a land rover defender, like a big flat square thing. Similar schools though. Oh Wow. That normalizing crazy. Looking in a royal weirdness. You ever hear Spanish people speak? They have the list. Will they say that? Because one of the kings had a list and then all the court deers started replicating it to seem cool. You had told me about that and I had forgotten when it came up the other day when someone was bringing up a beat and then. Yeah. And then I remembered it after the podcast was over. Yeah. I don't know that that's true that. I mean, I haven't looked it up if it's historically accurate or even if there's a way to know because there are no recordings.

Speaker 6:          01:39:32       Right. Do you know the powdered wig one? Do you know what? No, no. That's the best. Dad is a weird one that came from syphilis. Really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. How? Because men started getting syphilis, find, find out what year it was. I forget what year. We just brought it up recently, but there was a royal family, I think two brothers. They both had syphilis and they started losing their hair and a lot of men were losing their hair to syphilis back then. They just had it. Nobody knew what the fuck it was. Right? So they would make wigs and the more expensive, more expensive the wig was, the bigger would be. So the really rich people would be big wigs, big wigs. That's where big waves come from and they literally put this style on to mask the effects of syphilis. Jesus, it's a great story.

Speaker 6:          01:40:17       I didn't know syphilis made your hair fell fall. Fall. Yeah. You've teeth rot out. You're falling apart, man. And your nervous system gets shoot shooting. You're rotten ges into somebody and given it to them too. And you don't even know what the hell's going on. Louis the 14th. He was only 17 when his mom started thinning. Yeah. So I'm 16, Fifty five when the King of France started losing his hair. And so, uh, if you scroll down, it goes into the, the whole syphilis thing we get out. So where, where's the syphilis part mentioned? Up above that. He probably had buck and crazy. Oh, brother's head stuff. Apparently everybody it back then. And you just

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       imagine these people. I mean they only lived to be 30. The syphilis outbreak sparked a surge and wig making victims hid their baldness as well as bloody sores that scoured their faces with wigs made out of horse goat or human hair. Perutz were also created a coded rather with powder sentence with lavender or orange to hide any funky aromas. Although common wigs were not exactly stylish, they were just a shameful necessity. So the King of France started losing his hair and 1655. And that's when everybody hopped on. And his cousin Charles, the second to the same thing, both men likely had syphilis.

Speaker 3:          01:41:33       Syphilis created a whole, like a thing where like judges would wear those wigs, powdered wigs. They would look like they were important. People look at my wig, you know, we're doing right now. Tribalizing right now. Yeah. So we're looking at our own culture, British culture in this case, but, and, and seeing how it's all this arbitrary silliness. And that's travel. That's what travel does for sure. You know, because you see it in other cultures and then you look back at your own and you're like, oh shit, we do weird shit to fuck. We're all weird. There is no, it's like the uh, what is an Einstein right? That there's no fixed point from which to observe anything. You're always on a moving. Your perspective is always mobile. So there is no objective truth. Culturally it's, it's all looking at one thing from another thing in both of them are moving.

Speaker 3:          01:42:26       Yeah. I love that shit. Yeah. Because, and again, I think it leads to humility. I think so too. You know, I think all roads lead to humility. Ultimately, it just leads to a greater perspective. I mean if you live in a small town, and I'm not knocking Ohio, Jamie, but if you live in a small town in Ohio, that's what you're used to and you kind of like develop your pattern of what you expect to see in the world based on what's around you in a, in a very close, immediate area, but if you're in the fucking rain forest to Bolivia and you're hanging out with these tribal folks who are going to go hunt a monkey and you're with them on a monkey hunt and they're all excited, they shoot this monkey out of a tree with a bow and Arrow they made themselves and then they're cooking this monkey over a fire and throwing wet leaves on it, smoking it, and you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          01:43:11       And these people do this every day and they're going to die in this forest. I mean, this is what they. This is what they do. This is how they live. And for you it's like I gotta get Outta here. For them, this is like, this is the small town in Ohio. There's just a small town in Ohio in the jungle like this. To them, this is their world and maybe interestingly for you, it isn't. I gotta get Outta here. Maybe it's like this is where I should, should have been my whole life. There are thousands of cases of people from civilization running away to go native. There are no historical cases that I know of where native people have chosen to come and live in civilization. Yeah. I hate to beat a dead horse because I always it with Sebastian Junger's

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       tribe is amazing book. I really enjoyed that. I talk about too much. It's one of those things. It's good to me.

Speaker 4:          01:43:59       It's uh, it is really good. I've read it three times. It's a short book. Yeah, it's one of, it's uh, it covers a lot of the same ground that I cover in civilized to death. Actually. I quote him in civilized to death and some of them we have some of the same sources, but yeah, he looked at some of the, that uh, those accounts of people running away to go live with the natives and it makes sense. Totally makes sense. Like a dog you ever read? Um, call of the Wild Jack London. London, yeah. It's a school. It's a very good book and it's about a husky who goes and lives with the wolves. It's essentially the story of the domesticated being going and living with the wild iterations of that same being, right? So it's like one of us and going to go live in the Amazon or whatever. There's a fantastic book if you like. That kind of thing is at play in the fields of the Lord. I've heard that, but I never read that one book, man. Peter Matheson. That's a book, right? Isn't there? Probably 30 years old, maybe more. And it was made into a film starring down Daryl Hannah and Tom Waits. And uh, who else? John Lithgow, Kathy Bates. Incredible, incredible cast.

Speaker 6:          01:45:12       There's something that you get from escaping civilization that you, if you don't know, you're missing it until you're out there. When you're out there, and I'm sure you experienced this in your travels, there's, there's a certain detachment from the masses, like just just just to be out of the hive and the influence of all the people around you. As weird as it seems, there's this energy that we're all exchanging and these giant hives together and some people live off of it like those New York City people like my friend Jeff lives in New York City is always going to live in New York City. This is what I like. He likes it. I love it. He's walking through the street punk. Bam, Bam. Yes. That's his thing. To me, I'm like, wow, I'm always my. My thought is always, how do you guys do this? How do you guys do this?

Speaker 6:          01:45:59       That's all I ever think. How the fuck do you guys do this for him is how could you live any other way, but the people that. But he has got a good life, so he's got. He enjoys what he does. He's a fulfilled life. He's happy, but if you didn't think were talking about the same thing I'm talking about. Jordy, have you ever had got it? Nepal. Oh, it hurts. Rough. Your farts smell really interesting when you might've got a. got a too bad because I have a friend who got really bad where he's sick in the hospital for like two days.

Speaker 4:          01:46:29       Yeah. I didn't go to the hospital by that point. I had been traveling for a few years. You already. I've had hepatitis. I mean I've had some. I've had to, you know. Yeah. I spent three days in a room in Polinsky shitting and puking into the same plastic bag. Oh boy. Three days in the same

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       bag. What is it like after day three? If you had the worst enemy? It was day one. Matthew. On the third floor. There's worst enemy was just standing there smoking a cigarette. Would you drop that bag on the mother? Mercy. Mercy. I don't have any enemies that. Yeah, you'd have to really hate somebody for that. One of the funniest thing about that was I came out of that room after I. It might've been two days. I don't know, but it came out of that room, you know, Pale, emaciated, just totally drained and I went out on the terrorists of this Pelinka ever been there. Oh, amazing. Mayan Ruins and lots of magic mushrooms. Once I hit one to teach an Eatsa, a teaching school teaching, he says, much more sort of commercialized only case. Pretty wild stuff. Taloon was another one that's out on its own or is that my hands mindset?

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       Both money. Anyway, I come out and there's this woman there, this German woman, and we start chatting a little bit and she, and this was at a time in my life where I was really nervous around women and whatever, and this woman was like super into me and I was like, I was like, I could not fuck you. Like I just, there's no, I didn't do much. I just saw it was, felt so sick and horrible and it turned out later. I got to know her a little bit. She was really into punk music and she thought I looked like johnny rotten. So she thought you were cute because you looked at John Ross. I looked like I was about to die. That was the end of that. Look for people out there that you might go camping. Please just get a gravity filter. Don't get Giardia.

Speaker 3:          01:48:24       You can. It's really easy. It's real and there's also a thing called a steri pen. Steady parents. Wonderful. Take the Steri pen. You run it around in the water for a certain amount of time and it kills everything bad in the water and you even taste it doesn't taste any different. It's literally like UV light. There's a bunch of like stereo pens, a good one, but these gravity filters are amazing and they have pumps. They have another one. You can take some water and you pump it, you pump it and it goes through the filter into your water bottle and you can drink it. You can clean up all like 99 point nine, nine percent of all the bullshit with just a good filter and it doesn't. You don't have to drop the chemicals in there. Some people bring those. Yeah, I have a tablet and stuff like that, but you don't need to, but please don't drink at a creek folks.

Speaker 3:          01:49:08       It could be dead yards up. I don't know if you. If you pull this up, I just recently I read a thing online saying that like it's almost never necessary to filter your water when you're in when you're camping, and I've always filtered my water camping, but it was this thing where they did all these. They took all these samples of creeks from creeks and and like apparently they're like self correcting mechanism nature, but if something's dead hundred yards up, you're fucked. If you don't want that, it's not worth it. The gravity filter so fucking easy. It's like if you. You could take the risk and shit your brains out for three days or you can just enjoy with water

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       from the same place. I think shitting your brains out for three days is a good experience. Yeah. It's like an ordeal. Poison, right? Yeah. Do you ever get high from vomiting? No. Have you? Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Because when you vomit, you get all these endorphins. You don't feel great after you vomit. I felt better. Yeah, go with gray. It's true. I'm relatively great. Last time I did some serious vomiting because I had food poisoning, but I guess I was about 10 years ago I had some pretty serious food poisoning. It was just hurl anatomy. That was the last real, real like unstoppable. Yeah. Well it's just coming out and just a fat tube of it. You ever have a colonic irrigation? No, not into things going in my, but I don't believe. I don't believe that that is necessarily a healthy thing either. I don't believe it's not that it's, but this all the stuff that people saying that it's healthy for you.

Speaker 2:          01:50:46       I'm like, I don't necessarily think it is a while about that. You know, I sent you an email about him. Actually, he's. He's like, you know what? I am the big beard. He's a fan of yours. Oh, okay. Yeah, I was. I was with him in Tucson and he, he saw, he's an old friend of Paul stamets. He was at Harvard. Yeah, I can. I'll hook you up. He is. He ever comes to La. He's, he was the most famous doctor in America for years. He, he, um, but he's really interesting because he was at Harvard with leary. He studied under Richard Evans. Shelties is undergrad degrees in botany. Richard Evans, shelties as the guy who basically discovered in Camas, hundreds of psychoactive plants in the Amazon, you know, amazing dude. Anyway, um, so andrew was right in the mix and he sort of was central in leary getting in trouble because Andrew wrote an article in the Harvard Crimson criticizing leary for indiscriminately giving psilocybin to students.

Speaker 2:          01:51:51       And that's what triggered the Tom after that. Anyway, Andrew went onto Harvard med school, residency at mass, this mass general in Boston, like top top flight academic stuff, but instead of he got his md but then he went and worked at the National Institutes of health in Bethesda, Maryland, the main government research center. So like early seventies I think. And he has never wavered in his understanding that drugs are not necessarily bad. And so he did these double blind studies about marijuana. The first, I believe double blind studies of marijuana where he said like, okay, you know, people have tested marijuana and they say, oh, it's bad for your brain because what they do is they get people high who've never been high and then they give them a bunch of math questions and they have trouble. I can answer them whenever he's like, I've been high, I don't want to do math when I'm high, so let's test people on things they like doing when they're high, like color perception or pattern recognition or ability to recognize tonal changes in music, things like that.

Speaker 2:          01:53:03       And he found that their perceptions were actually heightened. So it's like, ah, see, marijuana is not bad. It's just bad for certain things and not others. So then he did, um, I think it was about driving. We said, okay, they find that marijuana impacts impairs driving ability, but that's again, because they're using naive people who've never been high before and they don't have a chance to practice driving while high. So he got people let them practice, let them get used to being high. Then he tested their driving ability versus what it had been before or when they're not stone and average scores and all that, and he again, he found that when people had a chance to practice, they drove fine. There's no problem. He got basically pushed out because he was finding, you know, he was demonstrating that it's not necessarily a bad thing.

Speaker 2:          01:53:51       Yeah. It's one of those things that we talked about before. Sometimes people don't want to know the actual results. They just want to know the results that jive with their understanding of this is really dangerous in science because people are purporting to be objective and sign off and they're not. And it's not fair. It's not fair to all the people that were unjustly arrested and prosecuted and imprisoned for something that's very beneficial. And they were saying a lot of them saying that they like it, saying that it does good things for them. You know, it's not the end all cure all, but there's not a goddamn thing it is, but it's certainly a tool. Right. And look at it objectively, what, what's the ratio of benefit to danger? Right. You know, how many people have died from marijuana overdose? Zero ever. Right? And so Andy Wilde has been saying this since the seventies and his first book is called the natural mind that he wrote the marriage of the sun and the moon than a book called from chocolate to morphine.

Speaker 2:          01:54:48       These are all big stretch, but chocolate is a drug, right? Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. And the marriage of the sun and the moon. Each chapter is about a mind altering substance or experienced. So vomiting is one chapter in there. Cocaine, mushrooms. So he and Paul stamets had been buddies for 35 years. There's, does that have anything to do with bulemia? Does bulemia also like something where people are getting addicted to actual throwing up? Yeah. And there are religions where people vomit every morning in India. I think Gandhi vomited every morning. Jesus Gandhi and he drank his own pissed by the way. Way to go. Yeah. So anyway, Andy Weil is this kind of hippie doctor dude with all the drugs and all that, and the big white beard. And then he, um, he became very famous in the eighties with books about alternative medicine, but he goes complimentary medicine because he's not saying Western medicine's bad, he's

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       saying it's good for some things, not the best approach to other things. So he brings in Ayervetic and Chinese and all these different traditions, depending on what the issue is. He became very mainstream, huge mega bestsellers on Oprah cover of Time magazine, you know, he started a school at the University of Arizona for doctors to get a certification in complimentary medicine. So He's super mainstream, successful, but he has never wavered on his stance on drugs. And so imagine the pressures that were coming on them believable. And he's like, no, fuck it. The seventies and the eighties. All that say no to drugs era. Here's a question that you'd probably know the answer to. Um, there are obviously killing untold numbers of rhinos for their horns because men want to grind them up and it's supposed to get your dick hard. Does that work for me? Did you try it and have it out there killing rhinos on the snake pit forever?

Speaker 3:          01:56:48       You know, is there any science to that? No, not that I'm aware of. That is the craziest genocide ever. And who's doing it? It's not Africans who think it's gonna make their dicks hard. It's Chinese. It's Asian people that apparently have a. What I was told is that it's not even necessarily just about the idea that it gets your dick hard, but there is value in the fact that it's a forbidden thing that's very difficult to acquire. I think that's. I think it's a signaling. It's like a Rolex watch or a Lamborghini or whatever. It's like what my friend told me it was that it's not just a signaling, but it's a signaling that you don't give a fuck. Like you're, you're here to make money and get the best and have the best things. And look what's, let's drink rhino t and then we're gonna eat shark fin soup.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       Ha can live. Monkey brain. Have you seen that? I've seen that. That's really intense. That's real. I've sought in um, a faces of death. A bunch of people sitting around there whacking a monkey in the head with a hammer and his head stuck in this little thing, but I was in the table. Yeah. I wasn't really sure if that was real and they scoop it out. And you didn't. Yeah. Rattlesnake brains though, isn't that like prions? Can you get prions from primate brains? Like you can. You could be deathly ill from that. Right? Like that's essentially what mad cow diseases. Yeah. Yeah. From brains. Chow, forcing cows, eat cows. That's where mad cow disease comes from, which is a body mind couldn't give blood because he was in England. He lived in England during the time that the mad cow. I was in Spain then. Yeah. I can't give blood because of the hepatitis A. Which one did you get? A, B or c? A. Is that a good one? Yeah, that's the, that's the one is easy one. Oh yeah. It was like a month down yellow eyes, like no energy a month. That was,

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       yeah. That, uh, that's a long story, but that, that I actually got it from a guy who was sort of saving me from something else that I, they never told you the whole Scorpion and Guatemala story. I think he did. But tell me again. Well, it's a long story. Yeah. I mean, I don't know though. People will be well feel like they're getting now people can hear it. I, I've told her it on my podcast and I've also, I told her it on a podcast called risk and that's actually cliff notes. Uh, yeah, but listen to the risk thing, if anyone wants to hear the whole thing because they added sound effects and it's really good. What is risk? It's a, it's a podcast or just, it's a storytelling thing, you know, it's like the moth, it's that kind of thing. And they added sound effects.

Speaker 2:          01:59:24       Yeah. They produced it really well. Yeah. As well to. Yeah. What happened was I was, I was with my girlfriend at the time, Puerto Rican, super beautiful Puerto Rican girl, and she tried to get you to go to a camp away and talk about Jesus or no, she never tried to talk to me about Jesus, but I would have listened because she was interested in how the APP. No, she was great. Um, so I was with her in Guatemala and uh, we had met this other couple, solange and Fabrizio and um, yeah, we were at this place called t carl in North East Guatemala, way, way back in the jungle and it's a mayan ruins, beautiful, crazy, you know, it was like a big city and now they're, you know, when I was there, this was 1989, there were maybe 10 big ruins, big temples that they had uncovered.

Speaker 2:          02:00:19       And we're staying in this campsite with hammocks. It was very primitive at the time. Anyway, uh, we, it was a full moon and on, and I decided we were going to take some acid and watch the moon rise and the sun set up from the top of symbol for, it's called the Jaguar temple. And so we went up with this other couple and there's this ledge up there and it's up above tree line, you know, you're way above the tree line. You can see the monkeys, the monkeys and, and like see out over this flat jungle Putin, I think it's called. And um, so we're up there and the sun's sinking and the moon is rising and the moon comes up. It's beautiful. And, and there's this big bank of storm clouds and the full moon is like between the horizon and the storm clouds.

Speaker 2:          02:01:11       But then it starts to go up behind these clouds and you can see it's going to get dark as fuck. Right? So this other couple were like, yeah, we're going to go back to the campsite. They didn't know we were tripping. Right. And we timed it. So we were peeking like now you know, and so they're going to go back to the campsite. So we, but we were like, yeah, we're gonna just hang here. Right. So I went over to hold the flashlight for them as they went down this ladder and was like maybe a 30 foot ladder pipe ladder drilled into the temples, made out

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       of limestone blocks. And so to get up there. Yeah, there you go. Before. So we're at steep. Yeah. Is that climbed up at temple for though? I mean, uh, the, the Jaguar temple. I typed in temple for Jaguar. Oh, okay. Cool. Yeah, yeah. When I was there was much more overgrown. Yeah. Anyway, so we, we went up to the top of that. Looks like if they're on the right. Yeah, that looks like it from like when we were there anyway. So we're up on that ledge there and, and see how flat the jungle is. Just goes forever. It's so crazy how it's almost like uniform and height. Yeah. I mean just very, very little bit, but. Oh look at that picture. Yeah. Yeah. Oh Man. It looks like a picture I took actually up there. Anyway, so looking. It's so beautiful. So we're up there and uh, and I'm holding the ladder for these guys going down and they're like, okay, we're good.

Speaker 4:          02:02:43       I'm like, okay. I turned off the ladder and I take a step and fuck. Oh, what the fuck was that? I turned the flashlight back on. See the Scorpion going up the wall, stirring up the wall like four inches green, and then they're like three other ones on the wall and say, fuck this things crawling with fucking scorpions. And I just got stung on the toe while you're on acid while I'm tripit and thank God I didn't jump because I would have dropped 30 feet to fucking rocks. Oh my gosh. So I go back to Anna and she said, what happened to you? I said, I just fucking Scorpion. Like, watch out. And like, oh, Jesus, right? Oh my God. So we're kind of like, oh, are they dangerous? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So I'm now it's getting dark, right?

Speaker 4:          02:03:29       Because the moon's going behind these clouds and there's this other, these two dudes like way over on the other side of the ledge and we go over to them and they're Italian and they don't speak English, but he spoke Spanish, so she was talking to them in Spanish and Italian and you sort of understand, you know, they're both Latin, similar languages and those guys are like, ah, I don't know. And we were like, watch out because they're all around like, oh shit. Yeah. So while we're talking to them now it's totally dark. This Guatemalan dude comes up the ladder with an old bolt action rifle and he's like the night guard or something. So we go over to him and honest as to him in Spanish is in some Scorpio and they got, are they dangerous? The Scorpions and the guy says csun like Dolly's, I'm worth those. They're lethal. There are deaths. Like, ah, fuck man, I understood enough Spanish to get that. You're thinking you're dying. So I'm like, this. Is it? April, full moon of April 1989. Yeah, I was 27. It was right around time of trump's plane

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       crashed. What if it was exactly the same? I think. Talk about being curious in your life. Yeah. Yeah. I was at a table that Puerto Rican girl while you were would that other Puerto Rican girl up there? Puerto Rican girls crossed our paths. Both survived. She was barely. So what happened to you? So I'm thinking like, fuck, I gotta get down from here because there's no way anyone else could carry me down these ladders and you couldn't get a stretcher down. Right? So if I'm going to survive, I got to get down on my own quickly. So then if I collapse they can get an ambulance. Although we're like, you know, two days from Guatemala City and whatever the town was, I don't even know if they had a clinic or I don't know, but we were pretty remote and I'm like, they're not going to send out a helicopter or some shit like that.

Speaker 2:          02:05:28       Right. So, uh, I get down. I. Oh, so what happens is my girlfriend's freaking out. No, no criticism of her. I think it's much harder to watch someone you love die than to die yourself and in this case. And so she's like, Oh fuck, you're dying. And I'm thinking, Gee, uh, maybe. And so the one of the Italian dudes was like, look, you guys go, I'll stay with her and you know, make sure she's all right. And so I go down with his other Italian dude. We go down the ladder and we get down to the floor and we start walking around the jungle and it's fucking totally dark now because the moon's totally obscured. And the jungle, you know, when you're tripping, you're, your pupils are super dilated so you can see light and stuff that normally you might miss. Like the jungle in Guatemala was full of glowing worms and shit flying by.

Speaker 2:          02:06:22       It's all like green and blue and. Yeah. Yeah. And they're like these caterpillars and like, Holy Shit, this place is wild. So we're walking around, lost. Totally dark tripping. I'm tripping. He doesn't know. I'm tripping. How, how trip and are you tripping? That was three head nods, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, you know, I'm peeking from the acid plus all the adrenaline, right? And so this pain is running up my leg and as it's like running up my, the bone in the center of the leg, just kind of fire. And when it gets to the top of muscles, seize up, you know, my from the knee down, it's just like rigid. And then my tongue starts swelling and my throat starts swelling. And I got this like novacane feeling in my lips and I'm sort of drooling and um, and I'm thinking when this gets to my heart, that's when I die.

Speaker 2:          02:07:21       And so I'm, I'm with this guy and we're lost. And, and at first like I'm freaked, I'm scared and then it occurs to me that I'm saying my last words to a guy whose face I've never seen because we didn't shine the light in his face when we're talking to him and he doesn't understand English. And that cracks me up that I just, I start laughing like a fucking maniac and he's like, got his arm around me. He thinks I'm like losing it. And I'm just like, this is hilarious. And I think about my friends and how they're going to be like, yeah, you know, good on Chris, you know, he, he didn't die in some dumb ass way. Like we all thought he would get. He died in this. It's still a dumb ass way, but at least it's interesting. And then I started thinking, you know, all right, I'm 27, but I've been around the world.

Speaker 2:          02:08:20       I literally around the planet, I've been in love. I've had sex with gorgeous women who loved me, who, you know, I've, Wa, I, I made a shit ton of money. I walked away from it. I, I've done, I've done everything I wanted to do. I'm 27, but I've done everything and I've had a fucking amazing life. Wow. And this is cool. I would have been crying like a bitch, I believe. No, you know, I felt really bad for my parents and, and Ana. But for myself, I was like, I've had a good fucking run. It's not as long as I would've liked, but I've had a good fucking run. So I really came to this piece and like, the world doesn't owe me shit, man. I've had. I mean, I had been in Alaska two summers at that point. I worked in New York in Manhattan for two years at that point with a guy who offered me a million dollars if I would stay.

Speaker 2:          02:09:25       And I said No. And I left. I flew to India. I had been in Asia for two years. You've said no to a million bucks when I was 26. Why did you say no to the million bucks? What was the catch was you need to do to, you know, he was a really good guy actually. Uh, I liked him a lot. The million bucks was, he said when you're 30 you'll have a net worth of a million dollars and if you don't, I'll write you a check for the whatever you're missing and we'll notarize it and this guy's worth $30,000,000 or something. So he just wanted you to work for him. He wanted me to stay and I wanted to go. I wanted to see the world and this guy hired me to help him manage his family's property in midtown Manhattan and the main reason he hired me is because I didn't give a shit about money, so he knew I wouldn't steal from him. Ah, that's interesting. And then when it stopped being fun and knew, I was like, I got to go. He's like, no, no, stick around. I'll make it worth your while. And so there was this weird dynamic. But anyway, I had all these experiences and so I would wear a piece. I like, Hey, I've had a good run. So

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       anyway, we finally, we, we come out into this little parking lot and there's this Guatemalan kid there maybe 10 or something and the Italian guy talks to him and says, Scorpion, Scorpion. And the kid looks at me like, oh my God, come, come. And he takes us to this trailer and we bang on the door and this horrible fluorescent light comes on. And this like Guatemalan Dude who obviously had been drunk and asleep, you know, it was like the kid says he's the doctor. He's not a doctor. He's some jungle dude, whatever, and the, so the guy takes us in and he's talking, you know, it's sort of Saki, broken English, and I explained to him, he says, how big is the Scorpion? He looks at my foot. He says, how big was the Scorpion? I say, yeah, like this big, like a finger and what color?

Speaker 3:          02:11:19       Gray, green sort of. And he says, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not a scorpion. That's electron. So in Spanish and that part of Guatemala. Anyway, they're two different words. A squat beyond is a little red thing. Electron is a big green thing, but they're both with the tail and the, you know. And uh, so we had been using the word Scorpion because in English that's all there is. But Scorpion, Scorpion in that part of Guatemala is lethal and that's a little tiny thing. That's a little red thing and that'll fucking take you out. But the guys like, look, you're still, this was two hours ago and you're still alive. You'll be fine. Apparently it's like if you have a bad heart or you're a kid, maybe this will kill you. But if you're, if you survive a couple hours, you're going to be speaking to something I've read today.

Speaker 3:          02:12:12       Something about the Atkins Guy. This is an interesting story. You know, the Atkins Diet. It's very controversial because diet is a lot of protein stuff. Um, I had heard that the guy died of a heart attack and that they weren't being completely honest as apparently even snopes says it's not clear the guy had, he felt like he was the head of like, it's so weird when this happens. The Atkins Diet Guy, when he died, he weighed 258 pounds, so he was overweight and he was 72 years old. And the story was that he slipped on ice in front of his house and hit his head. Um, but he also had a history of heart disease. I did not know that. And he had had heart attacks. Is that why he got into the research that led to the Diet? I don't know. I don't know. Just read that today. I'm like, there's some conspiracy in was it was a Vegan guy who was talking about it, but there's a conspiracy about adkins and that Atkins really died from a heart attack, which would ruin the brand when that found he was 258 pounds. I was like, wait, how weight? That's heavy. How tall was he? The report concludes, uh, Dr Atkins 72 at a history of heart attack and congestive heart failure and notes that he weighed 258 pounds at

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       death. Yeah. So he was really unhealthy, which is really interesting because that whole diet, the Atkins Diet, like a lot of people were really criticizing that diet and saying that it's really terrible and all the fat and all this stuff to all the protein you eat, you really shouldn't eat that much. But it's very similar to what a lot of people are eating now when they're eating Paleo and they're eating low carb. Apparently. The real problem within our read this today about fat, high fat diets is if you're going to eat a high fat diet and must be a low carb diet as well, you cannot have high, high fat and carbs that is really bad for you because your body's going to use all the carbohydrates for fuel and all the fat that you eat. It's just going to be stored and apparently that combination, especially with saturated fats is very bad.

Speaker 6:          02:14:26       So you want to be ketogenic or or you want to be close to it, you know, you wanna, you essentially want to eliminate most of the stuff that people love. Pizza and bread and pasta eliminate almost all that stuff. That's just all those unnatural foods, but the point being that I'd never heard that. I've always heard that he had fallen and I'd assumed that anything other than that would be a conspiracy theory, but then I read that and I was like, whoa. You know who wrote it? Now remember John Joseph from the Cro mags. You know that guy's a Vegan, super healthy, ultra marathon, a triathlon dude. Now he used to be. We still is lead singer, the chromatics. I think they're still around. I know he tore. Still might be torn on his own now, but he wrote that about Atkins today. I was on.

Speaker 4:          02:15:17       Yeah. Well, just to tie this together. The guy after he explains this to me, he gives me a couple pills, probably aspirin or something and he dip some water out of a bucket and says, take these pills. You'll be fine. I'd been traveling a long time. I knew you don't drink water out of a bucket and the tropics, but this guy just told me I wasn't going to die, so I'll do whatever the fuck he says. And I drank the water and a week later and hepatitis.

Speaker 6:          02:15:43       Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:15:44       You got the hepatitis hepatitis from a bucket of this dude had laying around as dirty shed. That's crazy. Exactly. And that's. You narrowed it down to that particular moment that you got hepatitis, but I assume, I mean that's a pretty high risk for. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking crazy people with their guts

Speaker 6:          02:16:03       biome down there. You know, they can. It's like if you see other animals drink out of a puddle, do you freak out?

Speaker 4:          02:16:11       No. Yeah, like a dog drinks out of public, you know, freak out because the dog's got bodies going to handle that. Well, that's what Jeff Leach was telling me about the Hudson. They drink right out of mud puddles all the time. It's like, you know, that's why he wanted their microbiome. Yeah. Yeah. We have a weak ass bitch ass preservative laden microbiome

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       antibiotics. You can avoid them. It's hard to stay alive, you know, if you get really, really, really sad. No, I'm not talking about medical. I'm talking about in the food supply, the water supply. They're everywhere in America. I don't know if that really affects us that much. They. One of the things that I was. I don't think there's levels of antibiotics in the water supply that's really affecting us. It's possible that some of it is getting to us in the food supply, but more so than not, I think the issue is poor dietary choices because poor dietary choices are the number one factor and what affects your microbiome. Super Low fiber, low fiber. Just not just not eating healthy. If you're eating a lot of sugar in particular, you've got candida running around your gut and they, the unhealthy bacteria reacts better to that and your body starts craving it.

Speaker 3:          02:17:20       That's one of the weirdest things about when you do eat a low carb diet is your body's really doesn't crave carbohydrates anymore. It's like it's a trick, but when you're on carbohydrates, if you eat them a lot and your body's craving them all the time, it's like you are being influenced by those organisms that are in your digestive tract, which is really freaky. Yeah, I mean that's the whole sort of super organism. I think you and I've talked about that in the past, the idea that w toxoplasmosis you know about that she says these things that get into the brain and determine behavior and from the gut as well can determine. I mean, not even something as simple as a simple example of like wanting, wanting the organism to crave the thing that, that, that works for them, but not for the organism, but man, that weird, like really complex behaviors that are created by some parasites in the brain, you know, like cats that are, are mice that aren't afraid of cats and are actually attracted to the smell of cat piss.

Speaker 3:          02:18:22       Sexually attracted. Yeah. They get turned off. It's crazy. And that, that bacteria or this toxoplasmosis can only grow and it can only reproduce inside a cat's gut. Right? Which is fucking bananas. Like Paul Ski, we, Paul, Ski Roberts, he's great and he went into depth about that and it's just, it's one of those things where you just stop and go. What? He's a cool guy. I remember mentioning him to you once on this podcast and Jamie brought up is his photo and you looked at his photo and you said there's a guy who does not give a fuck if you look at it was crazy fucking hair ponytail. He's homeless. He's just, he's interested in the work here yet. Yeah. Yeah. The work, yeah, but he was gracious enough to give us an hour there. He is right there for a super nice guy too, but just A. I mean his work with baboons as well. It was covered in a radiolab podcast is fascinating podcasts with the observed like this baboons is temporary baboo in utopia where. Yeah, you and I talked about that where the upper ranking males

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       eight, the contaminated meat and died out. Yeah. I love that story. It's one of the only hopeful fucking stories out there.

Speaker 5:          02:19:36       Well, I feel like there's certain pockets of humanity like, I mean I've never been to burning man, but I assume that that's sort of a representation of that as well. Certain pockets of humanity were likeminded people get together and they say, well, it doesn't have to be like this, like just because we're all caught up in this crazy trap and I think more of those little pockets of humanity are popping up day in, day out. I think this podcast represents that and a lot of way to, you know, we're talking about the podcast being a cult of its own creation in in some way, but I think it's more of a community. Well no one's asking you to do anything and there's no, there's no, you know, there's no rules, but it's, it's an opportunity for likeminded discussion that's rarely present in cubicle life.

Speaker 4:          02:20:23       When I think about, I mean podcasts are in the intro to this, this podcast book we were talking about earlier, I said that I think that podcasting is on a par with the invention of the printing press in terms of the potential for radical social change because there's no, like you said before, there's no filter. There's nothing between you and your audience and that's a radical thing. I mean the printing press said w when the printing press came about, what that meant was you didn't need to have a team of scribes to copy out this thing that you've written. Right? Right. So you can be just a regular guy and pay the thousand bucks or whatever the equivalent of that was in medieval Europe. And have all these pamphlets printed so you could be Martin Luther and change the world if you have a good idea and it takes hold. Podcasting seems similar to that in in, in the sense that anybody who can afford a few mikes in a laptop can get their message out and if it catches fire, it catches fire it and it goes around the world.

Speaker 5:          02:21:33       You could do it on a phone to look. We're saying you don't really need a whole lot of equipment. A lot of people use one of those small mp3 Mike's a zoom.

Speaker 4:          02:21:40       We use that early on. I still use a zoom. Yeah, I

Speaker 5:          02:21:43       see. I think maybe I think you probably. You're onto something. I think the Internet in general and the ability for people to just create their own content, that's the real. The gatekeepers to the masses have always been these production companies, content provider's networks, all these people, the hallowed halls and those people all got fat on it and a weird way because the gatekeepers are the ones that hoarded all the money and then they gave some of the money to the actors and some of the money to the writers and everybody got wealthy, don't get me wrong, but the gate, the Harvey Weinsteins of the world is the one that really got rich. If you look at that guy like that guy is the guy that really got rich and really happy to, oh, he's doing really well. He's doing super. That's great.

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       He, I mean obviously that guy's the worst example, right? But he obviously also on a positive note, financed a lot of amazing movies and if, if it wasn't for him, they wouldn't have gotten done. But clearly those people that do that, there are different thing. They're business people now is the first time ever that there's a direct connection between a guy like you and a guy like whoever's listening to this right now, that's never happened before. I mean the only one in the room, you know, we have Jamie helping out and then it goes to the server and then it's uploaded to the rss feed and then it goes to itunes and it goes to wherever the fuck you're getting your podcast from and that's it. There's no steps. There's no network, there's no notes, there's no production. Meaning if you did your podcast and your podcast was on some radio network somewhere, you'd have to go to meetings, weekly meetings with the studio.

Speaker 6:          02:23:20       He'd have some fucking program director, some Dick. Fuck asshole wants to tell you what to talk about anymore. Yeah. Look, you're losing. You're losing sponsors. I don't even have advertisers. Good for you. I do it. I had him for awhile and I just got tired of listening to myself talking about underwear and shit. So just do it for fun. No, no. It's supported through patriot. That's great to have people send me money. This is what I think ultimately I think ultimately people will. Someone's going to develop some sort of an app thing where you can. You can like have basically everything you put out your podcast blogs, although it would all be cut like a channel, you could even call it channel and that would be like a new social media platform that you could do everything from, you know, and people could either sign up for it and pay for it or not, you know, that's how Sam Harris has it.

Speaker 6:          02:24:15       You can either pay for his podcast or not. That's how you have it too, right? Yeah. Although you get it for free. Yeah. You get it for free. So if you want to support, if you want to support it. Okay. You pay and I do some, uh, some bonus stuff for Patriana only. Yeah. Sam does. It could be a buck a month, you know? Yeah. Why not? And I think there's, the future's probably going to be something like that. That's the present, as you said. I mean, Sam's doing it. Dunkin's got a Patriot on thing. I do. You got to get a Patriot on Joe. No, I make some money. I make plenty of money with ads. I don't. I'm trying to think of like what. It's almost like give the option if you pay, you get no ads or a free. A lot of people do that.

Speaker 6:          02:24:56       That's good. Dan Savage does that. He has the. I forget what it's called, but yeah, there's the ad free version and the. That's probably a good month, if that makes sense, because that way if you don't want to pay for it, you don't have to, but the point being that you can reach a whole lot of people, forget about paying. You can reach a whole lot of people and get ideas to a whole lot of people that you could just never reached before. No one would let you. Why would anybody invest in you? Why would they even put that time in and then you're going to keep all of it a lot.

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       No Way. When you think about publishing now, right? I write a book that bill comes out. Somebody buys a copy of sex at dawn. Right now in paperback, I get eight point two, five percent of the. Of the price. That's minus 15 percent of that. That goes to my agent and then taxes. That's Hilarious, right? I mean a pimp, let's a hooker keep 50 percent of the money. Wow. A stingy pam. What is a gate lady like? J Dot k dot rowling's when she's balling on top of the world kind of deal as she get. What depends what she signed, you know, but I mean she's already like Stephen King. People that occur, they can cut a totally different deal, but the standard contract is what I had, which was, you know, eight percent on hard copy. It's eight percent for 5,000 copies, then 10 percent, 5,012 percent after that in hard copy.

Speaker 4:          02:26:17       And then paper bag is eight point two, five percent forever. How many books have you sold in America? Maybe $400,000. Four hundred 50,000, something like that. It's a lot of books. Not really. Not really. I mean it's 20 languages. That's what's cool. It's worldwide filled with 400,000. It's a lot of books. If you look at it that way, that's how you have to learn what it really is. But in terms of money, it's not that much money, especially if you, you know, stretch it out over the years it took to write it and all the promotion and all that. It's not a way to make a lot of money writing books. Even it used to be, if you had a New York Times bestseller back in the day, you've made a lot of money really. But the reading audience is much smaller now than it was 20, 30 years ago.

Speaker 4:          02:27:03       What about books on cassette or audio? That's a different deal. You signed a deal generally with audible, they sort of own that market which is an Amazon company, right? And uh, yeah, you get, I forget what the percentages, but it's probably 18 to 20 something like that. And also, um, ebooks you get a slightly better deal. I think you get 17 and a half percent of the price of an Ebook, which is funny though because it's not costing the publisher anything additional to have an Ebook, it's already edited, it's already the cover and all. It's already done and there's no distribution cost. So you get 17 and a half percent as a writer, they get the rest. That's so crazy. There's no trucks, there's no shelf, there's no store, no reason for them to be getting all that money. That's so crazy. It's all gravy for them.

Speaker 4:          02:27:54       Yeah. And it's not like they're recouping costs and it used to be like back in hemingway or whatever, back in the day a publisher would, would support an author through three, four or five books, thinking eventually something's going to hit. This guy has got talent eventually and so it was an investment. Now they expect you to have your own platform, your own access to media. You sometimes they're asking authors to hire their own editors, their own publicists, right? Really? Yeah. But they still get all the money. They still get the same contract that the ratios are the same. So it's like. Yeah, that's why I say it's like a napster kind of thing. It's at the point now where it's like, wait a minute, if I got a platform, I got access to media, I'm hiring my own editor. Why? Why am I giving you creative control?

Speaker 4:          02:28:41       And Ninety two percent of the fucking revenue. It's a strange business. That is a strange business. Now essentially what they have is credibility. So if you self publish or publish with some independent publisher, The New York Times isn't going to review it or won't know. Wow. Because it's a very insular world. Well that's crazy. If it's a book that takes off, then a publisher will come in and buy. So like 50 shades of gray. That was self published. I wonder why. Yeah. But look what happens. Yeah. They found they tapped into a market. A chick that let's get spit on. Right. There are a lot of them. There's a lot of them, I don't know about their hood on, but certainly joked. Yeah. Smacked around by a billionaire. Yeah. Good looking good looking guy with a heart of gold. Gold. But it likes to spit in your mouth.

Speaker 4:          02:29:32       Yeah. And then she. And then ultimately he'll see the light and of course he'll be taking course. That's fantasy. That's the fairy tale. That's what everybody wants. So you. That's why I was saying earlier, I've got this idea, I was talking to Duncan about this the other night. I've got this idea to write an erotic memoir, but that'll sort of be like my last book because at that point I'll have burned all the bridges. You'll be the only person who would ever interviewed me after that. I think I was planning for it to come out around my 60th birthday and it it'll be called an old manifesto.

Speaker 4:          02:30:12       It just changed the names of people. Oh No. I'm not worried about the people. I'm not gonna hurt anybody in the bush or it's more just about. You know, when people you fucked and people find out the truth. Dude, you're gonna become legendary. But it's true though, but it's not a book about how much I got laid. It's not. It's not a book about how cool I am. It's a book about the amazing things I've learned in sexual situations and that the world is so different from what people think. How so? There's just so many things going on that mainstream people can't imagine. Like, I mean, I was in college the first time a man told me he would be happy for me to have sex with his wife and it wasn't a Kinky, weird thing. It was like, I'm not doing it. She's wonderful. I noticed that you guys like each other. I just want you to know it's cool with me. Wow. That's the first time since then there's probably been, I don't know, half

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       a dozen or something. Um, mothers like, would you please have sex with my daughter? She is, she really, you know, there is a good one. Generally it's because she didn't like the boyfriend always. Yeah. So I was like, well, you show my daughter. Like there's a world out there that she doesn't know about. Yeah, there's always that. But then they recruit you and you got to take on the project. Well, you know, should you choose to accept it? Should you choose to accept it? They expect you to stick around as well. Not necessarily just the world's weird stuff that people think like, oh my God, if you know you have sex with someone's wife and he knows he's going to kill you, well maybe not. Maybe it'll take you out for a beer afterwards and you'll be friends. This is the subject of Arusha fears podcast this week with our, uh, with Aubrey Marcus and they're talking about open relationships and they get uber honest.

Speaker 5:          02:32:14       It's very intense. I think that we live and cultural patterns and that what we see around us, we replicate. I think there's a lot of evidence for that. If you just pay attention, forget about studies, just to look at how different people are in other parts of the world. People that are putting plates in their lips and rings through their noses. People that the way people tattoo themselves, the way people express themselves in dance, like human beings vary so wildly and what we accept when we don't accept. I was going to bring up Japan earlier. It's one of the more fascinating travel experiences I've had was going to Japan because when you go to Tokyo you realize like this is a completely different way of living. Like they have a completely different way of interacting on the streets. They have a completely different way that they have decorated their buildings completely.

Speaker 5:          02:33:02       Like I have tattoos. They told me I had to wear long sleeves at the gym. I had to go back and change my shirt. They don't accept expose tattoo associated with organized crime, so I had to go back and just. There's a lot of that like where you realize like this is a totally different way of living, but if I lived there I would live like these people. So the. The momentum of these patterns in these cultures gets established and then it takes something radical to lift them and to free people from these patterns and once they're free from these patterns, then they have a real opportunity to objectively assess the way they behave and whether or not this is the way they want to behave or the way they want to live or whether that just expect it to because of this unthinking culture.

Speaker 5:          02:33:47       Momentum. Think that's what podcasts is doing. The, the, the, the big thing with podcasts is that it's creating more narratives and it's creating more discussions about interesting subjects and more questions and discussions about like why we live our life a certain way. And if you live a regular life with regular people, what are the odds that you get a chance to sit down with a guy like you for three hours or a guy like Graham Hancock or go like, you know, fill in the blank. Well, the fascinating people that you are. I have talked to in our podcasts and then do these conversations get right in someone's head. Whether their earbuds on, whether at work typing some nonsense bullshit into some fucking forms they have to fill out because that's what they do for a living. That's what's different and that's never happened before. These I like no generation before.

Speaker 5:          02:34:40       The podcast generation had that option. You had Howard Stern, you had and it was always funny. You had art. Bell was always weird and then you had all the right wing Wacko dudes on am talk radio. The Michael Savages, you know the fucking rush limbaugh and you had all those people but you didn't. Yeah. You didn't have a guy who just talks about whatever he wants to talk about. You had to be like, well, Chris, before we give you this radio broadcast show what kind of a show you're going to do? You're going to do a left wing show. You're going to do a show on cooking. What are you going to do? Now? I'm going to talk about sex and tribes and about how I think monogamy is just a. it's just a cultural construct and really the way we evolved like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, you fucking hippie.

Speaker 5:          02:35:26       There's no money in that, like before you came to someone and said, hey, I'm going to write this book and it's going to sell about 400,000 copies and it's basically same. Monogamy is bullshit. What are you think? They'd be like, what the Fuck Outta here? No one's going to buy that. Everybody wants to be monogamous and have a picket fence and live in the same row of houses where everybody looks the same. Everybody's got this. Oh you have an in ground pool. You lucky bastard. You know the, what, what podcasts have done is expose why we accept things as fact and why we just chew it because everybody around us does it. We are such a massive product of our environment. You know, and I think when we were talking earlier about race and about race being a determining factor for ICU, like you don't really ever know.

Speaker 5:          02:36:19       You might know from studies, but you don't know until those people who have the high Iq have to live the lives of the people that had the low Iq and they have to have the same environment that they grow up. And the same fears and the same influences, negative and positive, then you'll know. And even then you won't know because there's so many determining factors like, you know, I know people that are just way fucking smarter than me. They're just smarter. I just know they are. They're just smarter. What is that? I don't know. Is it the amount of studying they've done? Is it the amount of knowledge they have? Is that the path that they're on is different than my path? Or is it just their fucking brain works better?

Speaker 4:          02:36:59       But also what do we mean by smarter? You know, I mean, I look at someone like you. Your discipline is a major factor in your success. So is that part of being smart? It's smart enough to understand the discipline as a worthwhile pursuit. That's what it is. So what

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       about someone who has a really high Iq that's sitting in a basement eating lots of ice cream and not doing what they want to do? That's not smart decision making for sure. Yeah. But it's very high Iq, right? So what do we mean for a hunter gatherer of these people in the Amazon? We're talking about who can identify 500 different kinds of plants at a glance and you know, the behavior of animals and all this stuff, but you give them an Iq test and they're like under 100 for sure. Well, I've had conversations with people that are brilliant, super brilliant people and science and they'll try to explain to me mixed martial arts and some fucked up cockamamie Wayne. I have to stop them. Stop. Okay. Right now you sound like a fucking moron and I know you're not a professor, but you're talking about something that I have a PhD, I have a phd and people fucking people up.

Speaker 3:          02:38:04       I understand it as good as anybody that's ever lived. So if you start talking nonsense about how to fuck people up, Oh, your Kung Fu instructor said that, oh fuck. I like Aikido. But I recognize that there's a lot of bullshit. There's a funding to practice. I mean, it's fun to be able to flip people around like that and it would be a great thing to know if you lived in feudal Japan and you lost your sword and someone was coming at you when you had one chance at glory. What I love about Aikido is how it translates into psychological and emotional stuff. So what we were saying earlier about how I don't engage with people who are emotionally triggered by sex at dawn. To me that's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I learned that kind of thing for my Quito. First of all, you don't need to engage.

Speaker 3:          02:38:49       Secondly, if you do engage, what's important is that you stay calm and centered and most of the time people burn themselves out. You don't even really need to. As long as you step out of the way, let people have what they need to have. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But yeah, as far as the fighting technique, it's not what you're going to pull up in the street. It's not, but it's just my point is that people who are brilliant and are geniuses in one aspect of life simply don't have enough time to accumulate the same amount of data about everything. Just don't sure whether it's, uh, about, you know, fill in the blank clock making or whatever the fuck it is. There's just like, there's things that people know that you're, you don't know and it doesn't make you stupid. It's just information. The differences between how you apply that information.

Speaker 3:          02:39:33       Like if you're a really smart person, you don't do shit with it, you're a moron. You might be a really genius person, but if your life is falling apart and it's all because of your shitty decisions and you've never tried to improve upon your thought process and just blame the whole world instead of yourself, you're a moron. Even if you're really good at taking Iq tests. That's it. I mean, I don't personally, I don't think that I'm particularly intelligent. I think that what I can do that a lot of people don't do is think outside the box and connect dots that other people aren't connecting, which is precisely because I didn't go to the right schools and I, you know,

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       in my twenties I went and fucked around the world for 20 years.

Speaker 6:          02:40:17       You don't have tenure that you're working for or anything that's going to keep you in, lie around and figure it out and I mean that's the people that get stuck in that. Even intellectuals, they get stuck in that trap of having to toe the line in terms of like. I mean, good luck trying to find a conservative professor. Wright W, four percent identify as conservatives in mainstream universities and colleges have some really ridiculously low number, might be 10 percent, whatever it is, but it's the vast minority. You know, if one, if you get one out a 10, you're super lucky. I think that's

Speaker 4:          02:40:55       again, what do we mean by conservative? It's so confusing because the older I get, the more I realized that the language. It's like one of those venn diagrams where there's language and there's reality and there's some overlap, but there's a lot that doesn't correspond, you know, I get into this a lot when people are talking about homosexuality and whether it's, you know, human nature or its culture or whatever, and it's like, first of all, what do we mean by homosexuality? I, you, and I've talked about this before, this tribe in Papa New Guinea where the boys suck as much dick as they can because they think that semen contains the essence of masculinity. And so it's like, to them that's not homosexual behavior, that's normal male developmental behavior and you know, we, we look at that and say, oh well that's gay, but they don't see it as gay. So again, it's, as you were saying, we replicate the behavior we see around

Speaker 6:          02:41:51       they have adult homosexuality or do they only have sex with kids?

Speaker 4:          02:41:57       I think it's only at least the only kind that's been reported by anthropologists because again, there's a filtering there, of course is younger boys with older boys. So it's the younger boys are given blow jobs to the older boys because that's the way to get stronger and more masculine scam.

Speaker 6:          02:42:18       Somebody pulled off one. We have got no way of doing things with my Dick. He pulls the grass skirt aside. Oh Shit. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. It's drums sucking. Dicks pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump. There you go. It's pretty crazy though. Again, like what we were saying earlier that you can have these pockets of culture that they're radically different than other places, but the people just adapt and conform to what's around them. And I think that's the case with human beings everywhere. I don't think it's just the people that live in New Guinea and it's not just the people that live in the Congo or live in woodland hills. It's people that live everywhere. It's just how human beings behave. And it's also

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       interesting to look at how the culture reflects the environment. Yes. Right. And Marvin Harris wrote about this cultural materialism, how, how a culture responds to an environment, sort of like how, you know Cacti live in the desert. There's a reason for that. You put a cactus in the jungle that dies immediately, right? It's adapted to an environment. So you've got desert cultures, right? You've got jungle cultures, so the culture actually grows in a way that fits that ecological environment. He, he was the first. I think he's the first person to figure this out. Certainly the first time I read it, like some island, some cultures are cannibalistic and others aren't. Right? Why is that? Like, I'd never thought about it, like why would the aztecs eat the, their victims, but the Christians didn't, but the Christians killed a lot more. They just left them to rot on the field.

Speaker 4:          02:44:03       Why is that? Is that the Aztecs are particularly evil or something? I don't know. Uh, he applied this prism to it and show that also in the South Pacific, there are some islands that were, the people are cannibalistic and other islands where they weren't. And so he looks at all these in when he figured out was that in the places where people are cannibalistic, there are no domesticated animals that eat different food than humans. So for example, you can't raise dogs for me because dogs eat what we eat, so it doesn't make sense. But you can raise goats because goats eat shit. Humans don't eat right. So in the places that are cannibalistic, there was no nothing they could domesticate for protein. So when he killed a human yatim because your protein starved. Wow. Isn't that crazy? So it's an ecological thing. The aztecs had no pigs, right? There was nothing they could domesticate. No cattle. They had turkeys, I think was the only time they had met from a person they killed. There were so psyched to not just going to let it go. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       They ever tell you that's the case with bears. The bears are all cannibals. Cannibals. It's really dark. My friend Jonathan saw a bore, a male bear kill a cub and then saw the female eat it. Oh, the female, the female chase the male way. And after he'd killed that, she was trying to eat it and she chased him away and then she ate it. Shader own cub. And he said he had heard that they did that before. But watching that in person. But they're all cannibal,

Speaker 4:          02:45:42       well, lots of, lots of mammal mothers will eat their young.

Speaker 5:          02:45:46       But these guys come out of the den looking for cubs. The, the spring bears, they do it for two reasons. They do it. One, they, they, they know now that it's not just to try to force the female and the Astros again, they used to think it was just that. But now they like if you shoot a bear, other bears will claim it as their since start eating it and you have to chase them off. Like they're, it's the world of a bear is so fucking hard scrabble and so fraught with peril and they have to, you know, you're talking about a 500 pound bear. How much do you have to eat every day? What do you have? Do you like 30 pounds of meat or something like moths and everything? Their machines, where they are is they clean the forest up of babies. They can't get away and any. There's no overpopulating when there's hikers. Yeah. Well they. Oh that's so rare. It's so rare and it's more black bears in his brown bears. When Brown bears kill people, it's usually because someone fucked up and came across a female with her babies and the females want to take any chances. She fucks you up. But when a blackberry too, it's more likely for predation.

Speaker 2:          02:46:55       Also a black barrel chased up a tree. A grizzly won't climb a tree.

Speaker 5:          02:46:59       Right? That's true. And a lot of times when the black bears are near people, the reason is because people have encroached on their their areas and then they started getting into eating garbage and they start getting into eating garbage. They become a real problem because they're smart and they realize like, wow, fucking chase after some deer when I could eat this dude's trash. And then how much does he does dude? Like they don't. They don't think about the problems with that. This is going to bring heat on the Klan, you know, they just fuck that person up.

Speaker 2:          02:47:24       I spent a lot of time thinking about bears in Alaska. You should. Yeah, I was working the first year. It's so stupid. I worked in this cannery in Kenai for like six weeks. Salmon, Salmon. Cannery. Yeah. And I was a 16 hours a day, seven days a week, just like full on, fucking busting it out because the fish are coming in and they got the lines around it and you know, um, and at night I would go back and sleep in my tent on this bluff where we were all camped out. And so, like, you know, after six weeks everything smelled like salmon, everything, my skin, my hair, my but everything. And uh, so after we left, when I was with these two other dudes and we were like, let's go to Mckinley and like hike for awhile and you know, go in the. And we're, we hitchhiked, we hitchhiked up to Denali and we were walking back this dirt road and this, this, a ranger came along and his truck and he stopped and he was this cool guy, you know, and he's like, Hey, you guys have been working? Like, yeah man. It's like, Yay. Where he'd been working at Canada. Yeah. And what do you, you're going to go hiking now, like, yeah, yeah. He said, do you realize that every bear within 20 miles of here can smell it? And you smell like food, like, oh yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Like getting the truck back. I probably saved your life more than the guy who saved you from the Scorpion and gave you hepatitis.

Speaker 2:          02:48:52       Fucked me up, man. He did. But the other guy really saved you. Dude bears and fish. Man. That's a crazy combination. And so the, the big bears have. Um, cody cody. I was out there. That's the whole deal is that they're just having fish each wales, the whales

Speaker 3:          02:49:08       eat everything. That's, that is, that's a bananas place to be, man. When you were going to 12 foot bears, I worked on a boat the second year I worked on a boat that was based at a Kodiak. Did you get to see a lot of them? Yeah. And around. Oh Man, I saw the bears. I saw orchids. I saw we were out in Prince William Sound Orchestra, the animal that I always point to that if they didn't exist and there was a legend of them, it will be way more fascinating than bigfoot. If somebody told you that there's some mammal that lives in the ocean and they communicate with each other through a complex series of sounds that we to this day can't understand and that there are several times they have accent. They have accents. Yeah. They have dialects. They leap through the air and smashed. They stay.

Speaker 3:          02:49:51       Stay together and pods for life in a very strong family bond if they didn't exist. If this was just like some big foot type myth, it would be way more interesting than bigfoot is bigfoot dude just wanders around the woods and it's because big foot looks like a human. Yeah. You know, so it's, it's that wild. It's the dog's fascinated by the wolf, you know, bright. Yeah, exactly. Right. That is exactly what it is. That, that could've been us. We would. You know about this genre of women who read bigfoot erotic literature. There's a lot of it. Yeah. You should write some jokes should. That should be my move. Maybe that's just what I really like. You can't like. I'll write a blurb for you for sure. Yeah. I blur the lines between erotica and just like horrible hunting, primal, like slaughtering slaughtering of villagers and then fucking the women. Like it'd be like some weird murder porn. Like he would a storm into some weird log cabin. You do that. He'll do that famous photo of you. You know, looking all bad ass and black and white. That's the background for the author. That's your author photo for sure. Drinks way too much coffee and it's getting me wet. Just thinking about it. Wow. You get wet.

Speaker 3:          02:51:03       Fifty six years old. Joe Got a little leakage by the way. Last week. Big, big event in my life. What have first prostate exam bitches. Oh, how was that? It was fabulous. Did it feel good? No, no, no, but. But everything. You look very healthy. Can I just say that right now? You look at and help. Last time I saw you, you and me and Duncan were here maybe three months ago. There was a moment. We're talking about something and you said, you know, go into yoga two days a week, can change your life, and you looked at me and I don't know that, that this was happening on your end, but in my end it felt significant. It was Chris, Chris, you know, just two yoga classes a week and change your life. And I started going to yoga and I feel much better. Oh, look at that.

Speaker 3:          02:51:50       That's why you're all healthy looking that in my, uh, my urologist. So I got to tell you about this urologist though. Okay. Super Cool Guy. What'd you give him? Four stars on Yelp. I give him five. Yeah. Uh, and in fact I've on beyond my podcast. Oh Wow. But he's hesitant to do it and I understand why he works for a big hospital and you know, he doesn't want to become a rock star, but we ended up hanging out in his office talking about this dude gave himself have a sec dummy. Oh, he's. He told me, he's like, that's how bad he didn't want to have kids.

Speaker 3:          02:52:26       He pried his dick hole open delay. He was just like, you know, I do it, I've done it. A lot of them, I want to see what I could do it, and he said, Yo, my wife wasn't into the idea, but she insisted that I have a colleague standing by in case I got into trouble, so that made sense. I did a guy who was going a little to the left to the left himself, fucking vasectomy. That is the most bad ass thing I think I've ever heard. Did he like what did he do with his feet? I don't know the position back here, way back contortionists and just digging in and he said, it's on this side of the scrotum. Maybe yours, Bro, not mine. Oh, you got yours. But that's what they will be proud of. I get the. They told me I had the biggest pipe.

Speaker 3:          02:53:11       Well, this data, they did tie my tubes. They said my never saw tubes like my. He said to me afterwards, he said, you got the prostate. Have a 20 year old. I love you brother. That's good. That's good to hear. Yeah, it was really funny. Where are you fixed? No, you're not. You're still shooting live loads. Who knows? Who knows how alive they are at this point. Now you got defects in your loads. Yeah. You get older, you get defects, right? Yeah. So do you really do look healthier? I'm not bullshitting. I saw that like instantly, so two yoga classes a day or a week or a week day of crazy, but we come in here to make it, but to a week really can change your life. Yeah, and I'm doing the like old lady classes to those old ladies are tough as fuck. That's how they got to be old ladies dude.

Speaker 3:          02:53:58       Like plank position. I'm like, lady, come on, my arms are shaking. There's some old ladies in my class at humbled me. I take these old ladies, old housewives and they're fucking tough as shit and they're in there everyday. I come there a couple days a week and they look at me like, oh, decided to drop in. So I had to cut every day. Every day you see their progress to especially. It's very impressive to me when you see flexibility, progress and old people and you realize like most of what we take for decide like, oh, this is how far your body should move when you're 60 or this is how your body should move your 70 space in the average person who doesn't do a goddamn thing with their body. They don't grow up thinking you don't eat right. Again, it's based on what you see around you. In Spain, everybody goes for a walk after dinner, you can be 90 years old.

Speaker 3:          02:54:48       They're out there walking in after the way to go to. It's nice if you go to a place, it feels good to have a meal and walk around. That's why it's like you ever eaten Malibu. There's a Malibu seafood. Do you ever see that? You know that place, right? Right on that little PCA. Yeah. Eat outside is really good and have fresh seafood there all the time. About the real in. No, no, no. I think it's called Malibu seafood. That's what it's called, but anyway, the problem is getting across the pch. You got to get across pch says death defying. Oh, you park on one side and ran across. Yeah, that's across. Especially with little kids. That's fucking scared. She'd go to the real end. It's on the pch down near to paying. I've heard. That's good. It is good. And they've got tables outside.

Speaker 3:          02:55:27       You can bring a dog and they kind of picnic tables. Anyway, we talk about this after. Yeah, but there's something about. There's another restaurant in Malibu too. That's a really good spot. It's like right on the beach and you can eat and then just go walk and it's like walking on the beach or just going for a walk like right after a meal. That's what everybody's supposed to do. Yeah, no, for sure. Yeah. It helps digestion and when you live in a, you know, I saw this so much in Spain. When you live in a culture that's healthy, you're healthy. You know what my favorite example is? Boulder, Colorado. You go to boulder, everybody's got fucking Patagonia jackets on. They're running up hills and dirt bike riding. There's a yoga place every corner and people are having fun. Having a good to not work. No, it's fun.

Speaker 3:          02:56:11       It bulb exercise is fun. That's what people don't understand. It's really an, it's not fun to be unhealthy and when you try to exercise, when you're unhealthy, it feels like shit because your body feels like shit. But once you get the dust knocked off of it and get it moving. And I'm not talking about crossfit or fucking mma training or Jujitsu, I'm just talking about any kind of exercise. Just get that blood flow and you'll be, uh, you'll be a better version of you. I got a bike. I don't know if you don't have talked about this. It's this electric assist. A mountain bike. Oh yeah. My friend John Dudley has those made so much fun. Yeah. And where I live it's like uphill to get to any of the fire roads. So a normal bike. I'm just not going to do it because it's like a half hour of hell to get any real interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:56:57       But this thing it, it only assists when you pedal. Now there's no throttle or anything. A specialized gave it to me because I had this dude on my podcast who is, I'm a professional mountain bike racer, and he was like, dude, you got to get a bike here in Topanga. This is heaven here. And I was like, yeah, but like that's where I would ride, you know, way the fuck up there. And he's like, yeah, let me talk to some people. Well my buddy John Dudley uses those for deer hunting because when you walk on the ground, well not just that when you walk on the ground, you leave, sent a. So instead of doing that, he rides a bike. So when you ride a bike, you're just like deers. Nose is so much stronger and more powerful than ours that if the wind is at your back and the deers in front of you, you're fucked.

Speaker 3:          02:57:44       You're fucked. But if you play the wind correctly, one of the best ways to avoid leaving scent of a deer passes by after you've been there is to ride a bike. But you don't want to ride a bike and exert yourself because then you'll be sweaty and you have to sit in a tree stand. You'll freeze your fucking ass off. So instead he has these electric assist bikes and they're fucking amazing. And when I was in Iowa, we took these suckers out into the woods bond. It's amazing. Like easy pill, doesn't matter, just rode up the hill. No problem. Yeah, it's still an effort, but it's not like you don't. It's just like a light walk. They're awesome. I took it out to Utah. I was out in the van scarlet to Vanson and I were out in a canyon lands. That's so nice, man.

Speaker 3:          02:58:28       That's so pretty. And there was this one ride, it was like 20 miles I think out on this jeep track, like you could never go on. I mean even in a jeep, a serious four wheel drive, you're going two miles an hour instead of these. But on this bike, just just cruise and 20 miles out to where the Colorado and the Green River converge. It's this canyon. Nobody out there. And I'm just cruising. It's like riding a horse. It's so cool. Well, I did think at one point when I was going through this field with tall grasses that I, to a cougar, I would have looked like impossible to resist. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe top speeds. Twenty miles an hour. So it would have gotten me. Most cougars are not really into attacking people, but they have attack people on mountain bikes before. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's like a yarn thing, like a ball of yarn.

Speaker 3:          02:59:23       Kitten just can't help it. Well, you've got cats, right? Yeah. I somehow, I, I feel like cats are similar enough that if I saw a cougar, I wouldn't know how to deal with it just because I know cats. Man. You can look in bluff a cat. Do you see the video I posted up today where a guy in boulder, so for fucking mountain lions on a street for together with family, it was the big ones for full grown fucking man, not a mother. And yet they don't hang together. Taro, not according to this fucking video. Go full screen and freak us out, Jamie or not. Yeah, but there's two sides. Look at that. Two big ass grown ass mountain lions, and then they go down the street. Look, what do we have at the end of the road? Oh, another big ass grown ass mountain lion. And another one line on.

Speaker 3:          03:00:09       It's back over there. Wow. Imagine turning that corner and you're fucking electric bikes road during the fucking road. So this guy, this is his house. This guy's looking out of his house. He's outside of Boulder Mountain lions. Don't give a shit. That's where I'm a mountain. Lion ate my dog and boulder. Really? Dogs all the time. They get them. They hang around near your house. They start targeting your dogs. It's easy. Prey. Got Eaten by a lion. A real the African lion. Oh Shit. That's, that's more scary. Yeah, it's Africa. Fuck. What kind of dog was it? Was a small Pomeranian American eskimo mix. Sweet out of a dog. He was a great dog. Worse ways to go. Yeah. Look, there's just some out there, man.

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       Between the bears and the dogs or the cats and also the foxes. Foxes are amazing. I mean, I love foxes. I mean, I think they're really interesting animals and they're one of the few animals in the wild that will, if you live in a certain area for long enough, they will almost become domesticated, like they get close to you and hang out with you and you could feed them and they'll, they'll walk with you and hang out with you. Like real close by. There are weird animal. They're not quite a wolf and they're not like a coyote like a Fox. Our relationship with Fox is, is very playful, you know? Have you ever seen a grizzly man? Remember his relationship with the Fox, hung around the campsite or something. Took his hat, stole his, had ran away and they were playing. The Fox used to sit on his tent and he'd be right there and be like, how are you?

Speaker 6:          03:01:47       Good morning today. I like that. They would just hang with them and walk with them. There's that lady sue Akins who lives. She lives 200 plus miles above the arctic circle. She's on that show. Life below zero. There it is. There's the grizzly man, like, look at this fucking animal just hanging with him, man. I mean, it's an odd way the fuck out the way the fuck out. But once they get accustomed to you, they're very intelligent and they realized like, this guy's not going to hurt me. And then they become like your little buddy and if you give them food, I mean, this is essentially how animals got domesticated, right? Right. This is how wolves became dogs. They just hung around with us long enough that when they were outside the edge of the campfire and we gave them food to keep them from attacking us or whatever.

Speaker 6:          03:02:31       But Fox is, and in particular, they'll kill the shit out of your cat, but kill your dog. Foxes will kill a lot of things to kill a lot of fonts. You know, it's, I, I saw um, a fox on, on the Internet with a font that was almost as big as its body and it was dragging this font across this, uh, this road. And I was like, oh, I never thought it would kill something that big. I would thought they'd get rats like, well they do generally right environment or not marmots moles and stuff. You'll see the, how they jump. They hear so well they can located under the snow. And Jana. Well here's how fucked up. I had a coyote killed one of my chickens recently and I buried the chicken and um, I was in the yard the other day. I heard this noise and my golden retriever who has zero killer instinct.

Speaker 6:          03:03:18       I mean he'll, he'll kill a bird or something. He gets a hold of it, but he's not like a guard dog. He's a sweetie and he's, he's like, what is going on over there? And these communities are on the roof of the fucking henhouse trying to pry away the chicken wire. And I hear this clink clink clink clink is the kylies biting the chicken wire trying to break it open and get into the chickens. So they killed one chicken. I chased him off. I got a video over there. I was going to post their bills. Like, this is too gross chicken. They got fucked up by this code is plus. It's sad. I love those chickens, they're like a pet, you know, so I dug a whole bird, the chicken and the coyote. He dunked the fucking hole up and found chicken and it was a couple feet down.

Speaker 6:          03:04:00       You know, it wasn't a super shallow grave. I mean that coyote smelled that chicken through two feet of dirt and went and dug it out. I went out there a couple days later and I was like, where's the fucking chicken? There's just a hole there. I was like, Whoa, this is crazy. They could smell through the dirt, man. They knew the chicken was down there. It's crazy. That's crazy. Do you ever have strange experience with wild animals while you were tripping? Never have zero experience with animals while tripping a lot. Cause I tripped in the woods alone. Yeah, man, I know too much about the words. I want a trip inside of arm compound. Well that'll be safe. Loaded guns nearby. A fear fetish. No, almost joking. Around half of it is for entertainment. I've gotten. I've done mushrooms in a field before. It didn't freak me out. A baseball field when Aubrey and I went bear hunting, he took mushrooms one of the days I didn't.

Speaker 6:          03:05:04       I wasn't with him. You know, when you go to your own little area of the woods by yourself, I find it hard to shoot anything. If I were tripping, you wouldn't. If you were hungry. The thing about those things is like, bear hunting is a weird one man, because they need to control the populations because if they don't control the populations, the bears decimate the moose and the deer and they eat 50 percent of the Fonz as it is, right. If, uh, if, uh, although deer populations out of control, a lot of places, not, not in Alberta have Pennsylvania, it's a, it's a healthy balance, but it's only apparently a healthy balance according to biologists. And it's not according to vegans are hunters, but according to biologist, it's only healthy if the bear population is kept to a certain number. If it gets too crazy, then they run out of food and then there's a lot of cannibalism already, but then it gets even worse and you know, then they start encroaching on cities and towns and it gets.

Speaker 6:          03:05:56       It gets weird, but are they treated it in terms of like a number thing instead of looking at it from a moral standpoint like should you kill an animal? They. They're like, well, if you don't kill an animal, this animal is overbalanced this, that overpopulated, this animal's going to be under populated now because they're going to go after them. They get to kill a disproportionate number of them, so they try to keep this so. But bears are apex predators. So who was killing bears? Other bears, grizzlies. So then the sort of the ultimate balance is to just leave the bears and let the other bears kill him. That's a good balance. But then you're living in a world where you have 11 foot 12 foot grizzlies everywhere you go wandering into town. If you live in a place like Alberta in some, some areas of Alberta, you have know good population of elk and Moose and deer, well that means you're gonna have a good population of monsters, so if you're comfortable with that, you just have to decide how much risk do you want to have.

Speaker 6:          03:06:52       Because once the bears chew through them, they're going to go after you. You should, uh, Boris with the bow. Yeah, I've done that. Yeah. Yeah. A friend of mine invited me to go, uh, do that in Hawaii. Hawaii has to do it. It's a good place because of that I don't have any predators. And they fuck up. And he was explaining that the boers fuck up the coral reefs because they dig up all the dirt and then it runs off in the rain and it contaminates the bays are. That makes sense? Yeah. So it's a really big thing in Hawaii that they have to really go after the bars as much as there's a project right now in Maui where they, they're going to fence in an area and the area that they're fenced in, they have to. It's like 5,000 acres, I think it is, where they have to eradicate the deer that are in this one particular area because they're trying to reclaim the forest land and a lot of these deer, the deer, most of the large mammals in Hawaii are not native and so these invasive species is access.

Speaker 6:          03:07:50       Deer from Asia actually are just, they eat everything. Nothing gets to grow, like just getting not going to be a forest because the little things grow and they just eat them, eat them right when they're coming up and they just. There's so many of them, so they also have a problem with people needing food, so what they're doing is they're like, they have this project where they're going out and they're hunting these animals, killing them and giving these food to people for free and so they've set it up like this. So they have a real sustainable food source for all these poor people, which is the best meat in the world. So delicious. I was going to say much better than industrial. Sure. Shit. It's really good. I mean, even in terms of wild game animals, they have the most delicious game animal, like two thoughts.

Speaker 6:          03:08:29       It's usually, it's either elk or access deer. Those are the two to go back and forth. I've had both. They're both amazing. But access to your are fucking everywhere. Never had bison. You must have. Yes. Yeah, that's, that's. Yeah, free. Amazing. It's amazing. Cool animal to see in a while. You have a star wars around. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We saw them in yellowstone. Big Herd of. I'm just chilling, but it was weird because they were so accustomed to people to just lounge in like 100 yards from folks. Can you imagine like before they shot them all that oceans of those things. Crazy. Know where that came from. That's another one. That's a weird one that I didn't know. Dan Flores is a fascinating guy. He wrote a book, a great book and coyotes called Coyote America, but he wrote a, um, a pete. It was a paper, a bison, diplomacy. Bison ecology. That's the name of it. But it's basically saying that what happened was when the Europeans came to America and the European spread disease, it decimated the native American population by as much as 90 percent. That is when the bison boom happened. Bison ecology and bison diplomacy. The southern plains from 1800 1850. So what his, what his take is that the overpopulation of Bison was a direct result of these native American people being decimated because their population dropped by 90 percent. No one was hunting the buffalo. So the buffalo just

Speaker 5:          03:09:54       went crazy. And there's with no hunters chasing after him. One, two, three decades later, you've got a shit ton of Bison says running around everywhere. And he points to early settlers that described in great detail all of the various game animals that they came across. But nerium mentioned of the Bison and certainly not a mention of like these gigantic million strong herds of bison roaming the plains. Anything that's a direct result of all of their predators, the native Americans who had got really good hunting them and even even surplus, letting them where they drive them off cliffs and just take what they could. That was at the bottom. Although it's also interesting to think how the introduction of horses would have changed everything. Horses and guns. What Dan Flores says that is that just with this, with why, just forget about European settlers. Just the native Americans with horses and rifles were on their way to extra painting the by the Bison.

Speaker 5:          03:10:51       Yeah. Crazy. So we, I mean, this does not exonerate all the Europeans that had the stacks of bones and that killed them in mass. They certainly did that. There's no doubt about it. And that's what almost caused the, uh, the complete extinction. That's it. It was at the end. It was the Europeans. It was us, the settlers to starve out the Indians. Yeah. Well, no, it wasn't even. That is, that's another thing that they think that there was not a concerted effort to starve about the Indians. They wanted it for search for food. They wanted the tongues. What I read is the Buffalo Bill and those dudes were shooting them and just leaving the bodies out there. It was to wipe out the Lakota because they couldn't fucking beat the Lakota. That might've been done as well, but that's not. That's not what. What killed them off.

Speaker 5:          03:11:36       I mean when you see these giant stacks of skulls, they were doing that for using them as a commodity. A lot of it was just for their tongues, believe it or not. Their tongues were very valuable, valuable delicacy, and then it was for their skins and you know when they. They had meat hunting. They had what they called market hunting where they take guys who came back from the war and they were looking for a job, but one of the best jobs and get, are you good shot? Great. You can be a hunter, and they would go and shoot fucking everything. Everything that moved and they wiped out all the antelope, elk, all the. It wasn't just the bison, it's just the bison is such an iconic thing and then obviously those piles of skulls, it was unusual. The amount of effort they put into killing them, but I don't think it was necessarily just to just to wipe out them so that the native Americans would star. I'm sure they did that locally and bury my heart at wounded knee. No, I don't think I did. It's a beautiful book. It's really interesting book about the sort of final chapter of different tribes in North America, Jeronimo and the Apaches and sitting bull and all these people and it's just really interesting the story of the sort of contact and the characters and the different things that happen. Yeah. I

Speaker 3:          03:12:52       read that when I was very young when I was running around in a loin cloth, throwing apples at rabbits. That is, if you look at human history, what is this here? They used to shoot them from. From. From trains. Yeah. They did it for fun too. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. There were so many of them. They just thought they could just shoot them. What else? What our relationship with the natural world that represents, you know, well this is what I was going to say is like, has there ever been anything like that other than I mean anything in terms of the impact of a group of people landing on a continent like nothing that we've ever observed, so the greatest mortality in history for sure and did great. It's changed to like not only that but this weird movement to the west and like landing landing on this weird continent that was filled with these people that lived in a completely different way.

Speaker 3:          03:13:47       I mean, what are the odds that you're going to get to a place you think of where Europe was in the 17 hundreds, the 14 hundreds, you know, when the first started arriving and think of the sophistication with the boats and the written language and all the different things, and then they show up, go across the ocean and land to a place that has zero cities. No, there were cities to. The land was. Was bigger than almost all European cities. When Cortez walked into it, that's in Mexico. That's where the Aztecs were. They also had sewage and lit streets. They did more in South America and North America, right? Yeah. No, nor from. I mean, you're talking about America, Canada. There was nothing comparable at that point, but that's what I meant. I mean, like when they're landing here and they made their way all the way to California, they're not encountering a single city.

Speaker 3:          03:14:35       Right? I mean, that's just fucking bananas. You've got thousands of miles of just natural people living in tents. Yeah, no, crazy. Do you ever sleep in a teepee? Now this place in Terlingua stating the teepee. Jeff Microbiology Guy, he's got a bunch of, or microbiome guy. He's got a bunch of teepees. They like luxury, beautiful teepees, luxury teepees. Fucking gray. That's a luxury tp, uh, Jamie base. Camp Terlingua. You'll see fucking beautiful base camp and Terlingua t e R L I n g u a Terlingua. It's uh, yeah, they're, they're fucking sweet there. They've got like a concrete base and maybe a three foot wall around it. And then the teepees on top so the wind doesn't blow around. And then he showed me the design of tbs is really interesting. It's like they're designed so the wind comes under the teepee, have that dope. They rent those out. Yeah. Oh, this is crazy. We offer once of a kind one of a kind experience without massive 26 foot tp over the top of a sunken Kiva. What's a Kiva? Kiva is like a Hopi dwelling that's semi submerged. Each of our three luxury hold each of three luxury. TPS has a comfy, comfy king size bed. Fold out couch. Plenty of seating rubs throughout. Sink under counter fridge. Keurig coffee maker, the microwave. Microwave popcorn outdoor fire pit, I think outdoors. One word there, isn't it?

Speaker 3:          03:16:08       And house a private bath. House private. Hey Jeff, get with the CISO mountains. It's a beautiful area. Is it? Looks like it, man. That looks bad ass. Nice. Wow. I slept in both of those. That's cool. One hundred year old. Hold on Jim. A rebuilt this rule. One hundred year old. Ruined. Located in the heart of Terlingua ghost town. Wow, that's amazing too. We gotta wrap this up, right? I got to Piss on your source. I'm sure you do. Tangentially reading. It's out now. Anybody can get it everywhere, all the places that they sell books and of course tangentially speaking places you get podcasts is this, man. I'm glad you did this. I'm glad you became a podcast guy. The podcast world is richer for it. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. I'm richer for it. Thanks to you and Duncan, Chris, Ryan motherfuckers. See you guys tomorrow. Bye.
