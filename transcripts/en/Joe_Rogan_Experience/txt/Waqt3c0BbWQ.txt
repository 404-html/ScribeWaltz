Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience, how did it humble you? Like in what way? Because I realized that when we were, let's say when I'm, when I film a documentary and I'm [inaudible], uh, I from a documentary called [inaudible] Negra and um, and Cape Verde two years ago. Aqua Negro. Yeah. Iguana. Does that mean black water? Yes, in Portuguese. And then, uh, we were there for about five weeks, five or six weeks. And then the living conditions were pretty bad and there was no grocery stores around and we had to catch my own food. And then it was really a self sufficient type of chip. In the first week. I remember the only thing I could focus on was, oh God, this is, this is terrible. The, we don't have a showered is no hot water, bathroom are disgusting, I'm starving is nothing around. And then all you can thing is like, how will you comfort is gone. And after week, that's the,

Speaker 1:          01:04          the focus change on the good things that we're seeing around us and why having nothing all of a sudden then I was like, oh, I actually now for the first time in my life can take the time to realize what's good around me and then how we were having fires with the neighbors and then how we were offering and fish and we were thinking, oh, you know, if I give this guy two fish is going to eat one today and one tomorrow. But no, the inviting the neighbors to share when they made sure that it was like a whole like community sentence to all of it. And I was like, wow, I've been living in London for six years. I don't even know the name of my neighbor. And it's, it's, it's, it's bad. It's not, it's not a way of living that I want. It's not focusing in the right thing is, and it's, it was that, that that's in that way, you know, it's realize how much of, how much of an asshole we actually became and I just didn't want to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:56          The moment the cameras went off, Masa waukee twisted a spoon and started getting it to twist. The producer had a complete mental breakdown. Now, up to this point, I'm just thinking, this is tricks, right? It's not, it's not that big of a deal. He starts screaming, yelling that randy's evil should never have listened to randy. He would've got this on tape if it wasn't for Randy. And he looks down and he's got a wet spot on the front of his pants and he looks down and he says, I just had a demonic ejaculations like literally, and he's having his mental breakdown. I go and I have to spend the night, which was not a bad thing. She was quite pleasant to look at his, his assistant. I had to spend the night with her in her room because randy was calling her. I'm not randy. I mean, uh, uh, Tony editable calling or the producer was calling her consistently screaming and yelling about randy and the skin the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          02:49          You can't just gloss over the fact that guy just nutted in his pants. He was yelling, you're just gonna. He had a med. It's a mental breakdown. I mean, it's like a hot orgasm and your pants during a mental note. I didn't it. He did it. They should document that. That's more impressive than banging a spoon. I should have said. Yep. That's my psychic ability working right there. I mean, that doesn't make any sense. So he, he tells you he has an a jackie in his pants. He in front of everybody, he says it's a demonic ejaculation. He straight up says, I am the Arctic ejaculations. Seems like a together guy with definitely got a head on his shoulders. He was a producer for us. I think it was BBC, if I'm not mistaken. He was doing a documentary for them, so yeah. Well he's fucking crazy, huh? He finished a documentary, so, oh well, yeah, definitely. It wasn't crazy then. As long as you finish this documentary. Well, he believed in psychic phenomena. He also believed the demon made him come in his pants. That is true.

Speaker 3:          03:40          How are we going to do this calorie? What are we going to do? We filled our BC up. When I run out of air, I'm now thinking in my mind, how am I going to die, Joe? Right? Tell my wife, tell my kid I'm not fucking, I'm coming home now. I got to fucking realize how am I going to die? I have a notepad that you carry in your pocket to draw and write on. I'm thinking, what? What? What are you going to say? What's your, what's your letter going to be? You're writing a fucking death later. You're awake. You're a fighter. We figured this out. They don't fucking find a way to Kuwait. You fucking bitch. He's a conversation. I'm having one. And I said, well, I'm in fucking complete panic morning, complete darkness thinking that there's no, this is how people die. What the fuck are you doing?

Speaker 3:          04:20          You're going to write a letter to your fucking kid and tell her how you, how you fucked up. I'm sorry. Daddy's not coming home. So I'm fucking thinking I'm not going to drown. They're not going to breathe my last breath. So I'm going to breed this BC that just fill up with air and I'm a fucking breathe it until the oxygen level no longer happens and I'd just pass out. That's, that's my, that's what I've come to realize how I'm going to die. I'm going to fucking just slip away and pass out, keep breathing the same air until I go away and I start thinking, you fucking piece of shit. You're, you're giving up. You're having the legitimate conversations with myself while fucking a complete panic. Like you're, you're going to quit that. You're writing a letter and you're gonna fucking breathe your last air until you pass out you fucking pussy.

Speaker 3:          05:04          You're a fighter. Figured the fuck out. So I'm upside down. I'm crawling on the ceiling. I remember when I came in, we came in the big cave and there's like a huge fucking crack that runs along the top turn. Both my watch off now at this point, because they're giving off light and I kill my light. And I said that crack in a fucking lead to the surface. That cracks going to fucking give us something. So I just call, start panicking. Me Panicking Leni again because I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. I'm sucking air and a fucking breathing hard and I'm hyperventilating and crying on the ceiling, crying on the ceiling, looking for this fucking cracking. God Damn it. I found it. I found the crack and I followed the crack and the crack got bigger and all of a sudden I see fucking glow, like green glow, crawl and crawl on. Find it. Try to get up. My tags are too big. I can't fucking get out of the little hole. Can't get out of the hole. I'm fucking big. Be Big, big fucking hitting, screaming, freaking out. Calm down. Cowboy. Calm down, Kelly. This is the way. Calm the fuck down. Reel it in. Reel it in. We're here. We made it grab control. Fall the cracks and more opens up out. Boom. There's theK fucking I'm out made it. You're coming home. You are doug about. Wow.

Speaker 3:          06:26          That was the feeling. Meanwhile, my guys out there, I can't be mad at him because he panicked. He grabbed line. He fucking ran out the hole. He looks at me and he says,

Speaker 4:          06:40          MMM,

Speaker 3:          06:43          so we're not diving together ever again, Ali. I said, no, that was it. That was it. And I texted my girl, I love you baby. And uh, they was fucking scary moment, but daddy's coming home.

Speaker 1:          06:58          What is it like to have Jordan Peterson has a dad. Is it weird? Do you have to check yourself constantly? Make sure you're on, on steady ground? And I'd say anything ridiculous. No, not at all. None at all. I didn't realize it was weird until I went away to university and then kind of saw like just when I was away for a while and then when I came back to the house, especially because the house was full of like paintings and masks and statues and like 32 different paint colors and they came back and was like, oh, maybe he's a bit eccentric.

Speaker 1:          07:29          No, he's definitely eccentric. Um, we were talking off air about what it was like to watch your dad to become famous and, and become famous. And in his 50s, right? Like, yeah, I hope 54 55 that's when he became famous before that. Relatively unknown, respected professor. One issue with this one transgender bill, the, the preferred pronouns bill, and then boom, off to the races. Yeah, it's strange. It was, yeah, it was super weird, especially how the media was portraying him and how what was actually happening at the events wasn't what was being portrayed in the media. So that was weird to watch. And then people recognizing him on the street is strange. It's, yes. When you say what, what happened in real life was not, was what was being portrayed like what was different? Um, mostly what he was saying. So most of what he said is on film anyway.

Speaker 1:          08:25          So you can go to youtube and see what he's been saying. Like not, there's not like some secret that's going around, but what's been portrayed has been so much more negative than what he's actually said. Or they'll take like sound bites and just weave a story that isn't quite true. Which I didn't read it for some reason. I now it looks silly, but for some reason I just thought that what the media was portraying was honest always. Yeah. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not, they're trapped in there and they can't. Right get out. They, they didn't have an

Speaker 2:          08:56          option to say, I don't want to see him. It's really interesting. All the different spins though. All the different women spins, you know? And W one, one really bizarre spin that I saw was this one was saying that this is indicative of the problem of all comedy clubs and aggressive male audience and women sitting there feeling threatened, not being able to use their voice. I'm like user voice. Like what are you gonna heckle? Oh yeah. They were saying like, like you would be more empowered if there were more women. So you could heckle is, that's not cool. Like you're not supposed to do that at a comedy club have you don't like someone just don't laugh, you know? Right. But like, I mean this one was, here's the thing, it's not your job or it's not your place to say that you don't like someone when the other people do like it.

Speaker 2:          09:41          You know, if you were right, if you're going to get, I'm going to walk out. Yeah. Just like you're going to see a movie, like you're an audience member. The deal is you're not there to perform. The audience is there to just sit there and laugh or not laugh, right? But don't be rude to the other people that are enjoying it. So as soon as you break your sensibilities above the rest of the audience, well, you are a problem, right? You've made, if you decide like, hey, I didn't like this, I'm going to go home and write about it. That's totally your prerogative. That's fine. Get up and walk out. Yeah, that's fine. Go somewhere else and talk about it on stage yourself. Yeah. No, nothing wrong with any of those things. Yeah. But this, this one woman's take was like, women don't feel like they have, uh, they can, they have the ability to speak out about it.

Speaker 2:          10:21          I'm like, speak out. Like, so you're saying like to heckle, Hey, I don't want you on stage. I know everything about you and your story. I talk to me. I want you to perform in front of me. Even those other people are laughing. Right? And th th that these aggressive men were yelling, good to see you back. Louie. Aggressive men. Like, okay. That's like, there's a framing of this and this is one of its, becomes this male versus female framing that sort of represents aggressive men, sexual men doing things to women. They don't want, the women are sitting there in silence. They don't want to be there and they don't have a voice because they feel overwhelmed and out overpopulated or, uh, eh. Outnumbered.

Speaker 5:          11:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:12          Okay.
