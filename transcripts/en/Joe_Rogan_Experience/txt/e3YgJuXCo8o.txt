Speaker 1:          00:00:21       Gero going experience

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:39       what? What bitches we hear? Yeah. Brian [inaudible]. Lisa gentlemen, the one and only here. Good to be here. Very excited when my favorite favorite fucking human beings to ever walk the face of the planet. Thank you sir. Can these here to join us at the fucking birth of the apocalypse as it's happening right before our eyes Steve, build your canoes. What the fuck is going on man? I'm building canoes. I live in Venice Bro. So I'm, I'm, I'm going to, I got to have a canoe on, on the top of my roof there. Oh, you really thinking about getting something like that. I don't know if I can, who's going to save you buddy? Come out, all that stuff. You should. I'm always thinking real worst case scenarios, but you live by the water. When you live by Venice, you, you really must take into account that we just like Japan or on a fault line and that should could happen here.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       That's a fucking nine dude. A nine a nine. We can't even wrap our heads around what that means. A nine is so video and I couldn't believe how long it lasted. Five minutes. Five minutes. That's ridiculous. Five minutes at nine. What would people, if people don't know the Richter scale, how it works? Every one point is 100% stronger than the point before it. Right? So 7.2 100% stronger than a 7.1. This was a not so crazy. This is the only that no human beings have ever that are alive. Have ever experienced that before in recorded history? No, not the biggest in recorded history with the biggest that I think anybody that's alive as ever experienced. I believe it's the biggest Japan, it guess it's the fifth or sixth biggest earthquake in history and it's big. The biggest one. Japan's ever, I don't trust all that.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       What happened were you doing with divine sweaty. Okay. And when did you, do you just change the volume side? Is that better? Yeah. What'd you do? I just turned down the is too high. You know, I turned on the, Hey Joe, I turned on the headphone volume cause it's super loud in my headphones and the only way I can uh, turn down my headphones, it's by turned on in your life. Look at him. He's denying trying to keep it like, oh, all right. You got a little tense really quick quickly to knows how to he got I think I'm sure. I'm sure. I think I'm serving right now. Just keep it together but everything's fine. Just don't freak out. Don't freak out. Brian said that the most important thing to these things, just let it happen to just go with it buddy. By the way, have you shrimp lately? It's been a few months. I haven't served in like eight years because the last time I shermed I have violently was shitting and puking at the same time and tripping in the bathroom for like

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       six hours. It was a horrible experience so I have been kind of nervous to do it again. Eight on the last night, most beautiful thing in the whole entire road. Like amazing. There was parts I was with my friend where I was looking at them and like their faces, you could just feel the energy coming from their face like visually. It was amazing. How much did you only ate half of eighth and made it into a tea and did the ti process where you, you boil it and then, and then you drink it and then he let let sit for like another whatever, 30 minutes or whatever. And then you ate those shrooms and it was awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:03:33       Why should I drink the tea? And you chose so clean. Ever tell you my shrimp mushrooms experienced with the last time I did shrooms cause I was never a seasoned drug addict. I was with Patty Murray. Patty. Sure. So I take mushrooms and I eat a lot of them cause man, I was like, let me see what these are like a cut to me. I took a four hour shower and had, I wept, I laughed, I reassessed my life and then I saw, started seeing myself from the side. I just started seeing my profile and I was sitting on a wall looking down at me. You know my profile and I was like, here's a couple of problems. My legs way too short for my torso. Oh by the way, I'm a coat hanger. I've always wanted to be a barrel chested Samoan. I'm on a coat hanger from a long line peasant, an Irish stock who are used to being persecuted, running, you know, knobby knees.

Speaker 4:          00:04:24       The whole thing was a disaster. Genetics are enough. Fair now man. You look at some fucking football players, some of those giant Goliath. You could get a guy like check Congo, like when you're standing next to check Congo genetics and welfare. There's dudes that are born like your friend that we were talking about in the kitchen. Your friend of your doughy small, the feminist friend. That guy just got to roll the dice. It looks like an overgrown baby. It's just a roll of the dice. Man. He could've been checked Congo. I know what the fuck. I know I can be built to like any, if I could have any jeans in the, I'd want Samoan. Some Simone, just big and they can take a punch to, she's as Christ Mark Hunt. He's a k one champion and he's now when he's fighting in the UFC now he just won his last fight and uh, he's famous for it.

Speaker 4:          00:05:07       Dude's head kicking him and he just fucking wobbles a little and then straightens right back up. Loans come in, they did a thing on, if you are Samoan, you are 55 times. I believe this was the number and it was on 60 minutes and I believe they said you're, if you're Simone, you are 55 times more likely to play in the NFL. Any white guy on the planet. There's so there's still fucking strong Hong Gins that Lowery's and the, and the Samoans. This just on another giant bones like your wrists, like elbows and fast, like a lot of fast twitch muscle, not this endurance muscle like, oh yeah, it could have been like, I knew his trainer dude, he was so bad ass, but for whatever reason, never really, totally got it together. Lennox Lewis beat them and that took a lot of wind out of his sails. Cause when it's tagged him a couple times pretty hard. Well, I know the guy that trained, uh, to

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       have for that fight for the Lennox Lewis fight. I've actually worked out with him and he said that the first time I'd had ever done, he never done a squat and I believe, I don't want to misquote him, but he didn't. He said he put four 20 on his shoulders and he did a deep squat. He went all the way down to where his ass touching his heels and came back up and the trainer was like, who is a power lifter? It was like, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. You've never squatted. He goes, no man. By the end of it, he was like, they had that has two horses, two dead horses to a bar. You know, he's, he's one of the scariest heavyweight boxers would come along in a long time. He wasn't able to beat the best guys that you never beat Lennox Lewis, but he could, he could put anybody to sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:06:35       Do you ever see the fight when he fought John Ruiz? No. He caught John. It's on youtube. He caught genre is a very big man. Tough dude too. You know he's a burly guy. Didn't John Ridley's fight Holyfield like three fucking times. Yeah, I think he did. He was, he was rough David too. We'll put them to sleep. Dude just jumped on him early. Hit him with those gigantic ham hocks. Fix it. Hit him with like he tagged them early and then just put them away. Put them completely to sleep. You know, you wonder as more and more money ventures in the MMA a lot. Some of those guys who are playing some of those Hershel Walker's and and, and Michael Vick's, they're going to start coming to MMA. Yeah. Some of the guys who don't want to, they don't want to, you know, be playing for a team.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       They'd rather fight footballs. Also ironically, way more dangerous for you then is any MMA career. That's so funny that people dispute that, but everyone looks at it in an emotional way. You don't look at it in a contact way. Like look at these people are running at each other and at 50 years old, take a look at their heads. I mean, it's not even, it's not a little bit more dangerous. It's way more way more dangers. US fucking poor guys. Like that kid was his name, Chris Henry, the kid that fell off the back of a pickup truck and died. You remember he was a chasing after his girlfriend. Receiver. Yeah. Yeah. Really talented athlete. Right. Well young kid I built, I think he was only like 25, 25 or 20, I think it was 25. Anyway, it's fucking massive brain damage. When they went, did an autopsy on him, you know, the concussions and he's hands, he's playing football actually shrinks and all Kinda, you get dementia.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       I mean that's what Lou Gehrig's disease is all about. I mean a lot of these guys are getting it. It's all from head impacts and just reparable damage. Yeah. Cause it als or Lou Gehrig's disease, um, they used to think was a function of toxin, a toxin. They had all different kinds of theories, but they're, they're starting to link, they think they're starting to link some of this stuff to the als syndrome, whatever, to um, to, uh, um, yeah, there was a whole Bryant Gumbel special about it. It's scary stuff, man. People take that real lightly, you know, they take head trauma real lightly. We don't, we're learning more and more, I guess now and now, you know, that really raises a huge question, which is if, if indeed you can start to prove that for concussions or three concussions caused brain damage, if that's the case or, and, and

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       the, and if they're able to actually measure this, it will put a real onus on the NFL to figure out a way to either change the rules or make helmet safer, but then you don't have football. Right. You know, so it really, it kind of, it doesn't raise rugby's probably safer because they don't wear helmets. They tell me don't smash each other. I went to a rugby match recently actually in the south of France with a, I think it was like the bask team with the aim of trying to do now and even international traveler. I done an international sports events to soccer and phones. I seller in the south of tribes. Of course. Yes. And, and uh, I wish I could speak that way. How would it be that, that, that really pretentious man, you know, compared to a lot of people, what you just said was that, yeah, I didn't even me I'm talking about I go to a soccer game and France like what?

Speaker 4:          00:09:50       Two things I don't need plugged in tight shorts. Thing I noticed was that there that they're just as, they're a huge men, a lot of Samoans, just huge dudes. Shrug the players. Starts by the way, really overseeing that thing that they do that and know that dance, they dance at the Haka. Holy Shit Dude. That's the New Zealand all blacks. It's my favorite thing. Did you see ever see the black and white one? There's a black and white one of them. I've seen every one of them more than it does to me. It's like an Adidas had, is that what it is? Fuck. It's good. Have you ever seen that? If go go, if you're listening to this, go to do a Haka dance, New Zealand, all blacks and, and there are so many of them, and take a look at that day. It's a war dance and they'd been doing it since the 18 hundreds, uh, and it's carried on as a tradition and they take it seriously.

Speaker 4:          00:10:37       Dope. It would think it's stupid. Like, what is this dumb ass shit? I got a really good one for. You can see this one too. Freaks. He's just, he just literally just freaks they, they've worked themselves into a frenzy, man. Yeah, it's a, it's a fascinating thing to watch. It's fun. It looks like it's real. You know what I mean? Like they're going crazy, but it's not like I don't feel like you're faking it. I feel like that's what they're thinking. That's in their heart. I believe him and Jimmy, Jimmy Burke, by the way, our dear friend Jimmy Burke from New York, I got in a fight and my friend got in a fight with a guy cause he told the guy, he looked like a combination of Rudolph Nureyev and uh, uh, he was this big guy, walks out and goes, he was drunk. Goes Dude, you look like Rudolph Nureyev and, and some other old actor and something that like, you know, I don't know like Clark Gable or, and the guy's like, why did it goes and then he comes back and he goes, what'd you say?

Speaker 4:          00:11:23       I look like it goes Uday up cause he, cause he has, he walked out, he goes, he had rid of Nerd, he was a gay dance or gay dance. I think that means, but anyway, and the guy goes, what looks back? And he comes back and he goes, what would you say? I look like that's gay woo woo. Anyway, the guy takes his, Jack goes, let's go outside right now. So chimney goes out there and my buddy juries with them and he and he says to Jerry, whispers to everything I do. It's like January. He takes his shirt off, he's got no shirt on, it's freezing. He starts doing the Haka dance at the dude, but he's not looking at the guy and the guy starts to flip in. The bounces are holding them back and Jimmy never looked at it. We just did the Haka dance but made a really sexual sexual Haka dance and he was like, Hey, Hey da, and he's not looking at him and flexing basically posing.

Speaker 4:          00:12:13       You have to explain this Guy Jimmy Burke for this story to really work. You tell us about a normal person and you're going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about? That doesn't even, I can't even make sense out of that. Like did someone would judge me. Burke is 50 years old. He's ease. We call them the national treasure. He's got a very long neck. He's got very red skin. He's got no eyebrows and very, very one of my favorite fucking Jimmy Burke lines ever. He goes, I ran into her accidentally. She thought I was stalking her. She goes, he's talking to me. I'm like, believe me, honey, if I, if I was stalking you wouldn't be caught me and I have stalked her and I have stock. That was a good fucking funny, that guy. Funniest, craziest. I got it for the impression at the beginning, but then I lost it. I need to be around him more. I need to see that guy. I'm going to be in New York.

Speaker 4:          00:13:01       He's battery, very enthusiastic. He really moves his mouth and by the way, by the way, he's a very good shape. Very good. You know, they hold it, hold. That map was in very good shape and weight. If you're reacting, you're like, oh, he does. He does. He makes children cry because he loves kids. He's like, Woo. And sure enough, shining babies, like four year olds are like, he's like, he, and then he looked at me one time, he went down to the baby and I was laying and he's going, oh sure it off. I'm like, one, two, three. It takes three seconds. He pulled the slide. I look like skeletor. It looked like a red scout and he looks at the mother. He goes, he goes, I'm so sorry. And his face looks like it's plasticine. What? He says that if you know him, it doesn't make you uncomfortable.

Speaker 4:          00:14:01       But if God, if I did know him and there was a guy like that, I'd be like, what does this loose cannon? I can't predict what he might do. I might do something nutty. He did this. How about this? He, I'm saying this a podcast. I hope he's listening. I literally, um, he, he, first of all, he, he rides his bike everywhere. He, he's 50 on a bicycle on a TV and that's all he said. And that's all he wants. He's like, how he's always been, he's a monk. He's a true monk. And uh, and he, and he's in better shape than anybody in the world. He says, come downstairs. I'm on 57th and eighth and ninth, and my mother's apartment. He goes, it's literally 12 at night in New York City on like Christmas Eve or around Christmas, you know, where everybody's on the street, you know, it's everyone. And he goes, come downstairs. I have to show you something. Come down in five minutes, click. I go, all right, this should be good. Throwing my coat. I got off stage. I'm standing with the doorman outside. I hear from a long, long way away. Ah, um, um, uh, uh, a tape deck, the halls with balls up, holiday. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:14:57       and he's rides by me and I in a down jacket, cowboy hat and no pants, no pants. And he's writing, he's popping with his ass in the air. And I see this, this dead baby bird, this, this, this, and this. This pad, what it looked like, a large boy. Just say, you know, he's gonna, he's home, but he's, it's just the no heroin. He's got a little red hairs on it and it's a disaster. The whole thing. And this white body, he sees me on white neon, like Irish, like though, like lost the picnic. I'm like Gollum, loss of pigment lottery. He gets into his son, he starts smoking literally. He was like a vampire, I swear to God. So he's got this incredible, and he just, and this woman goes, he's coming this way. He's coming in sweat. He goes, Chris Smith's man. And literally I just see he bikes by in his ass and I see his two balls, his 50 year old balls just just swinging like a pendulum outside. And she, the woman goes, he's coming this way. He's coming this way. He, she goes, she goes and screams at him and he goes, have a great time. It turns back around and try us back a block near to Jesus Christ. He is a streaker man. What is he doing for living in these days? He still acts and you know, he said he does. He does. Funny. He's got really rich friends too who all want him around. So please come, come on the trip. It's a private jet. We'll take anywhere. He's like, all right.

Speaker 4:          00:16:20       That's the thing about Joe. He heals very few people in the world, especially when they get there. And I can do this, can be like, dude, you want to go to a Tibet, Tibet, alright, no plans, nothing, nothing, nothing. And what does it do? Just cause clients, hey, I'm not going to train you this week or not or not. He just goes to Tibet. It doesn't say anything to that. And then they show up at their appointments. What's his dad? So he goes all over the world for free. He's such an odd duck man. This, I've always admired how, how, what, what a free spirit he is. But also like how like you always think like guys like that are going to, you know, some point in time at least make an attempt to appear to have their shit together. No, he knows. He's an amazing guy.

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       And I'm going to tell you the other thing he is, is he's truly made peace with like with his true atheists, like a real atheist, truly made peace with the fact that he is only here for a short period of time and he's, he's dying to him is not something he's afraid of. He came down with tuberculosis, but they didn't know what it was cause he had been exposed to it by his grandfather when he was three years old. Oh, he's, he starts going to the hospital and they, I get a call, my buddy says they're looking at it, they think as lung cancer or that disease that those nine one, one firemen get that where your lungs disintegrate from breathing, all that stuff. I have the one, they're both fail. So, and they're looking for it and they tell them, look, this is probably what it is. And I was with him when it was shortly after he knew all that you would never have known and it's not denial. He said to me, he goes, he told me what the prognosis was. And I was like, Jesus, my best friends. I was like, this is the worst thing. And he said, I said, how do you feel? You seem so normally. He goes, Brian, first of all, if I'm

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       going to die, I'm going to treat it like it's a comedy. And Oh, by the way, my funeral better be a good time and you better make people laugh. Oh. And by the way, I've made peace with my life. I'm not afraid to die. And I saw that firsthand, which I thought it was just, you know, he's just an amazing guy. He's got a good grip on things in a weird way, you know, he reads everything. He knows that. I mean, he knows so much. Very, very bright guy. That's why it's, it's so strange that guys like that almost always in somehow or another they fall into some, at least a semblance of normalcy. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like they don't, they're not 50 with an apartment and a TV and a bike, you know, like you try to get your shit together, you try it, you run a house somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. We've got a house now looking to buy, but you know, anywhere which he, he, he never, he never was. He's never been. And it's not like anything is self conscious about either? No. Is this guy ticketless? Uh, I don't know. Let's find out. Brian. I don't know. Brian got some time this weekend and just see what Gilbert Godfrey said, uh, about Japan. Yeah. What do you, what do you guys think about that? Have you seen it? Well, let's read the quotes, the quotes Gilbert got, right.

Speaker 3:          00:18:50       Yeah. To me it was like, all right, that's, that's not even trying to be like, ah, edgy or like, I don't know what he's thinking. He's pretty funny. Yeah. I mean, but still, I don't even think that's even to me. Yeah. Too soon. What did you think? What did you think of? I was so, I just thought definitely does he realize how many people died and how many kids died? How many fucking, you know, seriously, if there's time where you should just not do anything and there's definitely, I think a time period, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:19:17       Wow. Yeah. I don't, I don't try to stay anything like that. I mean, that's what it felt. I'm not fucking raising flags and protesting and anytime that's fair to to be con, I think we should all be more conscious of people's feelings. It's 50 cents a 50 censored a look. This is very serious people. I had to evacuate all my hoes from La, Hawaii and Japan. I had to do it. Lol. He gets points up until the lol. That's right. First of all, because lol, lol. Especially when you have the, just the first letter capitalized and then the next one, not that looks really fucking stupid dog. Alright, that looks dumb. Either you go with all caps or no caps with your lol. Okay. Second of all, are you a girl? No. Then what's with the lol? Listen, that's for girls and retards. That's what lol is for or, but the, the idea behind it, you know, that you just started immediately making jokes about all these poor fucking people they're going to hit next and that kind of stuff. I don't have a problem with people making jokes about it. Why wait? You know, I don't know. I think what he said was hilarious. I had evacuated all my hoes. I mean, come on. That's fucking funny. Since one was fine with me. What, what did, uh, coffee, sir. Okay. You had a much more Gilbert Godfrey. Let's see. Let's see what his tweet said. Gilbert Godfrey's tweets where uh, oh, the not even shown them, man.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       They covered him up. Well, it's not in this one. One way go. Our stories, whether or not one was kind of like, hey, my girlfriend broke up with me, don't worry. Another one will float by soon, or something like that. I can't find them. Unfortunately. I think some asking, you're trying to be funny. Sometimes things can go awry. Yeah, well, I mean he's just a silly guy. You know, he's a silly guy who, who's funny and then, yeah, but that's something you say to your friends maybe a couple of times. I've laughed harder with that guy. We did an episode of CSI together and we just had the most off color fund in the world, but it was also, you also got to understand the mentality of the New York comedian were newer comics are always trying to over insult you to the point of being.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       He just completely outrageous. Like Jim Norton told a really funny story on Opie and Anthony About Louis C K and him hanging out and the in the village and Lucy Kay just walks up to him and slaps his pizza onto the ground and says, your mother's a cunt like out of nowhere. And Andy and Jim Norton is laughing. While he's telling us and he's just like, I was it juicy slice of pizza too. I was so bad. But it's like I read you the text that will us and to me, cause we have a relationship like that where he just, we tried to reach southeast trash and making salt each other. They'll worst we can. He started calling me a mule and just, and he sends me the most outrageous texts. I can't even describe those relationships with friends like that are fun. Like people don't understand. You try to get like Eddie Bravo and I do that shit to each other all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:22:21       Go ahead and get [inaudible]. But anyway, Gilbert Gottfried is in, you know, he's a comic and when you're a comic, you mean sometimes you're right shit and you're writing shit really for people like you and for fucking Gilbert, if he was at home and he was reading someone's Twitter and he started saying all this shit about Japan, he would be laughing his fucking ass off. It doesn't mean that he's not a sensitive guy. It doesn't mean that he doesn't feel bad for all these people. It's just, it's also funny. Well, I called them one time I was doing, but have you ever seen a little Asian girl cry? It's so adorable. And now times that by millions and it'll Gilbert Godfrey, he's going over there. No, listen man, I actually think it's right to say those things, but I think it's funny to Gilbert. It's funny stuff. I mean, it's funny to me to look, I feel terrible about what happened in Japan, but those were still good jokes and you know, he's, he's, yeah, they're good jokes, but not good judge.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       Maybe depending your Twitter. No, listen, I wouldn't say them. I wouldn't say him for a bunch of reason that says, I wouldn't want to say anything that would hurt anybody's feelings like that. Especially someone who just randomly got go. I don't care how funny the joke is to make, I don't think, but that's, I don't think Gilbert is a Kinda guy. Whoever, he's not gonna no sacred cows to him. He's one, he's gonna, he's gonna say the joke and he's a good guy. He's not a bad guy. It's just that he's looking for the laugh. There's a laugh there and he sees it and as a comic you just goes for it and then you know, people freak out and get upset about it. I'm sure he probably never expected, he's from the age of no Internet, you know, he's from the age where you could say anything you wanted.

Speaker 4:          00:23:45       So you know those guys they developed that way. You forget how many people are not into what you're talking about. Right. You know, and that's what it becomes. Yeah, it's, it's okay. The only problem was that he's a commercial artist as well. He does commercials and that that's what fucked him. They pulled him off of a campaign because you know, look, obviously this is a terrible tragedy, you know, and no one's, no one's trying to make light of that, but can't you can't you both mourn for the people and laugh too. Is that possible? And I was going to say this is what I was going to say is, is that, you know, for the most part, I think in tragedy, that's exactly what you need it. The last thing, somebody who's going through a tragedy needs is a bunch of other people acting really somber around that suppressing happiness and laughter.

Speaker 4:          00:24:29       And it's not, I'm not saying that, you know, you should be happy that that happened. Of course not, but shouldn't, you know, shouldn't we try to be the happiest we can at all times? Always. Absolutely. And I, and I think there's always room for humor and, and it does take some of the sting out of it if I that's it's very soon. But it rethink about how a lot of times you do deal with, with things, you start marking when you're actually over something by how, how easily you can make fun of it and how easily you can take those. So sometimes you're pushing that too quickly obviously. And I think there is a time to reflect and be [inaudible] I think. But I agree. But there's something to people about making a joke about a situation as to not being able to feel for the people that, that, that are in that situation.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       And it's not, it's just that it got, it's so far removed, it's way over there that he doesn't even think about it. He just says the joke. Right. I mean, I would never do it and I know you would never do it, but he's just a comic man. That's what they do. And a good one. And he's a comic that's like known for saying like the most offensive one time I was doing, I do every year I do the uh, Doris Roberts, uh, children with AIDS benefit. So we do stand up. Kevin James does it sometimes. It's a good time. Sarah Silverman and we got up, we do, you know, 20 minutes in, in this big thing. And I called Gilbert to see if you wanted to do it. And Gilbert Gilbert's a great, you know, and I know him and he's, and he, but he just kept going, fuck that children and I go, no, but I said, it's a benefit for it go that Chels ran and ran.

Speaker 4:          00:25:57       I think he wouldn't stop saying that until I finally had to hey, I was like, oh fuck. So He seems like when he's on Howard stern that he very rarely has a real conversation. Right. What if this has to be funny? What did the same shit happened in California though? You're right, and then he did a joke about how much money we lost half of your friends. You're right. You're right. You're in a totally different with no, no, no. Right. You're right. There are guys in Japan and England. Everyone else that wouldn't be saying, I mean I agree with you that it would hurt, but I don't agree with you that he shouldn't be able to say it. No, you should say it, but you see, you put it on your Twitter and openly almost brag like, look, I'm being fucking edgy. I think he may know you're pushing it in your face. Like almost like being, I think Gilbert told me I had miscalculated and made an error in judgment. That's what twice he did it twice or three times.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       He did three different tweets. He did a bunch of them. Yeah. All right. He took them down. Unfortunately, I don't think it's the mother on TMZ. If anyone's looking for them, they're on TMZ is website. I think the second or third page, I mean, you know, I like Gilbert and I don't think he means what he says and I think he was just paying a comic. Yeah, and probably just push the envelope a little. Oh, we're apologists. So let me read it. He's really good on Jay. Like here's, here's what will Sasso wrote to me. This is literally like, I just, I'm just doing minding my own business and I get this text from him and this is our relationship and to speaking of kind of being able to joke around, he goes, you're a fucking meat pod. I go, what? What's a meat? Patty goes, AF, fucking anthropods made a meat.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       You're a fucking hero. You're a fucking all fours walking meat. Puppet. Hey, meaty, meaty mule. But it hang your slack face. True. Townline I can't even how you Mosey around on all fours turned the Muli go round. Hey Mule, get over here and lick these. My town of my ass. You guys sound like you're queer for each other. Well, let me read this. Jay Gilbert. Godfrey depend things. So you're like a little child over there. Here's one. Japan is really advanced. They don't go to the beach. The beach comes to them. I just split up with my girlfriend. But like the Japanese say there'll be another one floating by any minute now. Wow. That one's fucked up. You know? But whatever, man, if you're going to want these guys to say fucked up shit about other things, you're going to accept it when it's something that you know that either is close to home or hurt your feelings or, or you feel, I feel bad.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       I absolutely feel bad for the people that had, if they had to hear those jokes and they lost someone over there, absolutely. It's terrible. But you know, fuck. Is it worse? The joke is the joke actually make the idea of, I mean, how could you hurt anybody worse than losing a loved one? There's nothing worse than a joke is not gonna make it worse. I was thinking about that just to have your children, whatever. It just washed away. Washed dude. I watched some of those videos. It's so terrible. Some of those videos, there's the initial video where it breaks the wall and you see these boats come over the top of this wall, the seawall and start smashing through houses and it's like, whoa man. Like that is, it's unbelievable. It's such heavy duty fury. And then he realized how much fucking water is there out there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       It's an ocean, dammit. Why would you live so close to the ocean? You know, like I was in Malibu this weekend. We went to the, there's a place called Malibu seafood were nice place for, uh, you know, like this is a good little fresh seafood place in Malibu. And as we were driving, I was looking at all these houses that are like right on the beach and they're ridiculously expensive. You know, for a little tiny ass house it'd be like five, 6 million bucks, but they're really expensive in Malibu and malleable. And I'm like, wait a minute, they're on the beach. Like what kind of trust to you fuckers have you got trusted? That shit's going to stay there. Like, I remember the first time I ever was in a car, Hi Eddie Bravo was driving and we were in Redondo beach and we were going over this edge of this hill and I look off to the left hand side and I see the ocean and it was the first time it ever occurred to me how much fucking water that is just sitting right there. What we saw, the Japan Japanese thing was just a little, it was just like it moved in and sleep like the ocean.

Speaker 3:          00:29:57       Just how amazing was this videos, by the way, the houses just start just, I mean incredible, right? It makes you

Speaker 1:          00:30:02       really realize what could happen if, say there was a like a, an asteroid impact or you know, the Canary Islands that the east coast has to worry about the Canary Islands because apparently there's a volcanic shelf that if it drops off and it will, and it has in the past, drops off into the ocean, it will cause a fucking tidal wave that will drown everyone. A myelin on the east coast. The whole northeast coast is just going to get fucking slammed with this insane amount of water. You know, it's weird. Is that I, when, when I watched that that wave come through, I was, I thought, you know, if the houses could withstand it sort of, I mean they just go under locked, you know what I know, but instead it got all just up. Even like telephone poles got up the mass of that water is something I don't exactly push.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       Yes. It's like a huge, like, like the thing like the blob or whatever that, right, right, right. Yeah. Absorbs everything. Yeah. It's, it's, I mean it's got fucking cars and ours. Yeah. It's like a huge, like, um, meet Masha stuffed and there's so much energy behind it. I mean, didn't they say that the tsunami wave is traveling something like 500 miles an hour? I think when, when once they get an earthquake on the sh on the bottom of the ocean, the ripple effect can be as fast as six. They, I guess it's, yeah, as long as I can start underwater that, that fast. Like, fuck, man, it's just energy. I guess they said it created a, a breach that was, or I don't know what the word they use to describe it, but 50 miles wide and 270 miles long. That's how, how much moved on the bottom of the earth's surface. That's like those rogue waves when you're on a cruise, the Horse, he knows sometimes pluck a cruise ship. Dude, fuck that fuck that. I hated when I was on a creation that scares the shit out like that. Here's what I think about on cruises. What a perfect way for a maniac to randomly kill Peter's throwing people off the boat. Do you think, I've been on cruises at 12 at night noise on that deck and at least on the boat they don't have movies. What's that shit called?

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       What's that shit called? Where they say that people on boats sometimes like gaze out into the ocean and just jump off for some reason. Like there's like a term for retard. No, it they call it like oceans a dream or something like that. Like they get trapped by all night. Yeah. And it's probably, I always thought like it's probably doesn't exist. That condition is just people getting murdered in another ocean. The Odyssey though with the Odyssey when at this year

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       hell is not to look at the sirens or not to heat, listen to the sirens. Because if you listen to them, you'll jump in the water and try to, you'll, you'll try to call them and then you, you drown. And a lot of the men didn't cover up. Cover up their ears. Yeah, it was the sirens. And isn't there a Celtic myth about something like that as well? What was the o brother where art thou? When the women in the water, they sirens. What does that what they were, no, they were like, they were like temptresses I love me. Those are great. Stop. The Coen brothers are the best. Right? I forgive them even for movies that end with no ending because I loved when they just do weird shit. They just take chances. Barton Fink. Yeah. Great movie with John. John Goodman and John Turturro to Fargo.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       Man still holds up. Go back and watch this. Oh yeah. What the fuck bro? Alphas good. I was that last night. That doesn't have anything to do with what we're talking about. I've never seen alpha. I can't, I can't comment on it. I haven't told Pharos hilarious. You know what I did see I went to see red riding hood because of a fucking completely fixated on where it with a, I'm friends with the director of Red Riding Hood. Really? Really? Your friends with the chick who directed twilight, you wearing a tampon and play. Now I don't know where their husband or their boyfriend. Jamie.

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       Could you guys talk twilight and did we, did you ask her a series questions and retained you enjoyed the movie. Okay. Now, um, do you think that they really love each other or for me like I felt that, but I just, he's a fan. Tell me, please tell me that you got an insincere conversation with the woman who was the director of twilight about how great the movie was. No, we actually ended up playing running charades. Please tell me. I wish I had, she's cool man. She's really, I actually watched the first toilet and I didn't have a problem with it. I was like, well, it's not a bad movie, but there's been way worse movies. It's not for me. It's not my generation. It's for children. The second one, the book's amazing, Kendall, try to lift the boat. I got to the, I think it was the second one.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       I was like, all right, this is getting fucking dumb. Yeah. This, they dropped off substantially. Second first one was pretty decent and good job capturing that teenage anx, that Achy love. Yeah. It's like an Achy love sorta horror movie was kind of like Achy love, but more exciting than the usual whiny bullshit. Kristen Stewart. I don't know what it is about her, but I just wanted to, you know, she's my friend John's daughter. Really? Yeah. Jon Stewart was, uh, the, uh, the, I guess, I don't know his actual position. Assistant Director, I guess on a fear factor. He was the guy who organized everything on a sat. He said, great, super pro. He's one of these guys, talks like this. We got you over there, buddy. Have a seat. We'll be get shade and five get to you in five just always on the ball, you know, juggles the whole shit like a fucking champion.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Like we had a bunch of people that did that job and they will all stumbled and fucked up and people, it's just too much work. But this guy is like an old pro. He's been around forever. And he was telling me about his daughter doing some movie with Jodie foster. I'm like, Yo, why are you linking your daughter act? I know. What's that about? And then meanwhile listen to me, I mean his daughters now is like one of the most famous actresses in the fucking world and you know, she's probably made enough money to retire for the rest of our lives making a lot of money. She's so pretty. Something about her. I just find so like she doesn't try, she's just, she doesn't really even wear makeup. She just, she just is. So just so you know, there's so much to be said for people who can just be present and not, not try to do anything and not try to be [inaudible]. Before we start any conversation about a girl, I have to tell you that you know that you are always attracted to girls that look like then me cry.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       You're the guy who comes over and the girl is standing out in the rain and you and she looks like she's going to cry and you're like, hey, look what I found [inaudible] you let me get on my horse and ride over there and saving the Damsel. Loved that. That's the best. That's the funniest and best way to describe, uh, Giovanni, you and I have talked about this many times, but you'd never said I've had to, I had to rescue you a few times. I had to actively ignored you a couple times, which almost cost me my house. There was one time where I ran into Brian and Brian and I were in Hollywood and he said, Oh, I'm going to bring this girl bothered them date and I would love to see it. And she goes, hi, nice to meet you. And I shake her hand, look at him.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       I go, come here for a second. And I go, well, let's take them outside. I go, listen to me. I go, she's crossing crazy. I have like the most ridiculous, crazy radar. And when, when someone's, when there's something really wrong with someone, my body goes on red alert. What? She was on Meth when she met you? Yeah. Meanwhile I know, I didn't know what the hell, I just thought she had an energy squirly as fuck. As soon as she came over, dude, she was so off the charts bizarre and shaky and weird and she just, she's just saying hello to me. I pull him aside. All she said is, hello, nice to meet you. And then I go, Whoa, come here for a second. And I take him outside and I go, she's fucking critical. We let's get Outta here right now. Let's get out of here right fucking now just, you don't have to say goodbye to her.

Speaker 1:          00:37:34       Just call her Toni. You're never going to hang out with her again. Anyway, belonging and the story is chaos. All sorts of things happen. He breaks up with her and then many, many years later, how many years later was it that you saw her walking? Uh, tell the store, walking down the street, right about a year. Tell the story. Keep it Kinda, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's, we're on the DL when not name any names. Yeah, I know. No, it's just the date of a hundred methods. That's true. I could have been any one of them. My thing, uh, nothing really good comes out of that whole, that whole drug man. It's nobody ever said, hey, I did math and, and everything worked out. I just know the method advocates province and I did some math and everything. Just I got a new house and my body looks great. You know, it looks kept tricky though. What's tricky is that Adderall stuff, which is kind of like a speed, right? I mean, isn't that a form of speeds, cocaine, cocaine? I said that's where the kid is probably, that's what it felt. It feels like to me when I, when I did it, it just felt like I was on cocaine. Well that's probably because most of the cocaine you got was cut with an Arrow with speed. Speed. Oh yeah. Yeah. So

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       I think it's like a speed speeding. Yeah. Because I'm the late great Robert Schimmel. God bless him, rest his soul and all that good stuff. Great Guy. He, he told me once, I ran into him just randomly and he told me about accidentally taking someone's Adderall. He thought it was something else. He thought it was like his blood pills, you know, he had a heart attack and he thought it was a, and he had cancer. You know, he's had a lot of fucking serious health problems mixing, maybe didn't have a heart attack, maybe just a cancer. Anyway, he had some serious health problems and he, um, he, uh, took this Adderall by mistake and he called his doctor. He's like, Holy Shit, I think I took Adderall by mistake. What do I do? He said, he can't do anything. Just kick back and enjoy the ride because it's going to be with you for the next 12 hours, but you're going to be fine.

Speaker 5:          00:39:17       He goes for 12 hours. I just organize all my notes. He goes, I just started writing. He goes, I got so much shit done. Let you take it for it to be more clear. Yeah. Some people take it and it like add people usually take it. Yeah. Buddy minds on it. He's on it all day. He's, you know, him to it. We'll talk about it off the air, but he's on it all day. He's, he takes it all day, every day. He's prescribed by a doctor. Really? Yeah. I, I dunno, you know what specifically they said he needed it for it, but man, he's so fucking workaholic now, but it's like that fucking movie that's coming out with Bradley Cooper, you know, limitless where you take a pill and all of a sudden this pill makes you like super focused and that I'm sure they're going to come up with.

Speaker 5:          00:39:53       That's Adderall, Bro. I mean, there's a lot of fucking people on Adderall. I didn't even, I found out about Adderall when I was on fear factor because there was a pas, you know, production assistants and the production assistants. Um, we're all, uh, like college kids, you know, they were all like doing it. Like a lot of them were, you know, they're doing it for a, you know, just getting out of school first Gig and they're doing it, you know, as a part of the classes. Um, and uh, they would start talking about how they would take Adderall and while they're in school. So I was like, you know, kids are taking Andrew like, what are you doing? And they're like, oh my God, I can't even go to school without Adderall. I was like, what? Like what are you talking about? It's what I thought was interesting about that.

Speaker 5:          00:40:29       You see that documentary bigger, faster, stronger. Yes. And you know, people say, well, you're taking steroids and then ended up be gene doping and all kinds of things and pretty soon I have nano technology that kind of oxygenates your blood. But, but, but, but they said, you know, steroids or illegal, but yet performance can take Beta blockers for example, that actually keep them from getting nervous where the debate really, and they really, they're allowed, that's legal. I mean, you know, if apparently, I mean an orchestra, one of the guys was an orchestra violinist and he takes Beta blockers because it helps him. He otherwise he doesn't get nervous. He's much better at playing. The issue is that is a performance enhancing drug. You could, you could make the argument and, right, but that's like the difference between violins and steroids. It's a pretty big into question but, but, but the, the debate's still is they're both performance enhancing drugs. One, make sure muscular cause that's what was required in your particular endeavor. Right? Whereas the other one, make sure your fingers are more relaxed, whatever it might be. It's just an interesting debate. You kind of go, where do you draw the line? I say personal freedom is where you draw the line. I think you should be able to do whatever you want to do. If you want to take Adderall and write books all day, good for you. Why would I get into the choice? It's

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       like, it's like when Bloomberg in New York, Mayor Bloomberg made restaurants where we're not allowed to, um, uh, provide foods that had trans fats. I believe. I don't know if that law went to, but that was the, that was the exactly. Our Trans fats. I think trans fatty acids with penises. No, I think twins. Brian just knocked it out of the park. There it is. That's why he's here folks. I think it's like, I think I'm partially, I think I partially hydrogenated oils, whatever it is, it's not good but delicious. Right. You know what I mean? I don't want to be able to eat. Not good but delicious. Sometimes you fuck, you're going to make a trans fats illegal. Let's go. Let's, let's make up two things. Let's take white flour and sugar. We charge a real fucking cigarettes man. Before they even touch you. Draw the line.

Speaker 4:          00:42:22       White flour and sugar. Make some delicious donuts. That's where you draw the line. Eat too many of them. You'll get diabetes, so give me a break. You're going to make it. You can't. You got to figure out where to draw the line and you start with water. Yeah. People should be able to make their own choices based on the information that they can. And nowadays everybody can get information and I'm always amazed as somebody, people don't spend more time taking a look at what they put in their bodies. But some people worry about what access to children. This is like the big word. Yeah, yeah, I hear that about adults. But what about my kids? I don't want my kids who worry. It's never been, it's never not been a worry that the answer to that is not to take away adult's ability to choose things for themselves.

Speaker 4:          00:43:02       It doesn't make the world a safer place. You want to try and make the world a safer place. You let's, let's, let's take one example. Lower the speed limit is 36 miles an hour. It'll save lives. I can measure that for you. Mathematically. You want to lower the speed limit? No. B We're going to, we're going to have it at 55 65 because that's the way life. That's the s the pace life moves at. And by the way, people die at that pace but nobody's going to slow down. Cause the slow down is ready, not worth it. So you're putting a price on human life, which we do every single day as a society and we have to, that's an interesting way to put it. You could spend more money on airlines. You could spend actually more money to really, really triple safe guard planes. You could actually do, it wouldn't be worth it because price for everybody would go up and you wouldn't able to fly that way. It's it's we do. We make these decisions subconsciously and consciously every single day. My friend Johnny used to said, why don't they put a big parachute at the top of the plane?

Speaker 4:          00:43:56       It's like such a smart thing that great. I thought about that. I'm like God dammit. That's like some gene shit, don't they let even talks about it. I like when they find that when they, when they find that black box as like why don't they just make the whole plane I made out of the same shit. Those hack in 87 it sure was. Well, what are they at least give you parachutes her, you know, like underneath your seat just in case if you fucking way, Bro, 500 miles an hour, you're fucked. Fall out of the sky. We usually, most plane crash has happened on takeoff and landing, so that's, that's so they're, your peer at parachutes can not going to do shit. It's not like you're in the air and the light you need

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       is some sort of a adamant Tanium to shit that wolverines bones is made out of like a shield that you put around you on impact because impact they, the percussion. Your brain would be you, maybe you or just the, my brain would be fine, bro. Or just a huge shot of heroin with bubbles and stuff. I got padding. Maybe you brought her, Joe's getting competitive. You, he's going to competitively. Oh, can take more impact. This is a stupid conversation. I hate this podcast.

Speaker 3:          00:44:58       What? Last night when I was a showrooming and went outside and looking at the stars when you're showrooming is the most fucking amazing thing in the whole entire world. They were just pulsating.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       You're riding a dolphin right now to put according blowing him talking pin over right now, writing and Unicorns licking his ass. He's got, hey around his asshole on the Unicorn slick here as I frolic. I want to share him every day. Don't think that's good for you, for him. I think that's what happened to the Mayans. That's my latest. I have this bit about the Mayans, about the mines. Uh, you know the reason why they came up with this end of the world, shit, there were fucking doing mushrooms and like staring at space all day. Like there's a certain amount of mushrooms you should stop at and whatever the fuck the Mayans did cause they disappeared. You know, the people, the Mayan people are still there. That's what's weird. When I went to cheat you an Eatsa, I went and uh, one of them went on the tour of the ruins and everything like that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       There's people there that look like those Mayan sculptures. There's like pick people there that have those Mayan features and they're really tiny people. It's really bizarre. So the Mayans, it's not like they all died off, but whatever. The fuck they were doing was so crazy that it got to a point with human sacrifices just fell apart doing human sacrifice. I call that pretty crazy and raiding other villages in a might've been a lot of it might've been that they were just getting fucked up on mushrooms all the time and just go to war on mushrooms and we knew the Vikings went to Warren Mushrooms. They will become very Scotts. The Scotts they call them deserves. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what mushroom they took. I'm sure someone on Twitter will tell us, but I think it was the Amanita Mascara, which is the one that's linked to Siberia and Santa Claus and cause they would get naked rain, make it and they say they'd cry a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       Yeah. Well you know, listen man, if you've fucking put yourself on the right mixture, you know and you've got to go to war, you put yourself on some crazy next dimension. Mixture. No, you have to go to war. We think of war. It's like something to be avoided. But when you're in your living in one a d it's, there's no avoiding it. Is this dude's with swords and they're coming on horses and we got to get a spear. When the weird thing is, the way they went, they would fight. I always think about this, the fine line. Do you want me to charge into all of that? That, that all those blades to just fight like that? It's high. I'd be waiting. I want to be the sniper I want to be. There was no avoiding that. That shit happened. I've learned the bone Arrow quick. Yeah, but even that man, eventually someone's gonna run up on you and hack your leg off. It's a bad way to God, a crazy way to go to all those fucking Braveheart movies. Two armies, they meet across a field and they just run at each other now, but they really walk it like that.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       At least they had the anesthesia in antibiotics by the time. Right. I didn't stop to bend over to tie my shoe in my metal shoe laces. Do you how sucky it was lived back then. Oh, you died a things like tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, small pop up, starvation and animal attacks, starvation animal attacks. Other other like countries coming in and going, hey, we're going to kill you and enslave your kids and rape you are wise.

Speaker 5:          00:47:58       No. What people have forgotten about man wolves is all this talk level. We're going to save the wolf. The wolf are amazing. Majestic creatures. Yeah. Wolf's used to eat fucking kids, man. There's a reason why all these little Red Riding Hood with that movie that I saw, all of these things would though the three little pigs you use the reason why there's wolves and all these children's stories cause wolves would fucking eat your kids there. They're out there man. And they're getting stronger and bigger. Do you hear about the wolf pack in Siberia or in uh, it was somewhere in the Soviet Union but we're forming. So wherever Russia, whatever it's called now

Speaker 4:          00:48:32       400 a found meet. Uh, they had found bear DNA and they're at feces. They were killing bears, right?

Speaker 5:          00:48:37       Well no, that's the one I'm talking about. I'm talking about this a pack of Super Wolves who was 400 wolves in this Russian town and they were killing horses that were ganged up cause it got so cold apparently that all the animals that they prey on died. So they started breaking into places and killing horses and there's 400 of them acting as a superpac first of all,

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       living in Siberia in the wintertime. And they, and they're like, hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:49:00       Well I'm not sure if it's Iberia at somewhere. Obviously incredibly cold in Alaska because everything died. Everything froze to death. Now isn't that a lot of freezing to death lately, man in Japan or in Vietnam? 7,000 fucking uh, I think it was oxen, oxen or what are some wild cow or something? Whatever the fuck it was, but 7,000 large animals died. Wow. You know, I mean with, while these, these massive die offs, you know, that that's happening this year. I mean all of them together. I don't remember. I don't remember any die offs.

Speaker 4:          00:49:30       Just a few employees happen, I think. And I think in nature you always have dives. And by the way, you also always have viruses that come in and wipe out, for example, wild dog of Africa and that that dog, you know a lot of, from what I've read and seen, I believe they get, one of them gets this temper and then the whole pack dies. You know, they just spread it back and forth. I have a dog that had to stamp her. It was scary as fuck. It's scary.

Speaker 5:          00:49:52       A rescue dog. He was a doberman and he was real sweet and then all of a sudden out of nowhere, man, he just started snapping at me and growled at me and I was a little kid. I was like 11

Speaker 4:          00:50:02       one of the great things we've done as human beings and the 20th century is really checked. Most pathogens, most diseases like that we have, we have come up with a bill, an ability to really make them slim to vanishing in our everyday lives. Who, when was the last time you knew anybody who died of a disease? And if you read any kind of literature, any literature, pick up any book from, from even 1948, even though even if you place there, there was always, everybody had dealt with different kinds of play, whether it was influenza in this, in the worldwide influenza that hit this country in a very, very hard in the 20s or, um, or polio, which put the countless children, thousands of children in, in on iron lungs. They died. And then they lost their, their ability to walk. And the, our own president, I mean, our own president of the United States got polio and was in a wheelchair. Now think about that. You know, um, when he was governor of New York, uh, Theodore Roosevelt, I'm sorry, it was, um, uh, Franklin Roosevelt was, uh, was, you know, uh, I think he was coming to New York. Yeah, it was, and, but he was basically walking and standing and then he got polio when he was at the height of his power and yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:51:15       at the height of his powers when he caught it. Yeah, yeah. Written. Then he became president. I said, there's no doubt that it's the safest time to live ever. There's never been a time like this, you know, with all the violence that we have, think of the population, the population has dramatically increased. When people say, well, things aren't like they were in the Sevis motherfucker. Do you know how many more people there are than the were in the 70s in the 70s there was probably only 3 billion people in the world or something. The other thing is amazing is we've figured out ways to harness food like you know, India wide swaths of India and Southeast Asia and especially in China, went through terrible famines and never had enough to eat and a lot of that, a lot of that stuff is a memory. Thank it seems to me though that these things are happening much more frequently.

Speaker 5:          00:51:55       I would like to think that it's just because of our access to information that we have with the Internet and Twitter and all these things. So what we find out about disasters, whether it's in Chile, whether it's in China, whether it's a New Zealand, find about him, find out about them in real time. But I don't buy that. And Man, I feel like there's more. I mean, I guess someone should do the research or maybe somebody already has and I just need to find the site. But there's, I think more things are happening now than I can ever. I think. I think I'm trying to be objective,

Speaker 4:          00:52:20       but I think we all have a tendency as human beings also number one to first of all, I don't think there's ever been a time in history when people weren't predicting the end of our race shore. And now, and I'm talking about first century, the first centuries, pharisees, I mean, you know, are the scenes. I mean that the, in the Bible, that's what they talk about. They were apocryphal, you know, and, and, uh, that is, that is so much a part of our nature, I think, not only to always imagine disaster and prepare for disaster, but to predict disaster. And, and I think that, um, the one thing that's for sure is that you will always deal with these, what they call black swans, these sorts of aberrations that come out of nowhere and take the whole chess board and throw it in the air. And that is as much about the human experience as anything else. And I think that if you always keep in mind that all this can be taken away from you or can change you or can throw your what, what your, your whole contract that you came to this table with in the rip it to shreds.

Speaker 5:          00:53:23       Is that a problem? No one's that contract.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       This is the real problem with human beings. We all just exist and we don't really think about what the fuck is truly going on until something nutty happens. That's right. And by the way, remember a lot of psychiatrists to tell you that all, all of us come to the table with a contract. Like we, we, we, we all make deals with ourselves. We say, if I work really hard, I'm going to get this job. If I work really hard, I'm going to get famous. If I remember the how to get, I'll, I'll make a lot of money and a lot of times life doesn't work that way for a whole myriad of reasons. A lot of times, by the way, it's because people aren't honest with themselves and don't realize what they're actually good at versus what they want to be good at. We see that a lot with acting and all these things, but I think you see it everywhere and but, but at the end of the day, most of us, it's really interesting the social scientist because they'll say, well a lot of times we have a contract come to the table and we say, this is what happens.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       We get older, it doesn't happen. But human beings are also really, really good at creating what they call synthetic happiness. They can, they can, they can assess what they got now versus what they did want and they realized it didn't work out and then they'll just start to really love what they like. There's social sciences did a really interesting study between people who won the lottery and then people who became um, uh, paraplegics and he and he measured their sort of happiness on a broad sort of scale, uh, a year later and found that there were both in the same place because the people in a wheelchair, I had done such a good job of embracing their new reality. And that just means a lottery winners or retards. That's all I'm saying. It's crazy. But he was, you got know if you won the lottery, dude, you'd be way happier than you'd be if you were in a wheelchair, unless you're an idiot.

Speaker 4:          00:54:55       Well, but I'm just saying it's human beings human. It's more a comment on the people in the wheelchair who are able to kind of what I was saying, man, when I was saying that the people aren't exactly aware of what's going on. Here's the deal. We live in a society that was collected over the course of hundreds of years of innovation. It's created all of the work of millions of people that you've never met, right. And all of their combined efforts and discoveries have allowed you to live this really simple and easy life and that's what we're all doing and we are all raising children with the same ignorance that we have about what this is all about in this country, in this country, in all countries. No one knows what the next stage of this existence. I think for example, if you look at India and then you look at China and especially India, India is becoming a real hot bed of innovation and those kids work.

Speaker 4:          00:55:45       They, I mean there's a their slaves. No, they weren't. I call them when my Dell computer doesn't work, but they're smart and a lot of that innovation is coming out of India. I'm sure there is man and what all I'm sure it is what I'm saying. What I'm getting at is no one has earned this life that we live right now. No one that's alive has, it's a collective effort, but as individuals, very few of us are even putting into perspective normal things like our own mortality, the mortality of a very climate, the mortality of, of the structure and the shape of the continents. I think because it a lot of, and a lot of ways we're more comfortable today than we ever have been. Plenty to eat. You can go away biology, you don't worry about these disease. Do you even really have to worry about war?

Speaker 4:          00:56:26       For the most part, that's new in our country. Remember in 2011 if you take even 1985 half the world was under communist dictatorships who were, who had their missiles pointed directly at our major cities. That doesn't exist anymore. There really is for all intensive purposes. One superpower, one military superpower in the world and Russia is no longer a threat. Think about that. We now have NATO. Most of the eastern European countries that were our enemies are actually part of NATO. Now, who do you talk about? North Korea and Iran? Maybe significant to an extent, but certainly nothing like the threat that the Soviet Union was. So I think people, you're right. I think people for the most part are a lot more relaxed and, and, and feeling a lot more secure. Anything is better now. People are smarter now. People are nicer now. People are more aware and informed.

Speaker 4:          00:57:11       Now they're more aware of their own mental and psychological problems. We're fatter now. Bigger asses. Now the question becomes what's the balance like? How much discomfort do you have to experience, to beat, to be great? Because I think greatness does come out for it to a large extent. Out of doesn't come out of comfort and luxury. I think it does, but sometimes it can just come out of discipline. Well, they're struggling. That discipline. If you can be the type of person that really, you know, you don't have to be living a terrible life. That's right. You're right. Good stuff. You know, you can be living a great life as long as you're disciplined and you really tune yourself into it as you're right. Yeah. You know, but you were talking, I thought I had a thought. You were talking about how, you know, genetic suck and pretty soon, you know, we're going to be able to kind of choose our genetics.

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       But the question becomes, you know, I think of myself well, but the problem with that is that so much. I'm worried that we'd lose our color cause so much of what I do and what drives me worried really is the white color white people. No, no, no color. Like color flavor, flavor. Oh, nice. Recovery. Not Color. I mean like our flavor hour, hour. Because, because, because so much of what we do, so much of what I do, what drives me is that I'm compensating for my inadequacies or my perceived inadequacies that that's why I worked out. That's why I did martial arts. That's why I wrestled. I felt like I was sort of, but it's always from the childhood, the place that a performer comes from. Yeah. And me too. And everyone, we know, everyone we know that's a comic. There's always, but what I'm saying is in some ways, God bless a dysfunctional childhood.

Speaker 4:          00:58:41       Yeah. And no, because you're one of a hundred that didn't, you know, there's a hundred like you that smashed on the rocks and the way up to the top of the cliff. You managed to bite through vines with your teeth and get to the top and you took a deep breath and now you're okay. But you didn't have to be okay. I needed to die. Anyone with a fucked up childhood, like the idea of encouraging a fucked up childhood to create an innocent child. What did you really mean? That's really what you're saying, but the trick of light truly isn't. The trick of life isn't the trick of life to turn to turn that which is bad into something good. Yes, it is the trick, but some people fail at that trip and then we have criminals wandering through the streets that are dangerous and emotionally get matched.

Speaker 4:          00:59:17       It's very easy to destroy the human being. It's not hard at all. And they'll just raise him terrible. Yup. You know what I mean? When you, it's always like some feral child and Russia. You hear about raised by dogs, you know like, oh wait, fuck right. You just stop and think about it. Like with the, for the kid's been eating dead birds and shit for dogs, dogs but like poodles or something like that. Like what's so weird about contemplating like disaster, like the one in Japan, any disaster or any, anything has a ripple effect. And, and the crazy thing is that that sometimes to one person's loss is another person's opportunity. It's just that dance that constantly goes back and forth and there's one side, something terrible happens and it opens up a whole new world and opportunity for a whole nother group of people.

Speaker 4:          01:00:02       You know, whether it's up, somebody opens a, I dunno, a company that provides quick relief and now he's employed 60 people who can feed their kids, whatever the case. It's just this constant dance man. And whenever you try to pinpoint or treat life like it's a noun, you're, you're in trouble. And by the way, your relationships are a verb. Everything is a verb. Everything is always moving. Everything is in flux. You are too. Absolutely. That's the whole thing is there's nothing static, but that's what everybody looks at is the problem with the contract with coming to the table with the contractors. They look for that moment where they can stop now, man. I think, I think if you keep growing and you keep yourself, you keep surprising and shocking yourself and maybe even scaring yourself, which is hard to do. But if you sound like an actress right now, have to sing a song, dude, got away on my song, you know, selling some new chick the next blockbuster terracing about why the fuck I am beautiful.

Speaker 4:          01:00:54       The worst earthquake, you know, everyone's talking about what Gilbert Gottfried said. No one is, no one said dumber shit than what's Sharon Stone said? Well, half the Chinese earthquake, or do you remember that? She said, maybe you know, I'm friends with the Dalai Lama. You know, maybe this earthquake in China is Karma because they're of the terrible things they've done for Tibet. Wow. I remember that. You think innocent people thought squashed by rocks, all that you know, and she's a name drop and little Twat. I'm fencing Itali Lama sure asked you a hooker thinks about you all the time. Concert when he's doing his mantra. He was like, Sharon Stone, Sharon Stone, you know Sharon, you know the girl basic instinct actresses? No, excuse me. You mean the girl from above the law, the Steven Seagal debut movie actors including me. Look at the fact that we worship actors. The funniest thing in the way, if an alien came down, they'd be like, wait a minute.

Speaker 4:          01:01:46       You're worshiping these people who are basically good at being emotionally available and pretending is, is that really something that I, it's a skill. It tells a good story there. Part more impressive that. Or Golf. Golf. Golf takes unlikely though. But I like movies and Tiger Woods probably can't act fuck golf. I love, I don't know man. I think both are equally ridiculous and I've always said that it's one of the funniest things in the world that people think that's a guy's a hero because he hits a ball into a hole in the ground. But you know what I mean? So silly. We don't really like about any comp comp, competition, golf or any game is that it requires when you want to win at that game, it requires you to do basically do all that self examination, that a face up to all your your obstacles.

Speaker 4:          01:02:29       You got to deal with your performance anxiety. You know how it is to try to get better. You see the signers to choke. That's the point of competition. I probably would love golf. That's what I'm terrified but I played pool. That's the only ever don't ever pick up a golf. Don't ever take Guilford. Going to I know how to only chess either for the same reps. For those of you guys who don't, who don't know this about Joe Rogan I, well I always said most of the public actually doesn't knows very little about Joe. For example. He can, he can draw really well. He's at a notch below probe to clarify. He is. He is. He but he's, he knows more about pool and he's, he's actually a really good draftsman. You can draw like really, really well. I've been wanting to do when I was in high school before I got into martial arts.

Speaker 4:          01:03:09       But I mean, but and so, so the comic book on you're a great lunch, you're real, you're a real martial artist. You'd be a nightmare to fight you. You can, you can draw a really well and you, um, short, balding, Short, balding donkey assholes. Never as clean. Are you not wearing pants? CELEXA layered underneath. But wait, I was, there was a point I was making and I'm too high to remember it. Dammit. Um, pool playing games. But the problem is that you're so intense that once you pick something up, it's like that game quake when you played for 15 passed out as you were leaving your eye. He drags me to the store and he's getting these handles and did, he's like 30, he's getting, he's getting his handles and all these like weird things. It's, and I was like, what are you doing? What's all these?

Speaker 4:          01:03:52       What are these, what are these grips and stuff? He goes, it's for quake a playing somebody in Sweden tomorrow I will crush him. And I was like, whatever. What the thousand yard stare, dude, that'd be play connect to you. You have no idea how we've talked about this in the podcast way too many times, but a quick is too fun. Quake is even more involving than pool. I won't allow my son's to those games because they're too good. Now, like gears of war, like we cliffy be put up an epic games put up the, uh, unreal three engine, the new engine, they put up a demo. Fucking hey man, it just doesn't, it looks real. It looks like a fucking movie, man. It's so, I do this joke now about, about, um, how we're fighting wars now like that, you know, like with songs and stuff, the guys in Nevada and Florida, think about that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:37       You're killing somebody 5,000 miles away, but it's a video game and you're actually taking life. You wonder what that does to you psychologically when you come home and you're eating dinner. But, but I was at, my joke was like, in 20 years, the word hero is not going to be the grizzled guy with the shaved head and the scars. Can it be the Chubby dude with huge thumb muscles who smells like Doritos. We'd, well that's true. You Starfighter remember the movie where the kid had to get really good at a video game and when he got good at it, they came down and took him to fight in the galaxy. It's going to be, well these Pakistan drone things are fucking frightening because it's such a gray area too. It's like we're not really in Pakistan, but we are in the sky above pag and, but there's no one in the plane and, and you hear it.

Speaker 4:          01:05:16       This, when I was in Afghanistan, I wash those things taken off all the time. I was like, look at that thing. It's, it's not even, it's not even manned. It just takes off dude. Hell fire missiles. That's all you need to know. What are you doing buddy? This cliff VBS, epic games, Infinity Blade video game. They go through, they go through like that Hellfire missile, I think. I believe somebody told me you can go like a foot of steel or something like off of steal. The idea behind it is so crazy that you can just pilot something from halfway across the world in real time and trust it to just eat your pro. You pull the trigger and only the beginning. How much of a delay is the lag? There has to be some lag. Well I don't know. You can actually watch it on the interview cause that was a, that's a big thing about playing online.

Speaker 4:          01:05:59       When you play on line it's all about your pain and if you have like one ping or two paying, like you're in the server, you're local to the matter anymore though so fast. That doesn't mean what you need makes a big difference would ping is in milliseconds. It absolutely matters. It's the guy with a higher paying than you can still beat you. But you definitely have an advantage when you're local. Like say if this is like say if we set up a server in my house, right and I set up a server and I'm here connected to the machine, but other people have to connect and get the information through the Internet. So they're paying, say if they're down the block at the lowest they're going to get is maybe a 10 this is back in the day. I don't know if it's changed, but yeah, 10 pin.

Speaker 4:          01:06:37       If you're lucky, but that's cause you're here, but if you're in Sweden or somewhere like that, no doubt about it, you're going to have a slight delay. It might be 150 milliseconds. It might be 200 milliseconds. It won't be a full second. That's unbearable. You can't do that. 250 milliseconds is where it gets squirrely. Like you can't really weird that does the human human reaction can get to the point where you can't make like you can barely measure it. Like when they do sprinting, you know, how would the Olympics, you know when they, you know why they shoot the gun? They shoot a comment. That's for a sound. That's for a fact. They actually, if you're a, if you're running a hundred like Usain bolt and you're, you're in a rice, they, they have that. They shoot that sound off behind you. Why? Because it's got to reach all the guys at the same time.

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       You shouldn't like this. The guy at the end is the last to hear about it and they're so fast off the blocks that they, the other guy's already already going to win the race. You didn't hear it in time. So they, they, they, they found that when they shot back in the day, they'd be shooting it here. The guy closest to gun all would always have this advantage. And so now, and even when they, they send that sound off now behind these guys, the problem is the sound dissipates to here. So it starts, you know, you gotta have it, you gotta have, it originates somewhere. How do you get it to all of them at the exact same second cause they're so fast off the blocks, you're actually giving the guy who hears it first and advantage and they win. It's like, it's like the guy and check this out.

Speaker 4:          01:08:00       You know, the difference between fourth place and first place in the downhill ski event was in a, in a, you know, whatever it was. It was two planks of an I can't gain it says what? Ready Gold, gold, gold, nothing. Gold. Nothing. Whoa. Nothing. That's fucking not, that's why swimmers trimmed their fingernails. That's what he's and he's don't don't trim. They try to get their finger nails long. Why? To Act as like a little paddles notes so that you can touch because it's you're dealing with a hundredth of a second. Watson can grow pimp nails. You tried it, you tried it. It's all computerized. The minute you touch that and say if you were touching like who some are Paul horror as you'd be a terrible swimmer because he wasn't real. Have that big reach guys or albatrosses. That's fucking fast. That's how fast human being how, okay.

Speaker 4:          01:08:48       Let me ask you this. How many of those guys do you think are doping? How many of those guys in Olympic competition? I don't think it's possible to compete in in a lot of Olympic sports without doping and without doing drugs. Yeah, like cycling. There's no way. Why do you think all of them, why do you think all of them get caught? All of them. The biggest. It's the biggest joke. I mean, you know, but, but, but you're going after Lance Armstrong Bro. I'm sure they're going after him. This is, which is weird. It's like they get them on lying, which is a very strange thing. It's like women, if you're going to put people in jail for lying, how about most of the government? You know, fuck can't in a lie. Nobody ever got went to jail for taking steroids. But people who have gone to jail for lying to the government about, and if they take him his money away or if they take, you know, say that you know, you did some stuff that was against the rules and you know, you should be fine and we can prove that that's one thing.

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       But they're going after him to lock him up, man. They're going after him till to set an example and lock him up for something that everyone's doing it. Everyone is doing, especially in cycling, I remember he wouldn't be arrested for doing steroids. They wouldn't lock them up for that. They would lock him up for committing. Perjury is a big diff weird, right? That's how they got al Capone. That's how they get it, right? The word no, the got him on tax evasion case against Barry Bonds is that the case is you perjured yourself on the stand, right. Where does that like what? You have to tell us the truth and if you don't it's a crawl. You don't know. You have to, you know you have the right to take the fifth right. But as you can say nothing, which is what one of the great things about our, you know our system, you can actually not, you can choose to not incriminate yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:10:16       I have, I refused to speak cause I don't want to incriminate myself and that's right, but don't they lock people up when they do that? You can be locked up if you are given, I believe now I'm not legal scholarship. It's a scholarship that they're doing that all the time. I believe you can be locked up is if you have evidence and the government subpoenas that evidence and you refuse to speak. If you say, I'm not telling them my friend, you can go to jail for that. They can put you in jail for that. And they have, they put a journalist in jail because she wouldn't divulge her sources. And I believe that was in the Valerie Plame case. That's creepy shit. She said, I'm not going to divulge who told me these con that this person was a CIA operative or whatever and she went to jail.

Speaker 4:          01:10:57       And then scooter Libby, I, I'm, I'm not sure if I'm getting all my facts right, but scooter Libby, they'd find it. Turns out was pardoned by the president later on, but convicted of, um, telling, uh, divulging a, an agent, a u s agents identity to a non authorized person, uh, which is a crime in this country. It's so bizarre how many different people we have all over the world that are in military bases and you know, that are, that are, uh, government operatives in the United States. And we have them positioned all over the world to kind of keep an eye on every, always have, you know, and it comes from the Cold War and it's a dangerous place, but the real issue becomes what is, what is the u s is strength has always been, not that it's power comes from the barrel of a gun in the u s has its influence innovation, but mostly it's a beacon of hope where you can come here and if you got the stuff and you got the metal, you might just be a millionaire.

Speaker 4:          01:11:50       That is something that resonates throughout the entire world and always has. I wanted to ask you this because you've got some experience in the Middle East. What do you think is happening with all these different places with I saw your radio with Egypt. I think it's a thing and it's a human thing and I'll tell you what I think mostly most of all, I think that you heard a lot of analysts and professionals and people who follow this stuff and people who are so called experts and the, I used to always hear something that they used to always say this democracy's not synonymous with Islam. You'd hear that all the time. And I think what this proves is that democracy, and let me, let me define democracy, that the desire for representative government, let's just take that, the, the life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I just let me pursue whatever it is.

Speaker 4:          01:12:33       Those constantly being able to speak my mind, being able to petition my government, being able to say something against my government, being able to, to all the things we take for granted. Those are human rights and, and they are not, they are not American rights. They are human rights. And, and this proves that you can say whatever you want about Islam or anything else or any other religion. Human beings want a better life for their children. Human beings would choose to have representative government over a dictatorship like Hosni Mubarak or, or a dictatorship like the, the royal family essentially is in Saudi Arabia. Don't tell me any human being wants to live that way. I find it very inspiring that one man and Tunisia lit himself on fire. You want to talk about a ripple effect lit himself on fire because they took away his license. I believe he was selling fruit and he said, enough is enough.

Speaker 4:          01:13:19       He was so desperate and he said, I'm going to make an example. This is my protest. You want it, you want to take everything from me, I'll light myself on fire. And I don't think that's a good move. But that was a spark that caused that, that, that, that said, that said, we don't have to be afraid anymore. We don't have to beat, we don't have to cringe. And and saying that these governments like, like Egypt in both places where they have with a military and secret police come in and do some pretty awful things to you that takes real guts. So I think it's a real, I think this is a, um, an incredible time in the sense that the Middle East is changing. It really is changing and it's the really is the Internet nation. Of course it is, but you can't keep information away from people.

Speaker 4:          01:13:55       You can fool the people sometimes you can fool all the people. Sometimes it can be some of the people all of the time. You can't fool all the people all the time. Except North Korea who said that? I believe that was Abe Lincoln, right? Yeah. Who knows what the fuck ain't really said. You know, Abraham Lincoln was a racist. I'm just trying to encourage black people to move to South America because they wouldn't get along with white page. It's actually more complicated than that, but I think it's more complicated than that. Of course he is sweet. He's slept with dudes. Do. Why is he slept with dudes? They slept in bed together. Stay warm. Wow. This is no big deal. You got to do what you gotta do, man. You live in fucking prairie pioneer days out of speedos and you're gonna call me gay. What's an Abe Lincoln? A wrestler.

Speaker 4:          01:14:32       He was very strong. He was about six, four and he was very, very strong. They said he used to be able to hold an acts like one of those big butch having acts out for like longer than anybody else with his arms straight like that. He was a real wirey strong dude. Straight with his on what a weird competition that it's back of the day. They'd get all this is hopscotch hard things, right? Like you know, let's see a whole hind quarter of a mule up above your head. Now you know how to be a first guy back then to try to wrestle a bear too. I always think about that stuff. Who wrote a bull who said, hey, you know what? Throw a testicle essential on that bull. I'm going to get up on him and see how long is that originated and is that an American tradition?

Speaker 4:          01:15:07       Well, I probably started in smelled Spain. They were like knocking like a ride and I'm just going to kill it with a sword. It's pretty bad ass. Yeah. You know what bothers me about that though, man, is a bunch of other dudes helping out. Oh well, because there's, because you know the Madeira Bull, I think it's called the Madeira evil. Hemingway wrote a book called death in the afternoon and he kind of takes each, brings you through what a what a fighting bulls about. You're not allowed in Spain, you're not in. And some of you guys listening to his, I just check this out. You're not allowed in Spain to approach a fighting bull on foot. You must approach it on a bicycle, motorcycle or car. You know why? Because Bulls figure out the way you move. And if you, if they watch you walking around all the time and running around, when you put them in a, in a, in, in the, in the ring with the Matador, that manager doesn't have a chance because they figured you out.

Speaker 4:          01:15:52       The first time [inaudible] ever sees a human being on two feet by law in Spain is when he's put out there in front of that matador. And by the way, they got rubbed out there, got to rub his eyes with pepper to keep them a little bit blind. They gotta, they gotta pick a deal is coming there and stab him in the back so he can't lift his head. So he's got these spears in is, it's pretty brutal. They've got to disable that bull before on the human being has any shot, any shot at fighting, it didn't shut and they still die. They still die when they say, when you're a matador in Spain, that's where you are. Forget girls, forget music for a house. Your life is about the bowl fog. Is there a lot of money and being an amount of door, um, there's a, there's huge glory and money and you're, you're a national hero if you're good.

Speaker 4:          01:16:37       And by the way, it's probably like the UFC start with like, you know, guys were fighting with blunt horns and then all the way up to the big show, but, but um, but you know, when they used to pit bulls with bears gives you used to always win. Oh, I would say to the bowl. I would say every time there is so strong there are, there's utilizers touched one. You ever been on one? If you've written a book. No, but I've touched, I've been to settle rich. Same thing sorta. So Lisa, when we were doing fear factory, we made people ride bulls one day. It was the scariest it's ever been. Uh, any, any day of filming. This was one day where I felt like we crossed the line. I was like, what? Are you doing? Dangerous. They are not. They're like, they're bold. They were, this was the, their argument.

Speaker 4:          01:17:20       These are training bowls. They're not as aggressive. What does that bowl, no, he's a fucking training. But I didn't know you were a poet by meter where the bull whispers he around. I love when people think they know what an animal is. I love when they have Christ strand. It's tiger won't bite you. You were talking about it to me in the kitchen. We're talking about that grizzly trained bear, that tour the, uh, I think it was his trainer, his brother or cousin, her cousin. And it killed him in a couple of seconds. It was horrible. So weird because that's a 1500 pound bear, grabbed a hold of an [inaudible] in a lazy way. And the poor guy, I guess he's pretty aggressive. I mean obviously the guy must've so scary what it represented to the bear. But he was represented some sort of a threat. Well apparently though he's, he was doing what he's supposed to do and I guess the guy didn't have his arms up or something and they bear ended up grabbing onto his neck and his instinct took over and he said, oh, I'm going to shake you to death, which is Tara's supposed to have your arms up.

Speaker 4:          01:18:09       I don't know. I don't got to stick them up, pose my bear wrestling. And I'm a white belt still. I'm still so what do you think the fuck is going on with all these mass deaths? There's a million fish die in the Redondo Beach Harbor. All these animals that have died and birds that are falling from the sky, I think, cause you don't see, I don't know. But I would imagine, I would imagine we have a very polluted at a environment and probably is a combination of all those chemicals in the environment and chemicals are being made. You know, we're very good at coming up with synthetic material and synthetic chemicals. And what we're probably not as good at and what the FDA could never do is figuring out how all these chemicals when put together interact or how they, what they do to, to, to Mitoplasma and if that's even that, like using big words, but like what they do to our bodies, uh, on prolonged, uh, you know, when we drink them, when we're around them all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:19:00       Look at your house. All these new products that come out that have huge advertising campaigns, they're probably very safe in on their own. What happens when you mix six of them in the perfect combination? What is that doing to your genetic? What's Wifi to, who knows what the fuck? We're always a, we know that sonar gets in the way of Whales Migrate Migratory Flux Whales Up, right? Yeah. So, so, um, uh, it's, it's always this constant dance of how, you know, in China now what they're doing. I think it's really interesting. There's a lot of the architects when they plan these cities, they're building gardens on the roofs so you can plant food and grow your own food on the roof of your building. You know, China, so self sustainable, there's a billion people there. They don't, they don't import food. They make their own food, which is, which is again, very, which is a very recent development for China.

Speaker 4:          01:19:47       It's pretty amazing. Yeah. Do that with a billion people. But when you do that, you've got to eat bugs. Well, we're getting better, but we're getting better and better at figuring out ways to grow plants, for example, that don't need pesticides that are, that are much higher in protein and different nutrients. Sure. But then you're getting weird because things are genetically monitored than Monsanto owns the dark side. You know, Monsanto, scariest. Fuck, what's that? It's a thing when you say it's fine if you want to cross pollinate to wheat, uh, the strains. But when you take the, the gene from a jellyfish, put it in a strawberry so that my strawberry doesn't freeze when I'm shipping it across the country. That's a little weird man. When you're, when you're, you know, when all of a sudden my oranges are square cause it's easier to pack them.

Speaker 4:          01:20:28       Well have you seen all the wikileaks documents leading to a genetically modified foods? So they're trying to push it all across the world are trying to push into the and the countries and there they're putting imposing sanctions on countries that they do. Also what you can, you can, if you plant one field over here, it's genetically modified and cross pollinates flies in there. Yeah. And then they sue the, those people and those people have to either close up their farm or, well it becomes a fucking disaster I think. I think, you know, I'm a capitalist and all that, but I think that we are paying, we have to be very careful with how everything is becoming these conglomerates and how things are becoming so corporate. Look at radio. Every time I travel this country, you and I both traveled the country. Everything is so homogenous.

Speaker 4:          01:21:05       We've, we've, we've, we've paid a price. You people want efficiency. But why in the world when I go to most cities, can I only eat at a, at a corporate chain? Is there a rabbi I'm surrounded by? I was going to say clear channel. I'm surrounded by, by, by, um, by beige walls. Whether it's Kmart, there's no continuum. There's no like, history. Nobody feels connected to anything. Everything around me is, everybody's trying to sell me something I don't need. And, and it's, it robs every city of its character. It's like the death of the American city. What happened at main street with the mom and pop shops. I want that boiler, but it's, but, but these cities used to all have it and I understand that progress. Small places to get that. I was dealing with large volume of people, small places like that become impact.

Speaker 4:          01:21:49       It's an offshoot of globalism and it was priced. We had to pay, we'll probably swing back, but we pay a price. When you think you can see in speed, what do you think about all these people that believe that you know and if you read almost every ancient religion has some story of a great apocalypse or a great catastrophe and almost every religion has some story about a previous existing society that was advanced and that was almost wiped off the face of the earth. You know when you hear shit about all these animals dying and fish dying, this sounds like religious scripture. How fucking crazy would it be if we all really have been all through this before, if human beings have literally gotten to the point of where we are now, like this sophisticated, if we died off today, how much of this shit would be around in 10,000 years or so, how much would we be able to find and recognize anything that that isn't steel? I think that is great. I think it's a great direction. I do think that that was the answer may lie in somewhere in the area. If I were to answer that question and what I don't know, but, but I think that there is, there is a, um, human beings are the, are still faced with the same problems as human beings. So whether or not I was living 3000 years ago, the, the big questions that one has to rest with

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       that answer the question of what am I doing here? Who am I really? What am I supposed to do? What does this all mean? Those are questions you can never run from. And so within that context, I think we'd be still, we'd still be trying to answer those questions. We'd still be trying to go beyond our biology shore. So be trying to get more pleasure than pain would still be out trying to figure out how to keep our children alive with better food. So I think end, but we'd be competing with resources and we'd still have wars. So I think in a way it makes sense that we'd keep repeating ourselves. This is the human experience. What I'm saying is, do you think that it's ever gotten to this point before? When you look at some of the structures that exist that are unexplained there many, many thousands of years old, especially with the pyramids go.

Speaker 5:          01:23:47       I mean unexplained in the fact that they're not exactly sure how they put that all together. There's a lot of theories and there's also old dynasty in new dynasty and there's old kingdom, a new kingdom. There's a lot of structures that they believe are far, far older than the traditional. We thought it like the, the pyramid of Giza, the Great Pyramid of any, well, I think, I think what separates human beings from animals as far as I know, is that we have imagination and that we seem to be always moving toward the limits of our imagination. But what freaks me out is there's a bunch of shit that they can't figure out how it all got done. And one of them is dogs. Do you know dogs are a great mystery. You know, when you, when you look into the DNA of dogs, it turns out that all of them descend from wolves.

Speaker 5:          01:24:31       They thought it was going to be a bunch of different wild canids and different, they're all from all from fucking actually domesticated wolf. So, and they, we don't know how the fuck that was done thousands and thousands of years ago. We do know that people have always bread their animals, whether they're horses or whatever. Sure. Even farm animals to eat. They've read them so long ago to be, goes back so far that it literally predate society. And that's why it's squirrely. Cause you're talking about 10,000, 15,000 maybe even deeper and deeper into the history of breeding dogs. Yeah. And I think at the answer maybe also is the fact that they're, this, this world is way more, uh, what much older than ours. We are probably much older. Human beings are probably much, history is one thing, but real human history is another. And, and you also want to evolution.

Speaker 5:          01:25:13       I always think about that. It's what's interesting to me is like, is it, if indeed, you know, there's a lot of sense. I said, well we, we've all from apes, chimps or whatever it might be. Um, it, it, it's, you know, people say, well, we're, we kind of seem to stop the evolving physically then if that's the case, didn't we? No. We moved in a different direction. Look, the doubling of the human brain sizes, the giant, the biggest mystery and entire fossil record. And that's what changed us from this, this, this, you know, beetle eating fucking freak monkey to human beings and whatever the fuck caused it. I wonder why he believes it was mushrooms. You know, some people believe it was the throwing arm. Some people believe it was fish that we started eating food. But that doesn't make sense to me because bears are stupid. It's fuck, and they eat a lot. But it goes beyond that. I'm saying why, you know, chimps have always been chimps. Human beings have continued to evolve, uh, just, uh, at least an hour. Well, you know, we'll see in that in we are, we do really

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       amazing things. Know I joke around about people being from monkeys and chimps, but the real lineage is there's a bunch of different primates that evolved next to each other. For some reason we evolved in a far more sophisticated way than all the rest of them. And in the sense that we're always trying to go beyond that, which we can measure and we're always contemplating what that would be. How do you, how would you ever measure, for example, the fact that a great go out an old Mozart or Bach Sonata make some people feel profoundly sad and overjoyed the same time? Why do we even have that stuff? Yeah, it sounds good to our ears, but think about the genius of Great Jazz like Louis Armstrong, Chaz. Like why in the world would that guy, well, I'm just saying, I'm just saying I'm using it. I'm using it as an art form.

Speaker 4:          01:26:46       Like why in the world would we come up with these brass horns and playing all those things that are sort of what we stay alive for. It's interesting. It's like what are we supposed to be doing with that? What are we supposed to be doing with the fact that most religions, all religions talk about well, love each other. That's the most important thing. Love each other. And then, and then by the way, what do you do with that relationship? What are you trying to make the world better? What do you do when you come together? Uh, as, as social animals. Why and and what, what is, what is the point of that? That's the big question that we're always dealing with it. I think it seems, if there's no point, it seems that the point is to enjoy it and to be nice to people.

Speaker 4:          01:27:21       That seems to be the point. The idea, if you're temporary, you're a temporary being and all your descendants are temporary beings. We just keep evolving in a tide of everchanging temporary beings. Then the only point is just be nice, but then why? But then we'd just be then I guess be nice. How Fun. Write it out. Let's see what's next. Is there a creative group of people that were affected by, you know, thousands of what do you think? There's anything to be said though? The going beyond that in the sense that are we supposed to evolve and continue to understand more and more until we, until her [inaudible] so short. It's like, it's the same thing when we talked about before the human experience. What I'm saying is we keep jumping on each other's shoulders. Right? Yeah. So, so, so, you know, even Newton said that, he said, I've, I've stood on the ice to it on the shoulder of giants.

Speaker 4:          01:28:01       You guys all talk about me being, I invented calculus, not bad Isaac who said, by the way, as big as accomplishment, it was lifelong celibacy. Not, not, not calculus. He was like my biggest compliment. It wasn't that I invented the concept of gravity and spatial relationships. It's a, that I was celibate my whole life. That's what cool. Yeah. I was like, really? You have one chick sucked his dick would have ruined everything, but did didn't have to be the father of modern physics, modern science. But, but he said, but, but that's what I'm saying is that we've all, we all stand on each other's shoulders. It seems that we are evolving in our understanding of more and more of how even animals think. And of course, you know, we're certainly evolving everything point to this evolution. I hope I always have said that. I think that we're probably becoming something through technology and the human beings are probably just like a caterpillar that becomes a butterfly but just doesn't know what it's doing. While it's doing it. All our natural instincts towards materialism and greed and selfishness and and you know, all these monkey instincts that we have leftover perhaps working in a natural order to move us towards this ultimate goal, like

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       some sort of technological we're making for example. I mean that's where Kurt's well believes. He believes that, you know, it's going to be some sort of an artificial technology and artificial intelligence that we can download our consciousness into and that you will exist forever in perpetrate in this, you know, artificial environment. How does, yeah, there you go. That's a class. Does that mean it means the matrix? I mean you're talking craziness. Not only now you're talking about if you can duplicate your consciousness, you could duplicate it in an infinite amount of times and it will exist. Not here in this physical space, but it will exist in some sort of cyber world where you will constantly be in like a a replaying life now that in an infinite number of, and not only that we will ultimately end, truly be connected and our experience will be, we are, but we are now.

Speaker 5:          01:29:44       It's just, it's in a weird way and I think the reason why it's set up in a weird way as to encourage competition, you know, the thing that bugs people the most, the things that is losing, you know, the thing, losing anything, losing a person, losing, you know, losing your job, losing, losing, losing a fight, losing in a game. It's frustrating for us. We're designed for competition. Some people so much so that you beat them at pool and they get mad at you. You never ever been around that guy. Beat him at pool. But, but see, I like to ask the next question though. Like losing the defining that really actually I think in some ways not isn't just losing your power in a way. Losing his to be left alone in a way to be sure you're not special and another form of what we believe you.

Speaker 5:          01:30:24       And so I think that's ultimately why people hate losing so much. It's that memory of feeling alone. It's that. But there's also a strong desire for competition among, amongst most people. How many comics do you know that when they see someone else get something, something big, they actually get upset that it's not happening to them. I do. You're the only successful comic I've ever heard comics not talk bad about you. I think that's ridiculous. People have talked bad about me. Lots of people are not really not comics. Go talk to mark Marin. Nah, you don't hear comics say bad things about you. I've never, and I know what the point I'm making is that you're right. I mean, for the most part I'm, I'm, I'm saying that you're right. People when, when somebody actually does well, if it's a comic they get, they get a lot of times.

Speaker 5:          01:31:05       Yeah, a lot of times different deserve sometimes. Especially when you're young and scrappy and you're all coming up in the same order. You know, like you're all like 22, 23 and one of these 22 year old guys gets, uh, some radio show where he's the morning Dj guy and like, all fuck, you know, he's the morning Dj guy had Katie la now or whatever. You know what I mean? Like, and then all of a sudden you like, dudes feel like that could have been them. Sure. You know? And then what they have to understand also, by the way, is that this is not a linear process. This, this world is made of a whole bunch of nonlinear luck and mathematics. And all you say is that because you're a very experienced guy and you've gone through so many things in so many different projects and so, I mean you've, you've, you've gone through the Tour de force of, of television.

Speaker 5:          01:31:46       He did a sketch show and mad TV. You've done family shows on, on, on those Warner brothers networks, right? You've done fucking for everything you did sex in the city. You know, you've done so many different things. You've really had a broad like view of the whole entertainment scene done. A lot of people just don't get, they don't get that. So when you're young, especially like all you know is, I want to fucking make it. I got to make it. I gotta pay my bills. I got to your fucking freaking night shit. He got it. Fuck. Why didn't he remember that? By the way? I remember being terrified. I wasn't gonna make it. I remember thinking, that's not an option for me. Like it wasn't an option for us to be working well, all of us, I think anybody who actually became a comic, you had to deal with the fact that, man, if I put my eggs in this basket, this shit my turn turn out terrible.

Speaker 5:          01:32:33       How might just live in rotten eggs in the air. Nothing. It's terrifying. It's completely terrifying. But my point is that like, you know, like in show business like that, the whole idea of like pursuing it and like go and after it is absolutely of course uncertain, but it has to be uncertain. It's uncertain because that's the only way we're like real queer adventure. Creativity comes from something. It blossoms out of that uncertain. If you knew it was going to happen and you had it all plotted out, it'd be boring as fuck. When you got that for you and it's pouring for that and you'd have to do drugs, you'd have to start doing coke. I think that's why people like when they take a Gig for the money, for example, like they go, well, you're going to be $7 million to do a talk show, a game show.

Speaker 5:          01:33:12       They really do pay a price for that. Yes, you, you, you got to keep the uncertainty. Dude. I paid a price for fear factor for sure. I love doing that show and it was a lot of fun and I loved making all that money and I'm happy I did it, but man, there was a lot of days that I didn't want to do that and I thought this is hokey or this is silly or this is like God, this is, it became a job, which is nothing wrong with revolve respectable. We don't make fun of horse. We all, we were all horse in some ways. We all hoard before is what I'm saying. Sure. And but what am I, my whole point about the whole competition thing about, I think that all of that, it's all set up that way on purpose and then like show Biz competition and in the standup comedy competition, even martial arts competition, like these guys, when they started trash talking each other on the Internet, you know how I look at it when I look at like two fighters are about to trash talk each other.

Speaker 5:          01:33:56       I look at it like birds that are squawking at each other. Like one birds is on the fence and then the other bird like fucking flaps its wings. It gets close to it. It's like this natural thing that they're doing, like they have to do this to in order to motivate them to be great, in order to push them all to the next level, you have to feel the jealousy. Madison who said, you know, I always wondered who I leave, was talking, talking to, and he said I'm the greatest. And then I realized one day he was talking to himself. Oh yeah. He said, he said to train, cause you know, I'm, I'm scared to death every time I step in that ring. But I, but I get myself worked up and by the time I'm in there, I believe what I'm saying am I, that's the saddest thing in the world at Muhammad Ali is the way he is now.

Speaker 5:          01:34:31       That's a great note. And that, you know, it's Parkinson's and he has trauma related Parkinson. What's amazing also is that he doesn't hide it from the world. They'd get, the guy holds the torch, the Olympics. He just gets up in front of, everybody hears me. You know, it's weird listening to Mike Tyson talk these days. If you heard Mike Tyson talk, I haven't just got a reality show now. He got an interview with this reality show on, on pigeons. But he got interviewed at this, uh, there was a showtime boxing match recently. No. Yeah. Well the paper view match between Miguel Cotto and um, uh, we're caught in Majorca and it was a good fight. And they interviewed the Tyson Kodo. Did. He stopped him in the last round. Um, and they, they talked to Tyson about it and Tyson like, you know, it was like he was laboring to talk, you know, and I was listening to him.

Speaker 5:          01:35:13       I was like, wow, maybe he's just tired and maybe they caught, yeah, you might have been high as fuck. That's true because catch me, I might look like a braid down. Nice. Mostly if ever met a fight. You know what? I don't have to do commentary. God, I love going to fights when I don't have to do commentary because these guys, when we, whenever we go to the UFC, Brian and Orient Joey, if these guys take pot cookies and get blue grieved. So they're sitting up. Last time was acid. So they're sitting up in the stands. I kind of have in the fucking time. Joey Diaz has does the commentary, right? Joey Diaz, just like in the middle of fights, he'll start just rants and raves about this happened and that happened. So Ben, especially if somebody gets knocked out or somebody gets submitted, I don't, what the fuck did I tell you?

Speaker 5:          01:35:53       A dog, he'll get up and go cry. But I don't get to see that anymore. I do, you know? Do you know what, did you really truly feel comfortable calling a fight in the UFC? When did it really start to Gel? Because it just comes out of you now. Um, you know, the first couple of times I was self conscious about it. You know, it's weird you're trying to do a good job, but you don't want to be, there's a lot of ego involved in commentary that's very unpleasant. Like you hear people talking too much about themselves or what take yourself what they would do. Well, I have to, first of all, I'm completely illegitimate. I mean, I'm a brown belt in Jujitsu and I fought and some taekwondo and some kickboxing, but I've never found any MMA fights at all. So I, I, what am I going to say?

Speaker 5:          01:36:33       Oh, I could do better than this. You know what I mean? It's silly. I'm, I'm completely objective about it. But I, it took a while for me to be comfortable with like how I should, you know, what I should talk about and what I shouldn't talk about and when to talk, when not to talk. And you know, it had a, how to like get, be as respectful as possible but yet be as objective and analytical as possible about what's happening, you know, so you have to walk a fine line between critiquing fighters and criticizing them or a obsessing patterns that you see in movement and critiquing behavior and training regiments and shit like that. So it's, it's, it's tricky. It's tricky, but I always do it from a place of respect and I always do it from a place of as, as objective as I'm capable.

Speaker 5:          01:37:18       You're very good at doing, it's fun to do. I didn't Goldie's is, is a poet that, yeah, it's just amazing what a lot of people don't know. It's like they'll say, Goldie, Phil, you've got to fill here. Got to fill here. They'll say they'd say that to our headsets. So Goldie, we'll start just going off about this fucking arena that we're in. That was built in 18 fucking 12 and he's off the top of his head and band aids and he just does it make perfectly, you know, 1912 he might've stumbled once in the thousand fights that we wrote those lines out and they're just perfect. Sometimes he doesn't say the correct thing when it comes to like the technique or something like that, but that's okay because I can correct him and he just trying

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       to get things going. Like he's just trying to, you know who's you know who he is by the way. I don't know if you've ever seen, you know, it was the best improviser I've ever seen in my life and a guy who can take a topic and do 30 minutes of stand up on it and do whatever is Adam Carolla. Oh yeah. Evil rambled pro. That's why he's so good as a Pocho a podcast host, that guy, you give them a subject, here's the thing. Okay. All for you having your coffee and he'll just like have some goes off 20 minute rant about what's wrong with like, you know, he did something about twist ties about twist ties. Like, well, what was it like twist ties. Like how strong are these things? And they should be you. Like, she'd cover up those soldiers in Iraq with twist ties.

Speaker 4:          01:38:36       I mean, he just, he's amazing. It's coming up with just like free form and like entire jokes I said, and we got off. I go, I got, we did a movie together and I go and we were on set and I go, you know what? I said, I've decided you're, you're, you might be the best in the world at what you do. And he goes, what do you mean? I said, I think you're the best improviser and a good, best guy I've ever seen at Improv. The way you do your Improv. I'm never, I think you're the best in the world. He goes, oh, I don't know. I go, somebody has got to be the best. So, um, you're, you're getting the trophy I'm good at. So he goes like this. He goes, so apparently this is the podcast, next thing, cause you know, you know, I know I like that guy, Brian cow guy.

Speaker 4:          01:39:15       And he told me I might be the best improviser in the world and I thought, you know why not? So I got home and I looked at my wife and I was like, hey, how come? No, I don't smell any pot. Roast wise, my dick in your mouth for crying saying I'm the best guy in the world and Improv. And he's like, recognize any Brian counts. Said it. So it's true. He's a guy, he's really found success with this whole podcast format. He's also a great guy. He's a great guy. Good guy. He's an interesting dude. He's really into cars, man. He's got the dope. Who's on Raj? Man, is he very good. Did you ever box with him? No, but I've heard guys who fight like guys, he's actually a ringer. You'll get in a ring. And it really, it was a real, I believe it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:48       He's good at everything. He's a great carpenter. He like fucking remodels his house and shit builds additions on his own real American. He has a real Alec Baldwin read far before he went crazy. And, and, and this guy might be my Adam Carolla has the dopest garage mountain. He's got like one of those garages. Yeah. But I'm, mine was built for a TV show. You got to pee pee. But I'm Carolla's garage is like a, he's got like a fucking Ferrari there. A like a classic BMW m three. He's got a Mustang back there. He's got a Lamborghini back there. I think he's kind of like a classic Lamborghini. It was just like really fucking into like machines and cars and shit. What's, what's going on with Kevin Smith? What's this talk on top of? He was, he said he wanted to get together and do a podcast and he said, uh, we should uh, smoke pot. Talk about news radio. I'm like, fuck yeah, I would love to a man. So I messaged him, but when you get, and here's the thing, when people say, how come nobody moves Mitch Book with me, Buck, I'm not on Twitter all day. I tried to go on and post things when I have time. And, but a lot of times I'm fucking busy. And when you have like, I think now I'm up to 283,000

Speaker 1:          01:40:55       bitch, what am I looking? Just because you don't have that many, excuse me. 283,982 so almost 284,000 there's no way I can keep up with the replies. There's the, if you don't look at it for an hour, there's 1700 replies. And so what do you do? Do you do read them all? I can't. I don't have the time. It's impossible. Some of those people listen, bitch got to earn them shit. My Dad says he's not. He doesn't have a podcast. How's that going to get so famous? Going to be cool though. If you could give them like, I'll give you 50,000 people on Twitter. Yeah. And then all of sudden they'd be getting your goofy ass. I hate cats. What's wrong with this guy? This new IPAD by the way? Fucking awesome. I think you'll use it more. Why they using the market as a camera? The camera's shit is so bad ass fucking sitting there doing facetimes and shit like that were 13 year old girl, little girl looking at my face.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       You could, we could transplant your brain into a 13 year old lesbian so easily. It's hot. The camera's bad ass. You are loving it. I'm loving it. It's at the other one was good but then the no camera thing just really made me never want to use it that much. Really? Yeah cause that was a big part at all man. I only use it for watching things like when I was getting tattooed I use it to watch TV shows and I use it to for reading books. Yeah know he's a friend. What? What's that iPad? Yeah. I don't have one. I'm just going to get the air book cause I traveled but do I need an iPad? Yeah, that's an Arabic. You don't need one. This is a little Mac book. Little tiny arrow. It's a light light pussy bro. I get a 17 inch and I carry that shit over my shoulder.

Speaker 1:          01:42:30       I don't even bother putting the backpack on. Dude. I do squats. I do kettle bells on a regular sun step. One time you said to a bus full of fighters? I remember it was like the four back in the UFC. Literally when Randy called to our foot view to our Belfour, it's like back in those days like 20 gunner, we were in Tennessee or baton rouge or something. And I remember walking into the venue, remember that like how, how ghetto it was back in the day like just and Randy, we were actually that anyway, but um, you go, uh, they were talking about training techniques and you were like, I like to get into horse dance and uh, put my boss inside my body and read Nietzsche. I think Emmanuel steward was that like be like, everybody's like all these fighters, no sense here. But they all look through like this.

Speaker 1:          01:43:12       They're like, oh is he saying what he's saying? Cause you weren't really that famous yet. Really? Like I like to get in the horse stance, pushed my balls and my body and read, read Nietzsche. Everyone's like see fucking serious. Cause you were kind of squat and they didn't look, didn't laugh at me at all, but I got into a squat position too. I've gone to that horse dance. I was fucking done. There was no room for humor in those early UFC. Nah Man, that was just, I was, I was also the post fight interview or it wasn't a commentator, so no one got to see my sense of, you know, when we were with tank and, and we're all those guys. And you were just like, be be careful. Don't be a jackass around tank. I don't know what he might tank will implode your skull speech. Well just beat your ass. You know, like, you know Brian don't be it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       Don't be like, Hey, thank hang, hang Handley. I'm going to tweak your nose tank. We'll put you to sleep. He puts me to sleep, go to jail, ignore normal, kill you, kill you. He might definitely changed the way you look at the world or shaking his hand and, and, and it felt, I've never felt the hand that strongest is, he was just a burger. How about thinking about dude's like, we were talking about how bad ass mayhem as you were fucking around with mayhem. And uh, I said, well, I want to watch the, show you a video of who some are Paul Horace submitting. Ma'Am. Just think that someone can do that to a guy as good as Ma'am as good and as strong as mammals. There's just levels, level levels upon levels. I'm a bad balloon. That guy's a silver back. That's how it is.

Speaker 4:          01:44:31       You know, I'm a Saluki engine. The first dude that fucking stumble across gorillas because that did happen by the way, as far as western humans that, you know, as far as white people, that's right. That, that like they were, the gorillas were a myth until like the 18 hundreds, right. In Indonesia, a guy had a woke up, uh, uh, male, uh, orangutan up, woke them up and think fleet flipped out and grabbed him by the hair. It got kind of long hair thicken and he's grabbing my hair and just, yeah, Yang and, and scalped him, they took all his just rip and Scout. I'm like, he freaked out. I pulled this a hair off and, and, and, and then ran off into the trees. Oh my God. So he had no scalp. That's right. So what they do, they have to like skin graft was head are fucked in Indonesia.

Speaker 4:          01:45:17       You know, I would just die of staph infection today. I am surprised like, you know, I think in the crazy thing is gorilla to the biggest, but they don't even eat meat. They're all vegetarian. That's right. It's called genetics. My friend. I knew. Watch them and watch those grills. You can stand right next to him because there's it's plex. Watch them wrestle. All they do when they're little is wrestle. All they do is roll around and they have arm drags. Duck unders. I'm not kidding. Real. It locks guillotines I swear to God they put you in their guard. I swear. So I'm telling you that, that the man who invented you too. It's just hitting and Gracie Helio. Well, sort of. I mean, there was Japanese Raf scores first of course, but he, he, you know, after he could find a helio and Carlos, I would, I wouldn't be surprised if one day they were watching gorillas row, watch them play.

Speaker 4:          01:46:03       It is there. So they're, they're the perfect wrestlers. They're so efficient for wrestling. They're so efficient. It's just so weird that they're so big and that the plants, why? Because a silverback is not six feet tall, maybe six feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Fat Free, ladies and gentlemen, no fed on this giant fucking monstrous arms and hope. What does all that for? Is it all just to keep things from fucking with it? It must be, I don't know, man. It's just, cause they don't kill any, they don't really swing through trees. They're just, and they're not really aggressive. They have little dicks. Yep. And they have little dicks. I have a bigger dick than a 600 pound gorilla. She's a Samson. So, uh, let's think about that though. 600 pounds, that's a, that's a lot of weight. And then, and then there's the polar bear. Yeah. Which would eat a gorilla. Yeah. What the fuck do you

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       think a polar bear could eat a gorilla? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Oh, what do I think so? I don't know. I would have ever done that. They 15 to 16 to 1700 pounds. Is that what a polar bears? Some of the little girls because he got down, but they stand. They stand 10 feet or higher. They're, they're bigger than a basketball. Go to a basketball hoop, try to touch the rim. And they're bigger than that. When they stand in their court on their hind legs. Um, yeah. They take down, they take down things like elk with their mouths. Uh, yeah. You will kill the whales. You ever seen them eat pilot whales through the ice? I have no doubt. The polar bears have big penises. I Dunno, it's a good question, but they'll kick the shit out of aggression. Rock solid. Question, question Brian. Thank you.

Speaker 5:          01:47:25       Hold that question for a second. We'll put that on the wall. Polar bears are scary as fuck. If you're in Alaska, if you see one, you better run. Big Carnival. Biggest biggest land carnivore actively targets human beings, human beings, they will make a beeline for you is a terrifying story that I read once about these guys that were in a boat and the boat hit an iceberg and the boat starts to sink. So they sent out a distress signal and they climbed off the boat onto an ice shelf. You heard a story? Yeah, I know. All of us. There's a few researchers, I forget the number, but there was more than three terrible story and uh, this polar bear saw them and kept diving off one ice sculpture to the next, getting closer and closer sizing them up until finally he was on the one ice sculpture, jumping around.

Speaker 5:          01:48:09       There was screaming the yelling, the polar bear. I didn't give a fuck. He's like, hmm, make yourself hard to swap them to eat some you bridges. And he came over and he was on the ice ice sculpture of the Ice Island right next to them, jumped in the water, got on their side, walked calmly up to the first guy he'd get ahold of. They scrambled. Everybody stumbled over each other trying to get out of the way. Grabs a guy, kills him right there. Instantly grabs his limp body, jumps off the ice, ice island into the water, swims over to the other one, just starts eating. I'm right in front of them. And so he ate that one guy and then help came and help. Came in the next boat came when the, the, you know, this distressed. It was answered by the time they got there. This guy was just rib cage popping out of his fucking his jacket.

Speaker 5:          01:48:51       I don't want to, I'm not really interested in die that way. Thank you. Cause you're not doing anything. That's a bear. Good luck. And a polar bear. Polar bears and fucking ocean. Do they grab you by the neck? And I did. They just shake a couple of times, I guess sometimes. Sometimes they just start eating. You start eating you from the bikes up. Like the guy from grizzly bear, seven minute audio tape time didn't go on and go some eggs. Oh, those are my feet. My feet least that shit doesn't my calves. Yeah. Jesus Christ. My Thei just taking chunks out of your thigh. Ruthless. That youtube video of the woman got too close to the polar bear's cave. Oh yeah. And it breaks her leg. Yep. Brought her in Hana soccer. Yeah. They're mean. They're also fast. Well they have to be there live in fucking the frozen north. What a crazy place to live. They like to clean up agents of the frozen north. You can't put a baby polar bear or even a smaller polar bear, like an adolescent polar bear into a cage with a big bear is what?

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       It'll eat it. Oh yeah. Jack females will keep those there. Their cubs, they'll dealt Dell run away from a male. A male will chase a female in her cubs for two days trying to eat those cubs. She's fucking so I'll follow up. Female running and keeping her cubs going to get away from a male who sees them and says, I want to eat your babies babe. Fuck. Cause she goes, guys, we've got to run. Let's run now. But why is he still chasing us? I'm tired. Mommy. Shut up. This is, that's the school of hard knocks by the way. Yeah. You think and you know Anelli both fucking cubs to, they won't just eat one, let the other one free. No, he's going to kill that one and went out after the next one or the other one is, you know, yeah, they have to store up.

Speaker 1:          01:50:27       They have the store. I'm just not doing a thing. She's got to just go, ah, Randy Kaltura asked me to go hunting with them. I'm going to go hunting with Randy coture arts and we were going to go bear hunting, but I'm like, I want to eat a bear man. I don't want to eat a bare end. Um, it's, I couldn't do it anyway. I would cancel substand updates. We're trying to figure out another day to do it, but I'm like, let's kill something that I can eat. Black bear or grizzly bear has a blackberry. You can, you can eat oily. Mean taste like shit though, right? You say it's really good. It's oil. Really. What does that mean? Oily mean? They say it's a very thick, that's what I call Mike and I could imagine going gay bear meeting with rate ray is gay bear hunting.

Speaker 1:          01:51:02       Thank you. Let's find some barriers. You find matching jacket. You got your hunting gear. You're going to have been like the city. You're like, what are we doing, dude, this guy's dressed like Bob Seger. Let's take them down. Why do you smell? What do you smell like? Colona why are you wearing eyeliner and why am I, why am I second your Dick Randy couture's, the manliest man ever, and she's all in the hunting with bows and running through the woods. Who's doing the Eco Challenge? When he stopped fighting for awhile, you know, which is running through the fucking forest, the Pacific coast. He doesn't need it. He doesn't need a bow and Arrow or anything else. He just does it and he just runs a bad motherfucker, but he's a, he's a big hunter. He loved hunting, so he's going to take me somewhere. We're going to go a, there's a hunting TV show to do it with whenever I'm around.

Speaker 1:          01:51:44       I've been around Randy couture couple times and um, and I, whenever I'm around a guy like that, I always feel a combination of just awe and just, I feel a little bad about myself. Well I always feel like Jesus, you know, I always say when people say, why don't you [inaudible] movement first of all because I don't want to. And two cause I'm old and then in black and brown eco tours, five years older than me, five years. Yeah. It don't be a pussy. Joe has been it never been combat athletes into their late forties before ever. Never. You never saw, he never saw a 48 year old guy. Combination of a lot of things. A lot of it's genetics too cause the guys never injured, which is crazy. You know, you, you think about all of these different types of cancer, the camps, sports science did a thing where he's able to take the video like is vo Max as much higher? Like he's able to assimilate oxygen and it was mussels much better than, than most people. Well makes sense. He's a lifelong athlete and he was always known. Even in the early, early days of competing. I've just breaking guys wills and that's what he did to Vito Belfort as it's imposed his will on Vitorin torn, broken. Well that's fucking veto for a long time. He's relentless. He keeps you. I'll go for the double leg on a single lake then I, you know, then the

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       beat you up against the case to this was this Machita fight in Toronto's could. Very interesting because uh, he, he really firmly believes that Machida is fights on the outside, but you can grab a hold of them and when you grab a hold of them, Randy thinks he's just going to pin it up against the cage and beat the shit out of. Randy couture is fighting, fighting the Cheetah Brown. Meanwhile he's doing like the expendables too. He's doing movies. He's a crazy fuck dude. And he's trying to get hunting trips and Carl's called caliber like, Whoa, dude, I'm such a girl. It's good to be around those guys. It's good to know that there's levels of, of manliness out there. It's good to know. That's why sports petition young man are very important because it teaches you how tough you are not I've talked to knock off you are, but also how the top of you're not and you need to know both and you've got to know what other people are willing to go through.

Speaker 5:          01:53:32       The kind of pain that some people willing to go through. You got to watch a strength thing, a real live strength and conditioning program. You tell him you want to be an MMA fighter. Okay, go to the gym with Sean Sherk. Just watch him do that one starts. If I watch him fucking, I don't need to, cause I was 17 and I went to Dan Gables and tense of wrestling camp with the Hawkeyes and I, and I remember limping for two weeks. I limped wake you up at five in the morning and you run sprints for an hour and then you do live wrestling. And I, that's what, that's why I didn't want to wrestle in college cause I went, if this is college athletics, I don't want to do it. And what happened was I'd smell a mat and I'd get my back would start to hurt.

Speaker 5:          01:54:04       I got a psychosomatic injury. All right. I bought, it was like, don't do that. I limped I the only time in my life I kept looking at my plane ticket and I was going to fake an injury so I could go home. High school wrestling and making a fucking man out of you. I'll tell you though is that can't down [inaudible] because you had to graduate and like a third of the camp of dropout and his intense and and literally they closed down I believe the next year or the year after that. Well, they also were really encouraging people to lose a tremendous amount of weight, which was terrifying and really fucking terrible. You're young body, you know when you're 1415 years old, you're in high school and your coaching, you're already lean and they're telling you to lose 10 pounds of water and dehydration. You had to wrestle that day too.

Speaker 5:          01:54:42       It's not like the UFC. I did it too. It was awesome. I did it for talking about no tournaments too. It's terrible. My friend did it his whole high school career and he, he's like really short where everyone else's family is tall. He's five, six and everyone else in his family sucks. Six foot, six foot two starving herself. He starved himself all through high school through, through every fucking season cause worse man. And he went to, in the off season he went to camps and like he was like really trying to make it as a wrestler. Boxers don't lose as much weight. I do that cause they got to go 12 rounds. You also have to take head blows. It's much more dangerous when you take the highest blows. Yeah. That's when people get really real serious brain damage. Like Gerald McClellan is a perfect example of that.

Speaker 5:          01:55:18       He's a guy used to be, you lose a lot of weight to make his division. I think he was light heavyweight. He used to, he was, was a big guy and he would dehydrate himself really bad and he didn't go about it the right way. And I don't know if they used Ivs back in those days to rehydrate and now they're pretty sophisticated about it. They always give guys bags of Ivy, like some guys will take six seven eight bags. Oh really? Yeah. They have to rehydrate and they pissed like crazy and, but they feel much better, much quicker as you gain a tremendous amount of weight and like 24 hour period. Like there's a guy glaze and t bow fights in the UFC. I don't know how he loses the weight. I don't know what he does, but this mother fucker fights at one 55 and he looks like he's like one 90 he's fucking, you watch like a, it's like, uh, what's the guy's name?

Speaker 5:          01:55:57       Um, uh, Anthony Johnson. He walks, he's she 50. I did wonder. He was, he was fine with one 70 again when I was, I was doing a movie with them in Pittsburgh and he walked around with these shoulders. I was like, this dude. And he's too, I said, how much do you weigh? It goes to 50 and I go, how are we going to get out of the one 70? He's like, I'll make no problem. He's got it down to a science. I was like, I don't know how the fuck, he's enormous bones. He's a super athlete. That guy is, that's powerful. Standing around you feel like just such a wimp. And he's an interesting guy too because he's a wrestler, but he's really been working primarily on his striking, you know, and he's knocking a lot of guys out. That was a big victory for cost check and crosscheck beat him.

Speaker 5:          01:56:37       I think a lot of that guy's problem is that he, he has, uh, he gets really depleted making that one 70. I think he'd be better served and one 85 I think a lot of guys would call. I think a lot of guys lose too much weight and I think over the long course of a career, it's very dangerous. Can I ask you that? Healthy, I don't know if you're allowed to say, but is there going to be a GSP Anderson Silva fight? They want to do that, but what GSP has to get through Jake shields, which has no fucking cakewalk. Jake shields is dangerous as fuck and he's a winner and his Jujitsu is top notch. Jake, Jake shields can submit anybody. Sure, but did GSP has proved that he is still far and away these a bad motherfucker. No doubt about it. But you can't discount Jake shields who GSPs never fought Jake shields.

Speaker 5:          01:57:16       I'm telling you, Jen shields, look, he might be at GSP, might be able to keep the fun in his feet and if he does, GSP is more than likely gonna be far better on his feet. He's got way better striking. We put her hands were better kicks and Jake, Jake is just all about closing the distance, getting a hold of you and drag you to the ground. And if he can't do that, yeah, he's in some trouble. He's going to get boxed up. But if he can do that, it becomes very interesting. It becomes very interesting because Jake shields has competed at the very highest levels of the game in grappling and submitted guys. In fact, in Abu Dhabi that submitted GSP, his level of Jujitsu is quite a bit higher. But, but George is so smart and he so defensively intelligent and he's never been submitted in them and they had before.

Speaker 5:          01:57:58       So at least not as also sells a punching in the face. Yeah and elbow and you any strong as fuck. Fucking his wrestling is outstanding to yeah, they say, I've talked to guys who trained with them and they say that he's just, he's really, really strong, got super humble, he's got great strength and he's also like really smart and he does things correctly and he's like super driven. Like I told you, we worked on that turning side kick thing. He talked to me afterwards like Joe at practice did that thousand time I was on this set. They were like, this guy's crazy and kicking the bag. I'm telling you man, I'm going to get it. Like he was like obsessed with it. Like ever. You show him a technique, he'll, he'll go over and go over and next thing you do it, he'll probably be doing it better than you who taught him.

Speaker 5:          01:58:36       You know it's funny about that. It's like that you see these people who are great and they do these things and you think it's magic. They just work than repetitions, obsession and repetition. And you know, the same desire that gets you far in life with that can also fuck you up if you get addicted to everquest. You know, it's the same sort of obsession. Could, can wind you up in a ditch if it becomes something that's not productive for me. I have done, I know you're probably the same way. I have to manage my addictions. I have to like, be real careful to keep an eye on. Is that intense as you are that way? You've always been really, really obsessive. Well, it's a problem. It's like, it's, it's, it's not even a discipline. It's more of a obsession. I'm disciplined, Kinda, I mean, I get things done, I'm disciplined, but I really am as driven.

Speaker 5:          01:59:17       There's a big difference if I find something out, like I'm not good at doing things I don't want to do, you know, like I'm not good at taking out the garbage. I'm not good at remembering to do errands things and I'm supposed to do, I'm not good at. But if there's something I'm excited about it. There's something that's uh, that's uh, motivated about. Then I become obsessed with it and then I'll become driven to, to get good at whatever the fuck this thing is. So it's not even like a discipline thing. It's almost like fun. I just know how to turn on the crazy switch. Yeah, you're really, really good at that, but you got to manage that shit man. There's a lot of people that don't and they get into gambling and then they become fucking crazy with blackjack or poker or

Speaker 4:          01:59:50       I've always been really grateful that I didn't have the kind of wiring that was predisposed to the kind of negative obsessions like that. Well, you're self deprecating enough to the point where you don't have to constantly be the best guy in the room. You know, you don't, you can have a good time no matter what. Some guys enjoyed my friends' successes. I've always thought, I've always found it more inspiring than threatening. I never, I just think it's like intelligence. It's like trying to compartmentalize anything, you know? Well that's why you're a healthy do to, that's where you got funded. But it's like when I bought it, but it's like courage. You know? Some people say, well, I'm a coward. Well you're a coward. Maybe you wouldn't get up on stage and do stand up, but you'd fight six guys in a bar and intelligence or talent.

Speaker 4:          02:00:27       It's all the same stuff. You're good at. You know? Some people you just have to find what you're good at. This shit. What's your role? It might be to support talented people. It might be to be the one on stage. It might be the one who comes up with a microphone that you, that you use it. There's club, ours, there's an managers, there's agents, there's comics. If you have children or stick. Your job is to try to nudge that child in the direction of what he's supposed to do anyway, whatever his primal impulses are, you know, and you contemplate, I mean you, you have kids now. Are you actively thinking about that? Are Your, your daughters? My daughter and when I tried to do with my daughter is provide two things. One is love, unconditional love, so she's not messed up. But I also believe that a large part of my job is to stand out of the way, not to be a suppressive, overwhelming personality for her.

Speaker 4:          02:01:10       I don't want to be too much of an influence. And the reason I don't want is I want her to ultimately, I think a great deal comes from having to be independent and also feeling free enough and not ashamed of whatever it is you are. And so much of my childhood and is now nobody's fault. But so much of my childhood is when I think back on it, even my young adult eight years is fill full of kind of. But what I would describe as shame, I mean certainly as confusion, but also shame, just also this God, I feel so different than most people. I'm a fuck up and I've got to get my shit together. Well, no, I didn't. I actually had to just go deeper into that. And so you know, to be a performer, yes. But if you are a car salesman, yeah, you would have had a problem.

Speaker 4:          02:01:55       Sure. But, but I'm saying, yeah. You know what I mean? It's like we were, we're lucky that this avenue exists. Absolutely. I'm just saying you've got to find whatever you're having new ones. And I think that, you know, people say, well everybody has a path. I don't know about that. But your job as a young adult as a child is to tiny. Everybody could have a path. It's not that everybody does that. Everybody. Could you also, you said something really profound, I've been thinking about a lot lately. I thought it was really cool. You said it's one thing to be really accomplished and you've accomplished things. You be can go through all this stuff but, but the one thing you said that you're the most proud of is accomplishing your peace of mind. And that is a very separate, separate endeavor from, from trying to make money and trying to make a name for yourself.

Speaker 4:          02:02:34       Trying to be significant, trying to be original, but that, but actually getting to a point where you have peace of mind I think is equally as important as any more important than anything it is. Um, I'm happier now than I've ever been at any point in my life. And I'm also nicer to people now than at any point ever in my own life. And more conscious about like biological maintenance, making sure our workout on a regular basis, making sure I'm healthy, all those things together with my luck, figure it out anyway. Changed in some ways your personality in a way. I mean you, you've changed, you've, you've actually made fundamental changes in how you relate to other human beings. I've seen that in you. A lot of that is psychedelics and uh, and the tank Lieutenant Authority. It's a combination of the tank recently. Yeah, it was awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:03:22       Tell me about this. I end with this because we've been talking for a long time, but tell me, tell me what your experience was like. I uh, I got into the, to the salt water and it was really dark and I just found people don't know this is a sensory deprivation tank. We're talking about it. Yeah. And I thought two things. I thought I was going to go restless and I thought the other thing I was going to get cold and then I thought I was going to sink and art and in fact, um, I started to just focus on my breath and sort of, it was very easy for me to kind of disappear for real. And um, I think I stayed in there for two hours, but I could have stayed in there way longer, way longer. People say, you know, you know, you, he said, I think the guy said, you know, 15 minutes in or you know, or you might be in there for an hour, but it might be hard for me.

Speaker 4:          02:04:10       I could've, I could've just stayed in there. It's amazing environment, isn't it? You need to get one of those. I think we all need that. When you live in the area, she can go, yeah, and you can go to that place all the time. But man, having one of your houses, this shit, how often you change that water, you don't have to, you don't have to. It's only me that goes in it and there's 800 pounds of salt and nothing can live in there. That's amazing. Yeah. It's like it's, it's so dense. Yeah, it is is just like that. It's the most valuable program ever or the valuable tool ever for

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       reprogramming your mind, for looking at yourself and then in a truly objective way and to be tethered, untethered rather from your life, untethered from your, your personal experiences and able to look at them. Literally when you're inside that tank, it feels like you're not there. It feels like you time has essentially stopped. You're not getting any input. It might be going on without you all rambling free in the world, but in your life, your, your life is all about how you relate to everything that you see in your environment, so having a chance to be out of your environment, the only opportunity that you have in the world, that's the only environment on the planet like that. When you can go and separate yourself literally from your life and watch yourself if you don't know what we're talking about. We're talking about a sensory deprivation tank, which was created by a psychedelic pioneer from the fifties named John Lilly, who's this brilliant scientist who was incredibly eccentric.

Speaker 5:          02:05:28       And one of the things he wanted to figure out was how to detach himself from his physical inputs, inputs of sound and feeling and seeing things and how to figure out how to get the mind literally away from any input to the body. He realized that life is very distracting and that you know conversations that you're having. If there's a bus driving by right next to you, it's hard to have that conversation. The buses distracting things, input is distracting and when you were in the tank, you are literally dealing with no input. You have no hearing because your ears are under water and it's a big heavy door that's shut and it's pretty soundproof. You have no seen cause you're in total blackness. You total complete darkness, you know, feel anything because the water's the same temperature as your skin and the water has 800 pounds of salt in it.

Speaker 5:          02:06:10       So you completely buoyant and it's the most amazing environment, man. It goes into that. Really that was that, that I think therefore I am right. Um, they carts so, but, but that's always been disputed in the sense that because you can imagine it doesn't mean indeed that it's e that it's actually there. Well then the question is what is the imagination? This is the real question is what is the imagination and our thoughts really nonlocal when all you really, are you really just a biological antenna that like picks up entropy in the air that picks up creativity and ideas and things. And these are, these are literally like woven into the fabric of time all around us. You know what that great mathematician and won the fields medal said, right? And he refuses to fields metal, which is $1 million prize, I believe in. It's like the Nobel prize for mathematics.

Speaker 5:          02:06:57       They couldn't find them Fadiman Siberia year later. And he goes, why are you giving me the price that you should be given the equation for us? I just, I just have antenna. I'm wired a certain way and I was able to channel the answer. I think it was a 350 page answer they've been looking at. They, they, even the, even the problem had been conjectured in like 1806 and they were trying to, the actual problem. Then he came up with the answer and all these mathematician, like this guy actually figured it out after 300 years and he's just incredible really? And he goes, yeah, yeah, but what, what are you, you're giving the prize to the, to the radio. You should be giving it to the music. They all say that. Every artist says that. Every great writer says that they tune into the, you know, it's, it's a tough, it makes me believe in any kind of God or whatever you want to call it.

Speaker 5:          02:07:40       A, you know, a higher benevolent force of some kind or at least something of beauty. I don't know. What was my point that that, that, that we, we, what is imagination? Well, thank you. This is my point was the idea of imagination is very strange because you have this idea, you have this, this thing that comes in your mind. Wait a minute, if I do this and combine it with that, Holy Shit. I just reinvent. I just made a new invention is going to be quick. This is going to revolutionize what you've done is with this thing in the ether. You have pulled it out of that and now it manifests itself in a physical form and alters human life. It's good. It changes life. Like all the things that people have invented, they had to initially think up whether it's the car, whether it's computers or this had to be a thought in someone's mind, a creative idea or a conglomeration of other ideas that have existed before.

Speaker 5:          02:08:30       That's a common story thing and they combine it and make some new creative thing, but whatever the imagination is, it eventually manifests itself as an actual thing. So we don't look at that for some of those other ones. Frivolous imagination is also way more important than what you consider intelligence are amassing information. Imagination is what moves history forward. It Gutenberg, Innovation, Gutenberg, when he came up with a printing press, uh, even Freud when he came up with a concept that you could figure out how the human mind works. Einstein's theory of relativity, Newton's a, you know, calculus, these guys who were these seminal thinkers who came up with, with even Karl Marx for that matter, I'm not a communist, but these guys who came up with these sort of seminal concepts of, you know, how to restructure our society, how to restructure our biology, how to restructure our minds, how to look at our minds, all those things from the man's imagination and it and it and it, and we leaped forward in some ways.

Speaker 5:          02:09:23       Not In a good way. In some ways. We came up with the atomic bomb. Well, yeah, I mean, but the atom, but it's all the same thing, right? It's all people and you know, whatever branch of study that they choose to pursue, you know, they, they, they, they create things. That's right. You know and it becomes an actual physical thing, but what is the imagination that's making that happen? Is it like a life form and was the point? Yeah, and also what's the point that the diagram, the the map of the universe and we're supposed to follow, he brought this podcast full circle because we started with that question and we end with that question. Who knows? Have imagination kids. This is, this is our message folks. Just be fucking nice to people. If we all were cool, if everybody was like the people in this room right now, if the whole world was made up of us and we just ran into us everywhere, I mean I'm not, that's so egocentric and ridiculous to say, but the mindset of what I'm talking about, just be cool to people.

Speaker 5:          02:10:12       Just be nice. You know what the problem is? Sometimes competition is the problem. Not only that, sometimes she always has an idea that they think is better for you. So example, the board, the boat was that certain people in Kansas say, let's start teaching intelligent design and not evolution and we're going to teach your child that because it's better for his soul and all of a sudden you go, wait a minute, you're trying to be nice to me, but I don't want that kind of Nice. Yeah, that's the wrong kind of Nice. That's not what I'm talking about. Talking about people not fucking with other people. Don't watch all of the people worry about yourself. There's just so many of us. There's so many of us. It's hard to get this all across, but I firmly believe that we right now are more advanced, more in tune, more tuned in than any other generation has ever been before and a lot of is because of stuff like this.

Speaker 5:          02:10:52       A lot of it is because of the podcast, Internet things. You can read the, the access to information, all these things. We were communicating in a way with Twitter and with Facebook and that no one's ever done before. I think we're connected the way we've never been before in real time. Yeah. This, these things that we are, we're all pushing together. It's a, it's a fascinating time and I think human beings culturally are evolving at a, at a, an incredible race at an incredible pace rather exponential technology certainly to say. Yeah, that's still the nuttiest thing about all this 2012 nonsense. It says fuck everything's pointing towards that being real. Everything's pointing towards all these fucking events happening in people changing and technology accelerated an incredible pace. When we talked about earlier about the center of every galaxy being a black hole that we were talking about that, well that's what they're trying to do with the large hadron collider there making black holes.

Speaker 5:          02:11:39       So the center of every galaxy is a black hole and inside that black hole is a universe and then they're making universes like what does the breaks out Matt, we are butterflies and we are on our way to being the next thing you know there was a caterpillar that became a butterfly and that is the human. Did you want to, if you want an actually great lecture on that, it's called Homo ever lewdness and it's by one Enrique is it could have ted.com and won and rake us. We'll take you through a lecture called Homo have alluded to and he talks about how we're coming out with, for example, eyes well that that right now can see shadow and light, but they're going to pretty much pursuing to be able to see underwater and in the dark for a mile away and eventually or is that can see a mile away. All that stuff and we're going to become, we're going to start to become machine part machine as we come up with bio compatible components, wave facet and we're going to ever evolve into the whatever else we're supposed to buy a lot. I know people already that have artificial hips. I know a couple of people and dude, my hip starts clicking now your hips are fucked up. My hip on this side really hurts sometimes when I move the wrong. Try being a top every now and then,

Speaker 6:          02:12:36       hey

Speaker 5:          02:12:40       gang gave you the greatest. Thank you very much for being on the podcast. Again, always the most fascinating, intriguing in depth conversations. Head spinning shit. I don't want to have to go back and review it because there was a lot of stuff that we talked about that I'm like, wow, I really need to consider this. And I apologize for any a and accuracies.
