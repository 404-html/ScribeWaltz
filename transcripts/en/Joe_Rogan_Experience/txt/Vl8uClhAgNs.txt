Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Every day life. Four, three, two, one five. And we're here with the Arnold Schwarzenegger of competence. Mary Lynn Rice Cup. When, how many people have ever on one shot spelled your name right or pronounced it right. Hey, never, never, never. Right. Like if you're at the DMV now that you mentioned it because they're going to introduce me and it's just, uh, it just gives like an instant obstacle. Like when you were coming up as a comic, that had to be a big issue for the MC to bring you up or the, the, the Dj when they bring you up as you were the MC or the DJ or the MC. I don't know. I never really looked at it that way. Well, somebody had an inner introduce you. Yeah. Right. Like I think I was in such a, uh, a bubble. I didn't really, and I wasn't on the road hardcore and I wasn't, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       I wasn't identifying with me as a performer so much. What does that mean? That means I was doing performance art and people were laughing. I didn't know why they were laughing. Right. I moved to La. I was like, yeah, let's do shows. Like I didn't know, I didn't think about it as like you're introducing me. I'm a, I'm a performer. I would say only in the past couple of years if I'd done the road proper. But I came in the back alley for everything, for comedy, for, for acting. Like if I had come to la with a stack of head shots, like, Hey, I'm ready for acting. It would've never happened. I just came with a group of people like, Oh to do some live shows and like no business being in La, no business, just doing weird shows cause that that's what I was compelled to do. Like I could not have done it had I said, all right, you're going to do acting and performing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Especially not comedy. Like I didn't identify with that at all. I had to figure out why people were laughing. That's fascinating. So when you first got into show business, what was the goal? It's a weird bird show business, isn't she? Isn't she a special lady? I'm, I'm audition ready today by the way. You notice I have a good brow in a good eye shadow line. I'm such a woman. I'm really more of a woman now than I've ever been. What's sad about what's that about? Just growing up, letting it go, letting it go. And I look back in my twenties and I'm like, you were up hot bitch. Like what was wrong with you? But I was so incapable of anything like so socially. I mean I still am, but I'm much, much better now. But it's awkward, awkward and just, but that's um, I don't find you awkward. So it's odd. Like every time I've talked to you, we've had very fun, comfortable conversations. I never found it to be awkward. I don't find you to be awkward either. Maybe we just don't make each other awkward.

Speaker 2:          00:03:02       Is that weird? My mind just went to an instagram APP. Ah, that was creep tastic in my own mind. That one that goes in close and it does the little stars. Sorry. It's all right. Honestly, don't find you to be awkward. Every time I've ever talked to you, it's been very, very comfortable. Very easy. I agree. But I would also say that's kind of a recent development that you and I are speaking was when I started coming back to the comedy store, which was what, a couple of years ago? Yeah, three now I guess. Three something. 14 November of 14 I think it was because we've been in each other's orbit since, you know, since news radio. Yeah. But we didn't really get a chance to like, yeah, hang out or be friends til the store. You know? That's such an interesting little community. Right. It's like everybody just kinda like, like what I'm talking about a positive community.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       Like I was just explaining, explaining this to someone the other day. Like when I first started going there in 1994 there was a lot of conflict between comedians. There's like comedians. It didn't like comedians. Like, Oh, this guy doesn't like this guy and she doesn't like her and they all fucking, yeah. Duked it out with each other a little bit. There's none of that now. Yeah. It think about it's amazing quarter of that places. It's amazing. Like everybody's friendly. Yeah. I love it. Like, there might be a hundred of us there on a regular basis, like in and out doing Sunday through Monday. Yeah. And there's no conflicts. It's really fucking cool. Um, did you, I'm sure you've talked about this a million times. Did you eat, did you ever stop going there for a chunk of time where you stopped for seven years? Yeah, I stopped for seven years after I had that dispute with Carlos Rensea.

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       Yeah. That was when he was way more popular than me, like, especially as a comic and the comedy store took his side and I was like, all right, fuck you guys. And I, I took off. It wasn't really the comedy store either. It was this one guy who was the manager, cause Mitzi, actually I called Mitzi and gave her the whole rundown of what was going on. Um, I told her and she's like, well I'm ain't gonna just stay away in front of mom. And then she gave me a spot that night and then they called me up two hours later telling me that I was banned. So I said, wait a minute, I just talk to Mitzi. Like she gave me a spot. She told me when to go up. So if, if she's not running the store, like who's who's deciding on band? You are like, what are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       Like do you guys understand what this is? I mean this is like a little, you're having a little battle for like whether or not you're going to let people profit off of crime. Like this is really what's happening. You have thought crime, he have intellectual crime, you plagiarism and you're allowing one person, you knowingly allowing them to profit off it and no one's doing anything about it. So when one of us does something about it, then you're going to punish that person. You're basically highlighting everything that everyone was afraid of. That's a good point. What is like, what were the, what was the reason for your being banned because you were, well, because become their end of it was because we had made a video with me and Carlos arguing on stage and then we put it on right now that all that this was, you know, somehow or another and in violation of that should have been kept inside the club and I'm like, you don't get it.

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       You weren't protecting us. No one was protecting us. My fucking agents dumped me over that. Oh yeah, over that. Yeah. I was with gurse. They dropped me. They'd call me up to tell me they essentially, in this long roundabout way, we're trying to say that I either had to apologize or they couldn't work with anymore though. That was the gist of it and I had to make them spell it out. Okay. Let me say this really clear. You tell me if this is what you're saying. You're saying you want me to apologize or you can't work with me anymore? Well, we're done now. There's no apology and we'll never get to work together. I appreciate everything you've done for me and I, it was really nice to the guy who was a, it wasn't his idea. My agent said, you're a great guy, bye. See you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       I'm giving you a hug. But you guys have to understand that you're making a choice. It's going to affect the rest of your life. This isn't just a small thing. You, you only have a few. How many years do you have in this life? Well, this year is going to be highlighted by this decision. This is going to be at why the agent take that stand. Did they represent him as yes. Yeah. Okay. Um, all right. So they needed to make nice with that thing. He goes, it made way more money than me. So it was, he was way more valuable to them. And so I'm like, you gotta make this is you sell art. It's all you guys do. Can you not making anything? You're just, if Mary Lynn comes up with the show, if this guy has a tour, if she's doing this or he's writing a book, you make money off art. That's how you make money off. Now here, you know a guy stealing other people's art and your answer to that is we got to stop people that are exposing it. Did he ever change or not that I even matters him. I hope he did. He's got to find Jesus. We just talking about this last night sort of. Yeah. Sort of. And then he kind of took it back.

Speaker 2:          00:08:06       It's hard to admit. Should I try? Should I try? This is insane. I actually only have like one set, right? Crazy. Do you know my friend Tate Tate Fletcher? Probably seen him around the store before. Big giant gorilla. Uh, it's his company. They're very good, but don't drink the whole thing. Mary Lynn. I like it, but I'm going to do it if it's a grand day coffee. Yeah, that's about it. Chronic and coffees where the caffeine, but it's strong. Yeah. Oh, she fog. I got to go work out in your isolation tank. Find Yourself. I just found myself and I peed a little. That's okay. Um, so you started out as a performance artists. Like that was your idea. What did you want to do that was your eye? That was your big idea. I went to art school for painting and I was uh, um, got really frustrated when people started to,

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       uh, critique the paintings and I was supposed to be, you know, getting more serious in art school and more conceptual and everyone was doing something different and everyone was critiquing it in a different way and none of it made sense to me. And then the idea of having to sell that object that you made, so you're going to make something that's useless. I mean it makes it sound like I don't like our appreciate art. I just, for me, I didn't, I couldn't grasp what the next thing to do was. You know, you're poor, you're an art school, you're making something and then you have to go sell and market that thing. And uh, I also was frustrated and, and kind of like boiling inside and needed to express myself. So I started doing performance art in school. And then when you say performance art, that's a pretty open ended description. Oh, it's so open ended. There were so many like weird performance art things that would happen. We, I mean we had performance art class, there was the guy that like taped his genitals to the side and put on lipstick in a mirror and that was his performance art piece or the girl that, and we would all sit there and watch it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:11       Did you see his genitals? Did he'd go naked and pull it aside or how did he do that? That's a really good question. I like how your mind just went there. You're like, what actually happened? I think I blocked it out because I think you could probably get away with doing that under the guise of it being something you're doing, you know, in a class somewhere. Yes, yes. You get away with us. So pervy I think I was focused on his beautiful lips. I was trying to be polite and not look down there. Another woman was obese and her piece was, she had preset up. We weren't it where she was doing the performance, uh, butter pats in like dominoes, like a, you know, a few thousand of them in a line. And she was obese and she crawled on the ground. She didn't actually eat them, but it was something that's weird.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       My mind kind of drops off. I remember specific parts of it, but I don't know. I think she just was collecting the butter pieces and crawling and that was her performance. He's another guy. Uh, the, uh, this was, I went to Detroit and then finished in San Francisco. And San Francisco is known for being a real performance art history. A lot of the, you know, the most famous performance artist. Nobody knows where that was. The scene was in San Francisco. So, uh, it was two story really beautiful campus, uh, overlooking. You could see a Lombard street on one side. You could see the water on the other side. And uh, another guy's piece was to jump from the second story to a tree to is like that. He may or may not have made the jump and that was his art, his art pieces. Jumping from a window to a tree.

Speaker 3:          00:11:44       Yeah. What the fuck? I know this other guy, the room where we had our class, he had a bread machine. This was back, you know, bread machines where new technology had a breadmaker. You know those machines you can make a, I guess it just does the dough, right? Right. Maybe it bakes it. I think it just needs the dough and then you bake it or I don't know if you bake it in the machine or no, you bake it in the machine. It's all coming back to me. He bakes it in the machine. We come into the classroom as he's baking it. There's always like a reveal and these pieces. Right? So we come in, he's taken plaster from the wall and put it in the bread. He's Fed us the bread. Half of us get it, half of us don't. And there's plaster in the price. Why did you put plaster in his bread? It was something about communism.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Some get the bread, some don't. But even if you get the bread, there's plaster. And so in your face, what the fuck? Oh my God. See there's something about like performance are in slam poetry. I did slam poetry to that was when Mike did. No, I did. Here's the best part is I got Zeros. Zeros. Yeah. You didn't get any why? I never really wrote any poetry. I was just into the performance of it. And I see you didn't have to poke. I was doing comedy. Oh No. And I was doing like an awkward thing, which was very real for me, but I think I just wanted to express my, I also had an ex boyfriend who

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       he said the comedy was his life. This was when I was like 19. And I think I attached to people, like I thought he was the shit because he would be rude to people. Like that was his version of comedy was like bossing people around or one of his bits was like having a whistle and directing traffic. I mean really adolescent like, but for some reason I was really attracted to him and uh, like I wanted to be him. Anybody who was like extroverted or something that I wanted, that I was attracted to that. Right. So, right. So he was like, comedy is my life and I do this open mic. And I was like, I'm going to do that open. Mike and I had taped like phrases to my body and phrases from commercials or snippets of conversation that I had heard and I went up and I started reading them and then I would improvise a little bit and I'd be like waxy build up or whatever and just repeating, just letting it all filter through and come out my mouth for five minutes of whatever the open mic was. And I started getting laughter, but it was like awkward laughter after the fact of that uncomfortable, like what? What is she doing? But my commitment level was so high that the fact that it didn't make any sense just because laughter. Right, right, right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Well that's us. That works sometimes with just even with comics. Yes, absolutely. There's a lot of people that are just really odd and if you saw them you would get it, but if you, you saw what they

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       wrote on paper is or what they said just written down on paper, you'd be like, what? That doesn't make any sense. Yeah. Well, I thought you were going to say, which is a similar point that, that, that it comes in the pause and after what they're saying, even if it doesn't make any sense, but you're saying sometimes people write things and it makes its own sense when you hear them say it, but it's also just about being fully commit. Yes, yes. Yeah. And those pauses. Yeah. That gives you, especially with something's really absurd, gives you that opportunity to go watch. Yeah. You don't want to just hammer them over the head with it. So you just started doing that. And how did it lead to actual stand up, stand up?

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       MMM,

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       it was a really fun time in San Francisco because the comedy clubs were closing, so a lot of comics were coming to these open mic poetry rooms. And one of my favorite rooms was in this bar. And also I was from the suburbs of Detroit. And so just being in San Francisco, that was a real city and a friendly city, you know, like it's small enough and it's beautiful and they have a real arts scene. And it was the first time that I had seen like a real counter culture and people that would hang out in coffee shops and, and a lot of young people that looked like I did. So I would go to bars for this open mic and there'd be um, you know, like I transvestite who was semi homeless, but it was, you know, made up who was like reading her poetry. And I was like, I'm in like, I'm done.

Speaker 3:          00:16:17       And I had no money and I would sit and crouch on the floor and drink like a half a beer and be like, oh, those, those crazy. And I would watch her read from her journal and I did a similar thing where I would just, and then it was always, I didn't, I didn't know my own mind or my own thoughts really. So I would write down random words and I would perform it. I mean it's still now it's, I've progressed a bit, but it's like, it informs you how the audience reacts or it begins to, and I just love seeing all these like different people and what, what they thought they were saying versus what they were really saying and what they're intended effect was and how people were really seeing them. Anyway, so, so comics started dropping into these rooms like Patton Oswald and, um, Jeremy Kramer and blink a patch and you know, uh, Greg Bear until these, uh, Ron Lynch, people that were more San Francisco affiliated that were there at that time, we'd start doing these open Mike Nights. Um, but because a comic is so versed in their own voice that watching them was so, I was like, oh, that they know how to speak and they're more polished. And then that was attractive to me. So, so I kind of gravitated towards, and there were all these alternative rooms that weren't comedy clubs. And that was like, I loved that. I just loved it because there was room for mistakes. There was room for the in between, you know, it was like that, the real allseen of that time. Yeah. That all

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       seems interesting. It's always interesting when like a little branch of a style of comedy breaks off, you know? And some people do it because that's like it's, it feels more true to them. Right. And then some people do it because it seems like the cool hip thing to do and then some people it's just a combination of bolts. Right. The all teens. An interesting scene, you know, cause it also is attached to that one place. It doesn't pay anybody. The UCB. Yeah. I was always like, wait, what? Oh you mean cause they're making money and no one else's Nikki. Yeah. I was always like, what? Huh? Like how does that make sense? People don't get paid at comedy clubs as well. Well sure they do. Comedy store pays you, you mean like 25 bucks, 25 bucks for regular sets. And then do you get a lot more than that?

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       If you do the main room, the main room, they pay your real money. You're saying, why doesn't ucb throw 25 bucks to people that you have to pay if something people are paying to go there, right. Paying for gas there, they're traveling, they're right, and you're selling tickets to see them do their art. Right. That's how it ain't to take that line. Then everybody should be paid a lot more. There should be genuine percentage. It's really only the comics. Going back to that argument from a comedy store from the 70s that was a, it's a legit argument. I mean, it's not legit that, look, this is where we live and it's a really important place to work out. Right, right. So we need it and we want it to be there. Yeah. And they pay you a little bit. But if they didn't pay you anything, like the comedy store went ucb and just didn't pay anybody anything.

Speaker 2:          00:19:22       Oh, that's interesting. So you're saying isn't important. It's something. Yeah, like especially it was important when the club wasn't making any money. So if the club, I'm in the old days, the, oh, or you know, you got that 25 bucks. Like, look, they've given 25 bucks to 15 people. Fine. How much money are they really making? I get what you're saying. You're saying has that vibe of like a, it's a workshop and then you're like, you guys are making money off of their opening up new places, right? I mean this is a business, right? I'm not telling them what to do or telling anybody your performance or what do I performed there before? Right. It's just, it's kind of weird. It's like these festivals, I got invited to one of those festivals once they offered to give me a pass, like a gold pass where I could watch all the other acts. That's what they were going to pay me with. They weren't going to fly me. They weren't gonna put up right in a hotel. They weren't going to give me any money.

Speaker 3:          00:20:11       It reminds me of that thing and Steve Martin's book where he's, where he made that choice and again, a very different time, very different scene where he's like, I'm only headlining for money. But he made that conscious choice that would not work now. And like you said, we, you know, I work out in town, I don't expect to get paid, but it does, it makes a difference that the comedy store, there's a, that system that is in place really works. You know, it's like I'm a paid regular. That was a big deal. Yeah. Cause I remember I had been on, on the road doing comedy really for the first time in the club proper, even though I had tons of stage time. But you know, back connecting back to that all seen where it would be a different thing every time. And I did not quite know what I was saying. So, you know, in the past four years was when I did the six shows per weekend. And you're like, I'm your entertainment for the night. And I, you know, learn how to do that. Like people came out to see you. Yes. And like you don't mumble. Tell them what you're talking about. Repeat your theme, you know, smile, talk to people. Uh, you know, I learned how to do that. And um, what was my point? Oh, in any way confined by that

Speaker 2:          00:21:17       because you, your beginnings were so sort of free and

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       I think it's like a reverse. The confinement of that is serving me because I needed to do that. It took me, I went about it like completely opposite. I was so organic that now I'm finally getting some structure. I'm Mike for the first time. Like, oh, that's a joke. I read a joke. I honestly, it was like, like I said, I had no idea why people were laughing. I knew I liked it, but I wasn't exactly sure where it was going to come. And I knew that I had a deep connection to it. You know? That's what propelled me to do it. I had a need to, to do it. It was the only thing and it kind of saved me. I needed to, I mean not to get all overly dramatic comedy kind of saved you performing. Yeah. Cause I just was really, um, uh, didn't know how to express myself. And it's still to this day is like in ever kind of deepening thing, you know? Yeah. It's a, it's a very weird discipline, right? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:22:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       It's a weird thing to get involved with, you know, chase down these ideas and try to figure out how to flesh them out. And

Speaker 3:          00:22:33       do you structure that you feel like you were always, um, cause I see you as somebody who's like so powerful and such, such a strong point of view in both strong belief system. Do you feel like you've always kind of been that way?

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       No, I don't think so. I think comedy for sure. It makes you chase down those ideas. Like what is, what is your real feelings on things? Yeah. Because you're thinking about things so often and then as you're saying things, you think about people's reaction to them. That's a big one. A big one is the comedy has allowed me to really pay attention to other people's reactions more than like I think our wanted to because I think if I had my own way and I had nothing to do with stand up, I probably would be way more antisocial, way more guarded and protected and way more insecure because I hadn't answered those questions. I didn't pose them up myself cause it made me uncomfortable. Yeah. So what standup allowed me to do, it's like I wasn't the most outgoing person. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. I was very insecure and uh, even so I would get like social anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:23:39       I've talked about this before, but I would like talking to a bank teller. I'd be no, I'd know that I'm next to talk to the bank tower and I'd kind of freak out and I wouldn't know how to, I would, wouldn't exactly know how to talk and say things and do it right. But it changed from teaching martial arts. I want to start teaching martial arts. I learned how to project in front of this big room full of people. It's something I never imagined I was going to do any public speaking before that it was never on the menu. I never even thought about it. But when I taught classes I had to teach them and I was teaching like in universities, I've taught at bu and I taught at some other places, some other gyms and stuff. And you know, you have to get these people's attention.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       You have to be clear and you have to have confidence and, but I knew what I was doing. Martial arts ask you that. It probably helped a lot for sure. If you were nervous, you were like, let the skill kind of takeover. We would oftentimes, if we opened up a new school somewhere where we'd do a demonstration and then we did give a speech afterwards, explain what the martial arts were. But we'd do a demonstration for us. Like people would hold like boards and shit and he'd kick him and stuff like that, which we never did in real life. We only did for demonstrations. Like we never trained that way. But my point was like getting into stand up. I didn't have a particularly clean point of view. I think I was 21 years old. I was, I think it was a moron. You know, I didn't have any life experience other than martial arts and girls. Like that was all I could talk about. And I didn't, I knew martial arts weren't really funny, so it was just relationship stuff. But um, hey guys, how about when we hit that block? We don't really do that. I'm all right. I was kicking those blocks of wood guys. Seriously. Yeah. I mean, I had a similar thing of it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:23       It helps, yeah. To just even say anything and to be like, oh, I exist. I have a voice and I'm just now starting to, I mean, I've a lot of material that's true, but I'm just now kind of starting to build that deeper, um, the belief system thing. You know, like I talk about my personal life and there are kernels of things in there, but it's, it's scary to kind of come out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:49       Yeah. But it's fun because that's what people want, you know? That's what, like, that's what gets it going and that's what gets everybody excited. And that's what, uh, that's cool. Yeah. You know what comedy is Tommy? One really important thing as a person, you're not done. Like there's no, there's no like you're a finished product. Yeah, I did it. No, your change, depending upon your attitude about how you look at your very existence right now, I get you in shift within an hour. It could shift back and forth. You could, it could shift in a day or two. It's like if you take a few weeks off of standing up, can I ask you that? Do you, is it hard for you to get back? Chat always feels weird. I haven't done it very often, but um, I did it a couple of times in my career where I got like surgery or something like that and I had to take some time off and then I got burnt out once, maybe like five years ago and I took three months off.

Speaker 2:          00:26:38       And also that, that was crazy. That was real weird. But then when I got back into it, it was before I came back to the store too. So it was a real issue with me. Like going on stage, like the Improv never felt like home. It was like a place to fuck around. It's a nice club, but it never, I didn't hang out there. It just felt weird. Didn't feel the same. So I'd just do a set there and then I'd get out of here. So I was missing like the camaraderie aspect of it and I had just finished a special and I just didn't want to do anything for awhile. I wanted to chill and so I took like three months off. But then when I came back I came back with like a lot of purpose, like a really was enthusiastic about it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:16       I had been thinking about coming back for like a couple of weeks before I actually did it. But um, you, you're always working at it like always, it's always, you're always, you're always in, in, in the process of like reaffirming, thinking things through, understanding who you are. It varies with your health, varies with how you're eating. It varies with who's in your life. Like your comedy radically varies. Like how you interface with an audience radically. How you look at yourself. All that vary so much. It's never done. Have you ever been on stage and just, uh, been, not angry but like not enjoying, kind of not wanting to be on stage and it shows in your performance there. Do you always get out of it through performing then you can get upset. There's, there was a woman who kept heckling me in the front row of the comedy store just interrupting to stopping bits before I had a chance to explain them.

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       And then finally I had to kick her out and it was so annoying. The way she did it was, it was so entitled, like she was entitled to voice out her opinion in the middle. It wasn't what I was doing. This chunk last year on my last special about this guy who broke into the White House, that a guy just broke into the White House. You would think there would be all these things in place to keep someone for breaking the White House. The guy just humped across the lawn, ran across lauren gods in the front door and there was only a girl sitting there, one unarmed girl by herself. He smacked her the ground and just ran to the fucking White House. And I had this whole bit about who's idea it was to have this leave a girl by herself. I've seen. Yeah. And then then I said that this is the part, like this lady interrupted me.

Speaker 2:          00:28:58       Um, I said, a lot of people think that women can do anything men can do. Right. And I go, well that doesn't make sense because men can't even do everything men can do. So I was in the middle of saying that doesn't even make sense because, and the joke is an idea. Explain it. Do I go I, the joke is lady, I've met Shaquille o'neal and his Dick is where my face is and if the White House has experienced in a shack attack, I'm the wrong dude to save the world. He's going to run me over. But you know, and that I tried to explain that and like she just wanted to interrupt anything that had to do with men or women. So that was annoying. And I did not have a good set that night cause it was like Jesus Christ crisis, get the fuck out of here and had a kid. And she had apparently had done that to some guys that were on before and she was so drunk when I was looking at it in their eyes, weren't focusing just just some smart lady that was drunk that thought she could stop what she thought was sexism probably because she was drunk. But there's a difference between like you then overcoming it and being like, ha ha, that was awesome. And then the feeling of I think what I'm, I was tense.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       Yeah. Like that where you're just inside your own head going, I don't want to be here like

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       that sacked like it's not fun that it was just like I shouldn't have allowed myself to get so upset. But I, I came into the stage upset. That was part of the problem is that I had a crazy day with a lot of fucked up things happened and I carry that energy onto the stage. There was a lot of weird shit that happened in my life that day. It was just like enough, enough fucking enough and then her own, yeah, it was like weird shit with friends and a couple of weird business things. It was like a compounding day and then this lady was hammered and just, and, and I, I gave her the bed, I tried to talk her into just release and explained there, this is how the bit would have gone if you didn't know rob. I go, okay, get it. See, I'm gonna say something outrageous.

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       Then I'm going to say something more fucked up about myself. This is what I do. So I did it again and she interrupted again. I'm like, get the fuck out. Just get out. Just get out. And I was, but it was really upset and you shouldn't really get upset. So when you allowed yourself get really upset, it's usually because you came into it unbalanced. And again, right? It's always you're death, you're never done. Like you might think, well, I understand how to behave now. I've got my shit together. I get it. But you don't, you do, you get it right now. But if you let it slip, you won't get it tomorrow. If you have the wrong attitude or the wrong approach and the wrong dude cuts you off, you're like fuck off. Like, ah, that come from shit. You know? And yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:31:30       going back to what we were talking about earlier, that when you said you're not awkward, I you two things, you are, you're much more of a teddy bear now than you used to be. Don't you think?

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       I've never thought of myself as a teddy bear, but,

Speaker 3:          00:31:44       well, when I see, and now you're just like, you're just not, I don't, I'm not saying you weren't like this before, but you just are so like positive and loving, loving and kind of like, you know, you can feel it and whereas, you know, there's a lot of baggage in the past and we never, not baggage, but like, I was like, oh, that guy hates women or that guy hates me. But that was also when Duncan was hanging out with you. You know, he and I, he just broke up. So that was the baggage I was referring to, but like, oh, you know, I just thought, you know, you have such a strong energy that I was like, oh that guy and I, not that I,

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       it's weird because I wasn't like, I just was, I just never pictured us talking easily. Yeah. Not saying that it wouldn't have happened then it cause it just didn't, but I was like, Whoa, what's up with that dude? I get it. I've said odd onstage a bunch of times. I like, I look like a sexist. Like I look like

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       that I would be a dick. I just, that's what I look like. You know, there's like not much you can do it, but if you lift weights and you have a fat head, you know, you look like a dickhead. There's just right. There's no way around it. I was like kind of watching some of your recent podcasts where it was like one of the shirts, the feminine for the future is feminine, Feminine. I want to where I want to, where the future is masculine and you where the future is feminine. And then we just walk around or whatever. And opposite. Like if I built my compound it'd be like crystals and lavender and soft. You know what the problem with that statement, the future is feminist is the problem with every single statement. You cannot boil down the future of one fucking sentence. You just can't be funny.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       Preposterous. It would be fine. I would like to just where the future is masculine and just not acknowledge it. What's up? Yeah. The future's masculine guys get used to it. I should roll pack of cigarettes. And what are your sleeves like? The fonz fuck you man. Is that masculine? Yeah. No it makes no sense. No silly. Oh and then the other thing that when I was talking about going on the road, um, which I was going to mention coming back to the store, cause I was there in the 90s to when it was just like a terrible place and a bad vibe and like dark and Dank. And what year did you get there? Uh, I moved to La in [inaudible] 94 and I was in San Francisco, Cisco for a couple of years before that. [inaudible] 94 or 95 or six. You perform at the clubs in San Francisco as well? I did.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       Um, we did bars. I never did the punchline. You still done it? Have you done it? So I have, yeah, it's fun. It's great. I love it. Yeah. COBB's was a little strange. Big Ceiling. It's so big and the people were way back there that are in the balcony there way back. Oh my gosh. Hi. Hi back there. My husband who like he used to before we had a child, he used to come see my one woman show that I did. I think he came like, anyway, he saw me at cobbs and he sat back there and he, it was a great assessment cause he goes, you've gotten really good because I had met on the road, but he goes, that's a really hard room because these people, especially that late show, like they've just had dinner and they're there and it's so dark and it's, it's like a room.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       I don't know. Some people love it, but it's a room that's sort of seen its heyday at a different time that it would be packed out. I don't know. Maybe you like it if you pack it out there to see you. I do like that room, but it's a different room than it used to be. Do I used to the old cobb's? That's where I met 'em man. I did. That's where I met Alma. I'll juggle all magical. Started working together and like 1919 fucking eight or some shit. Yeah, it was a long time ago, but I'm, the old one was tiny, like just a little bit bigger than the belly room.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       I mean it was like like a hundred seats or something like that was really ridiculously small. I think I might be off by a little, it might be like 130 but they would stuff everybody in there to get 130 and it was this tiny little club and I used to work at, even though, um, it would actually, I could make less money there then I could at at the punchline. I liked it better. I was like, this place is better. It's like, it's grimy, it's tiny. And then Tom saw, or the guy who ran it was like a s a huge comedy nerd, like a dude, really love comedy. And so I liked that and they're like, good, he's supporting good comedy. Fuck it. So I started going there. So then when they turned it into the new place, I was like, this is the opposite of what you guys, right. You guys were the most intimate club and now you're the cavernous. That makes sense. Cause it, yeah. Clubs have to be like, there's got to be right on top of you.

Speaker 3:          00:36:27       Okay. I came back from going on the road for the first time and doing the six shows and I was on 24, which I love the word just full on comedy shop talking by the way that we do that all the time. I do that a long time. Does it feel unusual? No, no. I know, I like it. I like it. Um, I just got a little self conscious for a minute anyway. The rooms and the ceiling.

Speaker 2:          00:36:54       That's interesting. Funny thing. I think people enjoy it too because they're like hearing people who were professionals talk about what makes it good and what makes it bad. Then when they're there themselves like, oh yeah, the room's Kinda high on this place. Oh, this place is intimate.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Okay. So I was on, uh, you gave me the confidence to get back in it. So I was on 24 when it came back and we filmed in London because it had been done for like two years and they brought it back and it was the end of that airing and it was the first time I was going on the road as a comic. So because my face was on TV and people were super into 24, my shows packed out the first time I'd ever gone on the road. Right. My first 45 50 minute show and I first hit the stage at like side splitters Tamba or whatever, you know, he's like, use all your shows are sold out. And um, first of all, my opener and my middle are like, this is great. It's sold out. But then when they got on the stage, they come up, they're like, your audience is weird because they're 24 fans and they were all, they don't come out to clubs.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       Right, right, right, right. Like I would sometimes have somebody sitting, like with this guy had an article of clothing that I had worn and season three, so I'm like trying to do comedy. Like, oh, okay, like you just want me to sign your thing. But you know, in my approach was, because I'm in my own head, so I'm like, hi. So my name's Mary Lynn and doing, doing my like I'm uncomfortable. And that's where my comedy comes around. And the whole vibe was like, what? You know, like your TV star. Like we came to see you and I, and I had to adjust and like take that in and then not only take it in but talk about it, you know, like, yeah, you know, and I would just be like Jack Bauer and they'd be like, ha ha. Like losing their shit and like, wow, I would just make somebody in the audience like my Jack Bauer

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and then I just, you know, how to make it like five, 10 15 minutes of like, let's talk about it. Because it was such an amazing thing, you know? And it was to me too, but I had this hope that was the only drama I had ever been on. And I have this whole other world of comedy that I had been doing, but the intersection of that was just like bizarre. But, but then I, you know, like you said, you're never done and you never know what's going to happen and you adjust to it. So I would do the 24 stuff and then I would go into my stuff. That's my stuff about my life and my personal life and my point of view. And then that became really gratifying. You know, once I sort of brought them in, did the thing that they needed to hear about, which is also part of my life.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       So you know, how long did it take before they stop coming to see you? Because you're from 24 and started coming to see you because you're a funny comic. Oh, I'm still waiting for that to happen. I'm still hoping for a career in comedy. No, seriously. Then it dropped off. Right. So I did that same circuit a year and a half later and there'd be some super fans or be some comedy fans and there'd be some people that didn't know why the hell they were there. So then I would have, yeah, the guy that knows me from always sunny in Philadelphia at the lady that knows me from 24 and the guy who was out of his mind on drugs going, you're not funny. And I'm like, this poor person's like, she's the superstar. Like why is she in this shit hole? And then other guys, like I don't know who she is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       And then that guys like, you don't get what I get because she's from always sunny in Philadelphia. And then I would pit them against each other. I'm like, she doesn't get it. But you get it. And it's like the burden of being so versatile, you know, such a cross to bear. It must've been a fun transition though once you got through the initial stages because a lot of people would have bailed like a lot of people. Okay. Fuck, fuck doing in the road. This is just too crazy. Yeah. I love it. I mean it sucks, but I love it. It's awesome. But it's sorta changed who you are then what you think of you. So you're like a real comic now. Yeah. Yeah. You know, for so many years I had that little like, oh, you haven't done the road, like you haven't really done it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:42       And now I'm like, no, no, I, I know how to do the fuck. There's so many people that don't do the road that I wish would leave. You know, like God, you got to experience it. You've got to go out there, you and, but they don't want to do like the Shitty road. Well, you have to do the Shitty road. I also learned something about myself, the Shitty road, um, because I, I would not have a car and I take the hotel that they gave me that would be by the freeway, that would be not even near the city and a little bit from the club. And I just hold up and then I, it took me a while to realize like, oh, you like that. Like I like a certain amount of suffering and like, uh, so shitty here. I'm going to go like walk along the freeway and then, you know, someone would be like, why don't you, why didn't you get a car? And like, I don't know, I just walked over to Chili's for lunch and uh, along the grass and the side of the freeway. I like it. I like it. So you actually like

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       the dinginess of weird cities. So are we saying yeah, or I don't know. The part of me likes the shittiness of it, just to like, there was one house gask I don't know why there was one hotel room that had like

Speaker 3:          00:41:52       got a dining room table for 10 and like this big, these big plastic flowers with dust all over them and this weird hot plate with foil on it and a walk in closet. But it was the shittiest most run down, like who's who's partying in here? Like who's fancy hotel suite is this. It couldn't have been shittier. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:15       And it was, yeah, I guess it's just fascinating. And, and I, I like being comfortable, you know, I like having my things, but I guess I like that too. Yeah. I like feeling the pain of that. What? Whatever. I'm just not being comfortable, but it also, because it's in contrast to your life in La, right? I mean, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:38       Fucking TV star. Got some cash. Hmm. All right. So then you can do it on the road all the time. I've seen those pictures on instagram and you just throw it and gold. She's throwing it up in the air. Ooh. Um, but here thing is isolation tank. Mine is, I get in one of those blowers where the money, that's what I do in the morning. I just get my little room. I'm like the money, it's just a cycle and have hundreds of around me. I get up money massage. Yeah, it's so great. But when you're in the road and you're in like a shitty hotel in Pittsburgh or something, it's in the middle of January. You look out in the skies. I got shitty dark, smoky gray. There's not even a hint of Sun. It's noon. You look out nothing. Yeah. Everybody's got this look on their face. Everybody just sour puss, just wiping dust off the window. So

Speaker 3:          00:43:31       I like that weird air conditioning or heater that doesn't really work and just crank on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the middle of the night. You can't control them.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       An asshole man.

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       I once had a lady in a hotel room. Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       how did this go? She was the receptionist. God, it's all a blur. I don't even remember what city it is. Um, one of those low, mid hotels. She calls me, I'm napping. It's like after you do the radio or something. I'm napping. Oh, hi. Um, there's a fan down here with a bottle of wine for you. Can I send him up? Swear to God. I've never felt more unsafe or on the verge of a breakdown. First of all, you woke me up. Second of all, you're, you're the gateway between, but it was such a small town and it was so, such a foreign concept to her. To me, I was like, that's inherent. Like you're right, you're the protection that I have from, should I send him up a stranger who stopped at the hotel, drugs with a bottle of wine, got a bottle of drugs for you.

Speaker 3:          00:44:43       Should I send him up? Seemed like a good move. And then you know what I did as I actually took his car, I could hear him in the background go. No, no, no. That's okay. Like he actually was a nice guy, but nice enough of a person that would do that. Wanted to bring a bottle of wine. That was, I think that was her idea. And so then I started like, instead of going, what the fuck are you talking about? I just went, oh, okay, well I'll come down and get it. And then I came down and met him and, but it was so unsettling and that was her idea. It wasn't his idea. But instead of saying don't do that and setting her straight, I took the middle road. And how well did you go back to sleep after that? Not so good. Right. I drank that bottle of wine and had the best show of my life. I'm over at the show.

Speaker 2:          00:45:31       Yeah, that's creepy. It's, um, Ali Wong has a great bit, I'm not going to do it justice. Uh, and I don't want to paraphrase it either and I want to tell anybody what it's about, but it's essentially the difference between life for a woman comic on the road versus a white, young male comic. You know, it's a big difference. Yeah. The uh, the danger level, like that's like guys that get to get obsessed with you. You know, I want to bring you wine shit and like that stuff that's gotta be weird.

Speaker 3:          00:45:58       I had another guy, it was the guy who held the sweater. He's like, it's your sweater from season three but you want somehow online. He bought it and then after the show he won. He showed me, I don't know what's wrong with me because I'm like, he was a really nice guy. Like this is a terrible situation, but I, for whatever reason I'm like, he needs me to listen to him right now. And I stood there like, what is wrong with me? He had two thick photo books of the thousands of dollars of memorabilia and the pictures of all the items and the itemized of shit from the show. And again, I'm there. I'm looking around like anybody seeing this, not just me and him. Okay. Yeah. You guys continue cleaning. Cause that's the weird thing too, because I'm a superstar on one end, but on the other end it's like, not really, I don't have the money. I'm not bringing anyone with me. I'm right. You know, I'm like a regular headliner on the braces.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       Do have security though, right? Most places they, yeah, sure. Yeah. They just probably weren't aware that they should be paying attention.

Speaker 3:          00:47:01       Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe they thought, yeah, that's a friend of hers. That's also a weird thing, right?

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       When do you step in? The guy's got a bunch of books filled with memorabilia. Okay. Like when that seems okay. Like that doesn't, it's just a, he's a very, very, very enthusiastic fans. Yes. But lego, what point in time is that right?

Speaker 3:          00:47:16       Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why don't, you know, ultimately, I'm glad I did it because I feel like I validated him even though I wanted to go, like, what happened? You spent $75,000, all that stuff like, but

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       what can you do? So it was like, that's, this is great. Terrific. You did a really good job. She just reached out with a pair of scissors. This is for you. And if you're listening, you did do a really good job and you have a lot of really cool stuff that no one else has. There you go. And I'm happy for you. Was it, it's always weird when you're a comic too and your or your comedian in nature and um, you, you do something that's not comedic, right? Yeah. Like if you're a comedian and you do a drama show like 24, it was basically like a drama, right? Slas. What are the most serious shows ever, ever write super job? I think I messed up. I should have just rolled into another drama. I had to open my mouth and show everybody how not the computer genius I am like, what is wrong with me?

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       I'm a Wa I've set up obstacles. You know her from 24 what welcome the comedy stylings of what? Do you remember what Richard Belzer going on? Law and order. Oh yeah. And everybody was like, what? And then stop being funny. Like he doesn't do any common anymore. I don't think, I think that should clean up my act. Should I only be funny now or should I get another drama? Well I think you should stay funny. Just be the funny, just do that. Oh, I never completed this. Whatever the story of going through being on the road. And then coming back to the store and thinking like I got it cause I've been on the road. Right. Coming back doing the main room, don't got it at all. Dry Mouth, terrible set guy in the front row is mining falling asleep and mouthing to me how boring I am because I'm like wow, his intense.

Speaker 1:          00:49:20       But that's also the beauty of the store because you cause you're like, oh that was one thing on the road and this is another thing. Like you got to go deeper and get real. It's running with a weight vest on. That's what I describe it. You can run faster. The weight vest on if your legs are strong, but otherwise you're going to be fucked. Yeah, I love it now. Yeah, it's, it's an intense place. I remember you and I were talking about something there once, like fairly recently within the last year where you're like, I don't know what I'm doing. Oh yeah. I told you I might get the quitting. I quit. What? Are you serious? I couldn't tell if you're serious or deadly. Let's meet every six days or if I take more than two days, awesome, I'm done. I need to talk to anybody or go anywhere or do anything. I'm done. Like that's my nature. That's what I fight with. What brings you back? What gets you from there to fuck it. I'll just go do it. I just force myself. But you don't have a hundred percent confidence and your future resolve

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       like you don't know in the future. Do you think there's gonna come a time where you just a week turns into a month, turns into a year and then 24 again comes on? We didn't. They do 24 for the black guy. Was there a reason? Is that still okay? It's still good now. It's done. It's done. I did it with a whole new cast. I think it went one season. Well that's what happens. Fucking white people. You ruined it. Thanks. White people, white people. He didn't promote it good enough. You promoted great for Kiefer Sutherland. I didn't understand what you're getting on with that black actor and you fucking halfass and cancel it before people grew to love it. I think that was a pretty tough act to follow. I'm sure. Yeah. People get angry when you reduce something, you know, you call it the same thing like fuck off.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       It's not 24 I will come up with another name. Oh yeah. I think that was the higher world's in trouble. I like that. Cool Black Guy. Who was the guy that played the Corey Hawkins. Is that right? I don't know who that gentleman is. Great. They fucked him. Goddamn white people. Fuck Ah, white people. That's my take on it. So are you going to do a specialty thing? I like to. I like to. He should. I want, yes. I think you're very funny. Thanks girl. I do. Thank you. I do. I think you're hilarious. I'm glad you're doing it. Still. Like when you were telling me that that you were going to quit. I'm like, you know, you are my angel that night. You really where you lifted me up from the depths. I love that. You're like, where are you serious? It make no you, you lifted me up and the depths of hell.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       Well, I could tell you a really down. I was like, that's crazy. I know, I know. Who's funny. You're hilarious and you really nice. You know. So it was like, you know, it's a weird thing to do. It's weird thing to do and maybe you don't have to. None of us do it really. I mean, there's gonna come a point in time in my life for, I'm probably, I'm not going to do this anymore, but for right now. But that's cool that you, um, uh, pretty love the live show as much as you do. It's a struggle I would love. I really enjoy struggling. I do think it's very important. It's very important for my balance as a person, especially me, I have maniacal genetics. My brain is just constantly, constantly overrun with things to think about and do. My brain just wants to go, just come up, let's go.

Speaker 2:          00:53:06       We need more fucking stimuli shot. Let's go. There's no to, we'd always need something. So what I do is just stuff it filled with information, work it out, get it to run hills and do Jujitsu and yoga and burn that motherfucker out so that I could be calm. And so what you've lot of what people notice today versus how I was like 20 years ago is this, this, I understand myself better. I'm better at managing my, like whatever are the things that make you, you, I'm better at managing those to be very positive, to just be just overall in my attitude is very different to it's overall just nicer to people. And how did you become nicer? Just realize that when I'm at my best, that's who I am. And the only variation between that and when I'm at worst. You weren't nice before? Yeah, it was nice. I just wasn't as Nice Sam now I've always been nice, but I've always been nice. I, I'm quicker to pull the trigger back then. Right. You know, and I'm, I'm less

Speaker 3:          00:54:06       must remember we were at the comedy store, this is pretty recently. And uh, that guy came into the bathroom when I was in there. You totally pulled like the best male like strong guy. It was, it was so good. Your leg. Cause I, I think the guy was like on coke or a combo of something. And again, it's like do I not have regard for my own being because a part of me kind of left my body and was like, wow, this guy is crazy cause he's like, give me a kiss. And this is like in the women's bathroom. Right, right, right, right. And then I think someone that he had done it to someone else, so it was kind of going around and then I ran into you and I was like, yeah, that just happened to me. And you were like, what? Where is he? And you were immediately like, I'm going to beat his ass. But simultaneously you were like, get security to get this guy. It was so awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:54:58       Well that guy was a creep. It was so creepy. I was upset that I wasn't there as it was happening. I now, yeah, that's unfortunate that you're always going to have to, I rarely like enjoy or or that like that

Speaker 3:          00:55:13       bonds that you had. I was like, that was awesome. I like that as you rarely can be a lady after all. I just don't know how to do it. Well. I miss the boat, but I

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       only reason why you can enjoy it is because it is in stark contrast to how I behave when people are nice. So you realize there's a difference, right? It's like it's break class, break glass in case of emergency, you know that was an emergency. Like this is a real creep. It's cool to see that coked up assholes at that fucking store. Lately there's so many coked up. Weirdos cook must be making a comeback and Hollywood, it must be kind of like put my blinders on to it probably. Sure. There's a lot of people with fucking bright eyes and ideas and business plans. They want to fucking

Speaker 3:          00:56:05       pitch away. That's what I need. If you're the overactive, I'm the opposite. Like if I see a bed out of the corner of mine, I'm like, ah, that can be great right now. Like that's my avoidance tactic. Just like this. Got To sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:56:18       Yeah, I can't do that. Does work. I just lie there and think, but my sort of route

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       of the discovering like my hidden anger core, I'm like, oh, like peeling off the layers of like, oh, she's uncomfortable, she's quiet, she doesn't react. And it's like, oh no, no, no, they're in there. You've just buried them like all of your feelings in like politeness. And so that's comedy has helped me with that too. Cause I early on I was like way too reactive. I'd be like, Oh, what do you think? Like talking to an audience member, it's like, no, you're in control. Like you tell them where it's going, you steer it like yes, you can listen to it. But um, so that's, it's teaching me that as well. How to like drive the train instead of like, I'm going to be open to you and listen and go wherever you want me to go, you know, and just react to you. There's also like, there's a weird feedback loop thing going on there because people like it when you go, oh well what do you think? So you liked the fact that they liked that you do that and then you avoid the conflict that way, but then you have to swallow it for the rest of the day. It was, you know, he's totally,

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       that's true. Yeah. Well I mean it's like I said, like being a person and being a comic, very similar in that you're never done. There's never done. You know, you're always trying to fix that thing. Was trying to tweak it, make it a little better. And then that's like one of the big arguments for writing new material to the idea is that every time you write a new act, especially when you have to like really so special or something like that, you're going to be better. Cause you, you understand comedy better than you did two years ago. You're just going to be better. If you've really been paying attention and you really are looking at it correctly, you're going to be better. But God, it's so hard cause you right. You want to avoid it. You want to go to that bed. It's right there. It's right there in radio land.

Speaker 1:          00:58:12       CHICAGO, Zee. Hello. Oh, you get your pets in the bed with you? Oh yeah. They keep 'em out. Cause my allergies. But then when they surround me, what are you allergic to? Everything. Do you have any cats and dogs and you're allergic to them? Yeah, my husband got the cat. That's what put it over the edge. I had two dogs for the longest time and I ignored it. And then it's the weather and the cat and I just went over this edge where I always had like this really bad cold. And then I finally had to go and I tried to all the organic things and I finally had to go and get the like twice a week. But when they tested it, it was like everything just like paper and pollen and pets and a paper. You're allergic to paper. Yeah. Wow. Uh, but then I got those shots twice a week and with the shots do I kind of Miss My allergist?

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       We would have little four minute chats. Uh, it's like you're an ocular rating, so you start doing a little bit and then you build up your tolerance so they can inoculate you for cat dander. Real. Yeah. That's sort of an allergy shot is I didn't even know that there were allergy shots. Yeah. And He, it's like a little cocktail, like all the things cocktail for me of all the things that I'm allergic to and then I just build up my tolerance. Wow. So now if you're around a cat and nothing, yeah, I cuddled him. No Shit. We make out. Yeah. And it used to be if a cat just like licked you or touched your hand or something like that, you would get like little, little rub. A little red area. Yeah. Or like, yeah. Inflamed. Yeah. One of my daughters is allergic to cats.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       We had to figure it out. It took a while. She'd like wake up with puffy eyes and then we got a tested and realized it was a cat. So what'd you do? She takes a pill? No, no, the cat went to, uh, my other daughter, my oldest daughter. Okay. So she's got it. Her apartment, I used to be allergic to feathers. I remember sleeping over someone's house. It depends on like where my system is of how it affects me sometimes. Yeah. Like the other pillow. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. I know people that are allergic to like, like Styrofoam. I've heard of people who are allergic to like certain types of plastic and shit. Yeah. Just coming in contact with certain plastics, make them break out my, my making this up, it feels like bullshit. I got the Epi pen once. Whoa. From getting the shots. That was really exciting.

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       So you got the shots, your body went into shock because of all the allergic shots. And then they had a fucking boom right in the thigh. And My allergist was like, he did it in my arm and he, he said, I didn't even raise it that much, but I went home and I was reading and I'm like, God, I itchy. Oh, I must, I must have been sweating. Like I worked out and I need to, I didn't for like a full 10 minutes. I wasn't conscious. I was just subconsciously gone. Man. I gotta go take a shower or something and then I lift it up and it was like traveling and then I just was like, I'm having a attack. Like I need a Benadryl. And like no one was listening to me and I'm like, Hey, I think I need a Benadryl. And I, I didn't, I was looking for the Benadryl, couldn't find it.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       Called my allergist. And he goes, yeah, I just come here right now. And then I drove there just like so scared cause I could feel it traveling and I'm like, you know, panicking but also trying to like manage like when you panic and it's a good thing because you have to act fast. And then I thought, are my eyes going to close up? Is my throat going to close up? And then went in there full on Epi pen. It's awesome. It was really good. It felt like, it honestly felt like I was about to go onstage. Ooh, like a rush. Yeah, it was kind of great feeling, but it's almost like it like feels like tinny and like real trevally like, like you get like for a few seconds and trevally bless Augusta. Yeah, like not even caffeine, like beyond caffeine, but, but yeah, like a pure, a dry, it felt like a real exciting standup show. Wow. I'm really excited to go on stage

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       right now. And that immediately stops the allergic reaction. Yeah. Wow. That's incredible. What do you got it? That's what it is. The EPI pen is adrenaline. Oh Wow. That's a crazy, I've done that on an episode of 24 where the character dies and the Epi pen in the heart and they wake back up. So epinephrin is adrenaline. Wow. It was awesome. I liked it. I wouldn't do it every day if I could. You should do it every day. It's a hormone, neurotransmitter and medication. Epinephrin is normally produced, but both of your dream of glands and certain neurons plays an important role. The fight or flight response by increasing blood flow to the muscles output or the heart trouble feel. Oh Wow. Pupil dilation. Wow. And then then other stuff that you get from luck, cold shock proteins. That's norepinephrine. Is that what it is? That's the way that Doctor Rhonda Patrick was a, she's a giant proponent of a sauna and also of cryotherapy.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       And she was talking about the benefits of cold shock proteins. And one of them is, uh, your body freaks out when you go into those cryotherapy chambers, cause it's like 250 degrees below zero. So you get this big powerful burst of norepinephrine. You get cold shock proteins. These sidechains cause your body's trying to react to the fact that you have this massive cold environment that you're just trapped in. It's like so fucking cold. Your body freaks out and it produces this really radical anti inflammation process. And one of them is this stuff. Okay. And that's as a trend that known also known as noradrenaline. Oh, it's also, no, because adrenaline is epinephrine. Okay. So nor epinephrin that it makes you feel so good. It's like one of the reasons why I really liked going to the cryo chamber just to get out, get out. Yeah. You get out, you're like, whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       Putting your body under stress and then it releases that Doctor Rhonda Patrick is also a big proponent of that in the sauna. And that's why I installed that sauna here. Call it a protein. Yeah. Heat shock proteins. He chocked proteins and cold shock proteins. So proteins that are produced by your body to deal with the effects of extreme heat or cold. See your body reacts to stress. Too much heat will kill you for sure. Too much cold will kill you for sure. But a little bit is actually very good for you because your body has a response to that and that response sort of invigorates your entire system, kind of speaks to what you're talking about performing and a ceiling stressing yourself going through that stress in order to, um, yeah, I listened to a chunk of that ell and um, Joey Diaz. Yeah. Which by the way, it was amazing the way you guys communicate it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:05       That was like, it's pretty cool. Uh, but the, yeah, the, the pyramid of athletics. Yeah. Every day. And you're living there. It just made me think about my own life, which you know, my parents really hard to like make me comfortable and here's your TV and you go to school and you come home from school and how that's the goal in like suburban life is to just be coffee counter ball. We don't realize it, but this is all because people before us weren't we just only living in the environment where people are supposed to be comfortable, but you know, just two generations back, everyone's an immigrant and everyone's really concerned about starving, so I have to do, go back to the 1920s everyone's worried about fucking dying. There were millions of people died. Like even during World War Two millions of people died by starvation. That was a real concern.

Speaker 2:          01:05:54       I remember you saying to him, you're like, yeah, it produced, it produces really good athletes. It might not be like the nicest situation, but there's no way you get really nice situations that produced the world's best combat sports athletes just doesn't happen. You have to be strong as fuck mentally, physically. You have to have experienced adversity on a level that most people can never comprehend so that when the shit hits the fan that you could look at the other guy on the other side of the cage like Yoel Romero does and goes, I'm going to go fuck you up cause I've been through everything already. Even then the other guys the same way so he doesn't even work. Yeah, I don't really relate to that. Like China fuck up the other dude and going through so much adversity. Well I, well I'm, my point of view is like, I'm going to do my chores and I'm so comfortable right now.

Speaker 2:          01:06:44       Now I'm going to deliberately make myself uncomfortable in order to do what I know is good for me and that I enjoy doing and that I want to have success in. And that takes me to another place in my life. But it's, you know, I do it in a very small way. You know, you do, but it's still really honestly the same thing. What [inaudible] is doing and what you're doing is the same thing. You're doing something very difficult that you, it's, you struggle to do it. It's hard. You push yourself visit [inaudible] want to do it and in through doing it you get a little bit better at everything. Did he talk about, I only watched the first chunk of it. Uh, did he talk about his desire to do that or not? Yeah. Like yeah. Yeah, he dead. And how does that, how does that match with kind of being put in that system?

Speaker 2:          01:07:31       I think you asked that early on too was like how do they choose, how do you choose? Is it just want someone who has what? If you have the natural ability but you don't want to do it, well then you won't perform. And if you don't perform, you get knocked out of the system. There is the desire. It does, it has to be to be as good as he is. There has to be desire to compete. He wanted to be a boxer initially said, but his father was a boxer. I think his brother is a world champion boxer as well. He's just a genetic for reek. Like there's genetics and Cuba, and he was explaining it to me too. He's during the podcast, he was like, anybody that thinks that everyone's on steroids just go to Cuba where everybody is so poor and look at the regular people, just the regular people.

Speaker 2:          01:08:10       Forget about the athletes. He said, I'll take you to Cuba for two weeks and you'll come back. You're like, I get it. I get it. There's just really, it was a slave colony. They, they had a hard life. I mean it's, it's, that's their Africans that speaks Spanish and they live on an island that's off the coast of Florida. I mean, it's a crazy spot. The whole thing is crazy. It was run by a dictator forever and they had some of the best athletes in the world in boxing, in judo and wrestling, just world class athletes that had mental toughness. The likes of, I mean it's hard for the average person even comprehend with those people are capable of, and a lot of it is because of that really brutal system that you all talked about on the podcast. Amazing stuff. Amazing. You know, just, just imagining that this guy went through that, you know, it's fascinating because that's not what I want to do.

Speaker 2:          01:08:58       It's not what you want to do, right. But you just think like that there's a person out there that can do that. And look what happens on the other end. You get that guy like Jesus. He was just being in the room with him. It's just, he's like a fucking superhero. It's like cheese us that, that is the product of genetics, ruthless training, ruthless environment. You know, one of the most complex and sophisticated sports training systems in the world with boxing and with wrestling and with Judah. I mean they're just phenomenal over there. It was cool. It was really inspiring. It's amazing for way for someone like me, like I don't relate necessarily to what he does is like foreign and amazing. But through my own life it's like, oh, I can be not comfortable. And that's why it seems like a contradiction, but it's not like that's what we're supposed to be doing.

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       Um, and when you get through that you have a sense of satisfaction and then it feels bad. It wasn't something that was introduced to me or taught to me really. I mean, I did sports a little bit. Did you figure it out just through the pursuit? Yeah, I don't, there was nothing that I really committed to that much or knew how to, or if I did it was maybe one small aspect. It wasn't really a thing. It was, you know, the messaging was try to get by and try to try to get some shitty job, you know, it wasn't, um, it's weird because you know, at the not, not like woe is me, but like just knowing the, even that you had choices that you could try to beat something great. That wasn't really something that was discussed or on the table. Well wasn't that does not, that's one aspect of all comedy.

Speaker 2:          01:10:49       Like they're not a lot of people that talk about success or the process of, it's more of like playing everything low key. Right. Or like a sarcasm or a, it's not like that's the sincerity. Yes, yes, yes. Of being a hipster is that you've got that distance. You're not really, that's why I love the comedy store as well because it's like the opposite. It's the opposite. It's like what's your thing? And every been super honest and open about like bombings and good sets and bad sets and jokes had just fell right in their face like that back bar area. So brutal with the people who just come back there and go, oh, I just ate a fat, played a shit. Like people are just so honest about it when they come downstairs, you know, it's great place. I feel super fortunate in it. Yeah, I missed it so much coming back.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       I mean there's a place for that. Sarcasm and the, and the, sure Thomson [inaudible] does that all the time, but he's also sincere as well. Yeah, there's a, there's a thing that's a, it's an insecurity. Um, it's like a defense mechanism and that's what a lot of people do it for. They pretend they're above it all, but no one's above it all, man. You can't, don't pretend you're above it all. It's ridiculous. You can do it for fun. But pretending you're actually above it all you're missing out like nobody believes you. First of all, it's like pretending you're psychic. Are you ho? You know magic. Nobody fucking believes you. All right, so you keep down, act going, keep your fucking fake mustache on your Cape and your top hat. I feel that's like, that's silly. Like it's doing it occasionally. Every now and then it's fun. We all do it to each other all the time, but if you have a complete lack of ability to communicate sincerely, that's not being hip or cool, right? That's a defense mechanism and it's a stupid one because you don't have much time. You have a hundred years. If you're lucky, they'll go, they go by like that. If you have $100 you spend a dollar a day before you know what? You're fucking broke. That's life.

Speaker 3:          01:12:43       My son was like, where did Michael, how old was Michael Jackson when he died? I was like, ah. In his fifties he was like, oh, okay. Like that. Like that sounded right to him. I'm like, ah. People don't die until much,

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       basically. That's me. Well, Michael Jackson's a craziest case of all time, right. Cause he was giving him, they was in administering anesthesia every night so we can go to sleep. Dude, I was playing that. I was playing a want to be starting something and uh,

Speaker 3:          01:13:11       thriller in the car on the way, taking my son to school and I start crying just because it's like, how do you explain

Speaker 2:          01:13:20       what he was and how monumental,

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       what he did was like, I can remember seeing him dancing the Billie Jean and like how kind of like broke the mold for music and the persona that he had and that level of creativity.

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       Um, yeah, it was weird to be in the car with us, with my kid who doesn't really know the name but didn't, you know? Right. It's just, that's not part of his life. That's not part of his life. Maybe she introduced him to that movie, that documentary. Was that the one documentary that did this is it? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Does that get into the drugs and stuff? And how many years was he doing it for? So, so sad. Not Very Long, but here's one of the more fucked up things is, this is something I speculated a long time ago. His doctor who went to jail for giving him the anesthesia also testified that Michael Jackson was chemically castrated by his parents when he was young to preserve his voice. That's what I suspected. I suspect that I talked about on the podcast like years ago, I was saying this, that I think he was a cast Strada, which is they take young boys and they used to do this with opera and they would castrate them at a very young age and because of that their body never developed testosterone.

Speaker 2:          01:14:37       So they would do at this high piercing like haunting voice. It's very strange. Like we played some of the, there's only a few recordings of actual castrol does that are available or cas, stratos, one of those. Um, but the, when you play them they're haunting cause you realize like this is a kid that was castrated as a baby so that it can be a singer. Like this is fucked up. And that's what Michael Jackson's doctor said they did to Michael. They did it through chemicals. They chemically castrated him the same way as judy pedophile. I'm just trying to regulate a situation that was already far gone. Is that his, uh, defense? No, I mean there's no defense. The doctors just fucking, you know, he's just killed me. It killed Michael Jackson, let them get anesthesia until he died. His defense wasn't that he was just saying there's something else, right.

Speaker 2:          01:15:28       Like Michael Jackson was fucked up. Like his parents literally chemically castrated him to preserve his voice because he was the lead singer of the Jackson five when he was a baby. And that was part of what was great about him was like, oh baby one not chance. Like that voice, that voice was nothing like anything that he would be capable of doing as an adult. If he grew into a man, he would have this big old man, I want to get some pussy voice. And he was like, no, where's the little Michael? He would have like a, you know, like, um, a barry white voice or something like, fuck, you can't have that. Like you're Michael, you know, your ABC, it's easy as well. He may not have gotten that deep, but this voice, but the guests, if you get that, that's the belief. Be believed that he'd never had the chance. I believe it. You know, I believe it cause his voice didn't sound anything like a regular mans and it didn't sound anything like his brothers, his brothers all look like regular grown ass men. Michael Jackson's deep voice. That's not deep. So that's fine.

Speaker 5:          01:16:34       Cold.

Speaker 2:          01:16:37       That sounds like John Rivers. It rangy I was looking it up. All those places, I'm seeing that story about him being castrated or like tabloid eats the sun and that kind of stuff. Right. But it was, wasn't an an interview in like, uh, the, which was a UK paper and I just grew, it was the sun, which is like not the best, not the worst. Right. The Daily Mail is the worst. But both of them actually I did the same. The equal. I don't think so. I'm hoping that's so true. And the last time you talked about this, I got some messages. I don't know. Again, like what's getting videos like this of showing like examples, his deep talking voice that's not deep. There's a lot of chicks that have weighed deeper voices. Yeah. Listen, that's his deep voice. Come on, let me tell you. You mother Fucker, you listened to the wrong people.

Speaker 2:          01:17:26       I mean think of how many women have ruthlessly deep voices. Yeah. All right. I can tell you a couple of right now. Yeah. I think, I think they did it to him. His voice was just phenomenal acumen nature. Like as an adult, that is such a fucking phenomenal song. It doesn't sound like anything that irregular man is capable of saying like the notes that he hits, like that voice that he had was just haunting. Right. Trying to think of who else is a natural, uh, star who has a high boy hold. He used to sing in Falsetto, but it was very obvious when he was doing it that he was doing it. Yes. Whereas Michael Jackson like that human nature songs, one of my favorites because it's such a, like a slow, smooth holding of those sounds. These are natural sounds that are coming from, you know, it's like this natural, like a warm affectionate tone to it. It just doesn't seem like a man's voice. It doesn't seem like a woman's voice either. That's my point.

Speaker 6:          01:18:27       You kept the wrap way talk and that's different. That's like falsetto. Are you saying that's like a four? Sounds like a caricature. Yeah, you could say that it's in that way. What does this feel like? Dancing. Whoo.

Speaker 2:          01:18:40       Puberty. Phoneokay yeah. Known as Ma mutational false. I had a call on my penis. It's a type of voice disorder characterized by habitual use of high pitched voice after puberty. Oh, so that some people get that. Yeah. It's like a psych psychogenic in nature. So the other thing is you look at his body, he had no muscle like his body was like, I mean he was a very active guy dancing all the time, but it wasn't billing a dancer. He was billing a stick. You know, it was a very, very thin guy. That's what you would expect from someone who didn't have any testosterone. You wouldn't be able to develop any muscle. I'm sticking with my theory. I might have biases, but they're mine. They're mine. Okay. I'm sticking with it. Dig 'em up. Dig Him up and check the nuts. Degas mop. Summerlin. Yes. Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Anything cause report to in this day and age? Geez, you just turn it over to me. I was just trying to figure out where you stand on.

Speaker 1:          01:19:38       Thanks. Um, what, what uh,

Speaker 2:          01:19:43       Whoa, whoa. Um, told you I cried to Michael Jackson. Yeah. Good reason.

Speaker 1:          01:19:50       Uh, I

Speaker 2:          01:19:54       think I'm a hypocrite. In what way? The gun control, um, March that is happening. I, part of me was like,

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       I had a friend, a mom who said they're the, the march is going on right outside our house, like who wants to join? And as soon as I clicked on the email and saw what it was in the pit of my stomach, I was like, no, no. And then I covered it up with, I should do that. This would be a really good thing to do. And I was then fighting with myself because I was like, well, you can't have both things at once. Either you want to March and do that or you don't like, those are conflicting things.

Speaker 7:          01:20:51       MMM.

Speaker 3:          01:20:52       I don't want to do it. I don't think it'll help. But then there's another part of me that really likes when people march, because I do think it changes the attitude. Like I'm really happy that the women's March happened and is happening, but I didn't go and I feel like it's like a dirty secret and I've started to, I have a bit about it. That's sort of an unformed bit where I say, yeah, I live in Encino because that's where you go to give up. Like next, next time you see me, I'm going to be like, I live in thousand oaks, I'm allergic to the sun. And I, and I described like the moment I knew I had given up was, and this is just an exploratory, I still don't have it figured out. The mom and I knew I had given up was I was making my stairway from my vagina poster with glitter and then I marched out to the curb and was like, it's too hot. Right. I don't think there'll be parking at the march. And went back inside. Did you really? Yeah. I mean that's the joke version, but I was very conflicted and like, oh, I should go. And both times I was doing stuff with my kid and it was, you know, a very small, mundane day. And I was like, I'm not doing it. And then I saw the women that did it and they talked about being in this crowd and how uplifting it was. And I was like, that's amazing. Like I'm really happy this is happening,

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       but yet why is it because I don't care and I'm weak? Or is it because I, there's a part of me that believes it's, I, I don't want to do it and that it's an actual belief. And then I was like, you're a hypocrite. And then I was like, I'm tired. You can't think about it anymore. But yeah, the, uh, I don't know. I think what I'm saying, I'm a hypocrite is what I'm saying. I don't know if you're a hypocrite, you just have you decided when they knock over, I just decide what you want to do and what you don't want to do. You know, and you didn't want him to go Marsha Day. It doesn't mean you're a hypocrite. It means you just didn't want to do it. You're a hypocrite.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       If you were saying one thing and voting for another, that would make you a hypocrite. That just makes you a person. You're just just decided that's not what you wanted to do and also look, it is. It would be nice if you through your one and two, the 600,000 that were marching through the streets of downtown La, but there's still 600,000 people. Even if she just watching it from the news and go, you go girl, it's not, you're not helping, you're not helping, but I don't think you're a hypocrite. It doesn't make you a hypocrite.

Speaker 2:          01:23:34       Does it help? Do you think those big marches, and I'm wondering, I think it empowers people. It gets people very excited about the cause. There's a lot of other people that think like minded, gets people to watch, gets people to put it on the news. People at home watch it. Maybe people feel like, hey, even though some fucked up things have gone down with Harvey Weinstein and all this other shit, it least it's turning around. Maybe people are bummed out that this guy became the president, but now people are active. Maybe people are paying attention more, maybe people are more engaged. So ultimately it's almost like we were talking about before. You get past that adversity and there's actually a benefit to it. And sometimes I think even as a country we might need that cause we don't have any war over here. Everything is over there.

Speaker 2:          01:24:17       We don't see it in terms of like right in front of us on a daily basis. But this is like a cultural war and an idea of war. And so I think that these things happening right in front of us and having these uncomfortable moments forces these conversations is just going to be peaks and valleys in the conversation where people are rude and people are calm and maybe there's going to be some breakthroughs, but ultimately it at least four and probably, well, I'm pro progress. And I think that all of this comes from people being disfat dissatisfied with how things are currently. So the best way to, to add, to very, very inspiring to me that you know, that there's kids came out and our talking and that's like, I love that about guns. It's also sad that sa so, so little is happening. Yeah, there's, there's, it is sad, but there's two things that have to be addressed.

Speaker 2:          01:25:09       Guns have to be addressed for sure, but also mental health has to be a trust. We have to address psych medicines. We have to address how many of these people, whether it's correlation equals causation or not. How many of these fucking people have been on psych medicine? And the answer is almost all of them. Now, does that mean that they're, they're mentally ill and so that's why they shoot people or that doing the psych meds, a lot of people call these the effects of these things very disassociative that they allow people to do horrific things they might not have been able to do before or inspire them to do that. There's a real argument there. It's not exonerating the people that have done these horrific things or exonerating the people that got the guns in their hands, it's not doing that, but it is a factor.

Speaker 2:          01:25:49       There's a fact that the people aren't taken into consideration becomes, it comes, it becomes a one or the other thing. It becomes an either we need more gun control and we need stricter gun control or we need to do something about the effects of psych medication. It's not both and I think it's both. I really did say, well, yeah, based on how you just presented it, it definitely seems like both and it, there was an article, there was, or I'm sorry to interrupt you, but there was an article that was written, I got to remember this. There was written recently that was really ridiculous and it would say, and contrary to popular belief, most of these mass shooters are not mentally ill. Well what the fuck defines mentally ill if they're on psych medication, they're all on anti psychotics and psychiatric meds and Ssri. They're almost all so if they not, they're not mentally ill.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       How are you shooting people? And that in itself, that was the next [inaudible] you can just go and do a school and shoot 19 children. You have to be mentally ill. But the point is if they're not mentally ill, why are they taking medicine for people who are mentally ill? There's a bullshit article and it's an article or who knows what the fucking, whether it's a contrarian point of view that's is designed to get clickbait hits or whether it's someone who is trying to set up a narrative that's contrary to what the pharmaceutical drugs companies have known for years. There's real effects to those things. I can, and they're not always positive and it's a God crap crapshoot. Whether or not a pill's going to work for you or not work for you. I mean that that's why they have abilify. Abilify is an anti psychotic.

Speaker 2:          01:27:21       They prescribed to people who are on, they're on Ssri but they think about killing themselves. They're like, well if you're thinking about killing yourself, try this first. Try to stack these two together. Maybe that's your mixture. And Ryan wasn't it the most number one most prescribed drug in the country. See if that's true. Still a bill of an antipsychotic was the number one most prescribed drug in the country. Look, we've got a fucking problem now how many of these people are taking medication cause they really need it. I'm sure if some of them, how many people are taking medication because drug companies are pushing this shit. I bill fise top selling us drug. There you go. That's fucking crazy. The top selling us drug. See this. Don't blame mental illness. Blame men. Well that's true too. No, she's right there to the guy. Have a bit that I'm doing about all the different fucked up things that men do.

Speaker 2:          01:28:09       Like it's an anti men's rights bit and it's like that Ma, I don't want to do it on the air cause they'll fuck it up for before my special. But it's that we have to pay attention to like all the shit that we do wrong. Like men, like when we look like mass mass shootings is not just one. If you want to take credit for the good things and men have done, you have to take credit for all the war. Like that's also what they'd done. Men have cause all of it, you know. And in the bit I go into detail about all these different things, it's, it's a build up to something else. But this, this also has to be addressed that it's always men. That's real too. It's not not blaming every man that didn't shoot up a school. We have to figure out what the fuck is it, what is it?

Speaker 2:          01:28:49       What combination of psych, drugs, guns and being a man is causing this. And if we just want to blame only the tools, that seems to be to be fucking crazy. They also want to blame the NRA. Well, I'd see him one point because you think the NRA is helping people get drunk or get guns rather more easily. I get that. But also no one who was a member of the NRA has ever committed a mass shooting. So you have to think of that. Well, well what does that mean? I mean, are you really blaming the group of people that want gun safety to be paramount and the group of people that doesn't want their rights to be infringed? Or are you going to attack the group of people that are actually shooting these people? That's the real problem is that people that have actually done it, and I guarantee you there's something wrong with every single for that.

Speaker 3:          01:29:33       Yeah, they're right about now. Sorry. No, no, no it because everything you're saying, I'm just thinking that the person that shoots a bunch of people, whether they're on psych drugs, whether they have access to a gun, mental health issues there, they're isolated to the point where they can do something like that. Yeah. And that quiet little statement that someone is isolated is something that we can't address because it's so complicated. And it's such the fabric of how we live our lives. It's so much easier to like blame and fight for all these things, but how do we fix, you know the one guy who his brother was just found with all that porn. It's like, yeah, the guy that shot all the people in Vegas. Yeah. How do we address just how fucked up people are in general or the contraband story about I'm jumping topics, but the horrible story about that, can't even talk about it. The couple that had all those kids that they open their basement, nobody knew. Nobody said anything. People. Yeah, I thought they seemed weird, like how do we address our disconnection from each other that we that were so fun.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       There is, you're definitely going to be people that feel alienated and they always want to, they see these people having a good time around them and they want to just flip over the game. They want to say fuck you and burn the whole thing to the ground. There's always going to be people like that. There's a lot of that that you can see people having a good time around and see people that are happy that, that are enjoying life. Like especially if this kid felt alienated in school and bullied and cast out and targeted and then he gets free and he sees these people that are having fun. He just wants to go back and just punish everyone. This is a very common theme, you know, people, how do we pain that theme? How do we help people who are in pain? We are going to have to do a lot of things right?

Speaker 2:          01:31:42       Because like, think of the people that uh, had their children locked up. Who are these monsters and how'd they have a kid? How was it so hard to get a car license? It's, and it's easy as fuck to have a kid and raise another member of our culture, of our society, our community. How's that possible? You've, you've introduced a poison and toxic member to our community cause you did a terrible job of raising them. And one of the oldest ones, I went to college and then they would, I can't remember. I think it was a dude would come out and the mom would be waiting for him and like, so the oldest one was out in the world and still no one could help. Like whatever, mind mallards they had, this one was out and he didn't say that his younger brothers and sisters were locked up. I had gas. Oh God, he should be in jail. Yeah. I don't know the whole, the details of that. I mean it's, I guess it's not his fault. He's probably what? Beyond fucked in the head, but just the fact that he could keep that a secret. It's like what?

Speaker 2:          01:32:43       It's horrific and you and you just think about, I mean, how many people are fucked by the time they have children? Like it's not even that they're doing a bad job of it. They're incapable of doing a good job of it there too fucked up there, too fucked up from their own upbringing. But they still get horny. I mean, does this as is what happens in this world? People like to have sex. They have saks boone, there's a person got a raise it, but I'm fucked up and I love math. What do you do in men? Mra? Yeah, it's fucking men. It's everybody. It's definitely men though and that's, that's my issue with all this. A masculine bullshit is a lot of these guys that are proclaiming masculinity or really bitches and that the, that real men wouldn't be doing this stuff in the first place. You would look past most of this stuff in the first place.

Speaker 4:          01:33:39       You know,

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       there's a lot of people in this world that don't have personal sovereignty, whether it's men or women and they're not, they're not raised correctly and then they didn't go on a beneficial path through life that left them in the current state, whether they're a helpful member of our community. That's the show about family values. That's what you're really about. It is about community values, life, friendship. You know like what we were talking about, the comedy store, friendships giant. It's very important and some people don't have any fucking friends and that's a dark place to be bullied. You're whole life. Don't have any friends. You're on medication, you're all fucked up and you're one of those guys out there that just wants to go out with a bang, you know, just want to walk into a mall with a fucking shotgun and go out with a bang.

Speaker 2:          01:34:23       There's a lot of people that think like that. They just don't have the courage to do it. I mean, even going back to that one night that we, when I said I don't know if I can do it, I mean it's a smaller example, but, but still valid, you know, and you just looked at me and said, you can your guide, like you're doing it or you know, whatever you're responsible as those little moments of like, those are big, a real connection. Yeah. When you know someone really does care about you and someone who really does like you and we're not, you know, talking every day. It was just a moment of and commonality

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       and seeing that other person, we fixed it, everybody and we fixed it. We did it well. I never had

Speaker 2:          01:35:05       never knew that you didn't think well of me or, or I did.

Speaker 3:          01:35:09       Yeah. I never felt like he didn't like him sedated by you and I didn't I, well I didn't know you, but I just like your vibe to me was like, oh, like he doesn't like me very much. But that wasn't because of anything years ago though, this is probably would have been 2000 whatever. Right, right. But it was never anything where like I didn't like you. I'm sure I probably was not even really on your radar or not even a thing. I'm not liking or liking that. I know we never really had any interactions. No, I just felt your power took it first. Personally. I felt your power.

Speaker 2:          01:35:49       That's pretty silly. Well we got through that too. Yeah, we did. So if you do a special, yeah. When you think you'd be gearing up for that, have you thought through it? Like to be ready in a year? We were ready in a month. Oh my gosh. Too much.

Speaker 3:          01:36:06       No, it was the bed. Or has that been mad? Um, nap, nap. I have to figure out, cause so many comics I know do it themselves. Yeah. I think I could have the material I want fairly like within the next six months, but then I need to figure out the how, the, how

Speaker 2:          01:36:31       the, how. There's a few companies that do you need to make, I need to make it first. Right? That's how you do it. Yeah. Just make it, yeah, that's not a bad move. The just making it first is not a bad mood because when you just make it first, then you could just sort of sell it somewhere. And if it's good, everybody is always looking for new comedy. You know, there's, we were just talking earlier about the Amazon. I heard a

Speaker 3:          01:36:55       little bit of scare because I had teed up for it when I first went on the road and had had an hour. And then, um, my manager at the time, I think tried to sell it on a high level. This was before Netflix is what it is now. It was a few years back when they were first started doing hours, I think. Um, and they were like, no. And then she, you know, all, all the top tier people were like, no. Like, no one knows her as a comic, like we're not buying it. And then she was like, let me sell it at the second tier. And they're like, no. And then this whole time I was like, you should have just done it myself. But I think I've been lucky enough to have get a lot of acting jobs. So whenever I'm like being myself starter and then a carrot comes along, I'm like, Oh, do that acting job. That'll work. So, so I've never had to sort of grind it out in that way. And that's why it scares me. So then at the, when it didn't sell at that time I just went, oh, I should have done that myself and now I'm tired of this material. And then, you know, time passes. I'm like, maybe it's

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       for the best because you know, once I do that, then I'm really out there as that. It might be a commitment issue on my part. I know that film. I know what you mean. It's just hard. It's hard to just fucking dig your heels in, decide to do something that's tough like that. And then also the financial investment if you decide to do it yourself. Yeah. Like you got to spend a lot of money and hire crude. Make sure the director doesn't fuck it up and make sure it all comes out well. You know who do I know the did one and they fucked up the shooting of it and he had a wind up putting it online. Was it rory Albany's did. He said that he did one that someone fucked up and he wound up putting it online or he hasn't released his, yeah, he was thinking about doing it soon sound my throws him somebody else then Kurt Metzger.

Speaker 4:          01:38:43       Hm.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       Whatever. Yeah, someone funny. Did you do yours yourself? I did one of them myself. Yeah, I've done two of them. Two of them myself. Yeah. Um, but the best was last year doing it with Netflix. That was the best because they're just so easy. They just like, go ahead. They used to let you do it. They're like, we like it. Yay. That's awesome. There was zero feedback, you know, they just wanted to make sure it was an hour long. Not too long. Not too short. I kind of want to do a 15 minute special cause I have this thing that I've done for years and I don't do it every very often, but it's a in a throw down. It's like, hey guys, take a hey guys, take a break. Hey ladies, fucking guys. Am I right ladies? Take a break. What's up with these bitches? But like 15 minutes like bitches and they're scented candles.

Speaker 2:          01:39:34       They're always like, smell this, try these sheets. Uh Guys, take a break. Ladies, give us a ring if you want to be that. That's funny. I like it. 15 minutes. So that's just something they're doing now, right? That's what I heard. Yeah. No, I'd love to do an hour for sure. But that's more of a commitment to things and ideas that you wanted to have some girth to. Well, you could definitely do it, but we were also talking about how Amazon's doing specials now too. They did Bob Saget special and they ere, they bought a bunch of other people specials that they bought. Brian counts special, they bought all those specialists. And so all those specials are now on Amazon. A lot of places for you that's pretty swollen. Just do it is what you're saying. Sure. Yeah. The only terrifying thing is once you do it then you have to write new material. That's where it gets scary because then you're doing, you're left without weapons. He started from scratch and you've got to grind and dig, claw your way back up to the top of the hill.

Speaker 4:          01:40:36       Oh okay.

Speaker 2:          01:40:40       He never done that before. Huh? Especial. Most special when you have to abandon all the materials and start from scratch. Now as you were saying that, I was thinking, cause I've done one woman shows I've done but I'm still pulling from like that show cause it's, you know, if it's

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       stuff that I still like I'll pull it up. I have stuff about, you know, my son being an infant and he's nine years old. I still talking about my csection if it's late at the comedy store, I'm like let's get into it cause I know they don't want to hear it. I'm like let me, let's talk about it. It's 1:00 AM with second with a c section. Those are strength training. That's like running with weights on like a weight vest, weights on your back and like a ankle weights too. I've learned to really love him. It took me so long to just even leave the house. I would, I would be standing there at the comedy store. Like I had to train myself to be like, no, this is part of it. You have to be awake, you have to want to be here. Yeah. It was a weird psychological, cause I'm part of me is like just want to do my set, but then I'm like resenting that I'm out of the house.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       Like I come some sort of princess or something. How dare. It's like, no, you made this choice. You want it. But connecting the want with what it is. I don't know. I mean I've talked to other people who are like, oh, like, well don't do midnight shows, you know. But, but clearly I wanted it and I wanted it at the comedy store and once I got used to it, I was like, this is the best. Like, I love doing those late spots. Not that I wouldn't mind an 8:00 PM shot, shot, shot, shot, and my slot.

Speaker 1:          01:42:26       Nitrile it makes you talk and I'm only, I didn't even get halfway through. I'm taking it easy. Well then you were about 135 milligrams caffeine and it's good. It's not bad. Right. And it's really good. Espresso. Do you drink that kind of stuff? Yes. Black coffee. Yeah. I'll go. I go both ways. Wrong. I like a latte. I like a latte. Vanilla sweetener and shit. No, not sure. No, no, no. Like a straight up nonfat. I'll do it all. I'll drink a vanilla latte. I won't turn my nose at it. I'll do a shot of a sham. So yeah, it's all yummy. Yeah. You're um, you're kind of on a path of self improvement through comedy. Do you realize that? I like that because it seems like it, right? Yeah. Like if you seem like a more empowered by this I, I definitely am. Yeah, that's true, isn't it? It is. It is. It's, it's helping me. He said so reluctantly. So decision, a strange thing. Well, it's what it is, is you're fighting your alt roots. So it is, you're fighting the smugness and the sarcasm. You're fighting it. Fighting sincerity. Like Saturday self improvement coach, is that what I'm doing? Sure. I'm like, ah, if I could just get on a pilot that I back to

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       work anymore. No commitment. This is a zone out. You're not even there. You know? And he like, you do your best, but Simon, you're writing whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:44:01       So what's easier, so much easier for no good sitcoms. Dropping some logic. When I was on news radio when it was trading on a pilot, so about yeah, go on. When it was smooth, so easy to show up script. Good. Got a couple good lines. Remember him, deliver him, sit in the makeup chair puts what's wrong with that? Boom. Nothing wrong with someone's bringing you a drink. It doesn't feel as good. It's not as good problems. You already killed Mary Lynn. You've already crossed over into the dark lands. Ah, okay. When you kill like Saturday night on the road and you're fucking crushing, right? When you put it all together and you remember those dark days and you first started doing it again, now you're killing. Yeah. How good's that feel?

Speaker 3:          01:44:46       It feels great. It's amazing. But then I will it all chip away. Like, how long will I let that feel great? You know,

Speaker 2:          01:44:53       maybe double the next morning and then, uh, then it starts all over again and then you got to do it again. Yeah. Yeah. I have to. That's how, that's the thing. There's never a point where like, oh, I made it. Let me sit down. There's no, that doesn't, that place doesn't exist.

Speaker 7:          01:45:09       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:45:09       Well, he always have the bed, Delaware, you can always take those down. Is there, you can always enjoy those naps. Ah, a pillow is always there. He got now with all your shots, the cat can crawl in bed with you. No problem.

Speaker 7:          01:45:27       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:45:27       I mean, I still have a lot of fear with even last night we, how was your, uh, your standup on the spot? It was great. I loved it so much. I spent the entire day going, why did I do this? I'm not clever enough. Like I can't think of jokes. I'm like, just say the opposite. Just get angry. Go on around like I'm coming up with all devices because I'm like, you won't, you won't write a joke on the spot. You don't know how to write. Your brain doesn't work like that. Oh, like a crazy person. A nightmare. A living nightmare. I spent the day going, Oh really? Oh, you're going to just come up with Joe because on the spot, like good luck with that. The voice in my head, once I got there, it was delightful. It was like, oh, this is my real life. This isn't the life in my head. Yeah. It was a delight. Yeah. I had to call my friend afterwards and go, I think I just experienced pleasure. I hate to say this, but that was

Speaker 2:          01:46:23       shareable. Well, that room in particular that that set for people don't stand up on the spot. As Jeremiah Watkins show, he used to have a show called Thunderpussy I guess. Oh really? Yeah. That was the same show, but they called it thunderpussy for some reason. Uh, now, um, what you do is you go on stage and uh, people just have suggestions like I met, I make people put their hands up, I point to someone and then they give you a suggestion and right away you just start talking about it. And I have some real potential leads for bits from last night, like two solid ones where I, what I do is I don't want to, but I do when I get home, I'm fucking tired. I've had a long day, but it's still sit in front of the computer and I play the recordings and I go back. I have to have to, it's part of the job.

Speaker 2:          01:47:09       Have to clean your room. It's like those things like got to brush your teeth. I don't want him to go to sleep pressure. Fucking teeth got to do it. And so I'm sure this is fairly normal. How many sets I have in my phone that I've never listened to. Yeah, it's really normal. Um, I listened to the mall. You have to, that's the only time. I don't listen to the malls when I'm on the road, I'm doing four sets. Erase it after. No, you save it. I'll show you. I got all these bitches in here and you've listened to all of them and they stay there. Look at them all. How do you know which one to go back to for stuff? I don't really mark them. I edit the name. See at the bottom. That's good. Yeah. But then you won't know how do you remember which bit in this one?

Speaker 2:          01:47:53       You just kind of just record it and I go over it with a notebook. But the thing with me as the big thing is, um, I know when something happened, like if I do a sat and I'm like okay, I went on a totally different chain of thought. Yes. And this, if this branch of the bit might be a new bit, I have to listen to that bit again. And so I'll clearly go over there and make sure that your common sense, but it's so hard to do. Yeah. You're giving me the training right now of this stuff that's like, obviously you remember when you went off on that thing, go back and listen to it and write it down. Think about the things that you've said today that have helped you, right? Like how you've had to speak clearly, do all these things and what did that come from?

Speaker 2:          01:48:34       Well that come from, that comes from trial and error and focus like you're focusing on your act because of that. That next level of focusing on your act is being like super diligent about recordings and writing and that's what a lot of comics don't do it. There's a lot of comics that think they're grinding and they'll say that I'm out there, I'm doing a lot of sets. They're not writing any new material though. You can't. You have to write. You have to actually write. That's what I believe. Maybe maybe you can just write all on stage because you can trick yourself into thinking that you're grinding it out and maybe you are doing a lot of sets and maybe doing the same set. You're doing it differently so you can and that's it. That's fine. That's its own thing. But you're not going to come up with new staff from that.

Speaker 2:          01:49:16       You're doing something, but are you doing like everything you could be doing? It's like it's like anything else. The more time and enthusiasm you put on something, the better you're going to get at it. If you're a guy like save your bowler and you only like the bowl 40 minutes a day, but you want to be the best in the world, turn not gunna be, I don't care what you want, but the time and enthusiasm is that tricky part that goes back to like discipline. Well also I was trying to make a bigger jump, which is how do you connect to being enthusiastic? If you don't, we'll think about how you were bummed out about your set, right? And you got to the store and you had a trick your brain into being more present and more pumped up for your set. Right. And then when you did it was a joy.

Speaker 2:          01:50:05       I guess I'm trying to connect it to what we were talking about earlier about people who get isolated and don't have friends and don't have a feedback and don't have those like tendrils of like being able to make that leap so that, you know, you start like eating yourself alive and well, I think with everything, it's like a little stuff climb out of the barrel, right? If you're 300 pounds, do not run a marathon, right? Walk around the block. And if you're a person who's been living your life with a bunch of fucking negative thinking in your head, take steps in the right direction, you know, take a step back and you have to acknowledge that step today. I mean, I remember that. I need to remember it and I need to build on that, you know? And you can do that. Anybody can do that.

Speaker 2:          01:50:51       You could just do it incrementally. I had a great podcast with this guy, David Goggins. Did you ever heard of him? So, um, he's a navy seal who's also a famous tech podcast, but yes, yes. I heard a bit of that. And he was talking about how, you know, he was a fat loser who kept making excuses for himself and just like drinking chocolate milkshakes every day working for an exterminator and he was fat as fuck. And they just decided I don't want to do this any more. And he had these moments where he went, he went running, he ran three quarters of a mile, then he turned around and walked back home. That was his first time running. Like it wasn't quick that it became, this guy runs a hundred miles at a time and he was doing, how many fucking a hundred milers did he do in a year?

Speaker 2:          01:51:33       Wasn't it crazy every week or every other week or every month? It was insane because when he played it for, he showed us the website and he was like, these are all the ones he did in a year. And it's like, what the fuck? Like every week or two weeks he was running a hundred miles like in the mountains and shit. A hundred that's a 24 hour race. Yeah. And he was doing it every week. That's fucking insane. But this guy started out running three quarters of a mile and then he quit and turned around and walk back home cause he was fat and he's eating milkshakes every day. Like that's the same guy he be. He with these little incremental steps and then just deciding this is who I am now. I'm a guy who does what I say I'm supposed to do and I'm fucking serious. I'm going to change my life. I always shredded just guys a fucking animal. I mean he's just a pure a machine made out of like motivation and discipline. Like you don't get more disciplined than I am now, but he wasn't at one point in time in his life and by him expressing that on the podcast and it's really inspirational podcasts. I think it gives everybody hope cause you like to think that, oh that guy who is really good at this thing or that guy was really mentally tough or this girl who's super disciplined who just get accomplishes thing

Speaker 3:          01:52:45       after thing. She's always been like that, don't, no, no, no, no. She's, nobody's always had been like that. No one has you. You start off fucking up, you fail, you move up, you figure it out, you make some mistakes, you fall back, you get back up, you go, well, that's not me. I'm me now. I realized, don't do that anymore. Now instead, don't quit after three quarters of a mile. Now we're going to drink water instead of drinking chocolate shakes, we're going to eat healthy food and tomorrow we're going to do a whole fucking mile. Let's do it. And then you do that mine like, Holy Shit, I did it. Mark it down, write it down, did a mile, and then maybe take a day off and then maybe the next day tried to do it again and then build with everything with comedy, with fucking, I'm sure that's the case with music, with everything, right?

Speaker 3:          01:53:27       And to recognize that that's your choice. And I think of myself, there are some mornings where I'm like, I'm gonna sit and have a latte. And you know, now there are mornings where I'm in a workout. Those are all my choices. Maybe that one day you're going to be that person that just kind of sits there and stares out the window. Um, you know, that would not be work towards my hundred miles that I'm trying to run. That would put, it might be a day where you daydream, he'd come up with an amazing idea and I kind of loved that. I spent the day leading up to that standup on the spot. Actually I thought we had our podcast was yesterday. I had to go back into my text and I kind of like, you know how you do when you like have something to do at one so that I get 11 you're like, well I can't completely go do something else.

Speaker 3:          01:54:11       So I kinda just agonized. And then it was like 12 and I loved and I was like, oh, it's not even today. So now I like kind of like, you know, didn't do stuff. I could have done it for a couple hours and now you know, I thought we were podcasting, so now I have all that time. So I'm just like, well, have that stand up on the spot show tonight. So I really was just looking down. You go [inaudible] if worked out. Yeah, but this lady here she is. Who Was it? Pretty girl? Uh, yeah, so I weirdly, but it was kind of a productive day because then when I got to the end and was so appreciative, it made me so aware of the nightmare of my own head that I was the, I was very conscious of what I, what I was doing. That got me to that.

Speaker 3:          01:55:09       Then when it was so easy, it really was like waking up from a bad dream when you're like, oh, this is life. It's not that being engaged and being present and going to do this thing. It was nothing like what I was beating myself up. Like, why are you doing that? What is that? What is that? Why you say you've done so many shows? But I wasn't even acknowledging that history. I was just stewing in almost because I had the time and I just let that run rampant in my head. That voice of like, Oh really?

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       You think you, you think you can construct a joke? Good luck. You know why? Right? Why did I just feed that monster? Yeah. It's just a common strategy that people do to avoid accomplishing things. Right. And you do it subconsciously to give yourself a little bit of a break because the pressure of like being disciplined and doing things, it's hard. It weighs on you. Right. So then that becomes an excuse to not, we were talking before the podcast about yoga and I was saying how, um, when I did that 15 days in a month thing, I decided to end it with nine days in a row. So I just did nine days. He, I ended like a week early. I finished like a week earlier, like five days early, but I did nine fucking days of yoga in a row to end it. And I was like, this is crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:56:36       I never would've thought, not only that I could do it, I mean I know I could physically do it. It's not impossible, but I didn't think I'd ever like fall through and do that. It just seems too extreme. And that was the beaker him that the half. Yeah. Which people are like, Ooh, I do it everyday. I did 60 days in a row. Yeah. But I do like eight other things. It's not easy to carve out an hour and a half a fucking swinging dick off in this workout. Oh yeah. I'm still, I'm still lifting weights. Yeah. I'm still doing that too. I'm not just doing yoga and I'm also doing writing and the podcast and whatever. UFC shouldn't have to do. Like I made myself do it too. But in doing so, I realized like, Oh, you just got to just do it. Like you just got to say you're going to do it and just do it.

Speaker 2:          01:57:22       Like I did a thing a while back in like 2009, but when I was writing, um, I was up getting ready to do a, my comedy central special at the time, or it was on spike tv than uncommon central. I, um, I wrote every day for a month in my, in my blog. I just decided I'm gonna and I committed to it online. I said, I'm gonna write every day for a month. And in doing that, I'm like, oh, I could do that. Like you just got to do. Let's, uh, let's, uh, it has to be just a thing you do. Like, oh, I brushed my teeth. Oh, I comb my hair. Oh, I right. Oh, I get up and I run an while. I get up and I lift weights for an hour or whatever the fuck it is. Did the or did that yoga tip you one way or the other?

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       Like make you more thirsty or more like tired or more in the day? Yeah, it definitely makes you thirsty. He fucking does. I sweat so much. I can be like, I couldn't drink coffee. I just was like, I need oranges and water and lemons and oranges and water when you sweat so much. But does that, did that affect your other workout that you do? Like was your body just like stop? No. Drink a bunch of water? No, I mean it's, it's easier because, um, if I was going to do the yoga, I would, uh, I would just do stuff like lifting weights or something that night and lifting weights is, um, as opposed to running. Yeah. Sometimes I'd run, I'd do. I'd like to run though in the morning and do yoga later. Like maybe I'll run at eight and then do yoga at 10 30 I've done that because it's not a cardio thing really. You know yoga and also like I like doing yoga and my legs are burnt out cause then like I'd get more flexibility out of them. I feel like your tissues get really beat up and then they become more pliable. If you could just force past that little pain barrier, you know? I really like lifting weights and then going to yoga is amazing if you do like squats and stuff like that because your legs get like super warmed up and it just feels like they're exhausted and you just kind of pull that tissue a partier.

Speaker 5:          01:59:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:19       Yes, yes. Hashtag yes. Hashtag fuck yeah. All right Marilyn, should we wrap this up? Yeah, I'm glad we did. It shows you it again. We should do this again. Yeah, I would love to have you on. Have you thought about doing one of your own? Oh my gosh. I'm going to leave here today going, I got a podcast. I've got a special on it. Doing Yoga twice a day. You should do a podcast for sure. You could do it. I would like to, was talking about the second time you come back. Okay. Okay. Thanks. You good? Bye. Ladies and gentlemen. Goodbye.

Speaker 5:          01:59:54       Got It. Okay.
