Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Five, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Now most people in America consider Calabasas to be one of the safest places as where the Kardashians chose to live. Not Adam, green trees. Adam Green tree lives in Australia, surrounded by Brown snakes which kill you like instantly, right? Be instantly pretty quick. Yeah. Pretty quick. Bunch of spiders you have that'll kill you instantly. Like a ton of hundred. Right. You got crocodiles, you've, you've bathed where I've saw the video of you and campaigns in a fucking puddle that crocodile swim around in, but yet the one day he's in Calabasas, which is like the safest place in America on true. But yeah. Well tell me what happened.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       Well, so I'll hop down to the hotel first thing this morning, the gun trying to find a decent coffee here in America. And uh, the police surrounded the whole, the whole area where the, the coffee shop was and um, they had guns drawn and everything. And then I heard later that someone actually had a gun out and they might have even been shots fired. Yeah. Crazy stuff. And then I'm like, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       at a coffee bean. Yeah. It was at a coffee bean. Yeah. Find out what happened. Jamie. See if there's a story we can. I said it was probably like some wife mad at her husband. It's seamless series called the police. He's got a gun like that. That's happened before. That happened with Ron White. I think his girlfriend packed a gun in his luggage and then that happened with Sam Kennison to his girlfriend, packed a loaded gun in his luggage and then call the police on him. That's crazy. Straight away. I'm like, it's safer in the mountains with the grizzly bears and crap. He is definitely not safer if you actually run into a grizzly bear, but for the most part it's pretty peaceful, right? Yeah. Most people are worried about grizzly bears, but you could be around him for days and days and most likely nothing's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Most likely most likely. But when you, when you were up there, you. Did you run into some walls? Yeah. We say, well, I seen wolves and then the grizzly bears, the one that sort of really scared me. Um, I had a handgun out and I actually had the drawer that handgun a few times while I was up in the mountains. Yeah, there was one real big grizzly, like size 11 boots that I'm coming around camp and was hunting all the trials.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       11 boots. So it's like a 12 foot by 12 inch pad. Yup. Oh my God. Yeah. How big do you think it was? Did you see the actual bar itself?

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       Yeah. So once I actually killed the bull, which was about day 10 or 11, he was sleeping on the caucus, about 60 meters from it. He was sleeping in your car and then he slept on to eat some of it. He didn't touch it. What's, yeah, it was like the first day, so. So I killed that bull in the afternoon a packed out a decent load of meat that night. Went back in the morning, the next morning to pack out the rest of the meat and was going in there looking, thinking they could be a bear on the caucus. And sure enough, I seem to be a brown hair in the creek bottom. So he's just sleeping, just sleeping there and so I yelled at him a prick disease up and had a look around and I yelled at him the second time and he jumped up and he disappeared like that, like scary.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       That's how quickie this is. Thick timber, lot of deadfall and everything and he just disappeared for that. And it actually got me thinking that if you didn't see a bear coming from a distance, handgun, bedspread, whatever you've got, you'd be in serious trouble because he just left that scene dead quiet and in a flash I think can move so fast and those pads that they have on the bottoms of their feet and makes him so sad and quiet. Yeah. And you would think that a thousand pound animal wouldn't be able to move that forward. So I'm strapping meat to my pack. Uh, obviously there's always a blind spot when you're hunched over. And it took me three times longer to get the meat on my path because I was just constantly looking over waiting for that beer to come back because I haven't actually been to the carcass again yet.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       I've seen the bear on the way back in. Pretty scary. How big was it? Giant. Big. 11. Eleven feet tall. Scary. You're alone at deep, deep, deep. I was talking to the fish and game warden in the area and the big grizzly had gone into another hunters' camp on the mountain and just absolutely destroyed these camp. Now I don't know if it was the same bear or different bear, but on three occasions a big brown bear or grizzly come back into my camp and each night that he'd come in he'd get a little bit closer. So the first 90 circled camp about 50, 60 meters away. The next 90 circled camp, about 30 meters away. And the third time he came in, he come right into the back of camp like 15 meters away. Let out these gnarly growl. And at this point my buddy grant Hughes's come in to help me pack out some neat.

Speaker 2:          00:04:53       He's in his tent. I'm in my tent when there's here. This bear walking in for the snow and lets out a growl. I didn't want to go like grant. Did you hear that? Or Grant? There's a beer in camp. I didn't want to let the buyer know that I'm in the tent man. I just laid there dead, quiet. I had the handgun sitting on my chest loaded, ready to go and um, I laid awake for like three hours, like you heard the beer walk off and I laid awake for three hours and I'd get up in the morning and I'm do. I'm like, dude, did you hear that beer? And he's like, did I hear the bear? Holy Shit Dude. I didn't want to move on, make a sandy had the same idea as me. Didn't want to give away. He's location. And I'm like, yeah, it took me three hours to get to sleep. And he's like, sleep, you got fucking sleep. What the fuck? He was like, hell, pissed off man. He laid awake all night. It's like a tent burrito. Yeah. Burrito. Even staying warm in your sleeping bag, you know, like he's got to be able to smell you too. They must know you're your. Yeah. What a wondering if they were, well, if they smell you and then they smell the meat, what they would be more attracted to the. I don't recognize. Smell real good, so hopefully I bet they liked things that don't

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       smell good. I probably do. Yeah. Mate was hanging up probably a good mall from camp at like a because we were out a few different drop points because it was such a. It was four days hike out of meat, so we had different drop points along the way and I never wanted to take any meat and the campus set for what I'd be eating each night, which a cooked meat might smell pretty good to a bear, but I was more concerned about the scent that, that we will be carrying on our boots from meat site to meet site and then walk them back in the camp. But that Bayer had already been in the campaign. He knew where we were and he was doing his rounds obviously every night. Have you done an adventure like this before? This is an epic adventure because you went to Montana, you, you know, you parked.

Speaker 3:          00:06:36       And then how many miles did you go deep into the woods? I was probably about 12 miles in the end. That's no trials or anything like that. Twelve miles. Twelve miles into Montana. Montana is if you folks who have never visited Montana is one of the most unspoiled parts of America, like below Alaska, but not far below. So you're already super remote, like we're already a long way from anywhere and parked at a trail head. And then. So obviously I had 11 days solo by myself and then my buddy grant come in and help me pack that bullet out a ended up being 14 days in the end by the time we got the meat out. Yeah, it's cool. I've done done similar adventures because a lot of hung back home in Australia is all super remote so I'm 90 percent of it's back country really back home. But it's a different kind of back country.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       It's sort of back country bears. Yeah, it definitely is. This was saw low minimal gear because everything's in your backpack that you've got for the hunt. Um, so it's super light and you're cutting down on a lot of essentials that you need, you know, just, just to get back in there when you do this. I've been obsessed with a lightweight backpacking lately. I've been paying attention to, um, these guys that do the Appalachian trail. Yep. Did they hike from Georgia all the way up to Maine? It takes five months. That's insane. They're insane. But it's one of those things that there's a real problem with the human brain. It's like we were talking about our pal campaigns and this a 200 mile run he just did. And when, when there's a challenge in front of you and you find out that someone has done it before you start going, man, maybe I could do 200 miles.

Speaker 3:          00:08:14       You feel like there's something fucked up about people's brains where when they find that someone's doing something, like I have zero desire to take five months out of my life and walk from Georgia to Maine. Yeah. But I bet you once you got it done, that's the difference. But part of my brain was like, I started thinking about it and then my shut up, stupid. You're not fucking hiking to main stop it, but part of me was like listening to this guy. It was on, uh, the rich outdoors. You've done research projects for his podcast. One of his buddies is a, a, a trail guy and they were talking about like lightweight gear and how they can't, they pack the different stream where a guy uses for hunting and what someone uses for a, just these long,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       long, long, long hikes where they essentially were the same clothes for five months. That's the hygienic. Yeah. It doesn't seem. Well, I mean I guess maybe get a chance occasionally to wash them somewhere, but they, everything is the lightest possible stuff that you could have. And when you do this, let's say if you're going to go out there and you're, you know, you're planning on how many days?

Speaker 2:          00:09:19       15. I wanted to do at least half the month in Montana and I wanted to do the other half of the month in Idaho. So 15 days and a little bit of the trips. Got To be unprepared in that sense when you're doing 15 days it, that sort of hunt because the country's like straight up and down. There's no other way to do it. There's no, I'm going to drive to the ridge line or I'm going to walk a decent trail that I reach line or take an atv and it's just all on foot, straight up and down country. So, and, and to have a little bit of roughness to a trip like that, you know, we yar roughing it. That's a bit of the appeal as well and the experience in doing it. So, um, I was just talking with the guys at hoyt and they'll ask him, what's the essentials that you had in your pack that you wouldn't go without?

Speaker 2:          00:10:06       And I'm like, well how about I tell you about the stuff that I wish I had in my pack and that I didn't go out. Like what stuff do you wish I didn't. I didn't take any rain gear and I didn't take any rain gear and, and I didn't check the weather before I went in deliberately because I didn't want any deterrent on the trip. Like, oh, it's going to snow or it's going to high a little. There's going to be gale force winds. I shouldn't go in today or I should pack this extra. I just wanted to ignore all that. Just go in, just live in the wilderness basically with the minimal. And um, I got all that, whether I've got hail three times. I got gale force winds, I got rain followed by snow, so soaking wet then freezing cold and you just had to stay active the whole time. Like I'd literally get to a mountain and I'd sit down for two minutes and you'd go from sweating to freezing cold because you're wet and actually hiked the mountain just to get warm. Were you wearing wool? Nah, whole synthetics.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       So since the synthetics in some, in some cases it's harder to maintain your body temperature when you sweat. That's probably. And perks to both. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       So like I've got a synthetic sleeping bag as well at why is it a little bit more, but I could jump in that sleeping bag wet at night and wake up in the morning and dry. That's a little bit of the difference and it will dry out the next day and uh, it doesn't get, never carries any weight your synthetics. So I just had like a small, a Hoodie, a little hoodie and I had some undergarments and that was about it for the whole trip.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       But as far as like sweating and your clothes and getting your stuff wet, wool maintains body temperature better. It does, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:11:45       Yeah, it does. Next the skin is really good. So like under armour has got some really good next to skin clothing and I'll get wedding that next. The skin clothing and stay warm because it is, it's similar to a wet suit wear suits designed to have some liquid in it and the liquid gets warm and keeps your body warm. That next to skin clothings the same where it's sitting right on your skin and it's going to stay warm like that. So it was it like a spandex almost. Yeah, it is. Yeah. It looks a bit Pansy when you grow up in Rhode and tights. So. So that was a fuck up, right? You should have probably brought some rain gear. Well, I don't want to call it a fuck up because I delivered it. Deliberately done it. Um, to kate white down so much wheat.

Speaker 2:          00:12:27       This is like a lightweight rain Poncho. Um, I don't want to know how it was really heavy and I couldn't carry. It seems like it's not that day, but where do you stop? Where do you stop doing that? Is the big question, right? Yeah, it's, it's weird. You stop. And I was already walking in going this is killer. Like this is hurting. Um, how heavy is your pack? Yeah. I don't get into that sort of stuff. You don't wear it? Nope. I don't why? I don't. Yeah, it just go silent. Sirens. A food. I'll just go. There's a dinner, there's, there's some lunchtime snacks now. Energy. And that's it. If you go in for 15 days, how many days were the food? Do you care? I only took in 10 because I was killing a bull roast. Yeah, exactly. And um, I didn't run out because I shot a grouse and I cooked the grass up.

Speaker 2:          00:13:18       Then I killed my bowl and I was eating meat and I was even cooking meat and then packing it the next day to eat cold, which obviously helped. And it's A. Have you heard this story about me and cam going on the, the Arnhem land tripping over territory back in any food people haven't heard. Well, you. This is the most ridiculous thing ever because you guys had to filter buffalo piss water because buffalo is still. Tastes like piss the color out of it. It had the same taste that the science smell. And my question is if the water's filtered, shouldn't have smelled lever. Yes, it should. Shouldn't it? Yeah. You're drinking. Piss it, drink a paste, paste for security for sure. You guys drank. But veterans got hell or some energy in it though because of Buffalo. Buffalo's Dick if even better, but my energy. I don't know why you were thinking.

Speaker 2:          00:14:11       Get pissed. Tried to jam the door. That first at least to told him to drink the water first. Yeah. He can test that. He saved on. Will they have those crazy filtration systems where you like gravity filters? Is that what you used? Yeah, so I took one of those in the mountains on this trip as well. I never pulled it out and never used it once because I was always drinking water from the highest source directly where it's coming out of the mountain. And if you do that you're okay. You don't have to worry about. Nah, I don't want to say yes because they were go and do it and get sick. Yeah, sue my ass. But I've never. I've always had it nine stomach and I think it's from just doing all that sort of stuff as a kid you sort of grow with that and I think your body's, your body creates its own defense against, against things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       I'm a massive believer in that actually sign with being dirty. And I like, like personal hygiene is obviously a big thing. But um, you know, Alita, I'll lead a chocolate bar with elk blood all over my hands after skin and, or, or deboning and elk and I think that's perfectly natural and normal in that sense. Um, I've never been sick. I've drunk and some silly looking water like that. But I just think if you're at the top of the mountain where the water's first coming out of the hill, out of the rocks, then you're safe because there's nothing along the line. They're like a, an old animal carcass. Frigging wolf, shit sitting in the water or something like that to make you sick. It's coming right out of the ground. It's coming right out the ground. Literally catch it as a streams. That makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:15:38       That's like a. well, and that's handy as well because I'm cancer at the top. So I want to find the highest water source. I don't have to drop down so far each day. Collect water. There's always a good field. And actually when you come across freshwater like that. So how many liters is your pack? How heavy is your pack? It's a 2100. I was a small pack. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a big. That's very small. It's, it's the badlands. That's crazy. Use a 2100 liter pack for a 15 day hunt. Yep. That's how light I'm going in. I have a couple of things that are strapped to that pack, which would make it bigger than that, but generally everything fits inside that package or what's in the pack. Jetboil yeah. That's. Yep. So I've got similar to MSI reactor. They really good. You can actually use it in the cold.

Speaker 2:          00:16:26       It was freezing in my tent, like the whole tent froze over that. Um, I actually turned it on in the tent to warm the tent when I was getting changed or unchanged at night. A little bit. Pansy. But hey it got to put a smile on my face. Boils water super quick, you know. So if the weather is miserable and you just want to get it done at boils water super quick for you. Run a tanker. Propane small. Yeah, just a real little backpack one. And then because I went in there when it was stinking hot, like it was always cooking, like it was the hardest. Wherever you'd have, you wouldn't even imagine having a fire in that, whether from risk of a wildfire, you know, starting the bushfire too, you know, hightailed, it rained and snowed, everything got wet. It was safe at that point.

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       They have a fire and then a lot of the cooking that I end up doing was just over the fire. I'll save my gas each night, um, because I would have ran out of gas before those 15 days are up if I was using just that one canister the whole time and that you'd end up having to pack out, go into town by the gas and then pack all the way back and you'd end up losing two days because it was a, it was a full day walking out with no weight at all. Like, just speed, walking down the mountain, trying to get it out of. There was a full day. So, um, yeah, I've got my reactor, I've got my water filter. But like I said, I never used it. I've got a small one person 10, a mattress at really good sleeping bag. It's actually overrated for the conditions, but I always think you're better off going overrated.

Speaker 2:          00:17:48       You get some bad weather log I had and you've got an underride sleeping bag and you're not getting sleep. You're going to Ms. Hunt now. It's for sure. Um, then I've just got a couple of knives. I've got a full safety kit, bandages. Um, I've actually been carrying. I didn't use them on this trip. Even a little like a water filtration pill, which is always handy. So you didn't have to carry, you feel to kid everyday if you come across some decent water that was down low, you could just put the pill in. But um, we're. A lot of people go wrong with these filtrate. The water filtration and the pills is, you still require both of you come across dirty water because the pills only going to kill bacteria within reasonably clear water. It's not going to kill the solids. So if you're scooping up dirty water, put an appeal in and then drinking anything that's within the solids of that water, you're still going to get sick from.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       So in a sense you're still, you still need the two of them if you want a hunt like that. But the water filtrations or some, because it's 99 point nine, nine, nine percent of all bacteria. It's going to filter out of your water. And the pills are world markets or chlorine or something? Yeah, they like a chlorine pill here. There's a few different ones yet on the market. So you take those essentials. You essentially were in the same clothes everyday. Same clothes every day. I take few changes, the socks and underwear and I'm saying clothes, clothes every day. And then if I did get a hot hot day, this was the plan that never ever happened. But if I did get a hot day and I came past a stream, I was actually going to wash some clothes in like a dry bag, just a bit of water and the clothes and then hang them up and I just never got that break in the weather and I wanted to hunt every day and every minute of light so I'd just get up in the morning and put wet clothes on if I didn't draw them on the fire that night.

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       So it sounds like most of the weight in your pack is food generally? Yep. Just 10 days of food. And how many pounds of food you'd taken the day around? Two? Yeah, maybe a bit less. Yeah, it might've been a bit less. I smashed the chocolate bars when I'm out there. Dude. Why talk about smashed chocolate and nine. But when I'm in the mountains I really smashed chocolate. Um, I just liked that bit of a fix and a bit of a, it's a bit of a pick up, you know, and keep you going. And it's no different than a fire, you know, like if you get a fire going at night, it's at like bit of a boost, like a spirit spirit boost. And it's the same as a chocolate bar just to sit down and go away on a chocolate bar. Just, yeah, life's is good, keep going.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Doesn't matter. But like, um, but as far as like energy, don't you crash when you have one of those things go up high, get a sugar crash. I don't really crash. No. It's funny, I hear it with a lot of people, but yeah, I never crashed. Brendan Burns. We're seeing the same thing. He brings like snickers bars, snickers bars, really good. Milky ways. They like a Mozbar back in Australia, like milky ways here. Anything sugary? Well also I would imagine the amount of calories you're burning when you're walking mountains like that with a pack on heavy pack. It's huge. I had um, but I had the desire to actually go and do this trip and do a bit of weight loss at the same time. I think if I wasn't going to do weight loss at the same time, then I'll probably pack some more food, some more goodies, but you did it on purpose to lose some weight and I did, I lost weight.

Speaker 2:          00:21:09       I lost a lot of white doing it, but yeah, def definitely done on purpose. There'd be some, some days where I'd just have a snack in the morning for breakfast, like an energy bar and actual energy bar in the morning and I'd go all the way through and I wouldn't, I wouldn't hide back in the camp til 1130 at night because I was trying to stay out where I thought the balls were and I'd have a quick dinner in camp that night and that was it. And I wouldn't even feel hungry throughout the day. Um, yeah. I think just from being so active and obviously good water intake whenever you can, I just, there was never a point where I'm like, oh, ahead, I'm starving the day, you know, I'm not going any further until eight or anything like that. It was just, it was all go, go, go.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       And Yeah. Now when you take a plan like this, when you decided to go on a deep, deep mountain on like this, what do you, uh, how do you pick where you're going? Are you a, you studying google earth and you getting tips from people studying Google Earth's the big one, you know, and um, I would suggest for anyone that wants to do a backpack hunt, you know, like a do it yourself hunt is study google earth and I'll do a radius. I would look for a radius with the least amount of roads, any sort of infrastructure around it, like the most wilderness looking area, even away from trial heads. I hate been near a trial head or where there's a trial that people are going to be walking in on or anything like that. Like I mean real back country. You've got a Bush bash it to get in there just fine, you know, do your research, find that area with the least amount of activity and then put a.in the middle or roughly in the middle.

Speaker 2:          00:22:41       And that's where you should set up camp and like getting that live with the balls or whatever, animals you're hunting, get in there and live with them. And um, I think not being afraid to fail on a hunt, the big one because you know, a lot of people or they might not even be any bulls there. But yeah, who cares. It's going to be an awesome experience anyway. And it's a place that you can tick off the list. I'm not going back there. There was nothing there. And then next year, try the next bottle. The next week, try another spot. Um, I had hunted around that area previously and so I knew there was elk in the area. Um, I just had never been that far back in before. And I tell you, to tell you the truth, it is nearly completely filed on me because I went days and days without hearing or seeing or an elk. But the sign was there to say that we're in, in there. It's just that the grizzlies and the wolves were hunting that area so hard that it shut the fuck up and pushed a lot of them out of the area. Yeah. And then I was nearly new food source.

Speaker 2:          00:23:39       So. Wow. So when you get in there and you don't see anything for a couple of days, like what, what, what is

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       the mindset like? What do you mean?

Speaker 2:          00:23:47       He hates a day out and there's always that like you second guess yourself. This was a stupid move you shouldn't have came in here. You need to change spots, but then it's like, but at the same time your experience in this for a reason, and this is how hunting should be. Hunting should be hard. You should hunting never be unless you've done your research going into a place and there's just like game walking past year everywhere. There should always be, because that's the hunt, right? Finding it or going through the hardship to find it, tracking it, find and find them where's the better spot within that area. So at the same time that when winds like, you know, you've made a bad decision, this is a crap spot, the be, there's the whole experience of like, no, this is how hunting should be. It should be difficult. You should have to work your ass off to try and find the animal.

Speaker 2:          00:24:32       And when you actually do find that animal, how much better is it because you know, it's just like if, if you hunted for 11 months and you didn't say a bull, you found a boy, you had a shot in your midst, but then the next one you get, how good's that next one that you get, you know, if that was the case and it was very similar on this trip where I put in all that effort, didn't see an animal. One opportunity, a ball comes in. I ended up calling that bull from like a mile away. You could just hear him coming up this canyon. And I did that shot and dude, I teared up. I was crying because I knew how much had gone into it. You know? And it's not just the effort, but you know, like obviously I'm, I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       I'm away from the kids for a month now. There's all that sacrifice is all the hard shit. There's all the effort. There's walking in, there's putting up with that absolutely atrocious wherever. And then finally one opportunity comes up and you kill that animal as well as kill an animal. That's a hard thing to do, man. I balled up. I was crying like I think I cried a dozen times. Every time I thought about it when I was standing over the ball I was crying and I'm like, that's why it's got to be that hard so you can appreciate their animal. So you realize what has to go into the hunt to actually get something killed. Should I think everyone should be like that. I hope they're not.

Speaker 3:          00:25:49       Well there's, there's a lot of elk in Montana, but Montana is so huge. Yeah. Massive, massive place. And the amount of wilderness that you were encountering, if you have, you know, herds of elk all over the place, it's super likely that you could like wind up in a spot with nothing around you for miles and miles around. Yep, exactly. So the, the. I think the heartbeat with that country that I've been going into is the wolf populations getting so big. I know you love wolves is pitches of frigging wolves in this joint everywhere. But I do love them all. I want to share to know where they're scary. Definitely scary. What's weird is what we were talking about before the podcast started. You were talking about Australia and what you call the greenies, which are the green people that want to. They don't want animals to die and they want this population to explode, but there's not a balance.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       And that was the idea behind reintroducing wolves was to create a balance because there was a lot of animals that were living in the yellowstone greater yellowstone area. And so they introduced these wolves. But the problem was they had an agreement when they introduced these wolves that when they reached a sustainable population, they reached a certain numbers of several thousand wolves, then they would open up a hunting season on them to try to control the population, but as soon as they reached that number, the people that were involved in the relocation of the rules and the wildlife protection people and all the people that are like really animal rights advocates, they, they backed out of it and they said, no, we don't want any hunting on any of these worlds ever. And so there's this big battle and a lot of states have opened up hunting seasons on wolves, Montana included.

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       But it's still, there's a battle, there's a battle to try to control the wolf populations. It's funny, like I went. So I went into yellowstone last year after my hunt just, you know, thought I had all my photography gay and um, I didn't say a single elk, but you got to go near where the people are. I saw a ton of them. Isn't that crazy? I was there with my kids. We got selfies with fucking elk. No, it's like the whole time I was like, fucking wolves. They've wrecked this joint. Didn't say anything. Well, the elk have decided that people are super safe because no one has hunted in yellowstone for 100 and whatever the hell years. So when you go to the visitor area, when you first pull into yellowstone lake, yellowstone has like this, uh, and this is on the Montana side. Yellowstone has this area where there's like a gas station and there's like a store and it's fucking elk everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       Like I'll show you my friend. I got selfies, I got elk selfies. But they're, uh, they, they're not even remotely nervous about people that aren't k. yeah, you don't, you aren't doing days. Um, access data and having Texas, the Cheeto d, your stupid head. That's how I saying, but in the background that just living in the hotels, but it looks hilarious. They're just chilling back there and there was a gang of a man that's all. They were all over the place. There were a. it's, it's really weird because it's like, right when you pull into the area, all you see is like just loads of arrowhead. Yeah, so that, that the data that we have nightgown live near the station. So the station in Australia, obviously it's just like a ranch and I like a big farm because of the dingoes just smashed, it smashed the population so that those title did. I got back on near the homesteads because the dean goes less likely to come around the home. It's really crazy and then you move. If you're hunting you'd be like, screw this, I'm gone back into the back country now. There's going to be hateful or deer back there compared to ran in the house and there'll be no deer out there at all. What? They would be very limited, Debbie. There'll be the stags that are moving through the area and that's about

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       it. The nucleus of the cheadle deer live around the homestead where it's safe. They're not dumb. That's interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Same thing with deer in around here. You'll find them in suburban areas. Yeah, but he also find coyotes and suburban areas, but less mountain lions, mountain lions try to avoid human populations more and that's what usually gets

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       deer out here. All the news back home has been mountain lions in behind your house. Probably. There's quite a few. Yeah. Yeah. Cool

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       pictures of them. There's Bobcat's I've seen bobcats out near me, but there's, there's a mountain lions in California for sure. There's quite a few of them. California is an interesting place because, um, you know, California, they don't want to control the predators. They want the predators to control the game population. And because of that, there's not that many

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       deer here. Yeah, yeah. I understand that it's not. And I can say the method behind it, you know it. Well, my issue is that humans in a sense of the ultimate Predator, right, and that everything should be not controlled. But um, you know, what's the good way of saying this? Is that that Bain, the Apex Predator that we are, we are, you know, we obviously got a part in that whole food chain as well when it comes to things like that. Some people don't agree with that, they understand that and I can say, you know, we'll talk before about the wolves been introduced to control the population and the numbers, but there's obviously got to be a point where the wolves are controlled as well. Right? So who does that? Well, that was all well

Speaker 1:          00:31:13       done early, early on in North America because of cattle ranchers. So what they would do is they would shoot wild horses. They had a huge wild horse problem and the wild horse problem is actually a, it's reemerging. There's quite a few wild horses in North America and they're trying to figure out what to do with them. And it's really controversial. It's very, it's kind of interesting. Um, but what they would do back then was they would shoot these wild horses and then they would shoot a wolf. They would shoot like one of the Alphas and they would take the wolf and rub it and take it sank glands and rub it all over the, a dead horse and then fill the horse up with strychnine. So the other wolves would come around. They would smell. They're missing Alpha friend. And uh, they would eat the, eat this horse carcass, and then we'd get district on and die.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       So doing that, they extra painted walls from the majority of the American West. That's how they killed them all. Yeah, it's really. But then they realized that they did a terrible thing by doing that. And so they started reintroducing them. There's a balance somewhere. Obviously. I love wolves. I think they're cool as hell. But there's, there's a, there is a balance. But the balance is real tricky. It's because like there's a, a very small number of them in Washington state, but the small number of them, the small number of wolf packs, I've started attacking cattle ranches and they're killing these cattle. And so these ranchers want these wolves killed. And so they've decided to kill some of the wolves and it's a huge controversy in Washington state because they're like, look,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       there's not that many fucking balls and you guys are going to kill these walls because they're killing the cattle, but you're going to kill the cattle too if you want to have cattle. This is what, this is the price you pay. But I'm sure you've seen how they run cattle out here. They just let them roam around on public land. You know, when we were in Nevada, we were a deer hunting the Steven Rinella yet yet. And we saw a lot of deer. There's deer everywhere, but we saw way more cows. Fucking cows are everywhere and they just, they roam all throughout this public land and the ranchers pay some sort of a fee and they. This was, that was what that whole thing was going on. Yeah. A lot of that happens back home in Australia as well. Yeah. So they roam all over the place.

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       Just fucking cow shit everywhere. We're essentially, we're camping out so we're sleeping on couches. There's no shit everywhere. You live comfortable. It wasn't happening. The lox, spread it out a bit. I actually wound up sleeping in the back of the suburban. We had a suburban and I was like, why are you guys going to sleep on the ground? And you just fold the seats back asleep on his flat area? No. So I camped out in the back of a suburban while these dummies are sleeping on the ground on cow patties. They want to be done with nature man down with cap, who if you want to be down with nature, take off the sleep you want to really get. But exactly. Yeah. But it's um, you know, these animals, if you're going to let them wander around like that roam free, which is nice because they're essentially almost wild.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       They're free range cattle. They're eating grass, so healthiest cattle you could eat, but wolves like to eat them too. And so it's a real tricky. It's like where do you draw the line? There is not that many wounds and these wolves are eating these cows and. But to the ranchers, each cow is worth several thousand dollars every time a wolf kills a cow. That's a big loss of income. Yeah. I suppose that's working. There's gotta be some sort of line there where we work in conjunction with wildlife, with your ranch or not. Whether you're losing income or not, you know, that's got to be part of the system and maybe it should be subsidized by the taxpayers instead of killing the wolves. Maybe they should subsidize some of these ranchers. I mean if these wolves are killing, it's only a certain amount as long as they've taken some measure of protection, try to keep the wolves away.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       But to ensure a healthy wolf population would ensure a balanced ecosystem. See they can't bring it back to where they used to be because where they used to be, there was no wool. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, there's a funny thing at home, how you sign it should be subsidized. So I always, my, my business is in northwestern Australia for the mines and they've got their own private train law and they run their own trains. We've all I know. And the train lines on fence so the cattle can cross the train line anytime of trying. It's one of those cows, they've got to pay the farmer, you know. Oh Wow. And I've heard stories about the Pharma just going out and shooting these cattle along the train line. So the mines pay him, pay him for the cows, look like they've been hit. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty funny. Oh, that's hilarious. So maybe we could do

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       something like that with where the wolves just pay out where every time they kill a cow. Right. Some people believe that shit. Well, someone would probably do that. There's probably some unscrupulous people, but that didn't get caught and they'd get prosecuted. It would balance itself out, but there's a certain amount of numbers where they, the wolves reach a high population number where all the other animals started getting threatened. Like there was a recent situation in Wyoming where these wolves killed 19 elk and didn't even eat them. They just killed them. Real killing. Just fucking around having a good time, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:36:09       Yeah. They do that. That's the point where obviously we've got to stand in my decision whether it's a tag system will or some sort of calling. You know. I think before the program we'll talk in about where kangaroos needed to be called because it's, it's a little bit like. Yeah. So the Greens don't want to miss the greenies that want to kill the Kangaroos, but for the benefit, for the better benefit of Kangaroos. So it has to come a point where the numbers need to be controlled. Otherwise they ate, they sell out of land and home, they get diseases and it takes weeks to die like a suffering death. Like now on one side. So you can't be just for one and not the other.

Speaker 1:          00:36:50       My Buddy Mike Hockridge, he lives up in BC, in northern BC, British Columbia. And uh, he, he was attacked by Wolf, like he had shot a wolf in mid air as it was jumping on them. They have so many wolves up there that they have literally a, had open season. Like there's no tag limits. You could shoot wolves. Sounds like to go there. Yeah, it's, we went up there and this is a, we were moose hunting. That's where I got this one. And uh, we found a calf that had been torn apart by wolves and it's really fascinating. But he put this up on his instagram, his, um, his instagram is BC outfitter pcf. This is him last night. Listen to this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:37:29       Oh, that's awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       This is just last night.

Speaker 2:          00:37:41       It'd be hell and back. Come in by me and say what happened? Started. He actually started it. He started the howl. We can hear it here. Yeah. He called him. God, that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       That's a theory. That sand when you're in camp by yourself. When you hear that. I ran. Yah. That's what a fucking awesome in the area. At the same time animal ever because they're smart. You operate in packs. They have really complex social system. I'll tell you these cool little story. When I was in northwest territory, good luck just above the arctic circle. The first time I've been in the country like the Mckenzie Mountains and I was actually hunting Moose, but I had a wolf tag as well and the very first morning like we get up out of the tent, we walk up the river and with a guide, Byron and I say it like a pack. Wolves coming down the river and so they'd been hunting that area I think ended up being day three. They. They chased the Caribou up and down the river like just to a levering sweat.

Speaker 2:          00:38:45       Then like chase in the river and I surrendered that didn't the with the river and that Caribou and was a bull as well. Got to the point. It's whole body was quivering because it's been really hot and then it's been chased into this freezing cold river. At that point the wolves just left it and they all went up and sat in the sun because they a wet as well. They went and sat in the sun and I got old dry and then it was like mother nature just took over. From that point they they, they got the Caribou to the point where they knew it was going to die and left it and ended up I couldn't hold its own legs up and end up laying down in the river and drowned in the river. How cool is that? That they knew that, so the. The wolves get to the point where they're like, okay, we're going to go and sit in the sun now and dry out. This thing's dead. Anyway, we're just kind of come back to it now. Once it's drowned in the river,

Speaker 3:          00:39:29       what the fuck? How do they know that? That's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       And then by that afternoon that Caribou was just a ribcage. Like they just, they absolutely plucked every bit of meat and organs out of that Caribou.

Speaker 3:          00:39:42       Wow. How cool is that? I've got photos of it actually. Do real work. Do you have online anywhere? They probably all my instagram early days. Instagram. Yeah. So Adam Green tree bone and tag them on my instagram. So if, see if you could find those champions, but uh, you'll see these Caribou just standing in the water and I'm like, it was just quivering. It was, it was done. It was done. And I knew that it was done and they're just like, oh, we'll come back in an hour and a fucking smarter than fucking smarter than. Cool. Have you also heard that in their spore? Um, there's um, something

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       that, like elk, if they sniff it stays in the dirt forever. So they basically shoot it out, stays in the dirt forever. An elk will go long grazing and eat the grass. And this spore attacks the elks lungs in drinks, the lung capacity. So it's, it, it's, it basically makes the elk tired when they're

Speaker 3:          00:40:34       running for the wolf to grab them at a later date. Wait a minute. So then we looked, they thought they shit out. The what, what they ate and spores spores are released into the dirt when the elk eating, eating the grass. Like they take it into their system and it produces their lung capacity, reduces their lung capacity. So it's like they're poisoning the well before they jack them. Is that not the ultimate Predator or not? Yeah. How is nature so complex? And it's cool, isn't it? Well, the thing about wolves now too, it's really kind of cool to see. I'm so torn. I'm so torn because on one hand I love elk hunting. I love elk. I love the idea that they're out there and they're wild. But I'm a big fan of wolves. I love the fact that these wolves are so fucking bad ass ranch is right now gone.

Speaker 3:          00:41:25       Fuck you. Joe Rogan. Well, my friend Mike, he where he lives in BC, his neighbors ranch gang of them jumped cow like they got, they got hungry and that winter and they said, you know, let's just fucking do this. How much easier of a feed is that? Pretty easy nail that runs flood out that's got legs, that standard, the grant effect, Kale that's down here that might even run away, you know, it's a pendant to the ELC was pinned in or the cow rather was coming in and they, they, they jumped on, jumped the fence. I guess, and this is one of the things that's so appealing to me about bow hunting. It's not actually just bow hunting, it's the holiday though. Whole pitcher and wildlife. When you get into it like this and you start looking at it and thinking about it, it's crazy. Who doesn't want to be a part of that?

Speaker 3:          00:42:08       Well, we're so filtered from it for the most part, most people's interaction with wild animals in the zoo or a squirrel who look, I see a skunk. There's an eagle. Crazy. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I saw an eagle like it's a big day, but to actually go to a place like where you went and to hear well, a lot of people always like, oh, that's crazy. That's crazy. It's actually not that crazy when you go out and experience that sort of things happening all the time. It's just that people are so disconnected because they're not out there experiencing it. I was telling a story, but we're going to wedgetail illegal at home and I can hear these pig squeal and like, I'm like, like a lock. My knees just can't pick up where these peak school and coming from and it's going straight over the top of my head.

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       There's a which title? Legal with this pig and it flies it over. It knew exactly what it was doing and flies that gets it up real high and it drops it perfectly over this rocky outcrop on the mountain to open it up like that stock, man. You gone. I need a steak knife to cut into the meat. Yeah. That was just gone on eight, a rocky outcrop to cut into this meat and potatoes. The pig. That was pretty decent. It was like this, like 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 40 pounds, maybe 30. I've seen them drop goats off cliffs, like the goats are climbing cliffs and the Eagle swoops down and grabs a hold of it and how bad that video with the Eagle tries to pick up the baby out of the pram or whatever, and that's real, don't. Yeah, I think that's fake Internet.

Speaker 3:          00:43:41       Seriously. I'm sure it's probably happened before. Definitely happened. When you look in the eye of an eagle, you realize, oh yeah, the thing would eat a baby. Yeah. I think the idea that it would need a baby's a joke they had built for it. It's just another animal. Yeah. They don't give a fuck kid. No, no offense to anyone's babies, but yeah, no. The reality is there's a great video of this guy in Alaska. We've played it on the podcast for the guy with all the eagles in his yard. Eagles in Alaska are so prevalent. I have a friend who goes up there and she was telling me that they're like, pigeons. She's like, they're like fucking pigeons were everywhere. Like you don't even care anymore, like these fucking things out here with this guy's got this backyard and in his backyard he's got fucking hundreds and hundreds of eagles.

Speaker 3:          00:44:25       I mean maybe not hundreds, 150, 15 ago, 10:30, but they're fucking everywhere. Is this the video? So this is the same one. So what it is, is he's got a. where did I come up with hundreds? How dare me. So he's got a bunch of fish that he's got laid out and uh, they've got it. I'm like, look at this, look at all these fucking eagles just walking around this guy's backyard. This ain't shit compared to what we're going to show you in a minute folks. But um, these eagles are wandering around this guy's yard and he has his kid take a bucket of fish and dump it out for these eagles. And I just would not be that confident having these fucking monsters coming here. My kids. No, that'd be a sort of raptors, man. This is, I don't know that saying video. Grab each one of them.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       God, look at this thing. There is so weird. It's such a weird animal that's a living dinosaur. Oh, it really is. Yeah. It's such a weird animal too. It's just so strange. And we chose that heartless monster is the American bird, you know. I mean, couldn't. Couldn't be American animal would be like a puppy or something. We've got on our coins, I've got like platypus. And wombat. Nothing would take nothing close. That's a good move because this thing is just living dinosaur, like literally a raptor of flying raptor look at. It's just creep once, once that fish but doesn't want to take a chance of getting shot. I won't. One an eagle. Yep. I've got a weight AAPL my property up in the mountains on my farm. We've got a couple of wage tiles that hang around up there and whenever we kill a deer we leave the coc and say, oh, I'll put a scout in camera on it and stuff like that and just to see these things come down and they eat and what they do.

Speaker 3:          00:46:09       So cool. Now a wedgetail egos at the size of a Golden Eagle or a bald eagle or how big they get. A couple of meters in wingspan. They. Oh Wow. So it is like that, but yeah. Wow. Have you ever seen the heartbeat eagle? That's the biggest one. Yeah. Lives in Venezuela and they eat monkeys and it's uh, it's fucked up to watch man. It's really stressful with your last day. I think that she was on, like, I'd just be straight up stressing all the time. I just lay out and be like, guess get it over and done with. Yeah. There's a, they love sloss because sloths are just designed to get fucked up by the eagles. I love this eagle is God damn huge. Look at the monkeys. Like fuck this. The monkeys like, get out of here man. But the sloths can't do anything. They're just so slow.

Speaker 3:          00:46:55       They can't do shit shit except foot stare at it and go piss off. He just walks up to it and grabs it. He's like, man, let me just fucking claw the shit out of you here, dude. Bloody get off me. Don't touch me. Look at this. Poor Long. Not a goddamn thing. You can do. Look at him. Oh, this is a weird one. I haven't seen this video. All right, watch out. I'll touch her titties. Getting out to be the only one I've seen before is one swoops down and grabs one says slough fights back. Oh, barely. Really? A fight. But no, get fade. That's guy that's going to be when you're 90, you get in a head lock. Fucking carrier. Just so weird that nature gave this animal. No defense system in nature. Just fuck this loft. How coola off you say that one walk and it's almost looks like it's got bloody algae growing on that green one on the road.

Speaker 3:          00:47:48       How weird are they? Will do. A lot of them do have. Oh yeah, they do have green growing on them. One at a zoo here that has all this mold grow all over its back and you can. Yeah, look at it right there. That's the ones because they move so slow that literally moss and shit can grow on them. What a fucking goofy ass productive jaimee. I like synergy sight sound. He's like boom. He's the best. The best man. He needs another one. Another race, another raise for changing. Look at this fucking thing, man. I mean that doesn't even look real. If you told me that that was a creature in a movie, I'd be like, that's going to come and get you. That's the boogie monster comes in the middle of the night.

Speaker 3:          00:48:32       He already eats babies and that's what it looks like. It looks like some fake crazy that technology has brought us this fall where we can look at a video right now at that slaw. But to tell you the truth, if you hadn't traveled the world, you wouldn't even know that animal really existed. Well, that's why they used to have to have zoos. That's one of the main reasons why I'm opposed to zoos. Yeah. I mean I'm, I'm, I'm pro zoo as far as like, they raise a lot of money for conservation. There's some animals that actually thrive in zoos. Like we were joking around about it the other day about giraffes. I used to have this joke in my act about giraffes don't give a fuck about being the zoo. They don't feel bad at all. They love it. They just wander around going another day and then just slowly walk around because drafts are the only animal.

Speaker 3:          00:49:13       You let babies feed them, but what if they don't realize that got life, that good luck us today. You know, like it takes a back country hunt for you to go home and go, shit, I just flick a switch and a light comes on. Any type of hot water comes on. Those drives are probably just ignorant and I really don't know. You know? They definitely know they've got a good. There's not lions chasing them everyday. Well, what's fucked up about the Santa Barbara Zoo? Santa Barbara Zoo is great, but the fucking, the a giraffe cage is right next to the lion cage. Like literally is that tear? Remind them, boy, this is what it could be like. That's what they should do. They should let them out for a week. They should let him out for a week. Let lines and shit chased him around, let them back into zero and go see.

Speaker 3:          00:49:56       That's what it could be like. What do you want? Yeah, stop being such an asshole. He let us live. But look at this, people can feed them and look at that little kid. No one's even remotely worried about the behavior of giraffes. They've never exhibited any aggressive behavior. Katie looked a bit stressed. He just didn't know. He's just maybe a little pissy about that. Kids going to grow up, but Jitsu kick your ass. I don't think he's got more than Jujitsu for a giraffe. Ninety, you'd be raw. You need a hoist. So these giraffes are right

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       next to this fucking cage where, I mean there are only separated by a couple of fences. There's two fences and right over there as these lionesses, that's all. And you can get. They have fit glass. You can get right like where you are to me, you can get right up to the line, but when you get right up to them, you feel so vulnerable. Like you know there's glass, but that cat's looking at you and you'll let your whole body just starts going, get the fuck out. We should. That's your instinct, dude. What are you doing? Yeah, there's something about cats. Oh, you've seen this one where this baby is standing there. It turns its back and the lion, the lion can't even help it. No, it's just the instinct. Yeah. But as soon as the kid turns its back, it's like, no, fuck man. Shit. Did you see any mountain lions when you're out there?

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       A one count into the kill site. He's Prince role for the snow there. Really? Yeah, and that country's pretty known for mountain lions as well. A two or three years ago when I was in there and we've got fresh. No, and I went right up high. I'm big mountain tracks like in that space because there was fresh. Now I'm sure there's fresh mountain tracks everywhere. I walked everyday, but it's just that there was fresh snow and it left the tracks perfectly in the snow. Like how many times do you walk past the mountain lion and staring at your. How many times has it been a mountain lion off in the distance looking at Ya and you had no idea it was there. You don't know they're there and then every now and then you'll get a weird feeling like I'm being funny sense. You know, and I hate saying it because people will say bullshit, but I'll get a funny feeling that someone's looking at me and if I stopped at that point and have a look around, chances are I'll find a deer or a fox or something staring at me from in the up on the ridge or in the timber or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       Happened with Shane. Dorian. Yeah. Shane on the show not long ago, Shane was out hunting with me just before he come on your show and I stopped. I'm like, dude, I just got this weird feeling of being watched and we looked around and then yeah, there's a box like looking beyond the three, staring straight at us, you know, so it's like, it tickles a sense, that's for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       Do you think, you know, this is going to get into the womb. Do you think that when you're out in the woods for days on end a week on end with no cell phone service? No, nothing. Just quiet woods and animals and you're alone. It's just you. Do you think that activates certain senses or reignite certain centers that are dormant? Right. Ignites

Speaker 2:          00:52:50       really. We kind of gone for such a long period where you had to hunt, you know, that's just how people were, you know, like the natural world is people out in the woods just like with the animals that all that ignites and it fades when we're looking at frigging technology like we do or you're so busy in your lifestyle and what you in what you do, like obviously parts of the body's got to, you know, we to shut this down. We're doing this now. You know, we're moving forward in the world, move forward in the world. Bullshit. Let's move back. That definitely ignites and it's what I just said, you know where I'm like, I feel like someone's watching watching this or the way you react or your listening or what you're here and just all your senses become so fine tuned to the wilderness.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       A man. It's a beautiful thing. Yeah. The move forward is an interesting way of looking at it because I don't think technology necessarily is having us move forward, but what it's definitely having us do is move different. We're, we're, we're, we're interacting with each other less in the physical sense and more in the digital sense and we're way less likely to interact with the rest of the wild world. Where in the world the wild. That's a weird term to like. I've always felt like the word outdoors, like I love the outdoors, like how fucking weird or people that we call the whole world outdoors, but I like, we're so used to being in these shelters that the sheltered life is normal, but the outdoors out of the shelter. Well that's the actual word. That's actual world. Yeah. That's you. What? You go to the door to go out there camping.

Speaker 2:          00:54:23       You go to the outdoor? Yeah. Oh, well the outdoors. Like what a weird description. Yeah. Outdoors. You know, it's a strange way of looking at the wilderness. The wilderness is a much better term, but outdoors is like, oh, I love the great outdoors. What the fuck are you talking about? I love the world. How it is today. I think he said it on a shy not long ago. We had never had it better than we have now. One hundred percent. If you don't think we've got a better now, it's because you're not looking at and you're not appreciating everything that there is, so I like technology in the sense that I can connect with a lot of people you campaigns and stuff like that. I wouldn't have friendships with you guys if it wasn't for how technology was to die. You live on the other side of that.

Speaker 2:          00:55:03       Exactly. How crazy is that? And the world becomes really small, so I love all that, but at the scientologist height, the disconnect that pay will have a height that everyone's so busy trying to work for a living and have a nice car or a big house or something like that, and in the end that shit's not even important. It doesn't even matter. It's not like it's not the memory that you're going to get from going out to the wilderness or the connection or the appreciation. I appreciate me because I've had to kill myself. I appreciate power because of going without power for weeks. I appreciate hot water. You appreciate all those things. Like a car, a paved road, rubbish service. Someone comes to your house and collects you frigging rubbish. Serious. Not Serious about it. Yeah. There was a point where we couldn't get done what we would today because you had so much else to do, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       You're on rubbish. Probably grow your own vegetables or drive or walk or horse. Ride the dye into town to get vegetables or whatever it was and washing your clothes. We didn't sit in there for scrubbing brush and Washington. You close over. Bode would take hours and hours. Now you just throw it into a machine. I'll come back and get it when it's convenient for me and pull it out so you get to do a lot more in today's world, but it also. There's so much to do that it's a lot of people don't get to do what we do and go outdoors and experience at or appreciate those things because they haven't had that hardship. You know, the mountains is a hard can be a hard and miserable experience, but it makes you appreciate the things in modern life

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       that are hard anymore. It's a prospective enhancer because it's a reality check because you realize, wow, what a strange world we live in, that we need shelter and we fire and we need all this stuff in order to survive without that stuff. When you're out there like as as minimalistic as you've done it, like doing it with a small pack, which few days where the food and sleeping under a cloth house, a little tent, you know, I mean that's a perspective enhanced because it gives you this real appreciation of what people have actually accomplished, but most folks are not doing that and so they get really detached from where their food comes from. Really detached from the world itself and it's not, it's not their fault. It's just the environment that you're accustomed to. We're all accustomed to supermarkets and restaurants and being able to just get a bottle of water. I'm thirsty. Let me just pop the top on. This table is still complaining about that Shit. That's the crazy thing, I

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       think people will still complain about that and I'm like, dude, you need to check yourself. Went to Africa a couple of years ago and was lucky enough, real poor village and in Mozambique and everyone's still smiling like it was an unseasonal year and it was really cold. So, um, what we go for this village and a lot of these villages, you've never seen what person before, and we go for these villages and it's free o'clock in the morning and they're all standing around the fire. And I said to the guy beside me, the local guy, I'm like, oh, did they all start work early? And he's like, Nah, like, can't sleep. And I'm like, what do you mean they can't sleep? And he's like, well, it's really cold. I don't have blankets or anything like that. So they get up in the morning, they started far and they all huddle around the fire to get warm because it's freezing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:20       And it's not that they don't have the money to buy blankets. There's no blankets, there's no frigging blankets for sale. It's as simple as that. There's not like, oh, they don't have the $20 to buy a blanket. There is not even the resource for there to be a blanket available for in the Bot. There's babies crawling around in dust that's like six, seven, eight, eight inches thick. The dust around the village because you know, all the, they'll walk around the village and created a lot of dust. No one's complained in there. That's what they used to. And they're happy frog fro someone from our society in that man, they'd be miserable. They probably cut their own freaking risks and, and, and all. I, I come home from their thinking. Those people have got it that hard. It's what they used to, but they've got that hard and they're still smiling, you know. And it was a bit of a check for me. I've got power, I've got running water and I've always been appreciative of these things anyway. But um, we've got power, we've got water, we've got in Australia, we've got Medicare, you know, like real good health services. We've got everything like that and people still find

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       something to complain about and it's just because I haven't been through a real hardship in their life that they don't realize it could be a hell of a lot harder than this. This isn't even hard. It's easy. It's just what we're used to and we used to complain in the Baylor. Well, it's also one of the strange things that we've created by co creating houses that have electricity inside them and easy access to food and shelter with sleep, but a nice comfortable mattress. What? By doing that and by detaching ourselves from the natural world, I think we remove just a little bit of the mystery of being alive. How bizarre it really is to be a living creature and amazing. It is amazing. Yes. I mean, when you're. When you were walking through the woods and you're seeing that grizzly bear who sleeping on the carcass of the elk, that bear has been living like that probably for if you've ran into an 11 foot bear, how many years is he like 15 years old and being.

Speaker 3:          01:00:15       Yeah, it's a giant fucking huge monster bear. That's just out there surviving the hard way for a long time in Montana. Going through these winters doesn't give a shit if it rains. If it's sunny, if it's snowing, doesn't give a shit. It doesn't even give a shit about a pack of wolves. Black doll eyes. You see their eyes when you look. I ran into one grizzly bear in my life where it was in the wild only once and it was last year with Cam and Alberta. I was actually with Jen, Jen and Jen said turnarounds at grizzly and we turned around. This is grizzly looking at us and this motherfucker was looking through me. Yeah, there's such a difference in the way they look at you and he's not looking at it and going, I'll try Rogan. No, they look through. Look through you and the Strangeness Apex Predator Way.

Speaker 3:          01:01:07       Well, they have like this dead look in their eyes. It's very. It's a very strange, endless. Yeah, it is. It's like A. I shouldn't say Saul was probably so harsh, harsh way, but I don't even know if a soul is real, but that what you're saying. Exactly that. I don't give a shit. They don't give a shit. That's what it is. Compassionate. This is just a part of life. If I feel like I'm gonna, I'm going figure it out. Yeah. I remember the first video I ever saw a bear killed a moose. The bear chased the Moose, knocked it down and started eating it. Guts first while it was alive. Just holding it down and eating it. That's nice. Yeah. This is it. This is the funny bit. You know where these extreme greenies think these animals go around hugging each other. Yeah. Like, ah, that's my cousin and I will have cut to catch up and have it be lighter and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          01:01:52       No, I didn't give a fuck. They don't care if you're screaming and hal and it's just going to eat you. It's like the [inaudible] a dingoes back home if thing. Guys get a cough back home. They don't lock all. I'm going to be humane with this cough. I'll, um, I'll bought it first. I'll tear it out and make sure it's died. And it's peaceful and stuff like that. They'll just start eating it right there and then it will die in its own time. You know that that's not even a full process for these animals. No. They're just concerned with consumption. When you, when you do see them do it too. When you do see them eat something, it's just like, oh yeah, of course. That's how they do. Exactly. Yeah, but you don't. You don't think of it that way. You know, it's movies, man. Movies have confused the shit out of people and then being away from them for long periods of time.

Speaker 3:          01:02:37       Yeah. But we can't blame the movies because it's on that individual. I'm smart enough. You're smart enough. Common Sense tells you that that's a movie they're not really like that. You know? How can people be that disconnected to think that's actually how animals live that life. It's just a frigging movie. People that just, I don't think they really think that, but they're not exposed to the harsh reality of it. Like they, I don't think they really think that the bears talk to each other and English and then they hug each other and they help people. But, but the reality of seeing bears in Klondike bar commercials and Coca Cola ads, that does fuck with your head, it does plants the seeds of what a rinella calls. Uh, what does it call it? A charismatic megafauna. These things become, they become your friends, your, your long lost wilderness friends that, man, I'll get a cat, I'll get a dog at home.

Speaker 3:          01:03:31       I love them. Like, cool. But at the end of the day, now it's an animal and it's not a senseless senseless. Why assign it? Because I believe hunters or hunters that augment the most compassionate people that you'll ever meet because if it is a hard thing to take an animal's life. But I know it's part of the process, you know? Um, it's not like I'm just thought, let's just go and kill an elk got killed. I'm totally not that hunter at all life. Nothing turns me off more. I'm not that sort of person. I'll have a quiet time with that. You know, the animal. I'll put my hand on it and everything and just be thankful. I know it's an animal. I know the meat's going to be used. I know I'm doing the right thing, but it's still. That's the human emotion part of it, you know, and that's what, in a sense, that's why I got upset when I killed that bull elk.

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       You know, it, it, it is a beautiful creature. I understand. That's definitely a beautiful creature and it's a hard thing to do, but that's the food chain. Well, it's also very sustainable. And what's interesting is what you're doing is you're dipping your, your body, your mind, your feet into the wild world. That elk is going to get eaten by something. Yeah. If it's not you, it's going to get eaten by that bear that was sleeping on the carcass or nothing goes to waste of. I completely understand that after hunting, after getting so far in the hunting, I completely understand that nothing goes to waste. Nothing ever. If an animal breaks his leg, it's something's going to take care of that. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's just all part of the cycle. It's all part of the big picture of the world. The biggest, the biggest creature on the world is the world itself. If phase off everything us the way or even part part of the world's Pri. Yeah, and in a way, yeah, definitely becomes this super complex system that has everything in place. It's got a system to dissolve bodies and the bacteria dissolves what the animals

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       don't eat and there's just this really complex pattern that's in place that's been in place forever and what you're doing as a hunter is is going into it and becoming for a brief week or so, you're becoming a part of that system or that's how you acquire your or a month for you and you're acquiring your food that way, which I obviously and you obviously think is way better than going to a fucking monster and hiring some supermarket hitman to do the work for you and feeling that your guilt free. I worked at Abbott was for some time. What is that? A abetour is like a slaughterhouse. Oh, Aba in Australia. You ever heard of that? I think it's might be an Australia is a very secluded here in America. Will have just know that. Yeah, we wouldn't know. We don't know too much about you other than like Crocodile Dundee, crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       A land down under. Sometimes I'll use a signing or say something unlucky. You understand that word or not? How about tool waterhouse? So is that normal? Spanish, central, Spanish, central. Stria bitch. Spanish speakers. Is it a Spanish word? Must Be. Huh? Interesting word. I'll just start cooling the slaughterhouse and so 7,000 shape would go past on a chain and I just had the one job to do and and, and they'd be 700 people. You're making a slash, is that what you did? Yeah, just cut their throats. They would be 700 other workers just on the slaughter floor pot. So that meet with passing 700 people's hands. Males the whole lot for A. I'm not saying there's nothing wrong with this because the population of the world demands that not everyone can hunt now, so I don't have an issue with slaughter houses or anything like that, but I'm saying that might goes through a wide different process.

Speaker 2:          01:07:06       I'd have to say for a better word. Brutal process where those animals get hurt on to a, uh, like a truck, like a semi trailer, uh, driven to the lord has putting small yards pushed through a gate to go past all those people's hands that, uh, that uh, cutting the meat. That's before it even gets to the point where it's going to get cut off for packaging. And then obviously it gets sent out to different grocery stores and then sold from there. My mate passes these hands here. That's it. That's the only made the deposit. I'll get to inspect every single animal in its natural form because on the one that kills it isn't strange that that's the norm. The norm is a slaughterhouse and that's only been around for a couple hundred years for that. Everybody did it. The hardware. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. But yet we seem to be.

Speaker 2:          01:07:58       The outside is for doing it like that and it's like this is so much more natural. This is friggin beautiful. That the process is actually beautiful. Once you get the knowledge and you look at it that everyone thinks, oh, you had to get an animal. She didn't have clean of these together an animal like it's clean. It's not a messy job at all. Um, and, and there's no, like I've got to block my nose. I don't want to smell them. There's no smell, there's nothing. This is clean meat and that's what I'm saying. The blood on my hands at that point is clean. Wouldn't bother me to eat a chocolate bar and lick my fingers after

Speaker 1:          01:08:31       you can. Maybe you can eat the meat completely. Exactly. Ready to me a predator. I mean, the only thing you have to worry about is if you eat a pig or if you eat a mountain lion or something like that. You gotta worry about trick analysis. We don't even have that at home. You don't have to else? Nope. And so you can eat your piggery rare.

Speaker 2:          01:08:46       Uh, you could, you definitely could. That's so come here and they cook Bacon and it's like crusty bit of cardboard. I'm sure you do the same. Well, I didn't know that. So I cook them some bike and for our friends that we stayed with Ed and K Westbrook there on that bear hunt with us it nk and um, I'm used to just having my bike and like slightly cooked so I just slightly cooked it and put it on the plate. I had on my bacon, they didn't eat their bike and I'm like, oh, they mustn't be big bacon. He does. And then after the fact that I've eaten my bacon, thanks Kay. She's like, yeah, we really liked to cook your bacon. Well because a trick and hostess and I'm like, what the fuck? Like you let me know.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       Was it much less of a concern with domestic pig? Yeah. They actually lowered the temperature that you're supposed to kill a or cook rather a domestic pork. Yeah. He used to be 165 degrees, which is what they recommend you cook them. Bear at and now it's 140. Yeah. So you're okay. I'm okay. I should be cool. They don't want to ever get out. I mean, unless something gets to them the way you get tricky gnosis by eating something with trichinosis, the horrific nature of pig farming of domestic, the way they raise it, these factory farms, it's, it's horrible. I mean, it really makes you never want to eat pork again. It's definitely really disgusting.

Speaker 2:          01:10:02       Yeah, I could. I'm just happy fill in my freezer with. We've naturally harvest mate. One hundred percent key. Make the kids eat it. They all love it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:09       But isn't it interesting that what you said earlier that everybody can't do that?

Speaker 2:          01:10:13       Not do it. It's bizarre. It is bizarre. It's because of what we're talking about. Everyone's, you know, you've got to have this job, you've got to make good money. You know, you need to be successful in that type of life. You know, that that's the big push. But, but I'm always like, no, you really need to be successful in this type of life, which is the outdoors experience, you know, like, um, uh, before it ever been a good father. Like that's the sort of the worksheet or whatever. Who gives a shit? Leave your job the more if you have to go and do something that you enjoy in life, right, that's the end story because you're not going to get to your death bed and be like, oh, I really wish I pushed and got that better position at work or whatever. You're never going to do that. You'll. You'll always be like, I wish I did more for my kids, or I wish I went and climbed frigging Everest or whatever it is. That's what it's going to be, but we don't get caught up in this trap is now I've got to have the newest car, the the nicest house. We need to live in this suburb. I need to be the CEO at work. I need to do that sort thing.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Well, I think we're set up with this desire in our heads to attain things that we think are difficult to attain. That we see. Like we see a shiny car and we see a beautiful house. We see it all the, all the different trappings of modern society. We see those things in there. They're very appealing to us and they seem to be like goal posts of success and then if we can reach those things, maybe we'll we'll reach more happiness or we'll feel better about ourselves. We'll have some status that that we can brag about and you chase that stuff until your hearts out track.

Speaker 2:          01:11:46       Yeah, I do the same thing. Don't, don't get me wrong. I'll say advertisement for a car or something like that and be like, I really liked that car, but then it's another party minute clinics and go, you don't need that frigging car. Why do you want that car? That car means you got to work longer or work more or something else to maintain or something like that. Or you want to go in and get that car scratched in the bush. That's another thing. You know? I'm like, no, I've already got a car. Just be happy with what you've got. You're, you're an idiot. If you go and chase that, you're an idiot. Just be happy with what you've got. Life's good. More out time, more outdoor experience. More time. If your kids more time for your wife, whatever. In that sense, you know, and it's, it's that said that that's the whole modern society thing. So indigenous Australia, not all of indigenous Australia, most of indigenous Australia because it's so young to our culture, you know, because Australia was only discovered in maybe jamie can look it up because I don't know exact date, I probably should. Um, they, they, indigenous Australia don't seem to have that desire. They just happy with what they've got and it's something to be, it's something to be envious of that, that, that they're just happy with that, that they're not going to waste their life going and chasing silly things, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:12:58       Yeah. Well, at the end of the day, those things that you're chasing, you can't take them with you. That's right. And even if you leave them behind for your family, I mean, they're, they're only going to enjoy them until they stop living, but will, will. It's like the masterpieces enjoying your life to the utmost and having the most, the most success with your family, with your friends, the most relationship, success, the most harmony with the people that you come in contact with. But that doesn't seem to be rewarded the same way in our world as someone who's got some ball or house, I fucking helicopter picks him out, but he's got golden underwear and. But that fight. Yeah, it does.

Speaker 2:          01:13:36       They can have that. I can have that helicopter and I guarantee that it fades and they want something new. There's something. There's something new that you're desiring past that. What I've tried to train myself to design and what I do desire now is experiences like worldly experiences coming to coming to America for the month. Man, I'd sell my if it meant to have to sell the house that I'm in Kingwood kill me. So I wouldn't know if I had to sell my car to come to America, America for a month, I'd do it, drop it 100 percent because the it's. And it's not even the stories that I'll tell you or cam or or Antonio or one of my friends back home. It's not even those stories. It's the stories within myself and the experience within myself. That's where the real value is. That's the real currency of this world is what's inside me right now and how I feel after doing this trip and this trip was miserable. I won't lie to you, but it's an enjoyable, miserable. How do you work that shit out? How could been in the snow? Being wet, flogging myself out for 16, 17 hours every day into the dark of night and getting back into the camp. Been miserable. How could that be enjoyable? Because the second you get back to camp, you're like, oh, a fire. That's awesome. Second you lay down yet I'm just like, ah, it's so good to lay down. It's like you've got to go through hardship to find the good shit in life.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       I went through this a five days on Prince of Wales island with Rinella and my friend Brian Callahan and it was raining every day. It's just pouring rain everyday. The hunt was unsuccessful, unsuccessful to. We didn't get a deer, but we came back and I was so happy. It was like, the sun is so warm. It's so nice. There's no rain and I've, I've, I this the same as it is today, which is beautiful. I mean it was beautiful today, but I didn't really appreciate it the way I appreciated it when I came back from Prince of Wales. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I really do believe that you have to go through some difficulty to appreciate good stuff. Like if you're born into like a super wealthy multibillionaire family and you've got a Ferrari when you're 16 and you know, you drive around, fly around everywhere in private jets and you live in a giant mansion. I just don't think that you can ever appreciate. Definitely not the difficulty I work for

Speaker 2:          01:15:51       what I've got today, you know, and then like I had a hard upbringing and stuff like that. My father was abusive, alcoholic, lived on the streets for some time and I really believe that put me where I am with my family. I absolutely adore my family. Do anything for my wife and kids, anything. Cut My arms off and sell them if I had to. That's because of the hardship that I had when I was growing up and, and lot my business is very successful today and I believe that's because I didn't have anything growing up as a kid. We Will Paul. We will. Very Paul, you know, we, we had nothing. We didn't, we didn't do christmases because there was no money to do Christmas and coming from a broken family like that to now have mine family that I don't know how to treat them right because of how we will treat it so wrong as kids and how my mother was treated. I know how to treat Kim or it's how unproven that, that shit don't fly in my house. This is how it actually is. You know, you love your family to death. You do absolutely anything for them. And the biggest thing that I'm proud of in life is having the family that I've got today. You know, like bowhunting aside, I'd man, I'd dropped bow hunting. You know how much I love bow hunting. I'll drop balancing for my family.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       Well, I'm not going to do it it. Kim's listening. Luckily, don't have to, but yeah, that is an interesting thing how people come from. A lot of folks that come from abusive, alcoholic families, they wind up being like really considerate. It really compassionate and really dedicated to keeping on the straight and narrow. You know, my friend Maurice, he grew up with an alcoholic grandmother who raised him and they used to uh, the ladies to lock them in a room and just leave them there. Why they would go out drinking and he couldn't get out of the room is no food. He was always hungry and never, never drank in his whole life.

Speaker 2:          01:17:43       I'm a nondrinker and it's just because of how I say my house St my father was drinking. I believe I wouldn't be like that drinking because I'm just like, I care about the person on the street. I don't even know that's the, that's the sort of person that I am. So I don't believe I would be, um, the violent drunk that my father was, but it's something I don't want to even promote to my kids. I don't even want to promote it to me friends. So all my drink and I don't need to drink. I'm silly enough as you can tell.

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       Yeah. I've seen that many times, man. People who grew up in that sort of abusive substance abusing family, they grow up and they're clean as a whistle and they don't have nothing to do with it. It makes total sense. Yeah. Tangier off it. Yeah. It's interesting how that works, man. Sometimes you have to see someone just fucking completely ruining their life in order for you to get it in your head. Well that is not me.

Speaker 2:          01:18:33       I just, I seen all the negatives in it and then I was like, I don't want any negatives in my life at all. Like I'll do anything to avoid them, you know, and that's why I keep on the straight and narrow and try and be a real positive person is um, I just, I just don't want any, anything negative like that in my life. And I've seen alcohol as being a negative burrito because people do stuff that they, they, they usually wouldn't 100 percent, but at the same time, um, I can be at work or something. And the guys are drinking and having a good time and there's no issue at all. She had all stay up all night with them having a good laugh. I, I just don't need it to have fun anymore because I've never had it. And, and, and obviously, you know, have been turned off it as a, as a young bloke. Yeah. I mean it's not necessary. I mean it's a social lubricant and end. I, I enjoy it, but I didn't grow up in an alcoholic

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       environment. I grew up in a violent environment and so, you know, domestic violence to me is a very scary thing and I couldn't imagine ever hitting my wife or hitting my kids are hitting

Speaker 2:          01:19:36       just, I can't, you know, it was like, it was so stressful growing up as a kid that I think that's why I've tried to live my life without any stress now. And having a business. My own business can be stressful, but I've, I've tried to grow up without having any stress and just to have a figure like that in your life growing up as kids. I've got two sisters as well that were obviously affected by, by it as well. Um, it's a little bit like feeding your kids the wrong vegetables and not feeding them life, but for mental health, you know, domestic violence is so ruining in that sense that, that it just destroys mental health. I've had, I've used it as fuel myself, but I know a lot of people don't and it actually affects them as they get older. It affects them more and more.

Speaker 1:          01:20:24       It doesn't, it also affects if you see violence too often in the car. And by the way, I should really expand on this. Like the violence that I saw was nothing. It means, you know, my dad hit my mom a few times xeno he smacked her around. I saw him hit some other people do. He's just,

Speaker 2:          01:20:41       that's alright. Yeah, that's, that's an, that's enough.

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       That's bad. But it's not violence in comparison to say he never hit me. I've seen many people who've lived way more violent upbringing way, way worse than what I've seen, but one of the things that happens to young people when they see violence on a regular basis is your brain gets programmed to accept, not just accept that, but to be wary of that and to be ready to respond to that. And so you develop a much quicker temper and your, the consequences of being in a dangerous situation become much more real and you're much more likely to act in a violent way. And when children see violence, you see people getting hit and they see that kind of shit on a regular basis. The norm, it becomes normal. It becomes an option, you know? And it's uh, it's just like programming. I mean, you know, you have, you have children, like when you raise a kid like they're so fast. It's so fascinating to watch kids learn and grow and you see what they respond to and you see like when you, when you can talk to them and get them alone and have fun with them and respond and rationalize with them. Like I try to talk to my kids, like they're adults. I talked to them like they're little kids, like I give them a lot of love and a lot of. But I try to explain things like they're really smart and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:22:01       probably I really like that my kids are like that.

Speaker 1:          01:22:04       Well, they, they get it kind of and, but they keep asking questions and we work it out, you know, well, what does that mean? Well, what, you know, we've had conversations about what to do if someone's being mean to you. Like my daughter was like, someone's being mean to me at school. I go, how are they being mean to. She was like, well, they said something mean about my hair. I mean, I go, well, do you like your hair? And she's like, yeah, I like your hair. I go, do you think they really think there's something wrong with your haircut? Or they try to make you feel bad. She goes, I just think they're mean. I go, well, it probably trying to make you feel bad. Right? And so why do you think they're trying to make you feel bad? While a lot of it is because when kids are little, they realized that they can affect someone and they don't.

Speaker 1:          01:22:40       Maybe they don't even understand that it's going to have a really bad feeling on you, but they, it's like a toy that they can play with. Like they can say something mean and you react and they realize it and this is something that people have to get through. I go, what you should do is realize that how that makes you feel and decide you're never going to do that to somebody else, especially not someone who's your friend. And so we have these like long conversations about feeling about communication. And then I explained to her always that whenever I tell my kid about something, I always say, whatever you've done, I've done it worse and I'm dumber than you. For sure when I was your age because she's very well. Especially my eight year old who is a, she's the middle child, but she's, um, she's a, she's very curious and very, uh, very interested in progress.

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       Like we talk about things like getting smarter or what you were. One of the things I always say is I go, you're way smarter than I was when I was eight, when I was eight. I was really dumb and I did a lot of stupid things, but also it was a boy and I think it was a little more reckless and impulsive and a little crazier, but I'm like, uh, so anything you've done, like if you don't tell the truth about something or if you blame somebody else for something that you did. I did it all. I did all those things so I'm not mad at you like it obviously worked out for me. I'm here, I'm alive, I'm healthy and have you so it's going to be okay. So no one's going to not love you if you make a mistake. It's totally a part of being a person.

Speaker 1:          01:23:58       There's no way to navigate this life without making mistakes. So by having those kinds of conversations with them, I think I alleviate at least some of the anxiety because kids are always worried about how you feel about what they've done. Like they don't want you to be upset at them. They don't want you to be, and I always like because even if you do something bad, like I still love you, so that's part of life. I fucked up still as an adult, as a 49 year old man. I still make stupid fucking mistakes in the end. It doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's just shit. You can get past. It's all good. Yeah. So good. Chill out people. Exactly. But it's hard to. Well, you know what, that's another thing that being in the woods and being in the wild, like when you see a fucking 11 foot tall grizzly bear sleeping on an elk carcass and you're by yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:24:44       Boy does like insults about a haircut was getting mad at each other on the playground. He was so fucking stupid. Like, look at this thing. This thing is could hate me. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that funny? It is funny. I think I mean again, like you were saying about how being in the woods and then coming back here like, wow, I could just hit a switch and I could. I think, you know, having that perspective and being out in the wild, he does. It's an one more thing that gives you this sort of a greater picture of how bizarre and amazing life really is. You have this thing. No use crying. I was built milk. Yeah. Yeah, we have that. I think we invented it. I think you guys bought it. I think we invented the lower wifi. You guys invented Wifi? I can't believe that one guy's probably American ex.

Speaker 1:          01:25:30       Pat Probably went over there, claimed Australia probably heightened for his taxes. Well, like I just live by. There's no use crying over spilled milk like it's happened. Like if there's even something stressful, it's done now let's just deal with it because it's done now. There's no use carrying on about it. It doesn't make anything any better than just like let's just deal with the situation. Let's just get beyond it. But it's so common to be upset about it and everybody else does it and it becomes a pattern. You see it and you know. I mean I'm guilty of it myself. I've gotten upset about stupid shit before too, but sometimes just a perspective thing and also sometimes it's a busy thing, like sometimes you become. I mean, I'm guilty of this. I'll do, I'll do too many things and in doing too many things, sometimes I get my stress level too high, like my base stress levels. Like there's too many things I'm managing all at once and then I can be irritable. Stuff that I shouldn't be irritable about.

Speaker 2:          01:26:24       Kim's design. Kim's got a little business pretty little potty and she gets so busy, she'll get caught out with at that. She'll get to the point and she's like, fuck, I've just got to slow down. I've got to do less. I've got to do less so I can actually feed in more things, but more things that I enjoy. And um, but at least she's got that outlook least she gets to that point and she's like, yeah, okay, I'm getting too busy, you know, I'm actually losing quality time with whatever in life that she enjoys. And um, I used to be the side of the business because I'd put it in these crazy hours with the business. I, I practically built the business so it could support itself and I can walk away and go bow hunting and, but to get to that point, I put in a few years of just, I'd be out, I'd be up until 1:00 in the morning and doing things for the business and trying to keep it growing.

Speaker 2:          01:27:13       And then how big do you want it because the more shit you have in life, in business, all those sorts of things, the less time you actually have in life to do the things that you want. All right. So I got to the point and I'm like, well I don't really want the business to be any bigger than it is now unless I get into some other managers and things like that. And it's just fine in that point. Okay. Stop. Because you've really not enjoying life anymore, you know? Let's just roll it back a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:27:42       Yeah, I've done that more this year. I used to do all the UFC pay per views and I used to do the Fox events too and I cut it back to only North American paper reviews. No More Fox and I cut it in half so I can blame bow hunting. Yeah, shit, I need time. That's part of the problem I was. I was telling you on the way over here that I really think I need to do a bowhunting tv show just so I can have an excuse to go more so I don't. I listen to it. I've got to go to work. Can't just an attendance dry it. Dude. You gotta to come in and hunting with me. You can only see it. Yeah. You can only see it as an online in China, but it's going to be huge. Yeah. I don't know man. This is A. There's definitely a a line that you cross between not doing enough and then doing the right amount and then doing too much and knowing how to pull it back. It's hard to pull things back though. Yeah. Most people they. They feel like if they're not moving forward, they're moving backward. If they're not doing more, they're doing less. Yeah. That's the human condition, isn't it? Well, it's part of this, uh, you know, go get them society. Especially in America. I mean, I don't know exactly what the attitude is over in Australia. Is that right?

Speaker 2:          01:28:53       And it's, it's different with different people, but I'll have an hour at home if it doesn't even have to be something I want to do. I can be doing housework on the house or doing something at work. It doesn't even have to be something that I actually want to do, but if I'm not doing something for an hour, I am bored shitless dude. Like hide the knives. I'm going to cut my wrist, like bored, bored shitless. Like I need to be doing something. And like I said, it doesn't even have to be something I want to do, but I have to have something to do.

Speaker 1:          01:29:20       One of the things that I realized how to do or learned how to do over the last few years, it's going an actual vacation where I go and I could just sit on the beach and drink Margaritas and put my feet up because they play with my kids. No, I can't go fishing though. Well, we were organizing a trip recently to Hawaii and I was saying I forgot all the NIH. I can have access to exactly who god was shine, but the problem is I'll be up at 6:00 in the morning. I won't see my family. It's like they're at. Oh, it's not. That's not a. that's not a vacation your vacation. But fishing is like fishing is easy and they liked my kids like it. It's fun bringing, bringing kids to Australia to. I'll take you out in some mad fishing network. Australia is a strange place, man, and this is one of the things I was a 16 hour flight away. Well that too, but it's also a strange place in that like what they've done in America with reintroducing wolves. What, what they've done in Australia. What I think is really bizarre is feral cats and foxes to deal with some of the.

Speaker 2:          01:30:25       That's some of the shit never works to grow it. Rabbit's tail. They brought wrap to fade one of the early colonies within Australia because that was for the paypal, a rabbit's with paypal. The height.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       Yeah, that's why I brought him in. Food source. Well all the animals in Australia, so particularly New Zealand, all the game animals, all of them have been introduced from somewhere else. That's, that's great. Most so. The spaces are all gifts from royalty

Speaker 2:          01:30:47       along the way and. And then you've got other species that weren't gifts at all. We just brought them in because we thought it was gonna benefit Australia, but most of them, if not all of them done the complete opposite. So they grow it in the Fox to look after the rabbit. Well there's so much other shit that the fox would just prefer to eat that's easier than catching a rabbit. They just hate that and that's it. It's all. It's like the spaces that lives in Australia, like it's not like, oh, it's something else we want to get rid of. No, it's something else we wanted to keep because they're natives, you know, like ground nesting birds, you name it, and then you spend enough time out in the woods and you'll see just about the craziest things. And we've seen feral cats now because the birds started nes than out on lakes on old trees that were growing into like, that'd be safe there right now. The feral cats were swimming across the lake at night. We're actually seen this, the light swimming across the lake at night, climb in these birds that are nesting in the trees out on the lake and snatching the chicks and the bird just devastating to, to our population of um, I've

Speaker 1:          01:31:52       never heard of feral cat swimming and allies. He did. Yeah. So they just figured out how to do it. I just figured out how to do it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       Made me body threat. They will bomb them up, you know, that's, that's the, that's the is the point right there. That's the right thing to do is get in and Carlos cats out when it's to that, to the, that sort of. Well, that was what I was going to bring up because when I was in Australia, you gave me some of your, uh, Australian bowhunting magazines and these fucking pictures of hosing with cats. They've got a dead cat. That's a proud moment for her because of had devastated. And I, ah, I understand. I get it the same way coyotes are here in the lawn and it up. I'm not thinking about shooting me. Cut It home. That's different. It's a cat. It's got a collar on and it's got a bill on and it stays at the house. But isn't that bizarre? Like you love that cat.

Speaker 2:          01:32:40       Another cat. You'll shoot dogs dingoes and you've got feral dogs and feral dogs that just, that's just a domestic dog that's gone wild and they're the same. Now we'll kill that. Devastating to our population of wildlife. Wombats take good. Hit it. You know, kidneys will get harassed if sending a kid. No Kid, no kid, no. What is it? It's like a porcupine, but hate. Cool. Whoa, Whoa, it looks cool and you'll walk out there. You have wolves. You don't even have. Whoops. Goes, I think I would eat a wolf hall. Oh, how dare you. That's so not true. How big is the Dingo? I'm not as big as a wolf.

Speaker 2:          01:33:24       I'm bullshit and you know, but it's crazy because you guys are so scared to coming out to true. You could snakes and spiders and I'm in the Bush here for one day and there's a giant frigging Grizzly Bay. Look at my tent and I'm like, I'll take the spot. Isn't snakes please? Do you think it grizzly bears carry than a Croc? Crocs. Crossfit gets a cold, cold. Hard killer like that would just it. It seems if you went in the water near any crocodile had come and have a crack at you. If you went near any bar, reckon about 50 percent of them, 40 percent of them might attack you. It might even be less than that where it just seems like crocodiles so stuck in the Jurassic period that anything that comes to that water's just going to get chomped. I tell you a quick little story, so I'm in Arnhem land last year.

Speaker 2:          01:34:09       Honestly. It's like northern territory, Arnhem land on them, on them, but how are you spelling that? It's I am heights a h, h, h, h, h, h. like when we say h, h, h, you guys put an a in there. Probably not ask guys. Just me. Nigga from Arnhem. Arnie, Arnie homeland. Okay. There's a vast wilderness area, or is. It's God's land. Beautiful. Okay, so you're an for an outdoorsman. He was hell. Absolute hell for any city slicker. It is out there. Ms Dot g dot. Hello. Got a picture is amazing. Yeah, it is a spectacular and virtually untouched.

Speaker 3:          01:34:59       Yeah. That's the crazy thing about Australia is the population that you guys have essentially the population of Los Angeles in a place as big as the continental United States. Think Cross for that. Yeah, it's nice. It is nice. Even when we went to like you go to a nice city like Melbourne, it's beautiful. Yeah. That's like a little country town for you guys. Yeah. All it is. It's tiny. It's like boulder, Colorado and we're like, get us out of here. There's too much traffic. So uh, you're in Arnhem land and what? Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:35:28       I mean Arnhem land and shoot these massive big boar pig and it runs down. So I shot it and it just ran down. It was just on the edge of the water and it's fighting like it's seconds away from dying. And um, I walk over there and as I walk over there I sort of sit down and just give the animal that's piece, you know, I don't want to give him an adrenaline rush or anything like that because it could take longer for it to die. So I would just sit down quietly and snap Massey big salt water crocodile, just lunges out of the water and grabbed these pig and stopped swimming out across this river. I was seconds away from walking down there and essentially dragging that pig back

Speaker 3:          01:36:08       bank a bit. So I get photos that crock was sitting right there, like within seconds

Speaker 2:          01:36:13       is that crocodile was sitting on the edge of the bank or just under the water where it could grab that pig. That's how quick it can happen. People, we'll walk down and go, I'll just be quick. I'm just going to wash my face really quick. It's always hot there. So the most appealing thing in the Haiti's like you say water and it's like, oh well water go down there and just kind of splash a bit of water on my face and arms will be real quick gone and they go for anything, for anything. So I don't have a. They don't have a reluctance to kill people at all. Definitely not. And then um, there's.

Speaker 3:          01:36:42       Oh Jesus, this elephant by the nose. Well that's not a stride is buddy elephant. They. Yeah, that's a Nio crock. They guys your Pyros Jaimee crocodile. I think the same animals. Yeah. It's the difference between the crocodiles in Australia and those fuckers. Those fuckers are in Florida now. Assholes in Florida. Florida is just overrun with assholes. Not Everybody's filed on day. If you live in Florida and you're a nice person, I appreciate Davao and legend. Yeah. I'm. The crocodiles in the Nile. Crocodiles have been in, introduced to Florida. Assholes have just released into the everglades. No, it's not. They have a shoot to kill. It's not. I'm being sarcastic. I was being sarcastic back. They have a shoot on sight, a order literally seeing Nile crocodile supposed to kill it on site because they're terrified of him developing a sustainable population because the crocodiles they have, the native crocodiles in Florida are small, but they're very aggressive.

Speaker 3:          01:37:41       They're way more aggressive than alligators, but they're smaller, but now they have these fucking nial crocs. We got just absolutely savage and just swallow a person hall. You're talking about the everglades, which is just overrun with things for them to eat, so there's a high of them achieving a large size. Where did they get that idea from? The assholes. People have them as pets. The same thing as pythons. You know the python situation in Florida that people have had to have them as pets and then release them into the wall. Had I got there, it would get too big and they go, fuck this. I'm going to let a kid, hey, you little crocodile, go out and enjoy the wild and they think they're doing the right thing by releasing this thing into the swamps and then, well, they have a breeding population now they have a breeding population of Nile.

Speaker 3:          01:38:25       Crocodiles in fucking Florida sent back to the Australian introduced species. It like, it didn't stop it at foxes. I kept making these mistakes. You know, the cane toads, we have a lot of trouble with the cane toads now. Keen to cane toad. What's a cane to virtually overtaken Australia. They're going to have their own businesses and run for parliament and everything. Eventually like towed or opening your hands like a pizza. Freaking oh, not a pizza. Oh my God. As a cane toad. Whoa. That thing's huge. Bunny rabbit, they got these glands on their back and it's got a poisonous toxin in it. Oh, that's great. And so our bird wildlife are snakes. I hate snakes. Snakes are protected in Australia by the way. You can't just go and kill the snake when you want and they've still got their place. They're 100 percent snakes and got their place in Australia, the snakes atum and these poisonous toxins will kill the snakes that'll kill that bird life that they had just horrific Jesus kroger the size, these things, so why don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure they brought him in to fight off a cane beetle that was eating now cane crops and there's that many other bugs in that that the cane toad would have been like, I'll just eat what I want.

Speaker 3:          01:39:34       What a stupid thing. Can't we learn? Well, people are very, very infant tile with the perspective on the ecosystem, like the idea that you could just, oh well we've got a little problem here. I got, well there's a little opening. I'll stick up a slot in there. Just shove a Predator in there and I'll fill that opening like they didn't consider all the other animals that this thing would eat. If they want to do something and what they should do instead of introduced and shit like this. See this, check your load for a cane. Toads, cane toads are great stowaways and can be easily transported and your goods and luggage when you were packing up to leave from an area where cane toads are present, it is important to thoroughly check that. Were that accidentally carrying a cane toad? They're not a good thing. Tasmanian Tiger?

Speaker 3:          01:40:22       Yeah, to the Tasmanian talk like extinct narrow, but they got the DNA from one guy, ray and juice something. Let's do it. Are they going to reintroduce one that I like white, but they should now if they wanted to introduce that, they wanted to take the DNA from a Tasmanian Tiger and reintroduce it when they have to have something that was like a similar animal in and reintroduce it. Possibly. I don't know how it works. I think I got that from Jurassic Park. Probably pretty true though. I think that's how they do it. Well then in that, what they said they were going to do with the woolly mammoth, like there was this Russian scientists that we're thinking about reintroducing the wooly mammoth and they were going to use the DNA from a woolly mammoth from some, you know, fossilized something or another, and they were going to combine it with the DNA from a regular elephant.

Speaker 3:          01:41:09       Okay. I think that'd be interesting. I think in some cases like that, you know, not trying to be God or anything, but that should happen. That's a good thing, right? Togare I think it's only extinct because of human interactions. Right? So out of night, I don't know either, but 90 percent of everything is extinct. Ninety percent of everything that's ever lived. It's like, where do you draw the line? Do we bring back dinosaurs, you know, when do we draw the line? That'd be good hunting. Ooh, tigger impact. Big Foot. Would you want the t rex? Um, if there was enough of them, what if they say is good? Imagine that because alligators tastes good. Well, I do. Yeah, I've eaten one. Yup. John Dudley kills them all the time. He eats him. Yeah, he's a slave. He's still there. He said that their tails like alligator tail, like the meat from them is apparently like more rich and protein than he like elk or Moose.

Speaker 3:          01:41:57       Really? That's crazy. We packing that into the back country is supposed to be like really good for you. Super Lean. Cook it quick sear it will her it alligator. So our crocodiles back home are protected as well. Oh Geez. This not tag or anything for them. You can't kill a crocodile. A crocodile. What they re like hate him. But city of kill something over here please. This, the city in the northern territory, which is all part of honestly and ne is, is Darwin City and the river runs right into the city and there's crocodiles right in there. So guys will go out clubbing or you know, drink and get drunk and think it's a good idea to jump in the river for a swim and Yahoo. And I'm now getting snatched. So they catch oles crocodiles and I release him like miles and miles away and these things come straight back into the science spot.

Speaker 3:          01:42:49       And they liked the, this is what I'm hearing about these bears, right? Like catch sleeves, problem bears and they release them were near on hunting. Unfortunately they catch these problem based and that release them multiply and then a week later they show back up to the same destination. Yeah. Crazy. They know how to get back. They have some sort of internal compass. One of the things about saltwater crocodiles, it's so terrifying. As a friend of mine was telling me that they were on some sort of a boat and they were like a deep out into the ocean, miles out and they saw saltwater crocodile swimming out there. And what, how, how far? He said yeah, I think he said he was something like three to five miles away from shore and it's fucking crocodiles just out there swimming by z probably could have probably gotten a great watch off or some shit. Fuck, it's a goddamn dinosaur hat. Look at that thing. Yeah, that's crazy. When came, came out and were up in Arnhem land and I was telling him about all the dangerous shit, you know, like a crocodile will, you know, there's crocodiles in any bit of water here you wouldn't even know and there'll be a crocodile in there and

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       how buffalo charge you're in charge here. And I told him about all the poisoners bushes and everything and at the end of one day we got, we got back with like half our light and because I didn't pack any food in, we had to catch fish every day or try and shoot some shoots eight. So we got back half an hour early one afternoon and we're like, we'll go for a quick fish, we're going to catch some fish in and we've got to get some, some food into us. And we walk out and it's stinking hot. It's like 56 degrees Celsius. They'd like sweating it out is like 1:10. That's probably even a bit higher. Yep. It's hot. And unlike how we might be able to swim in one of the rock pools, you don't want to swim out in the ocean because one of them crocs is gonna.

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       Grab a 50 slash 56. Oh my God. Jack it up. Baby 50. Oh Jesus. One 30 to walk in the park. One hundred and 32 degrees. Temperature drink and buffalo peers. Because you had to keep hydrated or die. What does it feel like to be out in 132 degree temperature? You get used to it. How the fuck do you get used to them? It's like, it's like that. All my guys are working with working that temperature or summer. You could slip that cooking. I'm at 115 degrees. Those birds dying around us. There's a little video where I've got like, it might be a frogmouth, our attorney our. And it's just that heart that it's just, it's on the grant, it's, it's out, you know, because it hasn't had obviously a bit of hto and that day and anyway. So we're going out and there's a rock pool.

Speaker 2:          01:45:21       I'm like, well, we'll be safe to swim in that rock pool, and the tide had gone out. We've got big tires like seven made a tired, you know, they're come in and out every day, and the todd had been in and when had gone out to the left, a bunch of box jellyfish in that little pool. Then the ocean itself where we'll fishing in or you wouldn't be able to dip your hand in the water getting stung by the box jellyfish box. Jellyfish will kill you. Oh, you're dead dude. That was a, that was a four and a half hour chopper flight out to get there because we did it in the wet season. You couldn't drive any of the roads. Um, I had to hire a helicopter to get us out there. So it would have been four and a half hours for a hell of a cop to come in and then four and a half hours back to the hospital.

Speaker 2:          01:45:59       You're dead in that time. You're dead in the first hour. Like it's, yeah, you've got to have your wits about you and that sort of country. So box jellyfish. What do they look like? They're the one that nearly clear. They like, fuck yeah, look at that shit and that'll kill you instantly, and that's the one thing I didn't tell came about and we get out to the rocks and all the crazy shit that I've told you, dude. That's what would've killed us here if we jumped in the water. Like, Nah, let's just jump in for a quick dip. Wow. Who's that? Mad boss? That's that crazy fucking river monsters. Wow. Look at that one. That got that guy's leg. Go. Go back to that leg picture jamie. Go full screen on that man. That's sick. Tighter. I think you keep that person. Just get close enough to the

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       knee of the water again. Is it like an antivenom? Oh, is that a baby? Oh God. Damn. One year old. Oh my God. That's will Smith was in a movie or a diabetes organs at the end of the movie and he's going to. That's how he commit suicide. He's going to jumping up off with box jellyfish. What fucking movie I am. Legend. Scary Shit. And I am legend. It is kind of. I mean, there's so many monsters that exist. Seven pounds, seven pounds, seven pounds. What does that mean to you about. I think that's the one with the kid. The kid. Kid. Isn't that the one where he's poor? Like he becomes a successful person? Oh, I don't want to say that shit. I'll get that fucking thing away from me. Oh, he actually does kill himself, so he actually does any tips of box jellyfish in the water of human? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:45       Get out of here. I don't want to see this shit. Get you coming out. Get the fuck out of here. That's a movie. He dies with box jellyfish. That's a retarded. No, get the fuck out. They're not even that big. Jamie. I don't want to say it anyway. When you come out. I wouldn't take any of those and there's so many things that killed. We'll take him in the ocean. Then the things that kill you because they want us to live in Australia. It's true. That's what I always think about work because it's so freaking hot. It's so desolate that it's like, it just wasn't designed for people is part of the earth. No, I think. Well, people didn't live then, so didn't balance it out at some of the oldest earth on earth work that people didn't live their western dummies, like uni white people.

Speaker 3:          01:48:31       We definitely didn't. The indigenous people that lived there, I did that. I lived on the mainland and um, there's actually some really interesting areas out there. It's called the dampier archipelago in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and there's over 70,000 a rock in the area that I still don't know this. Maybe you can solve it, but 70,000 rockets in that area. Wow. Kangaroos, sea turtles, creatures that don't even exist anymore. When you look at the picture, you're like, was that a real animal? That drawer and all that. I just like, ah, I just got to fuck her. And so they don't even know whether or not it was a real thing because it doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't exist anymore. Wow. Yeah. Well, the, the kangaroo thing, we were talking about that before the podcast, we said we're going to show this video. Um, I did not know the Kangaroos were protected.

Speaker 3:          01:49:19       Like you can't just shoot kangaroos over there, all about naive animals. You can't have any event. 90 animals in Australia, everything we can hunt and there's 27 or 28 spaces are old introduced. They're an invasive species, like a feral pest. That's why we're allowed to hunt them. It's not like the American system where your hunting unite is lucky at what tile and oak and everything like that. And that's why we don't have a tag season. Well, we don't have any, any, any seasons at all in New South Wales. They've just introduced this season in the last couple of years and there's one species of d in Victoria, the lower part of Australia where you need to tag for. That's it. All those other species you don't need a tag for. And there's no season. What species have a healthy body? You need to type for those. Oh, there's not a bunch of them and they're trying to manage them.

Speaker 3:          01:50:09       It's really good. What they're doing, they're doing a good job. Mm hmm. So the kangaroo thing. I had no idea that the numbers of Kangaroos were as high as they are. So you were telling me about this. Looks like a kangaroo plague. And then Jamie pull the video up and this is fucking insane. Just Google kangaroo plague Australia. And what you see is something from a fucking horror movie. It looks like thousands of Kangaroos. I mean I have no idea how many of their head they're just running across this field. Like ants. I bet you have that. Analysts. I wouldn't cheeses. I mean completely insane when you look at that video. I have no idea. Yeah. So fuck a sign. The sign people that are lucky, you can't call the Kangaroos, you know, you can't hunt the Kangaroos. You can't shoot the Kangaroos. Kangaroos are a deer species, right?

Speaker 3:          01:50:59       I don't think so. I think they're like a marsupial. It doesn't have a near. Okay. I think. I think they even taste like deer. They taste good too. The really rich red. Meat's super, super lean. A lot of the lot of the body builders and stuff like that. Love kangaroo meat. When did kangaroo start getting joked? Yoked up. They always had big muscles. They've always had big muscle. We didn't see that in America until recently. Not really. Internet over the last few years has showed us a choking each other. Hey, say they doing weights and shit and pumping. It looks like they're fucking giant. Yeah. There's a video of those two kangaroos fighting one kangaroo. Chokes. You conscious? Look at that kangaroo. Just normal. Like, come on man. That's incredible. We never saw kangaroos. Yeah. So that's. That looks like a big red. Kangaroos are. The red ones are the biggest ones, right?

Speaker 3:          01:51:48       Yep. Yeah, the huge. My friend Eddie was in Australia. He does a. he's done a bunch of standup out there and he was out there with some Australians and I forget what the store. Look at the fucking dentist even. Look real man does not look real bitch. You and arm wrestle. Fuck that man. So that was what would happen with Eddie. He got out of the car for some reason and he saw this kangaroo and he thought it was a statue because it was so big. He thought it was. He thought it wasn't really so he was like seven feet tall. It's like there's no fucking way. This is a real kangaroo. He literally thought it was a statute because it was sitting there and his friend started screaming, get back fucking car, and the thing turns around and looks at him, and then he realized that this giant thing in front of them was an actual kangaroo and apparently they're very aggressive.

Speaker 3:          01:52:35       They're calling as a life feel threatened now. They'll kick your stomach out because what they do is they latch onto you. If they close. I've actually got a real big claw. They got clothes like that. Yeah, and then they balance their cell phone, their tile and like kick with both legs and they got like a single toe nail that's like that thing that has legs and that does not look real. And the balance that way on their back tails and credible out balancing their Bechtel's now kick with both their legs and then look how he's like balancing himself. That's so strange. Strange animal. God that is a flex and come up. Might come down to 100 pound ripped kangaroo crushes metal. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:53:22       He's bending cans. Look arms and this motherfucker is so strange. They are cool animal on the farm. When you come out to Australia, you'll see. You'll see a kangaroo fights. They do it all day. Everyday. Shit out of each other. Yeah. They always choke each other out because some new shit. Are they learning how to do this? I'll spinning back, kick their fucking chest. He wants to pitch a piss. I wonder if we could take a leg kick. I always think if I was going to fuck with a kangaroo, I would just arm drag him and take his back. I bet if you take us back, I didn't know what to do. Oh, I don't know. Take his back out and find out and choke them. We'll test it out when we get there and he'd some fit clothing like Kevlar to where it can't cut your guts out because you know, probably won't even go for your face or I'd probably go for your guts.

Speaker 3:          01:54:13       Got For you. Got Getting the guts. If you can protect that, if you could figure out a way to like move in, Juco them, fake. Um, get them to move. Get Ahold of one of them, pause arm, drag them back because y'all going to be awesome. It'd be on the news. My Dad and tries to take on a kangaroo's it ain't gets his stomach kicked out. This is how I die by getting. There's a bunch of these videos of these kangaroos choking each other out. I've never seen him choke each other out. Oh, there's a great video. Um, these two kangaroos are fighting in like a suburban neighborhood and they're in a street and one kangaroo Canberra. He gets like a, like a, what we call like a vice grip clamp. In jujitsu you would use or wrestling, you'd like clamp, you scoop the back of someone's neck like this with one arm.

Speaker 3:          01:54:57       And the other arm comes down and he clamped down like this, this is it. And he fucking chokes him to sleep. This has got to be Canberra for see if he could fight this. I don't think they just start kicking each other's asses, but they're in a like a regular neighborhood fucking each other up. But see if you fall, you call the tight. This shit. I should. But it's all the standard moves. It's very a sock. 'Em robots. Look how they snap each other's heads back to two good buck there. They only go for the guts. Oh look at that move though. I like how they balance on that. Tail it. It's really crazy. See if you can find kangaroo chokes out other kangaroo because he puts him to sleep like literally the clamp down on them and it turns his neck like it's another thing we invented in Australia.

Speaker 3:          01:55:46       Checkouts, Kangaroos, tinder. People learn from Kangaroos. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe someone actually saw in school to the Canberra. I bet people didn't know that you could choke people out until they saw someone do it. Right? Yeah. Here it is. So he, they, they start going at it and one kangaroo is cv could find out where he does it. He gets a front headlock, see the one kangaroos kind of being a pitcher. So here it is. She's got the clamp, we'll get it clamped. He gets a hold of the neck and he's bending his neck and a really funny way and he traps the head up against his chest. I mean this is like a Japanese necktie right here. And he grabs a hold of it and he's clamping down on it. It's not even like he's paying attention. It was like he's looking for girls, hey ladies got this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:56:35       Looting. I wonder if he's done that before. But that's his baby. So he, he clamps down on any holds it in place and the kangaroo fights for a little while and then Bam passes out. That's awesome. And is a bitch. What a bizarre bodied animal. There's nothing like them wake up. It's been so used to seeing these animals that same way to us. Uh, but when I think about it, I'm like, these things are on two legs. Yeah. What else is on two legs? Not. Have you ever seen a platypus? Well they kinda go on the front leg. Like look there. Yeah. When they're just walking along. But have you ever seen a platypus? Not In real life. A lot of posts is just crazy to look at it. Even for me and I've grown up with. Platypus. I used to be in the creeks and the rivers around home.

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       They were just so weird to look at and let the kid know and when I stopped thinking about as species, like the wombat, the wombat is just crazy. They're all over the farm. You'll see them everywhere when you come out. I'm like, just dig these massive big halls and they just the craziest creature you've ever seen. It's just like the big, big, fat stumpy rat. I know the name Wombat, but honestly I couldn't pick one out of a lineup. I don't really know what it looks like, but let's get to that kitchen. What is it? A kitchen now? What is it? How you say it, kid? No Kid. No Kid. No. I want to see what a kid is first. What's it Kinda just looks like a porcupine. Oh, it's better than a pole. He Paul and looked it up. You should jacked again. They've got this crazy big.

Speaker 3:          01:58:09       Only one a year again. Jamie, it's got a crazy beak. It's got a crazy big sniffs out like ants in an ant mounds and it'll dig out the answer. It'll go. It'll dig out and logs, sniffs them out and just look at that dude. Yeah, that's a kidnap. Me and the kids would just um, there was one on the road the other day. Yeah. It's got a peek. Yeah. Like that kind of. That's definitely better than a hedgehog. What's that thing? Get rid of it. Come on bird. It's got a beak. Like a bird. It's pot sick. Awesome animal. Look at that. What a fucking bizarre. A little thing. That was one on the road. Digging the Alvin. I owe a lot of the month now because I've been away for so long and a main. The kids, whenever we see them on the ride, we will move them off the road and the kids got out and, and you can actually hold ice box is super sharp, but you can actually touch them because it's taken up so much room on your hand, like, you know, there's 100 spots and they chain you can actually touch them.

Speaker 3:          01:59:13       And uh, we, we moved this thing off the road and, and I, and the kids were even normal about it. I like, oh yeah, cool kid. Now you know, because they've seen them 100 times and I was like, anyone that wasn't from Australia though, that was saying this for the first time, this animal with a beak, when I started thinking about it and they turned back clothes like the clothes turn back like that. It's for digging, right? Crazy. As animal in the world. When you think about it in that sense, you know, if you'd never ever seen one before and you come across it for the first time, you'd be like, Whoa, look at this thing. This thing is crazy. Yeah. It's like a porcupine. Fuck the duck. Right? It doesn't have a beak that's not a bad guy. Platypus. To their daily lives. But there are a mammal.

Speaker 3:          01:59:51       Yeah, and they got like a big duck. Big. It's crazy. But the laying of the eggs, it's so strange. Like what is that? They've got a poisonous spark as well. They do, yeah. Where is it on the night of them? Might be like a anal spark or something like that. Mm hmm. Yeah. Interesting. So it probably wouldn't want to play around don't finger. It's, but just the wide variety of animal life is very weird. It's very weird. When you think about how many different things, and then again what you were talking about about the introduction of foxes and cats. They all fit into a system. Like look at that thing. There's A. Yeah. So it as like this funky kind of furry beaver looking tail. It has the tiniest little dots for eyes. Webbed feet. What? Have you ever eaten beaver? No. Had beaver with Rinella. It's really good.

Speaker 3:          02:00:45       Really delicious. It tastes like beef. I didn't like the sand event. I know. I wouldn't either. I wouldn't have normally even thought that you could eat it, but uh, he, he killed one and then a braised it and then slow cooked it and it was like a pot roast with like potatoes and carrots. It was delicious. Thank the bear camp. I could never ate a beaver because members of dead babies and bear camp. Oh yeah. It's the thought now. Really? Yeah. I couldn't do it. I could, unless I was slightly hungry. I'll do it slightly telling you if Steven Rinella cooked you a bowl of this beaver pot roast or whatever the fuck it is. They made. It was amazing. It was really good. It sounds good. It was like a, like a strange beef, like what an odd, like maybe dry age beef. Yeah. Like tend to me off again.

Speaker 3:          02:01:35       Yeah. Was like a beef from that was like, all right, this is beef from Nicaragua. Oh, interesting. It's got a different flavor to it. You know what I mean? It's uh, it's just, it's like it's reminiscent of beef, like a cousin of beef. That's what it tastes like. A cousin of the. It's very weird and it's kind of fatty and it's Kinda like tender. Yeah. Okay. Steve, we'll have to hook me up when I'm telling you you'd be shocked somewhere along the line they made it illegal to hunt them for food though they're a fur bearing animal, so you have to have a fur trappers license and America eat them. But there's people at the turn of the century like Rinella is amazing in his knowledge of the history of animals and America and the history of hunting in America. But apparently many, many, many years ago, um, beaver trapping and beaver pelts were so valuable that the richest man in the world in the early 18 hundreds made all of his money from beaver pelts.

Speaker 3:          02:02:34       Really? Yeah. We should bring that back in. Davis for law, I think it was before felt and once they came up with felt like for hats and stuff like that because the gentlemen war felt hats. They didn't need beaver as much anymore and beaver kind of fell out of favor and people stopped, stopped doing that to have big numbers. The beaver population dropped at that time, but yeah, apparently behind animals, you know when they've got that value on them and there's just an open slaughter is what seems to drive a lot of things to extinction. Well, that's one of the interesting things about America, like if you buy elk or venison in America, most of it is from New Zealand, which is really strange. The reason is you can't like market hunting. It was like a giant factor in the slaughter of countless amounts of buffalo, of elk and deer.

Speaker 3:          02:03:33       Even antelope, like they killed everything back in the day and it was a lot of men returning from the war at the turn of the century that just went on these trips and that was. That's the way that you could make money. That way you can make money is a go go hunting for meat and that's when they brought that to market. Yeah, I mean the. I think the idea of these animals being precious and preserved and wild life, the way we think of it, they didn't have these thoughts in the 18 hundreds. They were just. It was a resource and they just abused it and I just. I mean we've all seen the photos of the stacks of buffaloes. Yeah, definitely a lot of religious for the hides where we oxidize. Definitely. I think a lot of people think that still happening today, like hunt is a still that soda person. Whereas hunt is a. The ultimate conservationist now and the system that America has got in place is the best system anywhere in the world where there's a tag, there's a season, like they manage and regulate the population, so, so let's just say a elk. The numbers were down

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       the following year we'll. There'd be less tags available. It's as simple as that and that's why it's such a good system. In Australia we don't have that system in place, but in a sense it's pushed, pushed all the responsibility back on hunters. Like I can tell you now you Australian hunters are some of the best hunters in the world because they've got a conserve and they've got to manage their resources, their self. There's nothing in place to say, well, we're only given 500 tags away for that area this year. Um, because numbers are down, Hannah's as much as we are conservation conservationists, we're not going to go out and just slaughter the numbers. You know, they're, they're, they're an introduced species into Australia. They are bad to the environment. If the numbers are too big and Hannah's treat them like that, we were, we're not going to go and wipe out the whole population.

Speaker 2:          02:05:32       So, um, is a very good at, uh, you know, there's only 20 bucks in this area at the moment and there's [inaudible] there should be a certain buck to doe ratio. There's only 20 bucks in this area at the moment. We're not going to kill 19 of them. There's going to be one buck lift, you know, we're going to kill the oldest buck in that area. There's only 20. They will, let's just kill the oldest book in that area. That's a good population. Um, it's sustainable. They're not damaging the environment in that number. Um, and I think there's a big difference there between the American and the Australian hunter in that sense that, um, you guys would do the same thing. Don't get me wrong, if there wasn't a tag in place or seasoned in place in today's society would do the same thing.

Speaker 3:          02:06:16       I think I've learned from the past some, some would, but there's a bunch of people that wouldn't know that majority though the majority, but a, I think there's quite a few that wouldn't, you know, that's, that's a, I mean that, that is one of the, the main stereotypes of the hunter is beer drinking and shooting everything that moves and I feel today that it couldn't be further from the truth. It seems like there's more of the responsible hunter, the one that's got a good job or, or, or good business or whatever it is

Speaker 2:          02:06:49       that goes out and, and get. You'll be in the perfect example of that. I wanted to thank you when I first come on the show that the light that you've shown on hunting is, is how hunters are today. The majority of hunters are today. We're just not these savage kilo machines that are just like, yeah, kill it, you know, we're, we're very conservative in a sense. Um, you know, wow. It's not just about going out and getting a shot off.

Speaker 3:          02:07:12       If you are that sort of hunter, I believe you're in it for all the wrong reasons. It's about the experience, the connection with the outdoors that, that meet, that precious meat, you know, that you'd get off each, each one of those animals. Also the money that we spend on gear, the money that you spend on outfitters and trips that money in tags in particular all goes to conservation. Preserving the habitat

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       of these animals and a lot of these animals like especially like white tail deer. There's more white tailed deer here in America today than there were when Columbus came here and some of the incomes, all, some of these small towns rely on, right? Yes. Is very haunting and something that I've always pushed because it's frowned upon it in Australia in a big way because it's not the typical thing to do. Hunting's not. It's not definitely not. Definitely not. And it's. And it's not accepted like it is here in America. How did you get into it? Oh, you got myself into it, which was really, really weird. Hoyt were asking me the same thing. They lock off. So did your dad hunt? I'm like, no, you know, like I come from a broken family, um, I seen a barber shop in a store and I was like, um, what's that thing?

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       Because it was like a compound bow, you know, I'm like, what's that thing? And he's like, oh, it's a bow. And so I ended up buying the bow and when I bought the bow he gave me like, it was just a black and white magazine, like I was 97 and then I'd run around with like a fiberglass pole with a string. Been on it before and used to make my own arrows, like Robin Hood stuff, you know, but never had seen anything like that in the magazine he gave me was a guy with a massive big water buffalo on the front cover. And I'm like, you can kill things with this, you know? And I was like, the majority of people had never hunted, been like it like, so you can kill a rabbit with one hour, but if you're gonna shoot a buffalo must like take 20 Harris.

Speaker 2:          02:08:55       So I was like, at the time, I'm like, he must have shot it like 20 times or something like that to kill it. No rabbits got a pair of lungs above loads. Got a pair of lungs, you put an hole through both of those lungs. That thing's dead in the same amount of time. Well now I've shot a bunch of Buffalo, you know, and it's just like, that's the craziest thing, isn't it? It was just like it was a guy and a magazine with a buffalo dead. And I was like, you can kill things that and now unlocked this full blown hunter, you know? And it's just. How did, what was the process though? So you got to go. And did you take lessons? Did you teach lessons? Just taught myself with what year is this? Um, will all 17. I'm 28. I wish I was 2020 nights tomorrow.

Speaker 2:          02:09:38       And just to heat right? It's my birthday in Australia today, so I'm 30, 36, so I was 17 at the time, so it would have been 97. So it's almost 20 years, almost 20 years. You're dealing with very little internet back then, right? No Internet. No. So even though we invented Wifi, you guys didn't have Australia. We probably did. Like I said, I was poor. I didn't know, but you're not. My point is you're not getting any information. Teaching. Learn. Oh, your mistakes. That's what I was. I actually was a big part of a bow hunting for ministry for many years and I just like if I had that when I was coming up through boning the time, energy and money, that all would've saved by, by just getting the right information straight off the internet, like being able to do research or, or even us going to a club and there's, you know, there's 20 other guys at the club that you could at least information out of.

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       I never had any of that, but it's shit still got killed, you know. And that's what I always say to people. You know, you, you, you, you don't need the best of everything. If your budget can only afford you some raker bow and some cheap arrows, I guarantee you're still going to be successful with that gear if you put in the time, there's no doubt about it. Um, so I, I just had this cheapo cheap arrows, probably didn't even wear camouflage at the time and just went out into the outdoors and just worked it out myself. So, prearranged finders, free range finders. So how did you decide like where to aim? It was a guest. It was, you'll use, it was, you're using your own knowledge, you'll use in your own skills. That's what sucks about someone today's technology in that, because you lose that, right?

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       You're using a range finder, you're relying on the range finder. I still go out to the range sometimes where I'll just go around shooting clumps across or whatever. We've noted rangefinder. Guess the distance have a shot than ranger. Just just so you get to learn distances and know distances. Um, I'm pretty good at like 30 yards. 10 not released. I just did. Right. So you do with your fingers. When did you start using a release aid? Um, I don't know what year it was, but I'm 10 years in. Yeah, about 10 years in where you are making your own arrows. Who was making it like mine? Ours, our team. The arrows. Like you'd use team Barrows, the big tube light. Broader. You're saying timber, is that what you're saying? Timber. Timber like would. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So would arrows you making your own wood arrows?

Speaker 2:          02:12:14       Yeah. You're cutting your own dowels and the whole deal some guys did. You'd be able to just buy, you know, like 12 Dale's already spawn that old respond tested to say 80 pounds. And then you'd glue, you brought it on your lap in the front up. You'd glue your. Brought it on, you glued it on? Yeah. Equally you brought it on. No inserts. And then feathers. You'd use five inch feathers on everything and just fingers on the strings. Free figures on the string. No sites or anything like that. It was just one sided. It was very instinctive shooting or some guys would use the Arrow and line up down the road down there at the animal, but um, a lot of the times were effective out to 50, 60, 70 meters. If you did enough practice, you will still effective out to those ranges, but it took a lot more time.

Speaker 2:          02:13:01       Did you wear your arrows and where your broadheads way arrows and broader. So you've kind of kept him in a certain range. Yeah. You keep them all identical. You'd spin testimonial when. Why want you put your broad it on him? I'm good. You could get spawned as back in those days and you'd buy and test them and you'd turn your shop to get to the closest spinal. Wouldn't be perfect on each one. We're talking timber here and you get your spine pretty accurate on each one. You'd glue your. Brought it on in that sense. And yet. And your, uh, your knock as well. So everyone was spine the same. Up and down. Yeah. Wow. Two years. Sam. Pioneer. Simple. Oh yeah. That's a funny thing. Like a mountain man, trappers and came over here on beaver skin Qa practice a lot so I can go, I'll go, I'll get the height defiant there and all site that bow in and yeah, I can, I'll just shoot once a week or whatever, you know, if I can shoot daily I will.

Speaker 2:          02:13:58       But with traditional gear you had to shoot daily. You had to have either 50 or 100 hours every single day just just to keep the skill level up. Um, and it was same shooting a bow that was open sites, no sites or anything like that. And fingers. You had to constantly shoot that boat to be, to be accurate. So it's almost like throwing a rock in that you've got to kind of have a sense of how far it's gonna go with the amount of effort. Exactly. Like thrown a rock. Yeah. Where to pick it up so that if you know it's a certain distance away, you know, you kind of in your head know the arc of the era. I wouldn't get a new boss every year because I would walk. If you've got a new bow, you had to start all over again, whereas I knew the costs of that bow, you know, I know we're an RFL.

Speaker 2:          02:14:39       I know we're in our flat too. Um, but like I said, you hunting, I used to kill just as much back then as I do today with today's technology. But I've got to spend less time with today's technology. Well, you're also in Australia, which is very different because you were what you were saying. You can only eat brown. You can hunt all year round. You can shoot things every day. You could shoot as many animals as you want. Exactly. So you could go out and one day and killed 12 dear. And that's fine. You just take them and give them your friends. It wouldn't if you, you wouldn't, unless you were just calling because the numbers have got a badge. I'm lucky you could, you could, you definitely could get and it'd be no. And then you just have a lot of friends and just get given to me. He had.

Speaker 2:          02:15:23       Do you, uh, do you wind up giving a lot of your meat away? Heaps. He heaps, Yep. Um, I liked shooting a deer, why they fat so before they go into the rotc because they go into the rotc fat and they come out looking like a grey hound, you know, they just, they just lost so much condition. Um, so I like to shoot a couple of days before the Rock and um, they've also got a lot of fat on him at that point, which is really good for making sausages. I lock my command and sausages, I'll feel the phrase with that. And then I've just got a list of just family, like put friends aside. I've just got a list of family that will take the meat off me, which is really good because especially with the da that a lot of the teammate gets all used, some of that big mountain bowls and things like that. I'm not a big fan of eight. And then big rank bowl is, you know, it's just, it's super super gaming but still doesn't go to waste. It's doug made or it goes back in the mother nature right there. And then have you ever brined them? Like Brian, a board had going to try my buddy, Antonio does all that sort of stuff and he makes those um, like, like big cranks, sausages, like a cured sausage man. Delicious or some. Yeah. Apparently like

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       if you cook them well those old boards are really delicious. You just have to know how to like brine them and cook them. Well, the Europeans love them. Yeah. So we've got our professional like pig, his back home that hunt for human consumption. They make goes to humans and consumption and the majority of it gets sent overseas. Like they love it and they pay big dollars for it. Are they, how do they consume it? Like about sausage or anything I suppose. I think the whole, the whole animal gets shipped right, but I wonder what they, how they mainly eat it. Denying him the rod is a crazy thing man. And most people aren't aware of, but deer and elk and I guess stags, a lot of those other animals, they only have sex once a year, so all year.

Speaker 3:          02:17:14       But what a crazy design like nature has it set up. So most of the here, they're not even horn. Yeah. Yeah. Then one time a year they lose their fucking minds. It's just crazy. I don't drink. That's the only thing on their mind. Just go ballistic all day long. Sometimes all night long. I've never hunted deer in the Rut. I've only hunted deer, you know, in Wisconsin in season. And uh, in Montana we hunted deer and they weren't in the Rut, but apparently when they're in the Rut they lose their marbles. But I've seen elk in the Rut and it's the most bizarre thing kind of in control that tongue anymore. Just hanging out there. Dick is flopping up and down when they scream, literally they have a rod going all the time that isn't all over their chest. They're screaming at the top of their lungs.

Speaker 3:          02:18:02       It's a red stags. I put their head between their legs, look there in the. That put the head between their legs. They piss in their mouth, they hold the bolt in the mouse Gogol it as I tried along because my oldest brother, he goes all over their body. So I could imagine doing that before sex. Like, yeah, I just got to get these done by pissing my math is right. I got to get ready baby. You know how I feel about you off when that happens. Like they have prints in there and look, I'm king. Shit. Wonder what that's all about. Like what kind of evolutionary advantages there to pissing in your own mouth and spraying it up and regular we ever done that and then they're just like, you know, we're not going to write this bidding anymore because it's just drastic. We really don't need it.

Speaker 3:          02:18:43       It's not benefit. You'd get yellow teeth. You just lie on your shoulders with your ass up in the air. Just with his hold on the back of your knees. You've got a scoop them. Would it pull you towards a. it's hard, but it's awesome to say. I got to see the. See if you could find that. Is it a red deer? Red Deer? I think at Rusa. Dave won't do it. Two days. Super mediated it. They're the ones that roar like a lion. Yeah. What a weird fucking noise that is so painful that a lot of people don't even realize is deer in Australia. There's six spaces in Australia and they'll go out camping and now he that and they've, you know, they're like, oh there's a big cat in Australia, you know, like, cause that's like a bit of a myth, you know, like there's big cats in Australia and that's what makes it, a lot of people think of it, you know, they're like, we're scared shitless.

Speaker 3:          02:19:30       We couldn't sleep last night. And I'm like, where was, where's the spot? I want to know where the bodies, because I know it's a deer. Yeah. Well did you hear that? There was a rumor for like years and years and years. People had talked about spotting big cats in the UK and then they found out that there was a fucking sanctuary that released brands. Yes. They just admitted to it. Then in the nineties, I think the late eighties or nineties, they had released like a couple of Pumas in the UK countryside. So in this system is Puma Puma's? No, like the Sneaker Puma, like welcome to America. Oh, here he is. He's pissing. Oh yeah, like he's pissing in his fucking mouth. Oh, what in the hell? And he loves it. So he tried it. That knock it, give it a go. Uh, no. He's pissing all over himself. He doesn't even look like you're doing it for the fuck of it.

Speaker 3:          02:20:19       You don't think he's in the Rut? Not. There's another stag there. You should be beating the shit out of it, but he's a little one now. The other stag is big. He probably got to be real careful with that other dude. Are they not doing it right? A piston right in his mouth so he can go. Well, that's the thing in New Zealand, New Zealand, a lot of the stags or they're high fence. I hide it. I don't want to piss off some Honda's at Dewa, but closed range is against everything that I'm about because it's a fight currency for what hunting is. You get these massive big red stags and just crazy inches on top of inches. No one ever writes a. This is the close range stag that I shot in New Zealand. No one ever writes out, they're just like, oh, I've got a big red stag and I Blah Blah Blah and so many hunters that that aren't educated in that sense and I'm not having a stab at them from not being educated.

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       They shouldn't have to be in that sense. Looking at that cow and all that. That's what you can expect when you go to New Zealand or Australia. Now it's frigging they append animals and they feed them high protein, high protein food there. They've been genetically bred. It's just all that crazy shit that's the fight currency of a red stag in Australia and New Zealand, free range, red stags on like that. If you should afraid Ryan's red stag like that in Australia and New Zealand, that's going to be the record. That's going to be the absolute record. That's not the true. That's not the example of what you can expect if you come to Australia or New Zealand and hunt free range. Isn't that the. That's the difference between free range and fair chase and these high fence operations and it's very. It's a very contentious argument because a lot of people growing these white tail deer in America and they're, again, they're introducing this crazy foods to their diet and they're growing these ridiculous racks that don't even look like racks, like bushes growing out of their hat and they looked so fake. Yeah. I don't think they're ugly. They are ugly joy looking at it. I don't enjoy looking at it either. It looks weird. It's like some sort of a strange weird bred dog or something like when you see their antlers and you know there are 290 inch white tails, like what is that? It should because hunting should be so natural and that's so far

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       from being natural, especially when it's wildlife. Not talking about walking around with a stick and a string that you've carved out of a tree yourself. I'm talking about just a natural environment. Landscape and animal. Yeah, well animals that are living in the wild literally no interaction with people other than when the hunter and especially what you're dealing with because you're dealing with very few hunters and like expansive areas where very few people even go into. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't muck around and they see you and they're gone like that. There's no like, oh, that's what that dude might have food. Nice pocket over there. No feed. No. They're like, what? The goal is another big issue in America where they have these feeders and these people, they put a blind outside of a feeder and the feeder goes off at a certain time and these people sit in the blind and wait for the feeder go off because it near program to come towards the feet or when it's going off and you just whack them.

Speaker 1:          02:23:18       Yeah. I'm not interested in that myself, but I don't, I don't frown upon it. Like they call it biting. Right. Well what it is is it's like meat acquisition. It's not really hunting. I mean, it's probably better for the animal and they have put the effort in that set that up right and true about animals. So it's a little bit like, like I said, it's not my style of hunting, but that is the free range thing really gets me. I don't want to go on about it because I'm going to upset too many people, but I know what you're saying, but think about what you were saying earlier about your experience in Montana. You're, you know, 11 days in 12 miles deep into the woods by yourself. That's the real deal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that is as real as it gets. But this a thing about hunting where, you know, people that are really into bowhunting, look down on people that shoot with a rifle.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       People that are really into wilderness hunting and fair chase. Look down on people that hunt high fence. And I a, I get the arguments. Um, I even get the arguments for some high fence. Like friend of mine went to this high fence operation and taxes and I was like, man, that seems kind of crazy that these animals are all pending. He's like, it's 10,000 acres. He's like, defense circles, 10,000 acres. He goes, they put their on. Well the genetical, their access deer and all sorts of fun. Like Neil guy and all sorts of weird and foreign species. He's like, yeah, they have been put there, but they're, they're wild. They're Roman wild. I'm like, Oh man, that's a weird argument. Then because I get it. I mean like I'm not totally like if I needed to hunt for meat, it's a good way to do it.

Speaker 1:          02:24:47       Right. Even if it's only a few hundred acres, you know, the animals are there, you just go find them and get them for meat. But even if it's 10,000 acres, at what range is it really wild? Is it wild at 50,000 acres? Is it wired into wild at 100,000 acres? Like if it's fenced in, if there's a fence anywhere. For me it's just gotta be unfenced fence period. So when I went to Africa, I've got, I've got pretty stitched up when I went to Africa and it was because it's just like an operation, it's just an income for him stitched up. What do you mean by that? Stitched up fucked over. Oh yeah, yeah. By the outfit of there, like he was just, he was a con artist, bicycling. But um,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       I don't want to go into too much detail, but so all is supposed to go straight into the Zimbabwean hunt. Buffalo, Cape Buffalo and those are dangerous. Yeah. Before I got there, he took me to, he's like call them branches or whatever there and it's all that means is high fence operation in the South Africa and I understand parts of South Africa because it has bred animals that are on the brink of extinction and then it's good for them because they're there now, but it's just not familiar me that close range hunting and everything's closed range, you know, it's just, I, I absolutely hated it because I just want an animal that's, that's, that's there naturally, um, or has not been genetically bred or brought in or anything like that. And before I got there these guys were like, what size buffalo do you want to shoot? And I'm like, well, we'll just see what the big for the area.

Speaker 2:          02:26:13       Like that's all you can do. You can only shoot the big animal for the area if you're after an old animal or a trophy and we can't shoot what's big for that area. So usually I spend the first half of the trip understanding what's a big animal or an old animal for the area. Then you'll have it for the other half of the trip. They like, what size? Buffalo do you want to shoot? Well, let's just say what's big for the area. Oh No, we'll just bring one in on truck before you get here. You just tell us what size you want. We'll bring it in and release it. What the fuck. If I'm going to do that, I'm going to go to a farm and say, can I buy that cow and cut it up for me? Right. So, so, so that's a little bit on, on lease that operation in South Africa.

Speaker 2:          02:26:52       I'm not saying they're all like that. There's a lot of them like that. There is a lot of them like that and then I end up paying extra because I'm like, no, if I've got a hunt free range, it's the only way I'm going to hunt and that's what I was coming here for. 100 free range a Cape Buffalo. Then we ended up in Mozambique in another place where we didn't say a bowl for 10 days. The outfitter, he'd never been to that place or or he'd never taken a. have a hunters. They are or anything like that. And I got there and, and the whole time he was like, yeah, no, you know, this is a real good area. You'll tag are straight away. You will see hundreds of buffalo every day. And like I said, 10 days later we hadn't even seen a book. So, um, yeah, it was, it's, it's, it's a horrible industry over there in that sense. It's, it's an, it couldn't be a blame as well. I should've done more research on that outfitter. Um, but I, but I won that hunt for a charity auction. It wasn't the sort of thing that I was like, you know, research and for weeks and weeks trying to find a good outfit or to go through and shoot a Cape Buffalo so that, that was speed. Unfortunately. Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:27:55       There's an amazing documentary on it from Louis Theroux who's a wildlife or rather a documentary in from the UK. Great Guy who, um, who's been on the podcast a couple times and talked about it the first time. But uh, it's all about these African high fence hunting trips. And he was over there for a long time and got the guy to kind of explain exactly what's going on over there, but it was just really bizarre. See people,

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       you know they're there. They had these lions and they had them like right there. I mean there were, there was two cents of fences, one fence and the fence right behind it and they took a dead calf and they throw it over the fence and then watch the lions tear it apart. But you're looking at the lines of looking at the people you can go hunt those lines. They just, they just let one loose, they take it out and it's all high fence. But they were explaining that these animals were on the verge of extinction just a few decades ago. And because of these high fence operations, now they're thriving. But they're thriving in these bizarre conditions where they're fenced in and put them in the wallet and let them fry out there in that area. You know? And then there's the poaching thing. Poaching is a weird word for it because a lot of those people just hunting for food for people, the villages that I went for because we'd find snares and and I'd rip them down and it wasn't, wasn't the commercial side of poaching.

Speaker 3:          02:29:16       It wasn't locked out collecting the antlers or ivy or whatever and selling it and getting massive amounts of dollars. These were people that were snaring to try and catch animals to eight. Yeah. If I'm gone broke and my family is hungry, I'm going to be the first one. The fucking step over a fence and killed something I can tell you right now because I know I'm doing the right thing. Yeah, so there's, there's a funny line there where where there's a couple of different types of poaching, you know, and it's that one that's commercial and they just slowed her and everything. Elephants, Lionel Hollins, which freaking horrible. Then there's the villager, let's just call them locals because I lived there. It should be there land for people. Exactly. They just trying to feed their family, man. I come. There's no heightened that. No, there's no hate night and those people are shot.

Speaker 3:          02:30:00       They shoot the. I mean it's scary shit that is dead in South Africa, but goddamn racism is still real strong and a lot of areas there and those people that are just poor black people that live there. That's the other thing that I hide in the back of the hunt dude, the man and the people that I was with frigging rice. It's like I come back from that trip and talking to Kim about it and all choked up. I started crying. I can't believe what those people have to go through over there and now the paper that will help me on the hunt. That was small and now that will happy the whole time and he his these paypal's saying he would kill his own mother for the scraps from the table. Unlike had. How can you frigging say that day you say that you don't know that person?

Speaker 3:          02:30:43       That's how that is deeply ingrained generation after generation. I love the local people, but I hated the outfit that I was with. Wow, that's disturbing. And it's just sad that. I mean, how do you ever fix that and you know what's really crazy is for a lot of people that's their dream to go to Africa and hunt the big seven, you know, are the big five or or there's, there's a, there's a, there's a movement of people acquiring all these trophies going into Africa and shooting all these different animals and that's the way they do it. They go to these outfitters that can guarantee they can get in front of these animals. I think you've just got to do your research on outfitters.

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       Let's run with a scumbag ones out of the industry. Do your research on the the outfit or talk to other hunters that have been there like and not just one. Talked to six other hunters that have been at operation demand for the numbers or the emails for who their past clients and go there straight doesn't have that stray as built a hunting industry which is tiny. It's like, have you ever heard about hunting in Australia? Like, oh, come to Australia and shooter, whatever species of deer you don't because it's not that big. It's not like New Zealand or it's not like Africa where they build a big industry on it. It's not a New Zealand gets over like A. I don't know. They must have the right people or government pushing it at. Some people are always trying out. New Zealand's known for it. Yeah, beautiful country. Awesome.

Speaker 2:          02:32:04       But I'm. Australia's industry is built on having excellent access to excellent numbers of game. So. So if you book a hunt in Australia, it's not like someone's gone, you know, there's a big industry here, so let's just make up a business, a Australian hunton safaris and let's just get people in. We don't have game, but they're going to come anyway because we're known for hunting. You book a hunt in Australia, I guarantee you're going to be at a place as long as you do a little bit of research, but practically everywhere has big game numbers and that's why they've started the business on a hunting outfit because they've got so much game and they're like, oh, this is. This could work out really good for hunters. There's a ton of game here come along. So it's not like that in Africa, you know, a lot of those places have really got nothing, you know, it's, it's, it's arid lands and federal is bullshit.

Speaker 2:          02:32:58       That hunting is going to be unreal and it's, and it's not at all, which is what I experienced now, when, how many people who are willing to do something like what you did in Montana or what you and cam did in Australia was just probably even crazier because you didn't even bring anything with you while you have to predicate bringing that up. You guys survived off the land. I mean, that's how many days before I can. I, I just want to feel something up about that. The helicopter pilots said you've got to keep your gear basically to a backpack hunt because the chopper couldn't carry a lot of weight. So, um, so then I was like, well, I can't pack a lot of food because I'm already at my white limit cams already at ease, white limit. Nobody. Body islands already yet kind of be at his white limit.

Speaker 2:          02:33:40       So I simply couldn't really pack food. I couldn't pack fresh water or anything like that. Because the chopper actually struggled to get off the ground once it was filled up and so that's the story about it. Yeah. But those folks won't tell you that part of the story that might be like, oh, we couldn't take food because the chopper couldn't carry. They always look at them, didn't bring any food, any responsible. The Way Cam described it was like, you guys had just made this conscious decision to try to rough it. Oh, that sounds good. That sounds better. That stuff. It was pretty good. We did because I was like, it will be part of the experience. We'll have to catch buffalo, will have to kill. We're going to kill, come on. And uh, and we did. But that the buffalo that were killed was so tough. I think it might've been cans.

Speaker 2:          02:34:23       First bullet he killed was so tough that you just chewed the meat. You got the liquid out of it. And then you had to take the meat out of your mouth because you couldn't break it down. Yeah. It was an old bull, a [inaudible] book. He told me that he was practicing with his bow with the same piece of meat in his mouth for 30 minutes. That sounds about right now. What about the liver? I mean, couldn't you eat the liver? Uh, we could off. You'd want to check it over it. Most of Australians strikes, bases and game the disease. Furry, like that's one of the beauties in Australia. You can cut the raw meat off any animal in Australia and just ate it. You won't get sick if you do get sick, don't blame me, but you shouldn't get sick. Just like drink a buffalo. Piss. Exactly. Yeah. Um, yeah. Just, just, just so tough. But you didn't eat the liver room. We didn't take it. We should have. Now that you've said that. Yeah. I love liver. Yeah. Oh yeah. Touch. It doesn't mean he won't eat heart. You won't eat liver. He's a pussy. So he'll run like 200 miles. But why for seven, eight hours in a row you to live. That's not impressive. He just doesn't like it. I guess. Get a new shirt. Dude.

Speaker 2:          02:35:37       I just don't understand that. I think it tastes delicious, but it's also really good for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, and it's just, I think there's some sort of an obligation they eat as much of the animals. Yeah, I'll definitely, I'll do it. And actually a majestic thing like the elk or the, the indigenous population a lot. But when we go out there for a hunt because because that, that, that is free and a half days, four days drive from my house to, to go there to go hunting. Um, that's hot. Take meat that far home, you know, w, w what your, your, your vehicle, if you're in a vehicle is already packed up. And if you did the chopper thing, you wouldn't be taking any out. You'd have to donate it all to the indigenous. So when we go out for a hunt, I love it because we're shooting balls and cutting up meat and how do they cook it?

Speaker 2:          02:36:19       No different than any of us were. So how the fuck do they chew through that thing? If, if they're out on, um, if they're out of community, which is like a, like an outstation there on the land. You know, they're, they're, they're out on the land. Um, most indigenous cook just by putting the meat straight in the fire, you know, still very traditional way. They'd just put the meat. So like if I killed a wallaby or kangaroo, um, they, they, they wouldn't get it, they wouldn't scan it or anything that front straightened the fire like that and the skin's like a, what would we wrap meat in, like our foil or something like that and cook it in the fire like that. The skin just acts like that and it gives me a lot of flavor and everything like that. It's just why do we have to complicate things so much? Oh, let's put some air foil around it. Let's put some spices in there and stuff like that because it tastes better. Taste better because we're so used to doing that Monday. If you'd never done that, if we'd never ever done that meat with just taste good. Just how it is implying maybe or they figured out it tastes better

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       with salt and pepper and garlic salt. Definitely. Right. So there's like some spice company that's going to go through a indigenous Australia now given them more spices so that they get used to it and they'll get addicted sales go up. Yeah. So they throw it on the fire without gutting it at all. And then did they eat the guts? The guts, just the meat and everything around it that would probably eat the organs and things. Same with fish, just fried fish. Straight on the fire. I've done that plenty of times so it's good. Good. Eaten like that. And so it won't be scaled. And the scales act is like the protective barrier between the ashes and everything. Get into the good meat and cooking the fish. Better skills in all the flavor and taste and the juices. Once the fish is cooked then you just sort of watching the scale is often as beautiful, clean, clean, flush right there, Huh? Hm. Hm. That's interesting. I've never cooked anything on ashes like flat on Ashley will before. Okay. Yeah. You're going to need like a month in Australia. A month. Once a month. A month. Oh a month.

Speaker 3:          02:38:17       A new animal that big camp. And I was like, I don't know off. And he's like, what's a Dane? 18? That's how I was like eight, eight, seven, nine, six, 16. You guys, you have an interesting way of saying words. Yeah, it's proper English. That's what I think it is. It's Australian English. Yeah. It's weird because you free if you didn't know Australians. You guys sound like you're kind of English. Really? Yeah. Well there's like South African. That's very cool. Well, we're close, right? They only have a few words they say different than us. Like a boat. I, yeah, a minute. We're going to do a to around about Las Vegas, but they're polite. So they're the most polite people ever. Canadians, Australians. They're, they're pretty polite too. But Canadians are like for North America, they're the fucking kings, the king. Kings of politeness. But um, so back to this crazy that you did with Kim, if you couldn't eat the buffalo, how the fuck did you guys, I mean you kind of just chew it up and you'd fall into softer, softer spots.

Speaker 3:          02:39:25       And you guys lived off for that. Yeah, that Monday for the whole trip. And it's a bear Monday. Yeah. Real good fish. Like probably the best fish in the world. Oh really? Yeah. How do you catch that? Louis? We took little fishing rods in and we took a couple of Lewis. Is it a fresh water or salt water fish? They both. Yep. Where'd you guys catch them? Uh, we'll, we'll, we'll can't throw it on the coast. And um, it, it was horrible in a sense. It was good, but it was horrible. It was nice because you'd get a window each night but it was horrible because you'll need a lot of water in a river mouth. And the mosquitoes were like, as soon as it started getting dark mosquitoes would be impolite. But coalitions like your arms would go, black comedy mosquitoes if you didn't put something on. Like I said, we had to get a lot so I only had one tiny little tube of like an insect repellent. That's Ms Dot k dot that brutal

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       that you'd put that, you know. And they'd stay off for like two minutes. Cam didn't even have a net. So I would sleep. I had a hammock and I'd sleep in a hammock and I had a net of me, but my back would just get smashed by mosquitoes come back. She is lying against the net. No mattress or anything. I'd wake up in the morning just agonizing, wanting to scratch and and cam was assignment. I know net at all. They'll just Ashley's face all night. Yeah. How do you, you've highs not swell, shut and Hud and so can you cover stuff up with or anything you could if you went to that effort? I would have done it. Yeah, you would have done a fucking pussy. Mosquitoes now it's just like that just dealt with it. Yeah. You know, it's not even part of the thought process in a sense when you're on a hunt like that because it's just, you just want to be a part of the hunt, you know, and that's a part of the hunt.

Speaker 2:          02:41:04       It's a miserable part of the hunt, but that's just the part of the. I don't even like a fly buzzing around my head when I'm practicing my backyard. Really? Flaws twice will be trading in the corner of my eye and I'll just hold a conversation and people will be like, oh, I can't talk to you anymore. I'm like, what? What's up? You know? And there's, he's like, there's a fucking fly fucking in the corner of your mouth. Like, can you show it? And I'm so used to it. Yeah. How many days did you guys do that, hon? I'm must've been eight. I think it was eight in the end. Now when you decided to climb into that water to cool off, he didn't consider the possibility that there was in there? Yeah, the water was muddy and it's hard to tell if it's muddy because there's a big salt water crocodile stirring it up or because a buffalo gun wallow in every bit of water there is.

Speaker 2:          02:41:55       So um, we walk the edge and you look for crocodiles slides. Crock slides doesn't mean there's no crocs there if there's no crock slides. But we walk the edge and there was no crocs slides now. And Alan's a local. He's a teacher up in the indigenous community there. He knows the ward is pretty well, you can't, it's hard to tell if a crux moved in there over the season or, or anything like that. But we walk the edge and you just sat desperate to get wet. Like Cam was even to the point where he's like, can we just die? I'd, I'd actually prefer to cool off and then die. Let's just do it. And then the other side like you're desperate get sat heart that you're just desperate. And in a sense, since I think it was essential to get in the water at that point to get rehydrated, you know, just for skin intake and um, the water was the same temperature as outside.

Speaker 2:          02:42:45       Like you'd go into the water and you couldn't feel that you'll go and into liquid because the water's at hot as well. It's just been boiling in the sun. But the light in there and just chill out in the mud and every now and then you'd, it's all muddy. Bought them every now and then you'd sort of pushed them out and release some cooler waters that sort of hadn't been coupla aside and be like, oh ha ha, that's what I made you. You really have to go through that shit to appreciate things in life and one of those things that are just appreciate it. And

Speaker 3:          02:43:11       life was pushing for the modern, getting a little bit cooler water, you know, I was like, Oh, this is paradise. And then two seconds later you're like, oh, this is uncomfortable as shit, you know? Well, the fact that people live that way and struggled through those kinds of environments and those kinds of temperatures for untold years. Yep. Before they ever figured out ice a frigerator Eskimo air conditioning, not eskimos. That'd be like hate baby hate. Yeah. That's another extreme. Have you ever seen when people go up there and go hunting and like new Nevada go a hunting for a fucking big hairy things? What's the big hairy things? Ox Muskox, muskox things. It looks like a star wars animal. Yeah, it does. Yeah. It doesn't even look real time. Enroll in and get warm. Yeah. I mean, I've seen those things and you just go with that.

Speaker 3:          02:44:00       Okay, so people live up there and they have those things and then they live down where you are and they hope for cool mud. Those buffalo that we hunt, it'll be like, you'll think, ah, that's not going to be anything out any way that I. it's stinking hot. Everything will be in the shade under a tree or tucked under a riverbank or something like that. Those buffalo as black as I will be standing out in the open, complete son, just graze and nothing even bothering her, bombarding them. Now, most people listening to this have no idea what a scrub bull is. They hear the term spread bold. They don't know what it means, but it's a domestic domestic, a domestic cow that's bald. I have a many, many centuries in Australia. They've all Lena bread and it's a pretty crazy looking. That's the scrub bowl.

Speaker 3:          02:44:46       Cool. That thing, that's like a Brahmin there, so he's. He's a bit of a breed bull. Looking back on that thing, what a strange hump and all it is is that bold would be living in country where a lot of different artists, grable's haven't come through, so it's still a fully wild bull, but it is nice to grab a scrap that one right next to it, jamie with the crazy horns. Yeah. Yeah. He's a big boy. Whoa. That's scrub bill too. That's man. That's in America. Look at the trees in the back. Those are married. Is that it says Canada. Oh, Canada. What is that? Same thing right now. They can't even come over here unless we let them and they don't let us over here. Over there. If you've got a drunk driving conviction. So they have troubles in Canada. That's weird. I've never seen that before.

Speaker 3:          02:45:34       I thought that was an Australian thing. What does that one down there? These people would just fucking shooting their cows. Yeah, he'd be scrabbling. Wow. What a Brahmin. Okay, so that's a buffalo. That's not scalable. That's a big water buffalo at a crazy thing. That is. So that is something from Asia, Europe from Asia. Where is that? That's a water buffalo. Just just call the water buffalo. Yep. So there's a Cape Buffalo that are from Africa. What does that one? Not the lower left corner, but the one right next to a jamie? Yeah. What is that? What the. Is that a good scrub? Say, Oh look how the color is very in that because they real interbred animal, you know. And that's why bread with other, other variety of cattle. Hm. Now the mate value is not as good as the breeding values. Not as good because the visitors there, bit of this and they're a bit of that there a bit of everything.

Speaker 3:          02:46:28       It's like a dog, you know, you bought a purebred dog or you buy a mango, which is, you know, a couple of different species in one. What has the big value is the purebred right and assignment these cattle. So that. The big issue with the cattle industry, especially in these northern parts of Australia, is these. They scrubbed bulls. These feral cattle don't have any respect for fences. I would just walk straight through a fence into a farmer's prize cattle and stopped breeding with these prized cattle. And then all those carbs that he gets on the purebred cattle anymore, so it's really bad for the industry. So they knock the fence down, some composting. That's pretty much it. And a big issue. What would happen in America if those cows that I saw wandering around, if they were allowed to have balls and yeah, free day out there, they'd eventually become just like that, that that's right.

Speaker 3:          02:47:22       So they just didn't uncheck species of animal in Australia at the scrub and uh, they just free to come and go wherever they want. So. So a lot of farmers really pushed to shoot them out or get them cold or ran off or off their property. I'd say unbelievably aggressive. Super aggressive. More aggressive than a buffalo. Yep. Wow. Why underwater? Because they're pissed off because they were in a bread. Really? Yeah. They know they just a cranky animal. We've also got bulls are pretty fucking aggressive. I mean, obviously the bulls, I'm talking like bull cows that we have in America. That's why people ride them. They only get eight seconds if they're lucky. Yeah. They're trying to be like that. They're right. I don't know, just natural, I don't know, naturally pissed off. It's a good question because like when you see like bull fighters, are those bowls trained to try to fuck up the matador?

Speaker 3:          02:48:14       I mean, I don't know. Ask Rob. We'll just do that shit off their own back. I can tell you now that's really aggressive. We've got bank Tang Bulls as well. I've heard of those cats. Solly cattle. What's a bank? Tang? What does it look like? A Jeremy will bring on up. No Daddy. Say it. Bank Tang or spell? Excuse me? Um, they, I n j. t a n g a bank. I believe you've been wanting an ounce. One word. One would bang Tang. So back home that night eve lanes, they nearly extinct so that, that'd be, that'd be back home. Okay. So Asia in Indonesia, they're almost extinct, but America or rather Australia there where they run wild and they like a velvet skin cattle yet I run wild elephant skin. Skin man. They are a beautiful creature. What a weird looking kel. That's a good creature

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       type in. I'm good hand outback experience. That's one of my buddies that God's there for anyone interested and uh, he's got access to these bank Tang on some of the most beautiful country that you've ever seen. Like in northern Australia. Yeah. Bring up something from Carl's. They lucky they got a bank there. He's an old one. See that bolt's going across the head. It looks like their skin is suede. Yeah. And they will charge on movement real out of those all bulls. If they say movement vow that I would prefer to come at you then turn away because there's a risk in 10 in that back to you if you get within a certain distance and um, is called lay with a Yeti hat on. Hey, I'm, I shot one last year or the year before we've called and it comes straight at us and call us carrying a big gun lock.

Speaker 2:          02:50:00       I showed up with a bow and calo lifted up the gun and he shot this bank tank as it was charged and it literally dropped nine feet from Carl. Like it just looked straight at him and just hammered straight out of him. I'll go to a second shot off as it was running, actually broke its leg, which made it stumble and then it just comes straight back up and kept coming into colony, pulled the gun up and he showed it straight between the eyes. It was an amazing shot. Yeah, don't go by the way that man that I will tell you up. They're scary. Credo. What a weird as well. I guess it's because you fucking shot over the bow and Arrow to be upset with you. Probably. I mean it's, it seems like a crazy idea to shoot one of those things by yourself though.

Speaker 2:          02:50:40       Like you almost have to have a rifle backup. Yeah. But if that's the case, why hunt with a bow? Exactly. You have a rifle backup. She's probably time that I did with buffalo was with a gun the very first time I went was a good move. No, I had the bug. My buddy had the gum. Oh yeah. My buddy iron grant. He's a really good shot too, so I was like, hey, you want to come on this trip with me would be good. You can shoot one, but in that case, like why not just hunt with a rifle because you're not going to kill it with a bow. That quick might. You can. You can 95 percent of the time you can have five percent of motherfucker. So I shot three bulls on that trip. I got three complete postures with and I've got three bulls that died.

Speaker 2:          02:51:19       Right? In view. I didn't have a single issue, you know, but what the rifle Donnie's is that got you to go to places that usually wouldn't like that bulls out in the open. And if you didn't have a rifle backup behind you, you probably wouldn't proceed out there and be like, there's no trees around the client. I'm going to shoot that bowl. But when you've got a rifle, it makes you a little bit game of like, you know, obviously my buddy Aaron's on, you know, he's just waiting for shit to go south and he's gonna pull a gun off and give it one that didn't happen. Oh Man. I have a trip since I've never hunted with a rifle backup. But you've got to know your, you've got to know your boundaries. You know I, there's a big line bull out there. There's no trees.

Speaker 2:          02:51:57       He's right out in the open. You take a shot at him. He was the first thing he looks. He looks at, he's going to clean you up and I do it. You know that. That's, that thing happens. So fuck that. That seems ridiculous that you'll come in and do it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not allowed to. When they're laughing, that doesn't. What? What's the, the least likely to kill you if you shoot it in Buffalo, buffalo hunting. Really? No, no, hell no. The least likely to kill you. A freaking rabbit. Rabbit. You're good. Yeah. Right. Kinda out there. Was It on a rabbit? Oh, awesome. Well, you have to kill a lot of them. Don't show you. They're overpopulated, already popping. You got a skewer. Uhm, you know, get as many as you want. It's a funny thing. As big as that animal is, you know, and, and may say, know your boundaries.

Speaker 2:          02:52:43       If you do the right shot on that animal, that's the first thing. You know, you've got to make sure that shots right angles, right? You know, you're confident with your bow. You put that shot into the, to the right spot. Then there's no risk because that, that, that animal is dead before it gets to you staying still off the shop. You know, like I said, I'm not the person to shoot something like. Yes, yes, I shot it. I'm not like that. I think it's a little bit disrespectful even, but it's also, it's also a dangerous and it's on peaceful for the animal because you do that. It gives the animal and an adrenaline boost animals within an adrenaline boost. Man, that's, that's a hill reckoning, you know, buffalo or Buffalo, you know, that will carry them. It might make, um, it might make their death longer because, you know, they're filled with adrenaline and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:53:30       You shoot an animal and you be quiet. You put the shot in the right spot. It's so peaceful. I've actually shot things and they'd been like, what was that? Put their head down and stop fading again and toppled over why they fade and I don't even know their hit. That's one of the beauties about Boeing at tasteful and that's why you don't carry on like a frigging jerk. Why don't you shoot something, you know, just quiet, nice and humble. The animal dies peacefully. That's what every Honda should drive for. Yeah. It's um, also you'd have to have the proper equipment, right? If you're going to penetrate the side of a buffalo, you have to very strong bow and heavy arrows. Yeah. Um, I like that because you can't tell if you're going to hit a rebound. The yes and all the way out. And we've, my setup like I mostly shoot 70 pounds when I'm shooting idea at the moment and that heavy Arrow and a solid one piece.

Speaker 2:          02:54:19       It's just a solid piece of steel to blade. Broaden those vpa. Broader Shane Dorian shoot some as well. Blog vantage point, audrey. It's 150 grains. That's a heavy Bronto. Yeah. Then it's got a decent insert behind it, like 92 grain insert and then I'm a nice heavy shaft. And then let's just talk about the ID, Pam. We've got 80 pounds. I can find a rib on the way on the buffalo and I can find a Freebie on the way out. And the arrows still just going to bus straight through there. Now how have you used the Arrow? It's about. Well it depends what I'm shooting, but with the IED pan I'm shooting sit 670 grinds. Wow. Yeah. And with the 70 pound boat it's not much different. It's about 620 grinds, 670 grains is really haven't. But that Mike's a quiet bio and it makes

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       a punch when it hits animals. And how many feet per second? Again, none of that don't. I don't even get into that technical shit. Do you, uh, do tapes or do you do it by, uh, by eye and then write it on the tape? Not. I've got site tapes. So how do you calculate your site tapes? Um, if you don't. Well I've got the tiger or option archery now and it's a, the option five option six site. It's got an adjustable pin. Oh, you've got all your fixed pins that you flip in place now if that one I'll just shoot my 20 and actually shoot all my pins in the 50 and then I match it up with the site type and then I stick that on the go at the 20 minute mark. So then when I pull up multiple pin out of the way, I've just got the single pin that winds up and down that day mark.

Speaker 3:          02:55:49       Obviously I shoot it and check it, which I have and it's spot on. It's perfect. Okay. So you don't do anything like archers advantage, do it through a computer calculation. It's interesting. I just love shooting it all myself. It's so helpful. We'll move each pin for that shot. So I'll shoot and um, you know, zero to 20 the first pin and then I'll walk back the 30 and I'll shoot and I'll just to keep, keep shooting and adjusting that, you know, in tiny little increments if I have to. Do you have like a range at your house that you do all this stuff? I'd do it all up in the farm. You know, I sent you those photos at the time of that cabin that I built. That's amazing. Cabins. So incredible. I just got a crazy. I can shoot as far as I like.

Speaker 3:          02:56:26       Well, we're. We're almost done here, but let me, let me tell you people about your photography too, because you take some incredible photography when you're out and where you have this, like a book that you made of your photography that I got a chance to look at. Yeah, it did. I have to bring that along. Did I? That's cool. Somewhere and brought it back. Brought it to bear camp, but also you sent me to your website too and I got a chance to look at some of the photos that you have up. Yep. You take some amazing pictures. I love it. That's the other thing that I'll carry with me. Pack and paypal. People Freak because it's the canon five d mark three. It's an external Flash Bay batteries at why's the Tundra there? How much does it weigh? Not a ton, but 20 pounds. It have to be.

Speaker 3:          02:57:05       Is that your camera? Can I hold it then at a flash, like a big full size external flash to that and batteries. That's a lot in the pack. It's just like it's probably 10 pounds. Right. The end result of that is that's how you get those, those crazy photos. Wow. Do you carry a tripod as well? Yeah, I carry a little tripod. Yeah. Wow. Same tripod. Wow. Photography. You know, people can actually go to first man image, which is a [inaudible] instagram account that I've got. God that pictures incredible and there's a heap of pitches like that on this picture is from how long ago? That's all Idaho. That's just the other day yesterday, one day ago now. How do you take this photo, like where you see all those stars? Is it just setting the aperture correctly yet sitting aperture correctly? The Lens that I use, it's a, it's a stigma outlands.

Speaker 3:          02:57:56       It's the 20 Mil lens and the f stop on that Lens is only like one point four. Like that's super, Super Low, right? What does that mean? I don't know shit about photography, like your. I've been closed up and then United States, I say an f four, right. Your eyes really closed up and, and uh, f one point four would be like that. But imagine how much more light and everything he could get in. That's probably bicycle I have explained in it. And then, um, I will, I'll, I'll set the camera up. It's got to be on a tripod because that's like a, a. Jamie's got to explain. Hey, I've got an f number. Wikipedia. It's like exponentially larger. Every time you drop in a, an increment, it gets exponentially larger. And then as you go higher and f stops, it'll get smaller. Okay. There you go.

Speaker 3:          02:58:46       So self taught, this is all luck. I just self taught so I'm not really into the lingo, but they go, I'll go. So the same thing is with bowhunting. You're self taught with photographers as well. That's what happens when you live out in the jungle. Fucking bank tanks. Exactly. Wild snakes and decided that that's obviously set up on a tripod and it's about a 15 second exposure. So you know that it's open for 15 seconds and the guy was in a lot more like, damn, that Montana law is beautiful. How many days ago was that from Jamie? Six days ago. That's not as your. This is what a amazing fisher. And it's your tent and your tent looks like. Did you have like a headlamp inside the tent or something? That tiny little headlamp. So you left that on, left that on, and then set the camera up and the stars man.

Speaker 3:          02:59:37       So that's what you're seeing every night while you were camping up there every night until the moon. Come in, man. That's fucking pretty. I love moonless nights. Just just for that to the best. Yeah. It's nothing like that, that view of the milky ways and saying, hey, if he can join me, if you go back a little bit and you'll see you'll see some dead buffalo pitchers. And uh, I ran that time. I was taking some shots when I was in Arnhem land. And because there's no artificial, there's no, no light pollution. Anyway, up to the stars with the knife at all. I like the, the, the aperture and everything can come back so much further on those nights because it's just, even with the human eye, it's just crazy. Wow. Yeah. It's just lit up like you could actually walk around in the dark, just lit off the Milky Way. No Moon. You could walk around in the dark up there just because there's so many more stars that you can see. It's crazy and you always come up to it. There's the benefit of bonding people or the outdoors. Don't even get into Boeing. Just go camping in that door's Nah, you might have to go off a little bit. That's pretty cool though. That was the camp that I had go up or down. I'm older. Older.

Speaker 3:          03:00:49       That's a pretty good one. Yeah. Oh, oh my God. It's like you're in a spaceship. Yeah. I mean there really is like a spaceship. Yeah. So yeah, if anyone's, if any listeners are into the outdoors and not necessarily kill him because obviously Adam Green tree, Boeing's got a lot of um, harvest kilz on it. Um, if you just end up photography, just go to first man image. And the image shows me an image, Adam. Oh, I had him again. How many people didn't get that but in me. And I'm like, I just told one of the latest. Didn't get it. First man. Image on what? On instagram. Instagram. Yeah. Dispel it in some sort of weird Australian way. First.man dot image. Is that what it is? I think so. So it's Adam.green, tree dot bowhunter. If you're interested in looking at dead animals and stars and if you just want photography first, man, first.man dot image.

Speaker 3:          03:01:45       And you're a pussy if you dare you first.man.ms dot. Oh yeah man. God Damn. He takes some pretty pictures. Dude. That's amazing that you're self taught. I've been thinking about it lately that I need to get into photography at least somewhat to just take pictures with your iphone. I just. That's the best when you do so much. It's the best way to capture a memory because I can look back on the photos now and go, that's right. How cool is that? Or whatever. Sometimes I do so much and I get carried away with doing so much hunting that it's lucky if I didn't take a photo, I'd actually forget that moment because there's so much happening. So. And I just love showing it to my kids and friends and people that are interested in it. It's a really good promotion for the sport. You know, I used to think, um, do you call hunting and sport a dying?

Speaker 3:          03:02:30       I hate that word, but you just used it. I know, yeah. It's a common word that correct me. Yeah. I just, uh, I feel like there's a word for it, like natural life, like dismantle part of me or discipline. I think discipline is a better word for. I hear the sport, like, you know, welcome to the sport. Glad you're getting involved in the sport. And I'm like, oh. So like, or we could call it a pause. Time of cold pastime doesn't seem significant enough. It doesn't. Yeah. It seems like it's not. I mean, you shoot an elk, is that a pastime? No, it's way more than that. It's like, yeah, a life experience. Who I am, what we are, and then some. Right? Yeah. So you know, if you're getting into the sport, I'm not going to say it. If you're getting into bow hunting, I guarantee you wish you found that 20 years ago.

Speaker 3:          03:03:22       Bowhunting. Yeah, I wouldn't. You know what, I'm happy I found it when I found of course so busy. Always the height, the ID or if someone's going to go through life and never find this connection and that's the big push for me to promote bowhunting. I've written for the Australian outdoor magazines for like 12 years now and, and a lot of people think it's like a self promotion. Like I don't care. I don't care if I didn't have any views at all. As long as people were getting a that exposure, I was putting that out there for people to go, oh, I should try this. It looks cool. This dude's really enjoying it.

Speaker 2:          03:03:58       Here's the benefits in it and going and doing it because it drives me nuts. Just thinking that someone should have that connection. They just don't know it yet because a lot of the guys, especially the older guys that I've introduced to bowhunting have always been like, man, I would've never known about this before, and they've just got now I can't imagine them as anything else, but hunters because they just thrive on it that much and has done so much for their lives or just the outdoors. Some guys that are gonna get into it, try and been like, it's not for me, but I really love camp and being out there in the wilderness and even archery. Yeah, definitely shooting a target for me is like a form of therapy. So Zen moment.

Speaker 1:          03:04:35       Yeah. There's so much concentration going on that it cleanses your mind and if I can shoot bows for an hour every day, man, it just, uh, it, it alleviates stress and some sort of a strange like, you know, for lack of a better word. Zen.

Speaker 2:          03:04:49       Yeah. Yeah. Well it might be the best word for it actually. You were talking about earlier, like going out to the wilderness, no technology or anything like that. What it does, the demand is, it frees the mind, but like it's like it resets me. It's like hitting the reset button. That's all good. It's all fresh now. You know, it's just gives you time to think, you know. Yeah. And even

Speaker 1:          03:05:08       people that aren't into hunting, I totally understand that. And like I said, um, I've been really paying attention a lot to people that do these longterm hikes and also overlanding people that just go on these crazy adventures, like they get off the beaten path and they develop these vehicles that are capable of driving over adverse conditions and they just figured out a way to live out there in the desert or out in there. The mountains. It's fascinating to me because there's a longing I think that people have to get away from the concrete to get away from the electricity and to just feel the stillness of the actual world uninhibited, unencumbered, and an an uncompressed by, by civilization and buildings and language. And when you're out there, man, I don't, I've never done what you've done, but when you're out there for 11 days, you don't even talk to anybody for 11 days

Speaker 2:          03:06:04       this side, this trip I did because I had internet service at the top or a reception and I kept doing this, uh, insta stories, you know. Yeah. Those were great. By the way. I, you'll watch, watch all that. I wish you saved them though. Story disappear. Absolutely sucks. You're not hoyt. Need to do. If you listen to next year, send a photographer out or, or a film did and we'll film the whole thing. But then some dude's going to be talking to you. I'm not playing. That's the rules. He can't talk. He's got to have your campsite. And she jump in if a bears is trying to eat healthy. But um, so that sucked. But, um, I've had trips where you don't talk to people for days and days on end and just the fact of a common back into civilization and opening your mouth feels weird.

Speaker 2:          03:06:51       It feels absolutely we'd even, when you're talking up there, you're talking about. No, that's right. Yeah, yeah, I mean you're talking to the phone, you're like, Hey, I'm up here. I just told myself every now and then you do you seriously every now and then you'd be like, Nah, you just. Then you think like, what did I say that out loud? Because you haven't interacted with anyone for so long. It would be something like, oh, you fell over you frigging dummy, which happened a few times. You definitely don't want to break a leg up there. You'd be screwed. You bring a satellite phone. Yeah, I had a satellite phone. Yup. So in case shit goes bad. Yeah, and it's got an SOS button built into it that I even say it to Kim, my wife, you know, like you don't see that side of things, but I do actually take precautions to take us sat phone. That's it. And a time as this. There's, there's management within within it, but you. But you just don't see it.

Speaker 1:          03:07:43       Listened to. There's a very small handful of people, even in the hunting world that are doing what you're doing, that are taking those kinds of crazy adventures and just diving into it. It's awesome, man. I was. I was really blown away by those instagram stories and following you every day. I follow you several times a day I would go in and check in on it, make sure everything's going on, blah, blah. So awesome. Yeah. Good. That's good to say. You log in you. Unless shit probably like things more. I just look at him. I enjoy them. I need to hit that little heart button. People love you when you hit that heartbeat. Yeah, for sure. Alright, I'll give you a little louder. Louder. You need to do one of them tripped. Yes you do. I'm telling you you'll friggen five on a dude. It's interesting.

Speaker 1:          03:08:24       I don't think I didn't do that. You would get love it. Ah, I don't mind. I would like to go and do like a deep backpack trip solo. I don't know about all that. I don't want anybody finding my sneakers and you know what I'm saying? Fuck still inside from marks all over it. Don't be so ironic or eaten by the wolves that I love so much. Yeah, that's, that's funny. Like that. Well, Hey Brian, thank you very much for doing this. Who's on the show? Appreciate it. It's always cool hanging out with you and I'm glad we got a chance to do this. Awesome. And uh, again, Adam.green, tree dot bowhunter on instagram as well. Where else can people get you first.man dot image on instagram or you can find both of those on facebook as well. And you have a website. No website, no website, no website, no Weirdos. Thank you know Weirdos. All right folks, thank you very much. See you soon. Bye.

Speaker 4:          03:09:16       That's great.
