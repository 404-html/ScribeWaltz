Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Do we have power? Yes. Yes, yes. The machine. Ladies and gentlemen on Showtime. Bert Kreischer, Douglas Douglas, me, boy. Doug's dad hope almost married him in the early two thousands if Marilyn Manson wants to come around, you can come out. Bill burrs here. Bill Burton, Ladies and gentlemen,

Speaker 2:          00:00:35       because I stutter. Bill Bird, just good

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       calming. Wait, where are you? Silly Diaz. This calming Judge Judy as he's come in. You told me I started doing. A lot of people are coming. We're watching Greg Fitzsimmons. Everybody says, Ladies and gentlemen, Gray's gonna start drinking tonight. Rogan is there. It's over

Speaker 3:          00:01:11       Kroger. Dot. This is all I have. All I have is a fake smile and an opener wrote something. No, I, this is a text I sent to you last week when I was at, I thought the worst day of my life until today. And I came to town to try to organize this and I don't know what the fuck, I can't live stream. What does it, you have a car. So this is what I sent to Rogan at the depths of what I thought was the worst hangover ever.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       We're all adults, folks. This is bullshit. Even even worrying about this is both with cotton candy here.

Speaker 3:          00:02:01       This is what I wrote to rogue in a week ago. I get a date right there and hit that bill. I wrote a lot of shit. A little cool. I'm in a serious panic mode and really want to bail on it. Meaning this,

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       I think it's a great idea, but I have no idea how to organize it and it's so close. The comedy store gave us the day and I don't want to fuck them over, but I don't know how to make this work. I fucked up and don't know how to put it together. I don't want to put all this on you, but I don't want to be the guy responsible for an abortion, but way far only you and a vague bill burr have committed. I want to fake a stroke to get out of ruining. It saved me. Ps has been a long week.

Speaker 2:          00:02:53       Rogan, Rogan, very succinctly

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       rights back.

Speaker 5:          00:03:02       We'll figure it. Oh fuck man. That's it. I'll handle it. Don't sweat it. It's nothing. We show up. We drank. I smoked pot pot. We talk easy.

Speaker 4:          00:03:13       [inaudible] fucking Rogan says it's good. It's good.

Speaker 5:          00:03:25       Made it road on the man show. Get two guys. Oh really? Do you still get hate mail from them? No. The writers, no one's no, but I can say there was a, there was very little preparation and a, and there was some funny fucking monologues that were on that show. We had some fun. Yeah, you don't need preparation then sometimes you do like right now.

Speaker 4:          00:03:46       Well, I had that. I had that

Speaker 6:          00:03:47       fill that out. That weird. I like the Doug always. I don't want to be the guy responsible for an abortion, but he's totally had abortions that he's paid for her for Christ. You're bringing it down. Plus when Donald Trump becomes president, you're a fucking criminal portion. Draws it at eight for a plethora of abortions.

Speaker 4:          00:04:12       By the way, if you thought this was going to be about the election, no, it's the end of the world. Either way. Yeah. If you guys, we wouldn't pay here. I do have to. I have to do this. Brent Ericson Ericson. We do have our breaking news guy, Brent Ericson. Fantastic comic is actually having to watch the CNN coverage. So anything actually does matter. He'll run out and be breaking. He has a laptop. Yeah, kind of lyrics and he's watching it. That's fine. We can just do four hours before the shows. I do you have any TV screens? Are there any laptops? What are we going to do out there? Very hasty. Hastily thrown together yet planned for months. You texted me about this easily in August, easily

Speaker 6:          00:05:15       a year ago. He came up with it. I realized, no, I think everyone doesn't like me. When you returned my texts, they were scared that girl. Aw, that's adorable. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, there's uh, an election. It doesn't matter if you care about does it Kinda does. What matters the most is that no matter who wins, we're both, we're all of us really alike. Okay. I mean, it's not good. No. If Trump wins when Obama won, didn't you feel like, wow, this is some new shit. A guy couldn't form full sentences, went to actual schools.

Speaker 4:          00:05:54       That's very racial, very articulate

Speaker 7:          00:05:58       as opposed to George Bush. You fuck. That's how I look. We were happy. We're having them look at this really articulate, intelligent guy that's reasonable. What he does on election day. It's your tradition not making this up. He plays basketball on election day. Good for him. I heard that on CNN today. That's why I talk shows actually have screeners and go, hey, what are you going to say? At what point?

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       [inaudible] you have an interesting story about, you could be like Byron Allen on that late night show going to the zoo. Completely different. Bill Furry like to water ski. Slowly a bit funny. You brought that up and here's my anecdote. That fits perfectly right before the commercial. Don't forget to segway to Kreischer with something completely

Speaker 7:          00:06:45       different. Friday night for Chrysler in the machine on showtime.

Speaker 4:          00:06:49       Then 11 respect to the machine. I get a cut of the Nachos, so get some Nachos. They're very good. They squeezed that by hand. That sauce.

Speaker 7:          00:07:02       I feel about Nachos at the comedy store the same way I feel about whoever the fuck wins. President.

Speaker 4:          00:07:09       Alright, got to do what you gotta do, man. Press real younger. If the president really affects your life,

Speaker 7:          00:07:17       you've made poor choices or you met him. What if you met that Guy Jon Stewart thing? 50 years old. But you see the Jon Stewart thing, your muscles don't know it. Jon Stewart, Jon Stewart, uh, did some veterans show and on the veterans show he read out this tweet exchange he had with Donald Trump. It's like in his ass now. It's fucking hilarious. And Donald Trump's tweets him at one 30 in the morning. Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and we'll be hopeless in a debate with me. And he's a liar because he changed his name. That would go, that's the best joke. Cause he goes, his real name's Jon Stewart or his real name is John [inaudible] and Burger whatever. Liebowitz Chin. And then Jon Stewart wrote back, John Jay, that's right. And Donald Trump's real name is fuck face bond sticker with by clowns. Stick mouth. Fuckface von clowns thinking he doesn't know why he won't embrace the von clowns. Pick camp heritage. And at the end of it, one 30 in the morning, Trump tweets him at one 30 in the morning. Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and we'd be hopeless in a debate with me. I wouldn't even

Speaker 4:          00:08:23       I, I'm, I'm going to, I'll be the dude. That means he was walking around talking to himself. Yes, they, they, they debriefed him for the next presidential thing and he goes, all right, I will see you later. And he closed the doors walking around in his gold toed socks and his fucking hotel room. Fucking noodle took off with saying I'm a fucking asshole. He had probably some woman. They're going, Donald Telco on the Internet is shit. I'm not taking this shit from him. Fucking liberal media. I fucking tweaking this thing out here. We probably like it all down below. What's worse is he was really to do that. Who is doing that? Is the system following him around? Tell no che dish. No, don't hit send. Yeah. Shay Desk. Who Buy your pussy? I'll fuck it on its head. Don't hit send. That's Mr. Trump. That's going to have the red phone. That's going to have the red phone dude him and five whatever Vladimir, whatever that fucking Russian dude's name is like vitamin. You wait till one time when his fucking off, he'll call him on the red phone.

Speaker 7:          00:09:36       Well, I think we're going to find out if that guy can really do anything. Like we never really knew if the president can actually do anything because they always seem to promise one thing and they get an officer to a totally different deal. Once they're inside, we're going to find out what this guy, if he really gets in there, he's going to start talking shit. Oh. Like from inside the White House talking shit about how the government works so they won't do his bidding. It's going to get really fucking weird. Oh, you're going to hear that to that, uh, that the song by Bachman Turner overdrive, you ain't seen nothing yet. She shows you how fragile this group of people really is. This weird group of people that we call America. We're about to elect a douchebag. Either wipe verifiable, but upside Joe is, we'll probably get to see an assassination.

Speaker 4:          00:10:27       Oh, hey, no, we, I can't believe he went there Friday all 1111. She is an update Cotsen Hannah again, the filthy uncut. Scott's Wisconsin's now, boom. What do we got? Oh, I've done that are breaking news guy, Brent Ericson. What do you have? Break this. Justin. Bert Kreischer special Friday night. Showtime rejoices wait too fucking high for this. November 11 and Gary Johnson is that 3.7% and when you were supposed to get Gary Johnson

Speaker 7:          00:11:16       on did come on the podcast, we lost him to CNN. Well the second time you and I were supposed to do a podcast together with Gary Johnson who was all in, but we lost him. A CNN. Gary Johnson. Why? Cause he follows me on Twitter.

Speaker 4:          00:11:31       That's reason enough. There you go. Yes. Come on ladies.

Speaker 7:          00:11:36       You tell me. Stop. Take your whip. My Dick. Stop voting with your vagina or vote Jill Stein. That map looks like somebody hit one of those avatar people with a truck.

Speaker 4:          00:11:51       I'm just killing me all the college ways. How to glue thing. Bladder of non readers. You can't turn that towards, you know, I want to Greg Fitzsimmons to see this. Greg, you recognize all those were all best shoe at territory's. Remember that we had this college agent, great guy, but he used a book us in the middle of fucking nowhere. He'd always call me Billy Scott Bass calling half a Gig for you in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. Now they don't have a lot of money, but I can build around it and then he won't be stage. It's at 12 noon in a hallway. Can you do it? Always take it. And then I'd call, I'm going to be yelling at him. I'm never fucking doing one of those gigs again. Blah Blah. And you would just fit on the road sign and this is going. Yeah, you're will. You're broke. You're on a futon. Guy Is an age

Speaker 8:          00:12:42       so sharp. He's a, he's in Chicago and I call him. He's great dude. I don't want to trash, you know, he's great, but here's how sharp he is. I called up and I go, uh, I go, Louie CK needs a college agent. And this is like, Louie had already had a special ed too, but he wasn't quite there. And he goes, he's too old. I call it to this day going, you fucking

Speaker 4:          00:13:04       and when you send them the map, he kept getting them gigs in like South Dakota and Wyoming. He was living in New York. He sent him a map of the United States and circled Manhattan. He goes, I lived here. They could never get us a Gig in New York. Barry Katz at an all fucking sewn up. Oh my God, Christ. And I got, I got a Gig in Grand Junction, Colorado. Dude, I remember he had half asleep driving like 90 in the wrong direction in Colorado trying to make this fucking gig and this dude and like a Bronco drove right at me with like a little blue light. Pulls me over. He gets out all he has on his, the cop shirt, he's got it like jeans and and no hat and he walks up and he punches the window. He goes out like yelling at me. I'm like, is this guy going to fucking shoot me? So fucking lunatic. And then I had to turn around to go up to where the fuck Greeley, where they really a good guy. They got a fucking a w when they slaughter pigs and shit, they actually had bad smell days, whether you call the slaughter house and be like, Hey, can you take it easy? A little slow it the smell, it dries my daughter cry.

Speaker 4:          00:14:16       Can you do it? I can build around it. Yeah, I got you at noon in Wisconsin that night. North Dakota. It's a nine hour drive, but if you leave right after the Gig, they give you the check beforehand. You can make it, sorry, this is just getting so inside the last, so just dropping, dropping, forcing me into a Gig. I was going to say, hang on there talking about these gigs. She's like, they're the old days. We just both played a fucking, see how she, two weeks ago she food restaurant in Fayetteville. Fucking Arkansas sign. There's a sign next to the restaurant and it says three dogs. I got once we, I did one in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They had a drive through liquor store that was connected to a strip club. So you're looking in and you're seeing the dances walking around. The guy says, sly look, and I get for you for the record. The drive throughs in was

Speaker 5:          00:15:17       you can get a mixed drink in Wyoming and a drive through, but they put a cover on the drink and put tape. So

Speaker 4:          00:15:26       wait, it's a sealed beverage

Speaker 7:          00:15:29       by the way. There's 30 minutes of me doing this

Speaker 4:          00:15:36       oyster shack in four weeks ago

Speaker 5:          00:15:42       with Joe and I. He started out in a club called Nick's comedy stop that may or may not have been mob run and the back of the club was prostitutes cause it was in the red light district. They'd come in out of the coal and cops shoulder to shoulder watching comedy. That was a crazy place. Yeah, I missed all the good days. It's by the time I got there it was like the whole boom was over. Yeah, I did a Shitty Gig once. It was a one and done Boston comics. We're never going to get a word in edgewise. Remember Lenny Clarke shout over your sport coat.

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          00:16:22       Lenny's brother, Mike Clarke booked me on a ton of gigs and one of them was in a restaurant and it was a seating area. It's like the area where people see it and waited for the name to be called this giant fish place down in the Cape and your sound system on stage was connected to the, the closer the wire system course it was so the PA system and they said they all use this same speaker but they would override you so you'd be in the middle of doing a joke. Then John 10 party and the table's ready. Johnson too afraid to go back in again a second time.

Speaker 5:          00:16:57       It was a one and done. I did a Gig at a red lobster

Speaker 4:          00:17:03       like a Sunday night and it was all these bibs on and shit and we're in the corner. We just on this little roped off corn, hey fucking fuck, fuck fucking into this mic. And he's just looking over like, what is that? Is that part of the restaurant? It was just like, no, you weren't angry waiter and you wanted to laugh at the person going on in front of you, but like you couldn't get past the fact of like, I have to do that in 10 minutes when he's done, that's going to be me. So you can never totally fucking enjoy it. But anyways, Trump has 2002

Speaker 5:          00:17:38       0.3 and Clinton has 1.8 in Ohio. Oh my God. Holy Shit. He's going to win Ohio. I was just in Dayton last week. That doesn't help plug help. That's

Speaker 6:          00:17:50       a good barometer. This is honestly when I made it in comedy was when I could turn down Dayton, Ohio, Lisa Grigsby. That's number one. That was my thing. When I sit down, fuck you guys. Okay, I don't wait. And they papered the room. Everybody should [inaudible] status and the paper, the room, those are like the worst words you ever want to miss. Misread my contract. And I got in the car after Bob and Tom and I go, how's the week look? And they go, fucking fantastic. Were oversold on every show. And I went, when did I blow up? And then we got there and they were like, yeah, the paper, the whole room and no one paid for tickets. And I was like, motherfucker, I get 75% of nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       Are there comedians, comedians in the house? If you're here, that the front room of jokers in Dayton, Dayton, home of the ultimate Bachelorette party, which is the death knell of comedy, but they sell and they would sell dildo hats. Oh Shit. Oh, horse fucking club draws the second you saw him with the Little Dick Straws. You just like this fucking show. It's going to be brutal. I got to hang in there for 45 fucking minutes. You know some people need a sitcom. I just needed a never have to work date men had rubber vagina hat. Imagine the brutal outrage dudes running around licking fake pussy.

Speaker 9:          00:19:19       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       probably look a lot like Donald Trump. I need a cigarette anyway. Hey, this is how this goes. We have no fucking idea how this goes, but we're going to rotate a bunch of people. You don't have to discuss this. I think they get it, but I'm bringing someone in and watching a shit show on to Jim. Jefferies brought his stupid baby buddies.

Speaker 1:          00:19:45       I didn't smoke on stage. You don't bring babies, Jeff. Jeff Rose.

Speaker 9:          00:19:54       You know what?

Speaker 3:          00:19:56       He's not here. I need to bring my cost in. He probably wants to say shit, but I gotta have him on stage. Chad Shag.

Speaker 9:          00:20:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       Garber for me. I'll tell him, by the way, I will keep, you want to browse? Oh, the kids

Speaker 3:          00:20:17       stays in the picture.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       I don't think this is the right kind of air for this child to be British.

Speaker 9:          00:20:30       Hey Jim. Jim Jeffery's

Little kids don't watch politics. There you go. It's all about the future. Oh, I'm not comfortable with this. You're not comfortable with what we're doing. Trump's Trump's winning New Hampshire. Hillary's winning Virginia. Really? And there's a little kid here

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       decided it was good idea.

Speaker 10:         00:21:23       Somebody please take a photo of this last supper here. Here's my phone. I think this is the lead. I don't want that on. Why is it illegal? What's illegal about this? Having a baby on stage while people are drinking booze and smoking pot. We're fucking, what am I crazy? I would've been good to stay off Mike.

Speaker 11:         00:21:42       Oh, they've got, there's some legality problems.

Speaker 12:         00:21:44       Ah, yeah.

Best Picture of Hillary Clinton and best picture of the other guy I've seen throughout this entire thing. Donald actually has a nice smile. Hillary looks nice. You know, cause he always made them look like fucking lunatics.

Speaker 10:         00:23:25       Did you guys see the picture of Donald watching his wife vote? A lot of trust in that relationship. That's the same look I give my dog when he gets too close to my cat.

Speaker 12:         00:23:43       Okay,

Speaker 10:         00:23:43       well what are you doing mother fucker? Leave her alone.

Speaker 5:          00:24:36       Can we all agree this doesn't fucking work. I mean, you can't have one guy

Speaker 11:         00:24:43       wholesale, right? Hey d,

Speaker 5:          00:24:52       you can't have one woman. You can't have one. Anybody run the whole thing? It's fucking crazy. It's some crazy alpha chimp position. We should have got rid of this fucking stupid job a long time ago. It's not how you should ever run anything. You should never have one fucking person. Ladies and gentlemen, the most important. Burn me. You fucked. I run this bitch. That's a crazy position. Nobody should have that position and most importantly, nobody should want that fucking position.

Speaker 11:         00:25:23       Yeah, but doesn't the Senate representatives and it's at the balance there. They keep checks and balances. Vaguely remember that for my history class and like fifth grade and then they send it to the thing. I'm just a bill. Yes. I'm only a bill and it goes to the thing. Right, and they fucking go around. Congratulations Bill. Now you're a law. That's what keeps them in check.

Speaker 12:         00:25:46       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:25:50       I think the school schoolhouse rock, I think we should vote on the Internet. I think we should vote on everything on the Internet. I think everybody should collectively decide what the fuck we should be doing. The guy that was driving me an Uber tonight, I go, you fall the election and he goes, yeah, a little bit. I said, I said, really? He goes, yeah, when did, when did those start

Speaker 11:         00:26:13       today? And he goes, how long has it lasts till I go to today? What is it? Here's my question. Ready lasts for like five fucking days. It's so complicated. He said a little bit, literally meant a little bit. I want to be that guy, dude, that's a fucking great guy to beat. You know it is. If you're all right with it. Just like once the election. Well, I thought how long does it last? Really? I thought he was driving is don't give a shit.

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       Literally it was like a how so how do you get set up in to do and being able to vote and I want it when you get a little driver's license and Mike, you're driving fucking Luber, you definitely have a driver's license. And then he goes, who's, I probably did that. And I go, yeah, but he had dark hair and big eyebrows. So I said the valley. So I go, so where are you? Where did you, where were you born? And he goes, if fucking van Nuys. And I was like, are you really don't know anything about this. He's like, not anything like,

Speaker 11:         00:27:17       why do we do it this way? I gotta tell you something, dude, if Trump wins, this is the him just winning the, the nominee blows away. Anything I've ever seen in sports. The US beating the Russians. It's just all pales in comparison. This is a reality TV show star

Speaker 4:          00:27:35       who got mad at a breakfast because Obama trash to him and he's like, well fuck it dude. He's going to do it like it or not. That is some, you can't talk shit in the room with that guy. Yo. One time this guy stepped me in the bar to fuck you. What time the president was giving me shit and I said, Oh yeah, I'll have you a fucking job. And two years and I did it and I did it. Fucking real man. Don't like his policies. But you gotta respect the Jesus.

Speaker 6:          00:28:14       Hey Bill. If you want someone to go on stage with you and just sit on a stool and laugh, I'll do it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:28:21       So is this

Speaker 11:         00:28:22       the fate of our nation that those little gray areas, those bitches that like this is always what happens? Does the red guys do well in the middle? The blue people do all right in the beginning, right? But the east coast and all of a sudden they get into the SCC, right.

Speaker 4:          00:28:36       Going to be swapping some pain. Then the red guys start coming back. Then, uh, then, then, then you get, hey man, you start getting near the fucking ocean man. And like I live near her notion, therefore I'm smarter man. That comes around and then it gets a little more blue. So this saying over all by a long shot, ladies and gentlemen, we shall see. It's just so, let's say they shitting on CNN right now. If you're watching at home, you want to put on CNN, you got to watch the channel where they're losing. That's the funny shit. Happiness is not enjoyable. You want to see nervousness. Beads of sweat. Blue ties me in high.

Speaker 6:          00:29:19       Wouldn't you like to take a peek at all the comics from the UCBS Twitter right now?

Oh, fuck me. No, I'm kidding you about him being CNNS bitch. I voted for him, but uh, I couldn't get them know Arizona's pink. Who's busy sort of a bandaid color. I don't know what that means. Is that the whole fucking election? That's Photoshop my space. That's what bill [inaudible]. It's all lit. It's lightened up. It was like, what did she look like this back in the 90s that's like one of those mall portrait photographers in front of a shitty fake. That's a fucking great photo. So does anybody, what is the numbers here? One 67 for Donald Trump won 2140 to 70 she's 103 away. Hope but he's kicking her ass. I know, but it's great. It's Obama was, did he ever call you? Did he ever check in on you to make sure you okay. At the end of the day, it's on you. Who's packing your lunch tomorrow? People. You are who's putting food on the table? You are all right. You don't need these fucking people.

Speaker 12:         00:30:59       Yeah, it's fine.

Speaker 5:          00:31:04       Having said that, this is amazing. Look at Michigan.

Think he's going to win. Yeah. It's entirely possible. Or Fuck I told you. Why don't we get to San Francisco and all of them, man. We'll see what happens. They saved the Toric Lens for the end so they didn't build it up and slide it out right in the beginning. Are you saying there's a Goddamn conspiracy son?

Speaker 5:          00:31:44       The conspiracy is that we still do it this way. Why don't we just have everybody have an opinion? Well, you know we don't have a coach and buggies across the country. Joe. How many down the road? Too long to believe that everyone should happen at Amazon. One Click, how come I can't vote like that? I can buy toilet paper. They deliver it to your house in a day with one click. I could bank your bank. You could just, you can do whatever you want. You can pick up on line. I don't give a shit. Yeah, I did it online. It's crazy money online, but you can't handle votes. That's ridiculous. I bought a car part of it. They took out a thing. They wanted to take my thumbprint when I my fingerprints, you freak out and I was like, yeah, I'm not doing that. I go, why would I do that? And they go, well, she's just took your notes to protect you in case somebody comes in and a person they choose to buy a car. It's just like, yeah, I want to take my on that

Speaker 11:         00:32:42       fucking moron. I'm going to get my fingerprint to a car dealership. You guys are the biggest liars in the world, so you can just pick it on some date. Rape victims forehead.

Speaker 11:         00:33:12       Are you one of those guys? It's free to use a thumb sensor on your cell phone. Do you have like an older cell phone? I'm not afraid. I'm just, I just don't do it. No. Two or three skin man. What's the phone to do? No, I don't use your cloud. I dropped my phone in a fucking toilet and I lost everything. I lost all my videos, all my numbers, everything. Cause I don't use the fucking cloud whenever they say, is it okay if we, you know, see you location? No, it isn't. When I go to those things and they go, hey, you want a little savy saved card? I say, no, I don't fuck off. And whenever they ask me questions, if I'm in the mood to answer, I give them misinformation. I go all over the place. All over the place. You should relationship. I like deer hunting. I just got back from Antarctica. Anything just to throw them off the scent. What's your mother's maiden name? Whoa. Barney Miller. Big Fan. So why would you help him?

Speaker 12:         00:34:21       Okay,

Speaker 6:          00:34:22       that's a good point. It's undeniable recoveries.

Speaker 11:         00:34:30       No, I got to quit. I have a great Facebook page. It's so great. I almost stood up to tell it to you. They fucking, I go to change my password because I'm so sick of my, you know Kevin, 58 of them. Right. And I'm like, when I just pick three, it just stick with that. So I go, all right, I'm going to change it. Then all of a sudden they send me an email. They go, yeah, we lock this shit just in case it is in you. But if you want it, you got to send us a picture of you and like your fucking task court. And it's just like, yeah, go fuck yourself. I'm not doing that. So for like a week I couldn't do it. And then after like 10 days, it was cool to be back on it again cause it kind of like, oh he's not coming back. We, we need them, we need them. So we clicked on revenue and top 10 were celebrity boob jobs. So we make our money. How come they needed a 10 days ago, Joe? And all of a sudden they don't need it now. And I'm on Facebook again. Why is that

Speaker 6:          00:35:20       point as well? You're making some great points.

Speaker 11:         00:35:22       I am. I'm making tremendous points and I hear the sarcasm in your voice. No, no. He goes down. Oh, me smokes a little fucking weed and all of a sudden I'm, I'm the Moron in the rock.

Speaker 9:          00:35:40       Oh,

Speaker 5:          00:35:40       I haven't said that. I still need that shoulder workout. You don't telling me about him? I worry about the fingerprint thing. It's weird. It's weird. You put Gary Johnson, just one Puerto Rico.

Speaker 9:          00:35:55       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:35:58       Powerful. Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is like one strange child that you had with your mistress, so you don't really like to talk about, but you give them money. They're not really, it's more like a beautiful child that we have hidden the attic. Well that's, that's probably a better description you're writing, but they're not really a state, right. They both, they're a part of the United States. People that were enjoying their lives and then we showed up I think is what happened, but there and shit. I don't think they want to be a state. No idea. Good. Good. Yeah. Look at Pico, but it's one of those weird ones like Guam where you're like, what's going on? Aware where, who owns this? Since you guys or is it us? Who is this

Speaker 13:         00:36:39       breaking news?

Speaker 5:          00:36:41       Doug was Stan hope with breaking news. You know, I know John King's pretty good at this on CNN, but he doesn't fucking bar back at the same time. I just want to say that he probably doesn't get tipped out either, but on bar back in this fucker, uh, Virginia 13 electoral votes go to Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 9:          00:37:06       That means

Speaker 5:          00:37:08       let's start one 67 for Trump won 22 for Clinton. Ooh. Oh, sandals. States are common, everybody. The bargain sites. It's a common, this is going to be close.

Speaker 13:         00:37:23       Hey, Rogen, do you want to be, I know it's a bit early, but, hey, how you doing? How are you man? Should we just bust his balls now before he takes off? Who smells

Speaker 5:          00:37:36       really? Oh, oh. Can I kill you? Introduce him.

Speaker 13:         00:37:40       They all just run ad nauseum and I fucking love him and he's the only person on this day that I could call and go. He's still more second pathic than I am. Chad chank was napping, but Marilyn Manson, Jay, you're fucking stinky ass.

Speaker 9:          00:38:00       No, no, you don't have to leave. Matt will bring you a mic.

Speaker 5:          00:38:08       This show is going so much better than we had. High. Go quick. We don't need it. We were barely talking about the end of the world. He doesn't want to come up, but he's sitting right there and then come on out.

Speaker 9:          00:38:22       I'll print the entire crowd crowd. Yep.

Speaker 5:          00:38:33       No, I'm going to get another Jameson.

Speaker 9:          00:38:37       No,

Speaker 14:         00:38:38       clearly is a gentleman that might be the funniest men alive. He's up there is him and Diaz.

Speaker 6:          00:38:44       It's in the running of this. My, this has been the hardest. I've laughed in my life and I, I been, I know people don't like my last hope. I've been a microwave from my mouth because I cannot shut the fuck up. Love your lab. What are you talking about? It's like my favorite thing about you and this night couldn't be better. Where were you when you found out that Trump was running for president? I was doing cocaine with Marilyn Manson.

Speaker 9:          00:39:07       What a fucking night.

Speaker 14:         00:39:10       Hello? I'll let Ridley, we have another state that is declared Colorado nine electoral votes. Go to Hillary Clinton. Oh, it's getting hot. One 67 for Trump won 31 for Hillary Clinton. Wow. Look at this whole thing is so bizarre. Is anybody like rooting for anybody to come back and Christ you to keep laughing? That's all. And Joey Diaz, but he'll be here eventually. What do women want Hillary Clinton to win?

Speaker 13:         00:39:47       Okay.

Speaker 14:         00:39:47       Oh, some of you do. Some of you do. I'm going to watch those girls very carefully. Give a fuck camp.

Speaker 9:          00:39:57       Here's

Speaker 13:         00:39:57       weird. You opened up smoking a joint up here, but Jim Jeffries got bailed out as you can't have a kid

Speaker 14:         00:40:06       near. We have a list as a part of the show. Nobody knows it joint. Can you just fucking ratted me out? I never even talked about it earlier. The cigarettes get the fuck out. No, you're all right. You're allowed to smoke on stage and California.

Speaker 13:         00:40:19       No, but then the smokers see you smoking and then they want to go outside.

Speaker 6:          00:40:24       Oh Hey, real quick, real quick, what? I want to interject, what's going on with prop 64 is that the is

Speaker 14:         00:40:30       is that, I think it's kind of halfway sketchy. He's calling you. What'd you there? Hang that shit up. He's a grown man. He's right there. He's a grown man. Tell him to come out here. How dare they said? Come on out here please.

Speaker 9:          00:40:42       Calling you. Fuck with beautiful man guy.

Speaker 13:         00:40:52       My sanity today. Oh, now, now they're doing interventions on Madison.

Speaker 14:         00:41:02       Bert Kreischer Friday night showtime. Is it 11:00 PM

Speaker 6:          00:41:08       no, 10:00 PM 10:00 PM I keep saying 1111 oh my God.

Speaker 13:         00:41:12       Yo. I was in such a panic tonight for other reasons. I took an Adderall. I go, I think I took this too late. I'm going to walk down. I'm busting Manson's balls like, well, it's a block away. We can just walk like fucking men. I'm manning up. I'm putting on a fake comedy face to do this shit under extreme circumstances. You can walk down here and I know he's going to get on stage and you know it's going to be on stage. You think it's happening. I can go on and on and on, but it's going to be funny because I thought the dynamic of Manson and Rogan, you'd be so treacherous.

Speaker 11:         00:41:53       It was. It was. It was. It was alarmingly like, uh, like almost like a high school reunion. Joseph's while somebody goes, hey man, we met one time and it was like the coolest fucking thing in the world.

Speaker 13:         00:42:03       Oh thanks bill. Boom. You were there. Cheers by day. There's no proof that our pod cast what Manson at his house with Bingo.

Speaker 11:         00:42:16       No. You know what's funny? Both you and him said that and you were so fucked up. You don't remember. I wasn't there.

Speaker 9:          00:42:27       Yes.

Speaker 11:         00:42:28       He's, he's claimed for 20 minutes that we've met each other. I've never met him. Were remember I was right as I was going to say, huge fan. He goes, yeah, I remember that time we will fucking hanging out. I was, no, no, no. I don't remember. I would've remembered that

Speaker 13:         00:42:43       I'm, Nancy was looking it up in his phone, but I wasn't there after that. I came out when when they save party, like a rock star. He's the only rock star that really parties to like a rock star, so I'm trying to keep up.

Speaker 11:         00:43:00       Okay. Do Your podcast. That's right. I'm sorry.

Speaker 13:         00:43:04       Yeah, you're right. You're right. As fucked as I've ever been. I'm wearing that leisure shoot. Remember the leisure suits,

Speaker 11:         00:43:13       they all kind of blend together.

Speaker 13:         00:43:18       Jackets, shorts, matching. I Hennigan pulls me out of bed with like 30 minutes sleep bingos in a fucking crazy state. Air B and B. I tell Hennigan, put the top down. We're going to your place on the fucking sticks. You both, I can do the valley shit. I show up and I was judging in reeking of booze. We were talking about this earlier when when you feel the heat coming off of you and you just think that's your imagination and then you put your sunglasses on and they fog up. Oh fuck. And I'm already seriously intimidated by Bob Burg and I'm doing his podcast and I show up. I'm smelling bad. The sound went out. I didn't know what I was talking about.

Speaker 11:         00:44:11       It's far as I remember. It went great. I remember saying, I never realized what a bundle of nerves you are. What are you going to stand in the mirror and say, God damn, I love you Doug Stam home. You're a genius comedian and you're worthy of all your success

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       now. [inaudible]. The end of that story is after bill's burrs podcasts, he came to my house and he came and he and Andy Hill was hammered. I don't remember any of this and he came early cause he thought birth podcast to be three hours and it's an hour. And then he comes to my house and my dogs are sniffing at my door and I'm like, what the fuck? I opened the door, Doug's sitting in one of my Adirondacks shaking, smoking a cigarette and looks at me. He goes, I could use a cocktail.

Speaker 9:          00:45:07       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:45:07       we did a five hour podcast interrupted only to have dinner with my children. I was one of the best things

Speaker 13:         00:45:15       my life after I got done with Berg, I went to his house and I was a new drunk now and now it's the next night even though I haven't slept. It's kind of like a new day. I have, he's got the kids. He's got his own fun house.

Speaker 6:          00:45:32       Yeah. And the garage. Yeah. The man, my man cave that they, the TV show did that for you, right? Yeah. Yeah, man caves. That's why I called him. If I walked into a locker room, it was all black guys and they were like, look at that cock. I call my digger cock all the time. So yeah, it was a man. The man caves did it. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Well, how do those two sentences connect? I Dunno. I Dunno.

Speaker 7:          00:45:55       I know I'm not alone here. Right? I'm high, but I'm not retarded.

Speaker 6:          00:46:02       I don't like this. Sometimes you just got to nod with birth.

Speaker 7:          00:46:07       It's weird how quickly he turns it to black cock. You know, like no matter what the topic is, so it's finding the house threatening.

Speaker 6:          00:46:16       Oh,

Speaker 7:          00:46:18       fear is funny. It's always been funny. Fucking always wobbling. Joe. Speaking of beer, rule of Holy Shit. Is he going to win? Pennsylvania know we're out of the ass is funny. That's the first rule of comedy. Yeah. Back in the day. Oh, this is a scary, it's Pennsylvania's looking mostly red. We got to get Donald Trump on mushrooms. We can turn this bitch around. Yeah, we did turn this bitch around. Pennsylvania has not been called, but it is right now. 49% Clinton, 47% Trump outside of a child molester. A murder is not irredeemable. Right? This is certain Polina, bring them back. Just six six to 10 dried grams in an isolation tank.

Speaker 6:          00:47:05       Donald,

Speaker 7:          00:47:06       we don't, we don't ask a lot of you, but we asked this one journey show on my phone. I'm just seeing what man's instruct. Any fucking idea how awesome that would be if we get Donald Trump trippin

Speaker 6:          00:47:20       where are you? Feed Go. I'm so sorry, but look, now we can fix it. We can all fix it together. We're

Speaker 7:          00:47:29       us now. Not then. Have you given up? No, I haven't given up a view like this is fun. People are fun. I love people. Life is awesome. Even if the things bullshit, I voted. It's probably bullshit.

Speaker 6:          00:47:46       This will be the first time I didn't vote for the winner. Oh yeah. I voted for the winter every time. That's right. Bush twice

Speaker 7:          00:47:55       money on board once. I don't know how many times he did it. Well, if you'd have really voted for the winter, you would have voted for Gore the first time.

Speaker 6:          00:48:03       No, I take that back. I take that back. That's the only time I didn't vote and I was on a TV show, the x show, and I said out loud on this TV. I was like, my vote doesn't count. I'm not voting. Everyone don't vote besides, it's a right in vote from Florida and literally actually counted, but not in bed by 86 or something. But you ruined the future that is now

Speaker 7:          00:48:30       Al Gore won by a half a million votes in the popular vote. That's how you know the system's broken. That's how a lot of fucking people, a half a million people die in a fire. And it's the worst tragedy in American history people. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But at half a million, that's a lot of fucking human beings chose him over Bush and our system's so fucked up that it doesn't recognize that discrepancy that somehow or another, your patch of dirt is more significant than you as an individual and us as a collective that can share ideas.

I know I was a male stripper for a day on, on my, one of my TV shows at as Gay Strip club and uh, and it, you look much better than you normally do cause you, you're all your shits up front. Like it's selling a car. And so, uh, it's like a pushup bra fee. A job. Yeah, exactly. Exactly what it's like

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       pushup Bra for your time. I deejayed one of those fucking Bachelorette parties one time and a guy came out and the chick pulled his pants down and he had fucking rubber band around his cock and balls, like a poor man's cock ring full on. And he, he went, he went fucking crazy. He was like, fuck you, you don't touch me. And he went nuts because he just had small package with rubber bands like just paper. I call them paper route. He'll be there one day.

Speaker 6:          01:00:36       Oh, I read a horrible

Speaker 7:          01:00:37       and how a guy cut his own dick off online because it's just falls off in his dick off. And the way he did it was first he killed it by tying it off. So he, he he documented it was the early, early days. The Internet when we were just starting to go, what the fuck I get in the the like the late nineties early two thousands there was a website called [inaudible]. It's like body modification, extreme Mary, you guys remember that time, applause break and a shelf applause break like bring it back. Youth organization called friends when the guy ran the site was dead is dead now, but he was into like really crazy shit. Like yeah, online friends who he sent me his book. We used to send emails back and forth. He's a very smart guy. First email, first of all is because he site where people like, yeah themselves up and cut their dicks apart or whatever.

Speaker 7:          01:01:33       Yeah. Like fifth for cares shits, friendships start well because I was, I wrote a blog, I wrote a blog, I wrote a blog and I was mocking something that someone did that was ridiculous. Like some guy who grew his fingernails or the longest in the world and he lost control of his left arm. Like his nerves died in his left arm because he has these fingernails that are like seven feet long and he never cuts them. And I wrote this whole thing about it and this guy emailed me back about body modification and it was like, he's really intelligent response just to let you know, this is why people do weird shit. Like this is the psychological components of it. I wrote a website, they want to be a sponsor on your potty. No, no, I had no podcast. This was 1997 so anyway, he, the guys gives me a free password to his site so I could see what's going on and I just check out all these people that are having these weird fucking bolts screwed into the top of their head and cut in their ears and split and their tongues and doing all this freaky shit and I go down the rabbit hole as you do, you keep clicking links and I found this one dude who decided he didn't want his dick in his balls anymore.

Speaker 7:          01:02:35       He had some weird relationship with his boyfriend was boyfriends like that Dick is useless. You're going to cut it off. He's like, yes, master, and he's this guy ties rubber bands around his dick until there's no circulation in his dick and balls. It all goes black. He photographs it and takes a documented blog, needs a rubber band and not have circulation in their penis.

Speaker 10:         01:03:05       I think it's a different, it's a cell death.

Speaker 7:          01:03:07       It's type of constriction we're dealing with. It's not as simple as a, your dick doesn't get hard. It's like as much more complicated shit going on, please necrosis. Anyway, the dude documented cutting off his own cock and balls and like photos of the video out.

Speaker 7:          01:13:49       Finally. We don't have to feel like we're fucking criminals for doing something that doesn't even hurt you.

Speaker 4:          01:13:54       It's so stupid. That leads to heroin and fucking other things.

Speaker 7:          01:14:03       Best Gateway drug for me is alcohol.

Speaker 16:         01:14:05       I wonder if they're going to smoke weed in pornos while not wearing condoms.

Speaker 4:          01:14:10       I Dunno if the condom thing has passed has

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       it, but that's, that's a good joke. Is it weird if on the condom thing I wrote in Gary Johnson

Speaker 5:          01:14:25       didn't really get an answer there. I guess instead of instead of using condoms, you have to use Johnson weld. It sounds like some kind of Dick Repair Kit doesn't it? Five seconds after what happened? Who did you drop the trap? Oh, how dare you there. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Mark, Bert, Bert, Bert. All right. Just to recap. One 97 to one 87 Hillary, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Too early to call and other than that, everything else is mustard color. I feel like this was frozen. Yeah, this is frozen. Frozen.

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:15:19       Hey guys, they're really committed to that mannequin challenge. It's been frozen for three hours. I was like, Wolf Blitzer is really thinking about this point. Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:15:27       True.

Speaker 5:          01:15:30       I said the funniest thing nobody got. How do you, how do you, how do you reset this? So you go like this?

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       Yeah, that's it.

Speaker 5:          01:15:39       You're blowing your thought. Well, there's no fucking mouse. There's nothing on this thing. It's fucking sufficient. Hi, Trump won Florida. Trump won New Hampshire. You got Florida. What does it say? What's the score man? Two 16 to one 97 Trump two 61 97 Brandon [inaudible]. He's got a kickoff to Hillary and to his fucking old Washington. Brendan Walsh. I know you kind of a prankster, but you're also a very smart guy. Yeah. Like I know you did. Would you be happier if one of these people, one and we were, is this, I mean, you know, this is, this is shattering my world because I'm such a conspiracy nut. I just thought like they got fucking, I was like, well, they want Hillary to be president, so they got the craziest fucking monster to run against her and now my whole world's being shattered because it looked like I've been wrong all these years, that it's, the elections aren't fucking rig from top to bottom.

Speaker 5:          01:16:37       I think they, they rig it to a certain extent, but there's only so much they could do without being really obvious. Mean you can have. Yeah, because there's a bunch of people that want to run it all. They just can't get up, get all, get on the same page. Trumps the one that said it was rigged and now he's about to win this shit. I know. That's amazing. But he kind of proved it was along the way along with wikileaks exposing what they did, trying to do the forced Bernie Sanders out. Yeah. Like they actively conspired in their own party to keep this guy from winning. Like they, they're like, fuck that dude. I got to say all you pussies

Speaker 11:         01:17:10       who kept voting for Hillary should have gone with Bernie, should have gone party pussies. Sarah Silverman was right. That shit when they were like, no, if you actually believed in her, fine, but I just eat food. But those people who were just like this, no way this guy can win. So you're going to vote for someone who goes to those Bilderberg meetings when they, when they dress up like facets and they fuck each other. Yeah. That's your fucking hope. I got it.

Speaker 7:          01:17:35       Be Honest. Is One clear way that I'm sexist. I don't mind if someone calls it due to Dick, but like when you talk about a pussy in a bad way, like ah, to pussy, look what, what is it about that that's less Kona due to pussy? Well, anybody a pussy, like pussies. Pretty good.

Speaker 10:         01:17:52       Pretty good. Thanks.

Speaker 7:          01:17:55       But if, uh, if someone

Speaker 15:         02:02:15       Yeah. Why isn't it when you, when you take Pi entering Colorado come a criminal, why do we need states? States are like

Speaker 5:          02:02:32       this glorified boundaries in between lines of dirt. We arbitrarily draw and decide, well, we're used to ride with feathers. They just thought this was Wyoming. I can't go there with my fucking gay porn and people would get mad at me. Throw me in a fucking prison. That's ridiculous, right? It is ridiculous, but it's great. It's a great feeling up. Your progress as you drive across the country. America, you need them really good point markers. We retained the name and we just abandoned the idea. We can't all decide collectively without electoral colleges, without senators and representative. We don't need representatives. We don't ride horses. We have

Speaker 10:         02:14:57       Oh, first lady flotus. Was I supposed to know that float? That's what Trump's going to call his haircut tomorrow. Give me a very interesting subject group. Lotus. Lotus, right? Yeah. Do you know what flotus and did you immediately recognize it? Did you know what I'm saying? Let's do that. You say that still wants to engage in romantic relationships. Flotus and potency. This is all important. Hello? You recognize photos? Yes. Yeah, I know. When he comes to see, oh, where's the Joe Rogan's wife? I paid for Rogan know if you're the fucking wife. Just that's what he's saying is it's a weird gig to be the first lady until Joe, but I'm going on chill. That's till fucking wife of the guy matter. Exactly. That's that Michelle Obama for president. Fuck it.

Speaker 18:         02:16:02       Are you saying he's saying the president?

Speaker 10:         02:16:07       Oh, they know. Why isn't the president

Speaker 18:         02:16:12       never heard either one of their policies? Just what color is their blouse? Are you saying that the wife of the president of the United States? Doesn't matter. I'm saying that Michelle Obama, the current wife should run for president. No. Absolutely. Why? Because she danced Allen.

Speaker 12:         02:16:32       Oh,

Speaker 18:         02:16:34       the wife of the president versus the actually running the country is so fucking different fucking break dude. And you're out there crushing it and arenas you. Your husband should then go do is fucking stand up. Cause he hollered a notebook. It's not different. This whole fucking thing with these first ladies fucking low picking a damn cause and all of a sudden my presidential is fucking ridiculous. It's not ridiculous. Ridiculous was women have an opinion and we talk in your ear all the time. Are you telling me that when you designed your house it was all your decision has nothing. It has nothing to do with signing that you can go onto or wherever the fuck you want and your wife is like what it has to do with is actually doing the job, doing the job. There was a nurse I hung. I was just like him out. I was, my mother was a nurse at home with her from my whole fucking life. Okay. If someone came into the ICU unit, I didn't know what the fuck to do. Well that's because you are fucking around with her with scrubs. You're not trained as a nurse. Barack Obama is a lawyer and so is Michelle. That's not a politician, but it doesn't matter like he wasn't a politician when he got elected. That was the whole thing. No, no, no.

Speaker 18:         02:17:59       You're talking about going from never being a politician to the highest fucking office ever. Exactly what Trump is doing. Exactly what form you fucking lunatic.

Speaker 4:          02:18:11       That is sexist shit right there. I didn't say I didn't stay there. That is the bullshit. That is bullshit.

Speaker 18:         02:18:24       I was a white knight and I was trying to fuck Stair Tiana. I'd be yelling at you right now. Bill. Burn. It's fucking bullshit. I'll wait till you're done. If you do think, oh cool. Who is that billionaire

Speaker 2:          02:18:40       [inaudible] do you think

Speaker 4:          02:18:52       time he took his shirt off. We reacted to it.

Speaker 18:         02:19:02       Who's that fucking dope? Who fucked up New York City? Just cause he had $1 billion. He was never an office. Do you think that? Yeah, that fucking guy jerk off total fucking shirt off and he's got his desk. So there you go. Mrs Bloom back. Well it doesn't, no, I'm saying that guy, that guy was a jerk off and he actually transcended the state constitution and was like, fuck it. I'm not. Then being in the fucking guy here and continued on. That was bullshit. And this is the thing. If you fucking do the thing about all of this shit is if you criticize Hillary, it means automatically you're a sexist. I didn't say that. I just said that the first lady voted for Trump. If Hillary was really no words in my mouth, that's not what I said. I'm putting what you said. You said that someone with no experience can't take on the highest office of the world.

Speaker 18:         02:19:58       And I said, but Trump just did that. That's all I said. Trump has had no experience and he's going to take over in the orbit. That's all I was the point I was making. I was not saying, I don't understand what your point is. Why is Hillary is no different than a reality TV show stars, ladies. That's like what your point. You said the first lady right now, Michelle Obama could never be president because you can't go from a no experience to running the biggest office in the world. I said I disagree because that's why 100% never said that. I, that's what I thought you said June 1st I mean once you inferred. I don't think so. I'm, I'm almost positive. I just reacted to what you said so we can rewind it, but if you did it, you did it. So you have a Twitter handle. Hold on, hold on. We got voted and like she would have to run. I never said any of that. All I said was the first lady has experienced

Speaker 10:         02:21:05       fence. Oh good. How long were you said was you guys to be in dispute? You're both.

Speaker 18:         02:21:13       We're not. We're just disagreeing guys. The point that I'm making, if you're married to someone not in the field that you're in, does not make you qualified to do that job. That's all I just said.

Speaker 10:         02:21:27       If you're married to a, to a guy who built houses and you don't build houses, that doesn't mean that I want to live in something that you just fucking built. That's all I'm saying. You know, you make some good points there. Yeah. Kind of. You'd like to say, oh, Whoa, Whoa, Sarah. Tiana would also like to speak.

Speaker 18:         02:21:44       Well, I'm just saying that like, of course you're saying that if she is Jesse because you're married to somebody with a job. I feel, I feel like, I feel like I'm listening to somebody. Talk about where the Cleveland Indians were the best team in baseball last year.

Speaker 10:         02:22:06       I mean it's already pretty much, no, no. This is where Bob Backlund was better than red is super fly snuck up.

Speaker 18:         02:22:12       Wow. No, this is where I paid regular friends. Everybody knows is Bob Backlund cliff.

Speaker 10:         02:22:17       It's a not two teams is not team ps and team. Vagina and he can't stay you jail. Okay.

Speaker 11:         02:22:25       Yeah. I was trying to transcend this fucking horse shit of what is your genitalia? This is therefore what you think. That's all I was trying to try and set. Okay.

Speaker 10:         02:22:38       Brought up a good point that we do. If you don't know how to do the job, why do we have democracy? Why are we voting? We're fucking all dumb on this panel.

Speaker 15:         02:22:51       No,

Speaker 10:         02:22:53       the paid to be here,

Speaker 15:         02:22:56       so not true.

Speaker 10:         02:23:01       Wait fucking smarter than me. Looking at me right now. Going all right.

Speaker 15:         02:23:07       I, for one, when I say we're totally qualified to be talking about this, I think we're good. I don't know why anyone would question the opinions. This real quick,

Speaker 10:         02:23:18       Doug, you're a victim of your own scouts. Hey, you're beautiful. You are my favorite people that's ever walked the face of the planet. You're up there with king is Tom Neighbor, Abraham Lincoln's, so settle the fuck down. Are you calling me a mud? Race

Speaker 15:         02:23:35       trains

Speaker 10:         02:23:39       the fucking step people. People lives in this depth and lived in felt tense. My point was that democracy is flawed in that idiots can vote. We're saying they can run to what they do. They know what they do, but we vote for that. Right. Honest question. What's the solution? Well, that's dumb before I called you dumb, dumb. Really? There's no way I barely can keep putting that. Paying attention to what the fuck I'm doing. I don't know what you do.

Speaker 11:         02:24:06       You know what I think the solution is? We just have to wait for idiots to die and we have to hope that like smarter people keep getting born.

Speaker 15:         02:24:14       That's true. That's why the Duggar's need to be executed. We're not going anywhere else there. I just had two daughters. You're part of the problem. It's narrow. Tiana

Speaker 10:         02:24:27       necessarily disagree with you, but I think even those people that just a victim of circumstance. Shit. Hillary won Nevada.

Speaker 15:         02:24:40       What were the odds on that? Two 38 to 15 going into the fourth quarter. Hillary's so excited with it had passed out. Trump has [inaudible] ma'am.

Speaker 10:         02:24:53       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:24:54       There's no waiting for Pennsylvania. They have a called Wisconsin yet, right? They haven't called Wisconsin. They have, but it's not looking at that. We call Pennsylvania. Here's what she asked again. What are their options? Is it easy? She has to get Wisconsin. If she gets like the mustard colored sticks.

Speaker 15:         02:25:13       You know what's really scary, Michigan? I don't know what's going on, dude. I didn't know I was going to be in front of the computer. No, no.

Speaker 10:         02:25:20       We already know that we are a little children got older. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         02:25:24       Yeah. And this is what this fucking system is based on. Little children that got older back when they used to ride horses.

Speaker 6:          02:25:30       That's so Meta. It's real head Israel. No, I love it. You're so right. I never rode a horse

Speaker 14:         02:25:36       to this whole fucking thing. Like there's a long history of the United States. People lived to be a hundred years. The United States was founded in 1776 that's three people ago.

Why don't you just sponsor people who want to move from this country? Why don't you sponsor people's trips out of the advocate? That's the smartest move. Cause honestly, when it, the hardest thing is finding someone to help you move. We found one bit, I'm sorry. No, it's fine. Yeah. There's a microphone there, so, and you'll get selected. Yeah. Okay. We're going to pay. Yeah. Pay for them to leave. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. It's a really good concept. Yeah. There you go. Right.

Speaker 18:         02:29:06       His money. Where his mouth, I dunno.

Speaker 7:          02:29:08       Sarah Tiana. Do you lean right or lean left? Do you seem like a chick with a gun?

Speaker 18:         02:29:12       Uh, no. No. I'm terrified of guns. I am. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't understand. Like my brother in law has a bunch of them and I'm always like, why do you need them? He's like, I'll go to protect this house. I'm like, but nobody wants her DVD player. You know what I mean? Like, I don't know. I don't understand, but I also don't understand, like I don't mind the shotgun because my dad had a shotgun when we growing up we ate the food. He killed that one time, you know? So it was fun. But I don't like semiautomatic weapons. I think they're weird. There should be limitations on how symptoms. Yeah, because I feel like, don't you feel like the same person that buzzes semiautomatic weapon is the same person that buys a Ferrari jacket? It's a fair, it's a fair question. Like you're like, I don't know. That seems excessive in early man. When I was listening to that on Netflix and I go, I dunno. I Dunno what this, I don't know what the, um, the answer is.

Speaker 7:          02:30:11       Who were for Ryan racing shoes. Shoes,

But I like, I, that's what I feel like now. I feel like I was like nine years deep into, into a pack out and like, then he got bit like it's, I don't know, I just find out about things sooner than other people. It makes me better. Well you know about what you know about old shit too, you know a little bit like you know, I dunno like basic shit. Full House. You and I had a conversation about the ram. Yeah. Yeah. We had a long Durang conversation. I used to fly out. I would, I would do overnight from work and I would fly out to see glove. I saw Golovkin fight like a Fox sports for like 2:00 AM fight.

Speaker 19:         02:31:23       And I was like, who's this guy? And I went to every American fight he had until he was like famous. Now I can't afford to go anymore, but I would fly out overnight. I bumped into La Wanda Sykes on a plane and we were both like lesbians going to, uh, I'm not lesbian, but I it seem like I am based on every pay based on everything. I like saying do I seem like I'm a lesbian but it's, it's a for, everybody thinks that too. Cause we look good and blazers and they're like, oh sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry I have a house.

Speaker 18:         02:31:50       Sing it. I'll be there in a way because you're like serious fucking assholes. It. You keep saying all these states are too close to call, so I call them. They're spent two 38 50 it's like a fucking hour isn't it? It's too late to call them like Pennsylvania. I don't understand. It's too late to call. You sound like my mom. It's like, it's like fun. No one in the morning, one of the junkies. What do you think Hillary and and Trump are doing right now? What? What do you think Hillary and Trump are doing right now? Each Other?

Speaker 10:         02:32:25       No. [inaudible] 69 that's the only way triplets. Somebody suck his dick that way. They don't look at his head. I don't think Trump is,

Speaker 19:         02:32:37       Trump is in like jerking off to celebrate. He's jerking off to relax cause he's completely freaked out right now that any of this is happening. I don't think he, I don't think he, I don't know if he wanted it. I don't know if he's,

Speaker 10:         02:32:47       that's what you say. All of a sudden you're living in Brentwood and you're back walls made out of glass and you drive a Ferrari and the guy at the fucking local coffee bean gets a coke today. My trainers, no, you're a producer. Producer works on movies and ain't going nowhere. So you constantly deal with desperate people and you're giving them coke and driving around in a Ferrari. So your fucking house, the glass windows. Just because I think positively. It doesn't make me sell out. Yes. What happens?

Speaker 19:         02:33:23       I said just because I think positively it does make me a sell out. I thought I thought he liked was fucking around.

Speaker 18:         02:33:29       Yeah, right. You didn't think he was fucking around in the beginning. Trump like just throwing his name. Real conversation. We have to affect the guy doesn't really have a plan. He's having to make this fucking great. Why are you gonna do that? Oh, you'll see. It doesn't really sound like a plan after giving an answer. It's time out. We just kept riding it. It's fucking astounding. It's the most amazing thing I've ever fucking seen. We're here. We're here losing. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         02:34:01       T and I still blame him for ruining my life. You were good. You did a good job. You did a good job. So you know what? Do we have a precedent? You did guys. Guys calm down here after the who did what announcement. I got know who's on what before I keep talking. I don't even remember. Brendon was leaving God damn magician to me. I'm like, where's better less went to him. I went to him to fucking IPAD, put it down on a table. The fucking scream. They got a black guy or white guy with white hair. Jesus Christ. Diversity in the house. Good resident. His hair's gonna change presidents. Harris Change. He'll take you. The emails had to do with this. How much you think the emails

Speaker 6:          02:34:58       I have affected this election. No, no, no, no. I'm going to jump into this. It's fun. It's liberals. Liberals have ruined this. They are the ones that fuck this up. Oh they made, they made, they made these sherbet of farmers feel like they didn't have a voice and then all of a sudden they rose back up and they were like, fuck you with your hand crafted shoes from Brooklyn and, and, and that is what I'm telling you. I'm saying this from friends from Florida who voted for Trump. They just feel like they don't have a voice. You get in trouble if you say something a little racist or a little sexist and that and that man serious. If you're a regular person, you get fired. And that is what, fuck this up. If liberals is just being cool, like just be like, all right, cool. We'll just won't say the n word. Like then we'd all

Speaker 13:         02:35:42       correct. This is the new McCarthy.

Speaker 10:         02:35:44       Is it? Okay Doug, stand out. Who are they? Burn you. You talk about them. But we're fed this shit from the media. Yeah. Act like the gifts, not our social circle. No. See your friends were upset that they couldn't be racist or sexist and they felt like they didn't have a voice to it. If you voted for a reality TV show star to be the leader of the free world. Super Sad. Don't you guys all wish that Anderson Cooper was laying his head in John King's lap on CNN right now? I wish this is true political analysis right here. I wish I knew who the fuck John King was. I would laugh at that. I had a bag. Oh yeah. Yeah, that'd be fucking hilarious. Google, if you, if you look at was talking sandy hair, hair

Speaker 13:         02:36:34       guy earlier. We're burst on the fucking, he's got the shit going on. He'll show you John King.

Speaker 10:         02:36:40       No, this thing is like magic. It's like that. The screen is not connected to the keyboard, but it all works. You say anything? I don't get like kind of fuck like that. I can do that. Like how does that work? Hey guys, we don't have headphones on, so if we talk over each other, do you guys talk over each other? That's going to be a disaster for it would been a great point. Three hours ago. I'm sorry.

Speaker 12:         02:37:09       Oh, okay.

Speaker 10:         02:37:10       All right. We give all the money to bill burns. Come on, man. He's got gotta meet. Bilberry is going

Speaker 7:          02:37:15       to give it to some awesome charities and smart guy. How funny is it? There's a blonde lady next to the blackest guy that's ever been on TV in the last 10 years and then next to each other talking about the news. It looks like a health insurance best. That guy lower cage from Netflix. I was out there kicking ass. He's a fucking, you look at him as the God damn barbarian. That guy is built like a fucking savage,

Speaker 11:         02:37:37       Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. Still too close to call. I feel like we're having so much fun in here,

Speaker 4:          02:37:45       but outside, close to cough. Just fucking eating through people at the mall. I just came from outside. I left the 12 just terrified people at my house to come here tonight. You're just at your house. They're at my house. Interior like people are having tears. Honestly, somebody who's crying on my deck tonight thinking they were going to

Speaker 11:         02:38:20       God. You know what I mean? You didn't win an election. You're going to start fucking crying. Go Rake. You fucking leaves.

Speaker 4:          02:38:25       Nice people who have Obamacare. Who's the fucking clouds. Chrysler gets up. Seriously. Liberals need to toughen. I, I mean, I lean left and we left. They're right now. He just wants with the tambourine, this is like, I know, but it's not, it's not the voice like it matters a little bit more. If you lose that takes up and you're going to be fine. No. Yes, you're right. You're going to be fine. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         02:39:00       thank done. No, it's such a disease to think that my, the person had on a blue shirt, now my life's going to be better then, I don't know. Red fucking bow or whatever. Whatever the fuck the checks put in their hair, they're going to fucking win. Yeah. Just, you're going to be fine. You make your own opportunity. You pull yourself up by your own fucking bootstraps. The end of the day, you don't worry American Belton. Right.

Speaker 7:          02:39:24       But we're all given. Some people had given like a one, three, another dude gets to aces. Right? We get lucky. We all do.

Speaker 11:         02:39:32       The guy with two aces doesn't give a shit and he's never gone to. And when you're an adult and you realize that and you play the one in the three and do what the fuck this, that's you. That's your best bet. To try to get someone with two fucking asis to give a fuck. Is this the desk basically a trust fund kid to get them to give a shit about anybody below someone who just owns a Chili's, forget about the people who work there. It's fucking impossible.

Speaker 7:          02:39:58       Most likely, most likely, depending upon how they're raised by their parents. If they get really lucky and they find a conscientious parent, it tries to explain to them things, they'll get a more nuanced perspective of life, but they're never to have the same perspective as a guy like Mike Tyson. He grows up in a horrible neighborhood and learns how to just be the best of the best with a fury that you cannot stop and that is only awarded to people that are suppressed. There's this weird thing that happens with human beings when we're suppressed. When added that emerges is very bizarre. Intense, like almost Super Nova type energy that you see from people like Eddie Murphy or Richard Pryor or Chris Rock. There's a lot of them. Right?

Speaker 11:         02:40:43       I'll Trump Greg Fitzsimmons sorry, bring away to the Joe. You guys just weren't there. Sorry.

Speaker 18:         02:40:51       Can I say that? Uh, have you heard that study about like, you know how they tried to figure out like if everybody eat, they always say like anybody can be president of the United States, right? Like anybody, everybody in America has the same opportunities. But what they've found is that some people have one opportunity and other people have many opportunities and that's the difference. So are you saying the world is unfair?

Speaker 11:         02:41:21       No, but you're saying you're saying 100% agree with you. The world is

Speaker 18:         02:41:35       fair, but what you're expecting is people have the advantage to take the time to have the, the, the, the maturity to give a shit. They're not going to do it. That's not what I'm expecting. That we have not been connected since the second you said 50% of it. I'll take 49

Speaker 7:          02:41:53       great example. The Oscars. Watch the Oscars right? They're always talking about more and more diversity, but it never changes because you're asking for somebody to give up their nomination or their seat in the fucking show and they're never going to fucking do it because they're cool change for everybody else as long as they get there and that's why I won't fucking, it's very hard to get anybody changed. Could you ask him the sacrifice

Speaker 18:         02:42:15       because they're selfish.

Speaker 11:         02:42:16       It's good. It's good to teach. Somebody has on a yellow dress on CNN. Beautiful. Don't you guys think that famine thinking

Speaker 7:          02:42:26       because there's a limited, there's a limited ability to communicate with people you didn't know just recently.

Speaker 11:         02:42:33       Hey, what is some 20 years ago? What is some gum like? The flavor lasts for fucking ever and then other gum, it's like it's gone in a minute. It's like, it's like the boy band a gum like, oh my God, this is fucking amazing. And then is, how do you feel about that gum gum gum squirt comes, it's not that it's sports, the freaks me out. It's just not, it doesn't taste good. Powerful. It's like mouthwash and the gum.

Speaker 7:          02:43:02       Tell us about your experience

Speaker 18:         02:43:04       work because at the beginning it's just so good, you know, and then it just kind of wears off and you're like, well, I just need to buy

Speaker 11:         02:43:11       more gum. Are you all right? You're getting New Hampshire [inaudible] still too close to call. You make tanker holaps though. You're killing right now. I stance as a crowd and as we got a score in the back

Speaker 15:         02:43:31       2021 yeah.

Speaker 11:         02:43:36       I don't know what that means, but I'll take it for some reason. That was a Bruins Tampa Bay score to me. I thought you said stamp zoos have some crazy fucking score going on in the back. That's okay too. Iphone guy. What do you got? I still got to 38 to 15 what do you got? Hello? Trump. Oh, come on. Whoa. Then one of the fucking pillar, the red pillar in the corner. Loving it. He's going to make his life, Craig. Oh, bullshit aside. I'll fill all Donald Trump's going to call you tomorrow.

Speaker 15:         02:44:13       How weird does this feel?

Speaker 11:         02:44:16       Hey, you got to admit this motherfucker in the corner. Nobody thought it was going to be this close. This is insane.

Speaker 15:         02:44:22       Who says it's awesome for real dude,

Speaker 11:         02:44:27       my friend? No, judge, this is what you have to think. Bill Burns is the guy right there is said is this, I'm not going to, I'm at camp. I can't say to these people, Shit that might happen. Hold on.

Speaker 15:         02:44:40       I want to hear this dude talk. What? It's like a town hall.

Speaker 11:         02:44:49       Yeah, family. Just like a ton town hall, but nobody knows the issues. So it's a town hall. Call it today. You want to go to the booth. If you stick your card in each tank, going over all the different things that you agree with or don't agree with, you go, ah, I should have fucking probably studied this. Hey Dude, look at all this shit. I was like, um, schools. Well, how much do, well, how much do they need when they ask it for? I don't know how the fuck the parameters are. Okay. Did you guys already know? But how'd they get on death row? The fuck they do. I don't know. These dudes, you know something if you actually researched it, it's still just as cause confusing. I'm sure cause I looked at all, I had all my shy, my cheat sheet. I was in and out in 30 seconds but like every fucking amendment was just like, hey this is a man men to make sure the sun doesn't burn out and then we need the sun to heat the earth. You're like, yeah, I'm for this. And then the next thing would be the argument. It can be like, actually this doesn't prevent the sun from burning out. It's the exact opposite. This is pouring water on the sun and by the end of it you're just like I don't, I don't know who do I believe. And then you just look at who was Ford Nra, Ed Begley Jr. It was all over the same day. I knew like who agrees with this? Who does this disagree with? And that's what you went with. That

Speaker 19:         02:46:10       was it. But I hate all my shit lined up. I was looking at all the answers to the test and I would just flip the page. Two Up, two down, one up, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam. Right? Just want to go to the airport. I'm ready to go right through the security line. You guys have a lot of people telling you this federation for the person behind check. Were you with a lot of people with their kids? Oh, sorry. Or You with a lot of people with their kids voting today. There was a little girl who liked over explained like how the vote,

Speaker 6:          02:46:39       how many people were drinking soda chips in it were volunteering. Oh really? Like this is some weird poisoning we're watching and it's a delicious poison.

Speaker 19:         02:46:48       Right? Did people behind me were dragging a, the people behind me were drinking like a homemade smoothies and cups with like glass straws and I was like, oh, this isn't, we're not going the way my line is. It's like I brought my,

Speaker 6:          02:47:05       wait, can I ask a question for those who voted in la? Yeah. Were you guys like like 90% yeses with like five nos?

Speaker 19:         02:47:15       No, I had a lot of no's.

Speaker 6:          02:47:17       I had no nose leave then what do you mean no for nothing? I figured and then and then when you picked your judges and third question is actual human beings. You can't just yes and no. No, no, no, no. I mean I'm just saying it like for all the things I voted no with the condoms and then yes and no the condoms. But like I was predominantly know what the tobacco tax, right? No, no, no, no. I bought a dance with them.

Speaker 19:         02:47:43       I bought it. Yes. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a heavy, I'll say I'm a heavy smoker. I voted yes on the tobacco town. Was another one about building up the schools and it was presented by the builders and like those crooked flux. Yeah. Fuck them. Morgan one. Yeah. I said, I am a, I'm a, I'm a heavy smoker. I voted yes on the tobacco tax. Whoa. I did. No, I think more money should go to research the shit that I'm doing to myself as I'm smoking. Like that's how I feel. I do. I feel like I would like to get older and find out I have something they already cured. Honestly. Energy, drinks and cigarettes of stunted my growth. I feel great. I voted for the Armenian. Oh Hey, he's got to go to billboard on Virgil. I like him. You guys all the no on the condoms thing. Yeah. No condoms. No ICAD. Debs. What'd you vote? I voted yes.

Speaker 20:         02:48:44       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          02:48:50       love it.

Speaker 19:         02:48:52       Well because I think uh, porn is ruining men and I think that if, if, if,

Speaker 4:          02:49:04       no, she's and how she's right.

Speaker 18:         02:49:08       I get it. Cause I voted, I voted, I'm sorry. I think that the one thing that porn is doing is like not making men like go out and try to be like fucking like pickup chicks. And I feel like if they stopped watching porn and tried to be resourceful, that would be fucking pornography. No Man to try their thing. She wants to get hit on. I thought it was, she cared about. No, that's not it. Millennials are having less sex than their parents. Like guys don't want to go out and just start a curious, just out of curiosity, how could they possibly know if millennials are having less sex than their past? How do you know they do research? How to times you've been on the fucking mall and somebody goes, can you stop right now? I want to take this survey. Anybody intelligent? I got shit to do. Slice. I can tell you I voted. I think like just young kids are just not interested in video games and Netflix and porn and like why would they want to go out and fucking meet women? I voted no. I'm not saying they need to meet me, meet me spitting in each other's mouths

Speaker 5:          02:50:52       with the women in his life and he wants just release. I'm fine with that. His testicles influencing my decision. Are you released and it helps to man. Sometimes if you watch other people, fuck,

Speaker 18:         02:51:13       I understand that, but I think every patient,

Speaker 5:          02:51:21       everything in excess including washing your fucking hands, you've got no still too close to call people's 10 times a day you need a hug.

Speaker 18:         02:51:27       Well, I just think Elvis sudden it makes the porn straight like what they're doing going on. It was pushes it further underground and makes it more dangerous so the girls have to have sex in worse places. That's all. Does he ever go get rid of

Speaker 5:          02:51:47       your freedom of speech? L Know your thoughts? I'm trying. I'm trying to yell, but no, I'm, I'm against it. I'm sorry Sarah. I don't mean I'm not afraid. Let's go dirtier. Let's go fucking release

Speaker 15:         02:52:06       it to Joe and after it's done, you go. All right. Whatever.

Speaker 16:         02:52:12       Alaska, it's still too early to call. No,

Speaker 15:         02:52:15       I don't give a fuck. I'm talking about making pizza.

Speaker 14:         02:52:18       Well, I'll get him. Let us meet you. Absolutely.

Speaker 16:         02:52:27       Ellen, do you watch porn stare or are you going to watch boring?

Speaker 14:         02:52:34       He doesn't watch porn anymore.

Speaker 16:         02:52:36       See, I have a theory. It's the people that feel the one condoms in porn or like people that say they hate Kanya. You just don't watch porn. You just don't listen to rap. If you wasn't a wrap, then you love con. Everybody wants to hate on Kanye and hate on condoms. They're very close.

Speaker 15:         02:52:52       No Tony Hitch

Speaker 14:         02:52:54       to if I've got a theory, I think a person can only watch so many people fucking this whole lifetime and I think Sarah overdosed long time ago.

Speaker 16:         02:53:00       Yeah, Sarah's been, Sarah has been like over protective. She says like two condoms on her entire life.

Speaker 14:         02:53:06       She specialized in black dudes wear timberlands like jump out of helicopters in this girls and they're run into the snow and they tripped and the pants fall down.

Speaker 16:         02:53:17       The only magnum I want to see, the only magnum I want to see in a porno is a big black guy. Fucking a dirty white trash white girl named magnum.

Speaker 18:         02:53:29       I Dunno. I mean all I know, all I know is my experience with it and that and my experience

Speaker 15:         02:53:37       shopping them out. I'm going to be honest, Tony fucked it up.

Speaker 18:         02:53:42       You guys can all hate me. It's just like,

Speaker 15:         02:53:45       oh, nobody hates you.

Speaker 18:         02:53:50       I'm not backing down from my position. I just think that there's too much porn out there and it's making guys thing that women want to do those positions and every time I'm with a new guy, the new guy in my, what are you doing?

Speaker 15:         02:54:04       The romantic comedies where guys run through airports and fuck it, I'm going to take the next several shades of gray was the biggest selling book in the history of fucking human beings. Okay. It brought back were we're running down a row. Yes. Crazy, crazy bitches across the globe when asking random dudes and spit them out, do you understand what the fuck happened? One person wrote a crazy book to cracked. That's so true. It's like we got to keep that door shut.

Speaker 18:         02:54:47       The lady that's all that. I just think that it's more interesting to not try to push me in certain positions that I can do anymore. I think a really good point. Yeah. I just think it gives men a negative imagery and a false of what a woman's body is like and instead of paying attention to what I need and what I want porn and then you can't get off and then they can't get off because they're just thinking about Sa. They can't in your circumstance, but that's what part is. I'm just telling you it's all I can think that's what porn is though. Porn is a false imagery. It's just something. Yeah. Just like Sam said, it's a romantic comedy. It's a, it's the, why not do it. Oh Jesus.

Speaker 15:         02:55:28       Yeah. For, for, come on guys. Let's get off of this. Let's just get off. I just want to be honest with you people. This might be the greatest thing I've ever been a part of my, put this thing together.

Speaker 18:         02:55:54       Come on, sit down. Sit down. What are you trying to do? Come sit with us. All right. I Dunno. I Dunno what the fuck is going on in the country right now, but it's still to answer her fucking, it's two 38 to 15 to 15 yup. That's, it's still that. What are you doing? You can't,

Speaker 6:          02:56:17       no, no, no. He's not calling anybody.

Speaker 18:         02:56:19       This will be a good time for like a raffle or auction off. Do you guys, what do we got?

Speaker 6:          02:56:26       I would like to, I would like to say as an open minded mail, I enjoy the discussion with Sarah and I find it interesting to see a different perspective and that's what this election's about. Cause guess what? We're all going to internment camps when he fucking finds out who we voted for.

Speaker 15:         02:56:41       Trump's bring him back in turn. Mccafe motherfuckers. Yeah, it's great. We live in a democracy. Some people want condoms in porn and some people want this. We're two grown men. Can we vote for whatever just happened to be illegal.

Speaker 18:         02:57:06       That just took the sting off of whoever wins.

Speaker 12:         02:57:09       Yes.

Speaker 10:         03:10:56       You're just trying to figure out a way to get her from the Lexus

Speaker 17:         03:10:58       piece of shit froze again till early to call. Hey, fuck that. How about this whole God damn time. Come on. You guys been hanging in there, hanging in there. Oh, they're dying. Gaul. I purposely told Chad Shank, listen, fuck the audience. We're going to do. This. Rogan was legitimately concerned. Well, we're going to overtalk. Everyone's going to go for the punchline if we do a live thing, but no. Yeah, he basically said exactly what was going to happen was going to happen. Oh

Speaker 19:         03:11:35       wait, wait, wait. Did you guys think this was going to happen? Do you guys think this was going to be the result or did you think you'd be like kind of half celebrated, half going, okay, it'll be fine, but we can make fun of what's going on. But now it's a fucking, yeah,

Speaker 10:         03:11:46       no, no. The what part of the reason Doug wanted to cancel it because he figured Hilary was gonna win. And he was like, yeah, fuck it. No, that was the excuse I gave Rogan when I was begging him to make me get, please don't make me do this.

Speaker 17:         03:12:00       And then my life got worse. Oh, I gotta be honest with you. I thought if we were starting at seven, I thought it was going to be over. I just thought everyone was going to vote for Hillary because she was more than made guy. He was a reality show star. And then I was like halfway through I was like, Oh shit, this is going to be a good podcast. It's still going. And then somewhere halfway through that I was like, oh my God, this guy might be president. This is fucking terrifying. You and I know you knew it was hilarious. Still about 6:59 PM and ever since then I'm like, wait a minute, this is, this is fucking crazy. Hey, it's Sophie the waitress around here. Cause she come to the stage, the stage, well actually let's stop the podcast or no, no, I'm going to tell Sophie comes to the stage. This seems very importantly, oh no, it's Sophie related. I think under Trump

Speaker 19:         03:12:52       you can just guess any woman to get you a drink and they have,

Speaker 6:          03:12:57       that's the new rule. I don't get these guys offended by the grabbing and the post. These stuff. What are they picking up? Bowling balls with two hands. Fucking business. You do jokes and just jabber,

Speaker 19:         03:13:09       but did you get it? It's not, it's not an, I don't, I feel like, I feel like, oh hi. Can you just talk? I heard though that a lot of the Poles, like we all thought that it wasn't those on that other phone.

Speaker 6:          03:13:25       Phone is Morgan. What were you gonna say?

Speaker 19:         03:13:26       No, I think it's, it's, I feel like there was a, a, a national besides Judaism and sexism that exists and I'm very upset about it. Hang on, let me put bill burrs, golf ball on his feet. Please. Ready? I'm ready to fucking talk to two felonies she got accused of that somehow disappeared. But if I had one of those, I'd be hanging out with snowed in Russia.

Speaker 4:          03:14:01       Morgan,

Speaker 19:         03:14:02       you know, I have to be honest with you that the Democrats did pick the wrong person because they've done so much shit. They really are. The Democrats Bushes. They've done so much fucking shit. They had a lot of fucking emoney. Anime say, Hey, not you're saying the Republicans pick the right person, which is one of the most, that's not what I'm saying. You're putting those words in my mouth. Well then stop doing that. Hey listen, you guys get heated. If at any point it gets a little too touchy for the people. I'll go with licking his tit. Yeah, and we'll just get her damage. Laughs. I can't have an argument because I'm not that smart. I'm just sad

Speaker 6:          03:14:40       you're saying what? Go ahead. No, make a salient point. If it gets uncomfortable. It's right here. I think he's been Borgen. I think

Speaker 19:         03:14:49       make a good point and they're going to watch this again. Here it comes to qualified person and you go, okay, why didn't she make it go? There's clearly people in this country who are raises, who are misogynistic or homophobic, who are Zena phobic? How can you just blow off all of those? Like like how many felonies do you have to be accused of things as well? I'm not saying he's a good guy. Well, I'm just saying that you can't literally just say the reason why you're not voting for Clinton is because you're a misogynist is actually sexist shit. She's almost people who voted for him.

Speaker 4:          03:15:22       It is. It's like you're saying. Yeah, it's okay.

Speaker 19:         03:15:25       No, I don't believe that all the people voted for Trump are smart enough to assess every wrong doing that. They think Clinton that I did. I think that they, I think that's cause you live out here. Sure. I live in a bubble because you live out here and you think everybody who doesn't live near an ocean is a dope bill bill. Oh Shit. Yeah. Walsh

Speaker 6:          03:15:42       is drawn away. By the way. Would it be to be in the middle of a breakup and have bill burr walk in the door and go, I'll take it from,

Speaker 17:         03:15:53       no, I'm just saying that people out here have a fucking Tennessee to call 90% of the state's flyover states and think that there were a bunch of fucking morons and then have the nerve to fucking trash Fox News where you guys are the exact same fucking people all the way to the left and it's annoying. Absolutely is annoying. It's annoying. He's got you there. It's a total fucking understand the reason behind him. But you're literally saying that the reason why she's not winning, he says, because people are sexist and you're ignoring all of this other shit and they're racist and there beside you this take and they're homophobic and they're 100% that's it. I think that said, Lily. Say you're telling me, you're telling me the full Obama ran against Trump. This would even been a fucking race. No. Well, I write faster than the Obama was squeaky fucking clean. Moderator has a question for Bill Berg.

Speaker 17:         03:16:52       Morgan, what about all the stuff that Bill Clinton was accused of that you know all the Lolita Express, all the women that came out are Hillary basically fucking shaming them. Like why is that not an issue to that? The person who was like, everything that's a Trump is accused of, no one cares cares. Bill Clinton paid one question and you know, official office, it's the same thing. I don't want to say why we compartmentalize it. W W gymnasts. I respect you. I just walked from his actual words. I'll just give you just one question. Okay. This city rapists. I can't vote for somebody who's calling like an entire gender pigs. I'm not going to do it. Why are you voting for someone? Why do you need a leader? All right. Just one question and I'm asking bill because I want your opinion bill. What? I hate both of the massage and the racist fucking hate both of them tired.

Speaker 19:         03:22:39       Yeah. Every feed is different. That's what's so confusing. It's like MSNBC. Everybody has different numbers.

Speaker 19:         03:23:02       No, CNN and there where they were like a predicting what was gonna happen. They set up New Hampshire gets this and have to cause this that Trump could win and there was clearly a panel of people and they were miked and you just heard somebody go, Jeez, like you don't know who it was, but somebody reacted harshly.

The red wire or the black wire. This is the moment and a Tom cruise movie. We all salute to the scientologist, you know, by the way, how the fuck do you commit to a religion that was created by an old red head with crooked teeth in a broken down bone? You know, your teeth are fine. Um, parents used to live in Pennsylvania, but the idea of Pennsylvania decided in the fucking fate of the country highlights how crazy this fucking thing in Florida with Amish people, sixers the super Steelers Phillies, penguins burgs awesome. But they're surrounded by a bunch of people that are just fucking hanging out. I love Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Fucking college right in the middle of the state.

Speaker 11:         03:28:07       Whoa. However, Trump owns the New York Times. Hey, Rogen, have you heard of that? Trump talks about getting rid of the Federal Reserve. What do you think about that?

Speaker 11:         03:28:27       would, if he tries to do that, they're going to bring out that fucking 63 convertible fucking the Lincoln continental down through Dallas. Drive him around town. Yeah. Hey, here's a bookstore. Yeah, nice slow fucking left heart. Have you ever taken that drive? You haven't gone through that area. I've gone to it, which is what amazes me about Dallas where if you guys had never been to Dallas with John F. Kennedy got assassinated. They didn't mess with any of that. It looks exactly like it did when it happened and out here how they just don't give a fuck. Like Rob Robert Kennedy got killed right down there and we'll show at the ambassador hotel. They just plowed that shit over, turned it into a fucking school. There's a little plaque on the ground. Yay. Died somewhere over here. There's a little swing set. They just don't give a shit out here. That's a rose family. Well, Huh? Yeah. Earl's Tom Cole. My Ann was Ethel Kennedy. I don't like this topic right now. Trump is to 64 nice headshots though. Trump has two 64 before to two 15 trucks got Pennsylvania. Oh,

Speaker 10:         03:30:02       This is good. This is good. Like a crazy girlfriend. It gives great blow jobs, but eventually she leaves you. This is good. You feel terrible, but there's a growth period that comes after that, but you reassess your whole existence and try to figure out why the fuck are you here? Why is the man with a cotton candy here have his hand on the red phone? What is happening? What have we done? What mistakes? If we may, let's we examine our existence. This, this is what this opportunity provides us. Lazy Gentleman. He provides us a moment of harkening. I'm often of listening and thinking and centering hadn't money doesn't mean anything anymore because a man with the orange skin, sorry, I'm fucking nuclear war. Fuck yeah.

The greatest show on turf questionably. Yours is good. Is this good? Um, I don't think so. If he didn't so relate. Honestly, to be honest with you, he didn't sell, relate to so many like overtly racist people, to be honest with you. And like that level of ugliness. If he didn't relate to Alaska, he got Alaska. Uh, they give him three to 47 to 58 he needs to 70 with the APP. I totally blows me away. She's a 55 away. Oh my God. You mean to tell me the deadliest voted for Hilary? Believable? Unfathomable.

Speaker 10:         03:32:31       He's 48% of her, 46% of the Michigan. It's over bitches.

Speaker 11:         03:32:36       Robbie, Robbie, concen happy last year everybody by 3.1

Speaker 10:         03:33:02       Well, I figured out how to have the phone put the Bingos head while she's in a coma, so she's been listening for the last thing. Hold on a second. Hey, you guys got to, you got to stop that song. Whoever's think Megan, that song played because that'll get us pulled up a youtube. Oh, don't do that anymore, dude. Come on.

Speaker 11:         03:33:33       Bingo has been listening for 34 minutes in a coma. There's

Speaker 10:         03:33:38       a phone against her hand, but if bill burr is right that Trump is president and I'm just going to say Bingo, go towards the light.

Speaker 7:          03:33:56       It's so interesting. It really is. It's really interesting. I mean, what the fuck have we gotten ourselves into ma'am? You with the fake cat ears whenever you got going on, ma'am. Question. Okay. Can you take it from me? We'd hear you better,

Speaker 10:         03:34:16       Bert. Kreischer too. It's very loud.

Speaker 18:         03:34:29       I like it. When you said, uh, when people are elected and maybe this maybe talk to fucking behave, how do you feel that that truck

Speaker 10:         03:34:42       go back to the Mad Max? All of a sudden I'm Jenny.

Speaker 7:          03:34:51       I'm answering questions from the crowd. I don't know. You know, we, we never know. It's never happened before and it's like that's, that's our big romance. It's like, like in a pretty woman, the hooker with a heart of gold, hope, hope. Some rich businessman comes and rescues or we hope that some person pretends to be someone other than what they really are. Then it gets into office. Then once they get in there, they show us. They really have purely altruistic intentions and they want to take care of us, but we've never found anybody like that. You know? They get inside. They just want to get their dick sucked. Paula,

Speaker 12:         03:35:28       where's that happened?

Speaker 10:         03:35:29       Did you do to take care of your wait staff thing yet? No, we should do birthdays. We have 15 more minutes, man. I think. What are we selling? Merch? Why did we think this wasn't going to, oh my God. The Republicans have won the Senate to 48 to 46 in the Senate. Holy Shit. This is crazy. We're fucking 50 we're almost never, who gives a shit why we thought this was going to be 350 people here that paid money. I know, but fuck it. Hopefully we can burn. It was going to be closing. That's fascinating. Like, Hey guys, let's Sarah get her opinions enrolled. They count what's Trump becomes president. We're going to zip that shot. Oh my God, Sarah. Easily a six and a half. I'll take it. I'll give her a six. You don't want him, you get caught up living out here. You think of you, the whole country thinks the way you think out here, ladies and gentlemen. So lopsided.

Speaker 18:         03:36:36       And then I heard today that a lot of people like it when people were pulling, like a lot of people said, oh, I'm not voting for Trump. And then they did because they were apparently too embarrassed to say that they were so liberal lie. Right. Well I don't know. That's what I'm saying. Like I know to say you go on social media, it's all a fucking oversharing. People won't shut the voices. Most important podcast of your life asking, I'm on more opinion who are in this business, live in New York or la and that's what they were around. And I think that that's America and it isn't. They need to go on the road and start telling jokes and I'll meet other people. But don't do that. I'm like, I'm not direct polls were in Ohio and Florida and Miss Sarah, if I held you ever walk by anybody taken a poll and they go, Hey, can I stop you for a second? It's like, no, I got shit to dope. Go Fuck Yourself. They talk to, I get those phone calls. I get the phone calls. I don't answer it but do not call

Speaker 6:          03:37:35       occasionally. Let's let Burt tart. If you did a poll in this room and you're like, and they're walking on the street, you're like, hey, have you ever said the n word? Everyone be like, no, never, but that's not fucking true. There's people out there that uh, will be voting for Trump because they feel disenfranchised by the system, but don't want to share it and get into an argument with some fucking random liberal in the by the water cooler.

Speaker 15:         03:38:00       That was Doug. I agree with you

Speaker 6:          03:38:11       listening folks. This is, this is is fucked up for us as it is for you. How dare you say that word or

Speaker 15:         03:38:20       legally you can stay it now as of midnight. What time is

Speaker 6:          03:38:25       one? Is My phone is, my point is it's the, there are disenfranchised people. Why they called it? What? Another person, Trump is the president.

Speaker 15:         03:38:39       Adrian Peterson have a black guy call a collection election.

Speaker 6:          03:38:47       Trump is the president comes the president as we know it.

Speaker 18:         03:38:53       Yay.

Speaker 6:          03:38:55       They're legit. Called it. I don't know. They did not call it yellow bird. Naughty crasher. You have no shirt on. You motherfucker. How dare you. Maybe I shouldn't be arguing politics. He's six away. What? What is undecided? What is undecided? Or are they telling you that on Grindr, but he'll never win any of those states. Is that Carlito Alaska, Alaska, Arizona and Michigan are done. It's tough.

Speaker 12:         03:39:35       Well, I mean in front of 400 people, truthfully, but I heard, I appreciate it.

Speaker 10:         03:39:39       Shibley had a great line. We missed it. Where are you talking about Bingo right now will,

Speaker 12:         03:39:52       ah,

Speaker 10:         03:40:37       That girl from Tinder here. Yeah. There's just like, does anybody feel bad if Trump wins are good? If Hillary wins are good, if Trump wins are good, if I don't know, we need to see what the fuck is going to do first. It aids kind of like the WME buying the UFC. We don't know what the fuck is going to happen. You have no idea how exactly right you are. Doesn't matter if you don't watch the sport.

We weren't really upset about the Czech Republic. Peters, you mother fucker. Doug Stanhope going on tilt. It's okay folks.

Speaker 11:         03:42:03       I watched a youtube video today where these two guys got into a fight and they went to the ground, little ground and pound, and it turned out halfway through. One of the dudes had a fake leg and it came off and the other dude was losing and then the fucking dude picked up the fake leg and he started beating the guy with it. Like I can zone ass. It was fucking a, yeah, it was all like, I was thinking like if I was that Kid's dad, I would have been like, dude, you lost the fight. Give him his prosthetic back and just, you know, go to the gym.

Speaker 10:         03:42:34       I disagree. As an analyst, I say, you got to use what's in front of you. If it's okay, if that guy's beating your ass and he's got a fake leg, kicked that motherfucker to the side and go, what's up now hop along. But he didn't. He didn't, he didn't initiate it. It doesn't matter. He was in his house. The dude was calling them. I'll know what kind of relationship the guy reminded. I call the passive aggressive

Speaker 11:         03:42:56       piece of shit for years. Well, I would just say that I saw the video and I'm just judging from what the fuck I saw it. Come on, man. You gotta you gotta draw the line of beating somebody with their own fake.

Speaker 10:         03:43:05       Unless that guy's a piece of shit. Eat Shit. It just lost his leg last week and he's still a client who started it. The trauma,

Speaker 11:         03:43:12       it looked like the other kid was the aggressor. I try. I'm not the one with the bad leg. Look, I'm just saying the guy's fucking leg fell off and he beat him with it.

Speaker 10:         03:43:20       Click off the election. Let's pull up that video. Then the guy that won his three legs Shucker I'll take that video and I'll see you and I'll fucking push up. One duty got fucked to death by horse. I've never seen drunk opie and Anthony show come to him and they told you to take it down. X percent of my shows. Rogan made me watch that after the fake moon landing thing.
