Speaker 1:          00:00          Her low freak bitches. So ridiculous. But um, women's Bantam weight division is filled with fucking killers now. There's so many good fighters. They're trading titles now. The main events I love, that's a big, big deal. Women's sports, you know, they don't what's definitely a big deal for the biggest paper. Have you ever, I mean obviously it wasn't going to be of John Jones didn't test positive for something, but uh, because he did, it's switched around. Yeah. So to it yet. Is he saying what he did? No, he's not, he's not saying anything. Chill son and leaked the information during my last podcast so it's out of his chest. Shale has leaked out information. It could be, is it what he said to me out there? I had no nothing. I didn't hear anything. Had nothing at all talking about, honestly, I'm in a weird position cause I don't think you're supposed to, I don't think he supposed to.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Anybody's supposed to be talking about the medical results until like it gets released. I don't know how it works. I really don't. I'm going to plead in grunts, plead ignorance all day bridal name. I think he probably took boner pills cause that's, they have all that shit in them. You know, like they have boner pills, have steroids in them that they have. And I always hitting right now because I just found at Joe's gas station over here, it has like the best, I've never seen these. Ryan is known for his love of the boner pill. He means what you would call a boner pill. Con is tour. He's actually a read blogs about boner pills and directed me to reviews of boner pills. Terrified. But they, I mean these things have steroids in them. They have a bunch of stuff and if you party wasn't the last thing he got busted for cocaine or something. If you bust, if you do cocaine, I had a guys take these because you can get hard off of having cocaine. And so if he takes boner pills, then he's going to attend a little too much speculation for a person like believe respect.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Okay.
