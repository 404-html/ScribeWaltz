Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ready? Five, four, three, two, one. Mr. Shock, first of all, thank you very, very, very much for being here. I've been following your work for a long time now and uh, I'm, I'm very appreciative of you and very appreciative of everything you've done and I've been fascinated by the subject of ancient Egypt. So, um, I really, I'm really excited. Very siloed. Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. I've heard a lot about your show. I've heard a lot about you. My, of course you'd like John Anthony West I think was on with you a couple of times. Maybe. He was very proud that I guess you did the only full skype interview with him. Yeah, that's the only one I've ever done is with him. Yeah. He used to like to talk about that so. Well I just had to talk to him and he was in upstate New York at the time and it was just, he really didn't have any plans to come down here and I'm just, I was very fortunate to one day get them in studio though.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       It was really nice. So it's been wonderful. Well, his work, that DVD series, he did magical Egypt was amazing and I had seen your work before that in that mysteries of the Sphinx thing that was narrated by Charlton Heston, Heston, NBC, 1993, I think in many ways it was the mystery of the Sphinx that really broke everything open. It brought everything to the public attention. I've had many people tell me, I'm not trying to brag or anything, I'm just saying it's actually that this really opened up a new field, if we could put it that way, a new way of looking at things in the popular, among the popular, um, public popular media that people around the world versus the academic scholarly journals and the back and forth, that type of thing. You have to remember, I'm a faculty member. I'm at Boston University. I'm an academic, uh, and many of the academics have poo pooed should we say over the years, bringing things to the public.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       But I think it's been important to do now what we're talking about, for the people that are uninformed is the idea that some of the structures in ancient Egypt are far older than conventional wisdom or conventional modern day archeology, modern day egyptologist. They would like us to believe that all of this spawned from a very specific time period and people like John Anthony West and yourself and some other folks like Graham Hancock are proposing that it's entirely possible that there were many different areas of construction in Egypt and that there are some structures that are far far older than we think. Yeah, exactly. And this what I was alluding to is just really opened up with our work on reading the Great Sphinx and I think you know the story, but maybe just to summarize in the smallest of nutshells, John Anthony West, before I met him, he was became a followership. We say I shouldn't say follower because that sounds wrong. That sounds like it's a religion

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       dogma, but he became interested in the work of the late Schwaller de Lubitsch who died passed away in 1961, but he had mentioned in one line that the Sphinx had been weathered by rain, I would say precipitation as a geologist, not wind and sand, so this if it were true, and it is true, would put the Sphinx back to a much earlier period which would tie in with Schwab Adler's work and John Anthony West sis subsequent work that there were indications that dynastic Egypt as we know it, going back to about 3000 BC, was really a legacy of what I call now an earlier cycle of civilization or something that goes back much, much earlier, which at this point I date back to the end of the last ice age. Ice Age ended 9,700 BC. Just to put it in perspective for people. So when, when did you first get on board with this? John Anthony West come to you or John?

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       Anthony West. Okay. So the story goes this way. John Anthony West published serpent in the sky. His probably most famous book, First Edition Nineteen 79, he was then looking for someone that could really validate or at least assess from a scientific point of view, this theory about this face, which he had just barely sort of touched the surface based on Schwaller. That may be. It could be older, but this was really a geological question. He mentioned that in 1979 in serpent in the sky, John Anthony West went on to become very involved with Egypt and he started traveling to Egypt. He led tourists to Egypt. He wrote the travelers key to ancient Egypt in 1985. Also mentions in appendix. I think it was just the older sphinx theory, but really looking for someone to at least assess it scientifically. He met a fellow at in in Egypt actually at the time, Robert Eddie, who is a phd in English literature, I believe, something like that, but he was teaching in Cairo and American University in Cairo, I believe.

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       Then he came to Boston University. This is late 19 eighties. I was and still do teach at Boston University full time. Robert Eddy and myself got to know each other. Robert Eddie mentioned me as a geologist to John Anthony West and that may be. This was someone who seemed fairly knowledgeable, fairly open minded about things, the time. Did you have any live on Egypt or. Oh, I. I. my interest in Egypt goes way back. I was reading about ancient Egypt when I was literally six, seven, eight years old. I had a grandmother who had a wonderful library at the time and I would go through her library. She had books from British Museum on

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       Ancient Egypt going back to the turn of the century, so I. I was prepared in the sense that I was open to such things, but I didn't imagine getting involved in Egypt in any way professionally.

Speaker 4:          00:06:09       Did you have any thoughts about the dating of the Sphinx and the pyramids or anything back then before you looked into?

Speaker 3:          00:06:15       There were two things, so there were two things going on in my head back then, which may be prepped me for this number one, I knew the conventional story. I knew that the Sphinx goes back to 2,500 BC according to the standard Egyptologists in 1989, which is when I first, I believe it was 1989, I first actually met western person. I had in my mind that the egyptologists must be correct because they've studied it. They must know what they're doing. I was coming from an academic point of view. I, I'm, I'm not, I'm just giving, you know, saying where I'm coming from. I had gone to Yale University and get my phd in Geology and geophysics. I was very well grounded in the status quo academic point of view. So I thought when I first went to Egypt I would just prove west wrong. I would just prove that the egyptologist knew what they were talking about, but, and this is an important, but I was also trained in many ways, both as a graduate student and going back to my grandmother who I had great respect for and was also very, should we say liberal and open minded but critical.

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       You always have to follow the evidence wherever it goes. And that's always been my rule of thumb, that not everything is always the way people say it is even if their authorities and something I already knew when I went to Egypt for the first time was that some of the very old egyptologists in the late 19th, early 20th century had actually suggested that just the way it looks, the feel of the Sphinx, not based on hard evidence really that may be, it was older than the pyramids. That may be. It goes back earlier. So I felt that it wasn't all said and done and you know, pat and sound that the egyptologist necessarily knew what they were talking about in modern times because some of the earlier egyptologist who they held in very high respect supposedly had set different things. Secondly, and I hate to bring this up, but I will because it's part of the background.

Speaker 3:          00:08:20       I, my grandmother, who I mentioned a second ago, uh, was uh, theosophy and Thea, if you know anything about theosophy, it also suggests that, you know, maybe there's things that go back earlier. I don't theosophy theosophy it's, it's a, how do I explain it? You have you heard of Blavatsky Madame Blavatsky? No. Okay. Well, I'm losing my headphones. Theosophy was founded in the late 19th century. It questioned a lot of the values, a lot of the dogma of Science, of the time, of religion, of the time it looked to the east in particular to other philosophies, other world views. So basically it was a way. This is what it did for me at least. And I'm not a theosophist I don't want to say I'm a theosophy, uh, but reading theosophical works on top of everything else allowed me, I think to expand my horizons and to see that maybe this dogma of the day is just that the dogma of the day, that there are other possibilities and not that we accept something just because someone said it or it because it's old or because it's this religion or that religion or that supposed to be ancient culture.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       But no, you keep everything open. You look at the evidence and that's really where I was coming from. But my point is that even in late 19 eighties, early 19 nineties, when I first got involved with this, if I looked at it critically, the evidence was not that definitive for the age of the Sphinx. So I was going in with openminded possibilities. But honestly, when I first went to Egypt with John Anthony West in 1990, I thought before I got off the plane that this would be simple, open and shut case. I would prove him wrong in the sense of his assertions. That may be the Sphinx was older. I had no doubt at the time that my colleagues in Egyptology must know what they're talking about and all of that change literally within 30, without exaggerating, 30 to 120 seconds of first seen recently. Reasonings. Yeah, it really did.

Speaker 3:          00:10:39       What was your first impression? Because my first impression of the spanx was now that I saw on the ground in person, there was something wrong with the Egypt and logical dating. Because when you look at the Sphinx as a geologist with a geological I, this was not weathered by wind and sand. This was not desert erosion. And weathering that I saw on the sinks, the body of the Sphinx, which is very difficult to tell because it's been heavily repaired and reworked, but particularly on the walls of what are known as the Sphinx enclosure. The Sphinx enclosure is important because it preserves a lot of the details and if you haven't, if the audience has not been to Egypt, they should realize that when they carved the Sphinx, it's all solid bedrock. Only. The head initially was above the ground surface. You carved, they carved down into the rock to free up the body, what I call it, the core body of the Sphinx in that core body and the walls of the enclosure, more or less the quarry around it, if you want to use that term that showed these ancient weathering precipitation erosion or features that are incompatible with the last 5,000 years of climatic history on the eastern edge of the Sahara.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       So immediately I knew there was something wrong geologically had to figure that out. Either this was a weird geological anomaly or something else was going on and the Sphinx might go back to an earlier period. Also, I want to point out that when you look at the Sphinx and other geologists have looked at this as well, they did not just chip away at the rock to carve the body more or less. You could have chipped away at the rock with pick axes and that type of thing. Shoveled out chips of rock in baskets. That would've been the easy way. What they did is they carved out huge blocks of stone. I mean when I say huge, we're talking multitenant, tens of tons. Some of them maybe over 50 tons or more of limestone. They moved those due east of the Sphinx and built what is now known as the Sphinx Temple, which is still there in ruinous condition and the valley temple.

Speaker 3:          00:12:59       So you had these two huge temples and what is interesting and lot of people don't realize this or they don't think about. I think those constructions which are contemporary with the oldest portion of the Sphinx in some ways, are more impressive if you think about the technology and what went into constructing them than the age of the Sphinx itself. So it's not just the Sphinx. It's also these limestone temples that are associated with it and we're built contemporaneously, so jamie pulled up to photos here. The first one that he pulled up was a computer image that showed the Sphinx and showed how I'm looking at it. Yeah. Yes. And in this image, what you can see that's a computer image that's actually from mystery of the Sphinx, and then there's a inset that's an aerial photograph, the real thing, and that shows how when they were carving the body, they cut out huge blocks and then put them in position to make what's known as the swings temple due east of the swing.

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       And the second image is the Sphinx Temple. You look at this, it says this, things faces due east, the rising sun and right in front of it is the Sphinx Temple. So this is a humongous temple made out of these huge blocks of stone which were carved out when they carve the body of the Sphinx. And here you see in this image another, a picture of the Sphinx Temple. And so these erosion, if you can see how big they are, you can see how big they are. They're enormous. Okay. These erosion features on the blocks, don't worry about them for the moment. Okay. Let's go back to the Sphinx enclosure itself. It's a sphinx enclosure where you see the rolling, undulating, profiled, the Roche no features here. You see it in that picture. The vertical fissures, and I know you're familiar with this personally because I've heard you talk about it, finance they west, that can only be caused by precipitation.

Speaker 3:          00:14:55       The rocks are like a layer cake, so it takes out the software layers, it receipts the software layer, some of the harder layer stick out further, but the water also finds its way down crevices and cracks, natural features that are slightly softer and it forms these vertical fissures. I want to make the point because a lot of people get confused. They say, couldn't it be rising Nile floods? No. Geologically, that will give a very different signature on the rockets, not floods coming up from the bottom. It's actually precipitation and rainfall runoff coming from above and rainfall for thousands of years. Well, there's two aspects here. It could be thousands of years, it could be much stronger rainfall, you know, huge flash floods, that type of thing. And part of the story that I hope we'll get to is that initially I'm jumping around here a little bit, but initially I was thinking five to 7,000 bc that was very conservative based on the geological data, based on the seismic, which we have to get to also.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       But now I believe we're talking prior to 9,700 BC for the original construction of the Sphinx and we can talk about why the data and at 9,700 bc we have the end of the younger Dryas, the end of the glacial epic, the end of the last ice age. I have now put together the story based on evidence and when I ever I say if I say I believe something or I think something is always based on evidence. I've been piecing together that what we had ending the younger dryas ending the last ice age was a huge eruption from the sun. A huge solar outbursts, huge climatic changes which put among other things a lot of precipitation, allow moisture into the air which came down as precipitation with huge floods, huge centrally, thunderstorms, etc. And I think a lot of the initial errosion that we still see on the walls of the sinks enclosure go back to that period.

Speaker 3:          00:17:08       So you hAd the situation where you would get thIs incredible weathering and erosion and then it continued for thousands of years after that and was reinforced until you had the sahara coming in in relatively recent times and geologically in times desert that sahara desert. So before that it was some sort of a rain forest, a. It's a vanity rainforest. It actually varied over time. And before that it was very fertile. Savannah, lots of plants there. People have seen it even in popular movies and whatnot, how the sahara at one point had water and all kinds of animals. That's before end of the last ice age before this. These incredible changes that we have at 9,700 bc. So that's where the sphinx, I think the original sphinx goes back to that time period and that's what the egyptians called zep tepi. This was a first time for them or what I call an earlier cycle of civilization.

Speaker 3:          00:18:11       The last cycle, the one that we're still part of in my terminology is the last 5,000 years. So civilization arising reemerging, I should say about 3000 to 4,000 bc company into really what we have now is high technology, etc. But before that there had been an earlier cycle civilization that was essentially snuffed out or brought to its knees if you would, by the end of the last ice age. And just to map this out, a period from about 9,700 bc, this is what I'm reconstructing now to about 4,000 to 3000 bc where we have civilization reemerging between that period. So thousands of years. Ninety 700 bc to say 3,700 bc for round numbers, 6,000 years. We have essentially a dark period. And what I've been now calling siddha solar induced dark age, sort of ironic. the sun will induce a dark age because of brought civilization back to an earlier stage, if you would.

Speaker 3:          00:19:18       I'm not sure I follow that. Well, how did the son do this? Um, solar outburst essentially coronal mass ejection, huge eruption, bigger than anything we've ever seen laws, these massive thunder showers and we exactly in modern history, modern history is even close to this, but we do have isotope data, etc. That indicates this has happened in the past at the end of the last ice age and I'm sure it's happened many times over and you have a lot of markers that indicate this. You have vitrification of rock. I'm in fact a lot of the markers, and I don't want to be debating the issue necessarily, but a lot of the markers that people have used for a comment at the younger dryas or during the younger dryas through, most of them are at the beginning of the younger dryas. That'S what they're claiming, but loved that a lot of the dating is very, very iffy.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       Um, I found it interesting. For instance, someone will use something as a marker for the younger dry ice. And that will give a date of 12,000 plus or minus 4,000 years. So, you know, this is just the way geology is, but I remember, I can't remember his name. You had a guest on one of your shows. he was when? randall carlson, not randall carlson. I know randall very well. Uh, he was on with carlson and shermer and a half, but he came on by a skype. You outcome malcolm. I do not remember it. But anyway, he was one of the people that was quote, comment proponent. And he started pointed out a lot of the evidence, a micro spirituals, glassy spheres on nano diamonds. I don't think he mentioned biomed, say shocked quartz, et cetera. And everyone has been assuming this has to be from a physical impact in the sense of something coming down like a comet or asteroid, that type of thing.

Speaker 3:          00:21:17       but the problem is you don't necessarily find craters. You don't necessarily find the pieces of the comment. You should find some physical remains. And he mentioned, and I found it very interesting, he mentioned in passing what I've been working on now for a number of years that no, and I was once on the comment band bike and I'll put it that way and I'm not trying knock good research, but when you look at the evidence, what is not being considered by a lot of people, and he mentioned this in passing and said, well, you know, something else that could cause this lightning but you wouldn't have lightning. You know, that's very localized. We think of this very localized. Um, but if you have a major solar outburst, mainers are coronal mass ejections and astrophysicists who is now deceased. He was at cornell, thomas gold, who did a lot of really good, in fact, prize winning work in astrophysics, first pointed out in the 19 sixties that if you have a major solar outburst, major coronal mass ejection, you would get essentially huge.

Speaker 3:          00:22:23       What would be like huge lightning strikes over incredible areas of the earth. Simultaneously. This would cost vitrification. It would cause all these features. And just as a, within the last year, there's been more work done showing that full rights were lightning strikes in modern times. Even small lightning strikes like that can cause, can create things like shocked quartz. Other quote impact features that people have always said, well, it must be a comet or asteroid, but you're not finding the craters, you not finding other things. So what I'm finding are my own research, um, is I'm coming to conclude that it wasn't a physical object that hit us. It was a solar outburst. That's a general term I use possible that it was both. Um, actually there's, it's quite possible that it could have been both. Yeah, there could have been fragments of both. I can address that.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       Um, and there's a couple of aspects to both. When you say both, there is indications that comments diving into the sun actually caused coronal mass ejections a correlated with disturbing the sun. So in some cases you'll have the occult, the comic group talking about how we go through these comment streams periodically. I agree 100 percent. In fact, I talk about this in some of my early books because I really was into comments at the time, four inches of the pyramid builders. For instance, I talk about how comments might have begun and ended the younger dryas, but I wasn't thinking about solar activity at that time. Seriously asked, no one else was. But we now find that commentS dive into the sun when we go through comment streams that can set off solar activity. So in fact, I think it could be both, but it could be that the comments are affecting the sun, which is then affecting the earth rather than directly, if that makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:24:22       Um, and the other thing is that people have to understand there's a couple of things going on. The younger dryas, 10,900 bc when it first begins is a cooling period. It's not as dramatic climate change as you have at 9,700 bc when all of a sudden we go from deep ice age climatic regime to modern are even a little bit warmer initially. Modern changes. And this is it. Oh, there. Yeah, there we have some isotope data. And what we have at 9,700 bc, and this is based on sediment cores in ice cores, we also have lunar data that supports is at 9,700 bc. We have incredible climatic change going from, you know, deep ice age to modern warming. And this literally now based on what they call micro stratigraphy from greenland, ice cores can be dated within. Get this weeks, two days. Wow. So thiS happened literally we're talking virtually overnight.

Speaker 3:          00:25:24       When I was a graduate student, we thought things had happened. Suddenly we were talking thousands of years or decades. Oh god, don't take decadeS for something to happen geologically. That'd be crazy. Right now we're talking literally weeks today. So that's incredible. Yeah. So I think this ties in to support that. There was a massive solar event in [inaudible] 9,700 bc. Uh, what we had a, just a slide a minute ago when I saw it out, the side of my eye was a graph of based on isotope data is what they call proxies of solar activity. Again, based on primarily ice core sediment cores. And the sun was incredibly active and 9,700 bc and shortly after there, and it had huge, if you think of anthropomorphically mood swings, will be very active. Then would go very skilled and very active again, very still. And this happened for some thousands of years and then it evened out.

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       The sun cert became quiescent. It was during this quiescence period that tying back into human civilization, civilization was able to reemerge, redevelop again, and we've had incredibly good conditions should we say, for the last 5,000 quite condition, stable conditions on earth for civilization to reemerge. Tying back into that theme, but recently the son has become very active again and we have to be very careful. I'm not a doomsayer scaremonger. I'm not trying to sell people on being preppers, but the reality is the sun is starting to become active again, just as it was at the end of the last ice age. And I think this makes perfect sense because the sun is a star. It goes through cycles like other stars do, and we're a little planet or retain it. And we're like all the other plants affected by this fascinating. Now that we have this incredible need to keep things exactly the way they are, to the point where we were in denial about any potential change.

Speaker 3:          00:27:30       If you're studying things that was like, oh, it'll be fine. We're, we're so inclined. We are so inclined to do that. It's very interested helion. And in fact, um, I forget who it was. One of the astrophysicist some decades ago said about the sun. It was sort of the last vestige of eris julianism in modern science. Everyone assumed the son is stable, essentially. Perfect. Yes, it goes through little sun cycles of 11 and 22 years and maybe some bigger ones have a few centuries, but no one wanted to think of it as what it is. Just a plain old star that goes through periods of the equilibrium. We've been in relative solar equilibrium for thousands of years now, but it goes through disequilibrium and has, we'll call hiccups in spurts and has to recalibrate itself if you would, uh, and we feel the effects on earth. And so at the end of the last ice age, we had this massive solar event, solar outburst, what they call 'em, a solar proton events, um, it would have messed up the ionosphere caused all kinds of geomagnetic storms.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       This tyson with earthquake activity that we see at the end of the last ice age because we now have lots of evidence that solar activity upset, said mac nita sphere and the magnate magnetic fields on the earth, the electrical currents in the earth. It's A will trigger earthquakes that are about to happen anyway. Not unlike. I was talking to katy, my wife on the right here. And a good analogy is when you have an avalanche just about ready to go, you can clap your hands in some cases and it sets off this huge avalanche. Yeah. So solar activity is tied in with earth activity, earthquake activity for instance, of volcanic activity. So we see volcanic activity, increased volcanic activity. There was a major, I'm super volcano that went off just at the end of the last ice age. Will why? Probably it. This is me speaking because of the solar activity that set it off, so when you start getting things like platinum iridium osmium spikes, that's not necessarily extra terrestrial.

Speaker 3:          00:29:52       That could be from terreStrial volcanic activity was occurring at that period, so yes, there's extraterrestrial causes, but I think that there's a very strong case to be made that this is solar, that this is the sun influencing us, which is really important to fast forward to today. Here we are, we're on skype. We're using all these electronic media. What could be more vulnerable to a solar outburst? That kind of stuff. Oh, our grid power grids. Power grids will be friday. There was a, and I think we're seeing the beginning of this are we saw the beginning of this because again, I'm a geologist, so I think in broad terms, few hundred years is nothing. Eighteen, 59. Are you aware of the carrington event? No. There was a major solar outburst from a human Perspective, major solar outburst. From an astrophysical perspective, it was nothing but it was a coronal mass ejection.

Speaker 3:          00:30:53       Actually two in a row that hit us in 18, 59. It's known as the carrington event after richard carrington, who, um, first saw the solar flares, a really bright solar flares that were associated with it. It was picked up on the primitive magnetometers of the time that they had, for instance, in london, etc. Study by the physicists of the time and 18, 59, there were electronics around. It was called the telegraph system to telegraph system. Acted as huge antenna that picked up the changing magnetic fields, generated electricity along it, burnt out the telegraph lines, literally set telegraph, um, uh, uh, you know, the places where the telegraph operators worked on fire, telegraph stations on fire, that type of thing. Um, if we had a carrington level event now, which is really quite minor from a astrophysical perspective, orders of magnitude less than what happened at the end of the last ice age, uh, it would fry are grid lines that would knock out all the huge transformers it would be for it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:06       Did that as it's coming in and probably knock out all the sound lights on the gps systems, communications. I mean, it would really bring us to our knees. Is this an article from 18, 59? Yeah. Yeah. The rural display in boston's. Now the display of auroral. Yeah. There you go. Brilliant. At 1:00, ordinary print can be read by the light. Exactly. Because one thing you get is these bright auroras, these bright, what people think of as in northern and southern lights, but in 18, 59, they saw them around the world. I'm back at the end of the last ice age because they were so powerful. What? They become more intense. They take on very discrete structures in the sky. Here's some of what are known as a, again, northern lights, right? Rural displays. But see how it starts to take on a discreet structure on there right there. and to describe it to the audience.

Speaker 3:          00:33:04       Do you see how it sort of looks like a person with their hands up in the air? They start to take on more and more discreet structures. Some of them looked like people with their hands up in there and little legs and some birds phenomenon. This is basically the high charge particles, electrons and protons and whatnot interacting with the atmoSphere. Um, and they form these figures, so it's electrical phenomenon, uh, and it will ultimately come down if you have a tense enough one as you did at the end of last ice age, it will look like if you were there living, you know, 12,000 years ago, 10,000, 11,000, 700 years ago at the end of the last ice age. And you saw this, you would see these things in the sky. Oh, they look like god, say, look like stick figure humans in the sky. Uh, you would see huge lightning bolts hitting parts of the surface of fascinating because that image on that's in hieroglyphics and exactly find this around the world.

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       and anthony parak who's along when we're looking at, but for the people that are. Because a lot of people just listening what we're looking at a discharge formation. Yeah, this is plasma discharge formation. Plasma is essentially think of is electrically charged particles, electrons, protons, that type of thing. As it comes off the sun. And this case, think of a coronal mass ejection, a huge ball of charged gas is one way to describe it, hitting the atmosphere, driving down into the atmosphere, causing these northern lights on steroids. If you wanT to put that image. We're seeing very specific images that looked like stick figures. So these are things you would see in the sky, except they're in many cases they're spinning electrically. You wouldn't notice that they were spinning generally and they looked sort of like. because we've tend to anthropomorphize, we tend to look at like even clouds are rocks formations and we make them look like what we think they look like.

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       They look sort of like stick figure men. Is any of this an actual photograph or these just graphic illustrators? Graphic illustrations. But what we know because we haven't been experienced this fortunately and since photography, but what we do have our petroglyphs dating back to the end of last ice age where people were seeing this in the sky and they were drawing it on the walls of caves, on the walls of rocks. And actually globally. Anthony per rod, who's a los alamos plasma physicist. He is the world's expert on this type of high energy plasma physics. These are some of the. It'll go back. Go back, jamie. I'll look at this from all over the world looking at it exactly. Amazing all over the world. Arizona, Italy, it's all the same thing. It's all the same thing in notice to that. Spain see how they look like stick figures, but they have little weird dots on their sides.

Speaker 3:          00:36:00       Donuts, real humans don't have that, but they're seeing this around the world in this guy and recording it. Also the motif of when these take on search formed, they take on what looked like birds' heads, so the bird headed man. A moTif that you see around the world going back and I believe it all goes back to the end of the last ice age and what people were experiencing, what they were seeing, if you will called gods in the sky or whatever, but they were seeing this and it was having a real effect on their life. What is causing that very specific pattern, that very specific shape that you're seeing? The way, the way I would say, the best way to say it is you've got this, this is simplistic, but you've got these huge electrical charges coming down. they sort of focus like a tornado focuses, or if you think of, um, running water out of a spicket, if you play with it, you can sort of squeeze it and make it form different shapes.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       That served my analogy to it. Um, and it's the magnetic and electric fields interacting with each other. Sometimes they serve spin around each other, like a rope. In that illustration here you see a how to say his name, perrott parent dr plots experiments where he essentially reproduce that, that shape over and over and over again. That's right. Exactly. Reproduce that. And then it gets even more fascinating. And this is something that ties in well actually with katie, my wife catherine ulysse, um, and imparato team has confirmed it on easter island. You have the rango rango script, which also duplicates this and seems to Be a reCord. You know, the modern rango rango are only a few hundred yearS old, but just like any manuscript or anything, it was copied over and over and seems to go back to it too. And if you look at some of the rango rango and I know a lot of your audience can't see this, but you look at some of them, they're even more definitive.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       Look, you know, uh, showing what [inaudible] was able to reproduce experimentally. Um, and they're, they have it recorded from ancient timeS. So when you're talking about this event that happened at the end of the younger dryas, you what? Like put it in perspective, like are we talking about like a hurricane times a thousand? Like what would this be like a million? Yeah, like huge thunderstorm. Yeah. I mean literally possible to comprehend and possible to comprehend from our point of view, my perspective, our perspective. And there's more to it than that. You would have incredible radiation levels at the surface of the earth. Paula violetta physicist I know and he's published on this, has talked about how during an event like this, you would have levels of radiation that were so high that large mammals, we are large mammals, large mammals. If they couldn't protect themselves, they could die within, you know, three to six, seven days a week or so.

Speaker 3:          00:39:01       How do you protect yourself? You go underground, you go Into caves, you go into places because rock will protect you from the surface radiation under the circumstances. Now you don't need to stay there forever. You can, you know, because these solar events probably came. Now this is hypothetical because we've not experienced a huge one like this, but they probably came. Um, and then it went back off a little bit, but then maybe another one would come again, I'm a geologiSt, so think of a huge earthquake and then aftershocks after shocks that can actually last centuries or millennia in some cases, smaller ones. So something that was happening and you see this around the world too, is that we're people survived, I believe in part because they had access to natural caves initially. Then they built underground structures for when they came again and it also encouraged our, uh, developed this whole tradition, shall we say, of having a place to go, even if it's not occurring to the moment they knew that these things do occur, um, at least for some thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          00:40:10       And we're aware of this. So we're getting prepared and now gi would uses during the cold war here. What did a lot of people build in their backyards? Bonders bonkers. So they were doing this also. So you get areas here. I see there's a slight of India up at the moment. Kappa dosha region is very well known for those get underground. How do they know to get into initially? I think initially, I mean you've got literally fire coming down from the sky. Think of the lightening bolts fire. I mean if you've got a cave there, you go into it. It's the only thing that is going to protect it. Protect these houses are useless. All that burns. I mean you've got literally fire coming down. Think of his fire lightning that is going to set things on fire and you're entirely incinerate that. Just lightening everywhere. Almost like rainfall.

Speaker 3:          00:40:58       Yes, yes, yes. In certain areas, and that's why you have huge sheets of glass in some cases. Wow. So that's. Wow. Yeah, and so you're incinerating everything where it hits ice, it's flash pricing. It is hitting water. It's vape to this massive flooding, so it's causing massive flooding. It's dumping all the ice ultimately into the oceans, which is causing rising sea levels, but more importantly it's causing massive precipitation, massive flash floods and loss. Are we talking about? Incredible. I think incredible because for instance, we had can document linguistically, and this is other people's work, but I think it ties right in. They haven't been explained it cogently otherwise that there is. For instance, in Turkey, middle east, there is a constriction of the population to the anatolia region, kappa dosha, where you have these underground shelters, you have a geology that was easy to go into and escape and linguistically we can map back into european languages to a small pocket that survived there at the end of the last ice age.

Speaker 3:          00:42:10       Wow. So you know, I think there was a massive around the world, you would've had populations being constricted and then they spread out again and when they were constricted, there's. I see the slight there for the linguistic data, when you constrict down in one area, of course you lose a lot of the technology. You lose a lot of the high culture if you go back to a much more primitive stage, and that's what we find. So we find, for instance, in anatolia, a western Turkey, no near asia as it was called in ancient times, you find not only of course you go things like comE back lay tappy, which goes back before this huge catastrophe with the monumental stone mega list, et cetera. But what you find there are 2000 years later in the same general area, you find friends since childhood, which is a bunch of mud brick houses all clustered together.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Uh, it's gone down. It's gone into what I call an acadian. I call sit at this solar induced dark age where they lost a lot of it, not unlike an analogy, I think it's easy for people understand analogies, the end of the roman empire and everything that was lost there and then go into a much more primitive state, um, with the dark ages to the european dark ages. In this case, uh, you look at the, um, technology. It was much higher during the roman empire until maybe 1000 or 1200 a d again, in many realms. Same thing here, although this was such a mighty throwback, it took thousands of years for people to reemerge and at least start to get up to the status now. And they had been before, presented this in front of other scholars. Yes. Yes. It's getting at. Well, there's a lot of resistance. Look, I'm an academic. I, I don't want to sound the wrong way. I'm not looking for sympathy, but going out on limbs like this going just beginning with the reading of the sphinx and that's what we, we didn't even finish with that yet, but that's okay. We'll get back to that. Got plenty of time. Yeah. Um, there's a lot of resistance to anything that's new. Any new concepts, new ideas,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       textbooks have been rich and people I've stayed. Stayed robin given out.

Speaker 3:          00:44:38       Yeah, pay a. They've staked their reputation on it and I understand that and I try not to be that myself, you know, the old. This is my pet theory, but I do try and look at the evidence. I think that slowly we're building up more and more interest more and more, um, at least people looking at objectively and uh, I do see changes occurring. Uh, one thing I'll mention right now is, as of relatively recently, knots are still very, very small, but at boston university I've been allowed to found what is called the iso, see the institute for the study of the origins of civiliZation, which is really just me at the moment, but I want to build it up and I'd like To get, I'm not trying to sound the wrong way, but I'd like to get people to donate to it, etc. ETc.

Speaker 3:          00:45:30       I'm also, I've, uh, found it with some colleagues of mine, uh, including some academic colleagues or cool, which stands for the organization, for the research of ancient cultures. So we're bringing into the mainstream both as a private, not for profit foundation as a institute through boston university to really be looking at these things in a, when I say professional way, what I mean by that is, you know, evidenced based way, um, but also looking outside the standard dog must have standard boxes, standard paradigms and the standard vested interest because so much science. Now people say to me all the time, they think science is supposed to be objective. Well, maybe it Is supposed to be objective, but who are the scientists doing it? They have all their subjective biases and notions and vested interest. I'm not trying to knock anyone but,

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       but it's a fact. It is in. It's just a human fact. Yeah. Are, we're all humans. And one of the things that happened in that documentary from 1993 that I was kind of stunned by was the reaction by the conventional egyptologists when you brought up this evidence where he was very dismissive, almost mockingly in this weird sort of a way where he was like, what, what, what culture? Where's this? Where's the evidence in this culture? Absolutely. And it's kind of gross. It is. It is. Because that really should not have any place in his mind. He was in pain and being called. I've been called a pseudo scientists. Um, look, I, I, again, I don't want to sound the wrong way, but I think I'm as well as well credentialed as anyone. I mean, among my academic colleagues, uh, you know, well that's why I appreciate you that you have stuck your neck out for so long doing this research and since that time have I been punished? Yes. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. Let's. No, I'll be honest. You know, I haven't gotten necessarily the, I've

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       had colleagues say to me in no uncertain terms very well, meaning that I could have had a wonderful career and had all of the promotions, advancements going up through the academic, you know, ladder if you would, with no problems if I just stuck to my, you know, some little specialty that no one really cared about. Hm. You know, I'm.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       But you've had an impact, a gigantic impact on people like me that have a really about, about

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       continue to work on. For instance, one of my specialties as a graduate student was paleocene esc in malmo evolution. Would I be talking to you about that

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       now? Maybe if it's a, if it was interesting, but less likely, less likely from seeing your skeletons and whatnot and skulls. I might be. He might be. Now. When you were doing that, you were talking to that guy. One of the things that he was saying in this dismissive ways, where's the evidence of this culture? Well now we have go beckley tell. Absolutely because is the evidence because that

Speaker 3:          00:48:31       that was an american association for advancement of science debate on the sphinx, which turned out I thought I was going in for a real debate. I thought it was going to be a great debate. We're really going to discuss the evidence back and forth. I brought all my data, the seismic data, which is very, very important, which we haven't even touched on yet. Other types of data we haven't touched on because I want to make the point is much more than a little bit of weathering on the sphinx and I've heard so many critics, even to my face, they say, well, you don't redate civilization based on a weathering profile. No, I've goT lots more than weathering profile. The weathering profile and erosion. the easiest thing to explain and yes, it's what I saw initially in that first 30 to 120 seconds because that's before I brought in equipment and work with tom to becky to do seismic work, to do other types of more detailed analysis.

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       I would not be talking to you today if it was just a national profile. I for my own self, I wouldn't put enough stock in that yet, but when it ties in with everything else, we have a coach and picture. Um, but getting back to someone being dismissive like that, that was 1992. The beckley tap bay had technically been discovered back in the 19 sixties, but they misdated it completely. They thought was maybe a thousand or 2000 years old byzantine or roman greco roman period, not end of the last ice age, not, you know, 12,000 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       And how did they make the distinction that it was 12,000 years old is based on the soil samples. That

Speaker 3:          00:50:10       was, that was klaus schmidt. Klaus schmidt went back to it in about 1994 95. So a couple of years after that. Dismissive comment from the egyptologist mark laner, who I think is the specific person you're referring to at the american association for the advancement of science debate, which I just went to make the comment. I went into that thinking that was going to be a debate. I came out of it realizing that they were just trying to set me up to put me down and shut me up forever, which they were not successful in doing. Do you think that they're so reluctant to just listen to the evidence and look at the information and, and, and consider the possibility that maybe there had been an ancient civilization because it upsets the standard timeline, the standard standard story. And it also upsets a lot of people's concept of progression.

Speaker 3:          00:51:00       And uh, this is something John Anthony West like to talk about the whole, he called it the church of progress. That we've gotten better and better and better. And I talked to so many people that think that we are the end all and be all were the best that there ever has been. Well, maybe we are in terms of certain types of technology and I'm not making any claim that people in the past could ever do what we're doing now doing a podcast with all the electronics, but as I pointed out, that also makes us really vulnerable to things. But I would argue that there is a not so remote possibility that they knew things that we don't know, that they may have understood things that we don't understand. They may have had a worldview that would benefit us to at least have a feel for it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:49       Um, I mean, I don't want golf on spiritual tangents. I could, if I want to, our philosophical tangent, but I also have a training as anthropologists. Anthropologists, I have an undergraduate degree in anthropology on top of everything else. and I'm fascinated by human approaches to life and the environment and their situation. And I'm convinced that we do have thingS to learn from the ancients, whether it's the really remote ancients or the more recent ancients for only 5,000 years ago, even dynastic Egypt. Um, and that it's not all simply a one way progress that there are fits and starts that there have been high points and low points and high points again, and I'm not frankly convinced that we're at the highest point when it comes to certain aspects. We might be a high point with certain types of technology, but I'm not convinced that we're at a high point when it comes to, um, stone construction.

Speaker 3:          00:52:52       Whoa. Certainly not with stone construction. So there are types of technology. We are not high point with much less gay into this philosophical or spiritual or whatever you want to call it. And we don't think of it as technology because we think of technology as being something that's electronic. That's right. That's right. And there are other technologies and if you asked me how did they build the pyramids, I will tell you, I don't know if you asked me how they constructed the sphinx temple. They carved out those huge blocks of stone that can waive 50 or more tons and move them in such tight spaces with such tight tolerances. I don't know. I mean, I'm not going to. No one really knows, no one really knows and some paints people say, you know, you bring in thousands of slaves or whatnot. Well, there's no evidence for that.

Speaker 3:          00:53:36       And where would you have them stand when you're building the sphinx temple? You know, there's not enough room to gather. Round stones are so big. Even thousands of slaves struggled to move them. It's not like something like that. Yeah. Just get a couple of buddies. We're going to move this couch. Yeah, yeah. We're not talking about that. No, no, no. And yeah, you can try to hypothesize levers and that type of thing, but it's. This has been said before and I've seen it questioned there in person, but I've seen off the record document, you know, footage of it when they've tried to just construct a little pyramid with very small blocks and then they end up using modern machines and they still weren't very successful. I mean, so they knew they knew a lot. So there's a real resistance, I find among allow my academic colleagues to one to even suggest that people could have known things in the past that we don't know now, or If they knew something in the past that we don't know now, it was so trivial that it was worth forgetting.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Worth not worrying about all should. There's this, that concept. I find it amazing and I hate to be stereotypical, some broad brushing, but many egyptologists when I read their works or I listened to them at conferences, etc. And I get the impression that they might love egyptology and studying the ancient egyptians, but they also have this view that, oh, these guys made wonderful temples and had some fantastic art, but really, you know, they're sort of primitive and [inaudible] isn't that silly? And you see what I mean. It's like the very thing they station. Yeah. The very thing they study, they put down in a sense to Build themselves up and to build up this idea of ultimate progress that we Can. Exactly. Exactly, exactly. Then you also have in Egypt tall g, and I wouldn't give you another example of this, not just me bringing in scientific evidence and data and the egyptologists rejecting it, but just recently in the last couple of years, have you heard about the project on the great pyramid, the big void, they've been using mammography, which is a highly sophisticated technique using muon set come from outer space or come from the atmosphere.

Speaker 3:          00:55:51       They go through the pyramid. You can set up detectors longterm and pick these up. They're sort of like x, think of x rays technology, but using muons, uh, which are sort of exotic particle that most people are not aware of because they just pass right through us without interacting. But when you've got massive stone, massive stone will block some of them so you can pick up essentially image over a long period of time. So this is really high tech physics, very expensive. A consortium of physicists did work on the great pyramid. I think it's still ongoing, but they put up, you know, tens of millions if not more worth of a high, you know, sophisticate physical physics equipment, gathered all this data. I've seen the raw data. I have a degree in geophysics, geology and geophysics. I have some aBility to evaluate this type of data, whereas I hate to say aloud the egyptologist don't.

Speaker 3:          00:56:51       Um, and I found that with my own data when I shared my own data that not to be nasty, but they didn't know what they were looking at, which is somewhat understandable since it's not their training. Right. So you have with the great pyramid, just recently in the last couple of years, published in nature of very prestigious journal, they found what they believe is evidence for a huge void above the grand gallery that has never been known before. Um, and yeah, there we have a picture of it. The egyptologist had been so resistant to this saying, this is nonsense. There can't be, we don't. Basically we, there can't be anything new that we don't know about are. If it is, it's just trivial. It's just some space between the rocks. it's nothing important, but what I wanted to say, what's really important, some egyptologists actually called for the whole project to be closed down because they don't like the results and they called it quote propaganda because down, but you'll cut that closed down the whole scientific project. They don't. Not only do they not want to look at the data, they'll want more data collected that might contradict their standard.

Speaker 4:          00:58:06       That's fascinating that someone would actually call for them because this isn't even their study of their field of study. Right, so you're dealing with physical evidence that they're saying is nonsense, but this is not something they study in the first place. So there's this void that we're looking at here in these images. Can you explain to people that are just listening what we're seeing?

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       Oh, what you're seeing is they call it a hidden chamber there, but you can see how it's parallel to the grand gallery. The grand galleries is huge gallery that goes up to the king's chamber and the great pyramid

Speaker 4:          00:58:36       and that's deep in the pyramid. The pyramid in chambers above bobbitt

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       parallel shit is maybe close to the same size of it. It's hard to tell with until it gets prob, you know, you'd have to dro into it and maybe put a camera in. But I've seen the raw data. My point is I've seen the raw data. I certainly think it's important they're interpreting it correctly now. The proof will be in the pudding as they say if they ever entered or at least put a probe into it, but my point right now is to just dismiss the data is nonsense to call for the whole project to be shut down is non client project and some of the Egypt Egypt in Egypt. Tologist. I'm close close to the ministry and my point

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       is they've done the same thing to me. So for instance, when we did seismic work and we found the chamber under the left pog this sphinx, that's never been explored since, at least not to my knowledge. And they just dismiss it and say, we know there's nothing there. Um, and that was despite the fact that we also found the chamber at the rump of the sphinx, which I didn't know about the time, but they already knew about. So it confirmed that our data was good because we were finding something they knew about, but when we find something that they don't know about and they don't want to be there, they dismiss it and don't want to pursue it further. Do you have explored one of those chambers? Correct. Instead they explore the one that's in the rump. The one in the rump? Yes. The one in the rump by it turns out they already knew about it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       It's probably not super significant. It probably is just maybe a greco roman or late period, you know, burial or, or some kind of excavation. The one I believe is important is under the left palm, the sphinx, which I believe is a archive actually may go back to this very early period because we now have hieroglyphic evidence indicating that what, what is the evidence indicates it's an archive. Okay. So recently, and this gets back to, um, the sphinx? yes. Okay. So we started this portion of the discussion with the sphinx in my initial observations of the spanx and one of my observations was that there's something going on with the weathering and erosion on the sphinx. The second observation, this is within the first two minutes at most, was that the head is too small for the body. The head is not eroded the way the core body is.

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       It's not erode the way the walls at the sphinx enclosure or it's not the original head. I hate to say it this way, but I knew immediately that was not the original head, just from a geological point of view and I believe that's now since been fully confirmed, that this is not the original head. It wAs a recurved head. So for a long time the question has been in my mind, and we talk about this event, I'm mystery of the sphinx. What was the original head of the sphinx? What was the sphinx? Originally? We've speculated and other people speculate. My have been a lion, for instance, leo, because it faces on the equinox, the constellation, leo in the sky. Not today, but 10,000 bc or so, more or less at the very end of the last ice age. Now I've had a lot of colleagues of mine, academic colleagues say that's nonsense. You know, it doesn't mean anything because they weren't even recognizing the constellations back then. Um, we now have plenty of evidence, at least some of the constellations that we recognize today. A leo, I would put in that category. A tourist is in that category. Uh, ryan is in that core category. Some of them, we don't have evidence

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       for it, but the ones I just mentioned, the, the, um, they, these are constellations that go back well into the end of the last ice age. We have documents of that. We have mammoth bones where you have a ryan carved on it. We have tourists shown in cave walls. We have leo shown. So it's to me, it's fascinating that some of these constellations that we recognize today, we're recognized tens of thousands of years ago. So to me it's not nonsense that they carved a structure 10,000 bc approximately that was facing its own image in the sky. So one suggestion was that maybe it's leo, but recently manu safe today, dr. Mondo saves a day and another colleague of mine, he recognized initially that there is a title, what's known as a dual title in dynastic Egypt that goes back to the fourth dynasty and even back to the first dynasty with the earliest writing and it when properly translate, it basically refers to the sphinx as the guardian up an archive and not the sphinx is we think of it as a lion with a human head, but as a lioness.

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       And there was a name for this line, this method she was the goddess met hit who guarded archive. Um, and we wrote a paper on that. When I say we, my new safe day, myself and robert duvall, who you may know us from a ryan correlation, some of his, his work ties in with this, the rko astronomy. But we've now found that there is this sign, which we named the jaw signed and honor. That's awesome. Under John Anthony West. Uh, there it is. There's the jaw sign and what you see here, it's a lioness met hit, which was the sphinx originally based on our reconstruction and interpretation and can't go into all the details. Now you can actually. People can read the paper. If I could put a plug in. If people go to my website, www dot robert schoch and that's r o b e r t r o b e r t s c h o c h.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       The main thing is my name is spelled s c h o c h, so www dot robert [inaudible] dot com. They can go. I did a popular summary of the paper and they can also go and download the original paper and the peer reviewed journal archeological discovery where we argue that what we have here is that line has met him. She has what looks like a bent rod coming out of her back. Then people look at the actual image and then aBove it is a aCts. So yeah, it's, it's a primitive acts. Um, when I say primitive, even for the ancient egyptians in dynastic Egypt, that would have been sort of a symbolIc acts if you would, which was a sign of someone who was in charge of things you oversee or that type of thing that bent rod. What is that? That's a primitive key.

Speaker 3:          01:05:31       We would now call the primitive key, but it represents a key and so it's basically saying that this is the guardian of the archives have met, hit the locked chamber or vault of method and we also have images. I see it up on the board now. If you look at, you've got the linus with the key and you also have a line not in that image by different image that we had before. If you look at that, can you see how there's a linus a diagrammatic shape over what looks like a facade. Okay. If you then go to the stella that sits between the paws of this finks, you have the same image, much more artistically rendered of the sphinx sitting over a facade over what looks like a building. It's not really a building. It's the archive underneath. I believe, which I know there's something underneath because long ago in the early 19 nineties, thomas to becky and I, when we did seismic work around the sphinx, we found the chamber under the paws of the sphinx and it's I'm sure an artificial chamber.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       It's very regular and this I believe could well be. I'm hypothesizing and in science we make hypothesis that are testable. This is perfectly testable. All we have to do is enter that chamber. Even if it's just to put fiber optic down and we can see is it an artificial chamber that's an archive. Hopefully there's still things there or maybe it was gutted and cleaned out at some point, but here we have the seismic work. One of the seismic maps, I'll call it to a data and what's label is normally a under the left paw that is the chamber we found under the left paw that the egyptologists have to deny ever since and they don't want to explore it and we haven't gotten permission. It doesn't make any sense to me. Well, I know, but this is. If there's physical evidence, this is politics in Egypt.

Speaker 3:          01:07:45       God, it's so squirrely. Yeah. Yeah. So now, okay, this is 1991 or so early. Nineteen nineties. As of last year, 2017. We have textual evidence, ancient hieroglyphs talking about this chamber, talking about this finks talking about the sphinx being alignness guardian, a chamber, and I want to point out that the earliest hieroglyphs that we have that refer to this are about 30 3030 100 bc, which is hundreds of years before the egyptologists claim. The sphinx was even thought about being carved, which is somewhere around 2,500 bc. One, 500 bc back sides with the construction. The great pyramid of giza. Okay, well that's another question. Oh, so we'll come back to that because I don't buy the. It's more. Can we come back? Yes, yes, yes. So the age of tall just claimed that the sphinx was first car of 2,500 bc. Yet there's no mention of the carving of the sphinx. Then they cite the inventory, not inventory stella.

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       That's another step. They cite the top most of fourth dream. Stella, which is a thousand plus years later, which had one point, a partial cartoon of kafra, partial cartouche of coffer, which has since flaked away, was there reputedly in the 19th century. There were drawings of it, um, which we to put in our plugin, just if people are interested in gaining more information. Robert duvall and I wrote a book last year published last year called origins of the sphinx, where we discuss a lot of this but met hit is a more recent discovery. Um, so there was a partial cartouche of kafra, which egyptologists said, aha, this proves that kafra carved the sphinx because the sphinx, it's due east of crawford pyramid coffer was the pharaoh and 2,500 bc. Therefore the Sphinx must be 2,500 bc. I contend, and robert duvall and other people who are in our line of thinking content that this stella that's over a thousand thousands, sorry, over a thousand years later, does not say that it carved.

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       He carved the sphinx, but that he restored the sphinx just like most moses, the fourth who was putting up the stella was restoring the sphinx. And when you look at the sphinx, it has been restored numerous times, including blocks of limestone that were put onto it to restore some of the very ancient weathering that when I asked sy hawala, while my biggest critics, how old those blocks are, he said they were fourth dynasty. Now, why would you restored in the fourth dynasty when it had just been built, you know, literally a century or two ago. You don't need to restore a meter worth of weathering. Um, his, his answer, and I'm not trying to make fun of him, is that it's rotten rock that wasn't very high quality rocks was how somehow it just crumbled away, you know, meter or so, a couple of hundred years.

Speaker 3:          01:10:51       Graham hancock. Yeah. But that's another issue. I don't want get into that. Okay. BeCause, uh, let me just say it this way, there, there's, there was not just science going on there, there was politics going on. So, you know, there's a lot going on. There's a lot going on. Exactly. Exactly. I've seen it too and I've known all these people for a very frustrating decades. Yeah. So I'm trying to keep just to the science right now, but so he himself admits that some of these repairs go BaCk well over 4,000 years, which makes no sense if it's always 4,500 years old. Exactly, exactly. And they've always contended there was no inscriptions or anything really referring to the sphinx until new kingdom times. We point out in origins at the sphinx, robert paval night that no, you have to know what they were calling the banks. And now with matt hit, we have inscriptions.

Speaker 3:          01:11:48       They find that. And when did they find this lioness. And when do they, when you're saying this is very recent. Yeah, manu saves the day. My coauthor just discovered that, um, I don't know exactly when he found the inscription, uh, but he first pointed it out to robert duvall myself about a year ago, a year ago, and we all worked on it and confirmed it and put together the pieces. I mean, he really gets the most credit for it. Um, he's, he, he knows his heart gliffy really where they find this higher glyphic of this. The, um, it's shoWn in several different, uh, uh, ancient artifacts. So for instance, there is a statue of vca, uh, from the fourth dynasty who may have actually overseeing the construction of the great pyramid, or I would say the reconstruction of the great pyramid because I might get back to that. I think the peer at great pyramid, just like the sphinx was being reconstructed refurbished, if you would, during the old kingdom, not constructed de novo, but he was overseeing that he must have had something to do with the sphinx.

Speaker 3:          01:13:02       Um, he was apparently the, um, given the title of being the overseer for the sphinx, that type of thing, but it turns out this title was something he had in cuckoo's time, which is the, the, the pharaoh before supposedly when the sinks is built to begin with. So that messes up the Egypt logical thinking right there. Um, but this title was something that had been held by others before him back down to about 31 or so hundred bc, you know, 5,000 years ago, again, 500 or more years before the swings was supposedly built. Uh, so now we hAve this hieroglyphic text that goes back refutes what the egyptologist are saying, and not only that, but when you look at the way they wrIte it, this is the earliest writing, so it's not surprising. We don't have anything earlier. Maybe eventually we'll find earlier, you know, the precursors, but they are also in the context, it seems abundantly evident they're referring to it as a very old structure.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       Wow. Now how do egyptologists receive this? Uh, it's just making its way into the Egypt logical community if we will see how they received. So far there's been no reaction. No, no, I'll just put it that way. No, not that I know officially. Well, you've seen it all before. So I've seen it all before and you know, it's a classic thing to that in some cases. So I'll, I'll put it related to the sphinx and maybe hopefully somewhat analogous. I pointed out decades should go and John Anthony West and I working on this, that this finks the head is not the original head and I'm not sure if I'm the very first one to ever say that I'm not going to try to take credit, but it was quite obvious to me when I, as I mentioned, without anyone saying that to me, I had not heard that someone else suggested that since then egyptologist with, of course out ever citing me or John Anthony West have also been suggesting that in some cases, and some have suggested that maybe it was [inaudible] face on the sphinx rather than coffers face after we brought in frank domingo who demonstrate that's not coppers face a frank domingo, if you remember from mystery of the sphinx, was a New York city police officer, forensic expert who literally would reconstruct faces, compare faces that was his business.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       And To present it in court, uh, he analyzed the face of the Sphinx in the face of kafir, also known as schaeffer on the pharaoh. The egyptologists before our time, before we got involved in this, always said these were the same faces to face of the sphinx. The face of copper, a frank domingo came out very definitively that they're not the same face and they're both competent artists. They're not frankly the same ethnicity of face. Uh, and for mark laner to publish in national geographic that I'll paraphrase, some of the sphinx came alive when he reconstructed with the face of chef ron or face of conference just, that's not science, that's, um, you know, wish fulfillment or something. He wanted it to be the face of a certain pharaoh. He does computer construction with it, having the face of the pharaoh he wants it to be. And then past the ad off is somehow, um, I guess science. So there's no egyptologist not necessarily science either. And I'm not saying that a nasty way, but it's an important point because egyptology, a lot of egyptologists classically come more from a art history background, that type of thing. So tying in with the question you asked before, I literally. It's funny how things work. I literally, when I was in graduate school, took a seminar in sciences

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       and other disciplines, you know, this was because I was being trained as a scientist and one of the papers we had to read at the time, this was long before I ever thought about going to Egypt was how egyptologists are resistant to scientific information and scientific data and how to help try to overcome that. If you're working with egyptologist basically what's the answer was it's very difficult and it's not to put them down because I have lots of colleagues and other fields that are not sciences, but classically I would contend egyptology is not a science. It comes more from art history or from linguistic studies, you know, translating hieroglyphs, um, historical studies and those are all very important academic studies. But you do sometimes get people in a certain field and they're resistant to outsiders from another field, especially when they think it's a field that's so far apart and so diverse from what they understand, what they know, their own mindset.

Speaker 1:          01:18:15       Yeah. And their mindset is not geared towards scientific data. And I'm not. Again, I'm not trying to be nasty, it's just have to explain yourself. Yeah, you're not coming across nasdaq. So when you initially saw these erosion features and and you the first 30 to 90 seconds or whatever, you said it was 120 seconds when you first looked at it and new, did you have any idea that your life would take the turn that it's taken? I mean, did you have any indication thrown into such a shit storm? All these years later? We are in 2018. You're still fighting the good fight. I know as John Anthony West one said introducing me. Um, he ruined. He ruined my life. Twenty five years later after that documentary, you're still swinging. I dunno, I dunno. I'm still getting attacked and I'm still.

Speaker 3:          01:19:08       The answer is no. I was naive. I was incredibly naive at the time. I still was not that far out of graduate school.

Speaker 1:          01:19:17       You thought you could just present? Yeah. Stand on its own and just present the said man, what a great new discovery. Exactly. That was it, and I was so naive

Speaker 3:          01:19:28       and so we first present the evidence at the geological society of America annual meeting in 1991, I guess it was. Yeah, 1991, and I want to say bluntly, the vast majority of geologists, hundreds, literally thought, oh, this is amazing. This is great. it made, started making some headlines around the world. Literally, there were one or two geologists there that turns out. Turns out we're working for egyptologist. They didn't think this was so great because they saw the implications for the Egypt illogical colleagues and they started, you know, a little rumbling there. Then the journalists come in back then you'll know internet like we have it now, just phones and the journalists start calling egyptologists that we're not there, had not seen the data, etc. Immediately they were telling the journalists at this has to all be nonsense that hundreds of egyptologists have studied this for, you know, two or three centuries, which is total nonsense.

Speaker 3:          01:20:29       It turns out I knew every egyptologists because they're so few that have actually stayed the sphinx personally, surely just to. So. So yeah, they were just trying to dismiss it and then the egyptologists come back and say we know this is nonsense essentially. I'm paraphrasing, we know that the pyramids were not built by aliens so they start bringing aliens and you have photos. So essentIally just to dismiss, dismiss me and I wasn't talking about total straw. Yeah, I wasn't talking about pyramids, number one, we could talk about that if you want to. And I wasn't talking about aliens. They hadn't been there, they hadn't seen the data. It was so bizarre in hindsight. And I'm so frustrated trying to defend their positions and they were just, they were really just attacking. And then in Egypt at one point they were um, putting things in the arabic press.

Speaker 3:          01:21:23       Little did they know, I have friends that would read it to me and they were saying that I wasn't even a faculty member at boston university, which is outright lie since I had just been tenured. So there Was no doubt I was a faculty member there. But this was other academic saying this, but they never thought we'd get back to me. I mean really, really mean. And nasty, I'm so game back to the evidence. So they set up in, this was I think unprecedented within months. They'd set up this debate at the triple a s american association for the advancement of science. And I thought again, I was so naive, I thought, oh, this is wonderful. Fine though. We'll get rid of all this nonsense in this name calling and you know, the stuff in the popular press that no journalists, you can't blame them. They don't know what's going on necessarily and will really get the evidence out and we'll be able to discuss it. Um, sanely and objectively turns out that wasn't the case at all. It was just from my perspective, they were just calling me more names and trying to set up straw men. And

Speaker 4:          01:22:29       is this the egyptologist who was in that documentary who dismissed everything was still around. Oh yeah. And has he amended his position at all?

Speaker 3:          01:22:37       Not to my knowledge. I haven't spoken with him for years and years and years. Did yoU ever speak with them off the record personally alone? What is this? Oh, I, I'll tell you this, but he didn't say was off the record. I was, I guess was off the record. I don't think I would have said this years ago, but I'll say it now at that debate, at that debate, aaa's debate. He, I just suddenly found myself in the hall with him and there was no one else around so he could totally deny this. But it's true. My perspective, at least he, um, said something to me like, you know, you don't really believe this. I know you don't really believe this. You just want to be on television and, you know, be famous or something like that. He said, I said, no, I really do believe it. Or you know, I really go by the evidence and I do think the evidence says this.

Speaker 3:          01:23:32       And he served. He was telling me that, no, you don't, you know, he was like, I don't know. I analyze what the sizing you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then he lead in and then, and then what he does is he starts asking me a question of some detailed question about the geology and well, if that's the case, how can such and such and I think in hindsight might have been fed to them by some geo archeologists. They called someone who does archeology but knows a little geology. Uh, and I, I realize in hindsight it was meant to be one of those gotcha questions. I guess they say nowadays where I wouldn't be able to answer it, but no, I had, of course I'd thought about it. It was to me as a geologist, very obvious. So I start giving him this detailed explanation as to why that's not the case and why, you know, my evidence stands up, blah, blah blah. And we're standing there face to face. I'm explained this to him and I see his face turn and it goes blank and I'm in midsentence. He just turns around and walks away. He's the one

Speaker 4:          01:24:36       he couldn't, he couldn't refuse,

Speaker 3:          01:24:38       can refute what I was saying and he wasn't really answered. My takeaway is that he wasn't interested in discussing it rationally or aunts, you know, he just went to, um, when the debate or whatever, he.

Speaker 4:          01:24:53       No, when he knew that he

Speaker 3:          01:24:55       wasn't going to with you, he just got out of there. Yeah. Yeah. And again, you know, it was a, just a personal thing. There was no other witnesses to my knowledge of this, but if he had really wanted to discuss things, I was willing to discuss it with them

Speaker 4:          01:25:09       and it's so disturbing that someone would put their own egos so far above the information that needs to be distributed to scholars and people and students and all these folks out there that have questions about the history of the human race. it's someone would put their own reputation and eagle above all of that and not have the, the, the, the mindset to realize, well, we have new evidence and what we thought of before. We're going to have to apply to this new evidence and create a new timeline. It doesn't dismiss all the things that they learned in the past. No, no.

Speaker 3:          01:25:41       That's something. In fact, I'm glad you brought that up because I long contended that people talk about rewriting history, etc. Well, yes, I understand that argument and I think we do need to rewrite good chunks of our very early history, but I've never denied dynastic Egypt in the basic chronology for dynastic agent. Now what I say that we've got a whole new chapter to add to it going back in time plus, and I won't mention the great pyramid here, plus things like the great pyramid, the standard dating for the great pyramid, let's say 20 5:50 bc or so, the pharaoh khufu also known as cheops. Just in case people hear those terms. I don't deny that he had something to do with the great pyramid, but when I study it geologically and I don't want to get into great detail here. When I study a geologically, I think there was a older structure there.

Speaker 3:          01:26:36       I think there was something else there. For instance, a subterranean chamber I suspect goes back much earlier than the time of fourth dynasty khufu. So for instance, to bring in robert [inaudible], he has his awry in correlation of the three pyramids to the belt. Stars have a ryan, which correlate very well at about 10,500 bc. So he'll talk and we talk about this in our joint book, origins of the sphinx, how there was a master plan going back to that period. A lot of people have said that, well, that's nonsense. Why would they be following a master plan? Thousands of years later when they finally got around to building these structures. I don't think that's the case at all. I think there were earlier markers are structures at those spots. The pyramids in this case, those three major pyramids were built over or enhanced or restored older structures, if that makes sense.

Speaker 3:          01:27:29       So for instance, under the great pyramid is what I call the sacred mound. It's actually literally a stone outcropping mound and John Paul move wall. I'm robert [inaudible]. Older brother's actually architect robert paval himself was trained as an engineer. They both make the point among are things that if you're building the great pyramid, I mean this is a humongous structure with incredible way. It's much easier to flatten the plateau at that point. Again, nice level base rather than try to build over and around a mound that's to this day incorporate within the great pyramid. This takes a lot more energy and work and it's a much more difficult engineering feat, but it makes sense if you're. You want to preserve that. If it was sacred to them or whatever. That older structure. We have images of the soldiers structure. Oh, you can't see it at this point because it's totally covered, but we have something very analogous, and I know you mentioned this when John Anthony West was on the red pyramid, is also built over an older structure and you can see that to this day in one of the chambers where you have this much older structure.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       I'm talking geologically now based on the evidence. Then we have some images there where you have this older weathered structure, which I believe goes back. I don't know how much older but thousands of years old or let's just leave it that and then they built the pyramid over it and around it, I think marketing it, you know, refurbishing and much older structure and you can tell by the weathering and the stuff, whether it's stone, whether constructed. Exactly. And you can see the sharp divide between the older structure and the newer structure, which is nice. Finally cut stone. And that newer structure goes back earlier than the great pyramid. I mean, this is snefru. This is even earlier by a generation. Uh, so you have this where they're using and dynastic Egypt older structures there, reappropriating them. You have the case here. I believe you have that with the great pyramid.

Speaker 3:          01:29:39       I believe you have to have that with the second pyramid. You have that with the sphinx. Most definitely. And the valley temple and the sphinx temple. The first piece of evidence that really convinced me that something was going on with the sphinx. So the first evidence that I saw that made me suspicious that the egyptologist did not have it right, was within that first 30 to 120 seconds. I described the weathering and the head's too small. The first piece of really solid evidence was looking at the walls of the sphinx and valley temple that were constructed from the stones that came out of the sphinx. Enclosure, we talked about that they are weathered, but then they were cut back a little bit. That weathering was cut back and they were resurfaced or re faced with granted in dynastic times. It's believed. So what you have is a older structure and here's a diagram a for anyone that's looking at, but what you have is older limestone temples, which are massive, which were then faced with granite, but what they did, they did it the hard way. They preserved as much of the older limestone temple as possible before refacing it with granted. So they actually took the time, in some cases to cut the backs of the granite blocks to fit the weathered surface of the limestone. Wow. Whether it would be much easier, you have plenty of rock there. Just skim down the limestone. Totally make a nice flat surface and then replaster so speak regranted it. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       What you all chipping away the old rock that shipped with the new role because I think it was important for them. It's like if we have a national monument now that goes back to

Speaker 3:          01:31:24       evolutionary war days. He wants to preserve as much of the original structure as possible, even if it makes it more difficult to do the restoration.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       Now you put the effort into it. Just to clarify, so you feel that this time period of the, the coronal mass ejections mass ejections was somewhere around 10,000 bc. Well 9,700 bc and I say that very specific

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       because based on greenland ice core data in particular, you can literally count back year by year and the best estimate is about 9,700.

Speaker 4:          01:32:05       See, you know, give or take a decade or something. So from that point to 2,500 bc, which is where most conventional egyptologists date, the construction of the pyramid, you believe that the great pyramid was probably built on top of this great mound which represented an older structure, but these are the people that their civilization was destroyed and then thousands of years later we're able to somehow or another rebuild

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       thousands of years later. Why don't know if they were rebuilding a nut pyramid as it was before or they were building new pyramid on top.

Speaker 4:          01:32:48       The, they obviously had retained some of the incredible

Speaker 3:          01:32:51       wisdom and knowledge. Well, think of it to this day, I'm a, I'll think of judeo christian islam. Uh, I mean we still have a, like the temple mound. We have places where we know that there were older structures, solomon's temple, et cetera, and maYbe only a fragment of it is left, but we still held in high esteem veneration. Modern structures are built around or over these relics. I think that's a somewhat of an analogy of what the parthenon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you have veneration of older. If I could use that, and I'm not used necessarily using it in religious terms, I mean, could just be respect. Yes. Uh, so I think that for all three of the major pyramids on the giza plateau, we have evidence that there was something there, whether they were pyramids as we see them now, which is quite a possibility and they were just refurbished or something else.

Speaker 3:          01:33:52       Uh, we have evidence that goes back to that much earlier period before the demise of high civilization, if I could put it that way at the end of the last ice age. And then it was reappropriate re-used, rebuilt, restored, whatever term you wanna use in dynastic egyptian times. Uh, when give you another example. Have you been to Egypt? No, I have not. I didn't think you had. You need to come to show thIs to you in person. I wanted to go with you. Your chicken chicken. Scared to go to Egypt. Hurt is dangerous. Not with me. Not with me because I take care of her. No, no. I buy have enough context. I have enough context that I'll go with you immediately get we have to make something happen. Yeah, definitely, definitely.

Speaker 4:          01:34:42       Points of the mountain and digital to give people a perspective of time that t 2000, 500 years ago, the conventional dating of the construction, the grandparents, cleopatra is closer to the construction of the iphone than she is to the construction of the great pyramids. That's just how long a history you're dealing with when it comes to ancient Egypt. So we're talking about thousands and thousands of years for sure. And this is for sure for sure. Like where we absolutely know, forget about all the speculation just from cleopatra to the 2000 fIve hundred bc, which is what almost all the egyptologists except you're dealing with just a giant leap harris, right. Here's the. we could see it here.

Speaker 3:          01:35:31       That's right. And, and so, and we are closer to the dynastic egyptians. Even the old kingdom dynastic egyptians, we are closer to them in time than they were to the end of the last ice age and the demise of that earlier civilization. So a dynastic egyptian dynastic Egypt arose. Rough terms, 5,000 years ago, that was about 3000 bc. That was, they arose over 6,000 years after close to 7,000 years after the end of the last ice age, so that's crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       Yeah, that's hard. Hartford were talking real spans of time here and you're looking at. We're looking at a chart right here. Is there any way, is there a place or were other people can go and see this because it's ongoing.

Speaker 3:          01:36:19       A chart like this is on my website, in the article, if you go to my website, robert shocked again, www dot robert schoch, s c h o c h.com, and go to the website. You'll see charts like this, but what you should do is go to the main page of the website and then I believe it is a research highlights, go to whatsapp, hauled research highlights actually I think for those on the podcast are seeing here and then go to what's called the cita article as did a, and this is what we're looking at a standard on the website now which stands for solar induced dark age today and again, it's ironic. I think that the sun, which of course is pride, couldn't induce a dark age, but when you have a major eruption like this, a major outburst from the sun hitting the earth and all the ramifications we were talking about, it's going to bring any civilization down

Speaker 4:          01:37:15       to its knees. Thousands and thousands of years of rebuilding civilization and rising backup to some still unbelievably incredible technological level. So even if they did rebuild the pyramid at 2,500 bc, it's still this incredible feat. Oh, it's incredible. For years, why 500

Speaker 3:          01:37:35       bc? Before if I could just finish a thought that I started to have, I was saying we have to go Egypt together and I could show you something that we could do a podcast there. Snap. Yeah. I could take you. Among other things around the second pyramid, the second pyramid. You can see evidence. I would point to you that I interpret as going back to an earlier structure. Furthermore, the second period pyramid few people seem to pay attention to this has a ring, a ring of granite around the base. That's significant because they were using granted in many cases and conventional egyptologists who have confirmed to this, confirm this verbally with me. They would use granted when they were indicating they were restoring an older structure and there's no question that granite goes back to the fourth dynasty, just like there's no question that the granite on the valley and sphinx temple goes back to at least the fourth dynasty, if not earlier, but they're using it to restore.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       So we have all of this indication that dynastic Egypt acknowledged that they were restoring older structures. Um, so getting back to where we were just on the great pyramid. So no matter how you look at it to try to do, build a great pyramid today, whether you're talking 2,500 bc or earlier, I mean, how were they doing it? how were they doing? I don't know. I told you I am not going to try to get into how they did. I'm, that's, they did it. It's there. Uh, you know, it's, it's. I have, I thought about a lot. Yes. Whether I'm there in Egypt on site or elsewhere. I mean, it's incredible.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       I don't have any answer for you. Is it possible that the people in that part of the world somehow another survived the coronal mass ejection in and they came out better than the people in other parts of the world that were really knocked into the stone age? No, I don't think there's any evidence for that because, because we seem to have a huge gap around the world, around the gap, but they still historically

Speaker 3:          01:39:46       now what they were doing in Egypt is incomparable. One could argue, so it may well be that they found all the right materials, all the right environments, a nile valley in its height, which is nonsense height. Now, um, you know, at the end of sydney, let's say for a reemergence may have just been, I hate to say the goldie locks words, but just right for everything to come together for this to, you know, come together. It's a very fertile area. It's very easily, uh, uh, defended that type of thing. Um, and also I do want to tie in with what you were saying it is, and I've certainly thought about this. It is possible that a, we are electrical and um, the fluctuating and electric fields, magnetic fields. Did they have some influence if I'm brain development or you know, that's real speculation, but I wouldn't say it's impossible either. So, so

Speaker 1:          01:40:51       these people, is it possible they retained some

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       of the knowledge from thousands of. I think they definitely retaining knowledge, just like we have monasteries in europe during the dark ages retaining knowledge. And what's interesting is in some cases you would retain chunks of knowledge that don't even make sense out of context except that they know they're important. They're no, they're valuable. What kind of examples? Well, I think in europe where you would have um, uh, pieces of technology that would be retained, but you don't have the whole complex or thinking literary terms. That's probably the easiest where you have parts of like a history of alexander where the whole thing did not survive, but you know, six out of nine chapters or whatever survived. And even Though they knew it was an incomplete manuscript, they would make numerous copies of the incomplete manuscript. Knowing that it was important, sort of like the goals.

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       Oh yeah, there's another example, although the dead sea scrolls potentially were absolutely complete, or at least most of them are complete when they were buried and you know, put away for storage. A lot of them, the incomplete lists there may be because they degrade it because they were discovered by, you know, locals who have been tore them apart. And so pieces here or there, I'm referring more to a situation where you have ancient knowledge, our ancient manuscripts and even though say the monks and a monastery knew that this was not a complete manuscript, they knew that even in its incompleteness, it was important to maintain as much of it as possible. It's just stunning that civilization that was knocked down like every other civilization, somehow or another 2,500 bc rose to this incredible level of construction that is just unparalleled anywhere else on the planet. And it did it very, very quickly, very quickly.

Speaker 2:          01:42:48       Uh, which I think does, is it indicative potentially that they were reusing knowledge that had been passed down and somehow maybe things just clicked together. Maybe it took one genius to start putting things together. And that set off a renaissance if you would. I mean we've seen that historically and much more recent times that maybe perhaps the understanding of how it was built and designed is more prevalent amongst the civilization amongst the community than maybe it would be today. Yeah. So I mean there's still a lot of unanswered questions here, obviously. Yeah. Obviously it's incredible incredible stuff, but I think we're starting to get more toward an answer or at least getting the broader outlines of what is going on. Wow. This is so fascinating to think that this could potentially happen to us. Well, that it's not the only fast dane. I hate to use the term. It's scary and I think we're incredibly vulnerable and people are not

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       addressing. This is not the type of thing to address for some reason because a major solar outburst and coronal mass ejection and all the related phenomena. We've mentioned this earlier would bring down modern technology as we know it would fry the grid system. YoU'd have high radiation levels. You'd probably have all the flooding. I mean, look what happens now when you have lIttle floods, and I say that as a geologist, not to downplay the horrible disasters we've had, but other factors. For instance, we have nuclear power plants all around the world. We've seen that with a few isolated instances. Chernobyl, three mile island fukushima recently. What happens when you have problems with those? If you cut off power to a nuclear power plant, it's ironic. Lot of people don't realize it. Yes, they generate power, but they need a power supply going into them. IF you fry the grid system, you're essentially going to have meltdowns and radiation.

Speaker 3:          01:44:53       You're going to have problems. And on top of everything else, we're going to bring on this artificial radiation around the world. Uh, I mean, it's, it's, and again, I'm not saying this, I don't have anything to sell. You know, sometimes I hear people talk about this because there was. So they're prepping kid and now they're going to, oh, for so much money, I'll sell, you know, jim baker style. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But no, and I, I hate to even talk about it except I think it's important and I think that one of the things this gets back to that, it's not just sort of academic to study ancient civilization, it's not just fun and interesting, but I think there are things to learn from this and one of the things to learn is that they survived incredible. Well, I don't know if they survive, but they were knocked to their knees, but we, they went through natural catastrophes, which are not unrealistic that we could go through them again and be potentially much more vulnerable than they are than they were at that time. Uh, because we're so reliant on silver. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:02       Are there any hieroglyphs that are convincing or at least point to some of the construction methods of, of the pyramid or of any of the other?

Speaker 3:          01:46:13       Well, you said convincing, I would say no. Now I would say no. Uh, and this gets into the problem to that. Why would you expect that I'm serious because what we have surviving are generally religious, somewhat literary, um, things in tombs. Now I don't buy for a second that the great pyramid was a tumor initially too. That's like saying a huge cathedrals just to tune because you find a couple of bodies there and you've never actually found bodies in the great pyramid oriented, the major pyramids and as you know, I know you know this, the pure construction goes down hill as you go into later dynastic Egypt. So they seem to have either gotten sloppier or just lost some of the technological finesse they had. So you find in some of the tombs these what almost seemed silly pictures of them dragging huge statues on sledges where they're supposedly pouring oil or water in front of it to lubricated.

Speaker 3:          01:47:18       And you know, the egyptologist say, aha, this is how they built it all. We'll try doing that in real life. It doesn't really work. So I think some of that may just be sort of artistic license or metaphor, that type of thing. Do you have any images of that? Uh, but not. Not that I brought with me, but my point is that you wouldn't even expect them to be leaving detailed construction plans are that we wouldn't necessarily find them. Maybe we'll get lucky find someday, but put it this way, if they find a bunch of iphones 12,000 years from now or 5,000 years from now with whichever period we want to find, talk about will they know what they are and even if they know what they are, will we, will they find the plans of how to build one and the factory specifications of all the engineering that goes into it?

Speaker 3:          01:48:11       No. So why would you expect it for the great pyramids? Right. But well, you know, it'd be a lucky, it'd be a lucky find different bid, but how much would that odds are against it? And, and not to throw out too much academia type stuff, but one of the things I study is a graduate school, so I took a series of courses in taxonomy which is basically how did things get preserved focusing on fossils. Um, but the principles apply to other things as well. And as you go back in time, what you expect to survive logarithmically drops off, you know, so you go back to these earlier periods, it's amazing. We have much of anything and what'S going to survive big, massive stone structures, not the plans on papaya iris or sheep skin or whatever of the details of how to build it. That's why what I found particularly offensive about that, um, egyptologist saying, where's the evidence of this culture from 10,500 years ago?

Speaker 3:          01:49:12       Like, what? What do you expect to find? Yeah, exactly. This is what we're talking about. You know, what we find from that earlier period, if you think about our massive stone monumental structures, everything else would be grounded. It was incinerated, it was, it was ground into dust or it was reused in some cases. Sometimes people say, well, they, how could they do that without metal tools will, maybe metallurgy does go back further. Maybe it was lost and then reinvented again. So again, I don't deny the standard timeframe, but there could be a lot of things going back before that. And you have metal. And I'm not trying to focus on metal now and I'm not making any big claims about metallurgy a earlier time, but let's just say for instance, as a thought experiment, if you had metallurgy much earlier than conventional timeframe says, and you had a natural catastrophe like that, are they just going to leave their metal tools all over the place?

Speaker 3:          01:50:13       No, they collect all the scraps of metal possible and recycle and reuse and reuse. we do that to this day. I mean people got, in Massachusetts at least if you have a warehouse and you're not paying attention to it all the time, it's an old warehouse. There have been cases where people have found. Someone broke in not to steal the things in the warehouse, but to steal the copper piping. Right? yeah. That's very common. Now there's some of the more interesting pieces of evidence that came out of the great pyramid and a lot of the other structures of Egypt had been the pottery that's incredibly difficult to reproduce those stone. Well, you just made a mistake. I'm not criticizing you. I said pottery. You said padre, because it's Important distinctions, not monitoring, it is fired in a kiln and fired dearly, carved out really hard stone, which will crack easily if you don't do it just right, so it looks like pottery and that's you used a term colloquially put it that way.

Speaker 3:          01:51:16       Looks like pottery because that's how people imagine, you know, it looks like a beautifully shaped pot, but some of these they go and they go back to the earliest dynastic Egypt and probably much earlier they are carved out really hard granites and schists and nice, you know, these really hard stones and two Incredible tolerances and incredibly thin, incredibly beautifully carved and most importantly to very small opening. Very small openings is. Exactly. And how do you do this? I mean it's just incredible when you have to come to Egypt with us and when we do, we'll look at some of these onsite. There's a bunch in the museum. There's some at a museum at sakara where they had been nice one. Yeah, that's amazing. It looks like a mace. Headers are destined jar, but that's not what we're talking about. That's not. There's much, much nicer.

Speaker 3:          01:52:15       I'm a much nicer in the sense of the finesse of how both arterial, theY were carved out of marble. Different marbles. Two easier ones to do. They would grab them out. diorite granted. Nice. Which is a metamorphic stone schist. These are really hard stones. He's called direct. I'm d, I o r I t e, I believe. Try that because that's what I'm pretty sure I saw one of them. It was carved out of that. And so what we're saying is that these are really hard to carve, that use very narrow openings, like you said, sometimes they put handles on them so they're not just spinning them. Allow lave because how will you get the handles on it because that's not put on separately. It's all car from one. Look at that. Look at that. There's a nice one, a then on vessels and these thousands of these have been found going back to the earliest dynastic times. But what suggested the. Yeah. There's um, how they were carved according to the standard egyptologist. I try to do that without cracking it, without making a mistake, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          01:53:22       Oh, we'll explain what we're looking at. we're looking at some sort of a, um, it looks like a little like amazed that they use scratch out the inside. YeaH. To, um, and maybe they did it and just took a log until. what's the speculation? Other than that, we'll get the one right above it. Jamie, that red one, the red one right above your cursor. That one's incredible. Yeah, they're, they're absolutely incredible. And we can see these on site. So what, what's the circulation?

Speaker 3:          01:53:49       The uh, the, the speculation is that they weRe doing it the same way. They were doing a new kingdom times. So when you look at them and new kingdon times as a general rule, you get things similar to this new kingdoms that say 1500 bC just for round numbers. You get similar types of vases and whatnot, but they're actually to my eye, much cruder. Generally they're made out softer stone, more your calcites sites in limestones and marbles, that type of thing. They geneRally are just not. They'll have the same artistic finesse to them, the same perfection to them and the new kingdom. Egyptians did show diagrams as we just saw how they did it or supposedly did it and that may well be how they were doing it, but I questioned as a geologist whether that would really work for these beautiful harder stone, muCh more perfect in my assessment.

Speaker 3:          01:54:46       Older ones that you find going back to the earliest dynasties and you find in some cases thousands of them. So at sakara, at the step pyramId, generally considered the oldest pyramid, although I would question that, but it's definitely an old pyramid. Even by Egypt biological standards, you found thousands of these really well carved ones from the harder stone, the more artistic ones, if we could call it that sort of a huge horde of them. I don't even think they were necessarily carved at that time. I think this may have been a horde that they had preserved from thousands of years earlier. Service stock poweR museum, if you would. In fact, what we're finding for as many of these quote tombs and temples, not temples, tombs and pyramids, that type of thing, is that maybe the. Essentially they were stockpiles. They were um, the equivalent of, you know, fall out shelter.

Speaker 3:          01:55:39       So if you were you stuck away supplies type of thing that may have been part of the original structure. Some of these are very long next to a very long neck bottoms. Exactly. Sanely difficUlt, like the ones that you've told them, there's ones that are difficult and they have all kinds of curves. And what you have to be careful as I was saying is that you have the really well finished very ancient ones and then you have ancient ones that are from the new cayman only 3000, 3000, 500 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and then what you have, and I Could show you one, and if it's still on display in the egyptian museum, I say still on display because they changed the displace and they're building a new grant Egypt museum as they call it. So it's hard to say in Egypt, in Egypt when we go to Egypt now going say, I can show you one where I'm convinced that it's a very old bowl that was then reused in later times.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       So you see this crude or hieroglyphic inscription on it and you just look at it and you say someone that incredible bowl would not have done such a crude inscription on it this year. I mean, so, and then when we go through each with a megalithic statutes and whatnot, you can find over and over where they would carve on them later. So reappropriate them in later dynastic times, which is still thousands of years ago. So very ancient from our personal perspective, but they were reusing older structures and older, older artifacts. This, the whole subject is so fascinating to me. But this bowl thing is very weird because it's almost like one of the crazier pieces of evidence, but it's dismissed. It's like right under your nose. Oh, it's absolutely dismissed and it's not unlike. And I only think of this because I know you saw it. If you remember when, because I watched the recently to refresh my memory, the podcast where you interviewed John Anthony West and he showed a picture which happened to be my hand.

Speaker 3:          01:57:47       Um, but in mY hand was a little bead that was founded come back. And the thing is, remember that little beat had this, it was a very hard, I'm probably volcanic stone and little teeny hole drilled all the way through it, the long way. So you had a drilling that's, you know, a centimeter or more long going through. It's not just a little hole punch through, but a little tunnel going through. There it is. UM, and you know, how do you do that with quote primitive technology that to me is as amazing as the erection of the pillars, you know, so you have to look at both small scale and large scale and like you say, the bowls may be something you hold in your hand, but they're just justice. Incredible technology. Just like if people were to judge us today, 10,000 years from now, they'd say that iphone is incredible technology even

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       though it's small scale, just like, I guess they would maybe say if anything survives of them, uh, some high rise was a incredible in this is good beckley [inaudible] that would just pulled up jamie. These images. And what are these images of? Looks like a nail or something called earplugs or Bugs. Some people claim that no one really knows exactly what they are. Airports. Yeah. Well, you know, not ear plugs and plug your ears are like, oh, your earrings. I don't know exactly what needs to be. Yeah, they call them buttons there sometimes. What is the speculation, the construction methods of those complicated bowls. What? What do people believe they did, but the bolsa Egypt. Is there any speculations or any installation is that they may have been using some kind of lave for it at least in part, but the problem is you can't turn it and still have the handle sticking if you do standard workout, you know, spinning late type of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:59:46       so there's something else that has to be going on there. I was going to say part of the problem with any of this knowledge being passed down right up into at least the 16 hundreds, early 17, hundreds, you know, there were guilt systems where you would retain knowledge of how you do search and technological things and I think that may go back to very, very ancient times that you don't want to just give out. Right. You know, the knowledge to anyone, but you know, again, I've, I've heard no good compelling and my mind explanation as to how these things were made. Now one of the things that they found in the king's chamber was what they referred to as. They call it a sarcophagus, like what they called the chicago fergus. I preferred the term coffer and it's made out of granite. Aswan, granite. The coffer meaning like almost like a treasure chest treasure chest or a big chest or brock's that type of thing.

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       It's missing its lid and the sarcophagus represents something that you've put a body in. You don't think that's correct? No. Correct. That's why I don't like calling it fergus coffer is more generic, should we say. Right. And doesn't, the king's chamber has some of the more complicated stones, right? Larger. Oh, it has. It's lined with granite. So the primary construction material of. There you go. The primary construction material for the great pyramid is limestone, right? Some of the limestone was quarried pretty much onsite and you can still see the quarries there, other high quality limestone known as tour limestone, which brought from across denial and you can still see the turro limestone quarries and then granite which used for parts of the construction, particularly to line the king's chamber. And this grant, it was brought from southern Egypt, brought up, brought down the nile, I should say, from the south to the north, now flows from the south to the north and it's asked one grant and you're talking about huge blocks of stone up to 90 tons or so have been the estimates for those particular stones in the king's chamber.

Speaker 2:          02:01:55       So when you go into the king's chAmber, it's totally lined with this beautiful red as juan. Granted, you've got this big coffer there that, you know, they give you permission, you can lie in. And, uh, it's a neat feeling, uh, to lie in and a lot of people have, you know, all kinds of experiences, et cetera. It's really incredible. But it is these, this lining is so perfect and so well fit together and you have this, uh, you know, all the sides, a roof, the ceiling, the roof, the ceiling of it, um, the walls of it, the floor of it, the coffer there, and then you have, um, what they call star chefs are air shafts that go out to a north and south. That's what robert has worked on in part. And then above the king's chamber, you have the so called relief chambers or relieving chambers, which you can't get into normally.

Speaker 2:          02:02:52       I've been in there a few times, uh, but you have to get special permission. they have to put a ladder up from the grand gallery and you go through this little snake hole, so to speak, um, to get up there. But there's these chambers above it which seemed to serve no function. That's why they're called relief chambers or relieving chambers because there was early speculation that somehow they help distribute the weight of the great pyramid, but engineering from an engineering point of view, they don't seem to work or it doesn't seem to make any difference. I mean the rest of the pyramid solid and other pyramids are solid and don't collapse without. Why do they copy these chamber and It's called the king's chamber. Basically the arabs called it that because their concept was, if I remember correctly, that men will have a chamber with a flat ceiling on it. The queens chamber, which is lower down in the, um, a pyramid has a inverted v shape change a ceiling to it and they thought that was for the queen. That would be female. The king's chamber would be for the male. It's also the more impressive chamber speculation. Purely speculation. Yeah. It's purely spec.

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       Now, the coffer, this giant stone box. One of the things that I read was that the way it was built, they believed that it was possible that cores were drilled out.

Speaker 2:          02:04:14       Yeah. Yeah. Probably the corn. And we have good evidence for that going back to earliest dynastic times of not earlier that they, um, I forget what you call it in modern times, but uh, you have a drill bit that is circular in shape and it drills out a core. So you know, they were drilling granite. You, again, if it's on display, I could show you in the egyptian museum in cairo, sarcophagi guy, which probably really worse or carf a guy or at these big granite boxes where they were signed the granite. In fact, not only were they saw you, it looks like they were using high speed saws because in some cases they would make a little mistake and then have to back off and then go at it again. You don't do that if you're, in my opinion, if you're doing it by hand, you know, back and forth with a, there's some sort of machinery involved.

Speaker 2:          02:05:09       There's some kind of machining they were using. And very ancient times. There's, once you open your eyes to it, you see it. Where you see it seems to be high speed machinery. There's no regulation as to how, oh, there's lots of speculation. I mean, some people say they had electric motors and electricity and all that type of thing. Some people. Yeah. Some people I don't go there because I want real evidence, so I see real evidence that they were doing things that seem really unbelievable from a standard status quo conventional point of view. Say that standard Egypt logical point of view of how cool, how primitive they were. Right. But I'm not into speculating in ordinarily as to, well what kind of technology they might have had. I just don't know at this point. Yeah. So there are images of the inside of the sarcophagus, like we could get a look at what that looks like.

Speaker 2:          02:06:06       Oh, it's not very impressive. I'm sure he can probably, I don't know if you can see the drill marks they have essentially. No. Um, but you know, they're there. You can see other places. So for instance, when we go into the valley temple next to it, there's one of the doors that was on huge hinges and I don't think you're going to find pictures of this on the internet because it's very hard to photograph a, but when you look at that in person, you can see how they drilled out, you know, the hinge several, several inches in diameter and did a core drill because you can still see, if I remember there, you can still see the sort of the stub where it broke off. Oh wow. Yeah. You can see how they were using sophisticated techniques to do this, but no idea whatsoever. But I don't know what cad.

Speaker 2:          02:06:58       Well, put it this way, if we, and this is. I'm not speculating that they had such things, but you can tell in modern times that someone used a power, saw a power drill or this type of tour, that type of tool. Thousands of years from now. You might be able to still see that in this table. Yeah. I'm like beyond interpreted, but you don't have a single example of the tool that was actually used for. Right, right. We know these guys. I sometimes almost find it silly when people say, well, here we go. No, this how could out there. That's a nice example of it. Okay. There we go. That's a good example. Yeah, that's actually probably the one I was just talking about us as a bore hole and you can see the, how it was spinning. You can see how they were cutting down quite a bit in each turn.

Speaker 2:          02:07:48       So, so, so I almost find it. I don't almost find. I do find it silly sometimes when people say to me the critics or skeptics, oh, you know, if they were doing all of this stuff will, where's examples of their tools? Let me. How many guys just leave, you know, they walk away from a site and they leave their buck toolbox. There are even our. Forget. I mean, all the, all the mechanics I've ever known and people like that, they're very careful to pick up every tool and put it back and make sure they've got all their equipment will go to the building and try to find a hammer. Right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No, that completely makes sense. But man, I would just like to know, like what were they doing and how did they make that whole. That's, that's a massive, massive mr right in front of everyone's face. Yeah, yeah, exactly. What's the standard eds egyptologists explanation.

Speaker 2:          02:08:46       They just really, they just shrug their shoulders all we see that all the time. Well, great. You see it all the time, but it reminds me of, um, this is maybe silly, but I'm going to say it any way. Uh, no, I don't know. Well, I'll say it anyway. A supposedly a analogy. You know, if you, if you're used to something, I'll put it this way. If you're used to seeing something on a regular basis, you start, you stop questioning. It just becomes, um, common to you, but you don't really question it. It's like technology today. How many people could explain how even the most rudimentary sense, how some of the technology works that we have today. The egyptologist seemed to. They just get immune to it. They see all this fabulous stuff and they just forget that will this was made somehow we don't really know how it was made.

Speaker 2:          02:09:40       Then they again go back to the simplistic explanations of, oh, you know, on some new kingdom or late period we have this illustration. This must be how they did it and I'm not convinced that that's always how they did it. Almost just to look a little cartoon. Right. Did they have any illustrators? They would have a drill and some stones around it as a wage to keep it spinning. No, I haven't seen that. Yeah. You might have had. Yeah. Yeah. I mean there's. So you think that's just purely speculation? Yeah. Or it could be sort of the equivalent modern cartoons of a, you know, simple explanation of how something works and a lot of that is really more to say, okay, if you're a watchmaker, I say 200 years ago, you're a watchmaker, you might have some sign that indicates you're a watchmaker, but don't try to take that sign is a blueprint of how you actually made watches.

Speaker 2:          02:10:39       Right, right. That makes sense. No, it does. It does. Um, so the, when they constructed that coffer, they somehow or another board, yeah, they probably board down maybe board in the quarters board down, broke out pieces, this a speculation now and broke it out. And then once you've got it roughed out, then polished the surfaces, that type of thing. Um, so you know, if you leave any traces of how it was actually constructed, that's not as good as if there are no trace. It's more or less, you know, it's not as good a job. You look at something like the statue of kafra or chef ron. This is credible statue and the egyptian museum, again, it's the one that has the face of the pharaoh that supposedly was the face of the sphinx, which they don't match up at all as the hawk control has a haka shoulders.

Speaker 2:          02:11:36       Uh, that statue is absolutely incredible. You know, it's so smoothly polished, etc. You have to look very hard to find a tool marks or evidence of how it was car because you know, a really good work and ship, you remove all that ultimately. So that's part of the problem with some of this really high quality egyptian work is that they would remove the traces. Yeah. There, there it is. Um, the, they would remove the traces of how it was made in that image. The thing on the side of it, you see that sort of plasma formation. Yes, absolutely. Because this ties in. This is why I brought image of this because it ties in with that whole scenario. Well, it has the circle said, well, exactly. Very observant. And think about the bird headed man, the hoc and this incredible statue. If you feel it face on, you don't see the bird from the side.

Speaker 2:          02:12:43       You see the bird. God, it's incredible. All of this stuff is so fascinating, so I think it really all goes back to this very early formative period. If you would this really important period for humanity and what was happening. There's a head on view and there you don't see the bird at all. Of course. Incredible. And tammy carve something like that today. I don't know what it would cost, who you could pay. I've heard, you know, this is anecdotal, but I've talked to his stone cutters and that type of thing and you know, to try to duplicate some of what they see in Egypt. I mean it just would take them so long and so much work and it would be so expensive with modern power

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       tools that they basically say, you know, who could do it?

Speaker 4:          02:13:36       Do you have any fear that this is going to? Disinformation is going to be lost. I mean that you're so far down this track of sort of explaining these things and these revolutionary theories about what happened and I don't. This is a, I been, I've been studying this for a long time and this is the first time I'm hearing it,

Speaker 3:          02:13:56       so that's why I need to be on your show. I'm so glad you're here to get this out into the public. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:14:01       You're so far down this road. Is there anyone else is doing the same kind of work? Does anybody else's with you on this?

Speaker 3:          02:14:08       Well, I think I'm the one that's doing this right now, but I think there are a lot of other pieces that tie in. So per dr parata work, but he served, been, you know, he had some health issues and other things. She's older. I'm the electric universe. There's what's known as the electric universe community, which ties in with this that a electrical phenomenon, plasma discharges are more important. There is a whole group now, um, that I think are starting to think about what if we had another carrington event in the new future, how would that affect our grid systems? So what I'm saying is I think there are a lot of little pieces that are starting to come together and you know, starting to come together, weaving this together, but what I'm trying to do right now, it's to paint the broad picture, the broad strokes and I think it goes back to the end of the last ice age and what was happening then, right up until now and what the implications are

Speaker 4:          02:15:10       and how is this being received. Are people picking up on that for picking

Speaker 3:          02:15:16       up on it and sometimes the, you know, people are picking up on it. When, how did they say it, the sincereness, was it copying someone or is this sincerest form of flattery, imitation that should imitation. And I do find and I'm kind of sometimes get a little annoyed. Yeah. People are starting to talk about a lot of these things, especially the plasma and the sun and solar events and all of a sudden by chance they're talking about it. Not necessarily mentioning me, but I think, you know, I know they tend to lecture or they maybe read my book. But yeah, these things take time and I'm not asking for a lot of, you know, everyone has to acknowledge me, uh, but I think it's important to get the information out and I think as we have things like your podcast and people read the books and I'm able to talk at conferences, we slowly get this out.

Speaker 3:          02:16:14       Well, you know, it takes time. It all takes time. Made me put it this way. Copernicus, and I'm not comparing myself to copernicus, but copernicus and the um, heliocentric view, now he publishes that on his death bed. That was a view that actually went back to, um, there were predecessors in ancient times, of course, but he published his on his death bed and um, you know, a couple generations later they're still persecuting galileo for supporting it. So these things, yeah, things go quicker now. Yeah. But it still takes some time. I see a big difference now, uh, than I do in the 19 nineties for even the reading of the sphinx, you see, is because of the internet. Uh, I think it's not just, yes, the internet helps. I have mixed feelings about the internet because the problem with the internet is you can disseminate information, you get information out, but it doesn't mean it's good information. So you get the naysayers, the critics, the skeptics, they have access to it, to fake news, fake news, and genuine

Speaker 2:          02:17:26       news versus real fake news. It seems that so many times they're flipped. They're very much. So it's very confusing. So one of the problems I see

Speaker 3:          02:17:36       with all this information and misinformation and all these factoids out there is, it's very confusing for many people if they're not involved in something. And again, I'm not trying to claim you have to go to experts and authorities because that's part of the problem too, when you have the pseudo authorities who just are pushing their own agendas and frankly don't know what they're talking about. And I see too many of that among we'll say certain academics and skeptics, that type of thing. Uh, but it's also confusing when you only take information and you don't know how put altogether. So I teach, you know, I teach in university, I teach college at boston university and what I find with students, and I'm not picking on them, I'm saying this with all due respect, they have so much access to facts and factoids, we'll use that term, but they have to understand the bigger picture. They have to be able to understand critically and think critically about it to put things together. Um, and how does it all fit together and that that's so important. And that's not something I think you get just from surfing the internet,

Speaker 2:          02:18:47       right? Of course. Quickly, no. Watching a couple of youtube videos by someone that's not necessarily reliable, that's a problem, right? How much misinformation that's been spread through youtube more. More than good information probably. I mean, we could put on some fake lab coats right now and just make some nonsense video views by not exactly. And see, I've had the problem too in my business, you know, what I'm talking about is that they say you can't please everyone all the time. But it seems like in some cases in my career, in this field, I've been able to displease every one because I'll come out with position. Sorry I'm losing my headset. I'll come out with position sometimes where I'm not pleasing my academic colleagues, but I'm not extreme enough for the. Should we say other sites either also like caught in the middle because I'm going by the evidence I actually have it.

Speaker 2:          02:19:44       It's not jiving with. So to speak. The foil hat brigade. Yeah. So what, how is that received by the people that mean there are those ancient aliens type folks that really want everything. They want everything to be ancient aliens. And I've been accused of how could I not accept this or that, you know, because they get really mad at me and they say nasty son. They'll even tell me, well, this supports what everything you've been saying. I don't care if it supports everything I've been saved. It's not real. It's not real evidence isn't there? It's not. It is fascinating. They do dig up these ancient structures and the machu picchu and all these different places were like, wow, these construction methods are really pretty impressive. Incredible. It was going on back then, but they always want to tie it to aliens. They always want to tie it to aliens, which I think is a.

Speaker 2:          02:20:32       I hate to use this term, but sure of a cop out. Yeah, it's a business. That's where it gets down to a lot of this is business. People want to sell their books. They want to sell in their conference. Just they were settled their dvds. They want to sell their youtube videos and in some cases they want to sell for money. In some cases they want to sell for promotion, self promotion, and they want to be famous. I told you I was accused of that back in the early nineties. Oh, I just doing this place. I want to be famous. No, I'm not that type of person, and people love those shows. Those ufo in ancient alien type shows and they love those conferences. They go to those conferences and they all just mentally masturbate together. Very bizarre. It's like they're all like, yeah, there's not, but I think it was exCiting, but I think it does fill a void for some people and one thing I'm trying to do is to fill that void with something real, something important.

Speaker 2:          02:21:33       Something thAt has evidence to back it up because there are a lot of the questions. There are a lot of mysteries and I will admit I've been on the ancient aliens show, but I've never proposed ancient aliens have never supported that. I've always been clear. People actually listened to me, but they asked me to be on in a number of other academics have to. Do they kick you out of context a little bit? Well, yeah, the context is not slippery, slippery, but the point is that there are real mystery to this day. Things that we don't really understand that you and I have been discussing about and there's so many more we could discuss, but those are real and so many people that I know that watched shows like that. When I talked to them and I'm talking academics who would never admit that they watch it, they watch it because they find it entertaining, number one, they don't quite say it this way,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       but I think it fills a void and it does raise issues that if they're perceptive, then they might become aware of and realize that these are real issues. No ancient aliens or some other easy answer is not the way to go, but they are real things that need to be looked into. So even when I speak at a conference like that, there are so many very intelligent people that are there besides the other, but you know they're different types of people. Sure. But I know many people, they'll have phds and stuff and they'll go to it for a serve between entertainment but also to get exposed to things they're not going to be exposed to by the standard academic community. You're not going to get exposed to a lot of this. These types of questions. If you just go to the standard closed academic conferences, they're going to be washed over.

Speaker 3:          02:23:21       So, you know, I'm part what on trying to do with oracle, the organization for the research of ancient cultures, which is not just me. I want to be clear on that. In fact, we, our president is a, uh, he, he's actually, I guess heavy metal guitar player. He's really berkeley trained. He's excellent. Yeah, no, I mean seriously, but he's, he's a really bright guy and he's fascinated by these things. We have people like jocelyn godwin from colgate university who's a world renowned scholar on the visory board. Uh, but what we're trying to do with things like oracle and I will encourage people to actually look at it because we've got a website up that you can go through my website, www.robertschoch.com to get there or um, go directly to us@www.oracle. Oh, there it is. there we go. Or coal online o r a, c u l online.

Speaker 3:          02:24:20       Oh, you know, all one word.org. And what we're trying to do with this and also through the institute for the study of the origins of civilization, iso, soc, which I'm trying to do at boston university, is to have a forum where we can look at these real topics, these topics, these topic seriously using evidence, but not all but also not be dismissive just because we have to uphold the standard dogma. So I don't want to go with just a nonsense, you know, flippant or easy out to sell someone's book that, you know, this crazy book or yeah, I'm not being nasty about anyone, um, or you know, just stick to the standard pair of time, but thinking out of the box, but as they say, but thinking out of the box, using real evidence and using real logic and using real rationality to look at a number of these issues, they're more resistance towards a redating

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       Egypt and Egypt technology, particularly ancient Egypt versus other cultures like go, go back, like tap a and some other ancient structures that they're finding a tap a. The Beauty of rebecca tap bay is that there's no cd attached to it. That's right. The dating of rebecca tap is the dating that is based on hard strategic rfi radiocarbon dates, german archeological institute, correct me if I'm wrong, it's because it was pr. It was purposely purposefully covered 10,000 plus years ago. And in that case, this ties back to our bigger picture. You have evidence, we have evidence of catastrophe at rebecca beckley tap bay. We have evidence that the pillars were knocked down and hastily re-erected. Um, and you can see that in the pillars they built these. There. We have a picture up there. If you can see the pillar on the far on the right side, that is not an archeological reconstruction.

Speaker 2:          02:26:23       That pillar was knocked down. It was put back into position, but you can see how it was put back into position crudely, using fragments of another pillar. Then they built these crude walls to serve. Hold the pillars up. They butted against it. Well, to me, this is happening and the dating confirms it in the aftermath of the initial solar outburst at the end of the last ice age when you had all this tumultuous, um, you know, things happening, uh, earthquakes. And this the precipitation, the rain, the fire coming down the thunder. So you have this incredible situation where we have captured at beckley tap bay the catastrophe that was going on and how they were trying to reconstruct it and I think, I don't want to say that gave up, but for whatever reason that was probably just so much. They ended up covering the whole thing artificially. Maybe to preserve it.

Speaker 2:          02:27:19       Maybe they intended to go back to it maybe for posterity. I don't know what their thinking was. We could speculate about that, but tying in with what you were just asking, beckley tap bay is not tied to some other later civilization as is dynastic Egypt. So there's a lot of dogma involved. correct. It's a dogma there is involved. How sophisticated is is good. BeckleY tap a and you know those that want to uphold the standard story saying, well yeah, it's pretty, but it's not that sophisticated, dismissive data as hunter gatherers. Yeah. They called hunter gatherers and they say, oh, hunter gatherers are thereby primitive, and therefore they, you know, they just try to wave their arms and say it served like saying it's a normally but not much of a nominally, so we don't need to really worry about, but they've only correct me if I'm wrong, they've only uncovered as very small fragment of it.

Speaker 2:          02:28:19       Yeah, very, very small. This is an enormous structure structure and in that picture that's up. We'll describe it for those that don't see the picture, but there's pictures like this in my book, forgotten civilization. In fact, I think that's right out of my book, probably are very similar to what you can see the pillar in the back on the left. Do you see how that was knocked down and it's propped up and it is been put back into position. Then they built these crude walls against it before they buried the whole thing. So this whole site underwent dramatic catastrophe was being put together quickly again. And then the animals as well. There's, yeah, there's one right there. It's beautiful. The serve, I call it a fee line, sir. Feline going down and theY had a carved the stone around that, so much more complicated, much more complicated.

Speaker 2:          02:29:15       And when they were, when they were carving these originally, taking them out of the quarry to get, say a 15 ton pillar, I think we're looking. Oh, there we are there. It's so beautiful. I love that. Now, if you saw that in a museum of modern art, it could fit right in. Uh, uh, two points I just wanted to make before I forget them. One, when you're carving these pillars to get 10 or 15 ton pillar like that finalized, you have to cover a much bigger chunk of rock initially because of course you have to leave the rock where you're going to have the animal. You have to leave the rock because they're not in sizing these in. They're carving them and relief. So that's a lot more complicated kind of way. All the rock, etc. so this is an incredible technological feat. Also off the record.

Speaker 2:          02:30:04       And this one, if you look at that one, do you see how it's got weather, pig pigs and whatnot, but you also see the weathered surface. I'm going to teach you a little geology that is a older pillar that was being reused at the end of the last ice age, I believe, so some of these structures actually go back earlier and before klaus schmidt passed away unexpectedly. He was talking about this too, that even there they were maybe you reusing some structures that were a little bit earlier or maybe several thousand years earlIer, so this goes back. The origins of get back late. Teppei may go back thousands of years earlier when all said and done, once we get the evidence in a well into the end of the last ice age, I'm stuffed out about 9,700 bc. I was going to say before I forget it a lot going on here, off the record, of course they would never admit to this, but off the record, I've spoken to archaeologists when they're in a giddy mood and and, and asked them, well, if you just found, say that animal on the glabella tip a pillar in isolation or you just found one of these pillars are part of one in isolation.

Speaker 2:          02:31:21       You were just looking at how do you think it would be, and I've heard the answer 600 bc, a thousand bc based on the technology, you know, the technological finesse, the beauty of the carving, not eight, 9,000 years earlier, right? Yeah. But they would never say that on the record. Right, right, right. Yeah. Because it's so complicated to monkey. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then. But I've had them say that, well if I, they just found, say that little feline type thing on the side of the pillar just broken off and just an isolation, they'd probably say one told me, yeah. Oh maybe it's a thousand bc at most, right. Most but not 9,000, 700 bc or whatever. That's crazy. Now are, have they Identified the quarries? Were these stones? Yeah, some of them happen and they're not super far away as a kilometer or a bit more.

Speaker 2:          02:32:15       I mean it's, there's limestone around there, so it's not a situation as you have in Peru for instance, where they're dragging this stuff, you know, tens of kilometers away. but I don't think that detracts from. No, no, no. What they were doing it sort of, yeah, it's still crazy and um, you know, it's easy for me to say this, but once you've quarried a block, if you're moving a kilometer, it's not that much harder to move it 10 kilometers, it just takes more effort. But the same technology, it's really korean. Be able to move it to begin with and then be able to carve it into these beautiful structures. And something I want to point out too is that a lot of times when I talk about Rebecca Lee bay, I'll make the comment about stone henge because people are familiar with stonehenge. Stonehenge, when you look at the blocks, they're, they're so much cruder than what we have at beckley tap bay and the tap pay stone pillars.

Speaker 2:          02:33:13       The central ones particularly, they are so beautifully carved, but if you look at them, they're also very, very thin and their smallest dimension there you can see it how thin it is and that one's anthropomorphic with the belt and the hands. And that sure looks like a, some people would say a metal buckle on it. So that's very similar to like those easter island Is very similar to easter island there. I think there are definite connections there, but why shouldn't there be. We were just talking about rango rango in ours to ago and how they were seen similar things in the sky, but I wanted to point out that when you carve a pillar like that that's so thin and narrow, that's much more difficult to keep it from snapping to keep it from breaking. Also, if you see in that pillar how it's said into the bedrock, it's said in just literally very, very shallow.

Speaker 2:          02:34:11       I'm the set into the bedrock. Klaus schmidt commented to me that, and he published this too, that they seem to be using some kind of concrete or cement to help set them into the bedrock, which is untold up at such an early period when he fIrst was excavating them before he got down to the bottom. I think he said this to me verbally. He estimated that about a third, at least a third of the pillars should be set into the bedrock. Just to hold it up, prop it up, not just on the order of centimeters as you find. Is this a sturdy construction like a, was it? No, no. You can't touch it now. They won't touch it and it probably would fall over. They have to do all kinds of supports on it. Now. My suspicion is that initially it was not roofed over there, that they were free standing pillars and they were very, very carefully set and balanced and everythIng was in perfect order.

Speaker 2:          02:35:12       This is total speculation, but like many of the habilis and whatnot, they may have even had a vibration to them. They may have purposefully vibrator picked up some kind of frequency. You can see the. Yeah, how shallow it is, but they were finely tuned, whatever you want call that, and I'm not trying to claim it. Some kind of weird machine or some people have called speculated, but I think there was something there and resonance. An audio cues. Audio frequencies are historically very important in both modern structures. Usually you think of as religious, but you know, it affects your mental thinking and abilities and that type of thing. So something may have been going on there with that. This may also be why they broke so easily during the catastrophe. I shouldn't say easily. It was a huge catastrophe. Um, but they were trying to redirect them.

Speaker 2:          02:36:11       What is the timeline in terms of like the total uncovering that site? Oh, in modern times. I mean, no, what are they trying to do? Like how much time do you think it's going to take for them to completely uncover? Oh, if they do it carefully, century century. Oh, could be. It's a huge site. And, and klaus schmidt when katie and I were there, um, I think he waved his arms and he talked about how there's all these other hills out there that probably have more under them. I mean, you're talking a huge complex and we know that in some cases because you see little fragments sticking up and that type of thing. And also remember when you're doing archeology and I have training in archaeology despite what some of my critics would say. When you're doing archeology, it's inherently destructive because you can't put it back together. So if you don't do it carefully, you don't do it right. You're destroying evidence. You are inherently destroying evidence. So a lot of people nowadays, professionals, they don't want to excavate the entire site at one time. They want leave

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       parts on, excavate it so that other people have a go at it. As you develop new technology, you can apply that to a different part of the site, plus practical things. This is in Turkey, it's close to the syrian border. Um, and we know how the political situation there is with this l'amec state, etc. They would love to destroy this site. I'm sure. Really, it's very close to earth, uh, which is the city of abraham. It's a very sacred holy site, um, for judaism, christianity. But more than anything else, islam get beckley. Teppei is just outside psychic power drive by taxi. I'm from earth in earth. Uh, you have the, um, sacred cave of abraham. You have the pools of abraham, you have big mosque there. And I bring this all up because this is a very ancient city when they excavate in earth, uh, not archeological excavations, but say they build a new road or they do build a new underground garage, they often hit 12,000 year old or there abouts remains.

Speaker 3:          02:38:31       So there's this beautiful statue called earth, a man, which is now in the museum and five, which also has just lots of artifacts from beckley tap bay. And it was found right near the, um, modern pools of abraham when they were doing some construction project, but it represents an image of the people supposedly are at least it's an image of a man or person that gates back to go back 10 times. It's about full sites. It's about the same size as me, but lucky legs very similar actually has a lot of comparisons to the moai on easter island. Got a picture of this. I think we do. I think we do. Is that beautiful? Wow. Look, he's staring at you with obsidian eyes and he is from beckley tech time, but he was found in earth. Uh, and you're not going to do it. We're not going to do it, but if you could just wipe out the modern city and excavate there, who knows what you would find potentially erf.

Speaker 3:          02:39:35       Uh, uh, this is me speaking as one of the oldest inhabited cities on earth. I'm going back to the late ice age. Well, this is something that goes on in Mexico city as well, right? Yeah, sure. Building apartment building, all kinds of things on an aztec temple and, and, and in cairo and other parts of Egypt. There were families that lived for centuries because their little huts or the community was on the top of ancient ruins and they would dig in their basement and pull out a gold statuette or whatever, sell it and you know, eat for the six months. So

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       is this earth a place? Is there any consideration to like picking isolated spots and starting to dig in? I think there's some consideration on the part of archeologist and turkish government, that type of thing, but you've also got a very strong religious elements you mentioned placed into all of this. Of course. And also, you don't necessarily want to destroy a, uh, ancient islamic temple, say islamic mosque, a mosque that goes back to, I don't know, I'm just making this up. Eight hundred 80 or something to excavate something that's a few thousand years old, a thousand years older or 10,000 years old or more, I mean, yeah. Again, on the one hand, which am I more interested, it might be one versus the other, but other people are interested in the other car. I mean there's all these factors that play into it. So it gets very complicated, very messy.

Speaker 2:          02:41:10       And then of course You have this situation and this ties in where, you know, I know christians are more interested in the birth of jesus and where the mangers and we can see in Egypt of one's interested to suppose that place where the holy family stayed when jesus went to Egypt, you know, whatever. Um, and you can see things like that in earth, uh, for abraham and whatnot. And how do you respect that with. But also why excavate underneath. And then some people would say excavating underneath is sacrilegious to, you know, what their main interest is, you know, so it gets very, very complicated. I've met phds in Egypt, uh, one in particular. Just to tell you a quick anecdote, I'm sitting there having breakfast. This was in the 19 nineties and um, it was in a hotel where it's overlooking the pyramid and sphinx.

Speaker 2:          02:42:06       I'm looking at them, nice. Having a nice breakfast. That guy comes down and sits with me, joins with may, start making conversation. Turns out he said, I'm cairo university, you know, economics. I think he's a professor of economics or whatnot. And he starts telling me because it's obvious I'm not a chip shit, why am I there? I'm staying the pyramids. And then he starts telling me his opinion of all this was opinion, was that the pyramid should be dismantled. Get rid of this finks don't need any of that. Used those raw materials on site to build a cupboard over air condition shopping mall bigger than the one in dubai. And that would really benefit Egypt economically and otherwise. Who said this? He was a professor at our university. I might not know his name, but I have no question. He was genuine and real and I didn't or anything

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       because it was serious, but where's he coming from? Impart Egypt. Didn't mean anything to him. Dynastic egyptians. Lot of egyptians do. It means something to them, but there's a lot of egyptians in Egypt. They're muslim. If it's pre muslim, it's not a big deal. If it's pre arab, it's not a big deal because they're arabs. They might've been in Egypt for over a thousand years, but the native egyptians is not their culture. Culture. Wow. Well, but it's not. Think about America, how many native native american mounds and raves and whatnot get bulldozed over with that. Maybe the most preliminary archeological salvage to build a shopping mall or a neW development. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. We think it's really crazy when someone like that would say that about the pyramids and sphinx, you know, because everyone knows about them, but from his perspective, if I quizzed him, he could have turned around and said, well, look what you do in your country.

Speaker 3:          02:44:19       Well, it's almost human nature across the planet when they're inconsiderate to do something along those lines. So my point is not really to criticise him. He had very different perspective. Um, it's, I don't agree with that perspective, but I could understand where he was coming from. He wasn't coming, he wasn't some crate, he didn't strike me as some crazy fundamentalists or anything like that. He was just thinking in different terms and for him, and he's not the only one I've spoken to in Egypt. Egyptians a who'd take that perspective now. Others will say we have to save all these, but not necessarily because they could care less about pyramids and sphinxes and tombs, but because they're good for the economy because it brings in tourism. But then there's the counter argument which I've heard many times that Egypt has to separate itself from tourism. So you need to cut off the nipple.

Speaker 3:          02:45:18       Yes, because I've had egyptian say to me in no uncertain terms, and I'm not joking or anything but pointed out that depending on how you count it, you know, 25 percent to 60 percent or more of the egyptian economy could be based on tourism because it's not just the direct tourism, but it's those that supply the people who deal with the tourists, et cetera, et cetera, and when you have a situation that you have something happen in the middle east could be far from Egypt, but people get excited, you know, americans all of a sudden tell me, oh, I can't go to Egypt. That's my interest to go to Egypt because something happened in Syria. That's what I heard and it has nothing to do. No, but I think if our country and our economy was dependent upon tourism solely, not solely, but portion of

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       it was tourism and then something happens in Brazil and all of a sudden because something happened in Brazil, no tourists are coming to America and it cripples our economy. I mean, I can Understand that perspective dog and completely understand their perspective. What is the perspective in Turkey when they're dealing with go beckley? Tempe and the. Well, I think it's a mixed too. I mean, I think they're in Turkey, unfortunately from my perspective, you've got more and more rise of should we say radical islamic fundamentalism that doesn't really worry about such things, but you also have people who seek of beckley tap a as potentially someday vine with the sphinx and pyramids for tourist dollars and for a destination. I mean turkeys. Wonderful. My opinion, I love both Turkey and Egypt. Just to visit them, to travel through them, that type of thing. Within the country you have to know what you're doing by people travel with me, I know what I'm doing.

Speaker 2:          02:47:07       I don't mean that nasty way. I know and I will not take risks. I'll take risks for myself and I've, as I say, been on the wrong end of a garden center. Yeah. But happened. Oh, the worst was Pakistan, but that's what we do in Pakistan. I was collecting fossils. This is when I was a graduate student and at one point, um, I was accused of carrying plastic, plastic explosives and all of a sudden had for um, ak 47 point myself. Not point. I felt that. Yeah, they were touching it and I know enough about small arms. These were loaded in the cocktail. I mean their fingers were on the triggers, not on the trigger guards. Yeah. Yeah. It turns out I didn't have plastic explosives and you know, I'm a mild mannered guy and I said, you go whatever you want to. I didn't do anything wrong and I explained and I was carrying back then a little bricks, little things of a oil based clay that I guess have the texture and feel of some of the explosives they would use.

Speaker 2:          02:48:16       We would use these when we collected fossils and you find a bunch of fragments to prop it up and put it into position as you glued them together. But explaining that. Yeah, yeah. I had to explain all of that. And um, someone came from the Pakistan geological survey. Explain that. Yeah. I really was who I was, but you know, it's a situation where people get excited and that was back in the battle days of, you know, well I don't know if it seemed better in Pakistan now, but you know, they're tough situations, but if you know how to behave and you know, how deal with it, you know how to avoid it, you'll be okay. And uh, right now I would say Egypt is very, very safe. It really is. People have all kinds of misconceptions about Egypt. Turkey, we were starting to talk about Turkey. Turkey may be going the other route a little bit.

Speaker 2:          02:49:10       I'm being very honest. Uh, but I have no problem going with Turkey and I have no problem taking people to Turkey, but at this point there are certain areas I might avoid just to be on the safest, safest, a little more slippery. Yeah. But I would never endanger anyone else. In fact, I always err on the side of safety when it comes to anyone. One else. I'm not that I want to take great risks with myself either. But you know, sometimes as a geologist and I read that I have, I feel I have to do what I

Speaker 4:          02:49:43       do. Do you have any plans on releasing this theory of coronal mass ejections and all the things that we've talked about today into something like a documentary?

Speaker 2:          02:49:52       something that I might be a little bit more. I would love to do a documentary. Something that john, Anthony West and I, we're often talking about documentary. We also would like to do a film, a full length feature film if we could get back in and whatnot. serve a, how should I say it? Semi popularized a semi fictionalized, but always based on real science, real data, real evidence. So yeah, I've seen so many films where they're about geological catastrophes, whether it's huge asteroid city know or you know, san andreas fault and they're so faked. Yeah. But because it's not real, what really happened, it's not really what happened and what I'm saying is what has happened in the past and what really will happen in the future if we get hit again, which I hate to say this, but from a geological perspective, there is no doubt these things are unavoidable.

Speaker 2:          02:50:49       It would be like saying we'll never have another volcanic eruption or earthquake again. Of course we will. Of course we will. So it's better to be aware of it and prepare for it. So yeah, I'd love to do. I'm a good film and this film would be something that would really catch on. Well, if you could help us. Well, I'll connect you to people. Maybe that would be excellent. I'm serious. I'm serious. This is something that katie and I, katie, for those that just tuned in, katie's my wife and uh, I think you heard when we were talking to me for, she has some background in um, you know, she was a dancer and entertainment and broadway, but film connections. We really need to connect with them,

Speaker 4:          02:51:29       put it out there for contact information if someone is in that. If someone like

Speaker 2:          02:51:33       to take hold of you, absolutely. The best way to get ahold of me would be through my website, www dot robert schoch, s c h o c h is how the last name is spelled.com. Or if they want to email me directly, and this is on the website whole with this thing you're given. I know. Why should I give out the email to the contact page that my wife is to my left there. And she said the contact page. Nailed it. Um, she said the contact page. Did I say too much? No, no, no, you're good. Okay. Um, so if people go to www.robertschoch.com and then go to the contact page, they'll get my contact information there. I think we have a fairly direct way to contact me. I fall, so I believe got my business address, their boston university address office because I really am at boston university, full time tenured faculty member. And, uh, I'm interested if people want to contact me about film, if they want go to each with me. I do tours periodically. I'll arrange something if people have enough, you know, if they want a private, if they have enough people that would want come to make it viable or yeah, these things cost money. If I were independently wealthy, maybe I just take people for fun at my expense, but I just, I don't have that.

Speaker 1:          02:52:54       Well, I built a to you. You Have stimulated a lot of people's imagination. And I mentioned one more please

Speaker 2:          02:53:00       chamber that chamber under the pod, the sphinx for a quarter century. Now. I want to continue the serious research on that. I have Contacts in Egypt. I've talked to the ministry of antiquities, the um, uh, actually director, I guess he is of The grand egyptian museum, the new museum. I think we could make inroads there to actually explore that if someone has money or interest in that. The problem is, and I want to say is bluntly, a lot of people say, oh, well why don't you just raise money by crowdfundinG doesn't work for Egypt. You have to have the money upfront, they don't want, you know, crowd funding type money. So that's another thing. So my point is that there's film project love to pursue, there's research, love to pursue. That's why we've set up the oracle, the not for profit to do this. Alright. And legitimately that's why I'm saying the institute at bu institute for the study of the origins of civilization. So lots of possibilities and I'm hoping we can make some of this happened.

Speaker 1:          02:54:05       I'm hoping we tend to uh, really appreciate you being here man. It was really awesome to talk to you and you blew my mind this, this whole theories. It scares the shit out of me, but it also, it's very exciting. Well thank you. Thank you. And again, I'm not trying to scare anyone

Speaker 2:          02:54:19       but I think we have to be real and we have to be realistic and there's no point in hiding and you know, closing your eyes to.

Speaker 1:          02:54:26       And it's just an awesome theory. I mean it's just, it's very cool. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Gentlemen.
