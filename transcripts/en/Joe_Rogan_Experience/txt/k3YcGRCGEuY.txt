Speaker 1:          00:00:03       In four, three, two, one. Hey Jimmy. What's up? Hi Joe. How you doing? Doing good now we're on the radio. Fantastic. It's 3:31 minutes before 4:00. Here's vow with the weather. Hot. Hottest. Fuck back to you Jimmy. Bob. So how are we going to car fire in the breakdown lane. So you were getting emotional in the green room listening to Henry rollins talk about Putin. You're about to quote Chomsky like. Yes. So he was, I just caught the end of it. I sent, went in the green room and I like, you know, everybody loves Henry Rollins. Right? And Sam Henry twice. So good. He's constantly grinding. Yeah. But he was doing that thing about. Oh, poot. And you know there was a journalist who wrote a book about them, ended up dead. Putin's a bad guy. He's a bad guy as opposed to who? Well, no, but he, you, you mean he's definitely a bad guy, right?

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       We all agree that course. But I mean just because other people are also bad guys. It doesn't negate his point of Putin being a bad guy. What he was saying is just that. It's very bizarre that the Republicans, these people that were at the forefront of the Cold War, these ones always, I mean these are the people that remember Khrushchev Banging on the desk saying, we'll bury you with, with Kennedy and these people are now like the whitewashing Putin. They're essentially like trying to paint out Putin to be a good guy because trump is in this position where he's trying to be friends with this guy. So.

Speaker 1:          00:01:37       Well here's the quote I wanted to send you. Right? So that whole thing, if, if Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post war American president would have been hanged since says Noam Chomsky, a Putin kills journalists. We just torture hours. Let me. Chelsea manning is a whistleblower. We took Brock Obama torture. So we have our president, we have presidents and vice presidents who are legit war criminals that walk around today, that a torture program. Okay. So, uh, you know, Barack Obama got a peace prize and then he had a kill list. How a peace prize winner with a kill list at drone kill it. Would you keep the kill list next to the peace prize? Where do you keep those two things? Are they anyway, so that's some of the people that were killed were American citizens with no due process, no due process. And so nobody has a problem with trump. Being buddy buddies with Benjamin Netanyahu is a psychopathic maniac who shoots, who shoots with precision, uh, medics who are trying to help people in nurses hand journalists, by the way. Well, some is really true. Israeli troops do that. That's a really depressing thing. You know, I had abby Martin on and she sort of illuminated that whole situation to me. I really didn't know how bad it was, nor did she until she went over there. Right. And you know, just experiencing what it's like the, it's crazy that people that went through the

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       Holocaust that realize the cost of dehumanizing an entire race of people now are capable, at least some of them are capable of doing that to the Palestinians.

Speaker 3:          00:03:10       Yeah. It's, it's, it's kind of mind blowing. So I want to hear, and I have friends who do that. Everyone's doing this right? Everyone's getting caught up in this hysteria. That's why there's a word called hysteria because it happens and Lauryn one, and you know what I like is what Noam Chomsky said about this Russia hysteria that's happening. He said, if you care about effects on our pristine elections, which he said very sarcastically, he said, if you care about what's affecting our pristine elections to Russia, gate is the last place I would look, and the first place he would look. If you're worried about four and a control of or influence on our government. He said he would look to Israel. They're the ones. Benjamin Netanyahu came here and address the joint session of Congress without the permission or invitation of the president, my bro, when Obama was president and he did that.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       He did that. That's a guy coming here to tell our guys how to vote in direct defiance of our president and everyone embraced him. Can you imagine the food and did that boot and came to America and addressed the joint session of Congress against the will of the president. So this idea that somehow because Putin is a bad guy, trump shouldn't have a good friendship with them. Is Bs the guys who are really influencing our government. Here are Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia, but trump opened eight businesses in Saudi Arabia during the election. No one gives a crap about any of that stuff because they're our friends. Saudi Arabia, by the way, just bombed us school today. A school bus, 29 kids dead. So yeah, I just retweeted that from Sarah Abdula. So, uh, why would they do that? Because they're in Yemen. They're, they're, they're bombing. We were committing genocide in Yemen right now.

Speaker 3:          00:04:41       So we're helping Saudi Arabia committed genocide in Yemen. And the way we're doing it is they're doing a thing called siege warfare, which is a war crime. And we just, in fact they just prosecuted someone a few months ago in a, at the Hague for it. So, but since we're doing it and we're the enforcers and Saudi Arabia is on the human rights council. So everything's a joke now, right? So we were past it where it's a farce. We're living in this forest. And so when I see a guy that I love, like Henry Rollins, I'm saying stuff like, oh Putin's this special, kind of bad. I just called back Chomsky out. We have nothing. We have legit war criminals. Just one presidency away.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       Do you think he's a step removed from that though? I mean he, he'll assassinate journalists in his own

Speaker 3:          00:05:24       country right now. Right now we're trying to assassinate Julian assange right now are trying to do. They're trying to kill that guy. Yes. They want at that guy dead heavily. Hillary Clinton's campaign. We drone that guy, can't we kill them? And she really did say that. She really did say that after she just got done killing Kadafi and then laughed about it, that we've played that several times we came, we saw he died. The fact that fact

Speaker 2:          00:05:50       that any human being would ever do that, that. And by the way, the way he died, that's some dark shit they watched and they stabbed him in the ass hole. There's a video of him stabbing him in the asshole. I standing there just confused. Not knowing what to do in this guys jamming a sword up his ass. Have you seen the video? I have not seen. Oh my God, it's awful. You want to see, you know, the video, them capturing him is fascinating because it's a guy who has lived with an iron fist, controlled these people. Been a brutal dictator. Been a horrible monster of a human being. Now all of a sudden these rebels have captured him and they can't believe they have. I mean, they're shooting and stabbing him. And then eventually they have his body and they prayed his body around after they've killed them. But there's, there's, there's video of him should look at it for just for a moment because it's so stunning to see him captured and alive and can't believe that these rebels have him. That it's not even. It's not even like,

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       yeah, I have seen video of him captured and that look on his face. So I know what you're talking about. Just the guy's shoving. But I did not. I shoving a knife up his ass. I um, I hit a dog with my car awhile ago and I just can't have no stomach for any of that stuff anymore. I just a, I don't, something went, ha ha. I had a real breakdown. Like we took it to the vet. It lived. I didn't hit, I didn't. So I hit it. I hit a dog, killed it a bout a year and a half ago. He might have already been dead already been done because I think it was laying in the street because I didn't see it. So it had to be already laying there anyways, so it, you know, I just. And then I saw I was driving to my pot store and Eagle Rock and I saw this little black puppy dog run across the street in front of our car and there was this big median, like a grass median and it was good and I go, stop, stop.

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       And the cards hasn't started coming it the other way and I stopped saying my wife stops and I jumped out and I'm running and I see the cars coming and they're just, I don't see the dog anymore. And then I see the dog next to the curb and it's Kinda like, just going like that and it just crushed me. He's like, even now to think of it switching. Yes, it got hit. And so, um, we, we pick it up and we, we drove to a hospital as soon as we could. I mean, you know, the Animal Hospital, which there was one not far away and it lived, the dog lived, but I couldn't believe it. You take it as a pet. No, no, no, no. Um, um, they just might. My wife called back, you know, to the thing and they said, yeah, it's going to live in.

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       We have someone who's going to take it like, okay, thank God. But I was so surprised at how I just broke down over that puppy. The dog I ran over, I was like numb to but that dog for some reason that just everything opened and I was just, I couldn't, it was such a basket case puppy's so cute. It was such, I was hit by a car at such a how can. So it's just like, I see and I, and I feel like I don't know if I have this, but I feel like I have ptsd over that, right. Like I way over reacted to that situation so there was a lot more going on there. And so when someone says something like the Kadafi video. Yeah. So I can't even imagine guys who have to go to war and the stuff they have to see and the things that they have to do. I don't know how they all don't come. You know, anybody who went over there. Yeah, I, I've been, I've been to Afghanistan soldiers. I mean, but uh, uh, yeah. I mean I'd known that. Not Personally, like they come to my show, that kind of stuff. I know those people. I don't have a close friend who was actually in combat like that. No.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       I have a few close friends that have been in combat and when they start drinking and that's when, you know, inhibitions get loosened up and then stories start flowing and you know, it's most people, but it's not something people are designed to see, you know, especially not when. No one else is seeing it. The thing is if we all lived in the Roman times and everybody was getting sorted up every day and people getting hit with arrows all the time, it's a normal part of life when people start accepting the fact that there's going to be lost, but there's something about living today where the majority of human beings live in this uber safe environment that's probably a safe more safe than any people who've ever lived ever. And just overall in general, like the modern Western civilization. But then you're going over to Afghanistan and you're, you're, you know, you're dealing with bombings and schools and buses and sniper attacks and you know, your buddy just lost a leg from an ied and you know, that that kind of shit just wears on a person.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       Yeah. Just any, any, anything? I. Oh, I can't, I can't believe we still do more like this. It's just, you know, I'm very. See I get it a lot of trouble because I've antiwar and all words are bullshit and get in trouble because you're antiwar. For instance, pro war, uh, the entire establishment is pro war. You know that every, every newscaster is pro war. If you're on, if you're not pro war, you don't get on TV. If you're against the war, you get fired. Like Phil Donahue, like Ed Schultz, like Jesse Ventura, like Ashley Banfield, fear. If you tell Chris Hedges, if you tell the truth about the war, you will get fired from establishment news

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       establishment and use that will let you talk openly other than Artie. Artie seems to be pretty open, which is really ironic. It's ironic, right? Yeah. I mean, when Abby Martin was working for, it was like Jesus Christ, like, wow, how's that work?

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       No. At the empire files and you're working for Russia. I know. It does seem crazy. It's a crazy, crazy juxtaposition. It is weird. Ed Schultz was the one who said that, uh, you know, he wasn't. He was told what to cover, what not to cover at MSNBC. He was told not to cover Bernie Sanders. He wanted to cover Bernie Sanders. Anyway, he said that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the head of NBC News, Andy Lack. We're joined at the hip and he tried to cover Bernie Sanders. He was told not to, he was yelled at by the head of MSNBC, how he described it, and a month later he was fired. He was out. Well, Jack had a similar situation, Jack from the young Turks, just that he was told that, uh, our friends in Washington don't like your tone. Oh my God, that's what they told him. That is hilarious. And he was winning his time slot and they told them that and they moved into the weekend to give out sharp.

Speaker 3:          00:12:15       This is true, this is true. So they moved them to the weekend and they said they wanted him to work on his presentation skills. Guys. Wedding is time. Plot their segment. We want you to work on your presentation skills. And meanwhile who they replaced them with Al Sharpton. He's got great presentation skills. That's all. Al Has sued on Al Sharp. Did you ever see him try to read a teleprompter is brutal. Yeah. I mean he's a great order, but he's not a teleprompter reader and it was like I have clips we used to make fun of all the time on my show. If curious and then find out that that's the reason they gave was because he's a better presenter. He's better. He's a great order. That's different than being a news presenter and that is not in Al Sharpton's wheelhouse. No, it's just he's not the most trustworthy person either.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       I mean he's got a history of deception. So you having that, the way he got that job? Yeah. Well how about the way he became famous, the Tawana Brawley case. I mean he became famous through deception and so you're seeing this guy who is basically a famous con man who's now on television on a news program. Well, they have. There's a lot. Look at Brian Williams. Yes, yes. He has the 11th hour at an MSNBC, so since everybody forgotten, everybody has forgotten. I got. His punishment was he had to. He had to go spend six months a giggling with Rachel maddow. What did he do? Something show. They do these shows. They have like these round tables. At the end he has to laugh and pretend they all pretend they fucked up about him. All he had to do is tell the truth and I was scary enough.

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       No Shit. I mean, you were in Iraq. He really were there. Were there? Yeah. I mean, you really were there. Or Afghanistan. Was it Iraq or Afghanistan? I think it was a wreck. And you're really. Shots were fired. Hillary did the same goddamn thing. Oh, that's right. She lied about being shot at fucking straight up. Lied about being in Bosnia. Right. And, and who was it? The was the comedian who outed her. It was a sinbad. Sinbad who was on that trip and he's like sniper. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. She was busted straight up, lying about being shot at. So it's just, it's always shocking to me when I find out it had. Politicians are lying. Isn't it so true? They're all dark. That's weird. It's, it's such a. only the purest of people are drawn to that, but freshman, it's whenever I find out they're narcissists.

Speaker 3:          00:14:42       Megaliters, narcissistic megalomaniacs. I'm always shocked. You know what it is, Jimmy? We're weeding out the bad apples and then we're eventually gonna get to the good ones. Yeah. We got to get rid of these bad ones first. So that's why it comes back to when he was talking about how Putin, he is like, Hey, I want to tell trump, slow down. Don't be friends with this guy. No, I want trump to be friends with Putin because he's a nuclear power. I want trump to be friends with anybody. We need detente. NATO is the one wrapping up tensions, ramping up tensions with Russia and we have ever since the Cold War, it supposedly ended and so it was just a few anyways. So I just think, yes, Putin has a bad guy. They're all bad guys. Right? There's why I, you know, I just had John Kiriakou on my show. I don't know, is he?

Speaker 3:          00:15:21       So he is a FCA guy. He went to prison because he exposed the torture program. Oh yeah. So Robert Mueller actually prosecuted that guy. So now he's, he's a member of veterans intelligence professionals for sanity, Vips. And they were, uh, they were invented or they were originally organized to debunk the weapons of mass destruction about Iraq. So they were intelligence professionals who knew what was happening that we're being sold a bill of goods because the military industrial complex wanted it's war. Right. And so they, they were like all the top guys, ray mcgovern, Bill Binney, and they, and they created this organization to help debunk. It will open. He is the guy who was the first whistle blower for the NSF. Correct. And they tried to throw in the FBI, tried to throw him in jail. And of course he's the smartest guy at the NSA of her head.

Speaker 3:          00:16:09       So he outsmarted the FBI. Well how did they do that? So he had the story, but I forget the story, he told it to me, but he had them secretly recorded saying certain things. And so when they tried to show the evidence against him, he was like, actually I got you guys. And they're like, oh shit. And so they could. So he had him. So he outsmarted them and he tells the story on my show and you know, it was about a year ago, so I don't remember exactly how it went. But he told me a lot of mindblowing stuff on my show, a lot of stuff just to, um, you know, like about how they spy on us. Well, he was the one that first expose this program that was essentially spying on every single email, every single voicemail, every single conversation that you have is being recorded.

Speaker 3:          00:16:49       So William Binney invented a thing called thin thread. So thin thread was a data collection. So what he did is he hooked up every cell phone to every cell phone in the, in the universe. It's, and he did it and it was hard to do and everybody said you couldn't do it. He did it. And so he knew that medidata. What was more predictive than say, if I tap your phone and listen to your actual phone conversation, that I actually learned more by looking at a larger data set. And when, when, when context start happening, that means movements happening. That means that attack is going to happen. That means more so if the metadata means more. And so he found a way to attract people and keep your identity secret. So it was constitutional. That's what he cared about, the constitution and the right to privacy and thin thread did that it was a better and, and they got rid of thin thread and a couple of weeks later, nine slash 11 happened.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       So that's what built. So that's who bill binney is. And so he said they got rid of it because there's billions of dollars in the do pro. They brought in a, a, uh, I think it was called trailblazer out and not as good as a tracker, not as good as a metadata thing and, but it was five, $6,000,000,000 to Booz Allen or whoever invented it. And that's what it's all about is it's all about money and you don't want to disappoint people who want to have a lot of money paid their way. And then. So that's what. So he blew the whistle on that and they come back at them and they tried to put him in jail. That's what they do to whistleblowers. That's what we do. So that's funny to hear him say, oh, somebody wrote a bad book about Putin and they ended up dead.

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       What do you think we do in this country? Look what they did to Chelsea manning. Look what we did to people who expose war crimes inside of our country right now. We're trying. They're trying to assassinate Juliana sons. They haven't been basically solitary confinement. We literally did torture Chelsea Manning. So, uh, and then, you know, Barack Obama used, uh, he, he prosecuted lots of whistleblowing journalists using the non. Blanking on the word it's called, but, um, espionage act. So this idea that, yeah, I'm sure poor, maybe Putin didn't. Maybe that woman who wrote that book about Putin has a lot of powerful enemies. Usually you do when you are that kind of been a journalist where you're exposing the powerful. She probably didn't just expose booton. So she probably exposed a lot of people. My point being is that, uh, you know, now who's being naive gay?

Speaker 3:          00:19:06       Well, I mean she probably did expose a lot of people, but it's also very likely that Putin enter. Yes. And I'm not, I'm not denying that Barack Obama had a kill list. So these guys are out, you know, he, he took us from two hours to seven. He did Libya, turned it into a failed state. Right now they have open slave trading. No, you're watching on youtube. So dark. And they wanted to do it again. They want to do it in Syria. They want. So Joe, let me ask you a question. If we get rid of Assad in Syria, do you know who takes over? Uh, the Jesus? That's right.

Speaker 3:          00:19:40       Who starts running things, Moses, Elka, al Qaeda, El Nuestra. Yeah. Uh, so that the power vacuum that always happens. The, uh, the, the Wahhabi terrorist funded by Saudi Arabia, that's who takes over and I have video tape after videotape of our top officials admitting that Saudi Arabia Funds Isis and that we also did so and that we created, we created al Qaeda, we got, we create an isis was created because of our invasion of Iraq, but then we actually fund them and we ship them arms. So for what reason? To overthrow aside. So we can put a pipeline through Syria. So we fund them so that they fight Assad. But then Saudi Arabia funds, this isn't the first time we did that. We funded to Al Ida. So they would fight the Russians. Right. So this is the same. And then we were left with them. When was the mujahideen? That's when they were the moon.

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       Yes. Hi Dean. So, and I have videotapes of Hillary Clinton screaming about this. We created this problem. She says this on video. I have it. So, um, that's why I get trouble because I tell the truth about the war. And if you tell the truth about the war, you'll be called a conspiracy theorist by the establishment news. That's exactly what's happened. That happened to me. Or you conspiracy theorist? No, that's what they say. You know what the biggest, because I tell the truth about Syria, right? Uh, the biggest conspiracy in my lifetime was the Iraq war. That was a conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Yeah. That's legit. That's a legit conspiracy. Yeah. I mean that's when you can actually prove right. I mean I used to have a whole bit about it. I used to have a whole bit about like the, the only way to find out if someone was like from 2005, it was that the reason why they put George Bush and power is the only way to find out if someone is really stupid is to put an actual stupid guy in his president and find out if everybody freaks out because the only way to really tell. And we're like, well we could put a smart guy in there and have Mac. I'm like, no, no, no. We'll never know. We'll never know. We'll get it. We get a dumb guy. Let's just try it out and see what happens. And then it was all the whole thing about us going to war in Iraq. Like why did we go to the war over there and why? What did we tell them? And they bought that Holy Shit. And then he won again. He won again. Fuck. And then I go and you know, there's someone in the back of the room going, I think we can go dumber.

Speaker 1:          00:21:59       And that became trump. I mean, that was from 2005 from my showtime special from 13 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       Uh, let me tell you something, trump, it will be allowed to be president and was allowed to be president because he's doing the bidding of the establishment. They're on board with most of the stuff he's doing there like that. He's, he's not, he's not pulling back on any of the wars. He's, they've all ramped up the military budget. Isn't it funny Joe not protecting him from you or they're not protecting him from this, this investigation? Well, he's. Nothing's happened. Again, it's, and by the way, what they've gotten them on is all regular corruption. Like I said, trump is corrupt. Yes, he's corrupt. He's corrupt with Saudi Arabia. He's corrupt with Russia. He grew up with Israel. He's get, they're all corrupt, but he thought the Clinton Foundation and they're there all the chomsky quote, they'd all be hung if we applied the Nuremberg standards. So this is the world we're living in.

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       So this idea that somehow we need to focus extra on trump and somehow poot. And you know what, journalists, the Anti Putin journalists in Russia will tell you that we're a bunch of numbskulls over here because we're inflating Putin's power. So we are blood like he's this all powerful guy who's got his finger in every decision everywhere at all times. Ellison mulattoes now blaming the Green party being controlled by the Russians for an Ohio election. A special election. I'm not kidding. I could show you some Milana and I. Who Doesn't love Alyssa Milano, right? She's beautiful. She's one of the prettiest of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       I met her in a hotel once. Did you really wandering through the hotel. We got an elevator together. So here is can't believe him in a hotel elevator with just not as I said hello. She said hello back. And that was it.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       Did she know who you were? I don't think so. No. This is a long time ago too. She says, you know what sucks, because of our unwillingness to pass policy that protects our election integrity. I immediately think the Green party votes. And tonight's our Russian meddling. Why else would eddie would cast a protest vote in Ohio when there's so much at stake? So much at stake. That's so delusional. What is it?

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       Protest vote. What's your vote worth? If everyone votes and they all vote green, is that a protest vote? If it is possible that the Green party can win, like do you have no faith? So what they're doing is essentially just bowing down to a rig system saying the system is rigged, so just vote for side b, even though side a and b are funded by the same people I know, I know, but ideologically side B is our side. That's what she's saying.

Speaker 3:          00:24:26       So what they've gone past. So now the hashtag resistance have gone beyond voters shaming and now what they're actually doing is democracy shaming. You don't get to participate in democracy and those people. So let me tell you something. When people say, Oh, you know, the Greens take away vote. I would not have voted in the presidential election if I did not have the opportunity to vote for the Green Party. Just so those votes, you don't own those votes. The way electoral politics works is that if you don't have enough votes to win, you have to go get them and you have to appeal to those votes, but they don't have an appeal to voters. The Democratic Party, they have nothing, and so what they have left is fear and voter shaming and that's it. Now they're actually shaming democracy.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       Well, you would also think that by the time after we've gotten through this past election where no one, literally no one in the mainstream media, then maybe Fox News predicted that trump was gonna win, no one. They all were 100 percent sure hillary was gonna win. They were. They were had in the 90 percent range of probability of her winning and they were displaying it on cnn so they know that that's wrong. So why would someone think that a Green party candidate has to be, or a libertarian candidate has to be a protest vote? Why can't it be a real vote at this point when you're talking about the kind of social media outreach that is capable today that's possible today, what you a person who has some really good points, and as I look at this woman who wanted in New York, the 28 year old girls a democratic socialist, Alessandra ocozzio plant says, look, if that doesn't tell you like this world is changing in a radical way and upstarts and and, and people who are huge underdogs have the possibility of winning. It's not a protest vote. It's an actual vote. And if everybody who thinks this way votes towards that protest vote, guess what? They win. That's right. That's what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:26:13       So I used to have a joke or I would say, no, you can't vote for. You can vote for a third party candidate until a lot of people already voting for a third party candidate. Exactly. That's what they're saying. You can't vote for. They have no chance to win. So you have to wait until a lot of people are already so that people don't understand that inherent contradiction. And by the way, people maybe if you spent a 10th of the energy trying to excite the half of the country that doesn't vote as you do and trying to voter shame progressive's or Green Party or environmentalist for not giving you their vote, what you do not fucking own, you would've spent a 10th of the energy trying to excite people who don't participate to participate. Instead of shaming the people who do participate. Maybe you'd get somewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:26:58       It's also this reluctance to admit that both sides are corrupt, is this very strange thing that exists on people who operate within those narrow bandwidth. In this narrow bandwidth is whatever side you're on, whether it's you're on the right or the left, this is the side that you want to win and it's the right side and they're the good people and the other side, even though, well, even though our side does wrong, this side does worse and they operate in this real narrow bandwidth. This is why she would think something that's possibly negative for her side is a protest vote. Instead of being your actual feelings on the issue,

Speaker 3:          00:27:32       and if these people really cared about voting integrity, wouldn't they want paper ballots? If they really cared about a voter integrity, wouldn't they want rank choice voting when they want that? Then you don't, you don't, you don't have to worry about this choice voting choice. So they have it in Maine now, right? So, uh, it's where, so, you know, you, you get to, this is my first choice. This is my second choice. This is my third choice. So you don't get to. So it eliminates that. You're a spoiler, right? It's just. Yeah. So, um, and, and they voted in, in Maine and the politicians of course don't want it. So they got rid of it and the court reinstated. It hadn't been. I think it's happened twice. Now. How does it work

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       in terms of like say if you're going to vote for a governor of Maine, you have a first choice. A second choice.

Speaker 3:          00:28:20       Okay. Let's say, let's say there's three choices. So you get to, you get to say, well, let's say, let's say if your first choice was a green party candidate and you go, okay, that's my first choice, but my second choice would be the Democrat. So in my third choice would be maybe nobody. And so does second choice have different points. So if you that, if your first choice doesn't get enough votes to win, then your second choice goes, right? So that's how it works. So you're never wasting your vote. And you know, what's ironic is that, and I might have, you know, there's people who can better explain that simply. I know people are going be jamie the weighty, better way to say that I, I'm sure there's better ways, but the thing that kills me is that Bernie Sanders, his whole career was about being an independent.

Speaker 3:          00:29:01       And I have video tapes of him saying, you know, what kills me. This is like, what do I do? These talks that I talk to people, they come up to me after these debates and they said, you know, I like what you said and uh, you, you make the most sense. But I can't vote for you because you never going to win. I hate that they go, I want to waste my vote. Oh, if there's one thing I hate more than that phrase, waste your vote. This was what he was saying his entire career until now. And I want to know why. I want to know what the hell does Bernie Sanders in 2018 know that Bernie Sanders in 2006 didn't know. And Bernie Sanders in 1996 doesn't know. And he tells everybody you got to run. He's, you know, getting people to come into the Democratic Party, which is actively cheating them yet he's still seeing and him. And he still runs as an independent in Maine. I mean in Vermont. He still runs it. Everybody say you guy, you can see he gets to run as an independent.

Speaker 1:          00:29:50       He gets the running as an independent while represented. Democratic Party. Yes. So they have a special sweetheart deal is. What is he saying when he says, he's saying now that protest votes are a waste. Like what is he saying?

Speaker 3:          00:30:01       He told everybody vote for Hillary. He told. I mean, he's not starting a third party and you know, his whole life, he was like, he said that we have to have the verbiage he used. One time I saw him was that, uh, you know, uh, Jesse Jackson's correct. We knew we needed a rainbow coalition of people, uh, but it has to happen outside of the Democratic Party. He said that that was him. So we have to have a progressive coalition, but it has to happen outside and who better to lead it. But Bernie Sanders. So that's why it's hard to start a third party because you need people who are already famous and popular and, uh, in government. So if he left and he got saved, Tulsi Gabbert and Nina Turner and Alexandra Cause your court. And he got a bunch of people that are super popular on the left, we'd have a third party and that would be pulling at 10, 15 percent.

Speaker 3:          00:30:48       And now the Democrats would have to join former coalition instead of what they're doing now, which is ignoring progressives. After she cheated Bernie Sanders, after the Democrats cheated Bernie Sanders in the primary, Hillary Clinton didn't choose Bernie Sanders as their vice president, as an olive branch. Doesn't choose a little bit with worn as an olive branch. She went to her right. She got Tim Kaine was to the right of her. Who's anti union, whose. Oh, everything bad thing you want in the Corporate Democrat, he's pro walled. The whole deal. She went. So just so if we had a third party that actually pulled at 10 or 15 percent, they would have to. They couldn't do that anymore. They'd have to. They'd have to do a thing called Joe voter outreach instead of voters shaming or it's what it's devolved to now, which is democracy shaming. They're literally shaming people for participating in democracy. You don't get to participate in democracy because you're a third party will fuck you. That's called democracy. And so yes, I do. And I get to vote my conscience. It will be right back.

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       That's good. That's good. That break right there. Solid going a radio show, that will be the way to go. Hey, one of the reasons why we came in today is because we wanted to talk about the Alex Jones situation. Um, I know you were a notch as a vocal critic of Alex Jones. You spit in his face on, on live Internet show. I did not spit in his face. That was completely involuntary. He coughed and liquid came out of your mouth. As you know, Alex Jones is hilarious. There's no doubt. There's no denying that. He's occasionally very hilarious. Yes. Yeah. And I told you what happened. I was walking up. He's having this, they're just about to go fisticuffs the whole time. And as I walk up he goes, Hey, I'm just trying to be nice and you had to spit. And I had a mouthful iced tea and I understand that's my story. I'm sticking to it. Good story. You know who trump meant to say would I would actually say would. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:32:41       Yeah. He actually, what did he say? I don't see any reason why they would, but he meant to say what it's. Yeah. That was one of the worst lies I think anybody's ever told on television in front of millions of people. That was a disturbing lie because in the context of the words and the way he was communicating, it's very clear. It's very clear. He meant to say what

Speaker 3:          00:32:59       it meant. It was disconcerting to me for different reasons. It was disconcerting to me because it showed that he

Speaker 2:          00:33:05       mcadam to cave. Yeah. Someone talked to him. Someone pulled them aside and said, do you understand what the fuck is going on here?

Speaker 3:          00:33:11       By the way, when they go, oh, he did. He, uh, trump contradicted our intelligence communities in public in Helsinki, and that's treason. No ass wipe. That's not treason. The president sets our foreign policy. You're not supposed to contradict the fucking president. Whatever the president says goes, and I hate fucking saying this because I'm not a fan of Donald trump, but God damn it, we all lose our head and think that the unelected spies run our foreign policy. They do not spice spice or spice unelected. Yeah. So, and the ones who let us into Iraq, let's not forget that the very. Do Anyway, don't. Do you ever play that video? I played almost weekly on my show of Robert Molar lying about weapons of mass destruction to Congress to get us into the Iraq war.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Well, he was misinformed at the time. He wasn't aware of all the information and you know him along with Colin Powell and many others where they're just good guys, good people, good people to do it in a bad. Those those no bid contracts at Halliburton got for billions and billions of dollars. It's just because they were the right ones for the job. I mean, why have bids when you've got Halliburton and you've got a guy who's really close to Halliburton and Dick Cheney, who used to be the CEO of Halliburton as the vice president. He got a sweet deal here. Take advantage of it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:31       Halliburton gave Dick Cheney a $30,000,000 down payment when he became vice president of this little bit of that.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       Trying to help you out. I know you like to go duck hunting, give you a nice gun. Don't shoot your friend in the face. That's how I used to do a bit about that too. He shot his friend in the face and his friend, apologize, apologize. That's how gangster Dick Cheney is. Ah, I should've been there or I looked like a bird thing was so fucking crazy, you know? Um, we were talking about Alex Jones being the platform. Yeah, I mean, it seems to be across the board, like they're, it's almost waited for apple. It seems like when apple pulled them from itunes, then, you know, youtube, uh, danced with it, right? They'd given him some strikes. It was really recently, like within the last couple of that facebook had given him some strikes and Youtube gave him some strikes and people are like, hey, you know, there was some, I felt like almost like unfounded, um, speculation

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       that they would remove him from the platform. My 10 navigant or move him. That's crazy. That's too far. And then all of a sudden, boom, everybody in one fell swoop. Spotify, spotify remove him. They were going to, they did. Itunes removed him. But there's a loophole though that some of you. I saw an article today where people want nothing less than total destruction. Uh, I, that apple, uh, attacked Alex Jones and got rid of them, but they offered him a safety net in the form of the APP that he has on their APP store that they're still. So they were trying to take that down to like take down his, his show became instantly way more popular. Oh, I'm sure. So it can. The unintended consequences. I try to tell people that, uh, you know, I'm not defending Alex Jones. I'm defending, you know, the principle of freedom of speech.

Speaker 1:          00:36:26       You know, people who are convicted of killers or. No, on death row, they still get their freedom of speech. You're allowed to print articles and they're allowed to have, you know what I mean? They're still allowed to. Oh, he's allowed to still. I mean, he does. He's hasn't been silenced. He has his website, but he could put his show out on his website. He can, he can host it from his website and it could all be fine, but these major media companies now, they just decided we've had enough. We don't want this on, and here's the thing, like, I don't know what he said that they were, there was the straw that broke the camel's back. It seemed like it's not a recent statement that says go to the court transcripts and we'll figure out. Oh, there wasn't. There wasn't a, Oh, there is no hearing or nothing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       There wasn't a judicial hearing. There was no. Come on. Do they just want, they let some Jag off billionaire in the middle of the night on a whim, fucking do this. Is that what happened? Do you think that's what it is? That was some billionaire or do you think it's the middle managers and the executives at all these giant tech companies have just decided? Um, I don't know. It's, it's definitely, uh, the government tells facebook, uh, what to do a lot of times. Right. And so they bow to the government all the time because they don't want to be regulated. So, uh, that's why they just, they just started having hearings with. That's why they had those hearings. Should we regulate facebook? So those hearings, by the way, we're fucking bizarre. It was like a guy pretending to be human, you know, it's like some sort of a robot or an alien the way you would sip water. He would take like this and it was like a guy spitting dip into a glass. He would go to. It was the weirdest little sips. Someone should make a compilation of Zuckerberg, sips of water. Whoever is that guy who makes their compilations of your show. He does a good job as a funny job by those Zuckerberg or pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:38:24       No senator. No Sir. There. Watch this. Watch that. Sip. Give me another one of those. Oh, there is one. They have them. Yeah. Oh, so there is a tricky water. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Watch them sip who fucking sips water like that. It's like he has to think about it. Act Normal. Be Human. Humans drink water, drink the water. Slowly he tilted that glass at him and the guy behind him at the same colored tie. That's the guy that they're going to shoot in the head keeping eye contact while he was drinking the water. It's kind of weird trying to at least be disrespectful. Fantastic. That, that whole thing was so strange. It was so what a better guy to, uh, to, to protect us from fake news and tell us what's real news and you know, who has integrity and what doesn't. Then a guy who made a couple of billion dollars off a stolen idea from his friends. I mean, I think that's the perfect guy to say that. The true story. Is that what he actually did he, I think that's what was in the movie, right?

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       That was in the movie. That's what I know. I didn't see the movie. Oh, okay. Yeah, I know the story though was that he ripped people off that it wasn't his idea, but he was the one who figured out a way to wrestle at a get rich as fuck. But this is Matt Taibbi wrote an article on this second, August second about this and um, there's been a lot of people being platform from facebook that you don't know about. Like, this isn't like, uh, okay. So, um, here's, here's what he's, they shut down lots of other sites at the behest of the government in Israel, like the, and the Atlantic Council. So pages like black elevation, they got shut down a page called mindful being. They got shut down. A facebook also wiped out, no unite the right to it, which is a page appearing to advertise a counter rally on the upcoming anniversary of the violence in Charlottesville.

Speaker 3:          00:40:20       So they shut that down to Matt, how you beat it. Let me just give you a quick quote from his article. He says, facebook was helped in its efforts to wipe out these dangerous memes by the Atlantic Council on whose board you'll find confidence inspiring names like Henry Kissinger, Cia, chief, Michael Hayden, former acting cio, had Michael Morel and former Bush era homeland security chief Michael Chertoff. These people now have their hands on what is essentially a direct lever over nationwide news distribution. It's hard though to state the potential mischief that lurks behind this union of Internet platforms and would be government censors at Kennedy's. Read you one more paragraph because this is. This is exactly what we're talking about. He says, it is already a scandal that these defacto private media regulators have secret algorithmic processes that pushed down some news organizations in favor of others, which they do witness the complaints by outlets like alternate truth dig and others that big platforms have been deemphasizing alternative sites in the name of combating fake news. But this week's revelation is worse when facebook works with the government and want to want to be star chamber organizations like the Atlantic Council to delete sites on national security grounds using secret methodology. It opens the door to nightmare possibilities that you'd only find in Dystopian novels. So he goes out and it's, it's awesome what he says, but I'm.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       We would have more comfort if. I mean, there's no, like one of the things that they're doing is they use that blanket term hate speech.

Speaker 3:          00:41:50       Yeah. So by the way, so now they're trying to put a bill. Have you heard about this in Congress to make police a protected class of people? So if you say shit about them now it's considered hate speech. Did you know that? Yeah. They're trying to make peep. Yes. So fuck. The police would be considered hate speech. So they would just retroactively arrest Nwa. They could not iced tea, man. Cop Killer. Right motherfucking cop killer. And so now if you do have a rally that's against the police, that's a hate rally and they can take your youtube channel down if you said hate stuff about the cops and such. So. So that that's where we are. Hate speech. The fuck. How come I'm not allowed to hate shit by the way. I hate Nazi's. Can I say I hate fucking Nazis. I hate the KKK. Can I say I hate them? That's hate speech. I. You strongly disliked the KKK. You can strongly disliked something. When I was a kid, I hated the fucking dodgers. I know speech because I was a cubs fan and the doctors always kicked out. It's fish.

Speaker 2:          00:42:47       Yeah. Hate speech is a strange blanket term. Almost like drugs, you know, drugs is caffeine, but it's also heroin. You know, it's like drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:42:55       What's wrong with it? I don't understand what it is. There's hate out there. So what? So what's. So by the way, I

Speaker 2:          00:43:01       bad way of expressing things like hate speech is, it's not a good descriptive because I agree. When you, when you stopped the, what does it entail? Like you know, I had a conversation with a woman at Youtube about Sam Harris and I'm a Douglas Murray and a podcast where they had had a conversation and someone put it on their youtube channel in their playlist, just put it in their playlist and they got a community guidelines.

Speaker 3:          00:43:29       Oh, I,

Speaker 2:          00:43:31       I asked why and the woman said very cleanly it was hate speech. And I said, what are you talking about? I go, did you listen to it? It was a two intellectuals to public intellectuals discretion discussing immigration and some of the problems that Europe is having right now. And you decided that that's hate speech and you don't even know what they said but that. But the fact that she's so confidently described it in that way sort of, it sort of embodies what this problem is, is that they have these blanket terms. There were other throw on problems and there's a million other fires to put out. So there's no more needed to put any more consideration to this. This guy is a problem. This is problematic. This is hate speech. Shut it down.

Speaker 3:          00:44:10       People don't realize how bad it is for all you do because you know this story. But people go, Oh, good for Alex Jones. He shouldn't be able to do that stuff. What? He's doing that good. I'm like, do you not understand that this is the shot across the bow, that if they can do this to Alex Jones, that they're coming. I've already been trashed by the establishment media, by the Washington Post, by. I've already been equated to pedophiles and those kinds of things and conspiracy theorists and I been in articles with Alex Jones. They've done it to me. So because I tell the truth about the war, right? And so, uh, the antidote to bad speech, if you really hate what Alex Jones is doing, the antidote to bad speech is not censorship. The antidote to bad speech is more speech. If you think, if you think what Alex Jones is doing needs to be debunked, create a facebook page called debunking Alex Jones and debunk him.

Speaker 3:          00:45:01       The old Kyle Kalinsky does that kind of stuff all the time. People do that stuff all the time. That's how you convert. If you're afraid of an idea, you don't shut down the idea, you expose the idea and you debunk it, but if you have a private platform and you own this and you start a business and your businesses putting up youtube videos and you decide that someone is putting up something that's hurtful and damaging and racist and it could be used to attack large groups of people and then you see like all the craziness that's been connected to the alt right movement and you associate that with this individual. Do you have to keep that on your platform? I mean there's no regulation right now. No, not like technic public utilities or it should be though. That's my point. My point is that 70 percent of the people get their news from Google and facebook and they're a monopoly, right?

Speaker 3:          00:45:50       So they had planned on ballistic powers. 70 present. Yeah, that's, that was, uh, that was a stat I read today. So you can't. It's like, well, it's written that turn on and off. I believe it. Hey, they took. They took stretch. Yeah. They, you think it's a stretch? It's says 45 percent of the people get straight from facebook. That means $150. Million people are on facebook every single day. Yeah, I would think that's not accurate. No, but I think that's right. But when they get their news, we don't have three people in this room aren't. So that's three people right here. They're aren't. But I get my news from Google. Good. I have that Google App on my phone and every, every day I go to it in the morning when I'm taking a shit and I go over like, what's crazy today? What's happening? Oh, new porsche coming out.

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       One sentence like Sacha Baron Cohen do one sentence. Let's see what they said. I just looked at it. It's what it said. Forty five percent. I get it from, from a facebook ad to. Is it a Gallup poll? It was according to their stats and I went back to read another rolling stone article to find out. Right, and it's a bunch of like a facebook article, selling advertisements, trying to find the data. So even even, even if you clip it with those, we can't deny like Alex Jones cannot now go, well, just go to the other youtube, just go to the other facebook. There isn't another. So we have to recognize that the way we are organized as a society, that the town square is now owned by corporations who that need to be regulated. Right? Like before, if you know when 18 t was the phone carrier for everybody, they couldn't go, I'm not going to give Alex Jones a phone service because I don't like the shit. He's saying that. So you know, we, you can't deny services, somebody, all that stuff. That's not really a valid comparison because the phone wasn't distributed

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       information to people. The phone service is just a method of communication. It was just a utility. What he's able to do through info wars is if you've got them on your platform, he's going to say some things and he's going to use your platform to say some things that you know, might not be true. It might be crazy. So you've got to decide like when does it become a problem? And I think where they drew the line with Sandy Hook.

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       So here's what I say, Joe, uh, we need to treat these as public utilities because they are right facebook, there is no alternative. There is an alternative to youtube. We need to deregulate them. Well, it's a long overdue by the way. And they are monopolies. We, there's obvious to everyone that there are monopolies, but you know, when you, when you invent something called whatsapp and then facebook buys it for $20, billion dollars, there's a monopoly, there's no way. There's no way to, to compete with these people. So these are monopolies. They need to be regulated and people's need to be protected. And it, it, it, that's how, that's where we need to go because right now we're leaving it up to the whims of a billion. Like you'd say, Hey, if Alex Jones really did some shit that was wrong and he should be taken off, or his free speech should be a bridge for it, do it.

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       Let's do it. Go go to a court or go to a thing or go. People go, well, he docks his people and he didn't. I go is if doxing is illegal, he should be prosecuted. If that's what happened, but you shouldn't take away. Did he docs people? That's what they're saying. They're saying he's died. He wanted he docs people from newtown or whatever from the school shooting, so that's what they're talked about. The individuals that he gave their addresses and their names. That's what they are saying, that he decay, but let's find out if he actually did that because that sounds crazy. I, I, I'm, I don't know if he did,

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       but they're not saying what he actually did. This is what's crazy. I keep hearing that he promoted the idea that sandy hook was a false, was false and that it was a false flag and that these were all actors. I don't know if he actually said that. I think what he actually said was, I don't know if that happened. I think that's what he actually said. People are saying, well, that's promoting the idea that it was a hoax someone, but I want to know if that's what he really said. See, I don't know if that's even the case because I've heard it. I've heard it written that he promoted the idea that sandy hook was a conspiracy, but I did not quoting. When they say that there's no quotes, there's no. Sandy Hook was a hoax. Those kids were actors. Those kids are not dead. I don't see that anywhere, but they keep attributing that to him without quotation.

Speaker 3:          00:50:00       But again, if this. If there was some kind of process due process where you could go back and look at the transcript. No,

Speaker 2:          00:50:06       not only that. If during this whole time where he's being tried, he was still labeled to be on youtube and have his videos. He could show in his videos that he didn't say that he could show what he actually said and tell you what he actually said and show clips. He can't do that anymore. So now the narrative is completely in the hands of the mainstream media, 100 percent. So the Alex Jones narrative is being taken 100 percent out of his hands and now it's in the mainstream media and now there's sandy hook denier, conspiracy theorists, right wing, lunatic, all these different things. Which mayor, if some of it. I mean Alex my fucking nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:50:43       So my point is we've had nuts. People would always tell that when I was a kid, Joe, maybe you remember Johnny Carson used to go ape shit about the national enquirer. Yes. Do you remember that? And it was a big deal. He would stop his show and I'm putting my foot down about this. They still have the national and nobody said take it out of the supermarkets. Nobody was like, we've got a band in that newspaper because we can't handle the ideas from this newspaper that they're still right there. You go to Ralph's, they're right there. They're the last thing you see before they leave. They're right at the eye level for kids. Nobody what says, take away the national. And I went to facebook. They still have a facebook page. Natural acquirer. Yes. So does the World News daily. And you know what the first news news story was that came up on world news dailies was a British man can only dedicate through his mouth. That was the first story that came up. The first story. You don't have to look for it. British man, Devin. Kate's through his mouth. I'm like, dude, this is like South Park and it's not like you want them to be taken down as well. But it's what's interesting is like World News daily and

Speaker 2:          00:51:42       Star magazine, all those, they've sort of been there a joke like, you know, it's not real, you know, the enquirer is not real, but we know that, but it's not.

Speaker 3:          00:51:51       It's just finding those. So. But he's buying. Are they buying the other kind of buying somebody watches professional wrestling.

Speaker 2:          00:51:58       Here it goes, lawsuit quotes, Jones saying. Yeah. So sandy hook is a synthetic. Completely fake. Is, is a thin synthetic. Completely fake with actors in my view, manufactured. Okay. I would show the visual, right? January 13th, 2015. The lawsuit quotes Joan saying. Yeah. So Sandy. Yeah. So sandy hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors. My view manufactured. Yeah, you that you actually nail that impression. I spent a lot of time with that dude drunk. If there's a. he's. I'm like, that's, that's a real problem saying something like that. It's crazy. But he's, he's look, he, his whole business is saying things that are sometimes right and saying things that are sometimes absolutely wrong, you know? And, and that's. And it's all wild and it's all globalists. And you ever seen that song that they did with these guys? Took his actual words and rants, but then they have like this like emo song singing the words.

Speaker 2:          00:53:07       No fucking genius. Would we get pulled over off of Youtube if we play that? Let's find out if we get yanked for this one because it's brilliant because it's, it's a parody, but it's so. It's so deep. Focus on. Yeah. He said he was fine enough. There's two indie folk, emo. Just, you know, some low testosterone music. Please listen to this. Listen, listen, listen to this. And that's why we're just doing simple things. Pointing out that we're meant to be a nature natural and this is where we find the source that God made your transcend the new world order and that's why they want to try to keep us out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:49       Factors keeping

Speaker 2:          00:53:53       what? Taking audio out. Oh, you're taking the audio off. Alex Jones rants as an indie folk song for people that are just listening to this. You gotta Google this because we removed the sound from Youtube. Oh, okay. Babies. Babies. We love. Say we want to eat babies. I have the video you just said could not fill it. Oh, Paul and Hillary posts. But like so far, this is song literal Fab, Pyre potbelly.

Speaker 4:          00:55:04       Come on.

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       Oh, oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       Uh, you know, I think there's something. There's something about his struggle right now that's representative of the chaotic world that we live in, that that he does have this giant voice than he does is they have this giant following and that it is this, this is actual words come out in song like that and are so hysterical and that they think that somehow or another yanking this guy off all these platforms is gonna like remove it. Do they understand the streisand effect? Because this is just gonna. It's going to be another way, but what's the streisand effect? Barbara streisand had a house in Malibu, just giant ass house. They took pictures of it and she went ape shit and you know, complained to all these newspapers and complained to the police and everything that they're taking photos of her house and get the fuck Outta here. This I'm Barbara streisand. And because of that it became a giant story that Barbara streisand is pissed. If someone's showing her house and they're like, wow, it must be a hell of a house. Where is it? And then there it is. The effects is a phenomenon.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       There's the house whereby an attempt to hide remover sensor, a piece of information, unintended consequences of publicizing the information more wildly, usually facilitated by the Internet. Okay. Yeah. No, I thought you,

Speaker 3:          00:56:46       but on print, again, people may make the false equate. Oh, you're defending Alex. Joe. I'm not defending defending free speech, defending free speech and I understand the argument that, hey, it's a private corporation. I get that. I get that. But if you took a look at the bigger picture, the should beat. Everyone thinks the internet should be a public utility. I mean, most people do and that's what they're upset that they're not treating it like a public utility. Obama administration did. They decided to at the last minute. And so if you think the Internet should be a public utility, I think youtube and facebook should be a public utility also and but there's the, there's an opening for other people to make their own youtube, like make a version of it if you have them an efficient capital, but you don't. And there's some. And if you do start it, they'll just buy you out.

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       Like I just showed you the example of whatsapp with nightwood, $19,000,000,000 on whatever they paid for. It was some crazy. So that's a, just eat up their competition right now. We need to Teddy Roosevelt to come along and break up all these monopolies. It's never gonna happen. Uh, the end of the empire is coming. So here's the question, like, is there a valid parallel, a valid comparison? Like are there people that have things that are more hateful that are on youtube that haven't been deep platforms? Is it the influence that he has that it's terrifying? Is it the fact that he's a figurehead for this kind of stuff? Is that what it is that he's the. This whole info wars movement is in some people's mind a figurehead for this pro trump thing. They're trying to stop and silence. Like what is it? I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:58:22       It's very curious that it all happened at the same time. Right? And because there's a, there's a, um, in 1996 there was a law passed that actually insulates the platforms for being sued. Did you know that? So like for them. So if someone puts up something like say he puts something up that leads to someone getting killed, right? On facebook, you can't, you can't sue youtube, you can't sue facebook for it. That's in that 1996 law. Um, so there's that. So I get that they're a private company, but again, they have to have the protection of the law. They have congress protecting them. So they have a certain. That's a certain type of regulation you're regulated from. You can't sue them. Right? So I'm looking for this tweet bike, Glenn Greenwald that really, because if we're going to take down here, I'll find it. I'll find it.

Speaker 3:          00:59:12       Here it is. He says there's been a tactic of sensors for centuries. They start with someone who was so utterly hated and marginalized that everyone is blinded by their hatred for the first central ship target that they cheer and forget that they're endorsing a principle and power that will then expand. And so right now they came for the Jews. Yeah. Right now we're allowing, uh, the whim of billionaires in the middle of the night to decide who gets to be on these monopolistic platforms and who doesn't. If there was 10 youtube, no one would care, but there isn't. There's one youtube, there's one facebook and they are monopolies and that's the world we live in right now and that's why they are doing whatever the government wants them to because they don't want the government to regulate them. That's why he went there and was sipping the water like that and trying to make guide tat contact and be nice because he doesn't want them to regulate them.

Speaker 3:          01:00:03       He'll do it for. I'll do Julian assange and 2010 gave a speech which I saw recently on a plane where he predicted this. He was like, the corporations are an extension of the government and they will do the censorship in the future. And that's exactly what's happening right now. So do you think is the government that sensory Alex Jones, because I would think that the government that's in power currently would want to keep Alex Jones and position because he's a supporter of trump. He's a supporter of, you know, why does, so why does, why is trump going after Julian assange just because he's afraid he'll expose him someday. I don't know. Why is he allowing the CIA to do that, to go after Julian assange and you know, that just shows you how shitty the journalists are in America because not one of them are standing up for Julian to signs and they're all pretending that when trump says mean things about Jim Acosta, that somehow that's this unbelievable violation of our freedom and our press and he's got you son of a bitch.

Speaker 3:          01:00:52       You don't care if you cared about freedom of the press. You would say something about Julian Assan and no one is saying, what lie has Julian assange is ever printed. Never, never, never, never. What did Julian assange's do? He revealed that our election was being rigged by the Democratic Party, not Russia, but by the Democratic Party. And that is a sin you can commit. You can not tell the truth about the powerful. And that's what's happening right now. And uh, you know, he, he revealed the CIA in has, although spying techniques that they can get your tv to listen to you, your phone, a vault seven, all that stuff he revealed that's why they want to get them. But I trump, you know, I just think that trump is just, you know, he's not really clued in, right? He's, lets other. He's glad to let the generals do the job and his underlings, he doesn't really want.

Speaker 3:          01:01:41       He wants to paint broad strokes and lets everyone you want to kill Julian. Sounds. Go ahead. I don't give a f that's I think how he feels. I don't think it's his plan to do it, but everybody else underneath it wants to. And certainly the intelligence community and everyone forgets this. Chuck Schumer went on Rachel Maddow show like two years ago and right out in public said that trump is making a mistake by crossing the intelligence community because when you mess with them, they have six ways to Sunday to mess with you back. Holy Shit. And nobody cared that he said that. So what he's saying is the president should be afraid of unelected spooks, unelected bureaucrats, these don't. They should be, he should be afraid of them. That is. And no one went. What, what the apps could you imagine saying that about Barack Obama? Hey, Barack Obama better be nice to the CA.

Speaker 3:          01:02:23       They're gonna to eft with him as an elected official to official saying that almost almost sanctioning it. Yes. And then we have Eugene Robinson and the Washington Post or writing an articles begging the deep state to undermine about trump's foreign policy. Did you see that article? No. Yes. Pulitzer Prize winner. First they spend all their life denying there is a deep state. And that new gene Robinson writes an article begging the deep state to defy president, uh, president trump. So blinded by ideology that they don't see the consequences of this. There's unintended consequences. And here they are and they're coming. They've already come for me. They're already coming for the left third. This is how, this is how this works. So again, that's why I worn all my friends about the Russia gate. Nonsense Chomsky said, if you care about the people meddling in our election, Russia would be the last place I would look.

Speaker 3:          01:03:14       The first place to look is concentrated capital. That's what dictates who are going to be our government. That's why we don't have the things the rest of the world has because we have a cut. Capital has captured our government, which is why we don't have medicare for all, which is why we don't have free college, which is why we don't have an infrastructure plan, which is why we're in a wars. Meanwhile, people have to countries poor or low income. Sixty three percent of the country can't afford a thousand dollar emergency and a quarter of all kids are in poverty in the richest country in the world. Joe, what do you call a system that takes the richest country in the world that renders half of its population poor or low income? That's a failed fucking system and that's what we're living in right now and it's failing worldwide.

Speaker 2:          01:03:55       Now. If you were someone like Google though, or who owns youtube or if you were itunes or any of these platforms that have spotify when you get an overwhelming volume of complaints about someone who's in the news right now, because the fact that Alex Jones is being sued by the Sandy Hook parents, this is what started this all off because to people this is so egregious, these poor parents lost their children and here's this guy. It's horrible saying that it's fake and that they don't want that on their platform. So would you think that they should just delete the episode that has that? It says that, should they do that or should they allow that episode?

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       I, I, so, uh, here's the, here's the solution. If, if there's, if he did do something in a video that is illegal, take that video down until it gets adjudicated. You don't see platform of 100, you don't give him the death penalty.

Speaker 2:          01:04:55       Right. So, okay. What about like stormfront, what have you got? Like some white supremacist group. It's calling for violence against people. You Do, you take them down.

Speaker 3:          01:05:04       I think you would. Again, you would have to, I would like to see in some kind of adjudication, you know, again, I, the blanket policies and things saying things like hate speech. It's all interpretation in bed. Just a week ago, Mark Zuckerberg was defending it. He was defending that, that we have holocaust deniers on our platform, holocaust deniers. Joe, and that's not fake news. That's not going. You're not going to take that down like I just told you. They have guys deprecating out of their mouth. They have this thing. They have the, the, the, the, uh, the national enquirer. They're still cool. So this is a very squiggly line. Joe. And again, there's, there's no board, there's no adjudication. It's not transparent

Speaker 2:          01:05:40       parents, not rational either. This is not a rational debate.

Speaker 3:          01:05:43       Uh, let me just, the sheer. Let me just give you one more thing about what he says when this is Matt Taibbi. He says, the sheer market power of these companies over information flow has always been the real threat. This is why breaking them up, she'd have long ago become a national priority instead, as was obvious during the Senate hearing with Mark Zuckerberg earlier this year, politicians are more interested in using then curtailing the power of these companies. The platform for their part will cave rather than be regulated. The end game here couldn't be clearer. This is how authoritarians marriages begin and people should be very worried.

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       They should be worried. They should be worried, especially if this does escalate. I understand that people who believed that he's a sandy hook deniers and they read those words, they don't want him to have a platform. They don't want them to be able to spread that hate and they understood. I understand that they would feel like imagine being one of those parents and you lost your kid and you're, you're. You're seeing this guy on tv or on youtube saying it's all fake. It's, it's outrageous and it's repulsive. I agree. It's offensive and I get that, but I think it's, it's, it's very dangerous. It's very dangerous to silence people that may or may not have any other recourse in terms of like he doesn't have the ability to defend himself, it doesn't have the ability to make a video about it unless he puts it on his own website and then who's going to watch it like this, the stuff that they're doing with youtube, it's just, it's a slippery slope, you know, and especially when they use these terms like hate speech, they're not like when you say like what do they say?

Speaker 2:          01:07:30       And they say that he violated their terms, correct. Yes. So what, what are those terms that he violated and what is the specific violation? Like what are the words that he said where you were like, enough is enough. If that's the case, how did you let him get away with saying all this other shit for years and years and what, when, when do you draw this line? Like just that video that we played, you know, they smell like sulfur, they eat it, they want to eat babies screaming. I love Satan. And the one of the babies like, Whoa, what? Where does the line get drawn? I just, I don't, I don't think. I don't think that should be up to subjectivity. I think that should be a very, very hard question that's answered with very clear facts. You

Speaker 3:          01:08:13       should have an adversarial judicial with

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       an impartial judge or jury. And how would you even get someone impartial instead? They have inhouse decide decisions. Well, you heard that. I mean you heard Matt Taibbi does delineate the people who are involved in this stuff and by the way, facebook's taken down pages of people who are Palestinians because the Israeli government tells them to do it. Do you know about that? Right? I had heard about it. Yes. So that's them doing the bidding. The government says take a down, take it you. They don't get to free speech. Okay. Because I don't want the government to get mad at me because we're making so much goddamn money right now. I don't want the government to get mad at us. That's what facebook and youtube is doing. See if I would like that. If someone, you know, I'm not saying that no one should be taken down.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       If someone's calling for the death of all black people and like maybe it's not a good place to give them a platform, but I feel like the problem that I'm having with this is these things like air quotes, hate speech, because I told you that they said that about Sam Harrison Douglas Murray. Now that is fucking crazy. So when is it stopping hate speech? Like when? When do you draw the line? When it's mildly offensive, is that hate speech? Like where's it go? Where does it go? Where we're not allowed to hate people. I don't understand why I don't get that. I'm not being a dick. I honestly, why aren't you allowed to hate things? Right. I don't. I understand that calling for action I think is the call for action might be. I mean, I guess it's a legal term that this is not a legal term though.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       The when they blanket things with hate speech, like we were saying, was calling something a drug, this is an illegal drug. Well, what if caffeine becomes an illegal drug then? Is that the same as meth? It's clearly not. There's different things. So when you say hate speech and you also lumped Douglas Murray having an intellectual conversation with Sam Harris about immigration, you lump that in. So that's the kind of soft. And so did you know that right before fourth of July there was a newspaper, I think it was in Texas. And so they wanted to for the fourth of July, they wanted to post the declaration of independence. So they posted the first half of it. Did you know about this? Facebook gave him a strike for hate speech, hate speech. They gave him a strike and so now they're like, they were like, that was an algorithm though, right?

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       They picked up some of the phrase or the phrasing in there about slavery and stuff like that. And then being animals or something like that. I don't know, something like that. I'm not sure what it was. But. And then the newspaper said, now we're afraid to post the second half of the declaration because we'll get a second strike and they might pull our whole page. Yeah. So again, when they released that strike. Correct. So, so yeah. So what is this book? Pill? What is this idea that I need a nanny state to protect me from the ideas? I think they're worried about the power of propaganda and it's just they don't know exactly what the consequences of suppressing that power of propaganda are. I think that's really the primary issue. They're worried that a guy like Alex Jones already has this massive following his what he's done by calling sandy hook fake may, may be awful, I believe is, but

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       is it enough to completely diy platform him and how? How are they, how are they?

Speaker 3:          01:11:19       Even if it was, let's say it was, let's just say you and I agree that it is okay. They shouldn't. Shouldn't there still be some kind of a process? There should be. That's what I'm saying. It shouldn't be. Even if we agreed, and again, I hate that. I hate it as much as you hate it, I'm with you and that people are going to. I know Joe, last time I was on your show, I said, I said people are going to take what I'm saying right now and twisted and that's exactly what they did to me last night. So I'm sure people did who took it and twisted it. I don't want, you don't have to name names, but what did they do? They say they twisted what we were. So when we're talking about seth rich, they twisted and I said, you know, I did, was covered on my show until this day.

Speaker 3:          01:11:57       People still say I was pushing it. I do a new show. I covered it, but even discussing it and even you can't even discuss like I couldn't cover it, couldn't discuss it and that. And so that's exactly what happened. Somebody cut me saying that and cut some other stuff and put it together. And I was like, son of a bitch. But you, so what are you going to do? Right? So what are you gonna do? So, um, so I just want people to know this is again, I'm just as offended as everybody. I'm saying we need to have these things be public utilities for a lot of reasons. And that, um, you know exactly what Matt Tie. He'd be said what the end game here is very clear and they want to be able to censor people. They want to be able to censor and the first people are going to come after his left wing organizations.

Speaker 3:          01:12:34       They're could come after black lives matter. They're connected, already come after left. He's like, why did they think they're going to come after to black lives matter? What do you mean there? I their hate speech against the police. You kidding me. They already said they're controlled by the Russians. Who is they? Who is they saying that and who's they gonna come after them. What do you mean by that? So. Well, the FBI will infiltrate them. They are, I'm sure they already have, you know, how that works. So you know, how all that stuff works. So that's how that stuff works. And um, and then just credit them and then they will commit violence in their name and say, oh look, black lives matters are violent. No, that was a cop doing it, you know, that didn't help that. That's what happened up in Dapple, you know, that's the kind of stuff they do up there. And then provocateur. Exactly. Right. So by the way, I learned about that from Alex Jones. So that's the problem with Alex Jones. He's right about stuff sometimes.

Speaker 2:          01:13:19       Well, he was way more right about stuff in the past. Alex himself and I've talked to him about this, says he drinks too much and he's getting too crazy. It needs to go on a diet and exercise and start getting his life in order and he takes things too far sometimes and he should take those off the rails. He goes off the rails like he. He and I had a conversation, but he got mad at me for saying that I didn't think George Soros was a Nazi and so he had this whole thing. We ranted ray and then we talked back and forth and he apologized and he said, I sometimes have to far what I'm talking to. Aliens will say that unit, but I think he recognizes that sometimes he's just caught up in that cycle of outrage, that cycle of outrage. It just, there's no room for error.

Speaker 2:          01:14:08       There's no room to step back and sort of reset is. It's this constant outrage constantly under attack. And then there's these words that get thrown around that sort of lose their meaning, like globalists and shills and, and, and you know, and this, this sort of attitude that there's this, there's this cabal of evil that is trying to take, take over the world. And at one point Alex had this idea that they were going to try to kill off most people and you remember that. I heard about it. There's this idea that they wanted to a youth and I orj was genocide. They wanted to, they wanted to break it down to what is the word where they talk about doing that to talk about reducing the population. There's like some sort of a conspiracy theorist, term of reduction of population to a sustainable number of super evil geniuses that could live forever.

Speaker 2:          01:15:04       And they wanted to get it down to like, you know, 500 million people worldwide that can live for a million years or some crazy shit. But I think that that's that whole cycle of like constant outrage and everything's a conspiracy and you get whacked, whacked out and caught up in it. If you go back to Alex's earlier videos, I met Alex in 98 I believe, and back then Alex was, he was going after George w dot Bush when George W dot Bush was running for president and he was saying that this guy is a, he's a, he's a puppet and that he's a puppet of the CIA and you know, and, and he, you know, he supports genocide and he was showing up at campaign rallies and they were arresting him. He was anti right wing. I mean he was, he was anti what he thought was this globalist agenda.

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       He also infiltrated Bohemian Grove when everybody thought the Bohemian Grove is nonsense. There's nothing really going on. He's like, no, these really rich people are getting together with heads of state and foreign dignitaries and they're dressing up like fucking druids. And they have an effigy that they burned in front of the owl God Molek and people like, he's crazy. Then he releases the video and like, oh my God, they really do do that. Like he did some good work. The World Trade Organization protests in his, his video nine slash 11, a road to tyranny right after nine slash 11. He releases this video that shows that the World Trade Organization protests were infiltrated by these agent provocateurs who are most likely government agents with government agent. Boots on, by the way, shows this in the video. They smash windows. They're all wearing masks, had light things on fire. Then they're all. They all hold up in one house.

Speaker 2:          01:16:50       They negotiate with the police and are eventually released. This is all done under. I mean he proved all this. He showed all how this is going like, look at these peaceful protesters. Then the consequences of that, they established a no protest line at the WTO where you couldn't go by with a pin on have you tried to get through with a that said, w t o with a red line through it. They told you you could not wear that pin. You can't come through here. This is a node protest zone, and he's like, this is the consequences of this kind of censorship and this is how they establish the censorship. They make it seem like your organization is violent and dangerous by introducing violent, dangerous elements in the, in the form of an undercover police officers or military. They smash windows tip over newspaper stands and it was fucking create chaos so that the government has to come in because now we have a violent situation, so then the military comes in and arrest protestors and silences the protests so they don't look embarrassing in front of all these people from foreign countries that are coming here to the World Trade Organization.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       I didn't know he showed that, but dude, he look, he's not wrong always, and he was more right back then. He was also more sane back then. His, he was more measured and more calm. It wasn't this. He didn't have the big moon face back then either and he wasn't drinking as much. I don't think in the screaming and spitting and and you know, you ask him, he'll say, well, I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of corruption, all the shit that he sees every day. Do you remember he was crying when trump bombed Syria? He was crying because he was crying that trump fucked us. You know what I mean? He, I really genuinely believe most of the time that he means. Well, the, the, the, the thing is we look for conspiracies everywhere, like everything that's experiencing you're off track and I don't think there's anyone there that can sit down and go, stop, hold on.

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Let's examine this in a factual way. Let's stop. Cut The hyperbole out and let's look at what the facts are and where are we getting these facts and why do we think this is happening? Why do you think this is fake? Because that sounds fucking crazy to me. No one's there to do that. If someone was there to do that, I think he probably would be stopped and would examine things. It would balance out, you know, like one of the reasons why I wanted to have him on my podcast when I did was because I wanted people to see the Alex that I know because people like, how could you know that guy? I'm like, look at how he is when I get them high and we get drunk and he's laughing about stuff and talking about interdimensional child molesters and all that. This is what I wanted everybody to see. Like this is Alex Jones. He's a fun guy. It's just that, that is not a good position to be in where you're constantly looking for conspiracies everywhere you go. And you might nail a few, but then you might call out a bunch of them that are fake, which not just negates the ones that you nailed but negates everything you say as soon as you're one of those guys that everything's a conspiracy and then dead kids aren't really dead and everyone's an actor. And like everything that you say that it's good, they're going to stop.

Speaker 3:          01:19:53       My uh, thing is that I focus on the ones that are important, right? That I think is right. I'm like, I don't, I care about wars and the lies that are told about wars from the media, which the media pushes every war in my lifetime. So that's the ones I care about. I hear everything you're saying. And um, yeah, I don't, I didn't really know. I got to say God, I didn't really know much about Alex Jones until the, I met him, you know, very famously at that incident, I didn't really, I never really watched them. I went home that night. I watched some of his videos, which is when I found out some of them are really funny and uh, so I, honest to God, I didn't really know much about him and so I don't even know this stuff. So

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       if you could find that Jamie CV, did they pull all that stuff from youtube? Everything but doesn't so else have it probably on their channel.

Speaker 3:          01:20:44       And I did, I never did videos about him or debunked, but I just, you know, it just, he wasn't in my sight line of sight. I was busy making fun of MSNBC and CNN. That's what I like to do.

Speaker 2:          01:20:56       Yeah, it's, it's, it's all very confusing to me and all. I don't think he should say those things. I don't think he should say lies about kids not being dead. The, the, the horrors of being a parent and your kid was shot. And school shooting and then some guy saying that there are 100 percent actors and fake and lead. That's horrible stuff. There's a guy who was one of the parents that was a conspiracy theorist until this happened, you know, he was a conspiracy theorist. He believed all that stuff. And then his son was killed and then they started calling him a fraud and saying he was an actor and saying it never happened and that he's a paid shill and you know, and there's a big article about this, this guy. I mean you see this guy talk and it's heartbreaking. You know, you read his words, it's heartbreaking. You can imagine your son was murdered in one of the biggest school maskers ever, if not the biggest. Right? And here's people running around, emailing you and sending you tweets and facebook messages that you're a fraud. And then you, you know, you work for the globalists and this is all just a plot to take our guns away. It's like holy.

Speaker 3:          01:22:03       These things are. That's the people who think the old school shootings that they're all set up to so they can take our guns away.

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       They think that about everything. They thought that about the country music festival shooting in Vegas because they felt like, hey, here's a way to get those people on our side because those are all the second amendment people, the country music people. What better people to get to turn against the second amendment that a bunch of people that are. I mean I guarantee you if you had like a red light that went off every time, like on the top of someone's head, if there were a national rifles agency, if they were an NRA member in that audience, I bet there'll be a lot of fucking lights a, but a lot of those people are nra people. Lot of people who are gun owners. I better just gun owners. How many people are gun owners? A bit fucking half. At least half the audience. Probably one of the strongest demographics.

Speaker 2:          01:22:51       You could find. Country Music, gun owners. That's a. that's a giant connection and so the thought was, hey, if this guy, okay, they make this Manchurian candidate and make them gun down all these people, some people think you didn't even do it. They think they shot in the room and then the agents did it and they killed all these people and then there's bullets coming out. All these different windows and all these different areas and like, oh my God, fuck it. You know, it's exhausting. It's exhausting and it's also horrific, man. I mean the whole thing's horrific. The idea that they think that the government would create a false flag that by the way didn't do anything second amendment still in place, but that they would create a false flag and they would be willing to gun down what did that he killed like 50 plus people and shot like 500 something fucking insane like that, that, that would be the, that that's they would get together and go, you know, we gotta do we gotta get this guy and get them, get them to shoot all these people and that's how we're going to get rid of guns is totally ineffective.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       It hasn't done anything.

Speaker 3:          01:23:51       No. A lead here. Here's the thing, and I'm not the first person to make this point about guns, is people who are big, strong second amendment. People say that. Why? Because whenever I advocate for gun control, people say, oh good that only the governor will have guns, which is, it's not a bad argument, right? It's not. I, I understand that argument. Uh, but the whole point of view keeping your guns to protect yourself from the government is that the government's going to take your rights away. So you need to have your guns to protect your rights. Well, the government already took your rights away. They're already reading every email. They're already reading, listening on every. You already lost your right to privacy. They let you keep your guns while they took the rest of your rights away. So now you still have your guns. Now why don't you go get your rights back? You have your gun that they're never going to do it,

Speaker 2:          01:24:33       right? So already report was an interesting take on that, right? Like the, the one day technology to reach a point, you know, for them it was like through those little psychic dudes that um, we're going to be able to predict future crime. Right. And then he arrested you for a future crime. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:24:48       [inaudible]. Yeah. That's kind. Well, they already cut. Yeah. They kind of do that. Now they can arrest you for a conspiracy to commit. Okay. Crime.

Speaker 2:          01:24:54       But you don't even have to have a crime, right? You just have some emails, talk and shit. I, you get to have a role playing thing that you do with your wife. We talk about, you know, listen to you and I, we're Bonnie and Clyde and we're going to take down the government and they just fucking kick down your door in the middle of the night. Yeah. What's that? Who's that comic? Who had the ice agents breakdown? That guy. I started following him after that. He made a joke. Yeah. What was the joke? Oh, I forget. But that was fun. That's pretty funny by the way, to. That guy's pretty funny. I do know my phone. I forgot that story. He tells us hilarious about those ice or the ice cops coming into his place. What is his name? Jake Jake parttime, standup comic podcast hosts and self-described pizza delivery guy, who in a strange twist of fate recently found himself debating immigration policy with for homeland security agents in his home. The agent's paint him in early morning visit last Sunday because of some jokes. He tweeted about Cinco de Mayo. Holy Shit. Yeah. Okay. This is what he said. Here's how Cinco de Mayo works in 2018 white people allowed to culturally appropriate on the condition that you helped destroy ice. You kill one ice agent. You get to wear

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       some barrel to kills you. Get to wear a Poncho. But the problem is that you can't joke around about killing an agent because there's, you know. So if he had a Sirius xm radio show, he'd be fired right now. Oh yeah. Well they fired Nick Depaulo for that, for saying something very similar to that. And so I say about that. It's like, so nick can't make a joke about someone going into a university, go, hey, next school shooter. That was his joke. Next, the professor, please go to the Berkeley and go to the teacher's lounge or something like that. Right. Which everyone knows. It's obviously a joke. He's a goddamn comedian. Jesus, he's a right wing community. Can we see everybody? So, so, but you can go on those same radio shows and they'll same radio stations and you can advocate for killing hundreds of thousands of people in another country that you don't know and nobody says shit all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       People do that. People lie about. So that's the. That's the weird thing, you know, we can have a torture program in America. Nobody goes, you know, it's just weird that the. And then the media goes along, they don't even call it torture. They call it enhanced interrogation techniques because we're doing it. But Nick said that that's all of a sudden. So it's just such a weird squiggly bullshit line of morality and, and so and now Nicole would be better off for it anyway. Yeah. Nick will be better off for it and he has a podcast now, but I think unfortunately he's doing a subscription service, which I tried to talk all these guys out of because you can't hear it at all for free. You have to pay and I don't know, but it limits a bad idea. Yeah, it limits your growth. I mean, he's a famous comedian, so I'm sure he'll get some money and I know he's probably doing really well with it, but it's just.

Speaker 1:          01:27:35       It's impossible to grow. Is it a subscription service? Jamie's shaking his head on Patriot for 10 bucks or more. He doesn't give you more. So start at 10 and then keep adding more. So now all we do is we need to give all the way all our stuff for free, except we do a couple of weeks. We'd maybe do a couple extra hours a week for our patrons. That's like bonus, right? So you don't, but you don't want to. That's not the worst thing in the world. I just think that people have different. You do bonus stuff. No, no. Everything's free. Everything's free. You're really lucky. Your super, super popular. Yeah, but when I wasn't super popular it was all free too. Yeah. I had it free in the beginning when I was getting a thousand downloads. It's always been free. I just. I just want to just start to kick it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       Kick in for you. When did you started to take off this show? Two years ago. Three years ago, something like that. Really say about two years ago. Three years ago. Was it an issue or what is it? You had a special guest that. What was it you think? I don't know. It's momentum. Just over time. Just, just always. Just constantly doing it. Grinding, being in here, delivering on three or four days a week. Yeah. You, you do your best. Do your best. Get better at it. Make mistakes, apologize for your mistakes. Keep going. Because when I. When I did your show last time, I just in my head ever since like I always like you are doing what I want to do. Like you don't. I loved what I go, Joe Doe because

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       people always try and discredit men. No, know how I got into a position where I have to worry about being discredited. I'm a fucking nightclub Jaguar comedian and afterward, that's why you're like, I don't have to cage fighting. I spoke the pod. I'm not a reputable person. I was like, I want to be. You want to be who I want to be. I'm at a reputable person, go fuck you. You know, I do my best to be honest. You know, I mean, I approach issues and in an honest way, but I'm not your source of reason, but you know what I mean? I'm not, I'm not that guy. I want to be a provocateur. I want to be the guy in the outside throwing spitballs that's, that's who I want to be doing. I am doing that. Somehow I got caught up in this thing where people are going to try to discredit you. Goddamn it. It's so.

Speaker 2:          01:29:47       I'm confused. I'm confused by this, this Alex Jones thing, because although I don't support a lot of the things that he said, I don't know why more people don't think that this could be a real problem, that they could just throw that hate speech blanket on things and if I didn't have that experience of talking to that woman was, she was describing the Douglas Murray, Sam Harris' podcast, which doesn't have a single slur. It is no hateful rhetoric mean. It's not hate speech. I listened to it. It's just a description. I mean it's, it's a discussion rather. So you have that insight. I know. I know how calmly and confidently she said it's hate speech. It was like, you know what it was like, do you remember those old commercials where um, there was a guy and he was eating with another guy and he was saying that if you buy drugs, you support terrorism.

Speaker 2:          01:30:38       Yes. Like what do you mean? He's like, it's a fact. It's just a fact. If act fact and he's eating a salad, he's a no nonsense guy. Fact honey, what do you mean its effect? Its effect. If Act fact, you buy pot, you're supporting terrorism, but it's basically what you said. It's hate speech. It's basically the same sort of self righteous indignation. Yeah. Yeah. Where she didn't, but when I was pressing her on it, it was almost like she was my boss and I couldn't talk to her about. I'm like, I don't work for you. Do you understand that this kind of, this method of communication that you're accustomed to, this does not apply here you. You have to. You have to discuss these ideas. I want to know the merit of your thoughts. You know, I want to see where you, where your thought process laws that you could just throw this hate speech blanket on things and it turns out there was no thought and there was no consideration.

Speaker 2:          01:31:26       There was no examination. She didn't know the content of the conversation and her confidence in saying that it was hate speech was merely towing the company line. The same company line that got James Damore fired for the Google memo. You know, you, you talked to actual evolutionary biologists and people understand psychology and people who are clinical psychologists will talk to you about the real differences between men and women. Would he actually said in these documents where he's. He didn't make some sort of a quantitative like like a ruling that women are less valuable or that women are worth less money or that women are in somehow in any way, shape or form inferior. He simply wrote about clinical studies that have shown tendencies to gravitate towards different professions and even had a page and a half in that about how there's ways that we could encourage more women to get into tech, so it was.

Speaker 2:          01:32:25       It was not negative in any way towards women, but I saw all these people describing it as hateful rhetoric and then that it was reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes. Like what with actual studies, actual studies of science. Those are real. These are harmful gender stereotypes because they don't add up to your vision of Narnia diversity that you did that only exists in Wakanda and some cloud somewhere that you. You've. You've put up. These are not real numbers. There's reasons why people gravitate towards certain professions. Some of them are cultural, some of them are biological. They're fascinating to study, but it doesn't mean that a person who becomes a nurse is any better than a person who becomes a carpenter or vice or a guy who becomes a surgeon is any better than someone who becomes a computer coder. This is not what anyone's saying. What they're saying is there's reasons why people find different things interesting and some of them might be the amount of testosterone they have in their system and the fact they have x, y chromosomes, their their genetic history that the history of their family and the culture that they grew up and there's all these variables and these variables are fascinating, but as soon as you say that, these variables must even out at the end, we must have an equality of outcome based on gender, based on race.

Speaker 2:          01:33:47       Well, you're not even talking about people anymore. Now you're just talking about something that you need to say in order for you to keep your job because you want to keep collecting ones and Zeros and you understand that there's this confusion as to why there's not more women that are leaders. Why there's not more women that are in tech. Why there's not more this. More that. Why don't you really want to concentrate on diversity. You really want to concentrate on a fairness concentrated why they're trying to keep agents out of Harvard. How about that? Because that's some real fucking racism that's going on right now. No one's saying a word about it because it's about people that are kicking ass. They're kicking ass too hard, so they're trying to. They're trying to make it more difficult. There's a giant class action lawsuit. Asians are suing Harvard because it's more difficult for them to get in than anybody else.

Speaker 3:          01:34:30       Well, when I was a kid, I was told that they pee, pee in your coke, and that's the Chinese show. Now I grew up. I know that's bullshit. That's just a thing that they would tell us. Little Kids, little kids. Just say that that's all it is, but it's like Joe St Joe to, to the Charles Murray chat with the. The antidote to that isn't to censor them. The antidote to that is good speech. More speech wasn't even if you wanted to be whatever is person to put it on their playlist, which is crazy. Somebody got a community guideline strike for putting it on their playlist. I, that's why I say we need to have it be the youtube, facebook. These are public utilities. They need to be regulated and there's no way. There's no getting around it. Right. They have super control in our culture. They have massive impact.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       But so to CBS. Right. So if you say something and CBS fires you, is that illegal? Isn't it funny that Les Moonves is getting in trouble for some he did to an actress instead of in the eighties? Yeah. And instead of him being a long time ago, was it the eighties? I think it was at least 20 years ago. So 1996 with the one. Oh, was it? Yeah. Okay. So that's still a long time. Yeah. So the eighties was, um, I'm sorry, that was confusing that with your, you're thinking of Sylvester stallone. No, I wasn't thinking. I was thinking as George. Oh, George Psychiatry, some guy popped out from the 85, said he grabbed his deck, like, Hey, let it go buddy. Jesus Christ. You know, it's uh, it's also, it's not the, you know, there was a molester at my church. We had a priest that was a molester named father hollow.

Speaker 3:          01:36:09       Shocker. Wait a minute. Is it a Catholic Church? Shocker. What the fuck man, you can't trust anybody. And the kids, we used to call them happy hands Holahan because he would always cry because whatever you come up, he'd always like to wrestle you. But he was the last kind of guy. He was a nerd. He was, he was, he's not a wrestling type guy, but he wasn't a rapist trying. He'd always come up like, hey, how am I? Like, why are you doing? You're just trying to grab me. And so we would call them happy hands, Holihan, and we would get in trouble if, if they, if our parents heard us that don't get disrespectful to be like, you know, he's grabbing our dicks.

Speaker 3:          01:36:45       So they finally, they finally caught him and I don't know why I started talking about this, but uh, yeah, why did I start talking about this? And I know because we're talking about, I always, we always had, we always thought it was like it was up to you to not get molested by him. Like if you got costs and we would laugh. We would laugh at kids who got caught at it, got less kids. So we got to run faster. Fucker. He would take, he would take us. He had a, a summerhouse right with a boat and up in Wisconsin, right. So he would take us and it was like an hour and a half away. We get in his station wagon, he take like six boys up to there and we're going to go water skiing or whatever. Right. And um, so he had the day setup where he, once you got there, you had to first do cleaning, so you had to change into your cleaning clothes and.

Speaker 3:          01:37:35       Yeah. Oh Jeez. And so every time we had to go into the room and change, he would find a reason to come into the room and wrestle one of us. Oh God. And then. But we were like, all right, we got to put up with it because we want to go onto the boat, you know, we were poor. Oh my God, poor. You know, we grew up. Isn't it funny how it's only funny if it's you, like you're allowed to laugh about getting to last as long as it's, you know, like no one could say like, you like, he. Well, he, Jimmy was on the Joe Rogan show when he was laughing about child molestation. Oh my God. Was that, is that true? Eight speech. Put the blanket on it. Hate speech. But no, it was, he was, he was talking about him getting molested. Well, he's normalizing sexual assault. He would take us. This priest would try to teach you how to ski. Know How do you teach someone how to water ski? You put your Dick in their mouth for your Dick in the mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:38:27       Do you know how to breathe under water now? Hold your nose. No spitting. So he, the way you teach them what a water skis, you put water skis out and then when they sit there on the dock and you pull away, right? Uh, and that's how you learn. So he would take us in shallow water and then he would go, it would put the skis on you so you couldn't run away from him. And then he would like put his hands. He would put his hands underneath your crotch like this from to pick you up. And then he goes, now when the boat pulls it's gonna, pull you up like this and it's going to, it's good that jerk you off and the only way to kill you gotta catch it in your mouth.

Speaker 3:          01:39:05       And so it was a fuck man. And so we looked at it like it was your job to get out of that situation. If you got caught, we all laughed at you. I remember my friend, my friend Danny, he's in the, he's in the shallow water and he's gotten off the boat, pulls you, and he goes like this, and Danny looks at his dad and he goes, he goes in front of everybody and we're laughing, laughing. Now. Did he actually molest anyone other than inappropriate touching, molested people? Oh boy. He had to leave the church and all that stuff. He believe the church that he's moving moved. He went to Arizona for a sabbatical. Yeah. Yeah. He's. He needs our prayers that this. They sent out a note, a letter to everybody's house and who was in the poof. You gave money. They give you a letter. Did hear no evil.

Speaker 1:          01:39:56       The documentary where they, you know, there was one priest that benedict who became the pope moved who went onto molesta hundred deaf kids. Oh No. Oh No. Yeah. Horrific. Horrific Shit. That, that, that process of moving people was always terrifying because they basically let them know, hey, you're not even going to be punished for this. We're just going to move. Yeah, just gonna move you. Yeah, we do. Yeah, it doesn't. I know it. I don't understand aerifying terrifying stuff. Yeah. Why isn't the FBI infiltrate the Catholic Church? Yeah. Imagine I, I did a joke about onstage while back, it was like, imagine if that many nascar drivers were fucking kids. How quick would they shut down Nascar? Nascar pulled into town, just fucked all the kids and drove around in a circle real quick. They'd be like, we gotta shut this down. This is a crazy organized,

Speaker 3:          01:40:49       but meanwhile way more people getting molested by the Catholic Church. I, I couldn't agree. And it's a terrifying

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       number when you look at the numbers of people that have just accused them of, of sexual assault and molestation. It's terrifying. Yeah, it's terrifying. And now the money they take that you give them on Sunday to go pay these people off is also. Yeah. I feel very fortunate that I ducked that. I got lucky. What was that? A Catholic school you went to Catholic school for one year. Only first grade. I was gone after first grade and uh, you know, I had friends that stayed in, I know new people that got touched, you know, it's just, it's, it's for people who outside the Catholic faith, people who are. There's something that happened and it probably happened when they told them they couldn't get married anymore because it used to be the pope could get married. The pope was allowed to have children and that priests were allowed to be married.

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       Priests were allowed to have children, but they were rock stars. You have to realize like back in the Lutheran days, the days of Martin Luther and those, those guys were fucking everybody. They would get you in that confession, in the confession with him, what you did to Delores, Delores, they're just sucking dicks all day has shown me I sucked at Dolores when they were banging everybody and then they came up with some sort of a reason why they should have to be celibate. And from then on, well, so here's what happened. Here's what I heard was what happened was that. So there was two ways to become nobility and the Bonnyville Times. You could be born noble or you could buy your way into the church and so you could become nobility and so what would happen is these rich motherfuckers who would buy the witness of the Church would die and then all their money would go to their kid.

Speaker 1:          01:42:24       Their first born in the church is like, we've got to get some. We got to get our hands on that money. And so they passed the law. Hey, nobody can get married legally. They all did. They still had kids and shit and they still had mistresses and whatever, but when they died, all their money and property went to the church. That makes sense. And so of course it's all about. But. So that's the story I heard. If, if anybody heard different levels, it's both a bed, it's a bed. It had something to do with sex as well and preventing those guys from fucking everybody you know, because they were rock stars. There was no rock stars back then. So the guys that were the spokespersons for God would most likely be the ones who had the most influence in the community. I mean, he's a kid that we went to school with who was a clearly gay and a nice guy and he was going to become a priest when we were all in high school together.

Speaker 1:          01:43:08       So as we were like riding the bus, going to high school, he was a couple of years ahead of me and he was a leaving school and he was already on his way. What does it divinity school or seminary, seminary, anything. Yeah. He was on his way and we were all like, we're all calling him father already and it was just ridiculous. We're all accepting the fact this guy was going to be a priest, but you know, for him it was. He was so obviously gay that, you know, I mean, I didn't give a shit, but I knew you could tell these gay. He's a gay guy. He never had any interest in girls. Never was around them. Kind of a, just an oddly feminine man and uh, decided to take up the priesthood and we all treated him

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       like he was different because he was going to become

Speaker 3:          01:43:53       priest is very weird. Yeah. The know priests are still treated like rock stars in the Catholic Church today.

Speaker 2:          01:44:00       Yeah. And he was. Meanwhile I was just another 16 year old kid just like us, you know, maybe he was 17 at the time and I think I was 15, but it was just, he wasn't a different than us, but we were calling him father and stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:44:12       It was just so strange. I had two uncles that went to seminary. One of them became a priest and the other one, uh, over the summer I had a friend who got pregnant and he had to stop being, get dropped out of the seminary. Wow. But when you went to my grandmother's house as you walked up the steps into their living room, the two pictures she would have greeting you was a picture of both her sons in their priest outfit. So one was actually a priest and one had to go, but that's the picture she kept up. Right guys bring it over his four kids to her house. There's the picture of Daddy, why are you in the priest outfit? One point in time. So, so yeah. That's, um, are you, are you still religious? You still go to church? No. Okay. No, I, I go because my, I go to church, a Baptist Church in Pasadena because my, my mother in law goes and she wanted, she asked me to go, oh, that's probably fun. And I said, okay, I'll go. I'm being protested by the Westboro Baptist Church tomorrow are. You were in Kansas City. Oh, very excited. Oh, that is. Ah, I've always wanted to be protesting is good for you

Speaker 2:          01:45:13       press release. And they even responded to my, my, uh, I put out a post and they had a tweet, someone who has no idea what God wants to speak and forgot that I said that if God, you know, there is a god. They said I was an atheist, which I, I'm really not. I mean, I don't consider myself anything. I don't consider myself religious. I'm not an atheist. I'm just a person who doesn't know. And I don't call it gnostic. I think I'm more agnostic than anything, but I don't even want to put a label on it. Why should I have to be someone's camp? You know, my, my opinions are allowed to evolve and I'm allowed to and I've done a lot of drugs. I've seen some shit that I can't explain, you know, and psychedelics, man will, they'll get whatever confidence you have that there's no god.

Speaker 2:          01:45:58       You go through a dmt trip and you come out and the other and you're like, okay, maybe I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Maybe I don't know anything and that's I'm in the maybe I don't know anything camp. So I said that if where there was a god, I don't know if there's a god, but if there was a god, he or she would probably very disappointed these hateful twats pretend to speak for him putting up signs and say, God hates fags. Like you really think this is what God would want. That's outrageous. And so that's what they're excited about. That you said that, that I speak for God. Oh, but they could speak for good. They see God hates fags taking. See that written anywhere? Look to the Bible never says God hates fags. That's their website is God hates fags.com. Just stop and think about that. I think they should take their facebook page away. Do they have a youtube channel?

Speaker 3:          01:46:41       Westboro Baptist Church. I have a youtube channel, but yeah, but don't. Don't use speech. Don't you think we're living in a weird era of like people wanting to just discredit people just like get rid of them. Like, oh you, you, you don't believe this. One thing that the establishment says you have to. There's only one narrative on this Syrian war and if you go, if you go away from it, you're, you're a bad person and you're alive and you're a, you're an apologist for Assad and you're a Putin puppet at all. It's like, what the fuck? No, I just have a different view on the war and it's based on facts and evidence and I don't know if you know, but those people you're trusting now were the ones who continuously lied to us. So I've never lied to you about a war. You're, you're upset because I'm skeptical of the people who constantly lie about war.

Speaker 3:          01:47:28       It's just the. And so that's just a weird thing and it's like this. But I guess it's probably always been this way, Joe. I don't know, I just, now that I'm experienced it because I'm in the public talking about this stuff and it's just weird how people are so quick to go along with the establishment, look at how the lefties are defending the intelligence community. Wishing Robert Muller of fucking happy birthday on twitter, like a bunch of idiots. So ridiculous. It's like, do you guys have any sense of history? Do you have any sense of recent history? No, it's just, it's, it shows you how the hatred of someone could make people's lizard brains excited and then rational thinking goes out. The. So I love amplicon on my show says, you know, uh, I hate trump as much as anybody, but I'm not going to let them steal my critical thinking skills. And so that's the site. And so the thing that I like about what our show does, we're very consistent. I don't have one set of rules first. People I like and another set of rules for people I have opposed.

Speaker 2:          01:48:21       And I really, really appreciate that about you. And that's one of the things that I said about you the first time we came on and say you shoot straight no matter whether it's right or left, whatever you see, you call it, like you see it. There's no partisan politics. And I think that's very important. And it's so rare it doesn't exist anymore. You know, it was, I was watching or listening rather than Sam Harris is one of his podcasts recently. Whereas guests made a really important point saying that we're in this strange time in history where the news is different depending on what channel you watch. It used to be you at different people telling you the news, now you have different news if you totally different, totally different news. Isn't that something? And it's completely partisan. I mean it's, it's 100 percent left or 100 percent right?

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       And you're either all in with us. And I feel like what we're talking about here and what you're describing is idea sports like this, this, this needing to shut people down. They want to get a result. They want to win the game. You know what? Right now they just slam dunked on Alex Jones and they're high fiving all around the coffee shop. All the Baristas are fucking psyched. You know, they're, they're really excited to make an espresso. Yeah, we shut them down, we fucking shut them down and we're gonna put our masks and our bike locks are going to whack. Trump supporters are in the head tonight. Like this is is a strange time for ideas. You can't, you can't even, you can't even objectively assess the merits of an idea because the ideas have already been clearly delineated. Very clearly

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       acceptable, acceptable parameters of this conversation. These are the acceptable ideas. And if you go over them, you are persona non grata. Yeah. That's it. And you know, meanwhile you turn on NBC, it's just littered with liars.

Speaker 2:          01:50:02       Yeah. And so is Fox and of course you know what I'd love Shepard Smith. Shep Smith. He is a fascinating character. When he is doing over there is going against everything. He goes to get like the. You ever seen the what Sean Hannity says versus Shepard Smith? Yeah. I've seen those videos. Fucking hilarious. Pretty funny. And he's right. And he's not right. He's right. Constitutionally, like what he's saying, when he's describing what Sean Hannity said versus the reality. He's right. He's right in terms of what is a law. He's right in terms of what you know, whether or not something is legal or whether or not it's unethical. Yeah. And

Speaker 3:          01:50:43       you know that that's the thing about Shep Smith, like, uh, when he gets something wrong, I think he's just genuinely getting it wrong. I don't think it's because he's trying to push it in there. He, he might be unconsciously been corrupted, but not consciously. How did he get over there? Was the over there? I don't, I don't know. You tell me. Do you remember when Hannity was on with combs? It was Hannity and colmes took the weasel earliest weakest looking liberal. They could find a guy. Looks like he just sweats canola oil and they put him on TV opposite like this. Well, Dino right wingers. You how sean met him right wingers used to hire Alan comes to to come perform at his parties and he would just cower in the corner. And I'm kidding. I feel bad making fun. Of Him, because he's not alive anymore. He's not Alan Colmes. I'm pretty sure he's dead. Oh, when did he die? A like a year ago or two years ago. Can you google that and see if he. I'm pretty nerdy and him split up. The band broke up long before that. Yeah. Yeah. It's like crosby, stills, Nash and young in February. Last February last year. So yeah, he was. This guy's very nice guy. I'm sure he was a nice guy, but it was almost like he didn't get riled up on

Speaker 2:          01:51:52       to keep his job. He got riled up enough to make liberals look like pushovers and so the people at home and Kansas and be like stupid liberals. Yeah. Sean Hannity's, my man. Sean Hannity's got American. Yes. You know, like Sean Hannity with his big fat white bread eaten face and that he was just the one who is telling the truth about the real problem and the dems in it's. It's so fascinating to see that video was Shepard Smith just clearly and, and, and, and, and very cleanly dissecting everything that Hannity says.

Speaker 3:          01:52:25       Well, the, the ironic part is right here. Oh yeah, that's the video. Six minutes of it, and we can't play this though, right? There's no evidence to prove any of this was true after the 18 months. The Russian investigation is the opposite of a hoax. Now, indictments against Russian organizations and persons have been handed up. It's hilarious. Yeah. It goes on and on. It's a Fox News. Shep Smith shuts down. Sean Hannity's lies and propaganda. How is, how is Shep Smith still at Fox News? How does that work? Are you telling me? It's interesting, right? Yeah, it is. If this is Sean Hannity's, eyes look like he's a drugged up. Yeah, they're cheesing anchor, so on some pills, Isley, he looks like something's wrong. Who's the chief anchor of their breaking news division, but let me tell you about what Sean Hannity has been doing is that woman on Alexandria, Kazuyo Cortez from New York who beat Joe Crowley and she's the big democratic socialists and everybody's got their bushing and not over it because, oh my God, she's the Corporate Democrats hater the right wind.

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       She freaks out. Right? Because he's actually going to help people and Sean Hannity has been like reading out like that. Look what she likes. She wants to have medicare for all. She wants to have free college. She wants to living wage. She wants to end the war and people. I'm sure almost half his audience are like, that sounds looking pretty good. That's A. I don't know if you know Sean. Things are tough out here in the heartland. Is that possible to do all those things? I don't have to worry about medical bills for my fucking kids anymore and I tried for that. I don't have to worry about sending my kids to college. It's awesome because you have more. You have endless money for these wars. I'm sure you have some money for us, right? I mean college subsidized, like why is it so expensive? So it actually backfiring.

Speaker 3:          01:54:06       In fact, I there was a poll that Fox and friends and friends and friends put out that said Fox and refresh it. It said, do you think the 32 point $6,000,000,000,000 for Bernie Sanders Medicare for all plan is worth it? Of course they left out the other part which turns out it saves two point something trillion dollars, right? That's the part they leave out to their gaslighting and their own viewers, just like all news organizations have their own viewers. So they, that pole pole went up and 73 percent of the Fox and friends and friends and friends. Viewers said they want Bernie Sanders Medicare for all 73 percent and 30,000 people voted in that bowl. So that's not just nothing. So I, I, it's, it's like, so now they're, they think that scary socialism scary. It doesn't scare people anymore because now there's the internet. People can go look what it's like to live in Denmark.

Speaker 3:          01:54:52       Once a license do say, do you support Communism, do sport socialism? Then people say, no, no, we don't support Communism d support, medicare yet support social security. Of course, for public education. Yes. Okay. Are you support public roads? Are you for the post office? We, for the fire department and put. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is all socialism. Yeah. You like libraries, south socialism and good aspects to it and so particularly like free health care. Who the fuck wants someone that you love to be shit out of luck where they can't go to a doctor because they can't afford it and what if they die? Come on. So when I went to Norway and my friend Steve Owen to Norway to and something that he noticed his Norwegian, oh, did we ever anyway guys and the guys get the Fellas, I've got to tell you, they do wear comically tight pants. The guys in Europe, it's like, you know, my wife says, it's like, you know those, she goes up to the fashion designers are fucking with you. You know that, right? It's like, oh, I always wanted him to know what your keys look like. Shrink wrapped. That's fantastic.

Speaker 3:          01:55:59       How many comics you see on stage? You can see what their fucking phone make is key. Oh, you drive a BMW. That's nice. It's like, what the fuck? Make sure they can't run away quick. We have their legs bound up skinny jeans anyway, but over there when they talk about a health care we do, we go, you look at you like free healthcare. They go, we don't call it free healthcare. We call it included because it's included in your taxes. Just like just like your public education here, just like your streets and roads here, just like your department, fire department, your Chi, it's included. We don't go. You get free police, you get free fire department. No, it's included in your Texas road road maintenance and so that's the funny thing that Sean Hannity and the right wing, they think they can scare people by saying, look, all this stuff, they're off.

Speaker 3:          01:56:39       No. If the Democrats would have been off, Hillary Clinton would have been offering people something, maybe half the country who didn't vote when it came out and voted for her. So that's the thing you use. The Democrats have nothing to offer people in, which is why there are a shit show at a failed party and they've lost their wiped out at every level of government. And so if they take over, it's like if the congress, there's a big chance to chance they might. Uh, it's just, again, it's, they're, they're the ones doing the bidding for trump. They just handed him more money for defense than he even asked for. So if trump had, here's the thing, here's the funny thing, if trump is a maniac, they'll to say he's unhinged. He's a maniac. Haiti shouldn't have his finger on the button. Let's give them $80, million more dollars for bombs.

Speaker 3:          01:57:18       Those two things are incongruent. Those don't go together. So you're bullshitting me on one end or another. Do you think he's going to get through this without going to jail? He, um, yes. Do you think your son's going to go to jail? I, you know, I'm not good at predicting things, but they should all go to jail because they're probably all corrupt doing corrupt shit. But if you put a special prosecutor on anybody I could, they'll find crimes on anybody you know, the, they're prosecuting manafort for. It doesn't have anything to do with the election or trump's campaign. It's all shit. Before the trump's campaign, when he was in collusion with Tony, but that's the from the Podesta group, he was funneling money from fucking Ukraine and they were giving it through the Podesta found day. So it is what he's getting charged. He's, he's getting charged for shit that happened before he ever even worked for trump.

Speaker 3:          01:58:04       So that's the part they don't tell you. They go metaphor charge, but then 80th paragraph, they go, this has nothing to do with the election. Every articles like that. So it's just a matter of them deciding to put a microscope up your ass and find things you did wrong. They put a microscope but Bill Clinton's ass about some land deal in Arkansas and ended up going to a blowjob in the oval office and he got impeached for it. So they got rid of the special prosecutor after that because they realize that you'll find crimes on anybody if you put a special prosecutor. Um, and they. And now they bring it back for trump. They don't, they're not prosecuting literal fucking war criminals. Joe Literal. We know their war criminals. There was a thing called the torture program. We know that it was a real thing. No one goes to jail.

Speaker 3:          01:58:46       Nobody's prosecuted, but God dammit, they got a special prosecutor for trump. Not that they shouldn't, but we all know if you put a special prosecutor on anybody, Washington, they're gonna find a lot of fucking crimes. Yeah, they know what they're doing. That's all the same game of this thing about not registering as four at age and so they all played the same game. They don't register as foreign agents until they get caught and then the government allows them to go backtrack and reregister, but they're not doing that at all. We're not going to let but metaphor it. They eat. He made a mistake. So again, there's ways to oppose trump and the Russia thing, isn't it? The way to oppose trump is you offer people something else. He ran to the left of Hillary Clinton on foreign policy. He wanted to end our foreign wars is according to his rhetoric and his campaign, he wanted to give everybody healthcare member. Everyone's going to get healthcare and it's going to be cheaper. That was his. Of course he stayed. He's doing the exact opposite. Yeah, so who does the thing they say they're gonna do whatever. Whoever does the thing. Who's ever done it? Oh No, nobody. That's why he got. That's why democracy is not based on trust. It's based on mistrust. It's based on transparency.

Speaker 2:          01:59:48       You remember that bit? That bill, Bill Hicks, he used to do about a. That is something along the lines of, I think that when you get elected, they bring into a smoky room filled with globalists and they show you an angle of the Kennedy assassination that you've never seen before. They roll it out. Any questions? What's my agenda? But it almost seems like that's what happens. Obama, Obama changed his tune, remembering the hope and change website that had all that shit about whistleblowers afforded protection. That was all gone the day he got elected. That was a while ago. It took a while for him being an office where they realized that it was still in there on deleted it all.

Speaker 3:          02:00:28       He disbanded his own followers. Right. So when he got elected, Barack Obama, he had all these young people who were activated and they signed up. He had a mailing list, eat at all and we want to go do shit for you want to go back. And they were like, get rid of them. And he did. He got rid of them because you can't control them. They, yes, they fuck them. And that's, you know. And you know, then Bernie Sanders has his campaign and says, everybody, we've got to fight this fucking evil machine. And then on a dime he goes, hey, by the way, let's join this evil machine. It's a little thing happens. Um, I don't know. You know, I really don't know. I bought it good at that. I know what people have said. Chris Hedges said that Bernie Sanders didn't want to end up like Ralph Nader who was unfairly held accountable again for the Democrats. The Democrats lost to heal to fucking a game show host. And that's what this is all about. They can't come to terms with this and they don't want us to examine the system that gave us trump and they don't want to examine how they could have the most qualified person to book couldn't even beat fucking Donald Trump. That's how qualified you are. You.

Speaker 2:          02:01:25       Well, they wanted trump to win because they thought he'd be the easiest guy to beat in the election.

Speaker 3:          02:01:29       That was the song. Isn't it funny that nobody gets mad at them? Nobody's upset at Chris Hayes for having empty podiums of trump for an whole show, which I saw and then he wags his finger at Surandon. You're the son of a bitch. You prop trump up and you didn't cover Bernie Sanders because you were fucking told not to, and we know that for a fact because the Ed Schultz and now you're going to pretend like you're a sanctimonious fucking brick and you're going to wag your finger at people with no money and no power. Meanwhile, you have the biggest microphone of anybody and you fucking prop Donald Trump up and you don't take responsibility. That's why he's a piece of shit and couldn't eat. Very excited, very excited. That's why he's doing their bidding right now. All those people are doing their bidding because Ed Schultz revealed and fill down and you, if you tell the truth, they will fucking fire your ass. They've got guys like Lee Veggie and and Rachel maddow pretending they don't know how net neutrality works. I don't know what it is. A good as it gets a big thing. I know it's important, but I don't know which way we'll see how it rolls out. I don't know what the middle.

Speaker 3:          02:02:27       That's what tools or hate. I'm not saying I wouldn't do it too. I'm just not being offered 30 grand a day to sell my soul. I would. It seems confusing to me that they're thinking about using hillary again because it seems to me that she's starting to make her way back into new cycles and given speeches. She has a pack that's supposed to be supporting women who are running for office except not Cynthia Nixon. Well, she's going to prop up the most corrupt fucker in New York has had for a long time. It was supposed to be about just women whose gender. She says that's what the gender based. She said she was starting a pack to help encourage women to run. That's. I read that in an interview with her and I'm like, really? Why isn't that pack? Then supporting Cynthia Nixon. Why are you supporting, you know, what the fuck she was, she independent.

Speaker 3:          02:03:11       She running a Democrat and she's running against Cuomo. And um, so of course I'm was running for mayor. No governor was running for governor in New York. I knew she was running for something I didn't know was that big. And you know, Cuomo is one of the most corrupt. He said he, he's just a, again, we have one party rule, we have corporate rule and all these people are in bed with the corporations because their body, because that's the way our elections work and that's the whole. That's why Hillary Clinton has a private position and a public position and I'm not saying she's the only one, but she's the one that we know actually literally said that because of wikileaks, thank God. And that again, I'll go back to Julian signs. The fact that none of the reporters in the United States are sticking up for Julian Assan shows you that what they do is fucking wrestling and they don't do real journalism wrestling.

Speaker 3:          02:03:56       And what's really interesting about the Julia naissance things, if you ask people what he did that because of the reductionist thinking, because of the, they've allowed this narrative to play for it. They'll say he's accused of sexual assault and when you find out the actual facts of it, his woman consensual sex and then the middle of the night he stuck it in without a condom. And they were calling. They were calling it surprised sex. I don't know. But there's no. I mean it didn't make any sense. And why the pressure him to the United States for surprise sex that he had in. Where was it? Norway or somewhat the first. Of course they want to kind of come at you. Of course, if they want to get the CIA wants to get you the first thing to do, oh he's probably by betsy. He's a rapist. Let's get some going.

Speaker 3:          02:04:37       And that whole prosecutor who tries to prosecutor was discredited for doing so. They were apologized to Julian asides the UN stuck up for his. Stood up for Julian to size and the woman. So this is why they're still. They still have them. Hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy. What is he going to do? They want to kick him out, right? Well, the ACL was, I think supporting him in the United States. So, and you know, certain people of character or are, are supporting him or not him, but the idea of journalistic integrity, freedom of speech, the right to publish. If you watch that movie, the post, which was all about Daniel Ellsberg and the, and the Vietnam, uh, the Pentagon papers which expose that for administrations were lying to us about the Vietnam War. Not a Republican, not a democrat. They're all again the same. Fucking two wings of the same party to right wings.

Speaker 3:          02:05:25       It's the military industrial party. And the hero of that movie is the woman who was the head of the Washington Post. Not Daniel Ellsberg. He was a real fucking hero. But how can you make that movie in this day and age and not mentioned Chelsea manning not mentioned Edward Snowden and not go, you know, Daniel Ellsberg's up today. We imprison them and that's what we're doing. We in prison, the Daniel Ellsberg's up today, and everybody who watched panels of the actors from that movie and the director and sit around and talk, nobody ever brings the shit up. It's unfucking believable to me that they don't understand that they're just, they're doing pr. That's propaganda. Look how good our Washington Post Washington Post went on to lead us into every fucking war after that movie was supposedly made, right? So after, after they did that and they printed that, they backed every goddamn more sense. They're the ones who told us that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.

Speaker 3:          02:06:13       And it was irrefutable. That was the headline on their editorial page. It wasn't [inaudible]. It was their editorial board said air refutable doubt always at that fake news should they have their facebook page taken down that actually led to the fucking death of millions of people. So, um, this is what this is. This is why I have a show. This is what I'm talking about. And thank God the a. In a sense, thank God the media sucks so bad because now I get to do their job and I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a C student Jag off nightclub comedian and I do my job better than they do. Well, you don't have a boss. That's the thing, not you're not beholding to anybody. I was just offered a TV show and I want to say by who, and I'm a, I was Satan and I was offered anything I wanted me.

Speaker 3:          02:06:58       You want to do, do you want to do five days in the morning? You want to do one day a week? You want to do this? I'll give you your own studio, your own crew, the whole deal. And I had to look at the guy and I said, you have been waiting my whole career for somebody to make me an offer like this. And I just have to tell you know things. Wow. And he's like, what? What do you want? And I said, I don't want anything. I already have everything I want. And um, he and I got to want to drive across town to go do a show and somebody else's studio. I walk out my back door, I do my show in my garage. I don't fucking need your money. I don't need a boss, I don't need it. I'm selling out theaters right now.

Speaker 3:          02:07:27       That's what I want to do. I go, I don't want to. I want to spend less time in the studio, more time tutoring, because that's fun, dude. It is unbelievable. I, I, the best part of my life is right now. It's unbelievable. I'm so glad I didn't kill myself eight years ago. I was so. I was so close to killing myself. I'm so glad I did it. And it was my hatred for people that kept me alive. Amazing. Because was. I didn't want people. I already said this to you. I didn't want people to go out high. He didn't make it. I was like, fuck you. I am making it and then I'm going to kill myself. I don't say that. They'll use that as a see that that killed himself. He didn't get suicided. It didn't get silenced. I didn't. So I was, I was just back in Chicago and I played a place called Thalia Hall, which is fucking, that's where Brian Callen just did his, uh, his new special beautiful.

Speaker 3:          02:08:15       Have a video up from that show on my channel. It was so I used to live in, when I started to be a comedian, I moved to that neighborhood. It was back then. It wasn't a nice neighborhood, right? It was like a tougher neighborhood, but I got to live closer to the city and all my comedian friends live there because it was affordable and now it's being gentrified and shit and they've got this new theater and it's. I mean it's not new, but it's old and they refurbished it and it's 600 people and I came out and it was just like, it was just like heaven, you know, and I get my whole career. I tried to figure out how to get people to stand up at the end of my set. Like how do I get what I don't want to do it in a shitty way. I want to manipulate them, but I want to have come from my heart and inspire people and make them want to stand up, you know, to get a standing ovation.

Speaker 3:          02:08:52       Right. And now they stand up when I come out. Wow. I don't have to worry about it. It's already done. So this is the greatest time of my life and it's because nobody, you know, people can't get anywhere else. What I'm doing, uh, is just nothing else like it. You know, Bill Maher of God bless his soul, you know, he's a corporatist and he's part of the problem. Right. And I like, I like Bill Maher. I'd love to. I read his book that he read about who wrote about common. I bet you ain't even know he had one. It was, it was really funny. No, no, no. The uh, the novel. I wrote that true. I think it was called true story story. Yeah. I love that. That's a great book. Twice was the one guy's name. Shit. Shit. Fuck. Chink. And something else. He better be careful.

Speaker 3:          02:09:32       You better be careful because that's enough about that book. Ethnic slur, right? The characters names. That's right. Those from the eighties, nineties, nineties. Yeah. So he wrote about it. He wrote about how it comedy modern day comedy got started and how it was really interesting book about he would go on the road and it would be the, he'd be the first comedian that club had ever seen and they didn't know. He was like, the waitresses didn't know he was leaving the next week. Shit like that. It was like, it didn't sink in how things work. It was such an interesting book to read anyway, but now he's, you know, he brags that he gave a million dollars to Barack Obama, which fantastic too. But did he really? Yeah. I'm not on air so, you know, it's just like I get it. I W I aspire to be Bill Maher. I aspire to be a millionaire for 30 years and a little bit out of touch.

Speaker 3:          02:10:14       That's good for you. You did it. You did it. Oh God. So anyway, but it's good. You know, again, I get upset because I want him to be better or be more like I want them to be, but it actually helps me. Right. So the more he's he shifts to the right, the more his audience comes to me, right? And the more I get on stage, I'll have to do as much as an ame on stage at a live show and people fuck, boom. Right? Yeah. It's progressives don't like him. Now he's. He doesn't not happen. When did that happen for Bernie Sanders campaign? Real. He doesn't get that. There's a difference that there's a difference between the Hillary and Bernie Sanders. How could he not get it? You tell me. He, he's had we, we, we, I played videos of him saying that. Yeah. Now they were basically the same.

Speaker 3:          02:10:55       What's the big deal? Then? These progressives are just being babies. And isn't it funny? Progressives are being babies when they won't support warmongering corporatists, but centrus corporatist start being adults. When they fuck over progressive's, they don't. They don't ever accommodate them. They don't ever drop their values and come over and be progressive. We're always supposed to go that way. They never go the other way. That unity means, hey, you guys shut the fuck up and fall in line and become a corporatist. That's what they mean when they say unity and it ain't happening, and I'm telling you, Bernie Sanders is making a big mistake by not starting a third party right now. That's how you influence. If he does not win the Democratic nomination in 20 slash 20, what is he built over these four years? Fucking nothing. Do you think he's going to run? Run in 20 slash 20?

Speaker 3:          02:11:35       Yes. That's what this is all about. That's what this is all about. Thought he had said he was done. I thought he said he wasn't gonna. Try again. He's running again. He thinks if there's. I'll make that prediction. Yeah, I'll make that prediction that you a dollar. I'll bet you $2 doubled down. Five bucks. Okay. All right. I'll go five bucks. So I'll tell you how you can afford five bucks. Best time of my life. I can't believe. I can't believe how amazing. It's so nice to not have no representation right now, by the way. I have not been better. It's almost yes. That's even better. You get all the Cheddar. I was working. I was working with this guy, Alex Murray, who's a great guy. I love Alex Murray and he got me specials. You got to be comedy central specialist who especially special. He sold a book for me. Fucking great guy. I love Alex Murray, but he got real busy, right? He represents a bunch of really Chris hardwick and know he had anyway and Jim Gaffigan, all these guys he represents. So he got too busy for me, which I understand. It was weird. He stopped, so we stopped working together. Right. Is My show.

Speaker 1:          02:12:33       Ah, right. Is that like what the fuck? And all of a sudden people started

Speaker 3:          02:12:39       showing up at clubs when I'm there and I'm like, Whoa, whoa. And we start selling out weeks ahead of time.

Speaker 1:          02:12:45       I did the Chicago theater in how many seats is that? Thirty 700. Jesus, you are popular. Pretty popular. Jesus Christ. Don't know what happened, but I did the Chicago theater many years ago and I remember saying something about the podcast and I said, how many you guys listen to the podcast? And it was a roar through the crowd. And I went, whoa. That was when I realized I was like, whoa. Oh yeah. Was going on. Yeah. Like I didn't think I thought I was going to be like 10 percent of the people. I got it. I don't, I don't pay attention to anything, man. This is one of the secrets from me staying me and people and people have accused me of changing. It's called I evolve as a person. I, I learn more. I studied myself. I'm ruthlessly

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       critical of myself. I'm very analytical, self analytical, and I don't like a lot of the stuff I do. This is just so I get better at it hopefully. But, um, I just didn't know that anybody was paying attention. I didn't, wasn't. I wasn't looking. I don't look at numbers. I occasionally look and I go to, I don't want any think about that and I don't think about it. I just do it. But that moment where I was in front of 3,700 people and know how many guys listened to the podcast and I went, I was like, Whoa, okay. This is not what I expected. I thought it was going to be a bunch of people, people like, no ma'am, no fear booked or UFC whatever. And um, that's when I realized something was going on there. That's a weird feeling, right? When you realize all these people are coming to see you because of something you did yourself.

Speaker 3:          02:14:17       Yeah. It was the yes, because it's something you did and it was, it was when I stopped trying almost. There's one

Speaker 2:          02:14:22       marilyn, Marilyn stop trying is when w WTF?

Speaker 3:          02:14:26       Yes. That same with me. Like when I stop censoring myself or overthinking, like I would go on stage and I would have my jokes down to a science. Right. And that's obviously youtube is not that way and I just let it rip and that's the thing that connected with people. It's so amazing. And it, and the Burbank Burbank Comedy Festival at that flappers comedy club and they asked me to go, would you do your podcast here at 5:00 on a Thursday or whatever. And I was like okay, I'll do it for you. Whatever. And I did about five people there who's going to fucking show up at 5:00 on a Thursday in Burbank, right? Places almost full. And I was like, oh, that's what I was like, Woo, what the fuck's going on? Five o'clock. And there were, there were girls there. I am not, I'll never forget this, that they came from Compton when they were like, oh, we had to get off work.

Speaker 3:          02:15:11       We had to get a ride. When we got here, we worked. He had to see. And I was like, wow, I'm really connecting with people right? That, that don't look like me, but they share the same ideology and it just, it's like when I would go see George Carlin, if you ever went and saw him live, there were 80 year old hippies and they were a teenager kids and there was everybody in between and that's what it looks like at my shows. And it makes me so fucking happy. It's so that's when it, that's when it's. I was like, whoa. And I was like, thanks flappers for making me do this show, because now I realize,

Speaker 2:          02:15:40       and Jimmy, I'm happy for you too, and I, I really think that you're one of the only people out there that really doesn't toe a line one way or the other. You really do speak the truth. And I said that about you the first time I said about you before I ever had you on. I was like, this guy just says what he thinks. Whether you agree with them or disagree with them, you can't point to him and say, Oh, this guy is just a left wing hack, or this guy is a right wing apologist, or whatever it is. You just say what you think and that is so refreshing and it's so valuable. There's just not enough of that today. There's not enough. And these people that are super intelligent that think that if you vote one way it's a protest vote and he shouldn't have a protest vote because you're throwing away your vote and you gonna let the right wing people when like you're missing everything. You're missing this whole thing. This whole thing is super complicated,

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       it's very complicated and the only way to see through the haze is to be honest and you're one of the only people that's doing it. Well. I really appreciate you saying that and I think that there's a lot of common ground, especially when it comes to getting corporations fingers out of our government and ending wars. I think a lot of people agree on that and that actually scares the establishment. Yeah, I think it does. Jimmy. Joe, thanks for being here, man. Thanks for having me. I really, really appreciate it.
